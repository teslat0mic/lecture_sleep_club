1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,639
So we're trying to understand the relation of the perceived subject, of the perceiving subject to the perceived world, as he says at the end of the chapter on the phenomenal, after the experience of the body and objective thought.

2
00:00:20,639 --> 00:00:30,480
So we've done that, and we've gotten up to the point where on 83, he says that's what we're trying to understand.

3
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:39,680
And then we tried to understand it first by way of physiology, that's that first chapter.

4
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,720
We did that.

5
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,239
That's the phantom limb issue.

6
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:54,319
That's the attempt to understand the body as a mechanism in which there are inputs through the nerves that get up to the brain, and then we've got something in our mind.

7
00:00:54,319 --> 00:01:00,720
And the phantom limb phenomena just won't fit into that mechanistic picture.

8
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:13,119
In Monero Fontichargon, that's to talk like an empiricist, that's to talk about the in-itself, and that whole mechanistic way doesn't work.

9
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:33,679
We can't explain the phantom limb except as being in, as unless we bring in the usual refrain, which you've got to get used to, the third, the other, unless we bring in as that we're always already engaged in coping with the world.

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:44,879
And I always want to add, in trying to get a maximal grip on the world, though Alva points out to me rightly, no passage I've come across yet quite says that.

11
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,879
I do think that's what Marilyn Monte does say and think at some point.

12
00:01:49,879 --> 00:02:01,800
But in any case, you certainly, I mean, there's no disagreement that what we're trying to do is we're always engaged in trying to cope with whatever it is that comes around.

13
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:03,800
And so that happened.

14
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,760
And that happens, it's on 215.

15
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,439
215?

16
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,359
I wonder if I went to a different book.

17
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:10,999
Let's see.

18
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,480
No, I couldn't be 215.

19
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,920
Look at one.

20
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:26,200
It could be, what I'm looking for is something in the body and mechanistic psychology, where he does talk about being in the world.

21
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:32,679
Oh, yeah, it's on 215 for the funny reason that it comes back much later.

22
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,399
215 can't be right.

23
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:36,679
Sorry for a minute here.

24
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:40,599
I have to figure out what I was doing when I wrote for it.

25
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,239
It's 115.

26
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:53,319
But I just jump ahead to the footnote on 115 to sort of sum up where we are and what happened in the chapter about the phantom limb.

27
00:02:53,320 --> 00:03:05,800
He says in a sentence that we've already seen that the phantom limb, which is a modality of the body image, we'll talk about that in a minute, is understood in terms of the general movement of being in the world.

28
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,639
This is always going to be the punchline.

29
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:24,599
Whatever the phenomena is that he's going to talk about, he's going to show you that you can't understand it as in itself, that is mechanistically like science, and you can't understand it as for itself, that is, in terms of mental operations.

30
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,080
You've got to understand it in terms of being in the world.

31
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,159
Well, if physiology is the mechanical one.

32
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,800
Then we have to try psychology.

33
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:43,039
And that's what he does next when he turns to the body as an object, the experience of the body in classical psychology.

34
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:57,360
Psychology naturally has to do with the psyche, with the mental, whereas the physiological had to do with the body like a kind of machine with wires and nerves instead of wires, but so forth.

35
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,039
So we're now, then we try to turn, that's where we are now.

36
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:11,919
We're going to switch from empiricist mechanist in itself thinking to intellectualist mentalist for itself.

37
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:19,520
And we're going to discover, of course, no surprise, that that's going to lead us back into being in the world too.

38
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,839
But that's where we are, so I'm going to do that one step by step.

39
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:37,520
And we are then now on page 105 for you who have the what we mostly all have.

40
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,119
And I don't know what pages that is.

41
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,440
What?

42
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,239
90?

43
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:42,959
90.

44
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:43,360
Okay.

45
00:04:43,680 --> 00:05:02,880
Now, what's interesting about this chapter to begin with, and I think sort of annoying to us, you all anyway, because you don't have the background to care, is that he starts it with a whole analysis of that he gets from Husserl.

46
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,200
And what he's trying to do is not disagree with Husserl.

47
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,999
I mean, all that he says here is right.

48
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,080
It's good phenomenology.

49
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:24,679
But whenever he talks about Husserl, uh he it's uh he always thinks that Husserl has not got to the bottom of it and uh he also thinks that Husserl's made it too mental.

50
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:27,560
Just occurs to me that this is an interesting symmetry.

51
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:34,919
Whenever he talks about the De Stales psychologists, he thinks they've got something important, but they haven't gotten to the bottom of it.

52
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:41,159
And they've made it too naturalized, too physical.

53
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:53,080
And always the answer is no, they've not gotten to being in the world, which is the really basic way of understanding us and our relation to reality.

54
00:05:53,080 --> 00:06:23,560
So what happens here is you just get a kind of summary, starting on 103, of the interesting things that Husserl said about the body, that you can't get it in front of you like an object, that you can take you can you it's it's something that's sort of on on the side of the subject and not on the side of the world and you can take things over onto the side of the subject if you make them instruments and the body can do that.

55
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,440
And let's see what else here.

56
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:45,080
Well, it gets interesting really, I think, on 105 at the bottom, when he puts it in strictly Husterian terms, what prevents it, that's the body, ever being an object, ever being completely constituted.

57
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:52,039
That means something that we can be conscious of all the parts and then synthesize them, put them together.

58
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:55,599
That what what the body can't be like that.

59
00:06:56,799 --> 00:07:17,440
And then he goes on and talks about the special way that the body is never just an object, but it's also, and you can, when you feel one hand with the other, the hand that you're feeling is like an object, it's skin and bones, but the other hand is something like your transparent access to that hand.

60
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,359
And that's the body that he's interested in.

61
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,719
Not the physical body, but what he calls la cois in French.

62
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,879
I guess that gets translated the lived body.

63
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,520
Is that what it gets?

64
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,520
I don't, I'm not sure.

65
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,800
We come across it a lot in French, and I never thought to look.

66
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,399
It's a good thing to look at.

67
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:43,119
I wonder, it's very important because what we're talking about is always what I say to myself, the lived body.

68
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,839
There's the body as an object, which is, and that's the body as an object.

69
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:52,400
In German, there's a word for it, it's a herbberg.

70
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:57,680
And then there's the body as you are it and experiencing it.

71
00:07:57,679 --> 00:07:59,600
In German, they've got a different word for that.

72
00:07:59,599 --> 00:07:59,999
Why?

73
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,200
But we've only got one word.

74
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,000
Body.

75
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:03,839
It's your own body.

76
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,719
Okay.

77
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:09,279
So you're so, and it's your own body that we're talking about.

78
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:15,919
And he says how your own body is this access to things.

79
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,160
But how he describes the access to things is interesting.

80
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:44,720
And he's in a husseral frame of mind, I think, when he describes the body at the top of 106 as the presence, at the very top of 106, the presence and absence of external objects are only variations with a field of primordial presence, a perceptual domain over which my body exercises power.

81
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:57,000
Now, I think, and I'm going to show you quite a few passages, he doesn't think that the body is a field of primordial presence.

82
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,120
That's Husserl.

83
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,959
Husserl is still, in the jargon of sort of Deridian stuff, in the metaphysics of presence.

84
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:11,560
And Husserl thinks that what's ultimately present is temporal, the stream of time in consciousness.

85
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:18,120
And Merle-Ponty and Heidegger both think that there's something more important than what's present.

86
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,240
It's something that's more or less absent.

87
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,000
It's the background.

88
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,360
It's what's, in Heidegger, what necessarily withdraws in order for us to experience anything.

89
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:39,079
And I think you'll see that when he starts, you can tell when Merle-Ponty has switched over to speaking in his own voice instead of Husserl's.

90
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:42,760
He'll stop speaking of the body as any kind of presence.

91
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:51,159
And he'll start speaking of the body in very clear language, as having a very special kind of absence all the time.

92
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,440
Sort of gets out of the way, so to speak, so that you can be open, that whatever you're open to.

93
00:09:56,439 --> 00:09:58,679
But let me go through this step by step.

94
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:02,920
So it's a field of presence, he says, on 106.

95
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:12,039
And I think that's, I mean, I think that's all part of, that's not wrong, that it's something that we haven't gotten to the bottom of it.

96
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:15,560
And if you had, you wouldn't describe it that way.

97
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:20,520
You would just you and and you'll see when we get there that how he would describe it.

98
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:34,800
So it looks like we go beyond Husserl in 107 to it was also said, and that turns out to be more of classical psychology.

99
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:43,760
And the classical psychology talked about kinesthetic sensations, he says, that is these body sensations that we have.

100
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:51,920
And these are sensations of our movements and initiate movements on 108.

101
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,079
There's something here which is close to getting it right, that psychology gets.

102
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,600
It's a funny chapter.

103
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,840
Psychology gets it almost right.

104
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:13,200
Then psychology turns it into something too objective and too mechanical, even, or, well, not mechanical, but describes it all in terms of mental representations.

105
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:19,520
And then phenomenology comes along and gets Husserl and gets it almost right again.

106
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,880
That's what seems to be the way this chapter goes.

107
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:30,320
Because here these people who are them, whoever they are that he doesn't name, gets it pretty right at the top of 108.

108
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:35,839
I move external objects with the aid of my body, which takes hold of them in one place and shifts them to another.

109
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,000
But my body itself, I move directly.

110
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,800
I do not find it at one point and transfer it to another.

111
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:42,240
I have no need to look for it.

112
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,600
It's already with me.

113
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,640
I do not need to lead it toward the movement's completion.

114
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,120
It's in contact with it from the start and propels itself toward the end.

115
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,000
That's very close to Mariel Ponty.

116
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,720
That's how my hand is at the doorknob when I get up to start leaving the room.

117
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,000
And it's got the same talk.

118
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,039
The relation between my decision and my body, you know, it's a different issue.

119
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:06,640
It's interesting.

120
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,000
Every once in a while, he says things are magical.

121
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,920
I've got to tell you about that.

122
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:24,520
You've got to figure out on your own whether saying that something's magical is saying that it's being thought about in the wrong way, such that you couldn't ever make sense of it.

123
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,920
That's what this is an insulting kind of magical.

124
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:29,160
That's what he's kept saying here, I'm pretty sure.

125
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:42,040
And I'll tell you how, and then magical sometimes means like the way my hand is at the doorknob when I start, and that nobody's got a brain story about that or a mind story about that.

126
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:47,720
The only thing you can say about that is that's the way we are engaged in hoping.

127
00:12:47,720 --> 00:13:03,720
And then he will say that, and I'll show you some of those, that it's magical, where magical means he can't understand and nobody's got even the right way to describe it, but it happens.

128
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:12,600
Here, it's saying really the way they think about it, they think about something which doesn't really happen.

129
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,680
And what doesn't really happen?

130
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:26,040
Well, it's that the relation between my decision and my body are, in a movement, magical ones.

131
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:31,000
Now, I think that means that it's an anti-Searle point.

132
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:39,640
I think that that means that your intention in action, to talk like Searle, causes you to have a bodily movement.

133
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:55,640
But how something that's mental, in his, in Marawati language, the for itself, the cogito, could cause something else that's in the physical world and is mechanical to happen.

134
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,520
This whole question of mental causality, he doesn't think makes sense.

135
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:14,080
He thinks that if you get this problem, and it's an insoluble problem, because you start with the decision to act, which is purely mental, and the bodily movement, which is purely physical, and then there's no way to get them together.

136
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:20,320
Later, I don't I wasn't going to mention this yet, so I don't think I can flip through it, but you watch for it.

137
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:35,840
There comes a long footnote in which it says he's writing a paper about Searle, in which he says there's a line where Searle says that the intention action reaches down and governs the bodily movement.

138
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:44,560
And there's a long footnote in here where Merlot Conte cites somebody else who says something just like that and then proceeds to say, I have no idea what you're talking about.

139
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:47,200
I don't know what kind of causality is that.

140
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:54,640
How could this intention mean, how could this mental thing, what would it even be for it to reach down and govern the bodily movements?

141
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:03,279
So I think in that sense, it it's magical, meaning incomprehensible, and I'm pretty sure that's what he's up to here.

142
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:03,600
Yeah.

143
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:08,000
I think it's a quote from Sach on in the espresso theory of emotions.

144
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:14,000
Yes, magic, the way Sach characterizes what you should when you're being emotional.

145
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,440
Well, Sant uses magic too, but not in this particular prediction.

146
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:25,600
Well, the thing is here, I think here that he uses the Starting sense magic, meaning that you can have an influence on or be influenced by.

147
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:34,320
Maybe, but what I've got struck by is the relation between my decision of my body.

148
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,919
You can't explain how.

149
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:36,720
That's right.

150
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,719
Well, at least you can't explain how.

151
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,200
Right.

152
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,880
Now, I rest, I don't, I won't settle this now.

153
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,200
I leave it to you, or I will tell you next time.

154
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:54,919
I'll bring you a footnote where I think he says that that issue isn't unexplainable, it's unintelligible.

155
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:55,959
I mean, that's the question.

156
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:09,320
I mean, is it something, is it magical because we've got the phenomena correctly described, but we don't know how to explain it.

157
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:15,800
Or does magical mean you've got the phenomena incorrectly described, so you can't hope to explain it.

158
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:29,880
And I believe, and I don't know what this passage says, but I will find you the footnote next time, where he says that the idea that a decision to act could cause a bodily movement is unintelligible from his point of view.

159
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,800
And that makes sense to me, anyway.

160
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:43,240
I mean, he wants to say that there's always got to be a much more fundamental way that I'm in touch with my body and always already able to respond to affordances.

161
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:51,720
And then, but before you can, have intentions in action that cause bodily movements.

162
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,039
And what?

163
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,279
Wait to get the footnote.

164
00:16:56,359 --> 00:16:57,560
I wasn't going to talk about it yet.

165
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,799
But it's an interesting possible paper topic.

166
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:08,680
I mean, I'm not going to settle it or even resolve anybody who wants to worry about Searle's views of action compared to Marilyn Ponty's views of action.

167
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,399
I may have said prematurely, maybe Olivier's right, there is a problem here.

168
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,319
Let me go back to where I was.

169
00:17:15,639 --> 00:17:19,319
So we're now in classical psychology in 108.

170
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:32,160
And what he does is he says they get more and more, well, first they try to relate the body phenomena to our consciousness of the body phenomena.

171
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:34,480
That's the next stage in the middle of 108.

172
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,880
For the living subject, his own body might well be different from all external objects.

173
00:17:38,879 --> 00:17:50,240
The fact remains before the unsituated thought of the psychologist, the experience of the living subject becomes itself an object, far from requiring a fresh definition of being.

174
00:17:50,559 --> 00:18:01,199
That means you start studying the experience of being a living subject with a living body.

175
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,520
And then, then that's not Husserl.

176
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:10,480
And it's close to what I said Gerbig said, that you always trace it back to whatever you know about the body.

177
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,119
It's got to be an object or some sort of consciousness.

178
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,720
But he isn't claiming here that it's anybody's phenomenology.

179
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,599
He's claiming that this is what psychologists do.

180
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:33,760
And then on 109, they trace my whole experience of my body back to my content of conscious, the content of my consciousness of the body, in a way that the body then looks like you've got a representation of it.

181
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,959
And then at the top of 110, here's magical again.

182
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,359
I wonder which way it's going to go with Olivier's feeling for it or mine.

183
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:52,799
At the bottom of 109, for whereas neither the physicist nor the chemist are the objects of their own investigation, the psychologist was himself in the nature of the case, the fact which exercised him.

184
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:59,359
His representation of the body, this magical experience which he approached in a detached frame of mind, was himself.

185
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:02,079
He lived in while he thought about it.

186
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,879
That turns out to be what?

187
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,720
Bacon?

188
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:22,439
Yes, the psychologist tries to have a detached inventory of the content of consciousness that gives us our experience of the body.

189
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:26,200
And Merlop D wants to say that that's not right.

190
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:33,240
The psychologist basically is engaged in the world and is moving his body.

191
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:42,839
You have totally distorted it and lost the phenomenon if you're looking to see the representations of the body in the mind.

192
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:48,360
And that's and then this gets finally saved.

193
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,080
I mean, I guess.

194
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:57,240
All of us remember is how somehow classical psychology is supposed to be God gets itself over to having to talk about being in the world.

195
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:08,600
So the next move, but beyond that move, of turning it all into consciousness, into the psyche of the psychologist, is to do, I think, Husserl.

196
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,839
This is the bottom of 110.

197
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:19,160
The de facto psyche with its peculiarities was no longer an event in objective time and in the eternal world.

198
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,039
See, we're making a transcendental move now.

199
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:27,319
Where psychology, where does he say psychology outruns itself?

200
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:36,359
That's what Husserl claimed, that you could start with psychology if you did it conscientiously, you'd end up in phenomenology.

201
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,719
The beginning of a parody.

202
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,440
Anyway, we now, I don't know.

203
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,319
But we're about to see psychology outrun itself.

204
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:44,760
I'll read what happens here.

205
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:51,159
But I don't want to spend very long on it because you don't know the Husserl anyway, but you've got to know what he's doing here.

206
00:20:51,160 --> 00:21:14,959
The de facto psyche in objective time with its peculiarity was no longer an event in objective time in the external world, but an event that we were an internal contact, of which we were ourselves the ceaseless accomplishment or upsurge, and which continually gathered itself within itself, its past, its body, and its world.

207
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:23,839
Before being an objective fact, the union of body, of soul, and body has to be then a possibility of consciousness itself.

208
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:34,720
And the question arose to what the perceiving subject, as to what the perceiving subject is, if he is able to experience, able to experience a body as his own.

209
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,159
That, I think, is the Gervich-Husserl move.

210
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:50,959
That sort of giving, says that there's some primordial kind of consciousness of the body, which is rock-bottomed and explains all the rest.

211
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:57,680
And now I think he's going to switch it around and turn it into Heidegger at the top of 111.

212
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:07,520
There was no longer a fact passively submitted to, that one assumed to be a consciousness, or rather to be an experience.

213
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,240
And that's a big switch already.

214
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:18,240
It is to hold inner communion with the world, the body, and other people, to be with them instead of being beside them.

215
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:30,879
To concern oneself with psychology is necessarily to encounter beneath objective thought, which moves among animated things, a first opening upon things without which there would be no objective knowledge.

216
00:22:30,879 --> 00:22:49,240
Now, I don't know whether he, my hunch is that he thinks that's Heidegger, not Merlot Funting, that it leaves, sorry, that's Heidegger Husserl, that's Heidegger not Husserl, that it leaves the talk about consciousness behind and understands us as Dasean, just openness to the world.

217
00:22:49,799 --> 00:23:14,919
And he thinks, one thing is sure, he thinks that if you do psychology seriously, you end up with not a talk about how there is in the mind some representation of the body, but that we are neither mind nor body first, basically, but openness to the world involved coping, period.

218
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:20,039
And I don't know whether he thinks Husserl, do you think he's going from Husserl to Heidegger there?

219
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:21,240
He's still in Husserl?

220
00:23:21,879 --> 00:23:22,680
I'm not sure.

221
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,279
We can talk about it later, I guess.

222
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,039
He's what?

223
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:26,599
Beyond the.

224
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:27,879
Beyond Husserl.

225
00:23:27,879 --> 00:23:28,599
And Heidegger.

226
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,799
And Heidegger.

227
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:31,159
Really?

228
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,599
Well, let's talk about that later.

229
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,920
I don't think there's anything beyond Heidegger, at least.

230
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:37,319
I don't know what that could be.

231
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:39,000
But you'll have to tell me.

232
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,039
That's exciting.

233
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:40,599
Okay.

234
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,960
So let's see now where we are.

235
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:50,599
So he wants to turn it, he just turned it again into being in the world, but he isn't using that phrase here.

236
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,599
That opening onto things without which there'd be no knowledge, the opening upon things.

237
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:59,720
I think that is another name for being in the world.

238
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:06,839
And so now we get to the fatiality of one's body and motility.

239
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,760
And that's going to be the third mode of being.

240
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,720
It's the usual dialectic in Merlot Hunting.

241
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:16,039
You've got to keep your mind open for it.

242
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:22,359
First there was the physiology story, roughly the empiric empiricist Mechanist story.

243
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:27,559
Then there was the psychology story, which in some way looked like a mentalist story.

244
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:36,560
Both of them couldn't account for the phenomena until they arrived at something like being in the world, which is, as he sometimes calls it, a third kind of being.

245
00:24:36,879 --> 00:24:40,879
It's not a physical body kind of being and it's not a mental kind of being.

246
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:45,919
And that's what this that's what you're supposed to understand when you get to the fatiality of your own body.

247
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:50,799
And he's going to explain how why why that's the way to approach it.

248
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,959
And then he's going to explain why he's going to do it in terms of movement.

249
00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:02,560
Then he's going to explain why he's going to do it in terms of the breakdown of movement, a pathological case, namely Schneider.

250
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,720
But we first let's just start at the beginning.

251
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,400
Well, we're now on and I'm going to finish this today.

252
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,240
I want to well, sorry, finished.

253
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,199
No, I'm not.

254
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,360
But I want to finish the introduction.

255
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:18,480
I want to get into the issues around Schneider, and I can do that.

256
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:26,799
Maybe I should stop for a minute, though, because I've just been talking without anybody raising their hand and saying it and think that's an eerie experience.

257
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,000
Yeah, Rick.

258
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,879
Could you just clarify briefly then what Petrol was saying as it relates to?

259
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:52,559
Okay, well I I'd rather have I I wish Olivia was going to do it, but I I mean as I understand it, Pusterl finally gets to the notion of the experience of temporality as more basic than subject or object, something Pustrol calls passive synthesis.

260
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,240
It's it's passive constitution, he calls it.

261
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,200
Yeah, isn't it isn't it?

262
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,559
It's a kind of constituting, it's a passive kind of difference.

263
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,600
Like if you do James, the stream of consciousness.

264
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:21,639
The only difference is that for Husserl, there's a there's a bottom part of the constit the mental life rather that's self-constituting, you know, because very often quotes are so that at the time that just drags itself back.

265
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:26,680
So it's it's self-organized, self-organizing.

266
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:33,159
Yeah, let's just say it's self-organizing, and that's in Husserl language a kind of constituting.

267
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:40,039
But let's not talk about this, because I think that's, I mean, if we're going to it's going to lose everybody, including me.

268
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,760
What's worrying me is that I don't understand Husserl very well either deal with this.

269
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:45,079
That's right.

270
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:55,480
That he thinks that it is a kind of consciousness where all this gets organized.

271
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,600
And, though it hasn't come up, he thinks it's a kind of presence.

272
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:00,919
He calls it the living streaming presence.

273
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:06,279
Consciousness, when it's doing this most basic job, is present to itself.

274
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:09,799
And Mero-Ponty's going to doubt the presence part.

275
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,879
I said I was going to come to that.

276
00:27:11,879 --> 00:27:14,359
And he's going to doubt the consciousness part, too.

277
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:21,799
He's going to say that neither of those ways of talking gets at what's really basic, which is this kind of open absence.

278
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:23,240
That's what's really basic.

279
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,160
Transcendence to talk like Heidegger.

280
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,720
So what's Haser's understanding of the body then?

281
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,599
The body is...

282
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:34,359
The body is that doesn't come up in this.

283
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,640
I see why you're asking that.

284
00:27:35,639 --> 00:27:38,919
Why did he get to the part?

285
00:27:39,639 --> 00:27:43,479
Well, it did not, you know, the touching and the touch.

286
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,719
And the body, not his modules.

287
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:46,919
He's three levels.

288
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:50,360
But that's, but he's asking, you know, I think that was clear.

289
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:52,200
If it isn't, it's a good thing to repeat it.

290
00:27:52,200 --> 00:28:03,439
This whole phenomenology story of the way the body is incompletely constituted, and it's you either have pure touching or pure touch and all that, that's okay.

291
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:05,039
And that's certainly about the body.

292
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:25,680
But when he gets to this final move, when he gets to this move in which there is, before being an objective fact, the union of the soul and the body had to be then a possibility of consciousness itself, the question arose as to what the perceiving subject is if he's able to experience a body as his own.

293
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,879
Okay, so this is supposed to be a level at which you can experience everything.

294
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:36,080
And finally, the final level, and among it, you will experience the body as you're all about it.

295
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:41,200
But he isn't spelling out Husserl's analysis of how you do that.

296
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:50,559
Okay, and we shouldn't be worrying about it, except that chapter since you read it, I thought I had to go through and at least tell you something about what was going on there.

297
00:28:50,559 --> 00:29:04,320
Well, what's much more interesting and complicated and relevant to understanding things is this next chapter, which we're going to read for the rest of today and next and Thursday and Tuesday and Thursday.

298
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:12,640
I put down on the, I hope I put on the syllabus a long time, yes, four lectures to talk about this motility chapter.

299
00:29:12,639 --> 00:29:15,039
It's so interesting and so hard.

300
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:24,079
But before we go into it at all, I have to make the correction of the translation, which is amazingly misleading.

301
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:31,359
It's consistently consistently misleading, which is already something in its favor, I guess, but it's just plain wrong.

302
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:34,639
And you can see it on page 113.

303
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:37,520
He introduces the notion of body image.

304
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:44,639
That's about 25 lines in to the chapter, The Spatiality of One Dumb Body.

305
00:29:44,639 --> 00:29:50,359
Now, body image is, the French is chemical corporeal.

306
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:56,359
It's the body schema that makes all the difference in the world.

307
00:29:56,359 --> 00:30:14,599
Because people did talk about a body image, and they meant your picture in your mind of your body, like whether you were fat or thin, and whether you, and if you had this kind of body image, you could sort of figure out whether the space you were going to go through was too wide or too narrow for you to go through.

308
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:16,679
But it was always like a picture.

309
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,200
That's why it's a body image.

310
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,559
A picture of your body that you had in your mind.

311
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:24,279
That's exactly what he doesn't want to talk about.

312
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:27,000
He doesn't think that's interesting at all.

313
00:30:27,639 --> 00:30:31,000
And he introduces instead the notion of the body schema.

314
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,919
The body schema is something you never directly experience.

315
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,680
It's not an image.

316
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,599
It's not a description.

317
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:46,199
It's the thing that is so pervasive and hard to talk about in Naropon Teal.

318
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:55,000
It's the way your body organizes the world and itself all at the same time.

319
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:08,520
It's your wonderfully complicated systematic interrelation of all the various aspects of what you can do and what will show up when you do it.

320
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,200
But it's the rest of the book.

321
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,039
I mean, don't expect to find out what the body image is right off.

322
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:20,919
Just remember that the body image is the, oh, and it's outside of consciousness.

323
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:32,399
It's the way your body organizes the world and does it in a way that you don't have to be conscious of at all.

324
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:42,640
The way your eyes solve the problem or manage to see things at a certain distance, for instance, isn't something you think about.

325
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:44,400
Your eyes just do it.

326
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:52,079
But when they do it, they are, in Merlot-Pontywe talking, reaching a kind of equilibrium.

327
00:31:52,079 --> 00:32:02,400
And the body schema is what is constantly organizing things so as to lower attention, reach an equilibrium, get a balance.

328
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,359
These are all the kinds of terms he uses.

329
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:14,399
And the know-how we have that enables us to do that, that's the body schema.

330
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:20,959
And so you do not, I mean, so every time you see an image, you just think body schema or you write body schema.

331
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:23,919
I think it's a good idea just to keep writing it in.

332
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:33,760
But first, see, it would have been okay to use body image the first way to use it, about eight lines down.

333
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,039
That's ambiguous.

334
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:44,480
If he says body image was first understood to be a compendium of bodily experience, well, that is what body image was under.

335
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,639
That was what body image meant.

336
00:32:46,639 --> 00:32:53,520
But what he's trying to say is that that was the bad understanding of what he's trying to call the body schema.

337
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,639
That's how it was first, you could say, misunderstood.

338
00:32:56,639 --> 00:33:02,480
What he's really saying is the body schema was first misunderstood as a body image.

339
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:11,520
And that he just is going to consistently use the term body image because that's body schema because that's what he's talking about.

340
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,760
And so let's read that.

341
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:34,359
So it was body schema was at first, you could put in there miss, although that's not in the French, it was first misunderstood to mean a component, a pendium of our bodily experience capable of giving a commentary and meaning to the internal impressions and the impression of possessing a body at any moment.

342
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:39,319
It was supposed to register for me the positional changes of the parts of my body.

343
00:33:39,319 --> 00:34:08,359
Oh yes, it's not only a picture of my body, that's important, fat or thin, but it's also a picture of where my body is, so that in his example, a woman with a tall feather on her hat, because she has this internal picture of not only sort of where how tall her body is, which includes this feather, but where it is, namely going under a low door, automatically will stoop over.

344
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,960
That's all body image thought.

345
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:20,440
So it registers the positional changes of the parts of my body for each movement of them, the position of each local stimulus, and so forth.

346
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:30,360
And in short, a continual translation into a visual language, see the middle of 113, of the kinesthetic and articular impressions of the moment.

347
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,680
Everything's wrong about that for me.

348
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,400
One, that when your body's functioning well, it doesn't have any kinesthetic impressions.

349
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:44,840
It it becomes completely transparent in in your coping.

350
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:51,800
And you certainly aren't going to turn it into a picture of of your body, which is what image certainly means.

351
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,440
And these guys called it body image.

352
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,920
A or and or they also called it, but I mean, sometimes they called it body schema.

353
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,280
I don't think any of them called it body schema.

354
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,319
I wonder.

355
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,079
Keep your eyes open for that, too.

356
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,559
I don't know whether Merlot Ponty invents the term body schema, does he?

357
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,319
He gets it from some of the people in the footnotes.

358
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:14,799
Where does the first footnote say?

359
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,960
Because these guys that he citing really.

360
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,639
But from Schindler?

361
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:23,599
Schilder?

362
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:24,239
Go ahead.

363
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:25,199
Head?

364
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:30,400
Because when they say body image, they say body image, right?

365
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:31,679
Am I wrong?

366
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:33,520
Or do they say he says body schema?

367
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:34,000
Does he?

368
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:36,400
The Schilder says body image, I guess.

369
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:36,959
Yes.

370
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,359
Okay.

371
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,480
He criticizes men.

372
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,279
Okay, good.

373
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,960
And head has it okay.

374
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,800
So he gets it from head.

375
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,639
And you can see why he's for the body schema.

376
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:47,520
Just keep that in mind.

377
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:52,160
And against the body image, and then just keep fixing the translation.

378
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:53,759
Now let's see where we are.

379
00:35:53,759 --> 00:35:57,680
Oh, by the way, another one that just comes in front of me, the bottom of 115.

380
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,719
Would you, the body image, and again, that would be just nonsense if you said it there.

381
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:06,719
The body schema is finally a way of stating that my body is in the world.

382
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,960
You see where that is right at the bottom?

383
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,359
Four lines, five lines from the bottom of 115.

384
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:19,039
I mean, that's to say the body schema is this organized openness that organizes everything.

385
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,720
And that's the utterly fundamental.

386
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:27,520
The body from Merlot-Ponty just is the body.

387
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,280
I don't see any big difference between them.

388
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:42,000
I mean, to the point where, as I said before, having a front and a back, and up and down, and hands and feet doesn't really play any important role in the phenomenology of perception.

389
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,319
You'd hardly notice.

390
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:52,679
The important thing, the phenomenology of perception is that my body organizes the world in response to the organization of the world.

391
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,599
Remember, it's a physical group.

392
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:58,920
We don't want to make it seem that somehow the body could do it all by itself.

393
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:09,320
The body is the body schema is the way that my activity is always correlative with the order of the world.

394
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:09,879
Yeah.

395
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:18,199
Well, I don't want to spend longer at this to do hungry on the skin, but I thought I understood it, and that increased me.

396
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:18,759
Oh, good.

397
00:37:18,759 --> 00:37:19,480
I mean, good idea.

398
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:20,440
Well, we learned something.

399
00:37:20,759 --> 00:37:27,639
Because what Buddha said is that the body limit is a mental picture of your body.

400
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:28,200
Yeah.

401
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:41,000
Whereas the body schema is the implicit way in which your body makes possible ranges of movement.

402
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:50,840
So, for example, I don't need to consult a body image in order to lower my head to avoid a graph when I'm walking.

403
00:37:50,840 --> 00:38:03,640
I just simply implicitly understand why my body behaves by shape so as to manipulate that shape for more optimal.

404
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,919
But now it sounds like you don't want to say that either.

405
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:11,960
You want to say there's something much more fundamental and inferior.

406
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:17,159
I think that people, I bet head thinks like this.

407
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:22,039
I mean, it's our sense of like the feather on the woman's hat.

408
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:23,719
Who does he attribute that to in the footnotes?

409
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:24,839
Is it somebody else?

410
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,719
I think it is somebody else.

411
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,159
It's head.

412
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:39,759
Okay, so there is this view of the body image, or schema for head, which is the way you implicitly keep track of where your head is and implicitly so forth.

413
00:38:39,759 --> 00:38:44,960
But for Merlot-Ponty, I think it's much more basic, and then we have to find out.

414
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,320
I mean, maybe it isn't.

415
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,879
I mean, I think, because I've just been saying, it does a tremendous job.

416
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,559
It explains everything in the everything that goes on gets explained in terms of the body.

417
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:06,000
If my schema just means body, then it's unclear how having a body schema helps us understand anything about being in body.

418
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,800
Well, I understand how a body image plays a role.

419
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,480
And I sort of thought of it as a not possible.

420
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:15,679
But it implicit all of the degrees of freedom you have.

421
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:19,039
Well, there's the tagy thing.

422
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:23,039
That could be that could be part of it.

423
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:26,879
I mean, again, if you know the answer to this, tell me.

424
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,319
I think it's much broader, though.

425
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:39,759
I think that the perceptual constants finally go back to the body schema than every all the ways we sort of stabilize and organize the perceptual world is a function of the body schema.

426
00:39:39,759 --> 00:39:41,919
Am I reading too many things into it?

427
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,239
I think the body articulates both body schema and body image.

428
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:51,279
Because in the next chapter he talks about sexuality and everything.

429
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,880
And this is theory related to the body image.

430
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,799
Well, you can well imagine why.

431
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,640
I mean, depending on what he's thinking about in sexuality, we'll have to watch that.

432
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:10,480
But the the job of uh organizing perceptual experience, that's not a question of body image.

433
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:12,759
That's the that's the job of the body schema.

434
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:19,639
As always, that he says again That's right, but that's that that could be that could be neutral.

435
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,000
I mean, is the body schema like the world because it's a picture of of of my body and its relation to the world?

436
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,599
It is the structure of interaction.

437
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,960
Okay, well that's good.

438
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,919
Well, that's what I think.

439
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,079
But then it's much more than just keeping track of where my body is.

440
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:36,759
Yes, it does.

441
00:40:36,759 --> 00:40:39,399
Well, that's a special case of it, I I want to say.

442
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,079
That's and and right.

443
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:48,119
And and and then the way somebody had, I guess, first came across it, that he's going to generalize it, Merlopon T.

444
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:51,319
Yes, because for him it's only the postural sense.

445
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:51,559
Right.

446
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:53,480
And for Merlopon T, it's really everything.

447
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,800
I mean, there's nothing else to the body but the body schema, real is for Merloponte.

448
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:12,520
He articulates it with the fact that as Musa saying that there's an there's an affinity here from where all the perspectives then focus on the articulating the body schema and this being the center of possible actions.

449
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,720
That's right.

450
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:14,280
Okay.

451
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:28,439
Being the center of possible actions where actions means things I sort of do as an agent, but it also means centers of all sorts of stuff that I don't do as an agent that I'm not aware of at all, that my body is doing.

452
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,160
That's still body schema work.

453
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:32,919
Okay, I think that's fine.

454
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:40,280
Just bear this all in mind and keep as though as you see him using it, you'll get used to it.

455
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,120
Let's see now.

456
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:47,720
So I'm on one, I've got to catch up.

457
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:53,559
So the body schema, not a picture, not kinesthetic your sensations.

458
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:54,400
Oh, yeah, there's a way.

459
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,319
He goes through three ways of understanding the body schema.

460
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:57,879
Let's do it.

461
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,200
Maybe we'll get it clearer if we actually look.

462
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:04,879
The first one we've already done, it's the visual one.

463
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:08,399
You convert it into a visual language.

464
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,719
It's an actual kind of picture of the body.

465
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:13,120
That's on page 113.

466
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,920
And then now I'm doing my sort of interpreting.

467
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:24,319
And then it looks like there's a Gestalt version of it on 114, which he said it is a Gestalt version.

468
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:27,280
And you'll expect that to be half right and half wrong.

469
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,559
And let's see if it works.

470
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:36,000
On 114, he says about 15 lines down, it is in some way anterior to them.

471
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,479
What?

472
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:58,800
I've got to back up and if way back, if a need was felt to introduce this new word, that's about 10 lines down, that's the body schema, it was in order to make it clear that the spatial and temporal unity, the intersensory, or the sensory motor unity of the body is, so to speak, de jure, de jure, that is necessary.

473
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:05,599
That it is not confined to contents actually and fortuitously associated in the course of our experience.

474
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,360
That would be empiricism.

475
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:12,559
That it is in some way anterior to them and makes their association possible.

476
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:16,960
Well, that's always what being in the world level does.

477
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,039
We are therefore feeling our way towards the second definition of the body image.

478
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:32,319
It is no longer seen as the straightforward result of associations established during experience, but a total awareness of my posture in the intersensory world, a form in the sense of Gestalt's psychology.

479
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,199
Well, good.

480
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:35,919
That's really the aloe version, I think.

481
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:42,480
That is, that's got to do with the sort of actual stance of my actual body.

482
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,240
And that's not wrong.

483
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,799
That's what the Gestaltists had.

484
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,120
Is head of Gestaltist by any chance?

485
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:48,839
No?

486
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:51,799
No, because I don't know who he's thinking of there.

487
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:56,360
Well, he's got a footnote, Conrad, another one on the corporate schema.

488
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,480
Okay.

489
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,360
Now, about that, I want to say, well, what's wrong with this story?

490
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:10,680
Well, it's the typical, I think, objection to the Gestalt people that the body schema is being defined apart from the world.

491
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:23,480
It's being described as something that I'm aware of in my body, in my posture, and we aren't hearing about its role in organizing the world in the second definition.

492
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,480
So we've got to go into the third definition.

493
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:28,520
I don't understand what's wrong with the second.

494
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:29,639
What does he say what's wrong with it?

495
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,559
Well, I think what's wrong with it is, does he say what's wrong with it?

496
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:33,960
Let's see.

497
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,079
I'm saying what's wrong with it because I think it's always the Gestalt mistake, but let's see.

498
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:43,799
But already the second definition is superseded by the analysis of the psychologist.

499
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,360
It's inadequate to say my body is a form.

500
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,039
That is to say a phenomenon in which the totality takes precedence over the part.

501
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:54,760
How is such a phenomenon possible because of form and so forth and so forth?

502
00:44:55,719 --> 00:44:57,079
He's saying what you just said.

503
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,039
He does say it.

504
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:58,759
Where?

505
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:02,039
Read it.

506
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,319
Well, I have a question.

507
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,679
Okay, but tell me where then.

508
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:06,360
It's just before the second foot component.

509
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,960
I was saying that you didn't have it.

510
00:45:08,759 --> 00:45:10,920
Body scheme is dynamic.

511
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,879
Oh, yeah, okay.

512
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:15,879
Psychologists often say that the body scheme at the bottom of 114 is dynamic.

513
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:25,719
Brought down to a precise sense, this term means that my body appears to me as an attitude directed toward a certain existing or possible task.

514
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,639
Yeah, but that's the third version now.

515
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:32,719
He's gone on from the Gestaltists to his existential.

516
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,159
Oh, okay, we're agreeing.

517
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:36,079
Yeah, the Gestaltists got something.

518
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,440
They got the whole defining the elements somehow, but they leave out existence.

519
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,360
That's what's always wrong with the Gestaltists.

520
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:48,640
They don't have the engaged, coping, directedness of the body.

521
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:58,800
They have it in what he calls this economy of energy, that the body is this energy trying to come to equilibrium by itself, so to speak.

522
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:04,079
And he's always got, remember, I've said this, it's very important, he's got a bigger Gestalt than the Gestaltists.

523
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:07,039
It's the body-world combination Gestalt.

524
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:15,440
And then you've got to go on, because the body schema so far is just this holistic body thing.

525
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,960
But now he wants to say it's this directedness toward a certain existing possible task.

526
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,639
And now we're at Merleau-Ponty.

527
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,599
He's put back in his usual existentialist mood.

528
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,839
Remember, this is existential phenomenology.

529
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,239
That's always going to be around.

530
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,400
Okay, those are the three definitions.

531
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:47,440
And he talks about it at length, you know, in an interesting way that's going to become very important in the motility chapter.

532
00:46:47,759 --> 00:46:52,800
He says, well, I'll read this whole thing about 10 line sound in 115.

533
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,919
Well, it's funny.

534
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,399
I guess that's not going to be obvious what it means.

535
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:07,360
But anyway, he wants to say that I know where, and this sounds more like what Alva was saying, I know where my arm, when I hold my pipe, I don't have to think about it.

536
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:16,599
I just got a sense of where my pipe is, and I know where my hand and body are, but I know them in a way that isn't knowing that anything.

537
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:20,359
It's the way that primitive people know their way around in the desert.

538
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,159
And so let me go on.

539
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:25,239
The word here, I'm now in the middle of 115.

540
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,440
Applies to my body.

541
00:47:26,679 --> 00:47:32,840
Applied to my body does not refer to a determinate position in relation to other positions or to external coordinates.

542
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,520
But now comes the interesting thing.

543
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:45,960
The laying down of the first coordinate, the anchoring of the active body in an object, the situation of the body in face of its past.

544
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:47,159
Well, there it is again.

545
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:48,999
The existentialist story.

546
00:47:49,079 --> 00:48:00,680
What you get finally is not just the sense of where your arm is and your pipe is and you're standing and all that, which is not wrong, and that's what had happened.

547
00:48:00,679 --> 00:48:06,599
But you get the existentialist thing, this very important thing that he calls the anchoring of the active body.

548
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:20,120
As I say, that won't become clear until you get to the space, the motility, the motion chapter, but this is motility, but there's a motion in it.

549
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,719
Is it in this chapter?

550
00:48:21,719 --> 00:48:22,920
Maybe it is.

551
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:28,199
Anyway, you'll hear that in order to see movement, that's going to be different.

552
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:29,399
That's in a different chapter.

553
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,400
This is about my moving the body.

554
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:36,039
But in order to see movement, it's important to know where the body is anchored.

555
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:37,159
I'll give you a clue.

556
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:46,919
What he's talking about here is this issue, this thing about whether if you're in a train and the other train next to you starts to move, you think your train is moved.

557
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:59,639
Your body is always anchored somewhere in the sense that it determines that here is and what's moving or not.

558
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:08,559
He says if you're looking through the window of the train at the other people's train trying to read the newspaper over their shoulder or something, then your body is anchored over there.

559
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:11,440
And then you'll see that train that's moving and not yours.

560
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,879
So, and it's interesting.

561
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:18,880
That means that this business of where your body is anchored isn't where your physical body is sitting.

562
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,079
Body again means your capacity for coping.

563
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:30,720
And if your capacity for coping is engaged with the neighbor's newspaper in the other car of the train, that's where your body schema has anchored you.

564
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:36,879
And if you're engaged in the usual paying attention to what's in your car of the train, then that's where you're anchored.

565
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:42,960
And wherever you're anchored, that's what's going to seem to move when there are two movements going on.

566
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,639
So that's going to be important, but that's not important yet.

567
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:48,480
So let me go back to where I am.

568
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,240
The anchoring of the active body in the object.

569
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:58,000
That's like, are you reading your newspaper in your car or over somebody's shoulder in the next?

570
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,800
So the anchor in the object, the situation of the body in the face of its past.

571
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,240
Okay, that's the right meaning of body schema.

572
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:08,719
Now, I have to see what's happening here.

573
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:09,279
I don't know.

574
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,719
But that can't quite be right.

575
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:11,119
Why?

576
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:18,639
Because when you're disengaged sometimes, you don't lose your anchoring your body over a sense of where you are.

577
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:23,920
And then you don't lose a sense of what's up and down or left and right.

578
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:31,679
So rather, you have a sense that was up or down left or right, which you were to use when you are engaged in the past.

579
00:50:31,719 --> 00:50:33,279
It's like, oh, that's certainly not his.

580
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:34,639
That's not his.

581
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:37,440
You're saying that's what he should have said.

582
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,000
Is that right?

583
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,679
Well, I don't think he believes that.

584
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:42,000
I don't see much here that speaks to answer, as you said.

585
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:42,960
No, I don't either.

586
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,599
Not here.

587
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:56,200
But I think that it doesn't fit my field to the position because it suggests that somehow where you are doesn't come back to you from the world enough.

588
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,360
You only know where you are.

589
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:10,600
And your body schema tells you this why you're he thinks active involvement with something.

590
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:14,759
But now I'm trying to think, and you are in a way wherever you're actively involved.

591
00:51:14,759 --> 00:51:18,839
And now Alva raises the question: suppose you're not actively involved.

592
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:22,039
Suppose you're just sitting contemplating or you're in the dark.

593
00:51:22,039 --> 00:51:23,400
And now what?

594
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,799
I'm just going to talk off the top of my head.

595
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,520
My hunch is he's going half as that coin is bag.

596
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:48,520
That's a derivative, privative form of my experience of location and my experience of up and down and right and left that makes that only could be had if you had this engaged experience of up and down in front and back and anchored, which and then you could get somewhere by leaving.

597
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,400
You could, there would be some residue if you left some out.

598
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:52,599
What do you think?

599
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:54,279
Well, I'm going to go back.

600
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,759
No, you go on with that, but I want to go back a step.

601
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,279
Okay, go back a step.

602
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,039
Yeah, I want to understand the training thing.

603
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,520
You're anchored in the train next to you.

604
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:08,759
You get, when the train starts to move, you get a vertical perception of the train actually moving.

605
00:52:08,759 --> 00:52:09,079
That's right.

606
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:13,800
If you're anchored in the train in which you actually are, you'd have an illusion.

607
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,159
Yes, you have an illusion.

608
00:52:15,159 --> 00:52:27,159
You've had this avatar that suddenly your train is pulling out of the station and you get very confused and then you reorient and you realize, no, your train is just sitting there like it was, but it's the train next to you that's moving.

609
00:52:27,159 --> 00:52:29,240
But your first thing is an illusion, yeah.

610
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:30,719
Why?

611
00:52:30,039 --> 00:52:30,360
Why?

612
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,319
Okay, well, good.

613
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:32,799
I don't know.

614
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,520
Let me think.

615
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:39,680
Although, maybe I'm going to have to put this off to the movement chapter, but let me think why.

616
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,559
You're anchored in the train.

617
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,159
You must be why you're moving in the train.

618
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,399
Why do you have this illusion by being anchored in your car?

619
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,919
There is a train, let's just try to think it out.

620
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,160
There is obviously motion.

621
00:52:58,159 --> 00:52:59,440
Something is moving.

622
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:02,320
Either you're moving or the train next to you.

623
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:09,599
Movement and sort of moving is what's a revolving target on this account.

624
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:13,520
Here is where your perceived perception is.

625
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:13,920
That's right.

626
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,440
Here is where you are where you're coping.

627
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:19,120
You have a vertical experience in one and an illusion in the other.

628
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:20,000
Well, here.

629
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,000
Here is where you're coping, and here you are.

630
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:23,440
Here you are.

631
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:28,000
Well, what makes it vertical in the one case is that you're in a moving train.

632
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,119
And what makes it not vertical?

633
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,520
No, no, no, you're not in a moving train.

634
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:31,679
No.

635
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:32,880
Linking over at it.

636
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,319
Then it's not vertical.

637
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,119
Yeah, it is.

638
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:38,880
Because you're seeing it, and it actually is then moving.

639
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:44,480
But when you're in the train, and then you get the illusion that the train you're actually in.

640
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:46,639
Well, let me try to figure it out.

641
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:47,039
Now, you're.

642
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:50,480
That's because the visual flow of your window is the same as wood moving.

643
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:57,920
So you don't have any violent sensation of movement.

644
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,599
Which is why it's actually drop it tough.

645
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:04,039
It's not really but you go out.

646
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:05,279
That just sort of wakes you up.

647
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,119
It makes you reor rethink.

648
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,880
Because there's sort of a distributor attack.

649
00:54:09,239 --> 00:54:15,719
My my question then is more of a strut is that the body I'm I'm bringing it back to the body schema, that anchoring of it here.

650
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,240
There's right.

651
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:20,279
Um because then you experience the movement and sort of readjust.

652
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:25,559
I understand why you have an illusion you don't or the other, but here we're talking about what the body seems like.

653
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:29,880
I think it's this simple, but I let me try and if you maybe it'll collapse.

654
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:42,120
That there is something's moving and you are assuming that whatever's happening is happening where you're engaged.

655
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:54,199
And if you're engaged in doing something in this car of the train and the the the visual stuff is exactly like something is moving, you assume that it's moving.

656
00:54:54,199 --> 00:54:55,880
You don't even consciously assume it.

657
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:03,559
You just it's there's movement going on and this is where it must be going on because this is where my engaged activity is going on.

658
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:04,840
Everything is going on.

659
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:12,840
And if you then put your attention into the other car, then you get the you now and there's still something moving.

660
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,679
And now you say something's moving.

661
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:17,640
It's where the interest in where my interest is anchored.

662
00:55:17,639 --> 00:55:19,320
And I'm anchored in the other car.

663
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,079
The other car must be moving.

664
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:29,480
Now, then to find out objectively what's going on, you have to sort of get yourself out of all this and take account of other stuff.

665
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,520
So then you do have uh the analytic perception you pull out.

666
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:33,159
That's right, good.

667
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:33,639
Okay, good.

668
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:34,359
That's it.

669
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:43,719
You pull out and you look at like whether you feel the bounces of the train, or what you really look at is whether the the the markers in the train station are moving.

670
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:48,360
And you say, Aha, it's not me, we're not moving, they're just a staying right outside the window.

671
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,719
Okay, well that was helpful.

672
00:55:49,719 --> 00:55:53,480
And you'll that'll help you when you get to the movie chapter, if you ever make it that far.

673
00:55:54,039 --> 00:55:55,960
One very brief comment on the other point.

674
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:59,159
Yeah, very brief, which is that maybe you're right.

675
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:11,280
I think the way you're reading it, but there's at least another contrast going on in the very same passages, which is between discursive and non-discursive ways of ignoring where you are.

676
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:16,879
And that's that seems to be the most intensive thing.

677
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:22,000
So he says, I know immediately the position of my hand.

678
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:26,399
It's not determined discursively by the angle which it makes is my forearm.

679
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,759
And my forearm is my upper arm.

680
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:30,239
And my upper arm is my front, and my front is my ground.

681
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,960
I know immediately where my pipe is.

682
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:44,159
And he says, as crude as man, if he doesn't stage his variance immediately, I would have to pass the point back and add up this thing to his covered and BA and D, and R.

683
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:58,880
So when he wants to be able to say, so there's a freedom of access to your ability to use the word here, that does not refer to any kind of kind of subpendum we calculate, I refer to a determinant that's right, position.

684
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,160
That's true.

685
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,919
And he doesn't go back on that.

686
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,400
And that's that's we do that.

687
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,640
And when you get to Schneider, we see that even Schneider can do that.

688
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:18,800
But there's something more basic that we do, and that's this business of anchoring where we are in by way of our involvement.

689
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,840
That's why I was emphasizing that.

690
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,320
It's the body schema.

691
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:31,119
If it's a question of whether what the there's two things the body schema can do and you're doing talking about one of them and I'm talking about one of them.

692
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:43,280
One of them is whether you're involved or not, you can have a sense of where your body is and where the parts of your body are without having to think about them or pick them out or experiencing them.

693
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,520
And that's done by the body schema.

694
00:57:45,719 --> 00:57:59,720
Then there is the being in the world, what opens the world to you and organizes it for you, and that's done by the body schema too, in its coping role.

695
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,199
And so that's all right.

696
00:58:02,199 --> 00:58:04,840
I mean, you've got to have both of them.

697
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:25,640
I think there's some kind of claim going to come up with Schneider that the being in the world function of the body schema, yeah, this is surely right, has to be more basic than knowing where your parts of your body are use of the body schema, because Schneider knows where the parts of his body are.

698
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:29,320
He can grasp them, but he can't point at them.

699
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:32,199
And he can ask his nose, but he can't point at his nose.

700
00:58:32,199 --> 00:58:37,720
He can swat a mosquito, but he can't tell where you're pointing if you haven't touched him there.

701
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:49,319
That's because he's lacking the involved coping time use of the body schema.

702
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,199
Let me see if I can put those pieces together because I doubt.

703
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:53,079
Let's see.

704
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,960
No, I can't explain it yet.

705
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:03,399
To refresh to the speciality of situation, what we talked about on page 115.

706
00:59:04,759 --> 00:59:05,960
What I'm trying to think?

707
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:08,520
Okay, where am I trying to, where is it?

708
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:11,960
Speciality of position and speciality of situation.

709
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:16,880
Ah, that's not right.

710
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,279
Is that on 115?

711
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,960
115 in the function?

712
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,480
No, this one's not the same.

713
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,039
Page 115 of Eurovision?

714
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,319
And italic.

715
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:26,119
They's staring right in 115 and I'm not seeing it.

716
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:27,559
But I'm glad to hear it.

717
00:59:27,559 --> 00:59:29,640
Why don't I just read it and see what happens?

718
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:36,559
So it's this anchoring thing, but let's go on.

719
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:43,759
Body space can be distinguished from external space and envelops its parts instead of spreading them out because it is.

720
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:46,159
There's so many things to say that are at once now.

721
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:49,840
The darkness needed in the theater to show up the performance.

722
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,320
Notice I have to stop and comment on that.

723
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,680
I won't forget where we are.

724
00:59:53,679 --> 00:59:57,279
But that's just the opposite of the presence story.

725
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:01,039
I said, finally, the body scheme is going to turn out to be what's not present.

726
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:08,160
The darkness in the theater, the absence of any experience, which opens you up to all the other experiences.

727
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:09,520
That's starting there.

728
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,120
And this will come up again and again.

729
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:23,360
In the theater, the background of some novia, some condolescence or reserve, a vague power against which the gesture and its aim stand out.

730
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:26,159
Now comes the whopper, the zone of not being.

731
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,320
That's as far as you can get from pure presence, I think.

732
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:36,160
The zone of not being in front of which precise beings, figures, and points can come to light.

733
01:00:36,159 --> 01:00:45,839
In the last analysis, if my body can be a form and if there can be in front of it important figures against different backgrounds, this occurs in virtue of its being polarized by its tasks.

734
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:53,680
You see, there we are again, of its existence towards them, of its collecting together of itself in its pursuit of its aims.

735
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:00,079
The body schema is finally a way of stating that my body is in the world.

736
01:01:00,639 --> 01:01:01,679
That's the move.

737
01:01:01,679 --> 01:01:03,839
I'm sitting there somehow, sitting there in the dark.

738
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:21,320
It's a perfectly good objection or counterexample, or sitting there and contemplating, has got to be, on this story, though I don't know what the argument is, a privative form of the body schema as involved, anchoring, and coping in the world.

739
01:01:21,639 --> 01:01:29,559
And somehow, when you stop being anchored and involved in coping in the world, you'll still have a residue that you can use to find out where you are.

740
01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:36,600
Just like you can stop being engaged in the train here or the train next door and start being objective about which train is moving.

741
01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:40,440
But it's all, I don't know, does he say it or are he helpful?

742
01:01:40,679 --> 01:01:50,359
He should be saying somewhere that this is more basic than any sense you have directly of the whole of your body and where it is and so forth.

743
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:59,320
It's always two of the same page where I am already?

744
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,279
No, no, no, no.

745
01:02:03,559 --> 01:02:05,720
289 in French.

746
01:02:05,719 --> 01:02:10,119
289 is 250 in Bible, good and long one.

747
01:02:11,159 --> 01:02:11,559
Whoa.

748
01:02:11,719 --> 01:02:12,920
How do you find those things?

749
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:13,960
That's wonderful.

750
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,479
Whatever it is.

751
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,839
But where on Mala?

752
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:19,399
Oh, boy.

753
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:24,039
That's when you've studied, studied a long time.

754
01:02:25,159 --> 01:02:29,319
What matters for the orientation of the spectacle is not my body.

755
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:36,279
The way it's being made as a thing in the objective space, but my money is a system of positive actions.

756
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,039
A virtual body.

757
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:38,920
That's great.

758
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,239
Stop long enough for us to find.

759
01:02:41,239 --> 01:02:42,119
Anybody found this?

760
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:44,280
How many?

761
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,159
Seven thousand.

762
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:45,799
Okay.

763
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,079
What counts for the orientation?

764
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:47,880
I still haven't got it.

765
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,480
I'm bad at this sort of thing.

766
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:50,839
Oh, got it, got it.

767
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:51,079
Okay.

768
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,079
Okay, let me just catch up.

769
01:02:53,079 --> 01:02:54,119
Okay, but a system.

770
01:02:54,119 --> 01:02:55,799
I'll read it from now on, okay?

771
01:02:55,800 --> 01:03:02,879
But a system of possible actions, a virtual body with its phenomenal place defined by its task and situation.

772
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,000
You have the same thing again.

773
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,120
You're absolutely right.

774
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:14,320
I mean, I don't know if it gets answers to Alva sort of how you can still have a sense of space and place and body when you stop it, but let's focus on this.

775
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:32,800
But that's to say that the body schema, that's what it's called, is this system of possible actions which are always defined vis-à-vis some particular engagement and situation.

776
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:34,879
No, no, no.

777
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,119
That's defined by its task and situation.

778
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,480
There's something to be done.

779
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:38,880
What?

780
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:40,320
I don't think the engagement thing is.

781
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,039
Yeah, okay, good.

782
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:44,960
My body is wherever there is something to be done.

783
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:45,440
Right.

784
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:51,119
Which means, you know, in the car next door, if you're reading over somebody's shoulder, that's where your body is.

785
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:54,480
Your body isn't where this physical thing is.

786
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,319
It's whatever you're engaged in coping with.

787
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:02,239
Right.

788
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:04,480
It's enveloped in the bigger what's to be done.

789
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:04,639
Yeah.

790
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:09,200
It wouldn't be experienced in the dark.

791
01:04:09,199 --> 01:04:10,239
In the phantom loom.

792
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,760
I don't understand the question yet.

793
01:04:11,759 --> 01:04:12,720
Say it again.

794
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:17,440
Yeah.

795
01:04:17,759 --> 01:04:20,640
Oh, most when there's nothing to be done.

796
01:04:20,639 --> 01:04:21,520
Aha.

797
01:04:22,639 --> 01:04:23,760
Interesting.

798
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:25,359
So we all agree, let's go back.

799
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:27,839
The phantom is experienced when there's something to be done.

800
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:34,240
When somebody comes in, your friend, and you want to walk and greet them, you have a phantom leg and you get up and fall on your face.

801
01:04:34,239 --> 01:04:39,200
But now, and what about when you're just sitting there and you're not trying to walk anywhere?

802
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:40,480
Is the phantom limb?

803
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,360
Ah, I know the answer from the phenomenon.

804
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:49,399
As long as the floor looks walkable on the abortion story, you've got the phantom limb.

805
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:52,599
And that's already a kind of involvement.

806
01:04:45,360 --> 01:05:03,799
I mean, if you saw the floor as just a black surface, you'd probably still have a phantom limb if you shouldn't.

807
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:04,919
I don't know what to say about that.

808
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:14,920
But as long as you're seeing the floor as soliciting walking on, you're going to have a phantom limb, even if at the moment nobody's come in that's attracting you to walk.

809
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:32,679
Now, the fact that you still have a phantom limb, I bet, when there's, even when you're just contemplating the floor, if you could do that, I think you could, just like a painter trying to look at the colors in it, that's not going to make your phantom limb go away.

810
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:35,239
That would be an amazing cure for phantom limb.

811
01:05:36,039 --> 01:05:56,039
And then I think Mella's going to have, Conte's going to have to bring in habit and background, which are not immediately influenced by the current situation, and they're going to keep the phantom limb in the circuit of existence, to quote like him, even when you're not particularly, when you're not involved in doing anything.

812
01:05:56,039 --> 01:06:00,760
So that goes back to Lova's question, that there is no such thing.

813
01:06:00,759 --> 01:06:01,400
Good, good.

814
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,359
That's very interesting.

815
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:06,119
The two of you are setting up a fascinating problem.

816
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,480
I think it does.

817
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:18,839
I think that's when I said, you're still making me spell out what I mean by that there, well, no, I think you're doing a better job than I was.

818
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,000
You're making me change my mind in a way.

819
01:06:21,159 --> 01:06:24,599
It's to say that I was always uneasy about it.

820
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:40,000
It's always a sleazy move to say, well, there's something left which is a privilege, derivative form of what you had before, and your body location and so forth is just this sort of lesser, abstractor thing.

821
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,680
I didn't feel right about that.

822
01:06:41,679 --> 01:06:59,520
Now, I think what you've got me to say is even when you're sitting there not doing anything, you've got a kind of residual, but it's a different kind now, a concrete, not an abstract, sense of the floor is something you could be walking on, and the door is something you could be going out.

823
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:11,440
The things are still around you, correlated with your body schema, and that's why you still know where you are and what your body is like.

824
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,520
And they don't go away.

825
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:35,360
Now we have to say something like, because they're in the background, not based on what you're consciously paying attention to, and they're habitual, and they therefore, that's a good better answer, give you the possibility of doing this sort of in the dark, still knowing where you are, contemplating, still knowing where you are, on the background of your engagement.

826
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,759
And it had to be coming out on the background of your engagement.

827
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,199
I like it better to say it your way than to say it my way.

828
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:49,600
No, no, I'm saying it because what you're doing is that the sense of where you are is given in terms of the possibilities of what you can do.

829
01:07:50,159 --> 01:07:53,760
Possibilities of what you can do or present whatever you engage in.

830
01:07:53,759 --> 01:07:55,039
Because there are possibilities for that.

831
01:07:55,199 --> 01:07:57,599
Now I don't think, though, that they're just possibilities.

832
01:07:57,599 --> 01:07:58,960
Let's leave that we have everyone possibly.

833
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,400
This is why why he it draws the attention of the privacy of the situation.

834
01:08:06,959 --> 01:08:08,719
I'm looking to the audience that you just do that.

835
01:08:08,879 --> 01:08:10,320
Wait, wait, let me hear that.

836
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:12,319
Okay.

837
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:28,999
So listen, he says, what counts for the orientation of the spectacle now he's talking about the spectacle not me is not my body as it in fact is as a data detector space but as a system of possible actions of virtual bodies with this phenomenal place defined by its past concentration.

838
01:08:28,999 --> 01:08:38,120
So he mentioned past concentration, but not with the specificity that suggests that if he was hungry or if he was whatever, that would be different.

839
01:08:38,919 --> 01:08:39,959
Okay, yeah, Eric.

840
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:53,959
Task directed, yeah.

841
01:08:57,799 --> 01:09:04,520
We go to the both tasks and there's um existing ways.

842
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,599
We also drive the dynamic body.

843
01:09:06,599 --> 01:09:12,440
Yeah, I think another way to put it maybe, I don't know with how much I'm stretching things, you have to sort of see what you think.

844
01:09:12,599 --> 01:09:17,480
I mean, I think it's got if you're sitting alone sort of contemplating, that's a task too.

845
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:18,919
I mean, you don't fall off the chair.

846
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:20,440
What?

847
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,079
Yes, yes.

848
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:27,160
And it it that'll be a task because if you just fell asleep you'd fall off your chair.

849
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:34,119
I mean it's a job to be doing nothing, uh given the way the world is set up with the gravity and all that.

850
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,280
I think that must be important to.

851
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,079
Okay.

852
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:41,959
I guess so.

853
01:09:41,959 --> 01:09:49,799
And but the virtualities we're back to worrying about what Dalv is saying, you know, are the virtualities just other possibilities that you understand?

854
01:09:49,959 --> 01:09:51,599
They are possibilities and you're standing.

855
01:09:51,599 --> 01:09:52,360
One of them.

856
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:52,839
Yes.

857
01:09:55,400 --> 01:10:10,639
But the important thing you've got to bring in is that they're not just possibilities you could understand, but they're possibilities that you are already on the horizon, to talk like him, of the possibilities you're actually activating.

858
01:10:12,559 --> 01:10:13,119
Right, right.

859
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:19,679
But I mean, what I want to stress is, because this issue about possibility, they're not, I think he would say mirror possibilities.

860
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:24,239
They're not possibilities that you just sort of entertain like a mind.

861
01:10:24,639 --> 01:10:25,200
They are...

862
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:26,719
They're concrete.

863
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,559
They're concrete possibilities.

864
01:10:29,999 --> 01:10:37,440
And I want to say, okay, well, and here's how I want you to think about it, or at least here's how I think about it.

865
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:38,480
You may not want to.

866
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:49,039
I mean, that when he says that these other possibilities are on the horizon of the current one, he means that the current one would be experienced differently if it weren't for these other ones.

867
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,159
They're already in there.

868
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,440
That's the crucial thing.

869
01:10:51,440 --> 01:11:01,039
So when he says, for instance, that I'd be experiencing you all and the moon differently if I thought there was a chasm behind me, if I believed it, I mean belief is too weak.

870
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:15,280
But if, I mean, if I if I were in the if I thought I, well thought, I mean somehow, if I got myself into the situation of a chasm behind me, there would be everything would look different.

871
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:32,719
It wouldn't be as if I would have one more idea, one more belief that if I step back, I'm going to fall into a hole, but I would see all you as staring into this chasm and worrying about me falling into the hole, because it would be on the horizon of everything else I saw that there was this chasm behind me.

872
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:34,639
Then that's this virtual part.

873
01:11:34,639 --> 01:11:45,400
So whenever you're experiencing any particular task, a lot of other tasks are there as tasks you could turn to.

874
01:11:44,959 --> 01:11:47,559
And now everything depends on this idea.

875
01:11:47,879 --> 01:11:55,559
And that means that your particular task is looking like it's one in a system of tasks of which you could turn to.

876
01:11:55,559 --> 01:12:00,279
You notice this is the front of the house and back of the house issue again that Alvin and I always have.

877
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:14,759
I mean, this is to say the front of the house, even when you're not going around the back of the house and don't intend to go around the back of the house, don't even care about the back of the house, looks like it looks because it's on the horizon of it, that that's something you could do.

878
01:12:14,759 --> 01:12:20,279
And if you thought you were in front of a facade, then it wouldn't look like that.

879
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:25,639
And that's not just having two different views of what's possible to do.

880
01:12:25,639 --> 01:12:32,679
That's having a different experience right on of something or other as either the front of the house or a facade.

881
01:12:32,679 --> 01:12:34,039
We're back to that again.

882
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:35,480
And this is important.

883
01:12:35,959 --> 01:12:40,839
This conversation has been very important to understand something which I wouldn't have been able to explain.

884
01:12:40,839 --> 01:12:44,520
And now I will be able to explain it, and you'll be able to understand it.

885
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:58,919
When you get to Schneider, I'm just going to tell you, it's very important that Schneider can do the things that we would call responding to affordances.

886
01:12:58,919 --> 01:13:12,520
He can slap a mosquito bite, light his cigarette, when you put the scissors and thread in front of him, he can make the wallets, and it sounds just like when you read it, well, then what's wrong with him?

887
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:23,559
He's got the engaged attitude, and he's full of responsibility to responsiveness to affordances, and yet he lacks something crucial.

888
01:13:23,559 --> 01:13:34,799
And the critical thing he lacks, Maro Ponty says, is that these affordances are not on the background of the world or don't have other possible actions as their horizon.

889
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,839
Or, let's see what other ways Just to talk about me.

890
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:42,319
He's locked into them and so forth.

891
01:13:42,799 --> 01:13:44,400
And I couldn't understand what that meant.

892
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:47,919
That was just words to me this morning, about two hours ago.

893
01:13:47,919 --> 01:13:57,839
But I now see that means that the scissors are going to look different to him because they're not going to have in them that they are in a system of other possible actions.

894
01:13:57,839 --> 01:13:59,360
And that's what he lacks.

895
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:04,240
He lacks, he's got, he's like the Gestaltists.

896
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:25,039
He's got the Gestalt business of responding to affordances, of completing a whole and so forth, but he hasn't got the kind of engaged activity of a whole body schema, engaged with a whole world, which makes this particular engaged activity open to other engaged activities.

897
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:27,360
I think that's the way to think about him.

898
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:32,879
You're going to read now, I'm going to stop in a second, you're going to read now the Schneider part.

899
01:14:32,879 --> 01:14:37,759
It starts, he doesn't say Schneider right away, but I want so you don't know what I'm talking about exactly.

900
01:14:37,759 --> 01:14:40,159
So I better tell you what I'm talking about exactly.

901
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:51,919
As soon as he gets going in this chapter, 118, 118, he says a patient, yeah, 118, a patient, and that's Gail Goldstein's account of Schneider.

902
01:14:51,919 --> 01:14:53,599
And I've got to tell you more, one more thing.

903
01:14:53,599 --> 01:14:55,360
This is a very hard chapter to read.

904
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:58,480
I would have told you this at the end of the hour, because this is the end of the hour.

905
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:07,119
It's a very hard chapter to read once you stop talking about the phenomenon, which is what I wanted to talk about today, and we did a lot, and that's very important.

906
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:22,839
Because the hard part is that he thinks Gail Goldstein have got it half right, just like he thinks Luslim's got it half right, and the Gestaltists have got it half right, and sometimes he's writing within Gel Goldstein's analysis, and sometimes he's telling you what's wrong with it.

907
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:24,679
So keep these words in mind.

908
01:15:24,679 --> 01:15:30,199
When Gel Goldstein are talking, they're always talking about concrete and abstract attitudes.

909
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:40,999
And what's wrong with Schneider is that he lacks the right kinds of concrete that he has he lacks the right kind of concrete and abstract attitude, or he lacks them or something, doesn't matter what.

910
01:15:40,999 --> 01:15:46,360
When Merloponte is talking about Schneider, he's saying, no, that's too superficial.

911
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:48,440
Schneider lacks being in the world.

912
01:15:48,440 --> 01:16:00,119
If you keep that in mind, you could get through this very hard text because it's it's one it's the worst part of the book for not knowing where Meryloponte's agreeing and where he disagree.

913
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:04,440
And the answer is when he's talking about abstract and concrete attitudes, he's half agreeing.

914
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:09,879
He's saying, well, that's sort of you're getting you're getting it almost, but you haven't really got it right.

915
01:16:09,879 --> 01:16:12,759
And then he's going to always come up with his story.

916
01:16:12,759 --> 01:16:13,639
Okay, that'll help.

917
01:16:13,639 --> 01:16:17,639
Okay, we're going to be now in Schneider stuff for all the next several days.

918
01:16:18,999 --> 01:16:22,039
I I didn't have office hours yesterday because of the holiday.
