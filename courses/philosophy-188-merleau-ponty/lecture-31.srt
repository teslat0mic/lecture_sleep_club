1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In the book you've got, on 497, he says clearly he's not an idealist or a realist.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:23,920
And just to get that out of the way, so that that doesn't, I mean, so that that only says that there's a certain kind of realist he isn't and a certain kind of idealist he isn't, and we still have to figure out what in the world he is.

3
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,080
But let's read that at the bottom of 497.

4
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:37,600
We were once concerned, that is, in the structure of comportment, with gaining an understanding of the relationship between consciousness and nature, between the inner and the outer.

5
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:45,840
Or again, the problem was to link the idealist perspective, according to which nothing exists except as an object of consciousness.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,760
He doesn't hold that view.

7
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:52,960
He does not hold the view that nothing exists except as an object of consciousness.

8
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:54,480
He's going to get rid of that.

9
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:05,520
And the realist perspective, according to which consciousness are introduced into the stuff of the objective world and of events in themselves.

10
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,200
Well, that's, I think, means that he doesn't, he's not a reductionist either.

11
00:01:11,241 --> 00:01:21,401
When he says, realist in that way of talking, he means try to explain consciousness in terms of objective events in the objective world.

12
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:44,280
So he's not going to say that everything that exists exists only in so far as we in our consciousness exist and constitute it in some way, a view that one might think would be viscerals, and visceral defenders aren't here to defend visceral today, so I think it is lycerals.

13
00:01:44,280 --> 00:02:04,600
And he's not going to be what lots and lots of people are now, a kind of reductionist who thinks, like John Searle, I believe, that in the end, all there is is finally physical particles batting around, and we've got to explain everything in terms of them, consciousness, meaning, et cetera.

14
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,241
He's not going to be that kind of reductive realist either.

15
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:15,080
Now, what he is is really interesting and complicated.

16
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,000
And so here's my story.

17
00:02:17,801 --> 00:02:23,081
There are going to be four different levels of description.

18
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:30,361
And so the first one is the world as we perceive it.

19
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:37,561
That's this indeterminate perceptual person.

20
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:41,640
That's the world as we perceive it is indeterminate.

21
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:44,041
It's always got horizons.

22
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:48,600
It's always given to me from some perspective.

23
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:55,080
That already, I have a quote for that, but I think I've even read that quote once.

24
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:03,041
And in a way, he holds that that's the richest of all experience.

25
00:03:03,361 --> 00:03:06,881
All whatever there is, that's the richest there is.

26
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:15,840
And perhaps he should have held that that's sort of what is ultimately real.

27
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,361
I wish he had.

28
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:26,320
I mean, I think it would be interesting because we were so close to what Rick calls the rich world ontology.

29
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:44,481
Namely, that the world is very, very rich, and one of the most rich aspects of whatever that being you have to say or something is very rich, and one of the richest takes on it is ours, and we get a lot of the truth of it.

30
00:03:44,481 --> 00:03:46,481
But that isn't what it says.

31
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:47,760
We'll get there.

32
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,080
Yeah, there's one word.

33
00:03:50,721 --> 00:03:51,520
Yeah, that's right.

34
00:03:51,681 --> 00:04:04,880
I think that this world with its objects, which have always got more about them than we can ever fully discover, which have always gotten deterministic, but nonetheless have a structure, and we can explore it.

35
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:10,320
And there are people and bodies and trees and cars and desks and all that.

36
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:19,681
I wish he had just said that's what's ultimately real, period, and then gone on to just to talk about that he doesn't say that.

37
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:30,961
He does think that it's there is this perceiving that we do, and then he perceives everything from a perspective.

38
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:43,000
Maybe I will read that because that's sort of as far as he goes towards this endeavor realism of rich world of realism.

39
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,560
So that's, I don't think you need to even find it, but I read it once before.

40
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,520
The world is the field of experience, and we are nothing but a view on the world.

41
00:04:56,841 --> 00:05:01,880
That's 406 is the middle of the page.

42
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:03,320
472.

43
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,640
Okay, on 472 here.

44
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,960
That can tell you where it is on the page.

45
00:05:07,961 --> 00:05:10,761
That's about 15 lines from the bottom of Forest.

46
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:13,001
But then, I mean, that's just where you start.

47
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,041
But things get much more complicated.

48
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:25,401
Then, well, then there is our perceiving, our view on the world, always perspectival and unfinished and open.

49
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:30,840
And then number two is there is the perceptual world.

50
00:05:30,841 --> 00:05:34,760
That's different than the world as we perceive it.

51
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:41,161
That's the shared world on which I've got a perspective and you've got a perspective.

52
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:45,880
And that world has inexhaustible details.

53
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,600
And then, you know, in your book, you'll still 451.

54
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,641
Now, 451 in this book.

55
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,000
In this one.

56
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:08,600
Yeah, I mean, the reason you'll see, I'm assuming things broke down and I couldn't have time to do all the copying, but right here at the beginning, I was still able to look in here.

57
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:18,801
So on 451, which is the end of a paragraph, the last 15 lines of a paragraph where you say there's a where it begins, our body.

58
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:23,320
It gets to go 15 lines before that paragraph.

59
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,721
451 on in the old ones.

60
00:06:25,721 --> 00:06:26,041
No, sorry.

61
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,401
451 in the in sorry, in in ours.

62
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,241
And now Halv is looking for it.

63
00:06:30,241 --> 00:06:31,040
Well, I'm going to go on.

64
00:06:27,961 --> 00:06:32,081
Yeah.

65
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:36,720
Okay, so I'm going to read those 15 lines on 451 in ours.

66
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,801
I have had the experience of a real triangle.

67
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:56,721
And because as a physical thing, it necessarily has within itself everything that has ever been able, that it has ever been able or ever will be able to display.

68
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:14,720
So now it looks like it's part of the way the physical thing shows up in the perceptual world is that it's experienced at least as having within itself all these determinate characteristics.

69
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:28,880
Then he goes on, unless the perceived thing, see, it's the perceived thing, has for good and ever implanted within us the ideal notion of a being, which is what it is, there would be no phenomenon of being.

70
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:44,640
So there is a, this is very strange, but it looks like there is, in the world that we perceive, we can't help seeing it as having all these characteristics and completely determinate.

71
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,280
It's a good thing he says that, because I swear I do.

72
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,640
I mean, I think the desk has got all of its details completely determinate.

73
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,841
I think it would be wacky to think otherwise, that it somehow gets determinate when you go around and look for it.

74
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,641
None of us want to say that.

75
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,881
But I'm not quite sure of the status of this claim.

76
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:08,160
But it looks like it's the crypto mechanism, which is not a bad thing.

77
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:09,520
I could tell.

78
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:30,521
The crypto mechanism is the way we are led to extrapolate the way the perceptual world is perceived by us, indeterminate, etc., to the way our experience of the world is indeterminate.

79
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:39,401
We extrapolate that to a shared perceptual world of objects which are completely determinate.

80
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:49,801
That gives us our understanding of being, which I think is equivalent to this thing he says every once in a while, the in itself for us.

81
00:08:51,241 --> 00:08:54,441
And we actually experience the in itself.

82
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:08,601
And it's, and that gives us our understanding that there are being, where being means everything is either this has this property or that property, and all of its properties are in.

83
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,601
That's what it is for something to be to have and so forth.

84
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:15,641
We really got that.

85
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:30,760
And but, and now we go on, somehow it's going to turn out that that doesn't obviously capture the next thing, which is the natural world.

86
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:39,721
Because the natural world doesn't have this characteristic of having all its properties in and so forth.

87
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:40,840
Or maybe it does.

88
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:42,200
I mean, I'm telling you what I think.

89
00:09:42,201 --> 00:09:43,481
I can't quite figure out.

90
00:09:43,481 --> 00:09:48,041
Does the natural world, as he's using the term, have meaning?

91
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,441
Well, let's talk about the natural world.

92
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:57,400
The natural world turns out to be absolutely other.

93
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,041
But before we get to that, let me just, it's such a weird thing.

94
00:10:01,121 --> 00:10:02,560
I do want to read you some quotes.

95
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:08,721
And now, Alga, they'll be in your book, because here's where my references for mind give out for a while.

96
00:10:08,721 --> 00:10:13,280
Okay, the first opens up a natural world starting on 24.

97
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:25,121
And it's very important to see that the natural world is not the same as the world dealt with by science.

98
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:25,841
We'll get that.

99
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:28,641
At the bottom of 28 for you, Paul.

100
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:36,721
We have to discover the natural world, too, and its mode of existence, which is not to be confused with that of a scientific object.

101
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,721
Okay, so let's find out about that natural world.

102
00:10:40,721 --> 00:10:42,881
So there's lots to be said about it.

103
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,601
For instance, and this is another, this is now 330 in your book, Alva.

104
00:10:48,321 --> 00:10:50,561
About 29 down.

105
00:10:50,561 --> 00:10:53,601
330, 385.

106
00:10:53,601 --> 00:10:56,241
385 in our book.

107
00:10:56,241 --> 00:11:01,601
Okay, that's this mysterious thing which I read about six lines down.

108
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:09,361
The natural world is the horizon of all horizons, the style of all possible styles, which guarantees to my experience a given.

109
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:17,921
Not a willed unity, a given, not a willed unity underlying all the disruptions of my personal life.

110
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:28,081
Its counterpart within me is the given, general, and pre-personal existence of my sensory functions in which we discovered the definition of the body.

111
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,000
That's one of these crucial statements.

112
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,201
So what does it look like?

113
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:41,521
Well, it looks like the natural world is a horizonal thing.

114
00:11:41,841 --> 00:11:45,400
So that would look like it's correlative with my body.

115
00:11:43,121 --> 00:11:48,761
It's got a style and so forth.

116
00:11:49,400 --> 00:12:02,121
Now I sort of sigh because it's hard for me to figure out how to reconcile that with the notion that the natural world is the absolute other.

117
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:13,961
I don't understand how the absolute other has a horizon, but let's read about the absolute other, but that's really very important is not being an idealist.

118
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:19,160
If there's an absolute other, it would seem to be even more absolute than a horizon.

119
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,561
A horizon is always relative to me.

120
00:12:21,561 --> 00:12:23,481
It can't be an absolute other.

121
00:12:23,481 --> 00:12:30,281
I mean, somehow, I hope this is coherent, but I must confess I don't see how to put it all together.

122
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,520
And that's what I want you all to help do as soon as I get laid out here.

123
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,601
Where are we?

124
00:12:37,801 --> 00:12:40,521
I want to look at 432.

125
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:41,961
Yours.

126
00:12:42,121 --> 00:12:43,721
I think that is fine devotion.

127
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,361
Okay.

128
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:51,961
I'm going to go over here also, so I know what I'm talking about over here.

129
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:53,561
432.

130
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:59,641
The paragraph that begins, our replies.

131
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:12,760
And it says, at the bottom of that paragraph that begins, our replies, what is true taking one thing with another, is that there is a nature, which is not that of science, but that which perception presents to me.

132
00:13:13,081 --> 00:13:14,041
Okay.

133
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:20,841
Now, and that's, but how that's supposed to be absolutely other is not clear to me.

134
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,721
Where did you say that?

135
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:22,680
Absolutely other?

136
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,681
Oh, yeah, the absolute other is on 325 of yours.

137
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,041
Didn't I give the code up to ours?

138
00:13:28,321 --> 00:13:29,841
I think that's 379.

139
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:32,401
Okay, then let me find that over here.

140
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,921
Not quite.

141
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,121
Okay, let's see now.

142
00:13:35,121 --> 00:13:35,681
What did I say?

143
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,320
I was, I'm getting 325.

144
00:13:38,321 --> 00:13:40,000
Okay, and that's 379.

145
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,760
Eight lines down there.

146
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,081
Eight lines down on 379.

147
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:44,880
389.

148
00:13:45,121 --> 00:13:45,841
38.

149
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:47,520
Ah, that's why we can't find it.

150
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,561
Okay, yes.

151
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,841
Eight lines, yeah, something like that.

152
00:13:51,841 --> 00:14:00,961
So that we open uh we open ourselves to that is open himself to an absolute other, which he is making ready in the depths of his being.

153
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:02,321
Okay.

154
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,160
Now, that's for the...

155
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:05,681
Are you going to 325?

156
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,160
Okay?

157
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,520
I can't find it on 325.

158
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,081
Okay, let me go to the 33.

159
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,760
Oh, you said two is on 226, actually.

160
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,241
I see.

161
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:12,000
Well, they're there a little confused.

162
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:16,000
But and let's go right on close to that.

163
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,280
It's 328 in yours.

164
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,241
I'll find it in a minute in ours.

165
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:23,841
It says it's 325.

166
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,400
Okay.

167
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,041
Let me go over here.

168
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,681
If anybody finds more about the absolute other.

169
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:40,081
Well, it's not, it's another, it's not neither like a horizon quite, nor like the absolute other.

170
00:14:40,081 --> 00:14:45,201
It's it's on 328 of yours, about 15 lines from the top.

171
00:14:45,201 --> 00:14:47,280
And what did you say it was going to be in mine?

172
00:14:47,601 --> 00:14:49,760
Um 328 is 3.

173
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,241
This is a strange thing here.

174
00:14:52,481 --> 00:14:56,481
Back to the horizons and the styles and so forth, about six lines down.

175
00:14:56,481 --> 00:15:02,000
The style is a certain manner of dealing with situations and skipping down about until 50 lines down.

176
00:15:02,081 --> 00:15:06,481
I experience the unity of the world as I recognize the style.

177
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:09,281
You know, that's not altogether, that's not wrong.

178
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,161
It's not actually in that.

179
00:15:11,721 --> 00:15:13,880
I do not for the moment, I think.

180
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:35,881
But I find this one somewhere, but I do not for the moment doubt that in themselves things have become possible and compossible because for the very short, I'm in communication with one being and one owner, a vast individual from which my own experiences are taken and which presents on the horizon of my life.

181
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,681
You don't find out.

182
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,121
Nobody understands where that is.

183
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,160
What?

184
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,640
In the old one, it's on 328.

185
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,681
Oh, it is.

186
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:43,241
Yeah.

187
00:15:43,961 --> 00:15:44,281
Oh, yeah.

188
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,361
Here it is at the bottom of 382.

189
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:52,761
A vast individual, about six lines from the bottom, exists at the horizon of my life and so forth.

190
00:15:52,760 --> 00:16:08,520
Okay, so I'm just trying to say there's this horizon story, and the world is this ultimate horizon, this individual on the horizon of my life, and somehow it's also absolutely other.

191
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:14,681
It's experienced as independent of human beings, as being completely determinate.

192
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,321
It's experienced as having being in his language.

193
00:16:19,321 --> 00:16:23,240
It's experienced as the in itself for us.

194
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:31,480
Now, you could find that on 293, which is on 341.

195
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,160
Okay, and now I'll tell you where it is on the page.

196
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,280
For you.

197
00:16:36,601 --> 00:16:37,800
Oh, it's a famous one.

198
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:39,001
We've read it before.

199
00:16:39,001 --> 00:16:40,601
I'm just calling your attention to it.

200
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:47,640
It's in the middle of your page 293, and it's here wherever the Place de la Concorde is.

201
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,081
Help me find it.

202
00:16:49,081 --> 00:16:51,640
The paragraph begins in the same way.

203
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,000
Oh, yeah, here we are, the middle of 342.

204
00:16:57,321 --> 00:17:02,480
I walk across the Place de la Concorde and find of myself and so forth and so forth.

205
00:17:04,081 --> 00:17:14,400
And then you see the surface of the stone and the play of lights and entirely without history.

206
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,961
And the greedy circles and so forth.

207
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:22,160
My total perception is not composed of analytic perceptions that capable of dissolving them.

208
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:30,480
My body, through my habits, ensures my insertion into the human world, does so only by projecting me in the first place into the natural world.

209
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:38,560
And now the funny, interesting thing, which can always be discerned underlying the other, as a canvas underlies the picture.

210
00:17:38,561 --> 00:17:55,040
So that's this natural world of being, and it obviously is supposed to be absolutely, and maybe these two jobs are not incompatible.

211
00:17:55,041 --> 00:18:01,121
I mean, it would be there somehow, whether I was around or not.

212
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:04,720
That's the sense in which I think it's absolutely other.

213
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:22,400
But it also shows up in my experience as this ultimate horizon, this greedy surfaces and mountains and stuff, underlying my evaluation and my experiences.

214
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,960
That's what he wants to say.

215
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,400
That the puzzle keeps coming back, and I'm sorry if you're confused, but I'm confused.

216
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:47,000
That the follow-ups are how much of this natural world structure is there independent of us, and how much of the natural world structure is a co-production correlative with our bodily.

217
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,240
He seems to want to say both.

218
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:57,321
There is a natural world independent of us, which is correlative with our bodily capacities to organize it.

219
00:18:57,321 --> 00:18:58,440
Can you make sense of that?

220
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:07,480
I was going to ask a question that seems the way about the crypto mechanism, something that we just can't help seeing the world as it is.

221
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:12,281
The crypto mechanism experiences good.

222
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:15,081
I mean, yeah, that's how there is an in-excel for us.

223
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,081
But that's not the natural world.

224
00:19:17,081 --> 00:19:20,760
That's the way we have to perceive the shared perceptual world.

225
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:25,400
But underlying the shared perceptual world is the natural world.

226
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:39,081
And the question I'm asking is: the perceptual world already, this is what you're saying, has to be experienced as having being, of having determinant properties, even though our way of perceiving it never does.

227
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,920
That's what I said earlier.

228
00:19:40,920 --> 00:20:05,801
But underlying the perceptual world with its determinant properties, which are clearly relative to us, in the sense that we're the ones who see the colors and the shapes and so forth, there is a natural world which is absolutely other and which, and this is the crucial question, it has whatever character it has, presumably, whether we were around or not.

229
00:20:05,801 --> 00:20:09,800
But then, let me say what's cousining so you won't get lost.

230
00:20:10,121 --> 00:20:22,680
The story he thinks there is this nature independent of us, and we have to get in the right relation to it to unlock it so that we can have experience of this perceptual world.

231
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:48,480
The question is, how much structure does he think that nature in itself this absolute other has and how much of its structure that it is a structure disclosed by our activity and how much of this structure is constituted by our bodily way of organizing.

232
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,841
I can't tell.

233
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,560
If you have passages that can, we're going to have to look at.

234
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,680
The constitution issue, I think he clearly says settlement.

235
00:20:56,001 --> 00:21:04,800
Of course, but I mean that's does it that begs the question because what I want to know, because there is a world that's absolutely other, a natural world, and we don't constitute it.

236
00:21:04,801 --> 00:21:08,720
But how much of the structure of that natural world do we constitute?

237
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,000
That is spatial, that is temporal, that is objective with colors and sizes.

238
00:21:14,001 --> 00:21:18,480
I think he thinks that's all relative to us and our body schema.

239
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,640
He says that we're injected into the natural world because of our habit, those needs are still.

240
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,121
And so we're injected into it because of certain capacities we have to encounter it.

241
00:21:27,121 --> 00:21:29,920
And that's the sort of unlock it thing.

242
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,001
But the question, I'll give you quotes.

243
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:53,040
I mean, I wish he would say, and I tried to say this and make up an evolutionary kind of story, that there really is a world of the kind of space and time we experience, and that's independent of us, and then we have this capacity in our body to unlock that, to disclose that, and so forth.

244
00:21:53,041 --> 00:22:02,880
But I think when the tips are down, he thinks that all the structure of the natural world is contributed by our body schema.

245
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:08,480
We could quotes, which would leave the natural world there as boundary conditions.

246
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,240
That is, we can't just organize it any old way.

247
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,841
That's the truth that you're asking, Asher.

248
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:28,040
And the fact that we can't just organize it any old way, however, doesn't say that we find a structure, and it's this, this very world of perception.

249
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:40,520
This natural world, which is absolutely other, set conditions such that one of the ways it can be organized is by our body thema.

250
00:22:40,841 --> 00:22:43,801
But that's not its structure.

251
00:22:43,801 --> 00:22:47,081
That's one of the ways that it can be organized, is the way I read it.

252
00:22:47,081 --> 00:22:47,800
What do you think?

253
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:49,320
I'm just asking you the question.

254
00:22:49,321 --> 00:22:51,161
What do you mean by structure of the world?

255
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,560
Do you mean a structure that can be articulated?

256
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:54,920
Oh, no, no, no.

257
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,121
I haven't got to be able to step down the line.

258
00:22:58,121 --> 00:22:59,240
This is the natural world.

259
00:22:59,321 --> 00:23:02,040
He says specifically, it's not the world that science studies.

260
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,681
Well, not explanatory.

261
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:11,400
No, the natural world can only be hymatized by making sense of it as perceptual objects.

262
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:23,481
This is the constitution, or sometimes he says the recomposition, I mean, once, of the natural world, as if it had already this structure, and then we have to recompose it and give it this structure.

263
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,680
That's an interesting possible view to hold.

264
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:33,240
But so, I mean, all I can say is it looks sometimes like he thinks it's just boundary conditions.

265
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:40,760
When structure, one way of getting to think of it is our bodily way, and that gives us this world.

266
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:51,880
But that's not what's really there, because if there were no human beings, then the boundary conditions wouldn't be sorted into this experience.

267
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,081
That's one thing.

268
00:23:53,081 --> 00:23:59,521
So the boundary conditions that you get in sync with and you compose this world, organize it, and it works.

269
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:20,720
Or the boundary conditions already have a lot of structure, and all you have to do is get that structure, which you happen to be happily in sync with given the body schema, and then you disclose this very world or recompose the way the world really is, the natural world.

270
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:23,841
And I guess those are the two views.

271
00:24:23,841 --> 00:24:32,400
I mean, has it got the structure we find in it, or is it the boundary conditions, the absolute other, that just sets a limit on what you can find?

272
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,200
Yeah, James.

273
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,121
That's what he said.

274
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,520
Good, good, good question.

275
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,521
I'm not sure I believe it.

276
00:24:43,521 --> 00:24:54,720
But the perceptual world is we understand it as full of significance relative to our interests and purposes.

277
00:24:55,041 --> 00:25:14,800
And the natural world, this gritty stone in the philosophical Congo, is sort of like the secondary and primary qualities, only that would be a very bad way of thinking about it because, for instance, shape and size are part of the we disclose.

278
00:25:15,121 --> 00:25:38,960
All that there is is a kind of stony stuff that we can get at when we take it away all of the part of the perceptual world which is historical, cultural, and relative to yeah, social, cultural, and significant.

279
00:25:38,960 --> 00:27:20,321
That you take that away, you get the natural world so the natural world of the size there should be the absolute the one and the sensory world of the size should be possible no no no no I'm sorry no that's not what I meant to say no the the one already has in it significance history fedimented history and culture and the one reveals this world which is full of what what it affords to any kind of but that couldn't be the absolute other so what is the absolute other well the absolute other seems to be what's left if you take away everything that's relevant to history culture meaning and so forth and there's going to still be something there which is what you see in this passage when you see the the where are we then let's read this some more a natural non-human space he's talking about so you walk across the plastic concord you are engaged by a yellow green surface and there's no longer even a stone there that's too much of our interpretation the play of light upon an indefinite substance and this is and this my body projects who through my habits ensures an insertion into the human world and it not only projects me in the first place my total perception isn't not compounded as such analytical perceptions, but capable of dissolving into them.

280
00:27:20,321 --> 00:27:36,400
And my body, which through my habits ensures my insertion into the human world, does so only by projecting me in the first place into the natural world, which can always be discerned underlying the other, as a kind canvas underlies the picture and makes it appear insubstantial.

281
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,720
Let's see if we can get any more.

282
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:48,560
A little toward the bottom of our page, one human spaces present themselves as built on the basis of natural space and so forth.

283
00:27:49,841 --> 00:28:11,841
And maybe the top of 343, about 15 lines down, he's talking about the natural world again in 94, is it is so foreshadowed by the horizons of possible objectification and it frees me from every particular setting only because it ties me to the world of nature or the in itself, which includes them all.

284
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:16,400
Now I saw a hand up.

285
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,081
That's the yeah, Eric.

286
00:28:18,561 --> 00:28:22,800
You didn't sell, did anybody speech about the inner self first?

287
00:28:23,281 --> 00:28:25,200
Is this in itself?

288
00:28:25,361 --> 00:28:26,241
I would have thought so.

289
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:28,240
Okay, I think so.

290
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,720
The in-itself, well, wait a minute, wait a minute.

291
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,601
No.

292
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,121
Well, I don't know.

293
00:28:33,121 --> 00:28:36,480
I'll tell you the two things that I go into my mind.

294
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:49,121
When he talks about the being as this completely determinate, which perception gives us if you extrapolate it, I don't think that's the absolute other.

295
00:28:49,121 --> 00:28:54,481
I think that's the shared perceptual world as completely determinate.

296
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:03,920
This, the very classroom and so forth, that's what you get when you extrapolate all of this to determine it being.

297
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:11,841
But that wouldn't be the natural world, which doesn't have all these properties of being death and and so forth.

298
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,920
That's further underlying.

299
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:36,361
And it's got to be a kind of anti-idealism, just to keep all of my cards on the table, because it has at least got this property of being the boundary condition, some kind of absolute other, which sets a limit on what you can compose it as or organize it.

300
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:43,800
Even if all the organization of it is finally up to us, we just couldn't organize it any old way.

301
00:29:43,801 --> 00:29:49,640
And we can't organize it simply by consciously trying.

302
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:55,321
There's something in us, namely this shared body feeling.

303
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:01,640
And there's something there, independent of us and our bodies feeling.

304
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,241
And you get them together.

305
00:30:03,321 --> 00:30:04,841
That's the natural world.

306
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:15,240
And when you put them together, you get this, namely a perceptual world full of meaning and significance and historical and so forth.

307
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:23,321
And a sense that there's something that underlies it, which I think, I think about which you could probably say nothing.

308
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:28,520
I mean, I don't know how far he gets with his gritty yellow surface and so forth.

309
00:30:28,521 --> 00:30:33,480
I think finally he gets rid of that too, not even a stone and so forth.

310
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:48,361
It's, by the way, like Sardin Nausda, I mean, he starts taking back all the human relative characteristics of the world until you get to the whatever that underlies it all, about which I think he can say nothing finally.

311
00:30:48,361 --> 00:30:48,921
What is it?

312
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:54,520
Finally says, it's not even a stone, but the play of light upon an indefinite substance.

313
00:30:54,521 --> 00:31:12,880
The indefinite substance is this absolute other, is the boundary conditions, is what keeps it from being idealism, because we have to build our perceptual world on the conditions provided by that insubstantial, that indefinite substance.

314
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,241
That's right.

315
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,921
Maybe I should go on to the fourth.

316
00:31:16,561 --> 00:31:18,961
But I'll come back to this one.

317
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,241
This is the hardest one.

318
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:31,361
I can understand that, I think I can understand, as I said, the way we perceive the world, the shared perceptual world, the natural world is the one I don't get.

319
00:31:31,361 --> 00:31:33,520
I'm giving you all the variations.

320
00:31:33,521 --> 00:31:37,121
And now I can go on to the last one, which is the scientific universe.

321
00:31:37,121 --> 00:31:38,081
Can I do that?

322
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:42,000
Well, okay, I was going to offer an account, but I'll do it.

323
00:31:42,081 --> 00:31:44,240
Well, I certainly don't want to leave this.

324
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:55,121
I think an important passage is my book, which is 380, but you're connected with the things about the.

325
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,400
Oh, yeah, okay.

326
00:31:57,121 --> 00:32:08,640
He said a lot of things there that suggests maybe he thinks that in our experience of the pebble as a pebble, there is also almost the experience of it as a kind of play of light.

327
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:17,361
Speaking of the possible equipment, my gaze knows the significance of a certain patch of light in a certain context.

328
00:32:17,361 --> 00:32:26,960
It understands philosophy to light expresses more general terms to the logic of the world to which my body in its environment conforms.

329
00:32:28,321 --> 00:33:02,281
So the point is that, um here's what I propose: that the perceptual world and the natural world are actually the same thing, and that there is some level of sort of indeterminate perceptual degree that requires that through skills, through the skills, which are which are based out of your body, you can make the mere play of mind into something which is intrinsically there and has hidden parts and notes more than you can see, and that's that's the natural world.

330
00:33:02,281 --> 00:33:17,160
So he's also done the natural world underlying, what he says in that other message on 1993, is that the natural world underlies the human world, not exceptional the human world, as of as canvas underlies the picture.

331
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:21,160
But of course, the canvas is well, but only present there's one.

332
00:33:21,401 --> 00:33:23,720
Well, there's a really syndrome.

333
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,721
Well, I don't know about that.

334
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,640
I think maybe that carries out the analogy, Hodge, but I'm not sure.

335
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,761
That's interesting.

336
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,961
We try that in my look on 380.

337
00:33:33,961 --> 00:33:38,041
Let's see what happens to in the light of that.

338
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,481
Let's start at the bottom of 379.

339
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,441
I just want you to not make a mistake.

340
00:33:44,441 --> 00:33:55,081
Yet we reject the idealism involved in the synthetic view because it just it because it too distorts our lived through relationships to things.

341
00:33:55,081 --> 00:34:07,001
Insofar as the perceiving subject synthesizes the percept, he has to dominate and grasp it through a material perception to organize and lead together from the inside the aspects of the thing.

342
00:34:07,001 --> 00:34:09,081
That means that perception ceases.

343
00:34:09,081 --> 00:34:13,320
This is his view now, to be inherent in the individual subject and so forth.

344
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,640
And the thing loses its transparency.

345
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,200
And this is how he's not an idealist.

346
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,561
You have to be.

347
00:34:19,561 --> 00:34:21,401
And now skipping a little.

348
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:32,080
The perceiving subject must, without relinquishing his place and his point of view, and in the opacity of sensation, reach out towards things to which he has in advance no key.

349
00:34:32,401 --> 00:34:51,601
If anything, he sort of has the key to unlock it, but he doesn't have it in consciously or anything, but it's in the body schema, I think, for which he nevertheless carries within himself a project and open himself to the absolute other, which he is making ready in the depths of his being.

350
00:34:51,840 --> 00:35:10,801
That is, he's alerting the body schema, which is the way the anyone, the impersonal organization in him, is going to take up this and organize the world.

351
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:13,440
Now, let me see if I can help connect with Albert.

352
00:35:14,881 --> 00:35:23,921
So you perceive a pebble and you understand all of its sort of perceptual properties when you do that.

353
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:25,121
Let's go to the bottom.

354
00:35:25,121 --> 00:35:31,760
Expressed in more general terms, there is a logic of the world to which my body in its entirety conforms.

355
00:35:32,401 --> 00:35:34,400
I take it that must be the natural world.

356
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,160
Is that what one would think?

357
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:38,400
I mean, that's the thing you're unlocking.

358
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:44,081
But the moral I'm seeing from this is that there isn't isn't natural and the perceptual world understanding.

359
00:35:44,081 --> 00:35:45,760
And I I'm not concerned.

360
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:56,241
So th that's that's that's probably what I think as thanks to I know if you tension the natural world and the perspective of the world are the same.

361
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,121
Well, let me go on.

362
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:59,680
I I mean if that would solve it, that would be great.

363
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:23,801
There is a logic of the something world, whether they whether whichever it is or or the same, which my body conforms and through which things of interior significance become possible for us, insofar as it is capable of synergy, my body knows the significance of the totality of my experience of this or that color added or subtracted and so forth and so forth.

364
00:36:24,521 --> 00:36:36,041
To have a body that has a universal setting, a scheme of all types of perceptual unfolded, and of all those intersensorial correspondences which lie beyond the segment of the world which are actually perceived.

365
00:36:36,041 --> 00:36:47,081
The thing is therefore not actually given, it is internally taken up, reconstituted, I wanted to get to that, an experienced by us insofar as it's bound up with the world.

366
00:36:47,961 --> 00:37:08,680
The basic structures of which we carry with us, of which it is merely one of many possible, bound up with the constants experienced by us, so far as it's bound up with our world, the basic structures of which we carry with us, and of which it is merely one of many possible concrete forms.

367
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:18,360
Well, the point is, maybe there's a difference that distinctly can be drawn from the perceptual world and the natural world, but it's not one which bears on the ideals of rivals and contrast.

368
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:29,320
So maybe you want to say the perceptual world is sort of the shape and color, and the natural world is the sort of whole bigness of the whole nature of the thing.

369
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:40,920
But in both cases, the shape and color, no less than the oak trees of the thing, are only available to us thanks to available to us.

370
00:37:42,441 --> 00:37:50,200
That would be to say that when we do unlock them, we really find out what was there all along.

371
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,800
I mean, there are the structures not relative to us in our body.

372
00:37:54,121 --> 00:37:59,761
Even if we were here gone and our body was gone, there would still be these trees and so forth.

373
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,481
I don't know, but I fear not.

374
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:02,961
Let me see.

375
00:37:57,961 --> 00:38:04,240
Let me go one more sentence.

376
00:38:04,401 --> 00:38:15,761
I'll go part of our living experience is transcendent in relation to our life because the human body with its habits, which weave around it, a human environment, has running through it a movement towards the world itself.

377
00:38:16,081 --> 00:38:21,281
See, I think there's a distinction between this human environment and the world itself.

378
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:31,601
I would have thought the human environment was this fair perceptual world, and the world itself is the underlying whatever, which is.

379
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:34,001
Well, let me let's anyway, somebody had a hand up.

380
00:38:34,001 --> 00:38:37,361
I'm ready to hear some other people.

381
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:40,001
I didn't see a hand up.

382
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:40,160
Where?

383
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:40,720
You've got a pretty good question.

384
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,720
Well, right off the nebula quote, which I know you're not.

385
00:38:42,881 --> 00:38:45,200
No, well, I don't mean I don't care where it is.

386
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:46,880
You could get these two together so that.

387
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:54,961
I have no 525 502 breaks into the temporality child.

388
00:38:55,121 --> 00:38:55,760
Okay, got it.

389
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:03,521
It says what is true, taking one thing with another, is that there is a nature, not even two that is a natural world.

390
00:39:03,601 --> 00:39:09,680
Which is not that in the sciences, it's not in the universe, but that which perception presents to me.

391
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:10,960
Yes.

392
00:39:10,961 --> 00:39:19,040
And I'm trying to link this to what Nicozon says even possibly presented to us as well.

393
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,961
Well, I was trying to say that the perceptual world, I'm kind of agreeing with Bala, that is the same as the natural world.

394
00:39:25,921 --> 00:39:28,880
But the perceptual world is a different aspect of describing the world.

395
00:39:28,881 --> 00:39:32,401
It's the world insofar as we deal with it with our perceptions.

396
00:39:32,401 --> 00:39:36,160
It the perceptual world views the natural world as we deal with our perceptions.

397
00:39:36,561 --> 00:39:45,001
And that's and it's and the perceptual world there has to be something that exceeds the perceptual world that is uh we can't get to.

398
00:39:45,001 --> 00:39:49,160
I mean it may ground the perceptual world, but it goes beyond perceptual realms.

399
00:39:42,961 --> 00:39:49,720
And that's the perceptual world.

400
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,960
The passage where Reading Bird goes on actually talks about the natural world.

401
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,400
Let's find it.

402
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:57,561
Calling that, where were we then?

403
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:03,320
Well, I would have thought so too, but but there's now a consensus which would certainly help.

404
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:24,680
And so if we want all these things to fit together, I'd be happy anyway they do, that there is the absolute other, there's the horizon of all horizons, there's the well, these are all names for something, there's the perceptual world, there's the natural world, there's uh that's and how to fit all that together and uh is the question.

405
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:31,721
You can make a important distinction about accessing this natural world and then talking about one world rather than another.

406
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:46,121
You know, I think for him, you know, we the perceptual world comes first for us in terms of trying to explain the body explaining the phenomena and trying to access these phenomena that like ourselves and bodies are names.

407
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:51,160
In order for us to understand this, we have to stick to the phenomenon, think to this perceptual world.

408
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:59,240
But that's not to say that there isn't a a natural world that you can kind of think of without you know perception dealing with it.

409
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:09,880
I mean it's but it's not even not about accessing the natural world because we can only access the due to the perceptual world, but there it's not to say that there's not this natural world that we can kind of conceive of.

410
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:14,440
And the natural world isn't even like stones.

411
00:41:14,441 --> 00:41:22,201
I mean, it isn't just, it isn't nature in the sense of the trees and the stones, because the stone gets cancelled out in that passage I read.

412
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:29,841
And there's something even more minimally structured in our intricate terms.

413
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,001
And that's what puzzles me.

414
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:34,561
Well, is when you start describing it, you bring in all these other things.

415
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,280
That's right.

416
00:41:36,081 --> 00:41:37,840
I think we can't describe it.

417
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:46,080
I mean, I'll keep my position just so you can contrast it with Alva's and maybe what Martin is going to say in a minute.

418
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,361
I have a feeling.

419
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:52,081
But my position is you can't describe it.

420
00:41:52,081 --> 00:41:55,281
It's just what sets these boundary conditions.

421
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:11,201
Anything you say about it or see in it is already something you see because we've got, you've got, we all share a certain body schema which organizes the world into perceptual objects and so forth.

422
00:42:12,481 --> 00:42:16,320
But I'm holding this just in order for you to be able to shoot it down.

423
00:42:17,441 --> 00:42:20,480
I don't have any particular love of this position.

424
00:42:20,481 --> 00:42:27,360
By the way, what it would be, just so you can see the position I feel driven into, would be very close to Kantian.

425
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:43,680
There would be a kind of thing in itself about which you couldn't say anything except that it's the ground of the phenomena, of our shared world, sets the limits on our shared world, keeps us from being able to make it this world any way we please.

426
00:42:43,680 --> 00:43:06,321
And we get in sync with it thanks to, and now the difference between Kant and Nelloponte, we get in sync with it in Kant thanks to the categories which we have in our transcendental consciousness, which enables us to make a shared phenomenal world out of the impingement from the thing in itself, which sets these limits.

427
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:18,761
And Nelloponty, in this reading, I've driven to is saying, well, it isn't the categories in the mind that enables us to organize the thing in itself about which we can say nothing.

428
00:43:19,081 --> 00:43:27,721
It's the shared body schema which enables us to organize that about which we can say nothing.

429
00:43:28,441 --> 00:43:36,841
And the natural world seems when it's the absolute other, anyway, seems to need to be like that.

430
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:53,561
But when the natural world is something, and this is what I think Elvis picked up on and so forth, the horizon of horizons, when the natural world already seems to be full of meaning and relative to us, then it doesn't sound constant.

431
00:43:53,561 --> 00:43:59,321
Then it sounds like we ought to be able to describe this horizon of horizons.

432
00:43:59,881 --> 00:44:09,480
But how we would earlier so far I'd be, well, I was saying this because natural world hidden behind, appears in these perceptions we have.

433
00:44:09,481 --> 00:44:10,280
Okay, it appears.

434
00:44:10,921 --> 00:44:15,720
I've been saying that's what's some limitations or boundaries that you think.

435
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:15,880
Right.

436
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,240
But exactly.

437
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,961
Then we must machine it.

438
00:44:22,601 --> 00:44:24,200
So let me just say that I.

439
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,880
So I don't know who he's saying as you be, but it's corresponding to what Alvin is.

440
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,001
He knows better.

441
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:31,241
But I want to just prove how I do it.

442
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:47,081
So there's when we are, when we take this over, thanks to our body schema and reconstitute it, or as he says at some point, recompose it, it's there's how we find the structure.

443
00:44:47,081 --> 00:44:50,280
I mean, that's, and that is the structure of it, which we find.

444
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,040
And so far, I've been trying to say.

445
00:44:52,081 --> 00:44:54,121
Uh i in what does that mean?

446
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,200
Well, that you can't say more than that.

447
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:01,520
I mean okay, that is the structure I see that a being like us finds in it.

448
00:45:01,521 --> 00:45:03,601
And well, that would be the rich world view.

449
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:04,160
I like that.

450
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:12,320
I mean that would be that there's other points the being might find other things in it, but we I really found a structure in it.

451
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:19,920
If we've gotten in sync with it and organized it, it isn't as if it's it's ineffable.

452
00:45:19,921 --> 00:45:22,800
One of the ways it's equivalent is with one.

453
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,760
And that's what you're saying.

454
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:31,360
Well, but the reason why I said it was to make it difficult, because the console happens the world somehow is hidden behind their appearances.

455
00:45:31,601 --> 00:45:32,001
Okay, good.

456
00:45:35,921 --> 00:45:41,920
It says that the natural world is the dreamer of intrasensory hypervisions.

457
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,720
So you can definitely in terms of some kind of sensory regularities.

458
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,440
And then he usually says that that's not to follow cause.

459
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:50,640
Okay, where are you?

460
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:57,840
It's very much the same way we believe your motivation is on creating one.

461
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,920
Okay, well that sounds important.

462
00:45:59,921 --> 00:46:00,880
I suppose.

463
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,200
Where could I start?

464
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,360
It's the bottom of three eighty for us, I guess.

465
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:14,400
Well, when if you go if you go, this is those breaks to the most here.

466
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:22,721
Okay, well let me get up to the break and say okay to everybody's this is I read the reconstituted part.

467
00:46:22,881 --> 00:46:26,160
That's about fifteen lines from the top of three hundred eighty one.

468
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,240
Maybe we should read somebody else's voice here because it starts studying journalism.

469
00:46:30,401 --> 00:46:33,320
Well, not going to be excluded then in the next part, Joe.

470
00:46:33,401 --> 00:46:35,121
They're right up there but before the break.

471
00:46:35,441 --> 00:46:36,160
Not to the break.

472
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,600
I'm going to read up to the break.

473
00:46:37,601 --> 00:46:38,960
Everybody read up to the break.

474
00:46:38,961 --> 00:46:40,561
Animal behavior and all that.

475
00:46:40,561 --> 00:46:45,160
And it looks, I mean, this leads to the quote on 385, which we looked at.

476
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:49,321
This makes the natural world the horizon of all horizons.

477
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:54,840
And that seems to make it what Alva and Martin are saying.

478
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:59,800
But we didn't just say, I don't understand how that could be called the absolute other.

479
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:07,081
That's the other, that's the thing that bothers me, because horizon is relative to us.

480
00:47:07,081 --> 00:47:08,041
I just don't understand.

481
00:47:09,481 --> 00:47:12,121
The horizon of horizons must be relative to us, too.

482
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:15,160
The very concept of horizon is relative to us.

483
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,040
And therefore, absolute other is what threw me off.

484
00:47:19,881 --> 00:47:26,920
Maybe there are just two conflicting tensions, or maybe I'm disposed to not believe in the absolute other.

485
00:47:26,921 --> 00:47:30,041
Maybe it's the only, the seemingly absolute other or something.

486
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:51,481
Or maybe it's we try to get the boundary conditions back in, saying that we are sort of this other would be there whether we unlocked it or not, and it's what's sort of forcing us to overdiscose it and reconstitute it this way.

487
00:47:51,481 --> 00:48:09,001
And we experience in it a kind of receptivity to some order which we don't compose but recompose, and that order is absolutely other, the order that we take up and recompose.

488
00:48:09,001 --> 00:48:09,640
I don't know.

489
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,041
I mean, that's, you want to say, you look like you want to say something?

490
00:48:12,121 --> 00:48:13,081
I have a couple things.

491
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,920
Let's just go back to what we've been talking about it.

492
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:24,201
I always interpreted the horizon to be the condition of the possibility of our perception.

493
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:28,961
And to me, it seems like the other beggars just be like these structures of non-perception.

494
00:48:27,961 --> 00:48:32,720
Oh, I think horizon by its sort of the metaphor of horizon.

495
00:48:32,881 --> 00:48:42,321
You can only have horizon relative to somebody who's sort of in the middle and of it, and it shapes their around them.

496
00:48:42,320 --> 00:49:04,320
I can't, I mean, how something that was, and this could be both, and I'm trying to keep both, the natural world could be the perceptual world and understood as a horizon, but also understood somehow as what sort of governs and limits the way we make sense of it.

497
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:14,160
Okay, and then you have to say, and you've got two choices.

498
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:25,041
Then it becomes either sort of ineffable and you're, or you say, and it governs the way we perceive it because of the way it is.

499
00:49:25,041 --> 00:49:30,880
And the way it is is what we find out when we get our body schema and perceive it.

500
00:49:30,881 --> 00:49:33,760
And there isn't any sort of X.

501
00:49:35,921 --> 00:49:39,040
And it would be that way whether we unlocked it or not.

502
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:40,640
I mean, I recomposed it or not.

503
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,761
I mean, it's got a structure all of its own.

504
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,720
I like that.

505
00:49:44,961 --> 00:49:46,640
I wish he, and maybe he is.

506
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,160
Maybe he's that much of a realist.

507
00:49:49,441 --> 00:49:50,640
Yeah, well, he does that often.

508
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,840
That's what's causing a problem.

509
00:49:52,081 --> 00:49:54,800
You put the cradle of all meaning directional in all directions here.

510
00:49:55,521 --> 00:50:00,881
On page 500 of our books, you could be four lines down.

511
00:50:00,881 --> 00:50:01,441
Okay.

512
00:50:02,881 --> 00:50:04,320
Hence, we've discovered.

513
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:11,041
Oh, hence, we discovered that the world as a cradle of meaningless direction, the ground of all thinking.

514
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:12,720
How do we find the world?

515
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:25,880
And I know that realism idealism is talking maybe like empiricist realism and concept idealism, but it's still the same point that we've been talking about as the world just being the same into an actual and perceptual world.

516
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,760
I mean, are the points we've been trying to make?

517
00:50:28,921 --> 00:50:36,201
Well, if something which is the horizon of our life, we're back to that again in the primordial unity of our experiences.

518
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:46,760
That sounds like the perceptual world, but it doesn't sound like an absolute other, the horizon of our life and the unity of our experiences.

519
00:50:48,121 --> 00:50:54,201
It is no longer the visible control of a constituting thought, so forth and so forth.

520
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,481
Okay, let me stop.

521
00:50:55,481 --> 00:50:56,920
But we'll have to put the last time.

522
00:50:57,081 --> 00:50:57,640
I don't know.

523
00:50:57,881 --> 00:51:01,001
Just one suggestion, and this is really a speculation here.

524
00:51:01,001 --> 00:51:09,400
In the passage that we just read, he talks about animal behavior as directed to a natural setting and as encountering the resistance.

525
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:17,081
And then he talks about human behavior over the world.

526
00:51:17,081 --> 00:51:37,561
Maybe something about centers of resistance, of Egypt, is what gives you the notion of an absolute other, because there's a way in which we're talking about vision, that if there's an animal, and Zoom said, you're worried about the cleanup that's going to eat you, or the cliff you're going to fall off of, or the hold of your barriers.

527
00:51:38,601 --> 00:51:39,400
I like that.

528
00:51:39,401 --> 00:51:52,200
I like that, there's got to be something that we and animals all have to sort of come up against, which we can enlarge as a shared perceptual world with its ultimate horizon.

529
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:56,521
Let's try to break some of rates are the idea of the natural world with the absolute other?

530
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,640
The absolute other is the absolute resistance.

531
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:00,320
I'm taking that over, right, if that's what I meant.

532
00:52:00,561 --> 00:52:20,880
I thought you were doing is whatever it is that we and the animals all come up against as something that limits us, and not just in a negative way, but to what Martin says, but provides us the opportunity on the basis in which we can respond and make order and so forth, maybe that's the absolute other understood.

533
00:52:21,121 --> 00:52:25,601
I guess not just a bad kind of resistance, but it's affordances too.

534
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:31,761
I mean, resisting and affording to us and to animals, that's the bottom level.

535
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:39,360
And then there's this world perceptual shared cultural human world that we get when we deal with that.

536
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,160
I'm going to have to see what you're going to find.

537
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:49,121
Heidegger and the original world are only a parent very greatly different.

538
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:56,160
He says the world worlds, every single one for all the earth adjusts into or exposes itself more than anything more.

539
00:52:57,521 --> 00:53:02,720
I think that's probably a very useful thing to say, except I suspect nobody here will have any help.

540
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,160
Anybody who's know about Earth.

541
00:53:11,921 --> 00:53:12,480
How many?

542
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:22,320
Yeah, well, if you knew what Heidegger meant by Earth and the origin of the work of art, which is, I think, equally mysterious, I mean, I think I'm afraid it explains the obscure by the more obscure.

543
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,961
You see that it's exactly the same thing.

544
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:30,000
They struggle, the Earth struggles with world would be like in Merlot-Ponte.

545
00:53:30,001 --> 00:53:33,121
The natural world struggles with the perceptual world.

546
00:53:33,121 --> 00:53:36,800
Okay, I want to take the last five minutes to do the fourth level.

547
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,121
I'd feel very bad if I didn't get beyond this level.

548
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,640
And so let me do it.

549
00:53:42,961 --> 00:53:47,480
The objective universe.

550
00:53:48,121 --> 00:53:51,961
Now, there are two sort of parts under that.

551
00:53:51,961 --> 00:54:04,121
The objective universe is something that the human sciences and the neurosciences presuppose.

552
00:54:04,121 --> 00:54:06,201
We're going to try to find a general statement.

553
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:13,321
The objective universe is what science is trying to describe and get the structure of.

554
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,640
It's completely determinate.

555
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:21,640
Presumably, it's got elementary particles in it and they're obeying causal laws and so forth.

556
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:27,081
Now, Merloponty then, this divides into two parts.

557
00:54:27,081 --> 00:54:37,640
Merloponty thinks that, first, you can't explain consciousness and perception and significance in terms of the natural universe.

558
00:54:37,640 --> 00:55:08,361
And that's what's wrong with the human sciences who try to, as people could repress or forget perception, and then empiricism will try to give you a story in the human sciences and so on, intellectualism, which tries to find some objective, independent elements and laws in terms of which to explain everything.

559
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:19,800
And then neuroscience does it on another level, tries to get an account of the brain, which explains significance, holism, indeterminacy, consciousness, and everything.

560
00:55:20,121 --> 00:55:27,601
And Merloponty has the sensible view, I think, that that's just, we couldn't believe that.

561
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,960
That's reductionism.

562
00:55:29,521 --> 00:55:44,721
The idea that you can explain consciousness and significance and the holism of the way of the perceptual world in terms of any elements, the empiricist elements, the intellectualist elements, the physicist elements.

563
00:55:44,720 --> 00:56:01,520
And I think he sort of would hold like Tom Nagel, whom I mentioned, there is just no third-person account possible of this meaningful, first-personal way of experiencing the world that we've got.

564
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:09,360
But I think, and now comes the last move I want to make, I think he feels that he needs a stronger argument than that.

565
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,880
That just sounds dogmatic.

566
00:56:10,881 --> 00:56:12,640
There's Nagel versus Searle.

567
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:19,280
And there's probably another whole list of people you could put on Nagel's side, and a whole list of people you could put on Searle's side.

568
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:24,001
One of them says to then explain it all in terms of the particles and laws finally.

569
00:56:24,001 --> 00:56:27,680
That's all there really finally is, is what physics tells us there is.

570
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,281
That's the objective universe.

571
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:43,041
And the other side says, no, the objective universe is somehow, for some reason or other, incapable of explaining everything.

572
00:56:43,041 --> 00:56:50,880
Now, I think that that's right, but there's a wrong way of trying to defend it.

573
00:56:50,881 --> 00:57:05,041
I think Mero-Ponty feels he needs an argument why it's that the physical universe is incapable of defending us, of explaining our world and our kind of experience.

574
00:57:05,041 --> 00:57:13,561
And then I think he makes the absolutely wrong move that Searle sees he makes and blames him for, but I don't think he should have made it.

575
00:57:13,561 --> 00:57:18,361
And I don't, and where Searle thinks this is what any phenomenologist is going to make, that is the wrong move.

576
00:57:12,881 --> 00:57:19,640
I think you don't have to make it.

577
00:57:19,881 --> 00:57:25,481
But the wrong move is to say, well, science is really some kind of abstraction.

578
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,960
It's not getting at.

579
00:57:27,961 --> 00:57:32,680
I mean, it's not getting at what there really is in the universe.

580
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:37,401
So naturally, it can't explain significance and consciousness and so forth.

581
00:57:37,401 --> 00:57:41,720
At 468, in ours now at the top, he's been.

582
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:47,160
I don't know what the right way is saying that science is limited and can't explain meaning and significance.

583
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:50,840
I think probably the thing to say is we don't know yet whether it can or not.

584
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:54,121
We haven't got an argument that's convincing.

585
00:57:54,121 --> 00:58:01,801
But the argument that's not convincing is that you can, where is it, 468?

586
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:07,481
We are led by as much as the realist believes the subject of eternity with the morality.

587
00:58:07,961 --> 00:58:10,041
He's saying, there, that's not very helpful.

588
00:58:10,041 --> 00:58:14,680
You can't believe in, maybe it's visible, but that wasn't, that wasn't very interesting.

589
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,041
Let's try this.

590
00:58:16,041 --> 00:58:17,160
458.

591
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,041
No, I don't know what I meant here.

592
00:58:20,041 --> 00:58:26,201
But let me tell you, natural science, he says, is an abstraction from the natural world.

593
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,441
He says this on 351.

594
00:58:28,601 --> 00:58:28,840
What?

595
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:29,880
Let me get your book.

596
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,240
3.409.

597
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:32,361
Let's look.

598
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:33,800
Yeah, right.

599
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:38,680
And this is this important Magel-like quote on the middle of 409.

600
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:47,400
I don't know where the abstraction is, but how significance and intentionality could come to dwell in molecular edifices or cells can never be made comprehensible.

601
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,881
And here, and here Cartesianism is right.

602
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:59,680
And then, skipping down, the body as a tentacle structure or an agglomeration of tissues is formed by a process of impoverishment.

603
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,561
That's a very important line.

604
00:58:57,881 --> 00:59:04,800
You can hear that two ways.

605
00:59:05,121 --> 00:59:07,040
One way, it's absolutely right.

606
00:59:07,041 --> 00:59:15,361
You've got to leave out a lot of what there is to say about the body to describe the physical body as a machine with tissues and so forth.

607
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,521
But there's nothing wrong with that.

608
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:45,201
It's only when you use the idea that science is a very impoverished version of the rich world and the scientific objective body is a very thin impoverishment of the lived body, when you use that to argue that somehow you couldn't from these elements explain the richer stuff.

609
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,520
It depends on how you hear this impoverishment.

610
00:59:47,521 --> 00:59:55,521
If you hear it, yes, you leave out a lot, and what you finally get is Cartesian space and particles and laws.

611
00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:00,561
That's right, but nothing follows from that about what you can explain.

612
01:00:00,561 --> 01:00:11,361
Or, except that you've got a lot of explaining to do because you've left out meaning and significance and the body schema and all that, and that may well be impossible to explain.

613
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:18,721
But you can't claim just because science has found this minimal level of description that it couldn't explain it.

614
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,320
But that's what he concludes.

615
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,601
That's the trouble.

616
01:00:21,601 --> 01:00:23,521
This is where I think he goes wrong.

617
01:00:23,521 --> 01:00:30,800
On 391 of your book, what?

618
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,760
455.

619
01:00:34,401 --> 01:00:37,441
I'm going to go very fast over this if you guys need time to write.

620
01:00:37,441 --> 01:00:46,041
He just becomes, I mean, the next move, besides saying science is an impoverishment, is to say science is just a social construction.

621
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:56,841
At that point, you've gone beyond saying that it's a very thin objective universe that science talks about, which doesn't prove what you can and can't explain.

622
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:00,280
to there really isn't any universe that science is talking about.

623
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,881
It's a construction.

624
01:01:01,881 --> 01:01:05,240
That's what he says, and that's where he just goes wrong.

625
01:01:05,481 --> 01:01:11,160
He has a strong argument, all right, but I don't see why we should believe it at the top of 455.

626
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:20,601
He says, prosaic and scientific utterance is a cultural entity which at the same time lays claim to translated truth related to nature in itself.

627
01:01:20,601 --> 01:01:23,321
Now we know that this is not the case.

628
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:29,401
But modern criticism of the sciences has clearly shown the constructive element in them.

629
01:01:29,401 --> 01:01:35,881
Well, that's to make what Searle calls it as confusion between epistemology and ontology.

630
01:01:35,881 --> 01:01:53,160
That's to say that the way we know about scientific entities, which of course depends on language and lots of scientific, that that's somehow intrinsic to what the scientific entities are, that they are constructions.

631
01:01:53,160 --> 01:02:11,961
Whereas all you want to say, if you want to be through to the phenomena and so forth, all you have a right to say that's the way to put it, is that if it weren't for our language and our scientific practices, we couldn't have access to the entities that science discovers.

632
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:21,160
Now, maybe it's true that what we get access to is really not discovered, but somehow constituted by this access.

633
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:33,520
But it doesn't follow from the fact that you need science and laboratory practices to talk about electrons and nebula, that electrons and nebuli are cultural products.

634
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:41,840
That's what he finally says of this outrageous passage on wherever it is that I always get upset about at the end of the time chapter, 502.

635
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:50,321
where he talks about Laplace's nebula, about two-thirds stem, is not behind us, but is in front of us in the cultural world.

636
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:54,160
And I guess I've got to stop here because let me just see if I...

637
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:59,761
Yeah, so I think that he is an idealist about scientific entities.

638
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,000
There's no doubt about it.

639
01:03:02,001 --> 01:03:04,160
He thinks they're constructed.

640
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:10,800
And he thinks that if we weren't here, there couldn't be any electrons and galaxies and so forth.

641
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,640
I think that's just wrong.

642
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,640
But that's not the interesting issue.

643
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,160
He could fix that.

644
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:28,961
What we really want to know is the stuff we spend most of the time discussing, what this natural world is, and how it's independent of us, and how he's neither an idealist nor a realist about the perceptual natural world.

645
01:03:28,961 --> 01:03:30,721
I've got to stop with that.

646
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:31,280
Okay.
