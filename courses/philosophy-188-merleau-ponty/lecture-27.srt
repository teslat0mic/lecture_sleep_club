1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,680
So to tell myself about it, I wrote this, which probably you can't read, that being in the world and existence comes in two varieties.

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:18,239
There's, I think, what's called the tacit cogito, and then there's certainly a Cartesian cogito.

3
00:00:18,239 --> 00:01:04,479
And this is about perception, this is about thought, this is pre-reflective, this is always reflection, this is motor intentionality, this is representational intentionality, this will be impersonal, like the body schema, this is the I think, that's engaged, and that's detached, and most important of all, that this one is supposed to be founded, I should really, I don't know where to put this, but the thesis of it all is not just that there are these two and that Descartes and all people after him, like Kant and Husserl, only thought about this one, but the thesis is that there not only that there is this, but that this is more basic than this.

4
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,280
This is founded on this.

5
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,800
That's what the whole chapter's about, I think.

6
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,240
So to connect up with last time, now I guess I've got everything.

7
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:16,639
Yeah.

8
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:28,599
So to connect up with last time, let's look at some pages for those ones I wrote on the board that are so important that I put them, that I thought I've said them, I want to say them again.

9
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,439
The middle of 473, that's where we get the name passive cogito for this.

10
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:41,880
I think it could also be called it is also sometimes called the pre-reflective cogito and so forth.

11
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:44,920
But I think the main name for it is passive cogito.

12
00:01:44,920 --> 00:02:05,959
And he says about 15 lines down, what remains on the hither side of my particular thoughts that constitute the tacit cogito and the original thoughts, what remains, yeah, and the original project towards the world and what ultimately gets left.

13
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,880
So this is answered a question.

14
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:10,360
Oh, no wonder I can't make sense of it.

15
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,160
Let's try it again.

16
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,959
Well, what?

17
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:12,519
Question.

18
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:18,280
What remains on the other side of my particular thoughts that constitute the tacit cogito and the original project towards the world?

19
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:26,360
And what ultimately am I, insofar as I can catch a glimpse of myself independently of any particular act on the field of experience?

20
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,040
Well, we've heard that often.

21
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:38,360
The main reason I'm reading it is the tacit cogito is there, something that I am, and it's something different than reflection, and you've got to catch a glimpse of it.

22
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:46,519
That's that whole issue of how you ever catch a glimpse of it, because you can't catch a glimpse of it if you reflect on it, because that will transform it.

23
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:50,040
But we're not going to go into that, fall into that hole.

24
00:02:50,040 --> 00:03:07,239
So on the 474, there are these important and weird statements, partly to deal with the sense in which there is an inner, which I still think is hard to get straight.

25
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:13,800
But I wanted to hear his note on 474 about I belong to myself while belonging to the world.

26
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:27,279
Something, this belonging to myself is something like what used to be called, or what was thought of as the inner, though it's certainly different than the inner for reasons we'll see.

27
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:35,679
But notice then, about a little below the middle, the world is wholly inside me, and I'm wholly outside myself.

28
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:38,400
That's the weird sentence to explain.

29
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,599
The B, it's wholly inside of me, because it's my experience.

30
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,399
It really is.

31
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:45,920
You can't deny it.

32
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:52,239
But my experience is just the experience of being an open head turned towards the world.

33
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,800
That's the hard thing to get used to.

34
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,040
So it's my experience.

35
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,480
It's not in some sense in my mind.

36
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,239
There's nothing in my mind.

37
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,280
Sometimes it looks like what he's saying, he doesn't have a mind.

38
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,559
I think that can't be right.

39
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:11,199
He thinks this actually happens, and this can call mind.

40
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,559
But you'd have to be careful when you did.

41
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:28,559
So anyway, those two sentences seem to be very important and always to keep in mind that when you're trying to figure out whether there is some kind of inner.

42
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:34,000
There is the experience of being a perspective on the world.

43
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:42,319
But that experience isn't anything that you can separate from actually interacting with the world.

44
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,319
That's the way I belong to myself while belonging to the world.

45
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:52,079
And that's the level at which I'm wholly inside and wholly outside, I think.

46
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:03,720
Otherwise, that list is just meant to show you various ways that these two columns are referred to.

47
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:36,439
I wanted to read also the important thing on 475, which seems to say, and though there are other ways of thinking about it, and I got email about this and discussion about this, nobody actually has denied that the way I belong to myself while being open in the world is probably generally something like, well, that's an experience.

48
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:56,600
If you ask sort of what experience could there be besides just empty head turned toward world, where the experience you have to say is there are people in the room in front of me and trees outside there, and you wouldn't be saying anything about what was mine.

49
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:08,600
I still think there is something that is mine, and that's this feeling that things are going all right or else they aren't when I'm getting my grip on the world.

50
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:22,280
And the funny thing is, and those are intermittent because when everything is going well, this is a bird of complication I haven't ever mentioned, it isn't, I think, that you just don't have a feeling that things are going wrong.

51
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:29,480
So all that you really ever have a feeling of is of your own sort of private, important feeling.

52
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:56,800
I mean, there are dreams and tickles and pains and itches, but the important, sort of transcendental, or trend would say, a feeling which is absolutely crucial for you to have a world and have objects at all is the tension you feel when you're not getting the optimal grip and you feel that everything else being equal, you better go over there.

53
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:04,480
You just don't because there are other things that you're getting a grip on over here and you can't be getting a grip on everything all the time.

54
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:13,280
The fact that you feel when you look at the front of the house that you get a fuller look at the house if you could go around and look at the fact is true.

55
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,759
But of course then you wouldn't be looking at the front and so you never get an optimal grip.

56
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:29,360
And maybe in that sense you always got a sense of the pull to get a better grip on the world.

57
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:36,079
So that maybe there is never a zero moment in which you are getting the fullest grip.

58
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,040
I don't know which to say.

59
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,239
See, I'm confused about that.

60
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:54,480
But I want to say on the other hand, yes, that when you're in full coping flow and everything is really right and you're absorbed in finding a mountain or playing tennis or whatever you're doing, then it seems to me you don't even have a feeling that everything is going well.

61
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,199
You're just totally absorbed in what you're doing.

62
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,360
And I don't know which marriage punching things.

63
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,600
I'll read you this passage, not that it settles it.

64
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:02,800
It's just about this.

65
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,280
About 15 lines down.

66
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:16,160
My existence as subjectivity, which is, well, I guess, you know, this, I suppose, well, no, subjectivity is subjectivity is going to be in both columns.

67
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,280
There's a kind of subjectivity over here and a kind of subjectivity over here.

68
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:33,000
And he's interested in now telling you about this kind of subjectivity, which is, again, this all that's left of the notion of my experience of being wholly inside and all that.

69
00:08:33,319 --> 00:08:46,600
My existence of subjectivity is nearly one with my existence as a body and with the existence of the world, and because the subject that I am, when taken concretely, is inseparable from the body and the world.

70
00:08:46,599 --> 00:09:02,760
The ontological world and body, which we find at the core of the subject, that so aside of the subject, are not the world or body as idea, but on the one hand, the world itself contracted into a comprehensive grasp.

71
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,160
There's the gripping story again.

72
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:11,640
And on the other, the body itself as a knowing body, I take it, that is, as a grasping body.

73
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:26,120
I take it there more as a body that has in it a body schema which guides it to constantly get a better and better grip on the world or handy towards that.

74
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,920
So that's all past stuff.

75
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,920
So now the new stuff.

76
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:39,160
So the story is we function in both these columns, and the question is, how are they related?

77
00:09:39,800 --> 00:10:06,200
And it starts already to be a bad move if you call this column mind or what else did I have in here, subject, only because that's been taken over so much by the Cartesian tradition that it now seems that the mind is a self-sufficient domain that has in it a kind of indubitable content.

78
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:12,280
And if that's what mind is, then we don't want it in either column because there's just no such thing.

79
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:17,280
That's a sort of illegitimate extrapolation of this in that direction.

80
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:32,800
And subject has certainly come to me from Descartes to Kant to Husserl, some self-contained sphere of pure well-constituting experience of some sort.

81
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,040
And you don't want to say that.

82
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,720
But you do want to say something.

83
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:50,400
And you want to say that it's the reason you don't want to say that is that it's not self-sufficient and it's not foundational.

84
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:58,800
And therefore it's not like Descartes, Kant, Husserl, and I don't know about Searle.

85
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:11,120
And Searle is sort of sorted in this column, but because he's got a background and because he thinks there's a world of blue facts and so forth, he's not going to turn out to be somebody fully in this column.

86
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,959
So Merloponi doesn't want to just now talk about these two columns.

87
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:20,080
He wants to reverse the Cartesian claim that this is what's basic.

88
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:31,200
And if you have to think about that at all, you either understand all these stuff as unimportant or you ignore it, or for perception, for instance, you treat it as a kind of thought.

89
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:34,800
You're a cognitivist and an intellectualist.

90
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,480
And that, but what's really basic is this.

91
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,960
That's what he wants to reverse.

92
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:49,360
So you want to say to be in the column, you can call, so I won't have to keep pointing to column A, let's say A and column B.

93
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,040
That doesn't depend on anything except me to be able to talk about it.

94
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,840
You want to say that column B requires column A and not vice versa.

95
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,920
That is, you could be in this without that, but you can't be in that without this.

96
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,280
That's the big thesis.

97
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:14,920
Well, and there seem to be two pieces of the argument which runs through here.

98
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm not going to redo the argument or try to construct it even, but there is a whole lot of discussion about how both columns require the background.

99
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:32,840
And the background just is a holistic version of this stuff.

100
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,640
The background is not a belief system.

101
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:46,759
The background is the way all of our practices, skills, hoping, and so forth hang together, even when we're not thematizing them.

102
00:12:46,760 --> 00:13:02,360
So that comes out a lot, and I'll have to talk about it again in a minute, when we get back to his claim that even thinking requires a background, and that the background is always over here.

103
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:04,040
That's part of the argument.

104
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:14,520
I think the other half of the argument is that this kind of disengagement always has to have an engagement that it disengages from.

105
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:24,840
I don't know if that's a really deep point or whether that's just a a linguistic thing that you can help yourself to by just naming everything this way.

106
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:32,760
I guess it's something like the fact that we do talk about this as the disengaged attitude that he wants to say isn't accidental.

107
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:44,160
We have to refer to to it that way because it's always something that you find yourself in this and then you lose something, you get over here, and that's getting disengaged from that.

108
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,320
That's important too.

109
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,559
Okay, I have a moment to stop.

110
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:54,000
That's an attempt to get clear of the issues from last time.

111
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,040
I don't really want to argue about it, but I'm ready to explain it.

112
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,760
Yeah.

113
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:04,560
I heard a question about how to understand the occurrence of the feeling of tension.

114
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,560
Maybe it's a mistake to speak of it as a feeling of tension.

115
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,959
Maybe that's a psychologizing way of characterizing it.

116
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:23,679
It turns it into something that already seems to come subjective.

117
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,880
Maybe there's a more bodily way.

118
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,920
I think that's the personal way of thinking about the tension.

119
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:40,640
So that's the issue of argument to argue not is actually another question of whether or not you're slowly adjusting that responding to the totally underneath.

120
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,520
I like that.

121
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,600
Yes, let's say what we could have just said.

122
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:51,840
What I could have said is you're always responding to a pull, which you're moving to do something.

123
00:14:51,839 --> 00:15:05,280
And I don't think you can get away from something like reduce the tension, reduce a tension, tension like on a spring, and a pull towards an equilibrium.

124
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,160
Those are narrow parts of the term, but it doesn't have to be called a feeling.

125
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,760
And it needs to be something which the subject has to have.

126
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,000
Right.

127
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,280
It isn't a private idea.

128
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:14,479
It should be like the ones that are.

129
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,359
Good, good.

130
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:17,439
It isn't a private feeling.

131
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,679
It isn't something I have as a subject.

132
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:27,199
That my body is attuned to the tensions and disequilibria and pulled to straighten them out.

133
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,720
But I thought you wanted to put once a minute.

134
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:30,760
Okay.

135
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,800
Open brain versus.

136
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:36,520
Right, but you just put the last nail in the top and for that.

137
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:50,920
I got more and more unhappy at that claim because I couldn't find any claim in the chapter that said it that I didn't, that I'm the one who gave myself the problem, find something over here which is the truth of the privacy over here.

138
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,120
And now I'm ready.

139
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,120
And I've gotten more and more unhappy with it.

140
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,239
You heard me backing down.

141
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,400
Well, maybe you don't feel it all the time.

142
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,160
I think Al was all right.

143
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,800
In the end, I should back down even further and say, well, it isn't something that you feel.

144
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:08,600
You don't have to thematize it or, well, never mind.

145
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:09,559
That's just a different point.

146
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:12,120
It isn't something you as a subject feel.

147
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:14,840
It's something that your body just does.

148
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:16,920
It seems like a better way to talk about it.

149
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,400
Yeah.

150
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,959
So there's some sort of gravitational theory.

151
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:20,280
Yeah.

152
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:22,360
Then you lose rationality in those things.

153
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,839
Oh, sure, then lose rationality.

154
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:25,400
That's all right.

155
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,839
I can't find it.

156
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,199
But then how do you help them break down?

157
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:31,559
How do you veil an action?

158
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:33,319
I'm going to know it all brainwashed.

159
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,760
Ah, oh, good, good, good.

160
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,199
Okay, I wouldn't call that rationality maybe, but we can call it that.

161
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:41,480
I think the rationality is so over here.

162
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,319
But you need something.

163
00:16:43,639 --> 00:17:06,520
There is the story of the sort of gravitational view of it, as Jennifer says, and I've always got in my mind something like if the brain has got attractors and it's always trying to relax to the bottom of an attractor, which sounds like a gravitational metaphor for some kind of least energy thing, that we shouldn't, I mean, that's not the phenomenon.

164
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:13,399
If we got the phenomena right, then we help neural people like Walter Freeman defend their radical views.

165
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:23,520
But let me go on and think about where I think that the breakdown has got to be sort of internal to this five.

166
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,399
It isn't something that you only discover over here.

167
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:38,800
It's something that happens over here that throws you over here because when there is a problem, you can put all this on the back burner into the background and you'll think about it.

168
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:46,719
But when things break down, it isn't that you're already, they break down because you're already thinking about it.

169
00:17:46,720 --> 00:18:04,879
They break down because it's like this gravity metaphor and just trying to take it over is pulling you in some direction and bang, it pulls you into a wall and you can't get any further in that direction and the pull is still there and the wall is still there.

170
00:18:04,879 --> 00:18:06,879
Then you've got to figure something out.

171
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:19,520
I mean, let's, I mean, my more concrete example without a metaphor is, so I'm going to go out of the room, my hand is pulled to get ready for the doorknob without my thinking about it at all or feeling it at all.

172
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:30,000
It's just my body, this is trying to take over all this thing, my body is just getting organized for that kind of funny doorknob instead of a round doorknob and so forth.

173
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:39,280
And when I get there, either you could think magically it turns into a round doorknob or I'm part of a psychological experiment where it does.

174
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,200
And then my grip breaks down.

175
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,000
It was set to do this and now it's got to do that.

176
00:18:44,879 --> 00:18:47,760
Maybe I'm so good at doors, I could cope with that.

177
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,520
Maybe I've never seen a door like that.

178
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,280
For a long time, they were only in Europe and the round doors were only in the United States.

179
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,359
Anyway, whatever.

180
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:58,680
Some it breaks down and I have to do something about it.

181
00:18:58,399 --> 00:19:04,440
The other possibility would be, I love I think of more, uh you get there and the doorknob is stuck.

182
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:11,559
That'll certainly fix it if what you've been drawn to is to get out of the room and get a maximum dribble on lunch.

183
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:15,640
And there's another possibility I think, and I'm just trying to make him up.

184
00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:23,399
You'd say to somebody, I want you to go over to the door and just act as if you were about to turn the doorknob and don't do it.

185
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:36,359
We can do that because that puts us into this thing that Schneider can't do that because he really is a full example of this body gravity business.

186
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,479
Now, did I help you?

187
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,319
You want to account for flexibility so you can change your mind in the flow.

188
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:51,000
I mean, you want to be able to account for being able to go down the hall and all of a sudden turn it off when it wasn't.

189
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:55,879
I think this is easy or giving a greater...

190
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,719
I don't think you want to get rid of that.

191
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,079
I'm not getting rid of it.

192
00:19:59,879 --> 00:20:09,160
Well, I think we're going to sort of gravitate to a whole and we're reacting to the world in this methodistic kind of way.

193
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:15,079
Oh yeah, Eric is the world authority on directed discontent.

194
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:17,079
I think you're going to say something about that.

195
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:30,440
I think there is I think Elvid means that correct means to get rid of everything that has to do with first-person experience or subjective experience.

196
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:36,360
He doesn't like the term of feeling because it was rumors related to the subject.

197
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:50,240
There can be some kind of experience in between COVID in between something that's a feeling of the subject and just the behavior that is being used.

198
00:20:51,200 --> 00:21:02,960
Wittgenstein tries to describe it, and Eric has written about this, as it tries to describe the kind of discontent that you've got when things are not going well and you're absorbed in it.

199
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,159
It describes a tailor making lapel.

200
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:17,359
And when the tailor gets it wrong, he starts to look unhappy and sort of, I don't know what else he does, but he probably, if the worst throws down his scissors or something.

201
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:23,520
There are obviously signs of behavior that go with this experience.

202
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:26,559
It shows itself in his behavior.

203
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:27,999
It doesn't have to be felt.

204
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:31,119
Yeah, that's what I think Wittgenstein thinks.

205
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,079
Adding an inner side to it, then asking yourself, what does a tailor have to feel?

206
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:37,040
You don't have to.

207
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,879
All he has to do is stop, be correct.

208
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,639
He'll look disgruntled.

209
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,319
Maybe he'll feel disgruntled.

210
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:50,319
But that's not what's important.

211
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:50,880
I take it.

212
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:52,239
That's what you think is going on.

213
00:21:52,399 --> 00:21:55,679
I didn't say that's not what it's important, but he said what he was saying to behave.

214
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,679
But we've got what we still have to answer again.

215
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,800
Wittgenstein's going to emphasize, of course, the public behavioral aspects of it.

216
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,199
Rick.

217
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:12,079
I thought this was re-ashering the question I asked Sean, which is what's the relation between motor intentionality and consciousness.

218
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:20,319
And his answer at the data sign is that I guess he was quoting Lilo Panchi, who says that all this stuff happens on the margins of consciousness.

219
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:48,040
And it's important that something like this has to happen for the normal person, because if not, you run into the objection that the danger is to overgeneralize from Schneider's normal people, but as precise as Schneider described trying to address how many words we don't want to make the tension crystal clear in consciousness like a feeling, but we don't want to make it completely unconscious, which is the Schneider problem.

220
00:22:48,040 --> 00:23:03,240
So this kind of lung of your own body state, which can come is on the fringe of consciousness, it can be striking, like when you're looking at a painting, and sometimes you really do sense the discomfort in looking at something and not hearing it correctly.

221
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:03,639
Right.

222
00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:08,679
But just that it happens sometimes, doesn't it mean it's a conscious or conspicuous feeling all the time?

223
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,159
That's good.

224
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:11,159
I think that's absolutely right.

225
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:14,119
It's such a hard thing to get a grip on.

226
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:22,600
It's just because, but I do think if you, Jennifer, the two TAs have gotten sort of been a, it's like a ping pong ball between them.

227
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:40,280
I mean, you want to you want to say it's not a kind of feeling that's something that you could you know you're focusing your attention on and and in the garden of the business schematizing, but it you can't just be like an object in a gravitational field either.

228
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:46,199
Then you become like Schneider, like a zombie, like a robot, and you were not like that.

229
00:23:46,200 --> 00:24:09,559
So you've got to say, I think Sean is right, it's just so hard to figure out what it means, that there is always dimly on the margin of awareness enough of a sense of whether it's going well or badly, so that when it goes badly, you're pulled out of it and don't just crash into the door or sort of slay at the doorknob and so forth.

230
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,479
And it's going well or poorly for the body subject, not the mind.

231
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,040
But okay, but where is this consciousness?

232
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,399
Is it a body conscious?

233
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,280
Is body conscious?

234
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:33,439
Okay, well, this is so hard to think, but I, I mean, of course it's hard to think because we've been in the Cartesian tradition for 300 years that consciousness is inner, is mental, and so forth.

235
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:58,399
And either you sort of give it up and try to be a behaviorist like Wittgenstein and just talk about how it looks, or you try to do the phenomenology of it, at which point you've got to describe something which is not the usual sort of inner, or not inner objects, but this marginal kind of awareness that the body has and enables it to be flexible and cope.

236
00:24:58,399 --> 00:24:59,679
That's what you think.

237
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:05,359
Because the body's not a mechanism, it's a kind of conscious entity.

238
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:09,839
That's why motor intentionality is motor intentionality, not motor replacement.

239
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:11,040
Okay, that's good.

240
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,520
Yeah.

241
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,079
Just a question I think is sort of related.

242
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:20,959
Do you think Louis Blanche does way all together with having rationality, or do you think he's saying this is secondary to motor intentionality?

243
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,800
Oh, yeah, rationality goes over there.

244
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,559
He can have all the rationality he wants.

245
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,159
I don't think he gives away any rationality.

246
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,000
Do you think that Schneider has rationality?

247
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,839
Some kinds of rationality, yeah.

248
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:34,559
Right.

249
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,920
Good, yes, good point.

250
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:52,319
Schneider could figure out how to go home, figure out what a metaphor is by thinking it out, and he can figure out what sex is by seeing what people do and deducing what he should do, but he hasn't got motor intentionality.

251
00:25:52,879 --> 00:25:57,679
I don't think rationality has much to do with just tension, but I mean, that's strictly.

252
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:58,119
That's right.

253
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:59,479
No, yes, I think Jennifer.

254
00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:00,920
And it doesn't have to do that.

255
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:01,479
Good, good, good.

256
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:09,159
I think, right, the dialectic of what Jennifer started is to say, well, we aren't zombies.

257
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:11,480
We're not in a gravitational hole.

258
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:13,000
It's not mechanical.

259
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,679
It's got to be rational.

260
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,760
And I think the Merlot-Ponty then answers is what Rick said.

261
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:39,319
Well, rationalism is the right word for it, marginal consciousness, whatever that is, which doesn't have to be anything like the intellectualist is thinking about the cognitivist, but it has to be flexibly taking account, constantly able to be flexibly taking account.

262
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:41,000
Okay, that's helpful.

263
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,520
Now we've got Albert.

264
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:50,040
Yeah, well, I just wanted to start in the word that Jennifer's question is.

265
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:57,319
The issue is to try to show how atheism being doesn't isn't foundational perspective.

266
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:05,559
Your question, has it been treated partition consciousness as the foundation by most of being consciousness?

267
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:10,760
And it did by, and that's what my word was that talking about feelings does that too.

268
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:19,879
I think you did it by referring to the subject who needs to kind of view position through a GG and judge the extents of the detention.

269
00:27:19,879 --> 00:27:23,079
So, and then, as he said, so that's fascinating to say.

270
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,679
And I think what Google said is exactly right somehow.

271
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:39,479
Even the very niche of the self, who is the one you feel in the patient has, must in some sense, be supervening on all that stuff going on in column A browser and got issues and judges what is going on.

272
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:47,599
Okay, I think you should go on, because that was supposed to be, but I do still want to stay in the cocky till for a bit longer.

273
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:57,199
Because I got email that showed me that there was also an issue that I didn't take up, which is about the feeling issue.

274
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:15,920
And it's interesting, and it shows how another way of worrying about this, there's all this business about whether how you experience the meaning of your life and whether you got a direct access, whether some kind of knowing whether you're in love or not.

275
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,480
We're not going to talk about indubitable sense data.

276
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,040
That's done.

277
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,319
We did that well.

278
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:21,919
But I don't think I did well.

279
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,040
The idea of whether you have indubitable feeling data.

280
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:31,439
And not now, not now, not the feeling data, which is a good thing we just discussed and put aside.

281
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,720
You don't need indubitable feeling data from over here to operate over here.

282
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,879
That's what we've just been saying.

283
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,559
We've got our own kind of sensitivity over here.

284
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,719
Well, how about this feeling data about your life or life?

285
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,079
I could say.

286
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:57,199
Well, that's something that Miramo Fonte is talking about in an interesting way, and you won't understand it probably, because he's taking that start.

287
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:14,559
And I just want to tell you what he's taking up and how he answers it, because it's got to do with this funny issue, again, you've got to get used to from lots of different points of view, that you can have an indubitable feeling, and the feeling could turn out to be wrong.

288
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:23,359
Remember, in perception, you can be certain you've done everything that you could, and you know that this object is really the object you're dealing with, that it's got an optimal grip on it.

289
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:27,200
And even then, it could just fade out and disappear.

290
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:39,160
In principle, there's always more to the object than you could ever get a full grip on, and therefore, even though you've got enough sort of grip to be certain, you could turn out to be wrong.

291
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:41,959
I mean, this is weird, but that's how it is.

292
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,760
Well, the same thing happens in our life, according to Merofonte.

293
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:48,119
I just found this this morning, and I can't resist talking about it.

294
00:29:48,680 --> 00:30:00,760
Gartner has this interesting example of somebody who has an adolescent emotional crisis, and they take it to be a religious experience, and the guy goes into a monastery.

295
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:10,919
But then, after he's been there for X number of years, he reconsiders it and decides, no, it was an adolescent temporary psychosis.

296
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:16,680
He should be out in the business world, and he goes out in the business world, and that works fine too.

297
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:29,079
But now that's all the further Sartre goes, but I've always thought he should go in one more, and then on his deathbed, he decides to write, well, no, no, it was really a religious experience after all, and repents the time in the business world.

298
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:41,159
The point is supposed to be, for Sartre, you can never have any kind of certainty about your vocation or the meaning of your life.

299
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:45,400
And Merrill-Ponty wants to say, there's something right about Sartre.

300
00:30:45,720 --> 00:31:00,599
You can never have it indubitably, but nonetheless, you can certainly tell the difference between a vocation, say, love and infatuation, or this adolescent experience and a religious experience.

301
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:06,119
This goes on on 442, 441, it starts.

302
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,200
He's answering Sartre.

303
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,359
Sart's at the bottom of 440.

304
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:17,440
That's when he suddenly starts talking about an incident of puberty as the first signs of a religious vocation.

305
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,480
Starts four or five pages, gets to be half a sentence here, without even a footnote.

306
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,920
And now he's talking about it.

307
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:38,239
He answers: there must be discoverable in some character in it, that is my experience, this puberty experience or religious experience, some characteristic which distinguishes vocation from incident.

308
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:47,919
In the first case, the mythical attitude insinuates itself into my basic relation, mystical attitude, insinuates itself into my basic relationship to the world and other people.

309
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,079
That is, I relate to everything through it.

310
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,599
That's the real vocation.

311
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:57,520
In the second, it is within the subject as an impersonal form of behavior devoid of inner necessity.

312
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:11,119
That's this thing he calls mistaken love, where it's only because I'm lonely or I'm middle-aged or I'm in a foreign country or something that I think I've got this experience.

313
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:21,119
And the important thing that Merlot-Ponty wants to say is that there's got to be some distinction.

314
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:22,159
And he does it.

315
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:22,559
Let's see.

316
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,040
I'm going to keep track of where I am.

317
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,040
I just read the top of 441.

318
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:32,319
On 442, very little below the middle.

319
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:40,959
What remains on the hither side of inner perception and makes no impression on the inward sense is not an unconscious.

320
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:41,999
I didn't want to read that.

321
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,119
That's just, never mind that.

322
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,079
Nothing wrong with it.

323
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,520
I'm just not going to talk about that.

324
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:57,439
He says, my life, my total being, is not dubious constructs, but the phenomena which are indubitably revealed to reflection.

325
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,559
It's simply a question of what I'm doing.

326
00:32:59,879 --> 00:33:07,319
Well, that means that when I'm in it, really involved in it, I'll know it.

327
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,520
It's like maximum grip.

328
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,959
I'll show you in a second.

329
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,120
And that is farm.

330
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:21,720
That the just doing of it, though it makes it indubitable, you'll see, it doesn't make it certain.

331
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,400
He's on 445.

332
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:26,199
He's got more sorrow again on 444.

333
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:36,200
And on 445, he says when he starts saying you could never be sincere, you could never know what you're genuinely feeling.

334
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:46,119
And he says about 15 lines down, the only way out and into sincerity is by forestalling such scruples and taking a blind plunge into doing.

335
00:33:46,439 --> 00:33:49,000
I think that's what he does think.

336
00:33:48,999 --> 00:33:53,880
I think he thinks that as long as you stay over here and reflect, you can't have.

337
00:33:53,879 --> 00:34:08,120
But if you just throw yourself into this supposed love and live your life in it, it'll become clear to you whether it's the superficial thing or whether it's something that really defines who you are.

338
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:14,040
I'm going to read you just one more thing on 446, about 15 lines down.

339
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:16,760
It'll start in the same way.

340
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:22,280
I can never coincide with my life, which is forever fleeing from itself.

341
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,319
In spite of which, there are inner perceptions.

342
00:34:25,319 --> 00:34:27,800
This is something for Rick to worry about.

343
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,160
It's just what he's going to use.

344
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:31,159
He does believe in the inner, I think.

345
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,439
Well, yeah, he believes in the inner, like that.

346
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,559
Okay, right, right.

347
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:35,160
That's right.

348
00:34:35,479 --> 00:34:38,280
They're not these inner objects like inner feelings.

349
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,879
Yes, there are inner perceptions.

350
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:42,800
That is, you can feel in love.

351
00:34:42,439 --> 00:34:47,439
Or for the same reason that I am open to both illusion truths about myself.

352
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:52,960
That is, there are acts in which I collect myself together in order to surpass myself.

353
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:57,440
The co-gito is the recognition of this fundamental act.

354
00:34:57,439 --> 00:35:01,040
I take it that must be the passive cogito.

355
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:08,720
That is, the co-guito in which I get the best grip on my life.

356
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:12,399
I want to say, just skipping a little, oh, notes goes on.

357
00:35:12,399 --> 00:35:18,479
It says, in a position, I think the two assertions are to be flattened with each other, otherwise, there would be no cogito.

358
00:35:18,479 --> 00:35:21,680
Nevertheless, we must be clear about the meaning of the equivalence.

359
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,519
Now he's going to take it back, I think.

360
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:27,119
It is not the I am which is preeminently contained in the I think.

361
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,680
This is one of these sort of founding claims.

362
00:35:30,319 --> 00:35:38,800
That is, you don't find out whether you're in love or not, or who you are, what the location is, by thinking about it.

363
00:35:39,439 --> 00:35:51,040
Not my existence, which is brought down to consciousness, which I have of it, but conversely, the I think, which is reintegrated into the transcending process of the I am and consciousness into existence.

364
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:56,879
So the claim is that you don't find out that this kind of cogito can't get you the answer.

365
00:35:56,879 --> 00:36:04,800
So if you throw yourself into it, this kind of cogito is how you find out who you are.

366
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:12,240
I thought I had a place where it said I'm amazed that it could turn out to be wrong.

367
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,119
Jeebu, did I miss it in my notes?

368
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,400
Maybe I erased the glass.

369
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:21,920
Have I read anywhere where you could still be mistaken?

370
00:36:22,879 --> 00:36:24,079
I'm sure he thinks so.

371
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,999
She said it somewhere.

372
00:36:25,999 --> 00:36:26,720
I don't know where.

373
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,519
I lost it.

374
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:32,359
But anyway, you can be mistaken always because it likes in perception.

375
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:41,160
You're always, there's always more what it is to be the lover of so-and-so or to have the vocation of being a monk than you will ever experience.

376
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:56,280
And you can just, so to speak, keep making it explicit, as he calls it in some places, you know, money where you say it, but you can keep living it and working it out, and you may just come to some place where you discover that it wasn't what you thought it was.

377
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:03,160
And then you have to give it up, or it explodes like the house when you go around and it turns out to be a facade.

378
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,680
That's what he thinks.

379
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:10,040
Now, finally, the transparency of thought.

380
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:17,959
I skipped that altogether, but now I think we need it because that's the strongest story about founding.

381
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:23,880
The best, the best, so now that was already about founding, what I just said.

382
00:37:23,879 --> 00:37:36,040
Notice that your sort of indubitable feelings are never inner objects and are always subject to finding out more about them by plunging into them.

383
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:40,519
And the plunging into them, the I am is more basic than the I think.

384
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:43,480
That's a founding claim about feeling.

385
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:52,359
Now, so the Cartesian person then says, yeah, the really rockdown thing, I'm the bottom thing that I'm sure of is my thinking.

386
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:59,000
And my thinking and reflecting is going to turn out not to be founded in this.

387
00:37:58,999 --> 00:38:01,319
He's not going to claim that this is founded in this.

388
00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:03,559
I mean, Carlo Day, they just don't care about this.

389
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:08,680
But the issue is about: could this stuff really require this?

390
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:13,680
And then he goes into this whole thing to try to prove it.

391
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:19,680
And the argument seems to be: well, you can't do, let's take doing arithmetic.

392
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,319
Let's take doing things with a triangle.

393
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:32,319
That looks like the most sort of disembodied certainty about the a priori properties of an ideal object.

394
00:38:32,319 --> 00:38:33,679
It has no background.

395
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,200
It doesn't need any history.

396
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:40,800
You can just write it all on the board in swivels, and every other rational being can understand it.

397
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,880
The whole Cartesian picture.

398
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:45,120
And then he has his own view about that.

399
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:49,039
And it's always about intuition is more basic than thought.

400
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:51,600
It's all on page 448.

401
00:38:51,919 --> 00:39:11,280
And what it amounts to is: if you can't experience what he calls physiogamy of the gestalt, it's about 15 lines down, of say that you won't be able to understand the formal definition of a triangle.

402
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,640
And you won't be able to discover anything interesting.

403
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:25,119
I suppose it's like if I told you that a circle is a closed figure, every point of which is equidistant from the center, but you didn't picture a circle.

404
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:29,120
You just tried to use that formal definition.

405
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:43,920
Well, that's not going to help you try to draw certain, you know, like things through the center of it, things parallel to the periphery of it, and all the constructions you can make to find out things about a circle.

406
00:39:43,919 --> 00:39:50,800
And the whole thing, he says, that you need them, the middle of the very middle of the page, the circumstances of discovery.

407
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:57,680
And so he says a little lower down, on the right, formal thought feeds on intuitive thought.

408
00:39:57,999 --> 00:40:13,000
And the idea of the idea of the idea is something like you could formalize all this and do it on a computer, but until you have an intuition about circles and triangles, you won't be able to find out anything new or interesting about them.

409
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:17,480
And I don't know if it's true or not, but that's what he's going to claim.

410
00:40:17,479 --> 00:40:21,879
And so he says a little below about informative and intuitive thought.

411
00:40:21,879 --> 00:40:34,680
But in reality, the place in which certainty arises and in which a truth makes its appearance is always intuitive thought, even though, or rather precisely because the principles are tacitly assumed here.

412
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,959
Now, I don't know if that's convincing.

413
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:45,560
I don't know if it's in it, but it's certainly his important move to make the last foundational move here.

414
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:55,080
At the bottom, the construction relates then to the configuration of the triangle, to the way in which it occupies space, to the relations expressed by all these other things.

415
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:59,800
Do these relations constitute a kind of material essence of the triangle?

416
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:15,319
And then he goes on, well, the triangle has to be, three lines down on the next page, at least potentially situated in my perceptual field, oriented and up and down and right and left, and implied in my general grip on the world.

417
00:41:15,879 --> 00:41:19,720
So he's going to pull it over here into his grip story.

418
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:25,879
Again, I don't think it's important to try to defend it so much as just to see that he's doing it.

419
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,159
Yeah.

420
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:27,879
Really?

421
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,000
William Schneider doesn't have this.

422
00:41:30,999 --> 00:41:35,160
So the point is that intuitive thoughts, well, formal thoughts feeds on intuitive thought.

423
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:35,319
Yeah.

424
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:45,039
Schneider, this peculiar kind of way of thinking of things that lacks the intuitive, digital holistic way of thinking.

425
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:51,359
So Schneider lacks kind of the perceptual stuff that he's got, but he also lacks the intellectual capacity.

426
00:41:51,359 --> 00:42:00,560
But what he's left with is this kind of crude, intellectualist kind of way of thinking, which is precisely his biggest and it's abnormal.

427
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,199
Yeah, and it misses the meaning of what's going on.

428
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:20,479
But okay, I guess it's important for me to show, though, that a Cartesian mathematician, not a brain-injured person, who you might think somehow could do this formal thing without the intuitions, can't do it.

429
00:42:20,479 --> 00:42:31,839
I mean, the argument is, even if mathematician is like Schneider, if this mathematician would try to do the mathematics without founding it in the intuition, it's the same point.

430
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,680
I don't think I'm disagreeing.

431
00:42:34,479 --> 00:42:38,160
I want to, I think, yes, that's right.

432
00:42:38,399 --> 00:42:48,720
In the background, those who know Kant, it's remembering Kant, without an intuition of space, you can't do geometry, and without an intuition of time, you can't do arithmetic.

433
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:53,599
Because you can't even count, except insofar as you have an intuition of time.

434
00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:07,600
But with a certain change, which is interesting, he's going to put it in terms, wouldn't you know it, of our grip on the world, the middle of 49, a little below.

435
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:18,080
Thus, I grasp the concrete essence of the triangle, which is not a collection of objective characteristics, but the formula of an attitude, a certain modality of my hold on the world.

436
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:24,319
The hold is, that's not a mistranslation, but hold is just another word for grip that he's talking about.

437
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:32,040
And skipping a little, insofar as the triangle was implicated in my hold on the world, it was bursting with indefinite possibilities.

438
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:35,640
That's what the person figures out.

439
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:40,359
And finally, just the punchline is supposed to be 50 lines down on 450.

440
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:43,800
The subject of geometry is a motorcycle.

441
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,079
Well, bomb.

442
00:43:45,879 --> 00:44:08,919
That means he's going to take the Cartesian subject of geometry over here and say, basically, that is, you could, without a body and without a maximum grip on the world and all the stuff that goes with it, and intuition, you couldn't be the kind of thinker that Descartes thinks you essentially are and could be whether you had a body or not.

443
00:44:08,919 --> 00:44:10,919
You know, Descartes explicitly thinks you.

444
00:44:11,479 --> 00:44:14,439
And finally, that's half the argument.

445
00:44:14,439 --> 00:44:25,079
The other half, remember, I smuggled in on purpose, and what geometers deal with are essences of triangles, eternal characteristics of triangles.

446
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:42,359
Well, Naropunchi takes that on on 458 and 459, where he says, in effect, that there's a cultural institutional background that's assumed when you do geometry.

447
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:54,920
And in the middle of 458, so for a long time, people did Euclidean geometry, and they thought that all of the, what do you call it, axioms could be taken for granted.

448
00:44:54,919 --> 00:45:03,480
And then it turned out that you could doubt the parallel postulate, and you could cancel it, and then you could make non-Euclidean geometry.

449
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:32,480
And then it turned out further that Euclidean geometry wasn't even the geometry of our physical space, that it was non-Euclidean and so forth, which for him shows that if you were doing geometry in the first place, you were taking this whole traditional background about what you can question and what you can't question for granted until somebody came along and questioned a piece of the background and then everything got changed.

450
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:41,359
That's supposed to show that what you're doing over here is always presupposing a background that's become, in his language, sedimented.

451
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:45,199
It's become just taken for granted in the practices over here.

452
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,040
So I'll just need to do a quick one.

453
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:56,960
Where about 20 lines down in 458, Euclidean geometry is one day revealed as operative for a certain period in history.

454
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:03,839
And it's there's the ground of the thoughts of these people, ground underline.

455
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:17,920
And to assume unquestionably what generalized science will come to consider as a contingent account of space, that's they assume as necessary the old geometries, which turns out now to look like a contingent.

456
00:46:17,919 --> 00:46:22,079
So thus every truth of fact is a truth of reason and vice versa.

457
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:29,839
That means you have what looks like something that is a necessary thing is really a historical view.

458
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:31,839
And now what's the right thing?

459
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,160
I'm not going to try to explain that one.

460
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,599
Maybe it'll get clearer.

461
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:35,999
Let's see.

462
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:43,599
The relation of reason to fact or eternity to time, life of reflection to the unreflective, or thought to language.

463
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,839
Notice, by the way, this is a very important passage.

464
00:46:45,999 --> 00:46:48,959
This is going to sum up all the founders.

465
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:50,399
Okay.

466
00:46:50,399 --> 00:46:52,479
Back of reason to fact.

467
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:55,839
Reason is here, turns out to be founded on facts over here.

468
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:58,600
Fact meaning now is sedimented history.

469
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:02,120
Eternity to time, eternity is these essences.

470
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:03,239
Time is over here.

471
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:10,200
Life, reflection, and the unreflective, reflection here, or of thought to language.

472
00:47:10,839 --> 00:47:12,839
That's interesting.

473
00:47:12,839 --> 00:47:19,079
He wants to say that he wants to put language over here as a bodily thing.

474
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,199
We didn't talk about that.

475
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,879
The reasons you have to make.

476
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,160
I'm not going to get into that one.

477
00:47:23,959 --> 00:47:26,119
It's like the intuitive triangle in here.

478
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,519
Yes, the intuitive things here, but how about language?

479
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:29,559
Intuitive language.

480
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,839
The intuitive language.

481
00:47:30,839 --> 00:47:31,400
Okay.

482
00:47:31,399 --> 00:47:38,600
Thought to language or thought to perception is a two-way relationship that phenomenology is called founding.

483
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:53,160
The founding term or originator, time over here, the unreflective, the fact, language, perception is primary in the sense that the originated is presented as determinant or exclusive form of the originator.

484
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,079
This is the originated.

485
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,599
This is the originator.

486
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,839
I'm in the middle of 458.

487
00:47:58,839 --> 00:48:00,999
So this is just catching in all this.

488
00:48:01,959 --> 00:48:04,359
All the middle part of 458.

489
00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:09,959
Yeah, pundeum is in italic.

490
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,800
And vice versa.

491
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,240
A little before.

492
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:16,999
So is primary in the sense that the originator is seen.

493
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,319
There's the latter from the absorbing or former.

494
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:23,159
Yet the originator is not primary in the empiricist sense.

495
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,439
That is not.

496
00:48:24,439 --> 00:48:27,880
And the originated is not simply derived from it.

497
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,680
And that's got to do with how this is a background for this.

498
00:48:32,999 --> 00:48:36,999
And that's the whole argument, I think.

499
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:38,359
Let me see 440.

500
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,879
450.

501
00:48:39,879 --> 00:48:40,919
I want to do one more.

502
00:48:40,919 --> 00:48:42,200
450.

503
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,599
Middle, a little below the middle.

504
00:48:43,399 --> 00:48:48,640
Whatever I think or decide is always against the background of what has been previously believed or done.

505
00:48:49,280 --> 00:49:00,080
Then there's the Latin, whatever, that we possess a truth, but the experience of truth would be absolute knowledge only if we schematized every motive and so forth.

506
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,120
I don't think we need to grab it again.

507
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,280
No, that's fine.

508
00:49:05,999 --> 00:49:07,839
Just 50 lines down in 461.

509
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,000
You just get used to these things coming back.

510
00:49:09,999 --> 00:49:25,520
Even self-evident proof, I didn't say even, but I'm going to say even self-evident proof, which is irresistible in fact, like geometry before the non-euclidic one, is always questionable.

511
00:49:25,519 --> 00:50:17,000
So the indubitable, certainly all the proofs of eucalyptus were indubitable, turns out always still questionable and that something could come along and show that what seems certain what seems certain and indubitable and was as certain and indubitable as anything could be wasn't something you didn't you could you might have to take back uh well let's see that's the other for this well then it gets named the tacit code did I start with that and so I don't need it again yes so that's it final temporality no yeah I can't just go on that's true okay but yeah I skipped something isn't it amazing you can't get away with it I try to take some quick and dirty road and instantly I get into trouble it's on page 471, I believe.

512
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:17,959
460.

513
00:50:18,359 --> 00:50:19,399
Where's the sediment?

514
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:25,400
I'm looking for the on the right-hand side near the bottom where it talks about.

515
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,960
Okay, here it is, I think.

516
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:28,919
Got it.

517
00:50:28,919 --> 00:50:33,480
459, starting at this paragraph.

518
00:50:33,479 --> 00:50:38,359
We are now in a position to make up our minds about the question of evidence to describe the experience of truth.

519
00:50:38,359 --> 00:50:41,559
There are no truths, just as there are.

520
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,280
There are truths, just as there are perceptions.

521
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:50,119
Not that we have to array before ourselves in their entirety the reasons for any assertion.

522
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,760
Then skipping about five lines from the bottom.

523
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,520
We should always find experiences which have not been made explicit.

524
00:50:56,519 --> 00:51:06,680
Large-scale contributions from past and present, a whole sedimented history, which is not only relevant to the genesis of my thought, but which determines its significance.

525
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:10,280
Is that any answer to your question if not repeated?

526
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:10,679
What?

527
00:51:11,319 --> 00:51:33,319
Well, we did in both columns, all right, but it has to, the more basic is in this column, because whatever is explicit over here only seems meaningful and true and certain because it's taking for granted a background from over here.

528
00:51:33,319 --> 00:51:35,160
You can't go the other way.

529
00:51:35,479 --> 00:51:36,919
Supposed to be a good point.

530
00:51:36,919 --> 00:51:37,240
Yeah.

531
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,519
Can you two?

532
00:51:38,839 --> 00:51:39,560
Yes.

533
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,959
Sedimental history definitely is over here.

534
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:42,919
That's right.

535
00:51:43,319 --> 00:51:47,640
And background is that that's part of the event's potions in the argument.

536
00:51:47,879 --> 00:51:50,839
Background, and that means sedimented history.

537
00:51:50,839 --> 00:51:55,640
And that means that's expanding the notion of the volume a lot.

538
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:59,240
I think the sedimented history gets to be part of the motor intentionality.

539
00:51:59,399 --> 00:52:02,519
It's the way the geometer is going to look at the triangle.

540
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:02,919
Yeah.

541
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:04,519
Right, so I mean, I'm saying this point.

542
00:52:04,519 --> 00:52:07,720
Some of you previously said that they've been follow native practices.

543
00:52:07,879 --> 00:52:15,760
And there's like a guy here, I've been scratching my head and talking about practices, but now I feel like I get why you say that, and I think you're actually right.

544
00:52:13,479 --> 00:52:23,119
Oh, well, but the way that you just part of the text is good, because you never talk about practices, and you have to make thinking of it.

545
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:27,839
But where practices are, so to speak, and the low-find feeling is in the body.

546
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:33,039
And so that's why, you know, distance standing I like to use as an example of practices behind.

547
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:34,079
But that's body.

548
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:34,720
That's right.

549
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,280
That's good.

550
00:52:36,399 --> 00:52:36,720
Good.

551
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:41,999
And that's where tension has come up in this marginal way where, you know, you just sit drawing closer or farther away to each other.

552
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:42,399
Good.

553
00:52:42,399 --> 00:52:43,599
Remember the word?

554
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,839
I came across it this morning, rereading it.

555
00:52:47,439 --> 00:53:04,480
Practinosia, not agnosia, but practinosia or something like that, is the understanding, the we are practinosia, he says, which is sort of have an understanding of our practices as a kind of knowledge.

556
00:53:04,479 --> 00:53:07,440
It's a fancy word for know-how, I guess.

557
00:53:07,439 --> 00:53:08,720
Something like that.

558
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,319
Anyway, you're good.

559
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:11,520
Put that in there.

560
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:15,039
Now, before you tune it in things, yeah.

561
00:53:18,479 --> 00:53:21,359
More of us results are the age.

562
00:53:21,919 --> 00:53:23,839
It's through the originated.

563
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,640
That's what we just.

564
00:53:24,879 --> 00:53:26,639
Through the originated.

565
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,319
Yes, I can see that.

566
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:31,280
It's through this that this is made manifest.

567
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:40,080
Yeah, yeah, I think that's right.

568
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:45,599
It's only by reflection and talk about it.

569
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,399
Yes, but manifest is the crucial word.

570
00:53:48,399 --> 00:53:54,240
I mean, this exists independently and could exist whether it was ever made manifest or not.

571
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,399
But it's true that only from over here can you talk about this.

572
00:53:58,519 --> 00:54:02,600
Of course, that begins to raise this terrible question again, which we're not going to talk about.

573
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,960
How this can make this manifest without distorting it.

574
00:54:05,959 --> 00:54:12,520
Because then it it's this issue of you don't want to come up with the view that I think can accompany it in representation.

575
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:18,359
That's the Kantian view he's against, because every time you think it, you may well be changing it.

576
00:54:18,359 --> 00:54:24,440
So somehow something like this is necessary to manifest this.

577
00:54:24,439 --> 00:54:26,519
But I I don't know what to say about that.

578
00:54:26,519 --> 00:54:28,279
But some kind of A without B.

579
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,399
Could you have A without B?

580
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,280
I think you could.

581
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:34,120
I mean, if if not, I have gotten absolutely wrong.

582
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,839
I don't see why you couldn't have all this without this.

583
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:40,999
But but not with not with language and all this other stuff.

584
00:54:40,999 --> 00:54:42,599
Well, he put language over here.

585
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,800
I know, but that's the whole point.

586
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:48,920
I know, but but now I thought you that there are two kinds of language according to him.

587
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:55,400
There's this embodied kind of language which you're going to put over here and a kind of formal language which you're going to put over here.

588
00:54:55,399 --> 00:55:01,959
And then you're going to claim again that this is more basic than this, that all the meaning and the formal comes from over here.

589
00:55:02,359 --> 00:55:11,399
Technically the way Wilhelm here presents it is that language is kind of I guess you would say it on the A side and then on the spot is kind of what happens.

590
00:55:11,399 --> 00:55:21,319
But like Descartes didn't see the relation between language and and now I mean are we going to say that I wouldn't say there's intuitive language and then not intuitive language is that there's language and then there's thought.

591
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:29,959
Okay, and so the problem is is is reconciling set of into disagree practices and all that easy stuff without any deflections on that.

592
00:55:30,439 --> 00:55:34,119
And you have the claim is, I mean, that's the founding claim.

593
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,240
You could have this.

594
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,000
And of course, now you're getting more and more taking in stuff over here.

595
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,439
It might have been over here.

596
00:55:40,439 --> 00:55:46,080
But you make up a a kind of this, which you could have without this.

597
00:55:46,399 --> 00:55:58,000
And you define this in a sufficiently formal, intellectualist, background-free, Cartesian way so that you can't have this without that.

598
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,439
That is the thesis, isn't it?

599
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,839
Let me refrain from the different questions.

600
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:04,479
Okay.

601
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:11,440
The temptation is to say, well, you can have something just like A without B, and that's what children and animals are.

602
00:56:11,439 --> 00:56:12,079
What?

603
00:56:12,479 --> 00:56:13,199
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

604
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,159
Okay, yeah, got it.

605
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:14,560
Okay.

606
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,599
And children and animals.

607
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:20,000
And that's the view that I think we'll often see.

608
00:56:19,999 --> 00:56:25,519
Yeah, I think I read something in here, too, as well, in the primacy of perception where he said, it does particular things in the value.

609
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,200
I mean, it's just high degree.

610
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:28,319
Yes.

611
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:28,879
But...

612
00:56:28,879 --> 00:56:31,999
That you can't even say animals are like us without X, point, and Z, which we have.

613
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:32,399
Okay.

614
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,680
I can see you want to say that when once we say that.

615
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,760
But then there's...

616
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,800
Boy, that's interesting.

617
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,839
See, that's why I wrote the column I wrote and not that.

618
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:50,159
Because in this column, this is what we share with the animals and the pre-linguistic.

619
00:56:50,479 --> 00:56:55,999
This is something that we have to have that go beyond the animation.

620
00:56:55,999 --> 00:57:02,080
But I hope you can pull this out of Rick, because if you do, it'll be a great step forward.

621
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,359
What's left of the founding?

622
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:09,359
What does founding mean once you've made this a prerequisite of this?

623
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:16,959
I think it's what we talked about in office in your office, something along the lines of enabling conditioning, or this point of conditions or the experience of existence and mentability.

624
00:57:16,999 --> 00:57:22,399
I mean, I mean, I actually don't know, but I feel like there's just a holistic transformation of our existence.

625
00:57:22,399 --> 00:57:25,839
It can be easy just as an instructive behavior in other ways.

626
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:31,240
And so, once we're like the way we are, our perception is whatever it is distinct from animals.

627
00:57:32,039 --> 00:57:33,159
Well, I don't deny it.

628
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:33,959
That's fine.

629
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,079
I mean, except I don't understand you anymore.

630
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:40,599
The stance in which this is supposed to be founding for this.

631
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:47,240
I think it's a problem, but then graphs, you have to clarify what he means by conditions of existence and instability and everything.

632
00:57:47,479 --> 00:57:54,199
Okay, but still, there's certainly this logical space for that differentiation because this arises out of that.

633
00:57:54,359 --> 00:57:56,999
You might think it arises out of this method therapy.

634
00:57:56,999 --> 00:57:57,319
Right.

635
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:04,359
So that you couldn't have all of those pieces together without having the other forms of life that are impossible behind that altogether.

636
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:07,559
Like you can't have three dots without having a triangle.

637
00:58:07,879 --> 00:58:15,079
So the story would be that this is founded in this genetically.

638
00:58:15,479 --> 00:58:18,760
Without this already in place, you can't get this.

639
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:25,560
But once you've got this, then there's more to this, namely what we put over here.

640
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:36,839
And but even this more over here is a prerequisite of a certain kind of intellectual activity over here.

641
00:58:36,839 --> 00:58:38,439
Boy, is that complicated.

642
00:58:39,399 --> 00:58:48,279
It is, but let's repeat it because it seems to be stupid individual pieces of hair.

643
00:58:48,439 --> 00:58:52,359
Individual pieces of hair are more basic than overall hair is.

644
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:57,480
But once you've stipulated the individual pieces of the hair, you've also stipulated the hair.

645
00:59:02,519 --> 00:59:06,839
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I don't think it's ingredient, but I think it's genetic.

646
00:59:06,839 --> 00:59:13,800
I think it's only because, because that's got to do, well, we're getting, I think this is fascinating and important.

647
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:23,839
Let me just repeat what I said because it's the nearest thing I can think of to understanding it right now, but it sounds so complicated that I'm going to go over it slowly and maybe have to take it back.

648
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:42,800
It looks like there's this story which I'm always telling, which is infants and higher primates and the body schema that's in us, and any being that has a body like ours that's coming to be with this, get onto the way objects are in the world and so forth.

649
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:48,160
And that's certainly going to turn out to have to be in place before you get this.

650
00:59:48,479 --> 01:00:07,679
But this can then generate, and this is the genetic thing, language and history and institutions and background, and they aren't for pre-linguists, just they call beyond pre-linguists.

651
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:16,400
They make possible something over here which you couldn't have had if you didn't have this.

652
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,560
But now there's one more thing.

653
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,640
So, oh, I know what I said wrong.

654
01:00:20,959 --> 01:00:21,999
Let me start again.

655
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:23,599
That's not the way to put it.

656
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,279
Otherwise, that won't be any pleasant.

657
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:37,519
So you get this, and then you get some kind of this, which makes what happens when, and maybe that's the supervenience.

658
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:52,879
You get something like, I don't know yet, you got when the child gets to a certain point, it's able to learn language and think and reflect, and the kind of thing the Alice and Doffnik and so forth study.

659
01:00:52,879 --> 01:00:56,760
You see, see that you have a perspective on the world.

660
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:00,040
Then that makes possible this.

661
01:01:00,039 --> 01:01:00,839
Okay, I see now.

662
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:03,080
I want to say this, you get first.

663
01:01:03,399 --> 01:01:06,760
You can go, human beings can go to this.

664
01:01:07,399 --> 01:01:10,280
That makes possible this.

665
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:18,359
It makes possible something over here for things like geometry.

666
01:01:18,359 --> 01:01:29,240
But that is what this kind of background enables you to do, I guess I could say, one of the things, disembodied.

667
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,639
How is your number four different from your number two?

668
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,319
From number two.

669
01:01:33,959 --> 01:01:37,720
Well, that's, now I'd have to sort of figure that out.

670
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:46,520
You'd have to say, well, a three-year-old child has something like a kind of thought, a kind of reflection, and represents they have beliefs.

671
01:01:46,519 --> 01:01:51,640
This is all the stuff that the developmental people study that come in at three.

672
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,160
And that stuff.

673
01:01:53,479 --> 01:01:59,479
Yeah, I think that they have beliefs the way that those people think that they have beliefs.

674
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:00,839
No, not the way they think.

675
01:02:00,839 --> 01:02:01,720
The beliefs.

676
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:04,679
Everything over here is going to be up for fighting over.

677
01:02:04,839 --> 01:02:06,039
Isn't the way they think of it?

678
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,439
They can play to and book.

679
01:02:08,439 --> 01:02:10,520
And isn't that what you're against?

680
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:11,239
That's right.

681
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:11,800
They do.

682
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:14,359
We're now trying to tell the true story of founding.

683
01:02:14,359 --> 01:02:17,400
The true story of founding is you get this.

684
01:02:17,399 --> 01:02:22,920
At a certain age, let's say three-year-old children get a certain version of this.

685
01:02:23,479 --> 01:02:25,160
They've got beliefs, all right.

686
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:35,400
They just don't, and they've got thinking and they've got reflection, but all in a very uncritesian-detached sort of way.

687
01:02:35,399 --> 01:02:42,040
But that's enough to give them this, which they've got as they grow up.

688
01:02:42,039 --> 01:02:46,319
And on the basis of this, you can get the much more Cartesian.

689
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:51,280
So I'm going to have to move the Cartesian toe over here.

690
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,399
That's what we want me to do.

691
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:56,879
And this is going to be something what?

692
01:02:56,879 --> 01:03:01,039
The pre-reflective Coke-toe, the no, the exact reflection.

693
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:02,319
The developmental.

694
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:04,159
I don't know what to say.

695
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,200
The linguistic Cokey Toe.

696
01:03:07,439 --> 01:03:08,720
We haven't got a word for it.

697
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:09,919
The one?

698
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:14,879
I don't know what to say.

699
01:03:14,879 --> 01:03:16,800
The question mark Coke-Toe.

700
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:19,039
Well, that might be the story.

701
01:03:21,439 --> 01:03:22,560
The I think.

702
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:24,480
The I think.

703
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:35,599
Well, there's going to be a kind of I think which children have, and then there's going to be a kind of much more building role.

704
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:46,159
So for the record, this is for the record, this is your understanding of what's really happening, but would you attribute this to the Mobile Frontier as well?

705
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:51,039
Well, no, I think, yes.

706
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:55,999
I mean, I think not, I think, I don't know whether he sees it, but you've convinced me this whole discussion.

707
01:03:55,999 --> 01:04:07,599
It's just you he's got to hold once he puts this in here as over here on this side and says that this is required.

708
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:08,959
What's the manifest quote?

709
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:09,760
Who said that?

710
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:15,200
Yeah, the the something here is required to manifest this.

711
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,359
And now the whole thing would be to sort this out.

712
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:18,159
Shall we try?

713
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,080
I mean, I don't know what it looked like.

714
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,839
This guy thinks this is in general as Aaron.

715
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:28,920
This doesn't, and this is representational intentionality.

716
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,839
That's going to go over here.

717
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:33,800
But there's going to be something over here like beliefs.

718
01:04:33,959 --> 01:04:38,040
It's just that they're not going to be understood in that intellectualist way.

719
01:04:38,039 --> 01:04:39,560
There's going to be reflection.

720
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,000
There's going to be thought.

721
01:04:40,999 --> 01:04:42,999
That's going to be formal thinking over.

722
01:04:42,999 --> 01:04:47,560
This is going to be something like intuitive thinking over here.

723
01:04:49,879 --> 01:04:53,079
And disengage.

724
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,599
This is supposed to be really disengage.

725
01:04:56,999 --> 01:04:58,280
What is this supposed to be?

726
01:04:58,519 --> 01:04:59,399
I don't know.

727
01:04:59,959 --> 01:05:01,560
There's got to be a way.

728
01:05:01,879 --> 01:05:04,999
And this is the thing that Jennifer started by talking about.

729
01:05:04,999 --> 01:05:06,039
We're back to that.

730
01:05:06,039 --> 01:05:16,200
There's a kind of disengage, which goes with staying on the level of a background of coping when you're dealing with the doorknob.

731
01:05:16,519 --> 01:05:18,599
And then there's this total disengage.

732
01:05:18,919 --> 01:05:28,839
This is supposed to be the total disengaged theoretical with Descartes supposedly home.

733
01:05:28,839 --> 01:05:33,559
This kind of disengaged is something like practical disengage.

734
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:38,919
For those who know Heidegger, this is going to be the unready, and this is going to be the present inherent.

735
01:05:38,919 --> 01:05:46,680
Now, I don't know how much of that is in Narva Ponte, and I don't even know if it's right, but the vision was sort of driven into, yeah.

736
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,439
Okay, I find this very confusing.

737
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:56,119
And in particular, I don't see that you can do with column three what you're, what it seems like wants to be done with column three here.

738
01:05:56,439 --> 01:06:06,679
One thing that I can make sense of, which is what I thought you were saying all semester long, was that stuff like, maybe background is okay, but stuff like practices and history just don't belong over on our side because they're not impersonal.

739
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:10,440
Okay, but now that we know what Nario Fonti said, history belongs there.

740
01:06:10,439 --> 01:06:18,959
Well, okay, so then if you want to, if you want to say that and you want to stick all that stuff over there then I think that all that stuff has to be in one column.

741
01:06:18,959 --> 01:06:24,800
You sort of have two columns over on that on that side and then you don't get any of the stuff on the B side until you've got all of that.

742
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:25,760
Well, I don't see why you're not.

743
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,639
Well we know that Marlowapanti doesn't say that.

744
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,560
One, he does say history's here.

745
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:38,559
Second, he says that this is something that we share with the pre-linguistic infants and with the animals.

746
01:06:38,959 --> 01:06:48,240
It's the one that functions in anybody, that any kind of body that deals with perceptual objects and keeps them constant and so forth.

747
01:06:48,240 --> 01:07:00,400
And it's definitely, I mean, I didn't sort of bring them in today, the quotes, but you can find plenty of quotes that it's not social, not linguistic, and so forth.

748
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,040
And he's analyzing that a lot of the time.

749
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,880
So you can't just get rid of it.

750
01:07:05,439 --> 01:07:20,000
So no, this doesn't mean history of events, and it doesn't mean history of being or anything like that.

751
01:07:19,999 --> 01:07:29,199
Sedimented, sedimented, but it does mean more than just this.

752
01:07:29,519 --> 01:07:33,280
So but what columns into the A side?

753
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,559
What is it that the things include grouping everything?

754
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:42,800
This they have in common not being either of those two and being a necessary condition for both of them.

755
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,240
Okay, so founding.

756
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,600
Everything on the left side is founding.

757
01:07:45,999 --> 01:07:48,879
This is the founder, and this is the founded.

758
01:07:48,879 --> 01:07:49,440
Definitely.

759
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,079
That's what it is that's.

760
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,439
It doesn't seem that uncomplicated because what you say is first you get one, and then you get two, and then you get three.

761
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,760
So that sounds like two is founding for three.

762
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:59,319
Yes, I see.

763
01:07:59,320 --> 01:07:59,800
You're right.

764
01:08:00,279 --> 01:08:00,600
That's right.

765
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:01,800
So I can't put it that way.

766
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:07,399
I've got to say that this is all because of the complications about the word founding, right?

767
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,559
But what you're saying is true.

768
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:16,919
It looks like there's a founding relation between this and this.

769
01:08:17,239 --> 01:08:35,560
And then, and that's the thing that Jin started, something about this is required for this, and yet, and now back to the founding of a different sort again, that that is going to be background and founding for this.

770
01:08:35,879 --> 01:08:37,640
That's just how it's going to turn out.

771
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:42,680
And then my question is: why don't you just put everything in column three, you know, in column two or after column two?

772
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:45,480
Why is it back over on this basic set?

773
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:51,959
Because it's got, it's pre-reflective, and it's the body.

774
01:08:53,879 --> 01:09:00,999
Reflection is required, compliance, but certainly the background is pre-reflective when it's functioning as a background.

775
01:09:00,999 --> 01:09:04,279
Maybe we have to worry about what reflection means here.

776
01:09:05,079 --> 01:09:08,359
I think it probably is this kind of reflection.

777
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:15,560
This is not the reflection of disembodied theoretical reflection.

778
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:19,559
This is something like reflection in practice.

779
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,720
And that's again like the ready to hand.

780
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:27,800
It's like in the activity of dealing with the door, how am I going to deal with the doorknob?

781
01:09:28,119 --> 01:09:31,640
Kids have that before they, probably before language.

782
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:44,720
But this kind of practical reflection is going to be what is required already before you can get this.

783
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:49,600
But this may be prior to practical reflection.

784
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:50,159
I think it is.

785
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:57,839
I think it's either you're coping or there's breakdown in which you're sort of flailing around.

786
01:09:57,839 --> 01:10:12,559
If you stop flailing around, flailing around flexibly and creatively, I don't mean falling apart, but if you get into the position of sort of figuring out what to do, you're over here.

787
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:19,919
And if you get into the position of sort of standing back completely and trying to have a theory what to do, you're over there.

788
01:10:19,919 --> 01:10:22,319
Hey, you're stuck is much better.

789
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,199
But let me see.

790
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:24,319
Sediment and what?

791
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,919
What did you want to do with history?

792
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:38,800
I think instead of calling it with history, I wasn't there to say that it's sedimentation and that means Martin's your learning history and reduced behind the state.

793
01:10:38,959 --> 01:10:39,760
It doesn't exist.

794
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:41,039
Let's look.

795
01:10:41,039 --> 01:10:44,319
I thought it was something like the institutions came into it.

796
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,520
Where did I find this sediment?

797
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:46,800
A hill yard.

798
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,600
It's a large-scale contribution to the past.

799
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:55,039
I hope it hasn't the genesis of thought, it turns it beyond the bottom of 59.

800
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:02,479
Now we think against the background, just the middle of 60.

801
01:11:03,839 --> 01:11:05,839
So I know what he's thinking about.

802
01:11:05,839 --> 01:11:16,800
He's thinking about how the book for historical, the origin of geometry is the origin of certain institutions and background taken for granted.

803
01:11:16,879 --> 01:11:22,800
It may mean something very different in hostil, but this is the area he's in.

804
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:23,999
So, what do you think?

805
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:25,199
Why don't you describe it?

806
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:31,239
Also, Columbus when he speaks about headaches for the depth of the body right.

807
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:36,519
But a seven-minute history is a different thing, I think.

808
01:11:37,079 --> 01:11:47,720
I'm trying to see if it isn't in the examples that you hear about geometry and what you take for granted when you're doing geometry.

809
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:56,599
It's got to do with what stands behind having a true idea at the middle of forests, and having eigenic intuitions.

810
01:11:56,600 --> 01:12:01,720
So, it's not just any, it's not just all the skills that you've got that you didn't have.

811
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:06,760
I mean, it doesn't mean to hear a seven-minute history certainly doesn't mean that I can play tennis.

812
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:08,919
It's much more institutional.

813
01:12:08,919 --> 01:12:10,839
But I don't know how to say it.

814
01:12:18,119 --> 01:12:22,199
I mean, that's probably not sufficiently precise to do it, but it's got to do with that.

815
01:12:22,199 --> 01:12:27,239
It's not about I've learned that makes me my body, but it's what we've all considered.

816
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:30,919
I'm sure I understand the reason for having four separate places.

817
01:12:30,919 --> 01:12:39,720
Why not just say that it is the pretty taken from B, and at once we have the A force background from B and that once?

818
01:12:40,199 --> 01:12:41,400
Well, any thorns?

819
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:45,400
Because why would be the founding character?

820
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:58,839
That yesterday is before we turned against the fact that supposedly the big claim, remember I started the lecture, who would have thought that it would be destroyed by the end of the lecture, but I think that's very important.

821
01:12:59,079 --> 01:13:04,839
The big claim is there are these two capacities, maybe now three, but uh four.

822
01:13:04,879 --> 01:13:15,519
Then look, I started, there are these two capacities, and the important claim isn't that these don't exist, the important claim is that this is founding for this.

823
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,279
And we don't want to lose that.

824
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:17,999
That's it.

825
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:22,319
So that's why I've pushed it the phenomenon supposed to prove that.

826
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:27,520
That is supposed to prove that you can't uh now it's gotta prove two things.

827
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:43,519
I mean, it's gotta prove that without this you couldn't even get this childlike thing going this thing of three-year-olds going and it and and it's gotta prove, I think, that without this you couldn't get geometry going.

828
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,239
And there seem to be, I think, two foundings going on.

829
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:49,359
But if you can straighten it out, I'd be delighted.

830
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:52,560
But what I would also have somebody I hope wrote this chart down.

831
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:56,800
Has somebody got this written down so that I can click at home and think about it?

832
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:57,839
Jennifer, have you got it?

833
01:13:58,800 --> 01:13:59,039
Okay.

834
01:14:01,039 --> 01:14:09,199
Yeah, it's I thought it seems to me that when you know two to three you don't breathe forward, you need to go back to dying.

835
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:14,479
Um you need to get from language to the concept of the geometry.

836
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:18,800
And it seems to me that you have to retire two both founded for you.

837
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:20,239
Well, that's what I'm saying.

838
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:24,159
Yes, that's what I think that you that's why so it's interdependent.

839
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:26,320
You know, it's not just positive change.

840
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:27,680
Interdependent.

841
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:28,640
Very careful.

842
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:29,520
Interdependent.

843
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:32,159
If you go too far with that, you lose founding.

844
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:42,479
I mean, that's the question is how to keep all this interdependence and keep the claim, which is clearly important to Verlofunte, that these are all lined down here.

845
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:48,720
Somehow the stuff over here does a founding job to the stuff over here.

846
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:56,079
And now now you must introduce the complication that this that this part can still do a founding job for this part.

847
01:14:56,079 --> 01:14:58,439
And that makes it hard to understand.

848
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:00,039
Yeah, good word.

849
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:19,640
Maybe feel like a kind of a holistic understanding of it where it is when you when you move to three, it's A and B combined together and when you move from three to four is A and D and one, two, and two combined together, so that you can interchange between the three of them, so it's not going to cause the pain that's turning between them.

850
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:28,600
But because when you do have geometry, you can go back and talk and classes with language and then produce, you know, not the next thing.

851
01:15:28,839 --> 01:15:31,400
I'm not sure I understand you, but we've run out of time.

852
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:36,359
I mean, it's a story about what founding is that we have to get clear, which I'll talk.
