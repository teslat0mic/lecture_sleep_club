1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,281
Okay, now, the punchline of the sense experience chapter, after you've gone through a lot of discussion of whether the senses are all completely the same or completely different, and that's all this talk about whether blind people do or do not experience objects the way people who see them experience it.

2
00:00:19,281 --> 00:00:21,041
That's not the point, really.

3
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,880
The point is sort of the opposite.

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:47,041
He finally comes around to saying, well, though all the senses are different, sort of, in that they give you the world from a different aspect, they are not different in the sense that what you see of an object, its color, say, is unrelated to its shape and its what it's made of and everything.

5
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,881
In fact, what you get is the intersensorial unity of the object.

6
00:00:52,881 --> 00:01:01,361
It's given to you as having a color and shape and texture and made out of material and everything all at once.

7
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:06,400
And that's because we've got this intersensorial unity of the body.

8
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:11,840
And when we perceive something, we don't perceive it with each sense.

9
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,281
That's just the way it looks.

10
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:23,360
If you think about the stimulus error, or that is, of course, something different is coming into the eye, than it's coming into the ear, than it's coming into the hand.

11
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:32,880
But that's, but when we actually experience an object, it's our whole body actively experiencing the whole object.

12
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:36,400
That's why I want to read this because I think that's important.

13
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,520
And that's on 262, let's hope.

14
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,520
The middle of the page.

15
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,000
Sensory experience is unstable and alien to natural perception, which we get feed with our whole body.

16
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:54,880
Sensory experience means seeing as separated from hearing, as separated from touching.

17
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,560
That's not what's natural.

18
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:05,641
What's natural is what we do when we perceive the whole object with our whole body, all at once, opening on the world of interacting senses.

19
00:02:05,801 --> 00:02:07,400
That's the moral of it.

20
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:22,680
Like that, the sensible quality, the experience of the separate senses is gained only when one assumes a particular, highly particularized attitude, and this won't help us in understanding what's going on when we normally perceive that important.

21
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:31,320
Now, if I could just figure out why the other important, because I want a quote way back near the beginning, I think.

22
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,720
Although maybe it's, maybe it really isn't.

23
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:34,521
Yeah.

24
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,241
Why are you, what a surprise I.

25
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,160
Okay, on 376, it's way in the same in the natural world.

26
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:49,161
And it's only a sentence, but I does such a good job there at the bottom of 376, where he says, this sums up this intersensorial thing.

27
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:55,240
It is impossible completely to describe the color of the carpet without saying that it's a carpet made of wool.

28
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,560
Remember, that's the woolly blue story.

29
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:04,361
And without implying in this color a certain tactile value, a certain weight, a certain resilience to sound, and so forth.

30
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:07,400
That's the intersensorial claim.

31
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,041
And that leads him to talk about synesthesia.

32
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:20,440
And what he was going to claim about synesthesia is, which is this experience that we have, which you can see colors and hear sounds and so forth.

33
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:25,640
You get it under mescaline, you get it under sort of the brain problems.

34
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:38,680
But he says on 266, this interesting claim, which sort of follows from his view, that synesthesia, the middle of the page, synesthetic perception is the rule.

35
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:46,801
That is, we normally are able, on 266, that I, at the middle of the page, nor are these exceptional phenomena.

36
00:03:43,641 --> 00:04:10,321
Synesthetic experience is the rule, and we are aware of it only because, unaware of it, only because scientific knowledge shifts the center of gravity of experience, and then we have to unlearn and so forth that we pay attention to our bodily organization and think of how the difference between the physics of how you see and how you hear, for instance.

37
00:04:10,321 --> 00:04:14,321
But the claim that synesthesia is normal, I mentioned this in the past.

38
00:04:14,481 --> 00:04:16,161
I don't know how it is in your life.

39
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:17,761
I don't think I experience it.

40
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:29,280
But the people who now do research on synesthesia say lots of people do, and they can go out and find plenty of subjects, and most people don't talk about it because they think there's something wrong with them, or they're weird.

41
00:04:29,281 --> 00:04:31,521
They don't want to talk about how they see colors.

42
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:36,401
How many of these see sounds or hear colors and so forth?

43
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,041
Is it?

44
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,881
I don't understand why anybody would be afraid to say so.

45
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,080
It wouldn't show you a crazy.

46
00:04:42,641 --> 00:04:44,880
It would just show that Merylo-Ponte is right.

47
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,120
Anyway, now nobody.

48
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,240
Well, you in dreams.

49
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,321
Ah, dreams don't count, I guess.

50
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,921
I mean, I know that these people do it really just in the everyday world.

51
00:04:56,401 --> 00:04:56,961
That's right.

52
00:04:56,961 --> 00:05:11,601
Well, those are the people that they particularly study, because they're very easy to study, and you can do funny things like spell the word red, R-E-D, in letters that are always green to a synesthe and see what happens to them and so forth.

53
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:16,721
Anyway, it would be nice if Merylophanti were right, that we all see like this.

54
00:05:17,361 --> 00:05:21,680
I think probably some painters certainly see like it.

55
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,680
Anyway, that's all I want to say about that so far.

56
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:27,921
Yeah, okay.

57
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:44,361
Now, the last thing I'm going to talk about, being specific, and then I want to talk about his general conclusion, that was his story about binocular vision is really interesting and has sort of lots of little morals of the whole way he does things packed into it.

58
00:05:44,361 --> 00:05:46,761
This starts on 268.

59
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,000
And I've got it all marked up because everything he's saying here seems to be interesting.

60
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,240
Now, what is going on with binocular vision?

61
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,281
What's he talking about?

62
00:05:54,281 --> 00:06:11,721
He's talking about the fact that just to sort of demonstrate it, you can demonstrate it to yourself, if I'm looking at you and my finger is here, I see two fingers, but I see just one of you all, or I can focus on my finger with a little effort, and then you get to be two and blurry.

63
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:23,561
That's just because we see with two eyes, and if you focus those two eyes on the finger, then you get the image on the retinas, two retinas of you guys won't line upright.

64
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:29,081
And if I get the image to line up right for you guys, it won't line up right for my finger.

65
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,961
But he's got a whole account of that, which is very interesting.

66
00:06:33,960 --> 00:07:08,680
He wants, he, or the, the, the, the, the thing he wants to show, let me just say it in my own terms, is that there is the crucial thing, I think, for him is to show that, is to claim that if you start by seeing two things, and you do sometimes because you start out focused wrong, too much onto something near or far, then they come together, but not just instantly, he says, which they would do if it was just a question of calculating what was on each retina and lining it up.

67
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:16,000
Probably they come together instantly in a digital camera, which just looks for the edges and lines them up.

68
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:27,200
But they take a while to come together for us, and that shows that it's not just a mental operation, and it isn't just a causal operation either, he thinks.

69
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:36,000
There's some things that are sort of just going on outside of any relation to our existential involvement.

70
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:51,361
He thinks that it's only when you make an effort and focus your attention, either I try to see you all clearly, or I try to see my finger clearly, when I do that, I can pull the disparate two images together.

71
00:07:51,361 --> 00:08:01,841
And when I pull them together, they don't just superimpose, they disappear into the object, which then looks like it's solid, and these two images just look like ghosts.

72
00:08:01,841 --> 00:08:03,281
So now I'll read you things.

73
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,801
All of that is interesting enough.

74
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:13,280
So this is not 268, he starts talking about this, about five lines down.

75
00:08:13,281 --> 00:08:26,721
Now, though perception brings together our sensory experiences into a single world, it does not do so in the way that scientific collegation gathers together objects, but in a way that binocular vision grasps one soul option.

76
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:29,521
Let us describe carefully this synthesis.

77
00:08:29,521 --> 00:08:32,081
Notice the synthesis has been quotes.

78
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,440
And he does sometimes talk about what he's interested in is synthesis.

79
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:50,161
But it's a very tricky notion because it's usually an intellectualist kind of notion in which there are elements and the mind somehow puts them together, in King Kant's say.

80
00:08:50,161 --> 00:08:57,121
But when he does use synthesis, he means the sort of how the experience self-organizes.

81
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:58,440
And this is the case of that.

82
00:08:58,241 --> 00:09:02,521
You try hard to see, say, whatever it is you're looking at.

83
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:10,840
And when you do, then the experience, somewhat sluggishly but obediently, self-organizes.

84
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,161
That's what he's interested in.

85
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:15,001
So he goes on.

86
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:19,801
When I fix a gaze on a remote thing, I have a double image of the objects nearby.

87
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:23,560
Then you can transfer to objects nearby and so forth.

88
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,921
This is what I just did.

89
00:09:24,921 --> 00:09:31,001
We must not at any point say that the synthesis consists in thinking of them together as images of one object.

90
00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:35,801
It's when we're dealing with a mental act or an apperception, that's what it is.

91
00:09:35,801 --> 00:09:44,200
You thought to occur as soon as I notice the identity of the two images, whereas I have to wait much longer for the unity to appear and so forth.

92
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:50,921
Until the moment when correct focusing does away with the images, that is, the two ghost-like things.

93
00:09:50,921 --> 00:09:57,241
The single object is not a certain way of thinking, the two images cease to be given the moment it appears.

94
00:09:57,241 --> 00:09:59,161
All that sounds right.

95
00:09:59,161 --> 00:10:04,600
And then, from 269, he gives his usual analysis of it.

96
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,041
Now, I think it's just important.

97
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:09,961
It's always important to keep your eye on what he's always going to talk about.

98
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:18,041
And it's always got to do with equilibrium, balance, maximum grip, and tension.

99
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:23,481
That whole picture, which I'm going to give you lots of quotes about in a little while, so don't worry about it yet.

100
00:10:23,481 --> 00:10:27,801
But that's always there, sort of governing what he says.

101
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:35,080
And as Eric pointed out to me, and I wanted to say this to you, I don't think I said it last time, as advice for how to read it, did I say this?

102
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:48,641
If you go to the end of these hard chapters and read the last few paragraphs, usually, you find that that's the punchline, that it's got to do with gaining a maximum grip, getting a balance, lowering a tension, and so forth.

103
00:10:48,960 --> 00:11:13,841
And then you can sort of find your way through these hard chapters by knowing that all of these ways he's heading there are either wrong ways because they ignore it, or hints at somebody who's got a clue about it but hasn't figured it out completely, like the Dishal people who have a notion of balance and unbalance and tension, but don't have it in a properly existentialist way.

104
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:20,561
Because to make it really existential, you have to add, I'm always trying to get a grip.

105
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,561
And that trying part, not consciously trying, my body is always trying.

106
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,081
Something in me is always trying to get an optimal grip.

107
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,761
That's the way I think I got Olivier's agreement on this one, that he really goes beyond Husserl.

108
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:39,361
Olivier and I disagree about a lot how much this is like Husserl.

109
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:46,481
And there's a whole industry trying to decide how much Merlot is like Husserl, partly because he's got lots of claims about that.

110
00:11:46,480 --> 00:12:10,481
But the thing that he considers, I think, his original idea, and which is the underlying idea of all these analyses, is this business of we are constantly, or the body is, or one in me, is trying to get a grip on the world, to find their way about in the world, to talk like TOTI, to find themselves in the world, to talk like TOTUS.

111
00:12:10,801 --> 00:12:15,840
And that's that usually shows up at the end of every chapter.

112
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,401
And you'll see it does in this too.

113
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:22,881
But now let's see, the next thing is going to 269 after we start hearing about this.

114
00:12:22,881 --> 00:12:38,921
It will, unless he he introduces the notion of in unbalance here at the bottom, it will be replied that unless the eyes are focused, these two groupings cannot be superimposed on each other, nor give rise to a vision of anything.

115
00:12:38,921 --> 00:12:42,761
And in this sense, their presence alone creates a state of unbalance.

116
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:45,001
And that's sort of on the right track.

117
00:12:45,001 --> 00:12:48,041
And because he says, isn't admitting what we're trying to show?

118
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:53,481
That the sight of a single object is not a simple outcome of focusing the eyes.

119
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,121
Now comes this, it is anticipated in the very act of focusing.

120
00:12:58,121 --> 00:13:04,041
Or that has been stated, that the focusing of the gaze is a prospective activity.

121
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:11,481
For my gaze to alight on near objects and to focus my eyes on them, we must experience double vision as an unbalance.

122
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,881
That's always the crucial thing.

123
00:13:13,881 --> 00:13:19,641
Some kind of something that isn't right and is pulling you to get it right.

124
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:34,841
Even the masks and the ships are, remember, like a storm on the horizon, unstable and make you uneasy until you get to them, they pull you into getting the right picture of them, which is stable and the masks and the trees separate out.

125
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,881
It's always that.

126
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,641
So there is this unbalance.

127
00:13:37,641 --> 00:13:41,001
But it'll go on because everything in here is mixed.

128
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,521
That's going on at the bottom.

129
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:51,481
Not balanced, or because an imperfect vision tends toward the single object, is toward the release of tension and the completion of vision.

130
00:13:51,481 --> 00:13:53,961
The top of 270, I think.

131
00:13:55,241 --> 00:14:10,440
Now, I have to say at some point, and I'll say it here, he doesn't talk here about motivation, but it's a very important idea of his, which, and it's very hard to figure out what it means because I don't think he ever tells you just outright.

132
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,921
But this is a case of motivation.

133
00:14:12,921 --> 00:14:21,361
It's whenever there's a tension that's pulling you to get a better grip, then that motivates you.

134
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,121
Not in the sense that you say to yourself, gee, it would be nice to have a better grip.

135
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:34,721
But motivation is his name for this being drawn to the optimal, which I'll talk more about in a minute again.

136
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:42,161
And it's supposed to be neither causal nor it's neither empiricist nor intellectual.

137
00:14:42,960 --> 00:15:09,440
The way this tension pulls you to get the two images together and see an object isn't that you're caused by some third-person process in the brain, or I mean, there is some third-person process in the brain, all right, and it underlies it, all right, but it has to do what it does by underlying something which is an experience of deviation from a norm, to put it another way.

138
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,641
And you're being pulled toward the norm.

139
00:15:12,641 --> 00:15:19,520
That's not mere causal, and it's certainly supposed to be not mental, not intellectual.

140
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:32,001
It isn't as if there is some reason such you can deduce, or you don't anyway, that this image is enough like that image, that I should superimpose them.

141
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:49,121
It's this ground-level narrow pony, and Sean Kelly will talk about this too, that the experience has always got this thing, that in order to have perceptual experience, you've got to be sensitive to these norms and deviations from the norms.

142
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,401
And you mean, again, your body's human.

143
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,801
Okay, I'm going to go on, because I always have the same point over and over.

144
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:02,921
How about 12 lines or 15 down on 270?

145
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:29,721
We pass from double vision to the single object, not through an inspection of the mind, see that's being intellectualist, but when the two eyes cease to function each on its own account and are used in a single organ for one single day, it is not the epistemological subject who brings about the synthesis, but the body, when it escapes from dispersion, pulls itself together and tends by all means in its power towards one single goal of activity.

146
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:39,401
And when one single intention is formed in it through the phenomenon of synergy, well, namely, again, it's being pulled toward this single goal.

147
00:16:39,401 --> 00:16:43,961
And the single goal, I'll read you quotes, but is always maximal grip.

148
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:56,361
Getting the most, we'll see a quote in a minute, the richest and the best form and the most sort of coming out the way you expected it.

149
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,001
Experience.

150
00:16:57,001 --> 00:17:02,041
Don't even bother to write that down yet because I'll show you the clear place where he finally says it.

151
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:07,721
But on 270, we've got that, we've got, and then he says intentionality.

152
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:14,601
After our discussion last time, or the last two times, I'm trying to figure out what he means by intentionality.

153
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,360
So down toward the bottom, about 10 lines in the bottom of 270.

154
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:27,001
What is meant by saying that this intentionality is not a thought is it does not come into being through the transparency of any consciousness.

155
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:36,760
It takes for granted all the latent knowledge of itself and my knowledge, knowledge of itself that my body possesses.

156
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:44,320
Well, I think I keep wanting to say intentionality is tied up with something like motivation.

157
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,401
It's not something you're trying to do.

158
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:56,560
I mean, you've got to separate it from Thorough-like intentionality, where you have a goal and you represent this goal and then you do something to achieve the goal.

159
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,840
That's a kind of intentionality, too.

160
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,001
And that's sort of close to what it is for human beings to have intentions.

161
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:09,761
And so Thurow talks about prior intentions and intentions in action when he describes that.

162
00:18:09,761 --> 00:18:14,080
But this is some, there is a kind of teleology.

163
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,440
There is this tendency toward this optimal.

164
00:18:17,441 --> 00:18:22,880
But it's not something that any, any, that is anybody's intention.

165
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,001
And it isn't clear what the goal is until you get it.

166
00:18:26,001 --> 00:18:32,560
It isn't like I have a goal of going and getting ice cream and I know exactly what I want, how many scoops and what flavor and all that.

167
00:18:32,721 --> 00:18:33,841
You don't know what you want.

168
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,921
You just want the tension to go away.

169
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,121
And you don't even want that.

170
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,600
Your body wants the tension to go away.

171
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:52,720
And when the tension goes away, you will have the optimal grip and you will see a stable object with stable properties and stable size, stable distance, and all the things that this calculus fout.

172
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:02,241
So there's a kind of intentionality that's not thought, not representational to talk like Thurley.

173
00:19:03,281 --> 00:19:06,320
And it's got, now that's the first point.

174
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:12,480
The second point is, this paragraph interests me because of the talk about latent knowledge.

175
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:16,720
What sort of latent knowledge?

176
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:27,600
Well, it's again this self-normativeness of the body knowing that it doesn't feel good this way.

177
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:35,240
There would be a better way to see it instead of two hands, all blurry, one clear hand, and so forth.

178
00:19:35,481 --> 00:19:38,921
The body knows that there would be a better way to see it.

179
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,560
It doesn't have to know what the better way is, and it doesn't know it.

180
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,480
in a knowledge source.

181
00:19:45,481 --> 00:19:54,041
It senses that this is good enough, there is a better, and it senses which direction will make it better.

182
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:58,441
It's always, I can see it better from, I could see it better from over there.

183
00:19:58,441 --> 00:20:03,640
I feel that if only I was over there, I could get a better grip on it, get a better look at it, and so forth.

184
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,041
That's bottom line.

185
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:12,361
That's important because it's related to what Alda talks about.

186
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,480
It's too bad he isn't here, but we talk about it.

187
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:18,761
It's not behind his back because we talk about it all the time.

188
00:20:18,761 --> 00:20:44,680
And he has this important idea that we have in our body an understanding of if I do such and such, such and such will happen, so that my experience of the mind knowing this as a table involves, not intellectually, but a whole bodily understanding of all the ways I could move correlated with what I would then experience.

189
00:20:44,681 --> 00:20:54,840
And I think Merloponte thinks that's not wrong, but it leaves out this important pull toward an optimal.

190
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,761
It's the normative part that he would say is missing from that description.

191
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,880
And for Merloponte, the normative part is the important part.

192
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,320
Namely, it isn't just that if I do this, I'll see that.

193
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,681
And if I do this, I'll see that.

194
00:21:10,681 --> 00:21:12,681
And if I do this, I'll see the table from here.

195
00:21:12,681 --> 00:21:14,720
And if I do that, I'll see it from the bottom.

196
00:21:14,721 --> 00:21:27,600
It's that if I'm seeing a table like that, I feel that there's a kind of tension that I could get a better look at it from here, and maybe even a better look at it from here.

197
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:34,320
There's, and perhaps this is the optimum, that that feeling is crucial.

198
00:21:36,481 --> 00:21:41,440
It doesn't get represented in a bunch of rules for if I do this, then that.

199
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:48,961
It can't be represented because it's about what feels better, not just the correlation between perception and action.

200
00:21:48,961 --> 00:21:49,920
Yeah, Rick.

201
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:55,840
So how does the actual task that you're engaged in that or wasn't pulling you?

202
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,761
Because, you know, there is an animal advantage the way you presented it.

203
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,320
I think isn't right, that it is complete.

204
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,041
Well, you know, if you want to change this.

205
00:22:05,681 --> 00:22:06,720
Good example.

206
00:22:06,721 --> 00:22:06,960
Yes.

207
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:08,961
Right.

208
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:09,361
Okay.

209
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,041
Fascinating.

210
00:22:11,441 --> 00:22:16,400
This is something we discussed yesterday, some of us, and it's good for Rick for bringing it up.

211
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,360
I can say certain things that are clear, and then there's something I'm not clear about, and I think we disagree about.

212
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:34,480
But what Rick has said is obviously true, that it's relative to your task, and that your optimal grip depends on what you're looking for.

213
00:22:34,481 --> 00:23:01,240
However, and I don't think Rick disagrees, there is a level in which the body schema is trying to get an optimal somehow more basic than this past relative thing, which is just there is perceptually the best way to look at it, and you will have at this level of description a feeling that you're not getting it right if you don't get it better that way.

214
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:05,481
Now, that could come in conflict with your, and that's what one does.

215
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:20,120
The one thing, the anonymous bodied schema has its own idea, so to speak, idea, its own sense of what's optimal, and its own sense of tension and deviation when you don't get that.

216
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:27,320
And it's the same for all of us, and it doesn't have to do with our purposes.

217
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:34,041
And now, sort of on top of that, and sort of overriding that, can be the purposes that he certainly has.

218
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:40,521
I have to find a quote that I was going to use much later in the lecture, but since you brought it up, I think we should find it now.

219
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:54,761
There's a place where he specifically talks about how what he's describing takes place on this MON1 neutral basis.

220
00:23:54,761 --> 00:23:57,160
Maybe somebody will know where that is.

221
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,281
Maybe not.

222
00:23:59,001 --> 00:24:00,600
Yeah, yeah, you got that?

223
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:04,680
It's in our reading for, I think, like next time.

224
00:24:04,761 --> 00:24:05,720
I'm not sure.

225
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:09,721
Yeah, we already read it, but it's coming up again, though, I think.

226
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,680
But it comes up, of course, everything comes up again and again.

227
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,761
250 is one place where he says that.

228
00:24:14,761 --> 00:24:15,560
250?

229
00:24:15,801 --> 00:24:16,921
I'm not sure he's getting it.

230
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,681
Yeah, no, there's one place where he says it so clearly.

231
00:24:20,681 --> 00:24:38,441
What I'm interested in, there's a, because I had this discussion that we had yesterday in mind, a place where he clearly separates the kind of personal historical optimal from this universal body optimal.

232
00:24:38,441 --> 00:24:39,560
And I have to find it.

233
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:42,880
Yeah.

234
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,640
A different place.

235
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,840
I believe so.

236
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:47,600
I'm not sure I remember the one cushion.

237
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,841
Where will it tell me again where that was?

238
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,960
I found 250.

239
00:24:51,201 --> 00:24:52,001
350.

240
00:24:52,001 --> 00:24:52,801
350.

241
00:24:52,801 --> 00:24:53,920
250.

242
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,560
I don't think I was back reading on 250.

243
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,001
No, that's fine, but I don't think that's it.

244
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:01,600
Maybe, let me look.

245
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,160
No, no, it's another one.

246
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,521
A little clearer on this issue.

247
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:15,200
Well, if I just go on, which I will do, we will find it, because I have it listed as one of the quotes I wanted to read on the time comes.

248
00:25:15,441 --> 00:25:16,880
Okay, let's wait.

249
00:25:17,521 --> 00:25:18,560
Where are we now?

250
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,120
So on 270, we've got this one cushion.

251
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,720
The, well, what is one 50?

252
00:25:24,961 --> 00:25:30,320
Pulls itself together, intentionality and issues like that.

253
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:36,080
And then on 271, still reading things I think are very important, the top of the page.

254
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,360
Herein lies the distinction between the perceptual synthesis and the intellectual synthesis.

255
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:47,360
On passing from double to normal vision, I'm not simply aware of seeing with my two eyes the same object.

256
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:54,080
I am aware of progressing toward the object itself and finally enjoying its concrete presence.

257
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,360
That's, you see, that's this normative thing.

258
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:03,600
That's not just getting the sensory motor coordination.

259
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:14,241
It's seeing that you've got the best and on some level best, on this basic level best, I think, view.

260
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:16,480
I haven't claimed to have answered Rick's objection yet.

261
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,441
We'll come across, and if we don't, there's no answer, but it's a possible paper topic.

262
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:49,801
And to balance out what the relation is between the impersonal body schema that's just doing this job of getting a grip on objects, which is the same for everybody who has a body like ours, and how this is related to individuals with their own interests, desires, and purposes getting a grip on things like the bubblegum is something very unclear, I think, in Malafonte.

263
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:55,961
But I don't think it's terribly, I mean, all you have to do is just try to get the phenomena right.

264
00:26:56,201 --> 00:26:58,041
It's true, both.

265
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:06,360
Only I think my reading makes it a lot more important than more basic, this general one.

266
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:15,160
And my feeling is that the book, being about perception, is trying to make this level, if common level, more important than basic.

267
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:15,480
Yeah.

268
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:18,041
Can you say precisely why it's supposed to be important?

269
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:24,680
I mean, is the idea that is the worry that are taking our personal projects and stuff like that into account?

270
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,160
No, no, no, I see a good point.

271
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:38,441
No, it's just the only reason it's important to separate them out is because you want to be clear as to what the decisive factor is.

272
00:27:38,761 --> 00:27:57,721
And if experiencing a solid object which is present to you in the flesh, so to speak, fully given with what you're trying to explain, then all you need is the universal body schema story to explain it, the one perceives in me.

273
00:27:57,721 --> 00:28:03,320
And if you bring in personal things, it isn't that you do anything wrong, you sort of muddy the argument.

274
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:12,440
And the basic issue in this book is how we perceive objects as rich and present.

275
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:18,401
It isn't sort of how, what particular features interest us and so forth.

276
00:28:13,721 --> 00:28:19,120
That's my feeling.

277
00:28:19,521 --> 00:28:22,480
I think both of Eric and OJ disagree.

278
00:28:22,481 --> 00:28:23,921
Eric got there first, yeah.

279
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:29,200
I think it's not fair to say that this book is primarily about intentional perception.

280
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,080
Oh, of course.

281
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:30,880
Of course.

282
00:28:33,681 --> 00:28:34,560
Sure, you can.

283
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:59,921
I mean, not you can't deny that the individual is acting with concern, but you could claim, and I think Merrill Kanji does claim, and I want to claim, you can separate out a part of the action, which is the same for everybody, and all you need is that when you're trying to talk about why the object is rich and present and self-sufficient and opaque and has hypothetically, and what's the other word?

284
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,600
I forget, but we're going to get there.

285
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:14,720
All that typical Merrill Kanzi talk, what it is to be an object of perception, I think you can talk about that, and of course you have to bring in action because it's drawing you to move in such a way as to get the grip.

286
00:29:14,721 --> 00:29:20,080
But you don't have to bring in the fact that an individual person is acting.

287
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,600
That you can just bracket out.

288
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,560
That's all I want to say.

289
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:36,160
You don't think it's such a measure here that the difference between the animal level and the human level is precisely the basic individuality of the animal.

290
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:46,720
But, I mean, I mean, this is just a kind of non-secret mean that you bring even the individual part.

291
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,521
No, well, I would get rid of culture, too.

292
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:50,680
Well, Calibrity.

293
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,401
Yes, well, he does, and he doesn't.

294
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,920
I mean, I mean, right, it isn't the only space you live in.

295
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:02,120
But if you want to understand, give it what you want to understand what it is to be a perceptual object, you know.

296
00:30:02,441 --> 00:30:07,320
But then you're shifting back to the fact that there's the perceptual rules and everything.

297
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,560
But you say that he's only talking about this.

298
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,201
Oh, no, I don't say he's only talking about this.

299
00:30:12,201 --> 00:30:12,440
Okay.

300
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:14,281
This is the most important part.

301
00:30:14,281 --> 00:30:15,721
Which is the one I'm talking about.

302
00:30:15,721 --> 00:30:16,440
Yes, yes.

303
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:21,880
And to understand the way humans behave and everything, which is the different perspectives.

304
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,000
You don't mean I suppose.

305
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,841
That we're agreeing, right?

306
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,880
Or I mean not agreeing.

307
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,920
Later, or even to do that?

308
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,600
Even to talk about the level at which there is solid.

309
00:30:32,761 --> 00:30:33,640
We can talk about pictures.

310
00:30:33,801 --> 00:30:35,320
No, you don't give the whole picture.

311
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,880
I mean, the question is somehow hard to focus.

312
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:49,560
I mean, the question is: can you do a story that is a partial picture, but is not modified by adding on the next one?

313
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:54,281
It isn't as if the shared we all see it the same way changes by culture.

314
00:30:54,281 --> 00:31:00,121
They all see objects as solid, as present, as having a kind of thisness and a fullness.

315
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:04,281
That's the affair and the astheity that we talked about.

316
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:06,360
That's just totally cross-cultural.

317
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,120
Probably animals have it too, but we can't.

318
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,240
You know, you're good.

319
00:31:09,241 --> 00:31:09,720
You can.

320
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,241
Right, though.

321
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,121
Leads to.

322
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:16,600
It's all we're having, just a discussion of sort of method.

323
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,440
And there are two ways it leads to.

324
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:38,041
Leads to it in such a way that it feeds back, it modifies in some basic way the perceptual level, or leads to it in the sense that once you've got the kind of beings that we are, you not only see objects this way, but you see them symbolically and you can see them as yours and so forth.

325
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:39,641
And I don't think we disagree.

326
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,640
That doesn't change the good.

327
00:31:42,441 --> 00:31:42,881
Good.

328
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,480
That doesn't change the natural.

329
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:47,521
Okay, it's very important on a certain way.

330
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:50,960
We're trying to understand what a whole human experience in a human world is.

331
00:31:51,281 --> 00:31:52,961
And that we're not disagreeing.

332
00:31:52,961 --> 00:32:03,680
But I think that the really important contribution of Merila-Ponty, it's the most original and probably most important to him, is the level that I keep trying to stress.

333
00:32:03,681 --> 00:32:04,721
And that's fine.

334
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:08,400
I mean, I don't think we've got much disagreement there yet.

335
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,480
So, I think you like your position and read as the question.

336
00:32:12,721 --> 00:32:13,120
Okay.

337
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:20,161
Would your view be that the body schema has this kind of natural level and then a cultural level like violence?

338
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,960
So the vibe.

339
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:29,761
And so one question I have is that it seems like part of the one that perceives in the other cultural one that has a sense of the appropriate distance to stand.

340
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,320
That's true.

341
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:32,560
So you would say that it's part of the body schema.

342
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,840
That is part of the one that perceives it.

343
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,560
That's right.

344
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,680
But it's a cultural part of the violation and not a natural level.

345
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:44,720
Yes, and to put it in the funny slogan of Merilo-Panti, it has a history because I learned to stand that way in this culture.

346
00:32:44,721 --> 00:32:49,041
And there's this other one that has a prehistory which is always already given.

347
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:50,000
That's the natural one.

348
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,121
That's the natural one.

349
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,960
It's really innate.

350
00:32:52,961 --> 00:32:54,480
But he doesn't like to terminate.

351
00:32:54,481 --> 00:32:56,241
I don't know why, or maybe he hasn't got it.

352
00:32:56,241 --> 00:33:05,521
But he says things like, it has a history that was never present, meaning that's what all of us have, and that's it.

353
00:33:05,521 --> 00:33:19,281
And then, I agree with you, we have, each of us, by way of our culture and also by way of our family and also by way of our personal thing, our own history, which, thanks to the intentional arc, will show up in the objects.

354
00:33:19,281 --> 00:33:28,120
So, some objects are frightening to you that are sweet for me, and vice versa, and that's going to show up in our world, too.

355
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,401
And that's fine.

356
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,080
I guess we're agreeing about that.

357
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:32,840
You were right.

358
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,560
I'm glad you did.

359
00:33:27,761 --> 00:33:34,521
And that is my position.

360
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:42,120
And he has this distinction between the history that never was present and what we really got through our history.

361
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,441
Yeah.

362
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,681
So, what would you say about this?

363
00:33:44,681 --> 00:33:50,201
I mean, when we're in the engaged attitude, are our concerns being sort of at the forefront of...

364
00:33:50,681 --> 00:33:51,960
At the forefront.

365
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:53,160
I don't know what to say.

366
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,001
I don't know, because I can't tell what that means.

367
00:33:55,001 --> 00:33:57,560
I wouldn't be surprised they're at the forefront.

368
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,001
I'll take that metaphor.

369
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:01,560
And I think what he's interested in is the background.

370
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:21,560
They're only possible with these things to be in the forefront because we do this impersonal constituting, if you want, well, I don't like that language, no, this impersonal organizing or experiencing of stable, perceptual, solid, present objects in the background, because it's done physically and all the time.

371
00:34:21,721 --> 00:34:22,840
It's just on the background.

372
00:34:24,121 --> 00:34:29,320
No, because you can focus on the background while within it.

373
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,761
I mean, now we've got two problems.

374
00:34:30,761 --> 00:34:32,520
I don't want to talk about both of them.

375
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,200
I mean, the kind of reflection that's involved here is doubly weird.

376
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:36,761
I say that.

377
00:34:36,761 --> 00:34:48,840
And you see in every once in a while things are radical kind of reflection because it doesn't, it tries to describe the world when we're not reflecting, when we're engaged, fully immersed in what we're doing.

378
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,640
And then you've got two funny problems.

379
00:34:51,641 --> 00:35:02,921
I mean, you've got to describe it without somehow capture this background body set that's doing all this, the body schema, and describe how that works.

380
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:10,360
And he does it with metaphors like I've been using, the thickness, the richness, the full of objects, and so forth.

381
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:22,801
And then you can also capture, if you're interested in human freedom, for instance, the last chapter of the book, which we're going to read, then you want to understand how the world appears to workers as opposed to capitalists.

382
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,960
Oh, but back to hotels, okay.

383
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,160
I don't want to think about that.

384
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,280
Ah, okay.

385
00:35:27,761 --> 00:35:28,560
I saw another hand.

386
00:35:28,561 --> 00:35:29,360
Eric?

387
00:35:30,641 --> 00:35:36,241
I think this last point about Freeman makes me sure you do.

388
00:35:36,241 --> 00:35:37,840
But you just mustn't think.

389
00:35:38,161 --> 00:35:53,360
And another philosophical position would be, and there are people who certainly strongly believe this, that either, I mean, there's several, that given our history and our culture, it permeates and changes perception all the way down.

390
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,201
That's some kind of view.

391
00:35:55,201 --> 00:35:58,480
I mean, I don't know who holds that view, but I've got lots of people do.

392
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:58,960
Really?

393
00:36:00,161 --> 00:36:03,760
Do you think it overrides and changes our perception of objects?

394
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:11,681
Yes, which is why my mother has holy water in her refrigerator from Blourge, France, and appears to her in a radically different exploit.

395
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,601
Well, it's sacred water.

396
00:36:13,601 --> 00:36:17,281
Yes, but it's got obscenity and acidity.

397
00:36:17,281 --> 00:36:22,560
It's solid, it's present, it teaches properties, it's got a size, it's got a distance, and blah, blah, blah.

398
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,241
If you were in the same boat, those shoulder regressed in the same way.

399
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,641
Yeah, and if I told her, by the way, that was important.

400
00:36:30,161 --> 00:36:31,360
I said cross-border.

401
00:36:32,161 --> 00:36:32,640
Okay?

402
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,320
So when they're waiting, what do you mean by the same thing?

403
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:45,281
Yeah, so, well, but the difference between calling it a natural has this understanding of an understanding of being.

404
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,241
So everything we understand is we we can't understand it as being a creation of God.

405
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,840
Now is that why that our understanding of everything.

406
00:36:54,081 --> 00:37:04,761
Okay, but the question is, I don't want to go further with this, but I'm just going to say, the question is, du in what way does it look look does it look different when it you see it as a creation of God?

407
00:37:04,761 --> 00:37:06,680
And that's a tricky question.

408
00:37:06,681 --> 00:37:18,280
I mean, that's another possible paper topic, because there's some way that it looks exactly as it looks to the the primitives and to the in pre-linguistic children, and another sense in which it doesn't.

409
00:37:18,281 --> 00:37:19,400
By the way, one more point about this.

410
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,040
No, no, no.

411
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,320
I don't want to talk more about this.

412
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,480
Well, okay, both James have been a second.

413
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:32,201
The really more, the place where this issue becomes clearest, and I don't know if it's really discussed in this book or not.

414
00:37:32,201 --> 00:37:39,880
I can't think of any place where it is, is whether when you get language, it radically transforms perception all the way down.

415
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,961
There are people certainly who believe this.

416
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,600
Lots of people.

417
00:37:43,241 --> 00:37:44,840
Yeah, but not in this book, right?

418
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,080
Yeah, I think later Merle Ponte does.

419
00:37:47,081 --> 00:37:48,200
I'm not sure he should.

420
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,400
It's funny.

421
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:55,641
Heidegger does too, after being in time, think that language transforms our experience all the way down.

422
00:37:55,641 --> 00:38:04,201
Some important issue there, one way that just so you realize this is an interesting issue, is is our perception like the animals?

423
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:11,481
And there are people who are very much convinced that our perception is not like the animals because we have language.

424
00:38:11,641 --> 00:38:19,241
A puzzle for such people, it seems to me, is what two-year-old children are supposed to be like when they're perceiving just prior to language.

425
00:38:19,241 --> 00:38:30,120
Because when it seems to me pretty strange to say that these children are just like animals until they get language and then their perception is radically transformed it.

426
00:38:30,201 --> 00:38:31,080
It might be true.

427
00:38:31,081 --> 00:38:32,680
There's certain people who believe it.

428
00:38:32,681 --> 00:38:34,281
I don't know how you can find out.

429
00:38:34,601 --> 00:38:35,881
Okay, James.

430
00:38:39,241 --> 00:38:39,400
Okay.

431
00:38:36,241 --> 00:38:41,480
Um, you said you're starting to conversations about language what kind of bridge concepts do you have?

432
00:38:42,561 --> 00:38:44,720
It just depends on what we're trying to explain.

433
00:38:44,721 --> 00:39:03,920
So the more common the explanatum, the more the more people who you share the same the same kind of experience we're trying to explain, the more the guys can appeal to Dasman or one's task and one's uh I'm sure some of you don't know that's German for the one.

434
00:39:04,081 --> 00:39:05,761
He says one perceives the meaning.

435
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:09,920
You're getting it from Heidegger and Heidegger rights or you're speaking German.

436
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,440
Oh, the is Gasman.

437
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,320
Go ahead.

438
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:27,600
So the more the more common the exploratory experience we're trying to explain is, the more we're going to appeal to the one to the task of the one, and the more particular it is, the more we're going to appeal to the features of the individual.

439
00:39:28,081 --> 00:39:35,041
It doesn't matter if the features of the individual, the task of the individual, do infect the experience all the way down.

440
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,081
Depending on the level of commonality we're trying to explain, the more...

441
00:39:39,281 --> 00:39:40,480
I know I don't like that.

442
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:48,320
I mean, I don't think that's, I think that's makes it just relevant to our interest whether we if the language affects our experience all the way down.

443
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,320
And I want to say, no, it's a substantive question whether it does or not.

444
00:39:52,320 --> 00:40:03,601
And it is, and no matter how interested you are in how much language affects our perceptions, you can hold the view that children, pre-linguistic and us, see things exactly the same way.

445
00:40:04,161 --> 00:40:09,681
So, yeah, but the language fits to work out something like that.

446
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:15,121
That's basically all of the aims of the individual and so on in trying to characterize.

447
00:40:15,281 --> 00:40:15,440
Yeah.

448
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,640
I could see that.

449
00:40:16,641 --> 00:40:18,241
Language is the hardest.

450
00:40:18,241 --> 00:40:34,441
And I guess I want to say that if you think language affects it, then of course you think that the individual and the style of the culture affect your perception of an object.

451
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:41,080
And if you think language doesn't, then I think you also think that your personal interest in your culture don't.

452
00:40:41,241 --> 00:40:45,881
I don't think language is all that special about it, about this big issue.

453
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:51,080
But I don't want to spend more time on this issue because that wasn't what I came to talk about.

454
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:53,640
Though it's an issue that ought to come up sometime, and now it has.

455
00:40:53,641 --> 00:40:55,080
In fact, it keeps coming up.

456
00:40:55,081 --> 00:41:03,000
So I'm going to go back to where I was because it's fascinating exactly what I want to talk about on page 271.

457
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:14,520
It's when he gets all these gets onto the notion of presence with this side of Merlot Fonti, it makes our perception like children and animals prominent.

458
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:20,040
So starting right at the top, herein lies the distinction between the perceptual synthesis and the intellectual.

459
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:26,521
On passing from double to normal vision, I'm not simply aware of seeing with my two eyes the same object.

460
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:32,040
I'm aware of progressing towards the object itself and enjoying its concrete presence.

461
00:41:32,761 --> 00:41:35,480
Presence is a big deal word in Merlot Fonti.

462
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,001
It's not just any old thing.

463
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,360
Remember, it's got to do with the way the back of the house is already present.

464
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,760
We have a front of the girl or the guy.

465
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,960
When you see objects, you don't just see surfaces or data.

466
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,881
You see the whole thing.

467
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:54,840
But here's what he does, his obstiety and the affinity of it.

468
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,761
So let's read it a little further down.

469
00:41:56,761 --> 00:42:07,320
The 50-month sound, the binocular object in which the synthesis occurs, absorbs the monocular image, and which in this new light finally recognize themselves as appearances of that object.

470
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:15,120
My set of experiences is presented as a concordant whole, and the synthesis takes place not insofar as they all express the same invariant.

471
00:42:13,641 --> 00:42:18,560
That's the intellectual handy and the identity of the object.

472
00:42:19,201 --> 00:42:21,281
That's again more interesting intellectualists.

473
00:42:21,281 --> 00:42:29,121
They all come under the same concept, but in that they are collected together by the last of their number in the expirity of a thing.

474
00:42:29,121 --> 00:42:40,401
That means when they come together, then what is really, what is experienced is really there as sort of taper needs ghosts back into it.

475
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,560
And the expirity means distance.

476
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:45,760
The distance is, of course, never reached.

477
00:42:45,761 --> 00:42:48,320
That would be the pure distance of the thing.

478
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,561
Then you have to sort of take in every aspect of it from everywhere.

479
00:42:52,561 --> 00:43:02,801
Each aspect of the thing which falls to our perception is still only an invictation to proceed beyond, still only a momentary halt in the perceptual process.

480
00:43:02,801 --> 00:43:08,641
I wanted to mention that because that's very interesting.

481
00:43:08,641 --> 00:43:16,320
Because it sounds always like the perceptual process is reaching equilibrium, is somehow getting someplace and stopping.

482
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,721
And most of the time he does talk that way.

483
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:23,441
You get an imbalance which you finally balance, a tension which finally goes away.

484
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:53,561
And yet, it's clear that there's something wrong with that way of talking, too, because you've never sort of arrived at now you've seen the object so completely that there's nothing more to see and or one because you switched to some other object but two because there's always more to see about any object that's its richness so he wants to say both that there's a tension toward equilibrium, that that isn't ever uh final.

485
00:43:53,561 --> 00:43:57,960
And I don't know quite how to say that right, and I don't know I don't think he knows how to say that.

486
00:43:57,761 --> 00:44:14,761
There seems to be, I mean, I picture of it something like this, that we're tending toward an optimal grip on this object, but then some other purpose or some other object attracts our attention, and before we've ever even finished getting a grip on this one, we're already off getting a grip on that one.

487
00:44:14,761 --> 00:44:33,881
And we certainly and so that we don't so that though there's a tension and you are always moving in the direction of reducing it, I don't think it's important to know that you arrive at the equilibrium of the zero tension of the total balance.

488
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:40,041
I mean, it's always there as the goal that explains the way your perception is organized.

489
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:43,000
But I don't think it's something you have to arrive at, yeah?

490
00:44:43,161 --> 00:44:50,281
The goal is important, you zoom in on it and you can keep feedback all the time.

491
00:44:50,281 --> 00:44:51,241
It's really interesting.

492
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:54,920
You just go and buy a microscope and then you get it.

493
00:44:56,281 --> 00:45:05,561
So I think the way to put it is the norm aspect, which is absolutely crucial, is that you are always trying to get a better grip.

494
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:13,161
That is, and in a certain sense, therefore, you could say you're always trying to get an or tending toward an optimal grip.

495
00:45:13,161 --> 00:45:23,881
But I don't think that you need to think of it as what you are actually doing is arriving at an optimal grip, or that if you fail to arrive at an optimal grip, you have somehow not perceived.

496
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:37,081
The thing is, as long as you're moving toward a better, clearer, richer grip, that's all you need to explain all the phenomena that he's trying to explain.

497
00:45:37,081 --> 00:45:39,520
I don't think the arriving at...

498
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,320
Nope, that's wrong.

499
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:46,400
Some of the experiences he wants to explain require an optimal grip.

500
00:45:46,721 --> 00:45:53,281
Help me remember that when we get to the notion, when we get to depth, and the distance, that is, or depth is anything.

501
00:45:54,241 --> 00:45:55,601
There you need an optimal.

502
00:45:55,601 --> 00:45:57,680
And size, you need an optimal.

503
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,561
Huh.

504
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:59,600
Interesting.

505
00:45:59,601 --> 00:46:01,121
I'll just tell you what I'm thinking.

506
00:46:01,121 --> 00:46:13,601
The size an object is, perceived as being, is the size which it appears to have when you have an optimal grip on it, he says, I believe.

507
00:46:13,601 --> 00:46:31,041
And the distance an object seems to be is experienced as how far it's from what it's like to experience the object optimal.

508
00:46:31,360 --> 00:47:05,360
So I guess I believe, and I'm going to, that's the two chapters I want to explain today, or at least by next time, that the depth story and size constancy story assume that you actually get, not that you always have a maximum grip, but somehow the experience that you have when you do have an object, plays a crucial role in your experience of what it is to have a certain size and to be a certain distance.

509
00:47:06,161 --> 00:47:08,080
Rich, were you onto this already?

510
00:47:08,081 --> 00:47:08,560
Yeah, why?

511
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:09,681
What?

512
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,241
Because.

513
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,360
I don't talk about what?

514
00:47:12,161 --> 00:47:13,360
Oh, I see the task.

515
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,801
No, I don't want to talk about the task.

516
00:47:14,801 --> 00:47:16,281
That's why you're running into this problem.

517
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:23,521
So, the quantum special example of equilibrium that William T gives is when you're engaged in the task, you're looking at a painting.

518
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:37,320
And there, you want to get a maximum grip of behaving, not as having microscopic properties that you would look at through a black microscope, but as a work of art in the museum where there's certain lighting, and then that's what's pulling you.

519
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:45,080
So, you are being pulled, and there is this maximum grip stories to be told, but all that is the field vendor that's not for trying to accomplish.

520
00:47:45,081 --> 00:47:58,440
And that's why, you know, when I want to find an object inside, you know, a fork instead of the knife or speaking in a dark kitchen, once I get the knife, I maximally grip it, and then I move on to the other task.

521
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,960
And it's not like I don't believe that knife.

522
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,440
Once I have the knife, can I go on and I can't do that?

523
00:48:04,601 --> 00:48:05,960
I disagree with you about this.

524
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:11,960
I think I've seen you and the chair and the book, all task-free, so to speak.

525
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,040
And then some of them I have a task.

526
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,241
Oh, I like reading the book.

527
00:48:15,241 --> 00:48:22,441
But the chair, I got no task at all, but it's got its CAD and it's the Eddie and CAD.

528
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,721
And I think, and when I look out, there goes a police car.

529
00:48:25,721 --> 00:48:29,401
I got no interest whatsoever in that police car that I perceive it.

530
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,120
And I just don't want to deny disagreement.

531
00:48:32,681 --> 00:48:36,360
Well, the disagreement is again, boy, we're stuck on this one.

532
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:44,601
That whether there's this basic level that you can describe in a task-free, language-free, culture-free way or not.

533
00:48:45,161 --> 00:49:06,600
Because in French differently, he says that when you cross the concourse design barriers, when you're crossing us in fact, there's a girl who can always stop this task and just concentrate off your what's on the wall, and then you do it for the predictions of the world to do your so I think Santa's saying the opposite of what you're saying.

534
00:49:06,601 --> 00:49:10,480
So you don't always have a task, which does like you always have a task.

535
00:49:10,761 --> 00:49:11,721
Well, then you don't have it.

536
00:49:11,721 --> 00:49:27,200
But I mean, and now when when you suspend it do you reveal a more fundamental well but I think you could suspend it and reveal thereby a fundamental thing that the one is the one is doing in you through your body schema whether you've got a task or not.

537
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,880
But it's each other.

538
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,640
No, no, it's never the whole picture.

539
00:49:30,641 --> 00:49:32,000
It's a methodological point.

540
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:43,120
I think the bike would be sense of our getting a maximum grip on anything without involving that somehow in the parents.

541
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,480
Yes, all the time.

542
00:49:46,081 --> 00:49:46,241
Yeah.

543
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:47,761
Yeah.

544
00:49:47,761 --> 00:49:49,120
I mean, absolutely.

545
00:49:49,121 --> 00:49:55,120
I mean, every tree I see when I walk down the street out there and so forth, unless my task is what?

546
00:49:56,081 --> 00:49:58,241
Oh, you are maximally gripping them.

547
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,440
I think all of them.

548
00:50:00,241 --> 00:50:02,080
Or at least, no, I think you're not.

549
00:50:02,081 --> 00:50:02,801
Of course not.

550
00:50:02,801 --> 00:50:23,040
But what you are experiencing due to them as attention away and in the experience of them is a sense of what it would be like to get in a better look at them and not task, but just in them there is a tendency to pull you to what would give you a best look at them independent of the task.

551
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,281
For example, all the noises that are going on.

552
00:50:25,601 --> 00:50:28,960
Now you're you want to get a maximum group of blind voices when I understand them.

553
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,120
Yeah.

554
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:36,880
And just as there is the bell ring and also, you know, going by or something like that you're trying to pay attention to all these things.

555
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,480
And if you're asked to change them, and then you do make an effort to get an active movement.

556
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,241
That's why you're turning your face and listening.

557
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,320
You're not turning your head down and listening to the bell.

558
00:50:44,801 --> 00:50:46,840
You turn in your base and you know basically.

559
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,200
I'm not sure, I mean, it's a task.

560
00:50:49,201 --> 00:50:59,801
I mean, I think he thinks that there are things that attract your attention, and it could be that the bells attract your attention, in which case you then sort of pay attention and zoom in on them.

561
00:51:00,121 --> 00:51:08,681
Uh whether you have to have a task of whether paying attention and zooming in on an object that's drawing your attention is your task.

562
00:51:08,681 --> 00:51:12,201
Boy, is this uninteresting something?

563
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:21,801
If you didn't you weren't guided by the task, then you would be pulled in an infinite number of directions, trying to get a mask and river everything at the same time.

564
00:51:21,801 --> 00:51:24,201
No, no, why shouldn't something pull you rather than others?

565
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:28,360
Because this has to be my point of this has to be what it pulls you for a long time.

566
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:33,560
But the bell could pull me just by being noisy or why being a distraction of your past.

567
00:51:33,561 --> 00:51:36,920
But when Google is noise to boosters, you will get a different path.

568
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,120
Well, it could destroy my past.

569
00:51:38,281 --> 00:51:40,120
Okay, how about beautiful?

570
00:51:40,121 --> 00:51:46,281
I mean, well, considering the guy's telegraphed object, when you see it as a beautiful woman, that's relative to certain interests.

571
00:51:47,241 --> 00:51:48,201
I can't deny that.

572
00:51:49,241 --> 00:51:51,561
That's the basic level of seeing a solid object there, I think.

573
00:51:51,801 --> 00:52:08,921
Yeah, I think that there's a basic level of seeing a solid object, on top of which there is the attractiveness of the object, whether God created the object, whether, you know, whether I'm threatened by the object, whether it reminds me of my mother, and all this of course.

574
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:14,520
But that doesn't deny that there could be something I share with animals and one-year-old infants.

575
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,081
Yeah.

576
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,960
It just means you want that.

577
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,801
You're talking about sea hounds.

578
00:52:19,801 --> 00:52:21,080
It's never your attention.

579
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,520
Something that we're explaining is the sense of all the time.

580
00:52:24,601 --> 00:52:27,961
And it's not even like a particular task.

581
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,960
Like the task is not always.

582
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,040
But do you think there always is a task?

583
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:36,560
But there always involving a team retention.

584
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,320
Let me get this in the pot.

585
00:52:36,761 --> 00:52:41,600
Well, I'm there.

586
00:52:43,281 --> 00:52:49,281
Being in the world, being in the world in Heidegger is a personal task.

587
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,560
I think in Merlot Quantity, he's clear, animals have it.

588
00:52:52,721 --> 00:52:53,840
Insects.

589
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,480
How much?

590
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,560
I mean, the existence is always trying to get a grip.

591
00:52:58,561 --> 00:53:02,481
And if that's a task, then everybody's always got a task.

592
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,160
But it's not personal.

593
00:53:04,801 --> 00:53:06,241
I won't talk about it anymore.

594
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:15,680
I'm just going to tell you everybody's going to tell me how I blew this lecture, but it'll be all your fault because I'm trying to go on.

595
00:53:15,681 --> 00:53:17,281
So I'm going to go on.

596
00:53:17,281 --> 00:53:18,721
Okay, let's see now.

597
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,840
3712.

598
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,600
I did the, I just did that.

599
00:53:24,161 --> 00:53:27,281
I'm going to, well, that one thing, I did the obscenity.

600
00:53:27,281 --> 00:53:28,801
Let's do the essay of it.

601
00:53:29,121 --> 00:53:29,920
A little further down.

602
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:39,201
The obscenity of the thing is unchallengeable presence and the perpetual absence into which it withdraws are two inseparable aspects of transcendence.

603
00:53:39,201 --> 00:53:40,961
I mean, that's the thing.

604
00:53:41,201 --> 00:53:57,201
Okay, I see now that I can leave this one for Sean, because the whole issue of the thing in the natural world is where he's going to try to tell you the level at which your personal tasks and your personal history and so forth are not what's at stake.

605
00:53:57,201 --> 00:54:00,561
And then you can see whether you believe it or not.

606
00:54:00,561 --> 00:54:11,041
Okay, I'm going on to the general conclusion of this chapter, which is always the big deal thing that's going to bring in optimal grip and all that.

607
00:54:12,801 --> 00:54:37,880
Being in the world at the top of 272, this is again where I started, seeming like five minutes ago, at the top of where I was saying how the body as a unified system, that's the body schema, the impersonal unified system is geared into dealing with the world as unified.

608
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:46,840
So he says the sight of sounds, the hearing of colors, we're back in synergistic stuff, comes about in the same way as the unity of the gaze to the two eyes.

609
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:49,481
That's getting the two images together.

610
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:58,921
Insofar as my body is not a collection of adjectives and organs, but a synergistic system, all the functions of which are exercised and linked together in the general action of being in the world.

611
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:04,200
That's, I mean, that's sort of the slogan, or one of the slogans that comes out of this chapter.

612
00:55:04,201 --> 00:55:06,921
The other one, I think, is in 279.

613
00:55:07,241 --> 00:55:08,680
Oh, that's the one I'm looking for.

614
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:10,201
Book, I have lots of blood today.

615
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,040
No wonder I put these things into it.

616
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:15,081
Two-thirds of the way down in 279.

617
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,920
Perception is always in the mode of the impersonal one.

618
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:29,081
See, we haven't totally wasted our time because now you can see how hard it is to understand what that's claiming and how important it is to understand what that's claiming.

619
00:55:29,081 --> 00:55:49,961
The issue is sort of when he says it's always in the mode of the impersonal one, I presume he's got to mean, we all agree at least, underlying whatever personal task and so forth and so forth, there is this mode of the impersonal one, unchanged by language and your tasks and your understanding of being and your culture.

620
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,721
That's what I read this passage to say.

621
00:55:51,721 --> 00:55:52,520
So let me read it.

622
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,681
Perception is always in the mode of the impersonal one.

623
00:55:54,681 --> 00:55:58,681
It's not a personal act enabling me to give a significance to my life.

624
00:55:58,681 --> 00:56:18,320
The person who, in sensory exploration, gives a past to the present and directs it towards the future is not myself as an autonomous subject, but myself insofar as I have a body and am able to look, rather than being a genuine history, perception ratifies and renews us as a prehistory.

625
00:56:13,641 --> 00:56:20,160
That's the quote I was looking for.

626
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,441
Now, that's the level that he wants to describe.

627
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:40,481
And my claim is, and I get to have the last word on this one, is that he wants to describe that level in this book anyway, as independent of what levels get laid on top of it, personal levels, historical levels, past levels, linguistic levels.

628
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:47,441
And it's something I think at this level that we share with animals and pre-linguistic children.

629
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:58,241
It's any entity that has a body enough like ours will see objects enough like ours because there will be the same impersonal one in their body schema.

630
00:56:58,241 --> 00:57:00,640
Now, that might be wrong, but that's fine if I'm wrong.

631
00:57:00,641 --> 00:57:06,641
Then you guys have got something you can write about and think about and challenge me on.

632
00:57:06,641 --> 00:57:08,480
I'm going to go on, okay?

633
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,400
Well, we're finally to the space chapter.

634
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,401
Luckily, we have Thursday also.

635
00:57:13,201 --> 00:57:15,200
And here's the past things I was looking for.

636
00:57:15,201 --> 00:57:17,281
Bit by bit, I find what I put in here.

637
00:57:17,281 --> 00:57:19,440
Things not Merloponte.

638
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,880
I knew I had a list.

639
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,000
We're not big lists.

640
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,681
I only found two so far.

641
00:57:23,681 --> 00:57:26,801
But something to warn you about as you go into this chapter.

642
00:57:26,801 --> 00:57:29,441
It stopped now in the space chapter.

643
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:37,360
It stopped being Merrill-Ponte about two, four, six lines from the bottom of the first page of it, 283.

644
00:57:37,681 --> 00:57:38,880
Kant tried.

645
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,440
And it's not, usually, it's hard.

646
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:47,921
You need me to warn you, because it just sort of goes off the rails without him even without him even telling you who he's talking about.

647
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,400
But Kant is what he's talking about.

648
00:57:50,400 --> 00:58:05,480
And Kant's field space, until about 15 lines from the bottom of 284, where it says, and according to Kant himself, of all knowledge connected with space, and of that.

649
00:58:05,641 --> 00:58:13,481
Now Merle Panchi comes in and says, it's true that we are faced with the alternative either of perceiving things in space or conceiving in so-and-so.

650
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,880
And is it true?

651
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,640
Wait, wait, is it true?

652
00:58:17,641 --> 00:58:19,160
No, yeah, he's questioning it.

653
00:58:19,161 --> 00:58:19,801
I see.

654
00:58:19,801 --> 00:58:20,360
Yeah.

655
00:58:20,601 --> 00:58:22,120
I walk like let's say.

656
00:58:22,121 --> 00:58:23,320
Kant has been saying that.

657
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:29,241
But now he's answering Kant and saying, is it true that we're faced with the alternative of perceiving things in space?

658
00:58:29,241 --> 00:58:38,840
Or if we reflect and try to discover the significance of our experience, of conceiving space is the invisible system governing the acts of unification performed by a constituted mind.

659
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:42,441
All that's critiqued with a recent talk, and you don't need to know.

660
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:49,001
Does not the experience of space provide a basis for its unity by means of an entirely different kind of synthesis?

661
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:56,920
Again, that's a synthesis in quotes, if you think that Kant's the big geosynthesizer.

662
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,560
But he's saying Kant has his idea of synthesis.

663
00:58:59,561 --> 00:59:16,920
We can call it a synthesis if we want, but there's a whole different way of experiencing space than this idea that Kant has, that you either experience things in it or you have what he calls the pure form of intuition, which is the global grasp of something called space.

664
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,201
Just don't think about Kant.

665
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,401
Go on.

666
00:59:19,721 --> 00:59:21,801
Say, all now I'm going to read my stuff for a minute.

667
00:59:21,801 --> 00:59:30,761
All the arguments in the space chapter, and maybe in the whole book, depend on the organisms seeking not just a good grit, but a best one.

668
00:59:30,761 --> 00:59:32,680
Ooh, I was contradicting myself for a while.

669
00:59:33,081 --> 00:59:36,601
At least, so I think I'll take out this in the whole book.

670
00:59:36,601 --> 00:59:46,081
But I think the arguments in this chapter depend on the organism seeking not just a good grip, but the best one.

671
00:59:43,721 --> 00:59:50,640
And the chapter shows how important the idea of maximum grip is for narrow function.

672
00:59:51,201 --> 00:59:57,441
It's necessary for us to be able to achieve a maximum grip, not just tend toward it, achieve it.

673
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:03,441
In order to experience things as having a certain size, being a certain distance, and moving.

674
01:00:04,081 --> 01:00:06,000
That's pretty serious, I mean.

675
01:00:06,641 --> 01:00:08,721
And I think that's the claim.

676
01:00:08,721 --> 01:00:12,080
That that's what I'm going to get to show you more next time.

677
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:26,721
First, I'm just going to give you some maximum grip quotes to keep in mind as you read this and try to decide sort of what a maximum grip is and whether you have to have it in order to have size, distance, and motion.

678
01:00:26,721 --> 01:00:28,720
And I guess I have to add orientation.

679
01:00:28,721 --> 01:00:33,921
I'll tell you in a minute, or next time, why I think orientation is a special code.

680
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:38,960
But before we break up, I have to tell you what to worry about in the orientation.

681
01:00:39,281 --> 01:00:40,801
Maybe we could read something first.

682
01:00:40,801 --> 01:00:45,440
From 177, the end of the synthesis of one's own body.

683
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,401
We read it already, but I think we have to read it again now.

684
01:00:48,721 --> 01:00:54,721
And notice this is one of those places where the punchline is right at the end, about 15 lines from the end.

685
01:00:54,721 --> 01:00:59,600
Whether a system of motor or perceptual powers, our body is not an object of an I think.

686
01:00:59,601 --> 01:01:03,360
It's a grouping of lived through meanings which moves toward an equilibrium.

687
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:09,281
So far, you don't know whether it arrives or not, but it's important that it's always got to be moving toward an equilibrium at least.

688
01:01:09,281 --> 01:01:11,440
Sometimes a new cluster of meanings is formed.

689
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:15,201
Our formal movements are integrated into fresh motor activity and so forth.

690
01:01:15,201 --> 01:01:22,001
Our natural powers come together in a richer meaning, which hitherto has been foreshadowed in the perceptual or practical field.

691
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:29,481
That's the storm on the horizon tension story, and which has made itself felt in our experience by no more than a certain lack.

692
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,721
That's lack of equilibrium.

693
01:01:32,281 --> 01:01:38,441
And which, by its coming, suddenly reshuffles the elements of our equilibrium and fulfills a blind expectation.

694
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,440
That's if you haven't got a goal.

695
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:45,721
A blind expectation is something's going to come around which is better than what it is now.

696
01:01:46,121 --> 01:01:53,320
Some way of experiencing something is not as good as it could be, and there must be a way to make it better.

697
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,320
That's the blind expectation.

698
01:01:55,561 --> 01:02:02,201
I'm just going to read you my favorite maximum good quotes because we need them in our minds as we go through this.

699
01:02:02,681 --> 01:02:09,480
Okay, 292, 92, about five lines down, maybe more like eight.

700
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:20,360
My body is geared into the world when my perception presents, and this is one we haven't ever talked about, I think, presents me with a spectacle as varied and as clearly articulated as possible.

701
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,880
Those are the two important dimensions.

702
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,481
He has lots of names for it.

703
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:33,640
Clarity and risk and when my motor intentions, as they unfold, receive the responses they expect from the world, that's the third.

704
01:02:33,641 --> 01:02:36,920
There are three criteria that go together.

705
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:40,840
You have to optimize them to get the optimal grip.

706
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:44,040
And they all have trade-offs, so you can't optimize.

707
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:48,681
And if you optimize only one of them all the way, you get rid of the other.

708
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:53,320
But so you want to get them all as much optimized as possible.

709
01:02:53,320 --> 01:03:13,401
Okay, so we and then when my motor intentions they're told receive the responses they expect from the world, this maximum sharpness of perception and action points clearly to a perceptual ground, a basis of my life, a general setting, that's with the impersonal again, and which my body, it can coexist with the world.

710
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:22,960
Okay, that he should be doing maximum talk here because he's entering the space chapter isn't surprising, because as I almost blew it, then got clear.

711
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,680
Maximum plays a big role in the space check.

712
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:29,360
Now let's see, 293, I say.

713
01:03:31,601 --> 01:03:33,601
Important stuff on it, but not that.

714
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:36,241
So let me go on and do another one.

715
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:39,761
Three steps way off on three steps.

716
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:44,001
It could be, you know, anyway, that's typical of the way the book is written.

717
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,121
So how about four lines down on 352?

718
01:03:47,121 --> 01:03:54,481
For each object, for each picture in the art gallery, there is an optimum distance of which it requires to be seen.

719
01:03:54,801 --> 01:03:57,840
And I want to say, I mean, I guess Rick raises the interesting question.

720
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:02,481
Is it required to be seen that way because you have some specific task and interest in it?

721
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:09,920
Or is it, if you don't, if your task and interest is just seeing the picture, then the picture tells you where to stand.

722
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:10,560
I don't know.

723
01:04:10,561 --> 01:04:19,921
A direction view from which it valves the most of itself at a shorter or greater distance with an area of perception blurred through excess or deficiency.

724
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:27,041
We therefore tend toward the maximum, there it is again, of visibility and seek a better focus as with a microscope.

725
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:29,441
That's another important one.

726
01:04:29,761 --> 01:04:37,200
Now, I want to say one more thing for five minutes, just because I want you not to be confused about something.

727
01:04:37,201 --> 01:04:38,400
Because first I have to see something.

728
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,000
Do I have to read 342?

729
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,520
You won't read that.

730
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:47,601
Okay, the first thing he goes into in the space track is the craziest and the hardest.

731
01:04:47,601 --> 01:04:51,360
And you don't really have to read it if you don't want to.

732
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:53,840
It's about up-down orientation.

733
01:04:53,840 --> 01:05:05,881
He's got lots to say about the fact that if you wear goggles and invert your experience of the world so that the image on your retina don't get confused is already inverted, as you probably know.

734
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:09,160
And that's how you see the world up normally.

735
01:05:09,161 --> 01:05:13,481
But you can wear goggles that make the image uninverted.

736
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:16,441
And then that makes your experience of the world inverted.

737
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:23,641
But if you move around a lot for a while, over about a week, the world re-inverts and it looks normal again.

738
01:05:23,641 --> 01:05:30,601
And he has lots to say about that, what that shows, and the stages you go through and it happens.

739
01:05:30,601 --> 01:05:42,360
And I want to say that it's probably all wrong and thereby very confusing.

740
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:45,561
And the way it's wrong is very interesting.

741
01:05:45,561 --> 01:05:49,640
And if there were time, I would go through it and talk about it.

742
01:05:49,641 --> 01:05:51,241
If I get time next time, I will.

743
01:05:51,241 --> 01:06:10,840
But I want you to have the basic idea as you read it or reread it, if you want to read it at all, whether he can get away with explaining the fact that we've got up-down-oriented experience, there is an up and a down in our experience, without evergreening in gravity.

744
01:06:11,561 --> 01:06:28,040
He claims that somehow, and it gets very worrying and funny as we start saying wilder and wilder things, somehow up-downness is just there in the basic being of things, and you just finally got to get in sync with it.

745
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:35,961
Well, it's not some mysterious up-down, it's gravity that's there, and you either get out of sync with it and you get in sync with it.

746
01:06:36,281 --> 01:06:38,360
The puzzle is the reverse.

747
01:06:38,681 --> 01:06:41,240
How, given that gravity is driven.

748
01:06:41,241 --> 01:06:47,601
You could reverse this with these goggles and feel at home in the world upside down.

749
01:06:43,641 --> 01:06:49,440
I mean, that is a puzzle, it seems to me.

750
01:06:49,601 --> 01:06:52,161
Olivia is getting upset, talking to me about this later.

751
01:06:52,161 --> 01:07:06,161
But it turns out that this stuff with who's the guy who does the Stratton goggles have been repeated by a guy named Kohler who got so he could even ride a motorcycle in traffic with his upside-down glasses on.

752
01:07:06,161 --> 01:07:09,201
And you can get totally at home in the world.

753
01:07:09,201 --> 01:07:19,441
But the amazing thing is, so the two questions to read is questions as you read this up-the-down part, which is so hard and puzzling.

754
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:24,401
How in the world does he manage to talk about up-down without ever mentioning gravity?

755
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:36,960
And how, given that there is gravity, does the inverting lenses enable you to live perfectly okay, even though you are now sort of well, I think I know the answer, by the way.

756
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:45,200
I think the answer is something like that: your coping skills all get reconfigured.

757
01:07:45,201 --> 01:07:54,081
I mean, it's so that you, when you lift something, you lift it down, so to speak, and it feels hard to lift things down.

758
01:07:54,081 --> 01:07:56,480
It's like the what's the blind spot?

759
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:56,960
What's this?

760
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,000
The mystery spot.

761
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,681
How many have been to the mystery spot here?

762
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:09,521
You know, where if by some perceptual illusion, it looks like things are, the gravity doesn't normally apply, and you get so you can live in it.

763
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:34,681
Anyway, I don't know myself what he thinks, because I think he never tells us why, how he thinks of it, that our experience for coping with it gets us to be able to cope with things, even though the perceptual, namely the these goggles, have put us out of sync with the vertical field, namely gravity.

764
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:43,320
And it's got something to do with the amazing plasticity of the coping body that we're able to do it.

765
01:08:43,321 --> 01:08:52,360
But I find this section completely insane because he's like you tried to tell the story, but you leave out one of the crucial elements.

766
01:08:52,361 --> 01:08:55,240
And then he says absolutely weird things.

767
01:08:55,240 --> 01:09:05,721
Well, anyway, this happens, just so you know, between the body of 284 and where depth starts at the bottom of 294.

768
01:09:05,721 --> 01:09:12,200
I think it's fun to read it, and I think you should read it, and you should be asking yourself, what in the world is he doing?

769
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,120
Is he trying to do it without gravity?

770
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,761
Does it matter that he's trying to do it without gravity?

771
01:09:16,761 --> 01:09:22,840
Does he have an answer to this whole issue of how we experience the up-down without it?

772
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:24,280
I don't know.

773
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:34,440
But it turns out that it's done by magic, the very end of the 296, where he stops, where he finishes.

774
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:39,880
And I think that's a bad sign, but maybe that's just a metaphor.

775
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:47,801
Anyway, next time, I'm not going to do the space thing because I don't know how to do the space, the orientation up-down chapter.

776
01:09:47,801 --> 01:09:53,721
I don't want to sort of spend all your time showing you how weird it is, and I don't know how to make coherent sense out of it.

777
01:09:53,721 --> 01:10:00,440
I'm going to start with depth on 297 and go on to the end of the space chapter.

778
01:10:00,441 --> 01:10:02,840
Hopefully, you know, that's a long way to go.

779
01:10:03,401 --> 01:10:14,160
And as a possible paper topic, I would love to have someone who thinks they've got a grip on you and explain what's going on in the orientation chapter.

780
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:16,320
So don't do it unless you really know what you're doing.

781
01:10:16,321 --> 01:10:17,360
Talk to your TA.

782
01:10:13,641 --> 01:10:17,601
Okay.
