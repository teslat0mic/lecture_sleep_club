1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,160
The psychologist's hybrid thinking runs the risk of introducing into the description belonging to the objective world, reducing into the description the relationships belonging to the objective world.

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,640
So that's what it looks like he's thinking about what Wernheimer is thinking.

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,359
But then he goes on for pure description.

4
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,919
And Gestalt theory claims to be a description.

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,320
The contiguity and resemblance of stimuli don't precede the constitution of the whole.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,920
Now this is an important sentence.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,359
Good form is not brought about because it was good.

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,079
It would be good in itself in some metaphysical heaven.

9
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,680
It's good because it comes into being in our experience.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,439
This he says every once in a while.

11
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:52,079
There's no reason why a certain figure is a stable figure, or that our perception tends to, for instance, separate out the trees from the mass of the boats.

12
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:07,039
It's the fact that we organize our experience that way is what the Gestalt people call a good experience, a balanced experience, the experience that's come to its kind of stable form.

13
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:09,919
And there's nothing that it's conforming to.

14
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:17,919
No rule or principle or way of stating why this is the best Gestalt.

15
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:20,640
It's the best Gestalt because it looks like the best Gestalt.

16
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:26,479
And other Gestalts tend to be grouped as less good by anybody looking at it.

17
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,119
And that's what he's saying here.

18
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:42,399
And they shouldn't have tried to find objective reasons for these experiences that come together in this way.

19
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:53,119
The way they come together, the Gestaltists should describe, but there's no story why experience has to come together in this way, why it's better in any way except that it looks better.

20
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,520
That's what that sentence says.

21
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,960
And it'll come back again and again, that there are no norms outside the Gestalt psychology.

22
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:06,280
The Gestalt psychology just describes the norms that are in our experience, period.

23
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,039
Now, where are we?

24
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,360
Good evening.

25
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:27,399
So he sums up at the bottom of 19: if we confine ourselves to phenomena, the unity of the thing in perception is not arrived at by association, but is the condition for association, and as such proceeds through the limitations which establish and verify it, and indeed proceeds itself.

26
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,680
That's the story about how once you've got it, you've got all you need.

27
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:39,719
So, and here's that business put most clearly at the top of 23.

28
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:48,839
The appeal to memory presupposes what it's supposed to explain: the patterning of data, the imposition of meaning on a chaos of sense data.

29
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:58,999
Now, the punchline: no sooner is the recollection of memories made possible than it becomes superfluous, since the work it is being asked to do is already done.

30
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:00,999
I've explained that, right?

31
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:09,399
That is, if it looks like it's the front of a household, you can associate it to the back, then it already looks like it's a front of a house.

32
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,720
There's nothing for you to do about it.

33
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,600
You've done it.

34
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:22,439
And this is all part of the basic notion, which I want to keep reminding you: that the whole determines what counts as the element.

35
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:26,360
That's always there in the background of what he's thinking.

36
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,360
Uh I think I've read it anyway.

37
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,399
Well, he says it at the bottom of 18, in effect.

38
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:34,279
I'd read it already.

39
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:42,640
There are there are not arbitrary data which set about combining into a thing because de facto proximities or likenesses cause them to associate.

40
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:50,080
It's on the contrary because we perceive a grouping as a thing that the analytic attitude can discern likeness and proximities.

41
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,719
That is, for them, always the whole determines what counts as the part and the whole determines what counts as similar to what.

42
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:06,960
And if you look in an analytic way at that, that is taking it apart into the elements, you lose the whole, you lose the experience altogether.

43
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:19,279
Now, there's this beautiful, the beautiful boat example is, I just don't think I have time to read it, but on page 20, it's where he talks, he describes in detail what it's like to see something.

44
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,439
See, what he's doing on 20, I should say.

45
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,119
And I think I quote this already already.

46
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,440
I do write the boat example already, since the slightly.

47
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,879
And here well, here it is spelled out.

48
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:33,280
But what's interesting about it is he slows down experience.

49
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,040
He's so good at finding examples.

50
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,559
Last time I remember talking about the museum example mostly.

51
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:46,399
But here he's slowing down the example of coming to perceive an object in which you start with what he calls a vague expectation.

52
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:53,119
And then it it stabilizes into the ship and the mass.

53
00:04:53,119 --> 00:05:04,639
And then as he says right after vague expectation in the middle of the paragraph, only afterwards did I recognize as justification for the change the resemblance and contiguity of what I call stimuli.

54
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:12,920
That is, we see it's only in once you've already seen it as mass and trees.

55
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,360
Then you can see the trees are similar to the trees and the masts is similar to the mass.

56
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,559
But that you have to, first you get the sense that there's some way to gestalt it.

57
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:29,800
Then it falls into place, presumably on the basis of past experience you've had with mast and trees.

58
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:36,199
And then you can see, only then the whole determines what counts as the similarities.

59
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:40,040
And what's interesting about it is that this supposedly happens all the time.

60
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,119
Every time you walk in here and see the left turn, you do it.

61
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:50,600
But you're so used to seeing left turns in general, and in this case, this one in particular, that it only takes a few milliseconds to do it.

62
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,279
Whereas when you see a weird scene like that, it takes a long time.

63
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,119
I worried about that, and I thought maybe this is philosophy craziness.

64
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:04,519
You ought to be very careful not to say, well, when you don't experience it all, it must be because it happens very fast.

65
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:06,360
So I worry about that.

66
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,920
So I asked Walter Freeman, who's always there, thank goodness, in the background, doing his grain marillopontee.

67
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:18,439
And he said, he told me how many microseconds it takes to recognize an ordinary familiar object.

68
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:20,680
And he said, yeah, that's not long.

69
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,999
He is just slowing down.

70
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:30,519
What we can actually read off is going on during these microseconds that the object stabilizes.

71
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:36,519
Well, Bertie, the exact example of that he's walking along the shore towards a ship.

72
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,519
So it seems like building his nipple far away.

73
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,360
You like to find it slowing down.

74
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,240
No, no, I don't think he is.

75
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:43,959
No, I don't think he is.

76
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:47,800
Isn't that funny that everything you talk about turns into a puzzle?

77
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
I think he's standing there.

78
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,759
But look, he says, I walk along the shore towards the ship.

79
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:53,720
You're right about that.

80
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,319
But I still think that it's not because he's getting...

81
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:57,960
Well, you're right.

82
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,440
You're right.

83
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:00,200
As I approach, you're absolutely right.

84
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:04,360
Yeah, there's at a distance, it all is confused.

85
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,639
As I get closer, it sorts itself out.

86
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,240
I think the tension increases as you get closer, up to the point where it sorts itself out, like a storm.

87
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,280
Isn't that what happens?

88
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,639
At some point, it deepens.

89
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:14,879
Yeah.

90
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:20,399
Oh, the thing suddenly falls into place, like the storm which has been brewing hits.

91
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,160
And then it's all organized.

92
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,119
That's right.

93
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:28,720
And that doesn't disagree with what I'm saying, except that I didn't mention that, but it's true.

94
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,160
It doesn't just magically...

95
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,759
See, it could have.

96
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,200
He slowed it down by my walking from a distance.

97
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,240
That's right.

98
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,999
Just as in a museum, he slows it down by walking up to, by looking at unfamiliar paintings.

99
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:43,999
But it could just be you're staring.

100
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:48,720
Remember, he mentions the rabbit and the hat and the trees, that kind of puzzle?

101
00:07:48,719 --> 00:08:02,480
You're staring at this kind of puzzle, and you know that it doesn't look quite normal, and you know it's really something else, and you've got what he would call a vague expectation, and then, oh, it gets to be sorted out, and there's the rabbit and the trees.

102
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,119
He could have told that story.

103
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,720
The story is of seeing something unstable.

104
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,119
The rabbit and the tree and the hat are pretty stable.

105
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:12,320
I think we need a third one.

106
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:18,240
What we want is something that, without you having to walk toward it, looks unstable.

107
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,639
It happens all the time, the Dali painting.

108
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,959
A Dali painting can do that, right?

109
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:32,160
Dali's very good at that, where it looks weird, sort of, and then you see it's two ladies with strange hats, as well as George Washington or whatever that one is.

110
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,599
But also, I wish there's a challenge for next time.

111
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,400
This happens.

112
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,000
I enjoy noticing it because it happens a lot if you once start reading Narala Punches.

113
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:56,999
In the simplest situations, you see things that look puzzling and not quite right, and it turns out to be some somebody's put something where it isn't supposed to be, or the cat has or something, and you get this unstable thing and then it falls into place.

114
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,800
It's not as as unusual as we make it seem.

115
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:20,520
He's got another one that may be not so unusual, but again, I think you're walking along in that, where you see what looks like a patch of a stone on the path, and you're all prepared to step on it as a hard supporting stone, and it then it turns it turns into a patch of sunlight.

116
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:24,680
But that's not so good either because it was looking happily like a stone.

117
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,520
I can't think of any, but I'll work on it.

118
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,000
Yeah.

119
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,120
I just want to talk about that.

120
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:36,439
I guess that because this is a very common experience, we don't reasonably mean that it always happens even when we don't have things.

121
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:40,120
Well, I think we, yes, I think that plus Lawler's saying so.

122
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,639
I would I don't think it's it wouldn't be fair to just get one neuroscientist on your side.

123
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,680
So he tells you, yes, this happens a lot, but I think he needs a claim.

124
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,960
He makes a stronger claim.

125
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,000
Let's get that clear.

126
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,040
Not only does it happen a lot, it happens all the time.

127
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,680
Your experience is constantly having to be stabilized.

128
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,079
You don't think he thinks that, or you don't think you could think that?

129
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:06,120
Well, I don't see how could think that it's just if we don't experience that.

130
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,199
You know, how could it be if there is any experience called you know?

131
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:13,239
If you walk out of the brain, it's trying to speak about what you're seeing.

132
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:17,800
Maybe the rain finds itself undecided about what you're seeing all the time.

133
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,559
But of course, you don't experience it.

134
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:21,160
Well, I think it's unconsciously.

135
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,600
Well, I think well, I I I I this is the problem I was dealing with.

136
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:31,319
I think he thinks if you experience it so fast you don't notice it.

137
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:36,360
And only on some circumstances can you slow it down enough to see it happening.

138
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,680
But I think he thinks it's happening all the time.

139
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:51,520
Except when you're s when seeing familiar objects in familiar places, it doesn't take you long enough to see it, to get it together, that you can notice it.

140
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:59,680
But it so he has to give you breakdown, well, not quite breakdown, but hard cases in which it takes you a while.

141
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,160
But I think it's his claim that that's how experience works.

142
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:11,920
It's constantly removing from this kind of instability to getting a clear grip on things.

143
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:24,640
Keep your eye open for whether maybe I'm making this up, but I can't imagine, I mean, I don't understand how it could be otherwise for him, because we are composing the text of the world, to quote him.

144
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,120
Now I'm just describing, I'm just taking the metaphor.

145
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,680
We're always composing the text of the world, I think.

146
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,960
It was just that you've got to slow down with those nasty foods, the composing.

147
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:41,119
Well, I thought that your view, Kent, is that most of the time we're not thinking about this thing.

148
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,640
We're just interacting with the world.

149
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,200
Absolutely.

150
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,960
Well, essentially, spoken from the world have to w the learners drawing up.

151
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:55,440
Ah, well, that's it's it when you do the breakdown thing, then it's it's abnormal and that you're puzzling and you're paying attention.

152
00:11:55,439 --> 00:11:59,360
But the puzzling paying attention, ooh, this gets us right to the attention chapter.

153
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:23,280
I mean, the question is, sort of to what extent your puzzling kind of paying attention reveals something that's going on all the time, only it's almost totally marginal and it happens very fast, but it's always you composing a meaning meaningful object out of uh what is uh not clear.

154
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:27,480
Let me put on call to the attention.

155
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:29,240
Yeah, this doesn't even stop and think about it.

156
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,640
I mean, it belongs to more or less clarity.

157
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:39,080
In this example of the museum in painting, you don't stop and think, huh, the things don't look right.

158
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:41,480
You just automatically move closer.

159
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:49,319
You don't think about it, but it is part of your phenomenal experience of the painting, is you're moving about trying to get the best possible view of it.

160
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:51,000
You're trying to avoid the glare.

161
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:53,480
I think that's where you think is constantly going on.

162
00:12:53,559 --> 00:13:02,199
That is constitutive of the experience of masculinity trees or the painting of you looking at a museum or looking around to work.

163
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:04,040
I think that's good.

164
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:10,680
And in the museum one, I shouldn't have said that you're sort of puzzling about it in a loved sort of way.

165
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,840
You're just feeling uneasy about it and moving around to get it clearer.

166
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:21,800
And that you don't have to reflect on it as a puzzle to do that.

167
00:13:22,439 --> 00:13:23,480
You said it well.

168
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:24,680
You just are doing it.

169
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:35,479
Then he reflects and asks you to remember what it was like with a slack of storm and that it was a puzzle in a step and that it all of a sudden got solved.

170
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:40,360
That's him giving you a much more reflective view of it than you have when you're doing it.

171
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:41,880
That sounds right.

172
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,040
Okay, back to where we are.

173
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:46,520
So we did the boat example in a hurry.

174
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,319
So how do we do it?

175
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:52,040
I jumped ahead, but I'll read you a quote.

176
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,400
Well, we do it.

177
00:13:53,400 --> 00:14:01,239
That is, how do we get an experience of meaningful objects because we're already in this meaningful world?

178
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,280
Here's a place where he's saying that at the bottom of twenty-five.

179
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,920
Consciousness can, about 10 lines from the bottom, in the course of time modify the structure of its surroundings.

180
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,040
He's going to talk about that.

181
00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:14,559
Well, we want to know, let's back up.

182
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:25,920
We want to know how, by its own voicatality and without carrying complementary material into mythical unconscious, consciousness can, in the course of time, modify the structure of its surroundings.

183
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:44,880
How at every moment its former experience is present to it in the form of a horizon which it can reopen if it chooses to take the horizon as a theme of knowledge and an act of recollection, but which can equally leave it on the fringe of experience and then immediately provides the perceived with an atmosphere and significance.

184
00:14:44,880 --> 00:15:03,839
All that is to say that the meaningful, relevant similarities and so forth are there on the fringes of consciousness or in the background and so forth, but they notice they provide the perceived with a present atmosphere and significance.

185
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,760
I mean it's because all this past experience isn't remember.

186
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:22,000
It's really part of the visual field on the horizon, on the periphery, in the background, that it's leading you in some direction and giving you some relevance.

187
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,040
Let me see if we go further.

188
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:32,960
A field which is always at the disposal of consciousness and which for that very reason surrounds and envelops its perceptions, an atmosphere or horizon, if you will.

189
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,840
A given sets which provide it with a temporal structure.

190
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,640
I'm going to say more about that later.

191
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:49,040
But but right now, I just want to say there's always this background in terms of which whatever's in the foreground is getting its significance, according to him.

192
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,480
Um do I really want to correct the mistranslation?

193
00:15:53,719 --> 00:16:04,040
Well, in 24, I have to tell you, there's a lot of mistranslation, or at least one word keeps getting mistranslated about a third of the way down.

194
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:17,400
It's where it's all about sensation, sort of sensation, and the next, and then how experience in which the meaning exactly fits the sensation.

195
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,520
See what we're talking about?

196
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,160
Let me back up.

197
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,840
The illusion deceives us and passes itself off as genuine.

198
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:29,800
Perception, precisely in those cases where the meaning originates in the source of sensation.

199
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,559
I don't even know what that means.

200
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,520
The French doesn't say sensation.

201
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,080
The French says, it doesn't say sensation.

202
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,439
It says sensible.

203
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:48,600
The sensible is his word for sense experience, but it's meaningful sense experience, not sensation, which is impression.

204
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:52,360
And nothing, no meaning originates from an impression.

205
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,680
And then he goes on in the next sentence.

206
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,560
It intimates that privileged experience in which the meaning exactly fits the sensation.

207
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,080
No meaning fits the sensation.

208
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,359
He's just been arguing that.

209
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,840
The sensation has no meaning.

210
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,439
Again, it's the sensible.

211
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:07,560
And he goes on again.

212
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:14,279
It implies this normal perception and therefore cannot spring from any contact between sensation and memory.

213
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:15,959
Well, there, that's also sans sible.

214
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:16,680
He could have been.

215
00:17:16,999 --> 00:17:18,839
And they all are.

216
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,120
Until you get the word sensation in the right place.

217
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:22,920
A little further.

218
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,239
The projection of memories makes nonsense of both.

219
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:30,360
For if a thing perceived, we're made up of sensations and memories, there is sans ación.

220
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,519
That is, those are the impressions.

221
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:53,599
Well, it's too bad, and I don't know how often it happens, that you've got to distinguish between impressions, which are sensations, which in French is sensation, and perceptual experience, which is meaningful, and which is what you're having all the time, and which he does think exists.

222
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:02,079
In fact, he's got a whole chapter on it, and that's the sensible, and it's a disaster that the translator doesn't see that that's an important distinction.

223
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:06,400
I don't remember any place, I didn't see any place else where this bad thing happened.

224
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,080
So, but keep your eyes open.

225
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:16,400
If you read something that looks wrong, come and talk to me about it in office hours, and we'll look it up in the French and see about it.

226
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:18,640
Okay, on order.

227
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,279
Yeah.

228
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,599
Meaning or quality sounds too reference.

229
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,319
Yeah, I always, I shouldn't say meaning, although he does sometimes.

230
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:27,279
Again, it's sort of sans, it's significance.

231
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:46,400
Where the minimal sense of meaning for him, which is the one he's using, is something that points beyond itself, that gets whatever value it has or perceptual quality it has or something from the whole, like the front of the house looking like the front of a house because of the bag.

232
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,799
And it does seem strange to talk about meaning.

233
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:58,080
And he doesn't, the word again is sans, so that there's got to be something that refers beyond.

234
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:11,040
That's what keeps it from being a mere impression, which has no position in a hole and no reference to other parts of the experience that make it what it is.

235
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,400
Does that help any?

236
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:13,439
No.

237
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,480
Okay, why not?

238
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,400
I guess I didn't get your problem.

239
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,839
Significance in the sense of signification, like it's actually doing like a reference.

240
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:22,879
No, exactly.

241
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,400
It's not.

242
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,199
That's I thought, I thought I understood you, but I haven't answered you.

243
00:19:26,439 --> 00:19:40,840
Meaning, and if significance, if those mean reference, if that means that you've got some kind of intentional content and it's referring to something beyond that content, that's much too conceptual.

244
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,640
But he thinks, take the figure on the ground.

245
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:52,280
What he wants to say, the figure doesn't refer to the background under it, but it looks the way it looks because it looks like it has a background under it.

246
00:19:52,279 --> 00:20:01,239
And it doesn't refer to the edges being more dense than the center in the sense of somehow pointing at them like objects.

247
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:08,920
It just looks the way it looks because it's got, because it's experienced as a spot on ground.

248
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:15,000
There's a kind of it isn't even intentionality.

249
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:18,599
I mean, it isn't even body intentionality, which he does believe in.

250
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,160
It's something even more primitive than intentionality, because intentionality can fail.

251
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,279
That's part of what it is to have intentional content.

252
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:31,080
This isn't like, it isn't like you get it wrong.

253
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,999
I mean, you can't look behind the spot and see, wow, there was no background under the spot after all.

254
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,559
It's just built into the look of the spot, that there's a background behind it.

255
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:45,320
Does that help any?

256
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:52,279
So is the significance of thoughts, does it mean signification with like intentionality?

257
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:52,680
No.

258
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,719
Is it closer to background-ish relevance?

259
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,680
Yeah, it's the it doesn't, the date doesn't help.

260
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,079
It's it's the way if the let's try this.

261
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:21,920
If the if the whole determines the meaning of the parts, then every part in some sense announces, I'm using his funny language, more than it actually shows because it already has to sh i in its showing it shows its position in the whole.

262
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:28,239
The way the note middle C when heard in a certain melody isn't just, let's try this.

263
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:35,839
I'm the note middle C, if you hear it in this melody, has a certain quality, and if you hear it in another melody, it has another quality.

264
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:50,160
In that funny sense, it refers to the melody, but it obviously doesn't have intentional content of any sort that points to the melody and if you could be refuted by the melody failing to be what it was, it's more minimal.

265
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:57,519
It's just that these experiences are not self-sufficient, but are what they are because of a whole field.

266
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:59,999
If that helps him, give it a try.

267
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:00,959
But I'm glad you asked.

268
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:11,839
I think that's very important, that there's this level of what he thinks of as meaning or significance, this word sounds, but he doesn't think that it's reference.

269
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,239
He doesn't think that it's intentionality.

270
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:16,160
It's more basic than that.

271
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:21,360
And it points beyond itself, and that's why it looks like reference.

272
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:28,800
That it doesn't point beyond itself in the way that intentional content in the mind points beyond itself at something in the world.

273
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:31,120
I was trying to say somebody's using sniff this way.

274
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,599
Heidegger's using concept, but this notion.

275
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:41,760
Yes, but I'd rather do it, I mean, if that helps, the Heungarians good, but I want to do it in such a minimal way, like a spot, you know.

276
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:47,439
You know, Heidegger doesn't have a story about the significance of a blaw, a little ink spot on a black piece of paper.

277
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:57,080
Merono-Ponte wants to get to that absolute minimum of interrelatedness, who knows, we have no word for it.

278
00:22:57,479 --> 00:22:58,759
But it's important.

279
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:02,680
And he knows, I mean, it's just basic to his ink spot.

280
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,799
He's part of the world.

281
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,279
You just haven't really developed.

282
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:20,839
Okay, but just as soon as it's there, the ink spot on the left page, already it's got the edges, it's already got denser on the hardy edges, it's already got some sense that there's something it's covering up.

283
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,920
That's just minimal.

284
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:25,800
I wonder if I should get into this.

285
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:26,839
That raises it.

286
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:31,239
What I've been thinking of this week is my most puzzling question.

287
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:34,839
Let's do it right here when we're talking about sets.

288
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,759
There is a kind of body intentionality.

289
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:41,319
I'll follow out what you guys are raising.

290
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,719
Let's talk about looking at the front of a house.

291
00:23:43,719 --> 00:23:48,519
When you look at the front of a house, Meryl Fonte says, it looks thick.

292
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:53,160
It looks like there's a back that's present but concealed.

293
00:23:53,160 --> 00:24:07,000
Or to take his extreme funny example, that he says twice in our reading, the last time and this time, that I have an experience of what's behind my back, of the room back there, which is present and concealed.

294
00:24:06,999 --> 00:24:11,160
This time not by something between me and it, but because I'm looking in the other direction.

295
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:17,880
But it's present, and that's the same for him, and the underlines present as the way the background is under the spot.

296
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,239
And that's all an extremely important phenomenon for him.

297
00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:23,640
And he thinks that he's the only one that's going to account for it.

298
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,999
Neither the intellectualist nor the empiricist can.

299
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:32,599
Now, and how is it that, I'll do it first with the house, because that's easiest.

300
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,599
Why does the house look thick?

301
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,880
Well, luckily, because I'm set to go around it.

302
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:42,160
That's why the word set here sort of sets me off talking about this.

303
00:24:42,479 --> 00:25:02,239
I mean, it's because I'm already, my body is already not only ready to go around it, but in a certain sense, already beginning to go around it in the way that I wouldn't, I mean, that it wouldn't throw me off or anything to just go around it.

304
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:08,239
It's not like I'm ready to, I'm not ready to just do cartwheels.

305
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:12,799
I'm ready to walk around the objects when I need to.

306
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,199
And so I'm set to do something.

307
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:16,879
I really want to say something stronger.

308
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,360
I'm really already coping with it.

309
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:30,160
If it's in my experience as a house, and if I'm interested in, say, going inside or going to the back, even before I get there, I'm already coping with it.

310
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,080
I have to give you a feel for that.

311
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:40,640
We'll come back to this, but there's this talking Meryl-Fontee about how if I'm going to leave the room, my hand is magically at the doorknob, he says.

312
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:50,479
That's because as soon as I decide to leave the room, I'm already not only set to turn the doorknob, I'm already beginning to turn the doorknob.

313
00:25:50,479 --> 00:25:58,559
But I will put on reserve, I guess I haven't done it, the Good Ale, what's the other guy?

314
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:07,519
Ellen Goodale stuff about actually filling people's hands, getting ready, as soon as they get ready to leave, to begin to take the shape of the doorknob.

315
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,840
That's bottom line Merlot Fontee.

316
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:20,560
And in the same way, so that when you start to leave the room, when the bell rings and you aren't even out of your seat yet, you're already coping with the doorknob.

317
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:27,880
Well, it's something like that when you're looking at a house, and you're not just sitting there in a sort of path of observer sort of way.

318
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:30,839
You're either going around it or you want to go in it or something.

319
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:36,999
Your body is already coping not just with the facade, but with the whole house.

320
00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:50,439
And the idea then is, and behind me, well, how is it that this is that I would feel different if I think I haven't explained something clear enough about the house a minute?

321
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:57,239
I'm trying to explain how it would look different if I thought it was a facade than it looks if I think it's a house.

322
00:26:57,239 --> 00:27:13,160
Because if I think it's a facade, if I believe it's a facade, without rationally believing it, if I'm on a movie set and everything's a facade, when I'm looking at this one, which I hadn't seen before, I certainly won't be getting ready to go through the front door because things are showing up for me as facades.

323
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:24,279
However, if I'm on a normal street, whenever I start moving toward a house, it's because, presumably, if I'm not just a painter or staring at it, I'm getting ready to go through the door.

324
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:26,039
Now, what about behind me?

325
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:37,719
Well, behind me, I take it that I'm constantly ready and taking account of that I could turn around and write on the blackboard.

326
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:50,119
I would be, if there was a chasm behind me, it would my body would be set to do things different, like not walk back and fall into the chasm, and it wouldn't be set to turn around and write on the blackboard.

327
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,479
In that sense, I experienced the background behind me.

328
00:27:55,479 --> 00:27:57,880
I am already set to deal with it.

329
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:09,600
I want to really say if I could make it the case, I'm already dealing with it by dealing with there being something behind me besides a chasm, by being ready to back up.

330
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:19,359
I also think you all would look different to me if I thought that you were looking at a chasm behind me, but that I won't try to put into the equation.

331
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,759
Now, that's all very clear and important.

332
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:23,439
Well, let me finish this thought.

333
00:28:23,439 --> 00:28:26,719
And then you say to me, here's a puzzle for you.

334
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,920
It's puzzling me, so I'll give you all the puzzle about it.

335
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:34,959
How do you deal with the background behind the spot?

336
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,280
It doesn't seem to me as I'm set.

337
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,439
Maybe you were going to say this, but is anybody going to say this?

338
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,439
So you've got the same problem I have.

339
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:52,079
I don't know whether this, I mean, is my body in some way ready, set, already coping with what's under the spot, getting ready to lift up the spot and see what's behind it?

340
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,439
I don't think so.

341
00:28:53,920 --> 00:29:01,519
But yet that's supposed to be, I think, the same phenomenon of the concealed present, which you're already experiencing.

342
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:06,160
Do we have to say that it's a tiny set, just a tiny bit take up the spot?

343
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,800
And that seems always very squeamy.

344
00:29:09,439 --> 00:29:11,280
So you have an idea what we should say?

345
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:11,840
No.

346
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,079
I don't think you're very puzzled.

347
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,439
No.

348
00:29:15,439 --> 00:29:16,559
I don't know either.

349
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:29,279
And so is it wrong to think that it's because I'm set to go around the house and set to turn around and write on the board that I experience the layers present and the back side of the house is present?

350
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:36,239
Is there some other story looking in here that relates it to the spot more fundamentally than I see?

351
00:29:36,239 --> 00:29:37,520
Okay, big puzzle.

352
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:39,920
I hope to have an answer, but I haven't got one now.

353
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,360
You got something to say about it?

354
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:52,600
Um not about that puzzle particularly, but when you were saying what you did about um having a backboard, or as a blackboard behind you and still uh experiencing it.

355
00:29:52,600 --> 00:30:01,800
Does that mean that it's set to you sort of already you can mean that um it's sort of that's sort of your like that background is too weak.

356
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:02,840
That's too weak.

357
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:18,999
It means that uh this looks like even what's in front of me looks like a a room with a wall behind me and it isn't because I this is very important.

358
00:30:18,999 --> 00:30:23,239
This could turn out to be a big issue between me and Alva, I think.

359
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:30,199
But I mean I it's supposed to be it's not just possible that if I turn around I'll see the blackboard.

360
00:30:30,199 --> 00:30:34,039
But I'm already in some way coping with the blackboard.

361
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:35,479
That's why it's present.

362
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,720
You see, Merlot Plantee's going to make a big fuss.

363
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:39,320
You can keep this your eyes open.

364
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:47,319
That the intellectualist can only tell you about possible experiences.

365
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,479
If I do this, if I turn around, I'll see the blackboard.

366
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:56,680
Then that means that the blackboard is a possible experience.

367
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,520
And he wants to say, no, no, the blackboard is an actual experience.

368
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:03,800
I'm experiencing the blackboard now when I'm looking this way.

369
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:17,479
And and how to explain that has got all to do with this business of the body being already involved and already coping even with stuff that it hasn't got in its visual feel.

370
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:20,279
And that we shouldn't go on with that now.

371
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,879
But it's keep you keep your eyes open.

372
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,920
That's a big question that we need to a lot.

373
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:33,559
And when we get there, and it we get there only fully when we get to the chapter on the thing, because that's when you get this issue about the house, the laughing of the house.

374
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,039
But it's already brewing with the spot story.

375
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,199
Okay, now, where are we here?

376
00:31:40,479 --> 00:31:45,839
The first time you got to the the spot is right on the first page, I think, on four, or for us.

377
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,599
The first page for you.

378
00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:49,279
Well, the second page for us.

379
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:49,680
I don't know.

380
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,519
I think it's the first page in yours.

381
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,920
And then again, at the beginning of this chapter.

382
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,640
Let me keep, I'm going to make sure I get, okay, we're done.

383
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,839
26.

384
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,599
Okay, 29.

385
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,079
The last chapter for us.

386
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,479
He brings it back again.

387
00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:09,520
The phenomenon of the background continuing under the figure and being seen under the figure.

388
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:09,920
See that?

389
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,959
At the bottom of 29?

390
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:12,560
So he's done it three times.

391
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,759
It's very important to him.

392
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:20,880
You got it at the beginning of the first chapter, at the beginning of the second chapter, at the end of the second chapter.

393
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:29,039
So he says the body, that the background is seen under the figure when in fact it's covered by the figure.

394
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:44,479
A phenomenon which embraces the whole problem of the presence of the object as obscured by the empiricists, who only think that you could have association of the back as another determinate experience, and that's certainly not what he wants.

395
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:51,199
Or notice halfway down on 29, the strange mode of existence enjoyed by the object behind our back.

396
00:32:52,160 --> 00:33:00,239
And you see, he's objecting to the empiricist view that these other aspects of objects are no more than permanent possibilities of sensation.

397
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:11,599
We've got to abandon that, or we won't understand the way the ground is beneath the figure or the back blackboard present to me by and behind my back.

398
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:19,199
Now, look, I've only got five minutes, but I do want to tell you what to look for in the attention chapter, otherwise, I'll feel really, I haven't done my job.

399
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:23,240
I think I can summarize, well, no, it's a long story, but let me try.

400
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:26,359
Without reading anything from the book, tell you the story about attention.

401
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:29,959
Attention is a kind of double agent.

402
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:40,439
Attention, as we normally understand it, is like a spotlight which we show on things, which doesn't affect the things that it's shown.

403
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:44,119
Now, Marilyn Fontee thinks that's all wrong.

404
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:51,160
There are two ways that attention can function, and neither one of them is like that.

405
00:33:51,160 --> 00:34:00,599
One thing that attention enables you to do is take apart a whole into its elements by thinking them out and paying attention to them.

406
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:06,599
So that's how you can take apart the motor liar illusion if you get good at it, and introspectionists could do it.

407
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:14,920
Sort of don't pay attention to the end, just pay attention to the lines, break up the whole of this figure, and you'll see the lines are really the same length.

408
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:22,520
Or look at the illusions of a tube, which cuts out the whole context, and you'll see the moon is really the same size on the horizon.

409
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:36,199
And that kind of attention, which is analytic attention, which breaks down the whole and gives you the elements, and that kind of attention seems to support the impressionist story.

410
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,279
It seems to reveal the impressions.

411
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:39,640
Now comes the other part.

412
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,400
It's already there.

413
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:44,600
Because you can break things down into the elements.

414
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:56,280
And then if you think of attention as a searchlight, which only shines on things but doesn't change them, but only is you noticing them, then you get impressions.

415
00:34:56,279 --> 00:35:02,920
Because then you assume that the attention reveals the sensory core, which was there all along.

416
00:35:02,919 --> 00:35:16,640
Since attention shows you elements, and since it doesn't look like it's breaking things down into elements, it looks like you're just noticing what was already there, because you believe that attention is this neutral searchlight.

417
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:22,319
So the attention can, a certain view of attention, which isn't wrong, it can do that.

418
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:24,719
It can break things down into the elements.

419
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:34,960
But that combined with this view that the attention doesn't change anything is wrong, according to him, gets you the impressionist story.

420
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:45,280
Now, but what else could attention do besides this sort of negative job of breaking up holes and covering up the fact that it's broken up the holes?

421
00:35:45,279 --> 00:35:56,480
Well, it has this wonderful function of making new figures out of the background, where you bore into the background and bring out more and more of what is there.

422
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,719
That's the positive role of attention.

423
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,359
In both cases, attention changes things.

424
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,439
It's not a neutral spotlight.

425
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:13,520
In the first case, it changes things by getting rid of the context, by picking out the detail you're paying attention to, and thereby turning it into an element.

426
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:29,119
In the second one, it changes things, but in the opposite way, it exploits the figure ground structure, which you go and you sort of sink yourself into, and you can unwrap the background and bring it out as figure.

427
00:36:29,759 --> 00:36:33,919
I jumped, I mean, that's really the whole story about attention.

428
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:40,960
But in the second positive thing, he thinks that you're drawn to something.

429
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,840
We have this expression, it drew my attention.

430
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:50,640
So when you your attention is drawn to something, and then you unpack it.

431
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:58,120
And the most beautiful statement of that, I'll stop with this, is way back on page 78, where he tells the story.

432
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:01,400
You never know where anything is, and you have to rewrite the book.

433
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:06,919
But here's, I'll read this from 78, because this is the positive role of attention.

434
00:37:06,919 --> 00:37:15,239
To see an object is either to have it on the fringe of the visual field and be able to concentrate on it, or respond to this summons by actually concentrating on it.

435
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,480
I concentrate his attention.

436
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:24,279
When I do concentrate, that is, focus my attention, when I do concentrate my eyes on it, I become anchored in it.

437
00:37:24,279 --> 00:37:28,120
But this coming to the rest of the gaze is merely the modality of its movement.

438
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:37,560
I continue inside one object, the exploration which earlier hovered over them all, and in one moment I close up the landscape and open the object.

439
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:42,600
And then skipping to look to the middle, to look at the object is to plunge oneself into it.

440
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:51,160
And because objects form a system in which one cannot show itself without concealing others, okay, here I make a sense.

441
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:56,759
More precisely, the inner horizon of an object cannot become an object without the surrounding objects becoming a horizon.

442
00:37:56,759 --> 00:38:00,280
And so vision is an act with two facets and so forth.

443
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:07,399
So there's his nice example of the positive role of attention.

444
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:11,799
I think I'm just going to go on and assume we've got it begun attention.

445
00:38:11,799 --> 00:38:14,920
There's only one point in that chapter, but just this nice one.

446
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:20,120
And I'm going to start now rejudging for next time for sure in the phenomenal field.
