1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,679
So we're going to plunge back into this issue of the phenomenal field and the transcendental field.

2
00:00:05,999 --> 00:00:18,000
I thought I could just skip it and go on to the next section, but there's so much that's interesting and important in there that we have to do that before we get to the phantom limb, which is also so interesting and important.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,119
But we have two times as we have today and Thursday, so we certainly do the phantom limb part on Thursday.

4
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,160
I'm just thinking I'm going to get to it even starting on it today.

5
00:00:30,159 --> 00:00:49,280
But let's go back to the what is the, I'm still trying to get clear for myself and for you all, what is at stake in saying that this is a phenomenal field that we're studying, and then saying it's not a transcendental field, and then saying, well, yes, it is.

6
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,240
It's a transcendental field if you understand it the right way.

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,480
That's what's going on in that chapter.

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,199
It's high-level sort of methodology and not phenomena.

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:12,239
And it's tied in with the idealism issue again, which I hate to fall back into because I don't think it matters to what's important about Nerlo-Ponty that he's an idealist, which I think he is.

10
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,839
But this issue will come up again.

11
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,199
But let's start.

12
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:16,320
Thanks, Rick.

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:25,359
So let's start with the phenomenal field taken as a transcendental field and why that's wrong on page 62.

14
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,799
So where are we here?

15
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:34,079
We're in the middle of the page 62.

16
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:41,520
That's, I mean, I again, because this is one, two, three pages in, you see phenomenal field in italics.

17
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,199
So that's where we're starting.

18
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,839
The criticism of the constant of the hypothesis.

19
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:55,639
Remember, that's the Gestalta saying there's no important correlation between the stimulus hitting the sense organs and what we see.

20
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:08,039
The criticism of the constancy hypothesis, and more generally, the relation of the idea of the world, opened up a phenomenal field, which now has to be more accurately circumscribed.

21
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:15,239
Well, the phenomenal field, in effect, says, well, if the constancy hypothesis is wrong, then we just have to describe the way the world looks.

22
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,080
That's what the Gestaltas said.

23
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:25,719
There's no other way to understand what we want to understand, namely perception, except to describe the perceived world.

24
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:33,159
Describing the sensations and what's happening on the retina and so forth turns out to be almost completely irrelevant.

25
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:38,120
I mean, you can't just put anything on the retina and see some utterly wild other thing.

26
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,280
It sets up some boundary conditions, but it certainly doesn't correlate with the perceptual world.

27
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,119
That's old stuff.

28
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,640
So now we're going to go and look up the phenomenal field, and we have to describe it.

29
00:02:51,640 --> 00:03:04,359
And that suggests the recovery of a direct experience, which must be at least provisionally assigned its place in relation to scientific knowledge and to psychology and philosophical reflection.

30
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:16,359
So wow, these big methodological issues have to be faced if we're going to start just describing the phenomena the way the Gestaltas have taught us to do.

31
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:21,879
So then I think you can skip from 62 to 65.

32
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,640
Nothing important happens in there as far as I can see.

33
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:36,280
And it's really sort of the review of sort of modern philosophy as Descartes set it up.

34
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:44,239
And the fact that it's got only two at the bottom of 64, it's important that you'll come back.

35
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:50,960
That they've only got two kinds of being, the in-itself, which is pure determinate stuff.

36
00:03:51,280 --> 00:04:02,879
what Searle would call the brute given, and the for-itself, consciousness, or I suppose nowadays, mind and world.

37
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:10,879
That's the two kinds of being that they've got, and they've got to try to understand everything in terms of that.

38
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,520
And we're not going to talk about that.

39
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:26,960
He's talking about, I just want to tell you one, he's talking about the Husserl version of it at the top of 65, the constituting I, the constituting ego, and so forth.

40
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,000
By the way, constituting flops all over the place, as I said.

41
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,520
He uses the two for what he wants to talk about.

42
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,800
The constituting ego or constituting I, that's pure Husserl.

43
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:41,599
I'm going to say this again later, but I think it's important.

44
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:58,799
What he has against Husserlian phenomenology is the idea that you could describe the experience of a subject independent of whether there was any world that existed and that the subject was involved in or not.

45
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:02,960
That's the kind of transcendental that he's against.

46
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,559
That gets you transcendental ego and transcendental phenomenology, Husserl, Husserl.

47
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:24,439
And at the end of that first paragraph on 65, I just say this because it's not Merleau-Ponty, but Husserl who's saying it could be held that perception is an incipient science, science a methodological and complete perception.

48
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,439
No, I'm not even sure that Husserl says that.

49
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:28,120
Cognitivism says it.

50
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:52,599
Cognitivism says that starting with little children who are already little Newtons making up their hypotheses about reality and checking them out, as you will hear from Alison Bopnik or here or from Kerrig at Harvard, they're very good in discovering what an incipient science this is and how it goes back to pre-linguistic children.

51
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:55,080
That's not Merlot-Ponty's view.

52
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:14,919
That is, science, whatever it is, and he's going to come and tell you what he thinks it is, is not for him, well, perception is not for him, making a lot of inferences from data as to what's out there until you get a reliable representation of the world.

53
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:21,480
That's the cognitivist vision of it, and far for Merleau-Ponty.

54
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:35,159
Now, what he's trying to do, and it seems like a sort of, it is a kind of non-secretary, to oppose that view to what he's trying to do, because it's so different, there's no common language even to say it.

55
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:45,479
But his slogan is, at the bottom of 65, he wants a philosophy which explains the upsurge of reason in a world not of its making.

56
00:06:47,960 --> 00:07:00,919
That means he doesn't think there is any sort of rational structure to experience.

57
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:09,760
You have to start with experience in its ambiguous, what's his word?

58
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:36,159
Ambiguous is one of his words, with his indeterminate form, and find out how you get from there to the idea that there is some pre something outside experience that's determinate, that follows laws, and that could explain why experience takes the form it does.

59
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:45,600
For him, experience has to get to be more and more determinate and more and more, I guess he would say, logical.

60
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,919
I don't know what the word for it is, rational, I guess would be his word for it.

61
00:07:51,919 --> 00:08:02,480
You've got to explain it without assuming that there is any rational order out there that experience is trying to get right.

62
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:12,799
It's not just a hypotheses making about the world, which will finally get the right hypothesis about what the sun is and the trees are and everything else is.

63
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:28,159
And one of the ways he puts this is, whatever norms govern perception, and the Gestaltas find lots of norms, what counts as a better figure than this, what counts as equilibrium, what counts as similarity.

64
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:39,520
It isn't because they correspond to some determinate, describable order out there, so to speak, in the universe.

65
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,239
That's just the order that the that's just the way our experience organizes itself.

66
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,840
And there's no reason behind that.

67
00:08:47,839 --> 00:09:00,120
You get that from that, we, step by step, develop the idea that there is a determinate world with causal and other kinds of rational connections.

68
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:20,520
That's a quite, okay, so that's, and that's what he's going to talk about: why, how we get from this ambiguous, indeterminate perceptual experience which we have, to the idea of a determinate universe.

69
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:23,240
That's going, and I'm afraid we just have to go through it.

70
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,520
It's sort of fascinating.

71
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:43,480
I don't know why I thought we could omit it, because in the course of it, he goes through what's wrong with Plusero and the other kind of phenomenology, and he explains the crypto mechanism, how it works.

72
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,280
And we have to do that little by little.

73
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:51,720
One thing I want you to see on 68, though, no, no, that's not important.

74
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:56,120
I mentioned something on 68 last time, but I don't want to mention it again.

75
00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:01,480
So the wrong transcendental view starts on 69.

76
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,120
So remember, there is a phenomenal field.

77
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,960
We're all agreeing about that.

78
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,880
That's what the Disco show us.

79
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,559
We've got to describe experience.

80
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:20,280
There's nothing, there's no other way to find out what it is or why it is the way it is, but to describe it in its own internal norms and order.

81
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,480
That's fine.

82
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:27,640
And then there's a way to take that phenomenal field as a transcendental field, and that's a bad move.

83
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,920
So that starts to be the criticism on 169.

84
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:38,640
I can't help telling you, maybe just for the sake of the ghost of one of the people involved, that there's a story behind this.

85
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,599
I don't think I mentioned this.

86
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,280
Have I mentioned Aaron Gervich as a hidden figure in all this?

87
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:50,640
Okay, well, Gervich was a student of Husserl who studied Gestalt psychology too.

88
00:10:50,640 --> 00:11:00,319
and saw that there was an interesting relation between phenomenology and gestalt psychology, wrote his PhD thesis on that, and yet for I would.

89
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:04,240
And then the Nazis came and he had to flee to France.

90
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,799
And there, to make a little money, they had given some kind of job.

91
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:13,840
They made him a lecturer at some sort of very marginal institution.

92
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,960
And he lectured on the relation of phenomenology and Gestalt psychology.

93
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,800
And guess who was in the audience?

94
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:33,440
Merleau-Ponty, who had not yet written the phenomenology of perception and couldn't possibly have written the phenomenology of perception without Gervich, and who gives Gervich credit in about three footnotes.

95
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:43,840
And Gervich finally came to the United States and taught at Brandeis and finally got the sort of recognition he deserved by becoming a famous professor at the new school.

96
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:52,640
But in the meantime, Merleau-Ponty had sort of taken over Gervich's view, understood it, explained it, and refuted it.

97
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,959
It was a little late for him to come on to the scene.

98
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,320
And when his books were published, nobody paid any attention.

99
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:06,560
And in a certain way, rightly so, Merleau-Ponty had seen further.

100
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,159
Oh, I guess I can tell you another sad thing.

101
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:15,920
Merleau-Ponty saw further because he read Heidegger, and because he saw that Heidegger saw what was wrong with Husserl.

102
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:20,559
And Gervich, because Heidegger was a Nazi and had driven Mr.

103
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:20,880
and Mrs.

104
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:28,360
Gervich and all their friends out of Germany, except for having killed many of them, just couldn't study Heidegger.

105
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:34,120
So he never made the move from Husserl to Heidegger that Merleoponty made.

106
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,799
And that made him, I think, irrelevant.

107
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,960
Anyway, all that, believe it or not, is happening here on 69.

108
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:50,520
So the middle paragraph is where he starts to talk about the Gestalt people.

109
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:58,520
And he's criticizing the Husserl-Gervich view that he heard through Gervich.

110
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:00,280
So let me just read that.

111
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,320
Psychological reflection, once begun, then outruns itself through its own momentum.

112
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:15,000
That's a thesis of Husserl's, that if you start with psychology and think it through consistently, you end up with his kind of transcendental phenomenology.

113
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,360
And that's the view that Gervich defended too.

114
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:28,760
Having recognized the originality of phenomena in relation to the objective world, that's the phenomenal field, the critique of the constancy hypothesis.

115
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:45,079
It's through that the objective world is known to us, it, that is, psychology, is led to integrate with them every possible object and try to find out how that object is constituted through them, them meaning the Gestalt phenomena.

116
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:49,080
At the same time, the phenomenal field becomes a transcendental field.

117
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:56,520
Since it is now the universal focus of knowledge, consciousness definitely ceases to be a particular region of being.

118
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,159
That's a very dangerous move.

119
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:03,720
What that means is, and what and I, when Gervich was at Brandeis, so was I.

120
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,280
So I used to have dinner with Gervich every week.

121
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:26,560
And the big Gervich move, this is why this is so important to me, whenever I would defend Heidegger, which was very upsetting to him, he would then say, and I would say, talk about, I would talk about, say, the body in Merlot-Ponty as this sort of unreflective, unconscious power we have to organize things and everything.

122
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:32,159
And he would say, yes, but you've got to also think about how we are conscious of the body.

123
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:36,240
That's the last question that a phenomenologist has to ask.

124
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,680
That's what's happening here.

125
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:45,280
The Husserl-Gervich way of doing things is to finally always ask, and how are we conscious of that?

126
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:59,280
And we, as this kind of conscious, transcendental ego, must be organizing all of this, given our mental machinery and what's given to our consciousness.

127
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,520
And it's that which Merlot-Ponty is questioning.

128
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,520
I mean, you can only see it later.

129
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:10,880
We'll get to it more when we get more to the body issues.

130
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:20,000
But the really interesting question that used to come up between me and Gervich all the time was: to what extent are we conscious of our body and how?

131
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,680
And to what extent must we not be conscious of our body?

132
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,960
Must it be completely transparent when we're coping in flow?

133
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,600
And then why do you think there, and what do you think is the consciousness of that?

134
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,159
And so this is what the issue is.

135
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,600
So let's go on.

136
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:46,800
Consciousness becomesn't a particular region of being anymore, a collection of mental content and so forth and so forth, skipping down.

137
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:51,040
It goes out of being confined within psychological reflection.

138
00:15:51,319 --> 00:16:01,640
It can no longer be a question of describing the world of lived experience, which Niero Ponte likes, which it carries within itself like some opaque data.

139
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,079
It has to be constituted.

140
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:03,479
What?

141
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,520
That seems like I messed it up by leaving out something.

142
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,880
Let's try it again.

143
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:11,480
So we've got consciousness as a particular region.

144
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,199
I'll try that again.

145
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:14,520
A certain collection of mental contents.

146
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:24,919
It, consciousness, no longer resides or is no longer confined within the domain of forms, which the psychological reflection had recognized.

147
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:26,440
That's Gestalt.

148
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:30,520
But the forms, like all things, exist for it, consciousness.

149
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:38,520
I think it's consciousness, because back if you see consciousness defines so-and-so, then after the semicolon, it.

150
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,720
And it makes philosophical sense that way, I think.

151
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,360
Let's do it.

152
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,520
And if it doesn't, I'll retreat.

153
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,600
The reason why I did I didn't do the preview about it without the phenomenal field.

154
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,760
Yeah, well, let's see.

155
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,320
Where's that?

156
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:54,520
Let's go back to the semicolon.

157
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:57,000
I thought it was pretty clear.

158
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,439
That's why I'm surprised.

159
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,680
It's like all things exist for it.

160
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,119
Does anybody have a sense about that?

161
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,480
It looks like you've got a point.

162
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:13,799
Wait a minute, where now, since it, well, I still haven't found it.

163
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,080
There's the phenomenal field.

164
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:19,799
So since it is now the universal focus of knowledge, consciousness.

165
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:27,480
See, I think the consciousness, the it is one of these, it's a construction where the it refers ahead to consciousness, not back to the phenomenal field.

166
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:27,960
I think.

167
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,600
Let's try that.

168
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:33,400
Since it is now the universal focus of knowledge, consciousness definitely ceases to be.

169
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:36,000
Yeah, consciousness is the it, in that sense.

170
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,280
You see what I mean?

171
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,680
Okay, so I think it's there down there too.

172
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:47,599
Consciousness can no longer be a question of describing the world of living experience which it carries within itself, because I'm conscious of everything.

173
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,520
That's the Gurich idea.

174
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:51,839
Like some opaque data.

175
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:54,880
That is, it is inside of consciousness is everything.

176
00:17:54,879 --> 00:18:01,439
Consciousness doesn't need to, well, hold on.

177
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,919
Well, I don't know what that means, like an opaque data.

178
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,680
I thought I could explain that, but I can't.

179
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,359
It has to be constituted.

180
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:08,480
What is that now?

181
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:19,039
It can no longer be a question of describing the world of that it is just a you know a prepositional it or something.

182
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:24,720
It can no longer be a question of describing the world of living experience, which it carries within itself.

183
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,679
That it is consciousness, transcendental consciousness.

184
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:33,839
Like some opaque data, it, now what is it, has to be constituted.

185
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,320
I think that's the transcendental field.

186
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:45,119
I think that's us spelling out everything that's inside of consciousness.

187
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,679
It can't just be an opaque datum.

188
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,199
It's all going, which would mean something I wasn't conscious of.

189
00:18:51,200 --> 00:19:03,280
Everything in the con in everything is something that I experience, and therefore everything is something that I'm either directly or marginally conscious of, and phenomenology is going to spell that all out.

190
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,559
That's what this says.

191
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,599
Because you'll see in just a minute it's going to turn against that view.

192
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:09,520
But it sounds very plausible.

193
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,640
So let's see now.

194
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:12,399
Where are what world?

195
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:16,079
The process of making explicit, that's the constituting.

196
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:24,839
Making explicit all the stuff that we're conscious of, which had laid bare the lived-through world, which is prior to the objective one.

197
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:26,920
Well, that could be Gestalt's psychology, too.

198
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,559
Sorry.

199
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,799
That's probably Gestalt's eye cover.

200
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:34,439
That they laid bare the lived-through world prior to the objective one.

201
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:42,359
Now, that process, this is remember how psychology goes beyond itself, off the deep end, so to speak.

202
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:47,159
That process is put into operation upon the lived-through world itself.

203
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:53,559
That's the Gurbich kind of question, and how are you conscious of that as a phenomenon?

204
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:59,639
Whatever you say, whatever at dinner, no matter what it was repeating it or talking about it, it was always that question.

205
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:08,280
So now, it's upon the lived-through world itself, thus revealing prior to the phenomenal field, the transcendental field.

206
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:08,919
Voila.

207
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:21,240
The transcendental field is the constitutive making explicit of all the content of transcendental consciousness, and transcendental consciousness covers everything.

208
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,719
There's nothing that we can talk about that we aren't conscious of.

209
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,039
That's the move in here.

210
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:36,359
To say, well, we're going to talk about the way the body is invisible when we're in flow, the sort of sports view of the body.

211
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:44,280
Somehow, that leads these people, and I know it from experience, to say, well, we'll just have to figure out how we're consciousness of that.

212
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,680
Otherwise, how are you people going to talk about it?

213
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,520
Which just seems wrong, and that's what we're going to find out in a minute.

214
00:20:50,520 --> 00:21:01,319
Okay, the system, self-other-world, is in its turn taken as an object of analysis and is now a matter of awakening the thoughts that constitute other people.

215
00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:22,559
See, now we're way away from, well, Heidegger, those of you who know Heidegger and Merloponte, there's a kind of being with that you don't constitute in your own inner individual consciousness as if your consciousness preceded being with other consciousnesses, which is what Husserl thinks.

216
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:32,719
He wrote three big, fat volumes on inner subjectivity, trying to get from the world of inner ownness, as he would have called it, to the shared world.

217
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,839
And those, how many know Husserl?

218
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,119
Probably very few, but just curious.

219
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,879
Anybody know Husserl's stuff?

220
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,400
You had in some other?

221
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:41,280
How many know Sartre?

222
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:42,720
I'm wondering about that.

223
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,280
Neither.

224
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,559
Well, isn't that interesting?

225
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,719
Because Sartre is completely Husserian on this.

226
00:21:46,720 --> 00:22:06,559
He spends a lot of trouble in being in nothingness, showing how, starting with what is obviously given me with my own stream of experience, transcendental consciousness, I could get to believing that there were other minds, giving meaning to the very idea of other minds.

227
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,640
It isn't an empirical question.

228
00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:14,799
It's not like in Descartes, how do I know that there are other minds behind these coats or something like that?

229
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:20,879
It's how in the world I can even make sense of other minds, given everything I've got is always content of my mind.

230
00:22:20,879 --> 00:22:24,000
And they have interesting ideas about this.

231
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:25,599
Empathy.

232
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,880
Oh, never mind.

233
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:29,839
Because they're all obviously wrong anyway, as far as I can remember.

234
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,799
Been completely convinced by Heidegger that we are being with from the start.

235
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,280
The baby is being with before it's even born.

236
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,439
Apparently, the fetus gets in sync with the mother's voice and so forth.

237
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,039
Now, so let's see.

238
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,119
So, how do we constitute other people?

239
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:47,280
Myself as individual subject.

240
00:22:47,280 --> 00:23:01,000
See, myself as individual subject means sort of not transcendental ego, like Bert Dreyfus, somebody who has properties that you see and I see and disagree about what you think I am and what I think I am.

241
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:10,520
That's all constituted within this transcendental consciousness, which even isn't Burt Dreyfus yet, without me constituting you and having views of me.

242
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,599
And you can see why you could write three volumes about this fact on the subject.

243
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:17,480
That's a suspicious thing when you can do that.

244
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:24,839
Heidegger says that you could tell a good philosopher because he writes very short books and papers, and there's something to that, I think.

245
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:27,000
So, those are all tangled up in this.

246
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:28,120
Now, let's see.

247
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,159
So, where are we?

248
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:35,400
The subject thoughts and constitutes other people, myself, and the world is a whole of my perception.

249
00:23:35,399 --> 00:23:37,240
That's what we want to do in Husserl.

250
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,799
This new reduction would then recognize only one true subject, the thinking ego.

251
00:23:41,799 --> 00:24:01,159
This move from natura naturata to natura naturans, that means, and as he explains, from the constitutive to the constituting, they're constituting this wrong thing, would complete the phenotizing begun by psychology and would leave nothing implicit or tacitly accepted in my knowledge.

252
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:10,839
This is, by the way, a brilliant summary of Husserl's whole story about how you get from psychology necessarily to the transcendental reduction.

253
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:15,799
Would leave nothing implicit or tacitly accepted in my knowledge.

254
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:29,480
It would enable me to take complete possession of my experience, thus equating thinking and thought, such as the ordinary perception of a transcendental philosophy and also, to all appearances at least, the program of transcendental phenomenology.

255
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,200
Did I say something wrong?

256
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:35,920
The ordinary perspective.

257
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,120
Yeah, I misread.

258
00:24:35,639 --> 00:24:41,280
You can't, I mean, stop me when I just don't see what's on the page.

259
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:45,599
Okay, so now another aside.

260
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,119
This intellectual background is something that's so interesting and important.

261
00:24:51,119 --> 00:25:21,680
Merlot Conte, in the preface, which I didn't have you read because I think it's just all wrong, goes out of his way to claim that there is what he calls the existential phenomenology of the last period of Husserl's life in which he gave up transcendental phenomenology because he understood, after carefully looking at the phenomena, maybe reading, he did read Being and Time wise, that his approach was his transcendental subjectivity story was just wrong.

262
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,039
And I didn't ask you to read it because I think that's just wrong about Husserl.

263
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:32,399
He stayed a transcendental phenomenologist believing in transcendental subjectivity to the end.

264
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:33,600
And now what do you get?

265
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:41,599
A footnote, which is, he says that Husserl stayed transcendental phenomenology.

266
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:48,719
And then he says, it is set forth in those terms in most of Husserl's works, even in those published during his last period.

267
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,599
You look like, looks like the book is refuting the preface.

268
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:53,520
They're having an argument with each other.

269
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,639
Well, they are.

270
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,879
And this is a clever footnote.

271
00:25:56,879 --> 00:26:08,080
This is to say, I realize that everything Husserl published was transcendental phenomenology, but I, that is Marillo-Ponty, have read the unpublished manuscripts in Luven, which he had, before anybody else.

272
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:11,520
And if you'd read them, you'd see that he'd really given up transcendental phenomenology.

273
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:16,879
So you have to understand even those published during his last period under a line.

274
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:32,839
So this is, and it turns out, as far as I understand it, I've never seen in reading the unpublished manuscripts, as I did once upon a time, anything that holds up to this claim that Husserl ever gave up transcendental phenomenology, published or unpublished.

275
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:40,119
And in the latest, well, and now it's about five years old, publication of Husserl's doc, they're still publishing Husserl papers.

276
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:44,679
He wrote, I forget, was it 5,000 or 50,000?

277
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:51,319
I think it's more like 50,000 shorthand pages in his lifetime of just constantly writing about the phenomena.

278
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:55,480
Anyway, they published his own sort of obituary.

279
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:04,359
That is what he wrote just before he died just for some, I don't know what, magazine or encyclopedia that wanted to know what he was famous for.

280
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:09,480
And he claimed he was famous for discovering the transcendental reduction in transcendental objectivity.

281
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,399
That was his sort of claim to being a great philosopher.

282
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:17,639
So it's unlikely that in the unpublished manuscripts he'd given it up.

283
00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:19,240
That's just an aside.

284
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:19,639
Yeah.

285
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:21,559
Can you guys explain what transcendental means?

286
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:22,760
Okay.

287
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,520
What is transcendental psychology?

288
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,799
Where is transcendental phenomenology?

289
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:26,919
Where is the transcendental field?

290
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,319
Okay.

291
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,400
Good, good, good, good.

292
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,960
Transcendental always goes back to Kant.

293
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,480
Transcendental always means the condition of the possibility of experience.

294
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:42,760
Or really, I think in Kant anyway, the condition of the possibility of objective experience.

295
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:50,600
I think that won't be, you have to leave out the objective because Husserl's interested in inner experience too, and oh boy.

296
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:54,599
But that's what is what his transcendental means.

297
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:59,159
But now there are two different people trying to claim transcendental.

298
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:24,639
When Husserl says transcendental, he means not only do I look for the conditions of possibility of objective experience, but I look for them in the conscious experiences of a ego, and it's a transcendental ego because its experiences have in them the resources that make it possible for there to be experience of objects.

299
00:28:24,639 --> 00:28:45,280
And that and what Mero-Ponty is going to do by the end of this little section is take over transcendental because he's going to say, well, for me too, transcendental means the condition of the possibility of the experience of objects, but I'm not a transcendental Hussarian because I don't believe in the transcendental subject.

300
00:28:45,280 --> 00:29:05,760
I don't believe that I am a completely lucid or lucid lucidable, I don't know what the right word is, sort of explicable subject in whose experience all the possibilities of objective experience are contained.

301
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:26,319
Not every fact, like how many bothams are on those orange trees, but that all the general characteristics of all the kinds of objects that there are you could find out are by introspecting, or that's I don't like that word, by reflecting on the structure of transcendental consciousness and its content.

302
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:36,799
Now, so when Mero-Ponty says transcendental, he's going to say, yeah, I'm interested in the conditions of the possibility of all objectivity, including the universe.

303
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:43,119
That's why he turns out to be an idealist, because all of that comes back to the field of experience.

304
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:53,000
And it's a transcendental field of experience because it makes possible all experience of objects, galaxies, and electrons and everything, which in a certain sense is why.

305
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:55,639
It makes possible all experience of objects.

306
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:11,319
But it, and I don't know how to put this exactly, but I'm going to read this stuff in a minute, but it's never going to be clear about itself, and it couldn't possibly know itself except through the objects that it is engaged with.

307
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,360
What's the it?

308
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:13,240
Ah, it.

309
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:16,760
The well, that's a good question.

310
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:53,960
The transcendental philosopher like Merlot Conte can describe the perceptual world, and in that world will be an ego with experiences, but the idea that there is an ego with experiences which is the source of it all and completely clear to itself, that you could perform the reduction to talk like leave out the world, study the conscious experience of a thing separate from the world, the transcendental ego.

311
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,920
You can't do that.

312
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:56,680
Merlot-Conte.

313
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:07,399
The phenomenal field, which is me in the world and all you in the world together, is the condition of the possibility of all objective experiences.

314
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,839
Does that help any?

315
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:10,359
I mean, that's really what's the issue here.

316
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:11,559
Yes.

317
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,000
And my own question, which I think.

318
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:14,359
Well, let me try that.

319
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:16,920
The phenomenal field is what everybody agrees on.

320
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,240
That's what Viggestalta got to.

321
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,319
That's just the field of perceptual experience.

322
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:26,760
That's the perceptual world, I think it's safe to say.

323
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:32,760
Now, that comes out of transcendental field in two different ways.

324
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:52,959
One of them is that's uh the that gets understood as the conscious experience of a self-sufficient subject who is the source of all objectivity and all order.

325
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,480
That's Husserl.

326
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:07,839
The other one is the perceptual field, the the phenomenological field, gets understood as itself is what's self-sufficient.

327
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:16,000
And objects and subjects are sort of precipitate out of it for uh uh in it because of its structure.

328
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:35,199
When we we meaning empirical people like us do phenomenology and explain its structure, we do a kind of well now I think you wouldn't want to call it transcendental phenomenology because that's Husserl copyright data.

329
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:45,919
We do a kind of transcendental existential phenomenology because we and this is the crucial term I'm going to get there in a minute we have to describe the world from within it.

330
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,439
We can't bracket it.

331
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,119
We're not self-sufficient transcendental subjects.

332
00:32:51,119 --> 00:33:00,319
It's only that we will describe as far as we can and make explicit as we can the world that we're in.

333
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:05,760
But we'll never be able to describe it all, make it explicit all, even become conscious of it all.

334
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,880
That's the Merleau-Ponty idea.

335
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,080
Well, let's let's go.

336
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:12,159
Okay, good, good.

337
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,479
Okay.

338
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:13,439
Yeah.

339
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:21,039
His his argument is, and now we're going on page 70, we turn into straight Heidegger.

340
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:33,000
And his argument is, if you stick to the phenomena, I'll say it first, you discover that there's a kind of facticity, that you can never get behind your throwness.

341
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:53,319
These are Heidegger slogans, that consciousness can never get clear about itself, that I can never get clear about my history, that I'm always doing all this phenomenology from a perspective which I have inherited from my culture and my family and my history, a perspective I can never get clear about because I'm already in it.

342
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:58,359
You can get clear about those limits, yes, but you can't get how.

343
00:33:58,839 --> 00:33:59,399
Why not?

344
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:01,479
I mean, if I say, why not?

345
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,319
Because that's part of the phenomenon.

346
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:13,240
Because once you see, you see that you are, you're colored by your culture, your language, your history, how do you get clear about that?

347
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,240
By looking at how you look at things.

348
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,200
And doing what?

349
00:34:16,359 --> 00:34:30,839
Because to take a slogan which isn't going to solve anything, we do the, we, that's on page 74 of the punchline, by doing the phenomena of the phenomenon, we transform the phenomenal field into a transcendental one.

350
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:42,199
That the last line is, when we describe our experience, that's at the end of that section, the end of the phenomena, the phenomenal field section.

351
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:56,280
When we describe our experience, we discover that we can't find out our motives, that we can't get behind our thrownness, we can't find a perspective on everything outside of the history and the culture and the language.

352
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:06,639
And we we just do, I mean if we we do phenomenology, we come out of existential phenomenologists, if you if you describe what the the field of experience is really like.

353
00:35:06,799 --> 00:35:20,880
It's full of ambiguity, opacity, and and not of an accidental sort, because you're never going to be able to get out of your another slogan, sinitude, which it looks like Usero thinks he's doing.

354
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:25,119
Looks like Userl thinks he's describing this from nowhere.

355
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:31,600
He describes the history of the West, but he describes the history of the West from his own transcendental point of view.

356
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:37,200
It doesn't occur to him that that's part of the history of the West and a very bad part, a Cartesian part.

357
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,479
Okay, this is what's happening with 70.

358
00:35:40,799 --> 00:35:42,240
How many have had Heidegger now?

359
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,520
Lots of you, I hope.

360
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:48,720
Okay, because it's all of a sudden you will get a switch to Heidegger.

361
00:35:48,720 --> 00:36:00,560
Now, where we are, note 12, where he sort of bakes off is whether Usero ever gave up this kind of extreme transcendental phenomenology.

362
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:05,679
He switches to his view, which is pure Heidegger view.

363
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:16,880
Now the phenomenal field, as we have revealed it in this chapter, now we're on Merlot-Ponty, places a fundamental difficulty in the way of any attempt to make experience directly and totally explicit.

364
00:36:16,879 --> 00:36:19,120
That's what he thinks Usero is up to.

365
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:37,680
And one of the reasons is that this, I'm not sure why this is a reason, but he says it's one of the ways to see it is that the Gestaltists recognized that there was no way to make explicit why some Gestalts are better than others.

366
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,120
I'll read it because I think it's an important thing to him, but I don't really understand it as the interesting argument.

367
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,079
This isn't Heidegger.

368
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,559
That's why it's not quite right, I think.

369
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:51,280
It gets to be Heidegger on page 71, and then it gets to be really got its feet on the ground.

370
00:36:51,720 --> 00:37:00,919
But he says that although the Gestalt may be expressible in terms of some internal law, this law must not be considered as a model in which the phenomena of structure are built.

371
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,879
Their appearance is not the external unfolding of preexisting reasons.

372
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,799
He thinks that there's some pre-existing reason.

373
00:37:09,799 --> 00:37:11,160
I don't know why he thinks that.

374
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:12,359
No, I think he's for them.

375
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:13,399
Well, let's read it further.

376
00:37:14,439 --> 00:37:16,600
I think that, does he think they got it right?

377
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:22,520
It's not because the form produces a certain state of equilibrium, solving a problem of maximum coherence.

378
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,599
You're right, you're right.

379
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,999
He agrees with the Gestaltas and Gestaltists, but he's disagreeing with their metaphysics.

380
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,079
Yes, that's the way to put it.

381
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,200
Let's put it very clearly.

382
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:43,720
The Gestaltists, when they describe it, don't try to find in experience why this is considered a good form and this is considered equilibrium and that isn't.

383
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,240
They're just describing it.

384
00:37:45,479 --> 00:37:47,160
But that's good.

385
00:37:47,160 --> 00:38:10,839
Then they've got a metaphysics, a funny kind of metaphysics, which he thinks is just quite wrong, which is to say, but of course the reason why, let's say this figure looks balanced and this figure doesn't look balanced, is because the brain representation of these two figures, one of them is solving a problem of least energy better than the other.

386
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:12,519
Their model is sort of a soap bubble.

387
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:17,720
A soap bubble manages to get round by getting to the least energy.

388
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:25,960
If you get all your particles distributed, if you're a soap bubble, so that there's the least energy required, you turn out to be round.

389
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:38,080
And their model is that there is some kind of ephemero-Ponty sort of mythos, an economy of energy, which explains the Defeld norms.

390
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:41,439
And he thinks there is no economy of energy to explain it.

391
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:46,799
You can't just turn to the brain and to principles of least energy to explain it.

392
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:48,959
That's what he's talking about here.

393
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:59,839
And so he's saying it's not because the form produces a certain state of equilibrium, solves a problem of maximum coherence, and the Kantian sense makes the world possible, and so forth and so forth.

394
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:05,039
I don't think he's going to talk about the economic thing here, of the energy story.

395
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:11,120
It is the very appearance of the world and not the condition of its possibility, the birth of a norm and not realized according to a norm.

396
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,400
That's pointing toward the energy story.

397
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:19,759
It is the identity of the external and the internal and not the projection of the internal in the external.

398
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,560
I don't know why he puts it that way.

399
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,079
Anyway, we can talk more about that.

400
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,200
Does that surprise you?

401
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:25,439
I mean.

402
00:39:25,919 --> 00:39:26,319
No.

403
00:39:27,439 --> 00:39:38,160
Well, I mean, I feel that last part he's the saying that the GitHub psychologists are making is mistake that there's a phenomenal world and the objective one, and that kind of the phenomenal one is kind of built out.

404
00:39:38,399 --> 00:39:48,560
Yes, and grounded in the principles of De Spell psychology have to be found in the physical world in the least energy story, and they're looking for it in the brain.

405
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:53,760
And he thinks, and most people think that because they failed to find it, they were discredited.

406
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,760
Now, Merlot-Ponty thinks because they were looking for it, they should have been discredited.

407
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,000
I mean, it was the wrong question to be asking, he thinks.

408
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:02,640
Okay.

409
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,640
Now comes Heidegger, starting at the bottom 70.

410
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:14,160
If a universal constituting consciousness were possible, that's Husserl, the opacity of the fact would disappear.

411
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:40,520
Yet then we want reflection to maintain in the object, maintain, in the object on which it bears, its descriptive characteristics, this is sort of talking to Rick, and then if he's going to say now we've got sort of description on our side, its descriptive characteristics, and thoroughly to understand that object, we must not consider it a mere return to a universal reason and see it as anticipated in unreflective experience.

412
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:47,879
We must regard it as a creative operation which itself participates in the facticity of that experience.

413
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:53,239
Well, that is pretty opaque, but that's you, that's just, I'm glad I prepared you for it, I think.

414
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:59,240
To participate in the facticity of the experience means you can't stand outside and get it all clear.

415
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,999
You're in it, and you will not get it clear.

416
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:05,559
And then you can make a whole list of ways you can't get it clear.

417
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:10,520
Let me just say one more thing before you say things, because I want to finish this sentence, or the next sentence.

418
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:16,519
That is why phenomenology alone of all philosophies talks about a transcendental field.

419
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:18,280
Now, that's very important.

420
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,160
That's how to distinguish him from Husserl.

421
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:41,160
Husserl talks about a transcendental ego, which is this metaphysical consciousness in which everything is implicitly clarifiable, even though it's not all clear, because it's a universal, what Husserl says, an infinite task to do the job.

422
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:47,480
But it's nothing, nothing short, there's nothing there that couldn't be made clear and explicit.

423
00:41:47,479 --> 00:42:11,440
And the transcendental field talk, according to Merlot Ponty, means that you understand that it's the perceptual field that's going to be the condition of the possibility of experiencing objects in general, Kant, but it's not going to be something that is a self-contained sort of race cogitans for itself entity.

424
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:13,039
The transcendental field is this.

425
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,960
It's the perceptual world.

426
00:42:14,959 --> 00:42:18,799
That's the condition of the possibility of objects in general.

427
00:42:18,799 --> 00:42:24,319
And that's the big distinction, which I think I sort of made clear, I hope.

428
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:25,200
Go ahead.

429
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:29,599
The opaque datum from 67 comes back again in 71.

430
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:29,999
Yes.

431
00:42:29,999 --> 00:42:31,280
So I'm kind of curious.

432
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:37,120
So is the opaque datum just a quite version of the dead impression he talks about at the beginning?

433
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:40,799
In contrast to the living impression used by the romantics, which you heard?

434
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:41,759
I don't know.

435
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,280
Where does it come back?

436
00:42:43,439 --> 00:42:46,799
Well, Ross, we only talked about the opacity of the fact that disappears.

437
00:42:46,799 --> 00:42:49,200
The opacity of the fact that the opaque data?

438
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,240
No, I don't think so.

439
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,679
That's why I got puzzled.

440
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:59,839
I think I don't know the opaque datum is something what if the phenomenologists have to deal with and do.

441
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,680
Where's the first dimension of it?

442
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,839
I said I don't know what it means.

443
00:43:04,479 --> 00:43:05,519
Now we have to find the reason.

444
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,559
You got it?

445
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:10,559
But in 69.

446
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,839
Oh, button 69?

447
00:43:11,919 --> 00:43:12,959
It can no longer be a question.

448
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:14,639
Is no longer, I see.

449
00:43:14,879 --> 00:43:21,999
It can no longer be a question describing the world of living experience, which it carries within itself, like some opaque data.

450
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:43,919
No, it's, I don't know what it means, Joe, but that's meant to be a criticism of the transcendental ego of Husserl that he's got in it all this unexplicated experience which you could make explicit.

451
00:43:43,919 --> 00:43:48,799
That's why I don't know why, I mean, why would he call that an op opaque datum?

452
00:43:48,799 --> 00:43:50,479
It has to be constituted.

453
00:43:50,479 --> 00:43:52,520
That means made explicit.

454
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:54,839
The process of making explicit.

455
00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:56,999
Opaque, I wonder what it is in French.

456
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:58,439
I don't have time to look right now.

457
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,519
I mean, probably it says opaque.

458
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:09,399
But opaque there clearly means implicit, not yet fully clarified from the point of view of the Husserl people.

459
00:44:09,399 --> 00:44:14,119
Because everything could be made explicit and clarified if you had a lot of people working on it.

460
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,160
Husserl thought he was starting a big research program.

461
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:23,960
And if you had infinite time, because he thought it was going to take a huge amount to clarify everything.

462
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:30,039
So it's an opaque datum meaning something that needs to be clarified and can be clarified.

463
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:30,359
Yeah.

464
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:31,720
I understood something different, Green.

465
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:39,880
We talked about how the parts of the digital arouse expectations beyond them, and that's how they have a meaning.

466
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:45,639
I thought in that sense that the impressions were transparent, that they showed you something beyond them.

467
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:49,720
And I know the dead impression would be an opaque impression because it didn't show you anything beyond it.

468
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,119
Good.

469
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,240
I think that's another meaning.

470
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:56,999
I think back in the sensation chapter, where they were talking about impressions, they are opaque.

471
00:44:56,999 --> 00:44:58,519
They don't have intentionality.

472
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:01,240
They just sort of sit there and they're useless.

473
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:06,520
They're like all the criticism of the limit that they give in these days without any meaning.

474
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:09,640
How could you ever get any knowledge out of them?

475
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,760
That's one opaque.

476
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:22,440
I think this is an entirely different opaque because it's in the context of, just as we saw, sort of it goes right on to say that this opaque stuff is what should be made explicit.

477
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:28,040
And now, you tell me there's an opaque maybe on 71 that will class me right on this?

478
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,119
Because there'd be a third meaning of opaque.

479
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:34,680
Boy, talk about meanings of, you know, of constitution and so forth.

480
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,519
As I understand it, the sensations are opaque.

481
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,120
They don't have any meaning.

482
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:46,240
The content of transcendental consciousness in Husserl is opaque because it hasn't yet been clarified.

483
00:45:46,240 --> 00:46:00,240
It's opaque relative to how you would spell it out if you could describe everything inside of our experience as experienced without having to talk about the things, just the experience of the thing.

484
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,680
Now, what's the third opaque?

485
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,680
That's Heidegger facticity.

486
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:14,319
That's you can't get behind your throwiness, you don't know what your motives really are, you don't know what your history is making you see that you think is just out there and is really part of your perspective and blah, blah, blah.

487
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:20,079
That's opaque in the neat sense, the strong sentence, that you can't clarify it.

488
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:20,879
It's funny.

489
00:46:20,879 --> 00:46:21,999
I'm glad you brought it up.

490
00:46:21,999 --> 00:46:23,679
I think it's really kind of amusing.

491
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,280
Opaque to Husserl means not yet clarified.

492
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,720
And opaque to Heidegger means not clarifiable.

493
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,920
And neither one of them are talking about sensations.

494
00:46:33,919 --> 00:46:35,520
That's my guess.

495
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:37,359
So back to where we were.

496
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:41,280
We're almost done with this, but it's so condensed.

497
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,399
I've got to see where I am.

498
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:44,799
I left behind my notes long ago.

499
00:46:44,959 --> 00:46:45,759
Okay.

500
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,200
Oh, good.

501
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,920
Where are the transcendental feelings and vitalities?

502
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,680
I don't see it anymore.

503
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,160
It's gone.

504
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,119
Oh, yeah, got it on 71.

505
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,120
Okay, I'm catching up with where I am.

506
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,640
You just turn to Heidegger.

507
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,079
Yeah, that's what it says in my notes.

508
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:00,640
Okay.

509
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,359
The world indicates that reflection never holds.

510
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:16,319
Now this is Heidegger versus Husserl, on what you find out when you try to do your rigorous description of the phenomena.

511
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:23,560
And Heidegger's going to say, Husserl is bringing in all kinds of Cartesian baggage and assumption that keeps him from seeing what's really there.

512
00:47:23,879 --> 00:47:35,080
The world indicates that reflection, this word, the field, indicates that reflection never holds arrayed and objectified before its gaze the whole world with a plurality of monads.

513
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:49,879
Husserl took over from Heidegger the idea that each of us was a monad, a self-contained transcendental, well, he didn't write it and say transcendental, a self-contained consciousness, a self-contained stream of experience.

514
00:47:49,959 --> 00:47:53,799
That its view is never other than partial and of limited power.

515
00:47:53,799 --> 00:47:55,240
That's Heidegger.

516
00:47:55,399 --> 00:48:03,319
You can't have the world laid out in front of you, even as a limit of your hard work, even as an infinite task.

517
00:48:03,319 --> 00:48:05,480
It just isn't the way it's structured.

518
00:48:05,479 --> 00:48:12,600
It is also why phenomenology is phenomenology, that's also why phenomenology is phenomenology.

519
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:20,120
That is, a study of the advent of being to consciousness instead of presuming its possibility as given in advance.

520
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,720
Well, that's, you know what that is.

521
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:26,839
That's the same mysterious remark as he's going to study, where was that?

522
00:48:26,839 --> 00:48:34,280
The at the bottom of 65, the upsurge of reason in a world not of its making.

523
00:48:34,280 --> 00:49:01,319
I never fully understand that way of talking, but it's certainly got to do with the idea that order in our experience isn't something that you can presuppose is already there in an objective world, but the question is how our experience organizes itself so as to be rational and ordered.

524
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,679
That's something he thinks is perfectly fine to discuss.

525
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,839
That's what he's going to go on to discuss in the next few pages.

526
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:24,080
You can't say our experience or it gets, we discover that our experience is ordered because, one, there's already order in our transcendental ego, or that it's ordered because there's already a completely ordered universe out there.

527
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,560
There's nothing to get behind.

528
00:49:26,879 --> 00:49:33,680
But there's just the world of experience, and the world of experience does come into more and more order.

529
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:42,560
Each of us gets a more maximal grip on things, and I guess the whole culture probably gets a more maximal grip on things.

530
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:48,240
It's not as if we're ever going to converge on the whole grip on things.

531
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,119
That's an inevitable illusion.

532
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,639
I'm getting ahead of the story again.

533
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,399
That's the crypto mechanism.

534
00:49:54,640 --> 00:50:02,160
I think because you can get more and more order, you can finally get total order, which shows you the total order was there all along.

535
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,439
That's a series of mismoves.

536
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,719
I think I wrote five.

537
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,200
I'm going to get there today for sure.

538
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:19,919
How many missed moves you have to make to get the crypto mechanism mistake, and then one more missed move you get if you go on to idealism.

539
00:50:19,919 --> 00:50:22,240
All happening in these pages.

540
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,720
Okay, so there comes a lot more Heidegger.

541
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:32,560
Again, starting in the middle of the page, reflection can never make me stop seeing the sun 200 yards away on a misty day.

542
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,319
I don't know if Husserl said it would.

543
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:35,200
I don't think so.

544
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:44,240
He's getting carried away with the non non-determinate, non-rational order of the phenomenal world.

545
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,360
It's got illusions in it that you can't get rid of.

546
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:55,640
Maybe he thinks Husserl is the kind of intellectualist who thinks that if you could really get clear enough about the moon and then perception, the moon illusion would go away.

547
00:50:51,200 --> 00:51:00,200
He probably thinks that Husserl thinks that, but I don't know I doubt if he does.

548
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:10,440
But I think he thinks that Husserl doesn't appreciate the way the perceptual world has illusions and hallucinations just in it, and you're not going to get rid of them.

549
00:51:10,439 --> 00:51:25,960
Like, you're not going to get rid, you can't see the sun as you can't see the sunset as an earth rise, no matter how much you believe, no matter how much rationality there is, thanks to Copernicus and Galileo and all that, in seeing it as an earth rise.

550
00:51:25,959 --> 00:51:28,519
Our phenomenal world just doesn't work like that.

551
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:30,839
That's part of the facticity of it.

552
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:35,080
The body and the visual system just isn't rational.

553
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,000
That's maybe a clear way to put it.

554
00:51:36,999 --> 00:51:45,319
And he thinks that Husserl thinks that finally the body and the visual system will be shown to be rational.

555
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:49,399
I mean, he attributes the Husserl views even crazier than I attribute to Husserl.

556
00:51:49,959 --> 00:51:51,480
So I can't do much with that.

557
00:51:51,479 --> 00:51:52,599
He's not attributing anything.

558
00:51:53,399 --> 00:51:54,519
Oh, of course he is.

559
00:51:55,799 --> 00:51:56,439
Well, not directly.

560
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:00,679
I doubt it.

561
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:01,399
Because he's...

562
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,640
The critical is what he uses.

563
00:52:11,399 --> 00:52:15,399
And then he never mentions Kant.

564
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:21,400
Well, Kant's behind Husserl and Heidegger, and Meryl-Ponty's pretty close to Kant, too.

565
00:52:21,399 --> 00:52:31,319
I mean, I think it seems obvious that when he says that, well, no, I mean it you maybe it is Kant.

566
00:52:31,319 --> 00:52:32,039
I mean, I don't know.

567
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,480
I don't see how we can tell.

568
00:52:33,479 --> 00:52:43,360
He's been criticizing a certain view, namely the view that thinks that the phenomenal field licenses transcendental phenomenology.

569
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:45,200
And now he's saying, no, let me read it more.

570
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,680
Maybe we'll find out whether it's Husserl or Kant.

571
00:52:50,959 --> 00:53:05,520
See, Kant was, in this case, worse off than Husserl and easier to criticize, because Kant's whole project was to treat the perceptual world as if it was really the physical world.

572
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:13,200
So when Kant asks, how that is our experience of objects, he means causality, substances, and so forth.

573
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:18,720
He doesn't mean lecterns and certainly not moon illusions.

574
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,599
And Husserl was way ahead of that.

575
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:26,000
Husserl was actually trying to do a story about perceptual objects.

576
00:53:25,999 --> 00:53:31,439
By the way, this is the whole story that Holy Schultis's book, Mind and A Body and World.

577
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:45,760
He tries to show how Kant is giving you a story about the structure of the kind of objects that science deals with and treating perceptual objects as if they were like that, treating the world as if it was the universe.

578
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:52,720
And that if Kant had understood what Merle-Ponty understood, he would have rewritten the whole first critique a different way.

579
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,319
And then so just tries to write it.

580
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:55,039
So he's right.

581
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,079
He's writing the first critique the way Kant should have written it.

582
00:53:58,879 --> 00:54:01,360
This is probably in here.

583
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:05,999
But I don't think he's, well, let's go on.

584
00:54:05,999 --> 00:54:07,199
We'll see what's in here.

585
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:13,919
So reflection can never make me stop seeing the sun 200 yards away on a misty day.

586
00:54:13,919 --> 00:54:15,920
Now, I don't know what Kant thought about that.

587
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,000
I don't even know what Husserl thought about that.

588
00:54:17,999 --> 00:54:19,199
It's certainly true.

589
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,960
I can't, he can't do it.

590
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:36,200
Or seeing it rise and set, as I just said, or thinking with the cultural apparatus with which my, or can't keep me from thinking with the cultural apparatus with which my education, my previous efforts, my personal history has provided me.

591
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,839
Now, that could be a criticism of Kant.

592
00:54:38,839 --> 00:54:39,639
But you go on.

593
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:48,680
I never actually collect together or call up simultaneously all the primary thoughts which contribute to my perception or my present condition.

594
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:56,119
A critical philosophy attaches, and that could be Kant in the last analysis, no importance to this resistance offered by passivity.

595
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:56,999
Well, how can we tell?

596
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,359
Maybe it's going to get clearer.

597
00:54:58,359 --> 00:55:01,399
So so far, that's Husserl and Kant.

598
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:05,000
As if Kant's philosophy.

599
00:55:04,999 --> 00:55:09,720
Well, if you don't turn it into a general a critical philosophy, not the critical philosophy.

600
00:55:10,999 --> 00:55:15,240
Well, let's go into the older translation that's philosophy such as got critical.

601
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:15,959
Really?

602
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:16,439
Yeah.

603
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,720
That's what I have.

604
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:18,839
Interesting.

605
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:19,559
Oh, boy.

606
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:22,039
I can't resist that better.

607
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:27,319
I mean, is this a place where they improve the translation or where do they make it worse?

608
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,799
But I think it's a place where they improved it, so I don't have to.

609
00:55:32,919 --> 00:55:38,120
I never thought of an interpretation of a whole paragraph or perhaps chapter with hinge on it.

610
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,160
That's funny.

611
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:44,120
Check mind where page 71 in the print.

612
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:49,720
I don't know.

613
00:55:50,919 --> 00:55:58,600
See, I can't, I mean, I'm not ready to believe that this could possibly have switched to a discussion of Kant because all you've got on your mind is.

614
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,519
Of course, Kant is in the background.

615
00:56:00,519 --> 00:56:04,999
But I think a critical philosophy is exactly what he should say.

616
00:56:04,999 --> 00:56:11,119
That's a philosophy that tries to find the rational basis of all objective experience.

617
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:13,200
And Kant does.

618
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:16,959
But if you think we'll have to look, we're going to look at this in the French.

619
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,159
Oh, yes, it's a big deal for Husserl.

620
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:26,559
Passivity, passive synthesis, a whole book that thick on passive synthesis.

621
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,240
But that's his response to Kant.

622
00:56:32,959 --> 00:56:33,200
Right.

623
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:37,040
And Husserl thinks that synthesis isn't always done.

624
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,319
I mean, sometimes it is.

625
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:44,319
Everybody agrees by conscious application of categories and so forth.

626
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:53,439
But Husserl thinks, late Husserl, that there's some kind of synthesis that happens just by the gestalt organization of experience.

627
00:56:53,439 --> 00:57:00,400
I mean, he's really very, very close to getting the right idea there, except that he thinks it's synthesis.

628
00:57:00,399 --> 00:57:10,400
And then Nero-Ponty is going to criticize that later on, because synthesis presupposes that there's some kind of elements there that need to be put together.

629
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:18,160
Whereas if you really believe in passive whatever, you just say experience organizes itself this way.

630
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,079
Nobody synthesizes.

631
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,160
Synthesis is a Kantian term.

632
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:32,079
Passive synthesis is going to be Kantian, even if Kant never said it, because as soon as you say synthesis, you're in Husserl and not in Heidegger.

633
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:38,240
Now, you never, in all of being in time, I bet the word synthesis doesn't appear unless it maybe is an insult at some point.

634
00:57:38,959 --> 00:57:41,280
But it's all over the place in Husserl.

635
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:47,280
I mean, that's because that transcendental ego does all this, even if it does it classively, whatever that means.

636
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,319
Okay, let's go on.

637
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:49,199
It's fascinating.

638
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:55,240
A critical philosophy attaches in the last analysis no importance to the resistance offered by passivity.

639
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:59,240
Okay, now, certainly Kant doesn't.

640
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:05,319
In a certain way, Husserl does, because he thinks that he's got to explain it as passive synthesis.

641
00:58:05,319 --> 00:58:06,200
So let's go on.

642
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:10,839
As if it were necessary to become the transcendental subject in order to have the right to affirm it.

643
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:13,960
Good, tell me where.

644
00:58:13,959 --> 00:58:15,240
Not necessary.

645
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,280
Yeah, let me try that again.

646
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:24,760
A critical philosophy attaches in the last analysis no importance to this resistance offered by passivity, like the moon illusion.

647
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:31,640
As if it were not necessary to become the transcendental subject in order to have the right to affirm it.

648
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,440
What does that mean?

649
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,520
As if it were not necessary.

650
00:58:36,519 --> 00:58:39,160
Is that the same in the other translation?

651
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:45,799
As if it were not necessary to become a transcendental subject in order to have the right to affirm it.

652
00:58:45,799 --> 00:58:46,839
Ah.

653
00:58:47,160 --> 00:59:03,560
Well, I think hussarl, I don't know about Kant, but husseral things that you know you don't have to worry about passivity because it's just there.

654
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:10,119
Whereas from a husseral point of view, the activity, I can't say Kant because I don't know.

655
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:19,640
From a Husserl point of view, it would be necessary to become a transcendental subject in order to have the right to affirm it.

656
00:59:20,839 --> 00:59:26,039
No importance to this resistance offered by passivity, as if it were not necessary.

657
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:44,479
I think that means that Cholesterol thinks that once you're a transcendental subject, you can affirm the resistance of passivity while at the same time trying to take it over and explain it.

658
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:48,160
That sentence is absolutely incomprehensible.

659
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,680
I'll try once more and I'll go on.

660
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:58,319
A critical philosophy attaches in the last analysis no importance to this resistance offered by passivity, that's sure.

661
00:59:59,919 --> 01:00:13,680
That is, it doesn't care how we're integrated in the vital world, to talk another way, into the absorbable world, how our body does all sorts of stuff that our minds don't understand or would get in the way of.

662
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:20,799
That a critical philosophy doesn't pay any attention to that, which Merrill Ponte wants to pay lots of attention to.

663
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:26,880
As if it were not necessary to become the transcendental subject in order to have the right to affirm it.

664
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,759
I don't know what that means.

665
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,239
Yeah, I don't know if that is real.

666
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:44,959
But if you read the first part of the sentence as a sort of relation of a part for the previous thing, so he says, I never actually collect together and call up simultaneously all the clever thoughts.

667
01:00:44,959 --> 01:00:48,959
That is to say, I'm never conscious of synthesizing actively.

668
01:00:49,999 --> 01:00:50,639
That's right.

669
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,359
And then he says, here's the argument.

670
01:00:54,720 --> 01:01:08,639
And the critical philosophy makes fails to acknowledge this point and thus makes no room for the idea that the relevant synthesis, so it's an endorsement of Christians as against cuts.

671
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:09,440
Whoa.

672
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:14,079
And I think there's this very strange paradox in your interpretation.

673
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,519
I don't know what I'm doing.

674
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:20,399
Every time he says something nice about Husserl, you can says he doesn't know what he's talking about.

675
01:01:21,479 --> 01:01:23,639
Why did he ever say anything nice about Husserl?

676
01:01:23,959 --> 01:01:28,039
Well, that was the reason why I just started reading the purpose, because it's full of nice things about Husserl.

677
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,159
Because he was afraid to agree with the Nazis.

678
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,280
Yeah, I still think so.

679
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:38,600
And every time he says anything nice about Husserl, he contradicts it when the published, he says, admits it isn't in the published writings.

680
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:39,559
I mean, that's a surprise.

681
01:01:40,999 --> 01:01:42,600
Well, that's what I can't imagine.

682
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,600
I've got to go back and look at it again.

683
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:50,679
Not because I can't imagine him saying something nice about Husserl, although I don't know where he does, but I can't understand the sentences.

684
01:01:51,560 --> 01:02:02,359
So some lots of people on doing reflection don't understand or see but don't give any special weight to the passivity.

685
01:02:02,359 --> 01:02:04,920
That's the first thesis, right?

686
01:02:04,919 --> 01:02:06,760
Okay, we all agree about that.

687
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:16,280
Now, a critical philosophy, or Kant, or Husserl, we don't know what, attaches in the last analysis no importance to this resistance offered by passivity.

688
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:19,160
I think that's going to be true of Kant and Husserl.

689
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:25,480
As if it were not necessary to become the transcendental subject in order to have the right to affirm it.

690
01:02:25,479 --> 01:02:27,079
Ah, you're right, you're right.

691
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:31,159
He's saying, yep, it's a move beyond Kant.

692
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:34,680
He's not agreeing with it, but he's saying Husserl is one step beyond Kant.

693
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,239
I see.

694
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:39,399
Let's call that a critical, the critical philosophy, namely Kant.

695
01:02:39,399 --> 01:02:41,880
I bet the translation has messed it up.

696
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:48,359
So Kant attaches in the last analysis no importance to this passivity.

697
01:02:48,359 --> 01:02:49,560
That's right.

698
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:57,319
And now Husserl comes in and says, as if it were not necessary to become the transcendental subject in order to have the right to affirm it.

699
01:02:57,319 --> 01:03:05,160
That is, Husserl's become a transcendental subject, and he has the right to say there is passive synthesis.

700
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,200
And that's a step beyond Kant.

701
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,479
Let's try it that way.

702
01:03:08,479 --> 01:03:11,999
It tacitly assumes, consequently, I don't know what it is, yeah?

703
01:03:12,879 --> 01:03:18,799
The critical philosophy tacitly assumes, consequently, that the philosopher's thinking is not conditioned by any situation.

704
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:20,640
Only Kant, not Husserl.

705
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:21,519
What?

706
01:03:22,479 --> 01:03:23,839
Yeah, I can't understand that.

707
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:38,959
It seems to me he's just been saying all over the place that transcendental phenomenology makes the claim that it's not conditioned, that it's not to that it's that everything is constituting, and we are constituting our ego.

708
01:03:38,959 --> 01:03:40,160
This is the topic of 70.

709
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:41,440
This is Husserl.

710
01:03:41,439 --> 01:03:44,480
And everything else is constituted head.

711
01:03:44,479 --> 01:04:08,240
Now I think he must be saying, well, at least Husserl thinks, I see, I think he thinks, that Husserl thinks, that you've got to be a transcendental subject who sees that everything ought to be made explicit and actively organized by the transcendental ego to see that there's a problem of passivity and affirm it.

712
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:12,239
So, wow, Leigh Husserl sees passive synthesis.

713
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,080
That is interesting.

714
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:25,999
And you couldn't, according to Husserl, I think this says, see passive synthesis if you didn't think that there was all of it would have been better if it was all active synthesis, which Kant maybe thought.

715
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:32,799
Whereas Mero-Ponkey thinks that you don't need to be a transcendental ego to affirm passive synthesis.

716
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:33,919
It's all over the place.

717
01:04:33,919 --> 01:04:35,839
All you have to do is be open-minded.

718
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:38,319
You'll see the moon big on the horizon.

719
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:40,079
You'll see the sun rise and set.

720
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:43,760
You know, what a big, you're no big deal in affirming passive synthesis.

721
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:49,119
That's the structure of, sorry, the passivity is the structure of perceptual experience.

722
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:55,319
It organizes itself according to its own rules, doesn't care what we believe, doesn't care about what would be rational.

723
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:56,439
It just does it.

724
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:08,920
And now, to think that there's a problem of passivity and write a whole book about it, you have to be a transcendental ego who thinks that in the end it must all be explicable.

725
01:05:08,919 --> 01:05:12,519
And then you introduce the idea of passive synthesis.

726
01:05:12,519 --> 01:05:15,319
That's something Merrill-Conte will never say.

727
01:05:15,319 --> 01:05:17,480
And you worry about it.

728
01:05:17,479 --> 01:05:18,119
How about that?

729
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,079
Will that help?

730
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,359
Then I can understand the sentence, didn't you?

731
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:23,399
Yes, I'm not sure.

732
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:25,720
Pre-sciences further along.

733
01:05:25,879 --> 01:05:26,440
Okay.

734
01:05:26,999 --> 01:05:33,159
He's talking about, well, he writes, this is why maybe we need to read the NXL.

735
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,359
But he said it suspension.

736
01:05:34,359 --> 01:05:39,480
He says, this is why the problem of the knowledge of other people is never posed in Kantian philosophy.

737
01:05:39,479 --> 01:05:42,119
The transcendental ego is discovered.

738
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:49,159
That has evidence that discusses is just as much other people's as mine, right?

739
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:58,519
Analysis is from the South Nuclear Life side means that has nothing to do but to determine the general conditions which make possible a world for an ego.

740
01:05:58,519 --> 01:06:03,079
Myself as an egoist, but it never comes up against the question creates anything.

741
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:03,639
That's good.

742
01:06:03,799 --> 01:06:04,120
That's right.

743
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:07,639
I see.

744
01:06:07,959 --> 01:06:24,120
He's saying there, I think, from other things I've read, he's congratulating Husserl for having written all these big volumes on deducing inner subjectivity from transcendental subjectivity.

745
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:24,839
And why?

746
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:29,640
Because at least Husserl recognizes that there are a lot of transcendental egos.

747
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:30,439
And he says that.

748
01:06:30,919 --> 01:06:35,319
I mean, Husserl says it, and Merrill-Ponty says, and boy, that's a step in the right direction.

749
01:06:35,319 --> 01:06:38,959
Kant, you can't tell when you read Kant who this transcendental ego is.

750
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:41,759
It seems to be just something everybody participates in.

751
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:48,720
I don't know when you read Kant, how Dan Warren or Ann Ginsberg or whoever taught it deals with this.

752
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:56,399
But in Husserl, it's very clear that there's a plurality of transcendental egos, and each one of them is synthesizing.

753
01:06:56,399 --> 01:07:01,680
That's why he likes Leibniz's monadology over Kant on this point.

754
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:16,560
But I guess we all agree, but his Heideggerian vein, Merrill is like Ponty is going to say, of course, we don't have the problem of trying to show, deduce other egos.

755
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:18,959
And now I'll just give you a slogan.

756
01:07:18,959 --> 01:07:25,120
It turns out in the chapter on other minds that we have intercorporeality.

757
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:31,119
That it's just something constitutive of the way our body works, that we're in sync with other people's bodies.

758
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:43,200
So if you let me, I duck that, not because I figure out that that's dangerous, not because I think that if I were doing that gesture, I'd be angry, so you must be angry.

759
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,399
I just do it.

760
01:07:44,879 --> 01:07:48,960
And there we get to mirror neurons and stuff that people know about now.

761
01:07:48,959 --> 01:07:59,760
But it could be that the way our body works, we are able to be in sync with other binds in other bodies, other embodied minds.

762
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:06,079
And therefore, he thinks that Husserl's got one step ahead with Kant, but he's got it wrong.

763
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:06,959
That's cool.

764
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:07,759
I keep reading.

765
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:11,999
Yeah, I think Herzegovina should think about Husserl getting one step right to him.

766
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:19,880
You know, right after who he's thinking, you know, the thought it says, if, on the other hand, contemporary philosophy since it says it's the Husserl.

767
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:20,359
Yeah.

768
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:25,479
And if other people come up calling for it, it is because he's trying to achieve a more radical self-recovery.

769
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:32,599
And then he goes on to explain what I think is the process, and then he goes on to explain the Calinarian perspective.

770
01:08:32,679 --> 01:08:34,359
Does he do interceptivity there?

771
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:35,080
I don't remember.

772
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,120
And being with.

773
01:08:36,759 --> 01:08:37,719
Let me see.

774
01:08:37,719 --> 01:08:38,280
Let's go back.

775
01:08:39,479 --> 01:08:47,479
Yeah, the very first sentence, the very first page of the book, he says that these wonderful ideas of how he goes, other moves in Husserl.

776
01:08:47,479 --> 01:08:50,920
So that he should be blurry and how he's going to do it.

777
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:55,639
Well, I think if you could have your roots in Husserl and still User will be all wrong.

778
01:08:55,639 --> 01:08:59,000
I mean, after all, I mean, lots of these great ideas have their roots.

779
01:09:00,599 --> 01:09:03,240
Springs from the invitation, I'll be like Husserl.

780
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:09,879
Yes, I think, and that, and what that turns out to be, when you read further, let's look at the natural attitude.

781
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:13,479
And then he says, of course, User got the natural attitude utterly wrong.

782
01:09:13,479 --> 01:09:28,679
But the idea that we should not, you know, not do Kant in this case and look at everything from the point of view of sort of scientific consciousness, but look at it from the point of view of an everyday natural world, that's good.

783
01:09:28,759 --> 01:09:30,519
Userled made a big move.

784
01:09:30,519 --> 01:09:34,439
No philosophers had ever really said, let's pay attention to the natural attitude.

785
01:09:34,519 --> 01:09:43,399
User says it, and in three pages he's got it done with and performed the transcendental reduction and possible natural attitude just turns out to be a mistake.

786
01:09:43,719 --> 01:09:50,679
But I think being completely disingenuous and lying, he's doing everything he can to give User credit.

787
01:09:50,679 --> 01:09:53,639
Anyway, we obviously have a very different way of reading this.

788
01:09:53,639 --> 01:09:54,200
Yeah.

789
01:09:55,559 --> 01:09:59,960
You talked about the confusion about how there can be any transcendental egos.

790
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:04,120
I can't quote the whole of the conversation because I haven't read the critique, but I have read the groundwork.

791
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:06,319
When we talk about transcendental egos, are you still talking?

792
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:09,200
Are we talking about the same transcendental?

793
01:10:09,759 --> 01:10:11,759
Something rather as the new mental self.

794
01:10:11,759 --> 01:10:12,160
No.

795
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,799
We're not going to give how many back?

796
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:32,959
Well, I won't go along, but I mean, I take it that what we're supposed to think in Kant is that the transcendental ego, which is what unifies the objective world, isn't individuated, but the newlinal self, there are as many of them as there are people because each of them is morally responsible.

797
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:40,079
And it's certainly very important that every individual is going to go to heaven or hell and is morally responsible.

798
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:47,280
But the transcendental ego is more a kind of logical str structure, the structure of the categories.

799
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:54,319
And you don't even want to remember that the first edition was too psychological and it made it seem like it was something individuals might be doing.

800
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:59,120
So the second edition of the critique makes it all completely abstract.

801
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:13,280
So anyway, I'm not going to do Kant, but you could and do, and I think Kant does, not individuate the transcendental ego, still individuate the new self in the second critique.

802
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,519
No, nobody, we shouldn't be doing Kant.

803
01:11:15,599 --> 01:11:16,639
You've got our hands full.

804
01:11:16,639 --> 01:11:17,999
So let me go on.

805
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,599
Wow, this is getting much, much more interesting than I had imagined.

806
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:22,399
Where are we?

807
01:11:22,559 --> 01:11:23,679
I got to read every sentence.

808
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:28,079
Starting from the spectacle of the world, is this what we're supposed to be?

809
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:33,359
Which is that of a nature open to a plurality of thinking subjects.

810
01:11:33,359 --> 01:11:37,359
Okay, now that's what he thinks is the natural attitude.

811
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:39,359
That's what he thinks we should be studying.

812
01:11:39,359 --> 01:11:41,120
That's what he wants to start.

813
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:44,719
But now, then comes, Husserl, switches it, or I think.

814
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:55,000
It, Husserl, transcendental phenomenology, looks for the conditions which make possible this unique world presented to a number of empirical cells and finds it in the transcendental ego.

815
01:11:55,080 --> 01:12:01,799
That's pure Husserl, because Kant doesn't have a number of, well, maybe he has a number of empirical cells.

816
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:04,040
But I'm sure that must be Husserl.

817
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:06,599
Transcendental ego, I don't even know if that's Kant's terminology.

818
01:12:06,599 --> 01:12:07,160
Anyone know?

819
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,000
Does Kant talk about transcendental ego?

820
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,120
So that's got to be Husserl.

821
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:11,240
No, no, no, no, he does.

822
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:11,639
He does.

823
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:13,880
Oh, really?

824
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:14,439
Okay.

825
01:12:14,439 --> 01:12:18,919
In which they participate in that, because it is not a being, not a unity of value.

826
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:23,639
This is why the problem of the knowledge of other people is never posed in Kantian philosophy.

827
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:27,639
The transcendental ego, which it discusses, is just as much other people's as mine.

828
01:12:27,639 --> 01:12:28,519
Yeah, okay.

829
01:12:28,519 --> 01:12:42,519
So there are two different transcendental egos: the transcendental ego in Husserl, which is individuated, and the transcendental ego in Kant, which is as much other people's as mine, because it's the logical structure of objectivity.

830
01:12:42,519 --> 01:12:50,839
Analysis is from the start located outside me and has nothing to do but to determine the general conditions which make possible a world for an ego.

831
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:52,359
Now, is that Kant?

832
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:53,960
Never posed.

833
01:12:54,599 --> 01:13:01,479
The transcendental ego, which it discusses, that must be Husserl, is just as much other people.

834
01:13:01,639 --> 01:13:02,519
No, that's Kant.

835
01:13:02,519 --> 01:13:03,319
Clearly, Kant.

836
01:13:03,559 --> 01:13:05,399
Just as much other people's as mine.

837
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:13,639
Analysis from the start outside me has nothing to do but to determine, yeah, that's Kant, the general conditions that make possible a world in general.

838
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:19,160
The transcendental unity of that perception is the condition of the possibility of objective experience in general.

839
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:20,519
I taught my daughter to say that.

840
01:13:24,439 --> 01:13:26,679
That's even better in German.

841
01:13:26,679 --> 01:13:28,599
But now let's see where I was.

842
01:13:28,639 --> 01:13:31,799
And I think it's going to determine the general philosophy.

843
01:13:33,719 --> 01:13:34,120
Okay.

844
01:13:35,559 --> 01:13:45,359
Okay, determined the other hand, that could be that contemporary philosophy.

845
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:47,999
That's clearly, well, always got a big question.

846
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,519
That's either Husserl or Heidegger.

847
01:13:49,519 --> 01:13:50,080
We have to find out.

848
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:51,519
What?

849
01:13:53,599 --> 01:13:55,040
But they're both contemporary philosophy.

850
01:13:56,319 --> 01:13:57,200
Let's see what happens.

851
01:13:57,679 --> 01:13:57,920
Okay.

852
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,879
Takes this as its main theme.

853
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:05,519
And if other people become a problem for it, it's because it is trying to achieve a more radical self-discovery.

854
01:14:05,599 --> 01:14:06,880
Sounds like Husserl Kini.

855
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:15,759
Reflection cannot be thoroughgoing or being a complete, or bring a complete elucidation of its object if it does not arrive at awareness of itself as well as its results.

856
01:14:15,759 --> 01:14:34,240
We must not only adopt a reflective attitude in an impregnable hobbito, but furthermore reflect on this reflection, understand the natural situation which it is conscious of succeeding in which it is conscious of succeeding.

857
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:34,799
What is that?

858
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,479
Is that in the boy?

859
01:14:36,479 --> 01:14:39,679
When you read this carefully, you wonder how anybody can understand a word of it.

860
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:42,160
That's not English.

861
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:43,759
I don't know what that is.

862
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:45,359
Are they waiting out there?

863
01:14:45,359 --> 01:14:46,080
Not quite yet.

864
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:47,200
Okay, let's see.

865
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:49,679
And which is therefore part of its definition?

866
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:50,719
What?

867
01:14:52,639 --> 01:14:53,439
Yeah, is it?

868
01:14:53,439 --> 01:14:59,280
And which is therefore part of not merely practical philosophy, but realize the transformation which it brings within an hour.

869
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:03,120
Only on this condition of philosophy can become absolute knowledge.

870
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,559
It seems to be special.

871
01:15:06,559 --> 01:15:12,879
So there will be no assertion of the absolute unity, all the less doubtful for not having come into being.

872
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:16,479
The core of philosophy is no longer an autonomous transcendental subjectivity.

873
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:17,759
Wow, that's Husserl.

874
01:15:17,759 --> 01:15:18,960
And that's not Heidegger.

875
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:22,439
And you think he's already gotten rid of Husserl in the previous interview?

876
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:23,879
Big problem.

877
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,079
I'm not sure.

878
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:27,639
But I see that he's trying to differentiate.

879
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:28,280
Let's go this far.

880
01:15:28,439 --> 01:15:31,559
He's differentiating Heidegger and Husserl in contemporary philosophy.

881
01:15:31,559 --> 01:15:35,639
One of them has autonomous transcendental subjectivity.

882
01:15:35,639 --> 01:15:37,079
Guess who that is?

883
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:40,039
You better know by now that's Husserl.

884
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:45,799
And so the core of philosophy is no longer an autonomous transcendental subjectivity.

885
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:51,319
That means that he's already talking about Heidegger versus Husserl and he's on Heidegger's side.

886
01:15:51,319 --> 01:15:53,319
To be found everywhere and nowhere.

887
01:15:53,319 --> 01:16:00,599
It lies in the perpetual beginning of reflection, at the point where an individual life begins to reflect on itself.

888
01:16:00,599 --> 01:16:01,960
Reflection is truly reflection.

889
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:03,240
Now we're surely in Heidegger.

890
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:11,160
Only if it is not carried outside itself, only if it knows itself as reflection on an unreflected experience and pinned it with structure in our experience.

891
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:12,439
I think that's Heidegger.

892
01:16:12,439 --> 01:16:13,639
Now let's go on.

893
01:16:14,759 --> 01:16:16,039
One minute.

894
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:17,160
But I'm skipping a sentence.

895
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:25,079
But at the opposite extreme of philosophers, in the notion of a universal constituting consciousness, we encounter an exactly corresponding mistake.

896
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:27,639
I don't know who that is.

897
01:16:27,639 --> 01:16:28,920
Berrickson's mistake.

898
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:29,960
I guess Berrickson.

899
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,399
I don't know what that is.

900
01:16:31,399 --> 01:16:33,479
So let's not worry about Berrickson.

901
01:16:33,479 --> 01:16:36,039
I want to see if I can reach the end of this.

902
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:37,479
Okay, let's see.

903
01:16:37,719 --> 01:16:42,839
At the bottom of the page, we neither can become wholly conscious or make ourselves into a transcendental consciousness.

904
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:45,399
Well, Husserl thinks we can.

905
01:16:45,399 --> 01:16:52,039
And of course, Heidegger says we can't become wholly conscious and make ourselves into transcendental consciousness.

906
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:58,040
And then we get to the phenomenon of the phenomenon, which I think I've talked about.

907
01:16:58,359 --> 01:17:06,399
And the moral is supposed to be that when you do the phenomenon of the phenomena, this is my last sentence, you get to a kind of existentialist phenomenology.

908
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:11,679
The world is the phenomenal world that we must describe it from within, not as a transcendental ego.

909
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:18,479
And therefore we do, keep your eyes open for this, the conditions of existence, not the conditions of possibility.

910
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:24,319
And that's supposed to be the difference between Merlot-Ponty and Husserl.

911
01:17:24,319 --> 01:17:26,479
And then we finished less than I thought.

912
01:17:26,639 --> 01:17:29,839
Go and do the reading, because I'm going to get to the plant and limb next time.

913
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:30,479
Cool.
