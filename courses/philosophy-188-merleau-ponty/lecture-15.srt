1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:33,640
After sort of taking time out for two that are not involved in the perception of objects and how our body plays a crucial role in the perception of objects, we're back with the question of how the body perceives now it's intersensorially the objects with various qualities and that's going to be the subject for a long time, sense experience and then space, which is hard, but at least I have a feeling anyway they're very important things in there if we can figure them out.

2
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:43,880
And then I sort of probably my favorite chapter is a thing in the natural world where all this comes together in the story about what it is to be an object in the world.

3
00:00:43,881 --> 00:00:58,601
But anyway, here we are now on page 235 where he's giving us an overall view of the fact or the way the body and the world, as he puts it, the body and the world form a system.

4
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:04,200
Then you need to know, it's an interesting test to see how you're doing now.

5
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:09,001
I don't know whether to give you advanced warning or to see if you can get it.

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,680
Do you realize how many understood that at the bottom of 235, it suddenly becomes not Merle-Ponte?

7
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,601
You should know.

8
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:21,240
And he gives you a clue, which is unusual.

9
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,841
He says it will perhaps be objective that.

10
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:32,040
And then comes a whole intellectualist objection that goes on to the middle of 236.

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:52,040
That is the whole the idea that he's opposing is that in our experience there are separable elements that are of experience that correspond to various aspects of an object as we go around it, a cube in this case.

12
00:01:52,041 --> 00:02:05,440
We see it from various projections, and that those can somehow be isolated as elements and then put together in some kind of intellectualist synthesis.

13
00:02:05,761 --> 00:02:19,520
That's what he thinks is wrong, that you can't get behind the unity of the object, or you can't think that you find beneath the unity of the object some sort of elements that need to be synthesized or unified.

14
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,001
That's always constituted.

15
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,081
Those are always, almost always, bad things to say.

16
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,400
Sometimes he says in his own words, synthesize, and sometimes it says constitute.

17
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:32,880
At least that does confuse me.

18
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,560
And I'll point out a passage.

19
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,921
But generally, it's quite clear here that it's not Merhilopanti's view.

20
00:02:39,921 --> 00:02:41,841
It's the intellectualist view.

21
00:02:41,841 --> 00:02:51,280
And it's all about how we put together an object in conceiving of the whole cube, as he puts it.

22
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,800
When he's talking about conceiving, and then he talks about conceiving my body as a mobile object.

23
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:09,680
Well, that's surely all sort of as if I was doing all this standing outside, looking at the object as having these aspects and looking at my body as occupying some place in objective space.

24
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:24,801
Then my body moves around the object and reveals these various perspectives, and then my consciousness, my transcendental ego or whatever, puts together these perspectives as perspectives of one object.

25
00:03:25,281 --> 00:03:28,000
That's exactly not his view.

26
00:03:28,401 --> 00:03:35,680
There's when he looks 237, where he sort of tells you what his view is.

27
00:03:37,921 --> 00:03:41,081
And he uses the word constitute, so you can use it in general ways.

28
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:44,601
But look on 237, he said the top.

29
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,481
The cube with six equal sides is not only invisible, but inconceivable.

30
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:52,120
It is the cube as it would be for itself.

31
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,881
So he doesn't believe in that.

32
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,000
He's going to talk, now skipping down about 15 lines.

33
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,001
If there is for me a cube, that is, that's the cube that you can understand, you can, we're really dealing with, with six equal sides.

34
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,161
And if I can link up with the object, this is not because I constitute it from the inside.

35
00:04:11,161 --> 00:04:16,921
It is because I delve into the thickness of the world by perceptual experience.

36
00:04:16,921 --> 00:04:21,961
One of the hard things about this chapter, it seems to me, it's so metaphoric.

37
00:04:22,281 --> 00:04:25,081
Sometimes I can't really tell.

38
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,360
And if you can't tell, it's not your fault.

39
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,520
Well, I don't know whether, well, I'm assuming he understands it, so I can't say I can't tell whether he understands who he's talking about.

40
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:56,921
But I can tell that I'm not sure I understand what he's talking about because I find myself sort of having to go back and fall into his same metaphors and say it all in terms so close to his that I'm not sure I'm conveying anything to you that you either don't understand already or do understand already, but I'm trying.

41
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,761
But there's this alternative thing.

42
00:04:58,761 --> 00:05:03,721
If you go too far from his way of talking, you end up talking like an intellectualist.

43
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:07,401
You end up close to some version of Husserl.

44
00:05:07,401 --> 00:05:09,400
And we don't want that either.

45
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:11,721
So it's very hard to know.

46
00:05:11,721 --> 00:05:14,120
I used to think, well, we'll just get rid of all the metaphors.

47
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,360
We'll just tell what literally happens.

48
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,760
And I'm not sure there's any language for describing literally what happens.

49
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:26,081
So you get things like, you delve into the thickness of the world by perceptual experience.

50
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:46,800
Let's try at least to say something, not in those exact words, which is something like, it's always, in my other jargon, engaged existence, blending into a world that you're always trying to get a grip on and you're always already involved in.

51
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,841
Sometimes it's called being in the world.

52
00:05:49,841 --> 00:06:04,961
Just delving into the thickness of the world by perceptual experience is trying to describe your perceptual experience from the engaged attitude as a body moving around in a world, trying to get a maximum grip on things.

53
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,240
I presume this is just another way of saying that.

54
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,721
And that it's it if you have one worries about it, at least have I captured it?

55
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:15,521
I don't know.

56
00:06:15,521 --> 00:06:18,560
But let's keep, I keep trying and you can decide.

57
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,640
I'm 237.

58
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:22,961
You hear what he says about it now.

59
00:06:23,521 --> 00:06:24,481
Two-thirds down.

60
00:06:24,481 --> 00:06:30,161
The cube is already there in front of me and reveals itself through the perspectives.

61
00:06:30,161 --> 00:06:31,601
Well, we've got to get used to that.

62
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:32,961
That's the crucial thing.

63
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:34,240
Which comes first?

64
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,961
The whole object or the perspectives.

65
00:06:36,961 --> 00:07:02,161
And if you think that the perspectives come first, then you're in a kind of intellectualist view, a view that I think Husserl held at some point anyway, where you have to have something external to the perspectives, which he called the noema, which is an intellectualist structure, like a conceptual thing, which holds together in your experience the experience of the perspectives.

66
00:07:02,161 --> 00:07:05,121
And that's certainly what he doesn't want to say.

67
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:09,680
He wants to say that you always see the whole object from a perspective.

68
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:25,161
And that what comes first and doesn't need to be synthesized, and he's going to go on and on and try to tell you why, roughly to give you the feel for it, because your body schema takes it in and gives it to you as an object from a perspective.

69
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:32,761
And that's not a job your mind can do, or your transcendental ego can do, or your concepts could do.

70
00:07:32,761 --> 00:07:40,441
It is a job that gets done by the body schema, that there is this object from a perspective.

71
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:47,721
But the body schema doesn't do it as a kind of copy of the mind, just unconsciously synthesizing the perspective.

72
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,440
So how the body schema does it, we're not told.

73
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,401
And that's fine.

74
00:07:51,401 --> 00:07:53,241
I think that's the right thing to do.

75
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:58,121
Because if he told you how the body schema did it, we'd be in intellectualism.

76
00:07:58,921 --> 00:08:05,721
And when I hear it, I always think, and I think I said this again in the last lecture or the one before.

77
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:11,560
I mean, you could think like this, your perceptual system does it, and you don't have the slightest idea how that works.

78
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:17,001
Nobody in the world has the slightest idea how these billions of neurons do it.

79
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:22,361
But it gets done in you and through your body.

80
00:08:22,361 --> 00:08:28,521
And by the time your mind comes along and your consciousness and you're aware of it, it's already done.

81
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:42,761
And it's a big, it's the big intellectual mistake, intellectualist mistake, to think that you've got to somehow break it down into its elements and explain in some minutes way how they got unified.

82
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,201
They just are unified when you experience them.

83
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,361
And you can't get behind that.

84
00:08:50,361 --> 00:09:04,961
You can say, I'm just repeating myself, the body schema did it, but the body schema can't be a rule or a hierarchy of rules, as Husserl calls the Nalima, for doing it, or you're in Kahn, or Husserl, or C.I.

85
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,281
Lewis, or some intellectualist view.

86
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:09,680
That's the view he wants to resist.

87
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,041
That much is clear to me.

88
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:18,880
So let's read this passage and many others, which I'll come across in due course, but we're still two-thirds down on June 37th.

89
00:09:18,881 --> 00:09:22,001
The tube is already there in front of me and reveals it.

90
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,881
Well, I better go ahead.

91
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:28,481
I do not construct the idea of the geometrized projection which accounts to these perspectives.

92
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,641
That would be the rule that relates them all as perspectives of an object.

93
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:36,560
The tube is already there in front of me and reveals itself through them.

94
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,481
That was all I was speech was about.

95
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:45,681
He's always experiencing the object from a perspective, but you're not experiencing an isolated thing called a perspective.

96
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,881
This is holism.

97
00:09:46,881 --> 00:09:50,161
You know, top-down holism is another name for it.

98
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:52,720
Or he's going to call it a...

99
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,561
That's enough for a minute.

100
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:03,121
I do not need to take an objective view of my own movement or take it into account in order to constitute the true form of the object behind its appearing.

101
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:15,441
That is, I don't have to worry about where I am in objective space relative to the objective space in order to make sense of why the perspectives are unfolding in the order they're unfolding in.

102
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:28,001
That's, again, to stand outside and look at yourself as if you were a computer trying to compute the object by the data that's coming in, and that's not how we do it.

103
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:30,241
I do not need to tell where I'm so important.

104
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,321
The account is already taken.

105
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,601
See, already the new appearance has composed itself with the lived-through movement.

106
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:39,921
So you don't know where you are in objective space.

107
00:10:40,361 --> 00:11:13,481
You know that you and the object have some whole linkage, and as and you understand your movement through the way the perspectives are changing, and you understand how the perspectives are changing through your experience of your movement, and those are two sides of the same system, that they and they all are aspects of something more fundamental, how your whole body is already in touch with this whole object.

108
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,721
That's how he pictures it.

109
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,161
Let me see where it's going.

110
00:11:17,161 --> 00:11:30,841
The thing and the world are given to me along with the parts of my body, not by any natural geometry, but in a living connection comparable or identical without existing between the parts of my body itself.

111
00:11:31,161 --> 00:11:39,080
Well, again, I don't know, I don't find that very helpful, but I think I was just trying to, but I was trying to paraphrase it.

112
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,161
A living connection, I mean, these are the metaphors you've got to make sense of.

113
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,320
Why is there a living connection?

114
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:54,761
Well, it's a connection that only happens because you're living it, experiencing it, moving around in the world, doing it.

115
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,241
That's the point, I think.

116
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,440
And why is it like the connection of the parts of the body?

117
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:09,001
Well, because remember, the whole body is acquired to and gives the significance to and the position to the elements.

118
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:22,680
Now it's the whole body and the object within this kind of dance, which that whole thing gives the meaning and the significance to and relates whatever aspects.

119
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,640
I need two words.

120
00:12:23,641 --> 00:12:24,641
You need two words.

121
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:27,041
I'm going to use them consistently from now on.

122
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:27,841
I think this way.

123
00:12:29,761 --> 00:12:34,640
You need a name for a perspective thought of apart from the object.

124
00:12:34,641 --> 00:12:36,881
It needs to be synthesized into an object.

125
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,361
Let's call that features of the object.

126
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,641
The features are prior to the whole.

127
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:51,361
You also need a name for the perspective view of the object, which is the object seen from a perspective.

128
00:12:51,361 --> 00:13:01,281
Let's call that an aspect of the object, where aspect means situational already embedded in and defined by its place in the whole.

129
00:13:02,161 --> 00:13:07,921
And he's really saying you never synthesize features, you directly experience aspects.

130
00:13:08,241 --> 00:13:09,680
Anyone want to say anything about this?

131
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,121
Olivia and Alva, of course, wanted to say something.

132
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,960
I want to point out an expression that we are going to see in the introduction, in the beginning of the fourth chapter, the scenario film.

133
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,161
He talks about the constitution without ideal modeling.

134
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,361
Oh, good.

135
00:13:23,361 --> 00:13:23,761
Okay.

136
00:13:24,161 --> 00:13:26,641
This cuts both ways, but it's important to say.

137
00:13:27,121 --> 00:13:32,001
It says that what's the pen.

138
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,121
Where it exists?

139
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,401
About one page after the beginning of the fourth chapter.

140
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:38,161
What's the fourth chapter?

141
00:13:38,161 --> 00:13:39,361
In the introduction.

142
00:13:44,401 --> 00:13:46,081
Okay, Alva will tell us what it is.

143
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,200
In our dictionary, okay.

144
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,361
Okay.

145
00:13:58,001 --> 00:13:59,360
I love these phrases.

146
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,361
I'm surprised I haven't ever read this.

147
00:14:01,361 --> 00:14:03,761
I don't think I ever have out loud.

148
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,081
Look at all.

149
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:10,601
I mean, this is all this metaphor, but it's nice to read it again, just what I've been saying.

150
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,401
And then we'll get to the place where, well, I suppose I'll just fall on the place that Olivia is mentioning.

151
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,601
Well, no, she talks about it's lower, but I'll get there.

152
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,521
But I like to read at the top here.

153
00:14:20,761 --> 00:14:23,001
Sense experience, third line.

154
00:14:23,001 --> 00:14:25,881
Invest the quality with vital value.

155
00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:30,760
I mean, there's all vital, whenever you see vital, you could equally well say existential.

156
00:14:30,761 --> 00:14:33,401
It always is meaningful coping.

157
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:41,961
Grasping it first in its meaning for us, for that heavy mass which is our body, whence it comes about that it always involves a reference to the body.

158
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,880
Let's skip some stuff here.

159
00:14:43,881 --> 00:14:45,320
Two-thirds one sixty-one?

160
00:14:45,641 --> 00:14:46,841
What, the other book?

161
00:14:47,001 --> 00:14:47,961
Two-thirds of the one.

162
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,401
Yeah, on 61.

163
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:51,240
I see where it is, but we should tell everybody.

164
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,601
But I haven't got there yet.

165
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,560
Sense, I'm now about one-third down on 61.

166
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,601
Sense experience is that vital communication.

167
00:14:58,601 --> 00:15:00,521
He's only got one metaphor, really.

168
00:15:00,521 --> 00:15:02,121
It's alive, it's vital.

169
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:20,840
So that vital communication with the world, which makes it present as a familiar setting of our life, it is to that, it is to it that the perceived object and the perceiving subject owe their thickness.

170
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:24,600
That's another metaphor that he gets into every once in a while.

171
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,440
Think of the thickness when you just think of the house as you already see the house from the front.

172
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,121
The back is already present.

173
00:15:32,121 --> 00:15:33,561
It's not a facade.

174
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,881
That would be a perspective.

175
00:15:37,321 --> 00:15:39,321
It's an object from a perspective.

176
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:41,000
That's the thickness.

177
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,480
And then, really wonderful, it is the intentional tissue, which the effort to know will try to take apart.

178
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,161
That's a weird phrase.

179
00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:51,080
Intentional tissue.

180
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:53,520
I once had an idea of how to say that.

181
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:59,841
Well, we'll get to what he means by intentional.

182
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:03,040
And tissue, I think, is like body tissue.

183
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:09,921
I mean, and it's the way the body and the world are so intertwined, finally, that you can't take them apart.

184
00:16:09,921 --> 00:16:14,000
I guess now that I think of it, intentional tissue becomes flat, right?

185
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:22,560
Yeah, intentional tissue is what he'll later call the flesh, and it's just the way that there's one big whole of which the body and the and the object are aspects.

186
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:26,641
Now we're skipping down to what Olivier calls attention to.

187
00:16:26,881 --> 00:16:30,401
I'm going to start a paragraph in a sentence so I know where I'm going.

188
00:16:30,401 --> 00:16:33,600
Whereas these notions, what is these notions?

189
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,881
Association and passivity are volcano notions now, right?

190
00:16:38,881 --> 00:16:40,480
But you're talking about it.

191
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:56,720
Whereas these notions take on their full meaning of sense experience as distinguished from quality, then association and affinity in a Kantian sense is the central phenomenon of the perceptual life since it is the constitution without any ideal model of a significant grouping.

192
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,081
I don't know what to think.

193
00:17:02,161 --> 00:17:13,680
If God would attribute this to Kant of all people who are the arch intellectuals, is he saying that Kant doesn't have rules for synthesizing everything?

194
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:24,720
Well, this is a the re this is the rereading the rereading of of Kant by himself, but what he what he talks about here is the the the meaning he himself was against the Constitution.

195
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,081
So this is a good expression expression, I think, because he he remains talking that constitution throughout the world.

196
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,680
It means this without ideal model, without proof.

197
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,960
But sometimes Kant okay, oh, so hmm, I'll have to go back and look.

198
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:42,200
So keep your eye open, is all I can say.

199
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:55,960
And my guess is right now, there are two senses of constitution, because often the word constitution turns up in these passages which are clearly not narrow upon people and seem to have to do with this intellectualist move.

200
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,280
You're saying constitution never means intellectual.

201
00:17:58,601 --> 00:17:59,161
I'm not.

202
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,921
I'm saying that the meaning here of what he proposes is it's an algorithm at the end.

203
00:18:03,161 --> 00:18:04,761
You mean to use it both ways.

204
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:17,081
But when we see constitution in the text, are we supposed to always think that it's a way of putting something together in terms of its holistic significance and not in terms of any intellectualist move?

205
00:18:17,081 --> 00:18:21,720
Or can it sometimes be intellectualist constitution, depending on the context you're reading?

206
00:18:21,881 --> 00:18:22,921
Sometimes it means here.

207
00:18:23,321 --> 00:18:24,520
Oh, the real meaning of theory.

208
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,520
Any ideal model is the real one.

209
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,561
So it won't be called, okay, let's check this.

210
00:18:31,561 --> 00:18:41,320
It won't be called Constitution where I was just reading about it, because that was sort of insulting this by saying that an ideal model, right, on page 236.

211
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:43,321
Is that going to be called Constitution?

212
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:48,440
Let's hope not, because I'd be happy if he stuck to any meaning.

213
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,040
Well, 236 is this whole paragraph which is not narrow upon T.

214
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:59,800
It will be objective, starting at the bottom of R235, at the beginning of that section.

215
00:18:59,801 --> 00:19:02,840
The theory of the body is already the theory of perception.

216
00:19:03,161 --> 00:19:06,841
I don't think I usually mark it when I see Constitution, that he uses it.

217
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:08,841
Maybe I agree with this point.

218
00:19:08,841 --> 00:19:09,321
Yeah, yeah.

219
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,480
Because what I'm saying is relevant to the interpretation of the...

220
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,480
Okay, yeah?

221
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,041
Yeah.

222
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,921
Okay.

223
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:30,240
So, as I understand you, Professor Verdez, what you're doing is portraying sort of a strongly intellectualist view, against what the same is the correct mode of my view, and strongly intellectual view as it.

224
00:19:30,641 --> 00:19:34,881
But what we do is we're effectively aspect.

225
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:36,401
No, I mean, not to say aspects.

226
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:36,800
Right.

227
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,280
That is to say, isolable bottom line.

228
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:55,121
He doesn't mean it's fun remote, but that feature in this sense doesn't mean the radius or the post-he means what's presented from the perspective.

229
00:19:55,121 --> 00:19:55,440
What?

230
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,720
No, wait, no, no, no, no, you can't say that.

231
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,081
I don't disconnect everybody.

232
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,840
Victor would be the perspective, the way I'm announcing the term.

233
00:20:03,921 --> 00:20:06,401
Aspect would be the object of presenting.

234
00:20:07,361 --> 00:20:17,281
So when you, the intellectual speech with the ones who reject, says here, can you see perspective and synthesize a sense of the whole out of that through some intellectual aspect?

235
00:20:17,921 --> 00:20:23,360
And the good view says, no, we're always immediately aware of the whole.

236
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:30,000
But we always experience the whole from a point of view, from the perspective, and possibly use the word aspect in the good way.

237
00:20:31,361 --> 00:20:39,840
And to make sense of that as a reading, you're forced to say that this large passage that you know is read exactly where it is not a point of view.

238
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:41,600
But if it were a passage, there's no passing.

239
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,360
Let me just say there's a third reading.

240
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:56,240
The third reading, which says that simultaneously, as we're, one can simultaneously, as a phronological matter, be aware of the whole by being aware of its aspect.

241
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:59,881
Yes, one experiences the whole in the aspect, through the aspect.

242
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:07,601
When it's over through the aspect, there's always a chance that it's true, both that one's experiencing the whole and that one's experiencing the aspect.

243
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:11,800
And there's no source of knowledge that you're saying that you're experiencing the aspect.

244
00:21:12,121 --> 00:21:23,320
And if you're in perfect one of the finding that you have a plan to be able to change that first perfectly, because this is going to shoot down at you.

245
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,401
We're going to lose everybody.

246
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,721
This is a dangerous thing.

247
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,600
But it's interesting, so let's just keep everybody.

248
00:21:34,921 --> 00:21:42,921
Oh, I wanted to tell you, when you get lost, because there have been complaints, and rightly so, that we get into these discussions and lose you.

249
00:21:42,921 --> 00:21:57,480
That's a legitimate complaint up to now, but it's not going to be legitimate from now on because it's your job to raise your hand and say, I don't know what you're talking about, you've lost us, and then I will either drop it and we'll talk about it later, or I'll explain it.

250
00:21:57,881 --> 00:21:59,000
That's what you're saying now?

251
00:21:59,321 --> 00:21:59,720
Okay.

252
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,520
This one, a good point.

253
00:22:03,081 --> 00:22:05,720
But I think this is so important that we won't lose you.

254
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,240
We'll just take you with us.

255
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:16,041
I mean, a lot depends on whether Merlot Conte is defending an intellect.

256
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:19,320
He's never defending an intellectualist view.

257
00:22:19,321 --> 00:22:36,360
So the question is: is he presenting, as I think he is, an intellectualist view in this first paragraph, starting where it will perhaps be objective at the bottom of 135 and the top of 136 for us, which he is rejecting.

258
00:22:36,361 --> 00:22:55,601
And that would be a view that what is ultimately, given, or given at all, but to talk to what Alva's interested in, that what's given at all is a perspective of an object, sorry, a perspective, which put together with other perspectives, adds up to an object.

259
00:22:56,161 --> 00:23:03,200
And I'm saying he doesn't think that's the case at all, because the whole determines the parts.

260
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:10,000
And we're back to this thing, it's worth repeating endlessly because you have to keep saying we're back to the house and the girl on Telegraph Avenue.

261
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:29,280
There is a view that isolates the perspective as a feature says that there's something about the back of the girl or the front of the house that stays the same, whether you consider them in isolation or whether you consider them in looking at the object.

262
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,401
And I could be sure that Merlot-Ponty rejects that view.

263
00:23:34,401 --> 00:23:47,520
He wants to say there is nothing in your experience that stays the same when you look at the back of a man walking down with a beard and a mustache walking down Telegraph Avenue and you look at the back of a beautiful girl walking down Telegraph Avenue.

264
00:23:48,081 --> 00:23:51,440
Even if it's the same person, nothing stays the same.

265
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,480
If anything did stay the same, it would be a feature.

266
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,320
It would be a perspective.

267
00:23:56,321 --> 00:23:57,600
It would be an element.

268
00:23:57,601 --> 00:24:00,240
And it would need to be put together with other elements.

269
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:11,200
I want to say, he says that since you always see the whole object from a perspective, you'll have to see the back of a man with a mustache or the back of a girl.

270
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,000
You can't see the back of a human object, according to him.

271
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:24,560
You've got to see it with all of its other sides already implicated in the side you're seeing.

272
00:24:24,561 --> 00:24:26,080
And that's what he's talking about.

273
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:33,760
And when he seems not to say that, I think I can always relearn to read the book, as I'm hoping to it.

274
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:43,000
I think whenever he ever says anything else, it's always the intellectuals you're getting at into and telling you that's not the way to think about it.

275
00:24:43,641 --> 00:24:58,600
And the issue is really whether it's top-down and all the elements get whatever significance and perceptual character they get from their place in the whole, or whether the elements can be considered as separate from their place in the whole.

276
00:24:58,601 --> 00:25:02,521
And I think he's very clear that they can't.

277
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,721
Are you unlocking?

278
00:25:05,801 --> 00:25:07,161
If you're unlocked, we can go on.

279
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:10,440
Yeah, very good point, because I don't want to pass the front quote.

280
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,401
It's very important.

281
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,720
I'll just make one textual point.

282
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:24,680
I think that one, when he says it may perhaps the objective, that he makes the objection about one sentence, and then he picks up his red and his own voice after that one sentence.

283
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,200
Well, and I haven't seen any textual argument with that smile.

284
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,240
Okay, well, is he?

285
00:25:29,401 --> 00:25:32,600
I think he says subsequently in his three-point development.

286
00:25:33,641 --> 00:25:37,161
I mean, I'm going to look back at it because I think this is an important paragraph.

287
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:39,401
Go back at the Conference 236.

288
00:25:39,401 --> 00:25:43,801
As I move around, I see the front face living to a square.

289
00:25:47,081 --> 00:25:48,200
That's ambiguous.

290
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:56,520
And I don't mean it could mean I see the front face as something which you could isolate from the whole object, doing this little trip as you walk around.

291
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:03,321
Or you could see I see the object from the front, changing its aspect as I walk around.

292
00:26:03,321 --> 00:26:04,200
So we don't know yet.

293
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,120
Well, the other side comes with the only one.

294
00:26:06,121 --> 00:26:11,881
But the success is taking R4 means merely the opportunity of conceiving the whole cube.

295
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,721
You think conceiving the cube is relevant to his story?

296
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:21,320
The cube is directly given from the bottom, from the ground up in his story.

297
00:26:21,321 --> 00:26:23,200
You think he conceives the cube?

298
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:25,600
Which side do you think?

299
00:26:25,601 --> 00:26:27,521
Is this paragraph Merilloponte or not?

300
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,641
Not Merillo-Ponty?

301
00:26:28,801 --> 00:26:35,601
Because on 237 at the last page, he talks about...

302
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:43,440
It precisely says in the intellectual sense of constitution that you do not constitute the cube from the inside.

303
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,960
So this is constitution with an idea, mother, which is the one he rejects.

304
00:26:47,121 --> 00:26:48,161
That's what I think.

305
00:26:48,161 --> 00:26:50,000
Okay, but that's what I think, Galva.

306
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:59,281
The thing is, you have an anticipation of what the whole cube might be when you begin grasping it from one part, when you're embedded in the world and everything.

307
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:06,881
But this anticipation doesn't give a meaning to the object that would be geometrical.

308
00:27:06,881 --> 00:27:10,800
So the cube with six equal phases constituted it from the inside.

309
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:11,841
This is not the way you anticipate.

310
00:27:12,321 --> 00:27:18,401
He says that's not only invisible but inconceivable because I don't really get it here.

311
00:27:18,401 --> 00:27:20,960
If anybody can help me, let's do it while we're here.

312
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,280
Because you have to experience the cube by getting inside it.

313
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,641
This is the menu 237 where constitute comes up again.

314
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,841
If there is for me a cube, this is clearly his view.

315
00:27:31,841 --> 00:27:35,041
Me is Merilloponte, a cube with six equal sides.

316
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,121
And if I link up with the object, this is not because I constitute it.

317
00:27:39,121 --> 00:27:41,121
Ah, that's on my side for constitute.

318
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:53,840
Constitute it from the inside, but because I delved into the thickness of the world by perceptual experience, meaning that I just immediately have a house that's thick or whatever.

319
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:54,240
Right?

320
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,200
And so we're back to that again.

321
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,720
I don't, I mean, it's so obvious that.

322
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,360
Okay, let's read the next sentence.

323
00:28:01,841 --> 00:28:11,721
The cube with six equal sides is the limiting idea whereby I express the material presence of the cube which is there before my eyes under my hands in its perceptual self-evidence.

324
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:13,161
What?

325
00:28:13,161 --> 00:28:13,800
It comes after.

326
00:28:09,841 --> 00:28:14,601
It comes after.

327
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,720
First you get the lived cube and then you can of course abstract the idea of the cube and he isn't against that.

328
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:26,440
Expressing it is not, you don't have to express it in order to dress the cube.

329
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:26,921
That's right.

330
00:28:26,921 --> 00:28:27,960
You don't even have to have it.

331
00:28:29,161 --> 00:28:30,361
The cube comes prior.

332
00:28:30,361 --> 00:28:33,881
The lived experience of the cube is definitely supposed to be prior.

333
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:34,440
Yeah.

334
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,161
Don't get lost if you're if you're getting lost, that's fact.

335
00:28:37,401 --> 00:28:39,000
But this is the crucial issue.

336
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:51,721
We're trying to get our debt clear about the difference between Merilloponte's position and this very attractive, very similar intellectual exposition, which comes to us from Kant and to me from C.I.

337
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,921
Lewis, who was my teacher, and the time I had a break out of it.

338
00:28:54,921 --> 00:29:08,760
And it's so close to what Merlopony was saying and so seductive because it says you need a mental equivalent for every kind of meaningful organization of the elements that you've got.

339
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:17,480
It's worth spending a lot of time deciding, one, which you want to believe, and secondly, which Merlot-Ponty believes.

340
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:17,960
Yeah.

341
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,320
I actually want to change the subject.

342
00:29:19,641 --> 00:29:19,800
Really?

343
00:29:20,361 --> 00:29:21,480
Okay, I'm going to change the subject.

344
00:29:21,641 --> 00:29:22,921
Okay, at the bottom of that paragraph.

345
00:29:23,801 --> 00:29:25,161
No, no, naturally not.

346
00:29:26,601 --> 00:29:31,240
We've got a whole, unless you use up the whole hour on this, I got lots of persuading passages.

347
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,280
We have to go on, yeah.

348
00:29:32,281 --> 00:29:43,800
Okay, at the bottom of that paragraph in 237, he says that the object, the thing in the world is given along with the parts of my body in a living connection comparable or identical to that existing between the parts of my body.

349
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,161
That's the schema.

350
00:29:45,161 --> 00:29:45,401
Yes.

351
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,161
And so but that suggests that the object is part of my body's schema.

352
00:29:49,561 --> 00:29:49,720
Yes.

353
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:51,161
That's how we're supposed to read that.

354
00:29:51,161 --> 00:29:53,080
Yes, in the end, he says amazing things.

355
00:29:53,081 --> 00:29:54,040
I can't open to them.

356
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,200
Olivia probably can't.

357
00:29:54,841 --> 00:30:00,720
My body and the object are really just two sides of the face of two aspects of one thing.

358
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,960
And the body schema and the sentence.

359
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,080
Where is it then?

360
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,161
External perception and the perception of what's sort of conjunction.

361
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,040
Because they are two facets of one and the same act, right?

362
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,641
So it is the body schema.

363
00:30:14,641 --> 00:30:17,121
But you can't, here's another way to put it.

364
00:30:17,121 --> 00:30:18,721
And this is indeed very important.

365
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:27,360
You can't have any access to the body schema as something you could entertain in your mind, as something you could describe as rules.

366
00:30:27,361 --> 00:30:27,760
What?

367
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,881
That's separated from the word.

368
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:33,281
It's separated from the actual living of it in contact with the object.

369
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,801
He's very clear about that.

370
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,641
You have no access to it.

371
00:30:36,641 --> 00:30:40,401
It's not sensory, motor contingency spelled out as a rule.

372
00:30:40,401 --> 00:30:41,520
There is no such rule.

373
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,560
You have no access to such rules because there aren't any.

374
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:50,720
All you have is your perceptual system is doing something we don't understand.

375
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,561
And so there's no middle story about some mental operations that we understand that don't happen to be there.

376
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,801
The brain is doing something, the visual system is doing something.

377
00:31:01,121 --> 00:31:03,121
You're busy doing something.

378
00:31:03,121 --> 00:31:11,520
And that is the only access you have to the body schema is that a unified object is showing up for you.

379
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,641
As soon as you think there's some third thing you can describe called the body schema, you've lost Mero-Ponte.

380
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,080
Now, maybe he's wrong, but that's his ways to say that.

381
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:30,881
I just want to point out how they external perception and perception of one going by, and he doesn't think that's important here and then make that perception and by appropriate action.

382
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,881
But that's kind of the opinion of this whole thing.

383
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:41,320
Yes, I mean, I like that slogan, which I came across in something you wrote, but I but I then I continued to be unhappy with that slogan.

384
00:31:41,321 --> 00:31:43,000
Let me see if I can remember why.

385
00:31:39,841 --> 00:31:45,561
Well, it was because of reading this, he didn't say it.

386
00:31:46,440 --> 00:32:02,680
It struck me as odd that he never talked about my feeling of where my body was as if he thinks that I, in effect, know where my body is because I know where the object is, and vice versa.

387
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,921
I don't need that propriocept to find out.

388
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,561
You said it in terms of it.

389
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:16,520
Yeah, okay, but proprioception is so I wrote a note to myself, but I thought I was.

390
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,720
Okay, well, that's good.

391
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,520
Okay, if that's proprioception, that's fine.

392
00:32:20,681 --> 00:32:29,000
Now, I do believe there is proprioception because we've got these, there are these brain-injured cases, which if anybody's interested, you should study, of people who don't have it.

393
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,801
Yeah, a sense of your own body, a feeling for your own body.

394
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:40,440
It's knowing where your body is just by being it in the activity of using it.

395
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,440
That's the wrong way you're saying it, knowing.

396
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,080
Okay, again.

397
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:43,880
Okay, yes.

398
00:32:43,881 --> 00:32:50,841
Sensing where your body is, right, in the activity of using it, and only through the activity of using it.

399
00:32:50,841 --> 00:32:51,881
That's me.

400
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,521
That experience is called proprioception.

401
00:32:54,520 --> 00:33:04,921
And people who lack it can't even get across a room without having to see where the floor is and where their feet are and where their feet are, and that their feet are in contact with the floor.

402
00:33:05,241 --> 00:33:07,000
They have a real rough life.

403
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,880
They are in their intellectuals.

404
00:33:09,881 --> 00:33:13,720
They have to keep performing mental syntheses in order to do all this.

405
00:33:13,721 --> 00:33:16,041
And of course, that's a disaster.

406
00:33:16,281 --> 00:33:16,520
Yeah.

407
00:33:17,401 --> 00:33:22,841
I understand that Berlin Plante is saying that the object is part of the body scheme, but I'm not happy about that because I don't know what it means.

408
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,680
Well, I thought I could tell you what it meant.

409
00:33:24,881 --> 00:33:34,240
You can't describe the body schema except insofar as you can say that it's what's unifying the object when you're dealing with it.

410
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:41,921
It's a claim that, unlike Christero's no email, which Klisero thought he could describe as a hierarchy of rules for putting stuff together.

411
00:33:41,921 --> 00:33:51,921
Now, I think, unlike Alva's story, that there are sensory, motor contingencies, and they are the sort of thing that we understand in the sense that we could write them out, and C.I.

412
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:02,241
Lewis's view that there are meanings in mind, which says if I do this, I will see the table from this way, and if I do that, I will see the table from that way, and can write all that out.

413
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:04,960
That's the concept in the concept table.

414
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:17,361
Merrill-Planty wants to deny that and say there's nothing you can say about the body schema except that if you get involved in coping, you will be presented with a thick, unified object.

415
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,480
That's fine.

416
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,921
What you said, I'm more concerned about the issue of idealism that we were talking about.

417
00:34:22,241 --> 00:34:22,800
Okay, of course.

418
00:34:22,801 --> 00:34:27,200
Well, that's because there's one thing to say unifying the object, but I'm not sure that's the right thing to say.

419
00:34:27,361 --> 00:34:30,161
It constitutes our experience of the object.

420
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:30,720
What does?

421
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,480
The body schema.

422
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:39,440
So that the object is what it is for us because of the body schema, which is lack of background.

423
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:45,440
So it's part of the body's our experience of the object is wrapped up in the body schema in that sense.

424
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,321
But there's a way of agreeing this that think unification is very idealistic.

425
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,921
In what sense?

426
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,401
Why?

427
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,361
Where?

428
00:34:53,361 --> 00:34:53,520
What?

429
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,761
The notion of unification is something that's not a good idea.

430
00:34:56,761 --> 00:35:00,480
He's not in the unification business is that you said.

431
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,120
I said?

432
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,761
Yeah.

433
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,600
No, unification.

434
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,041
Did I say that?

435
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,000
When did I say that?

436
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,720
That's bad.

437
00:35:06,721 --> 00:35:09,400
I mean, I want to say it's already unified.

438
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,200
Unification is idealist.

439
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:19,641
It suggests that there are elements and that you've got some kind of mental activity that unifies those elements.

440
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,600
I thought I said, or I meant to say, did I, will you, will you.

441
00:35:24,841 --> 00:35:31,960
But anyway, I want to say, well, the perceptual system that you are, that's in your body somehow does it.

442
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:41,720
I mean, you have to put together from the incoming, what does Gibson call it?

443
00:35:41,721 --> 00:35:45,800
The sensory array or sensory stimulus array.

444
00:35:45,801 --> 00:35:53,960
You have to put together, moving around in a lot of energy inputs on the physical level, the experience of the world.

445
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,841
Somehow that gets done.

446
00:35:56,841 --> 00:36:02,440
But it doesn't get done by unifying elements.

447
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,480
We don't have any.

448
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,361
It's so important to just get this insight.

449
00:36:06,361 --> 00:36:12,041
Of course, something happens on the physical level, and then something else sends a home of the brain and does something.

450
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:16,761
And then there's an experience of unified objects.

451
00:36:16,761 --> 00:36:25,320
You never have a mental operation unifying partial experience of objects in Merrill Kanti.

452
00:36:25,801 --> 00:36:42,680
And Merochant's way of saying that is you don't have any access to the body schema except as you plunge into actively coping with unified objects, then you can say that happens thanks to the body schema.

453
00:36:42,681 --> 00:36:45,560
But the body schema is sort of invisible.

454
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:49,081
You can't say, if you say anything about it, you become an intellectualist.

455
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:56,001
It's just the name for the fact that somehow or other the nervous system is doing this.

456
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,201
And that's all.

457
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,361
You can explain the quote on the next page.

458
00:36:59,841 --> 00:37:00,321
Wait, wait, wait.

459
00:37:01,361 --> 00:37:01,600
Good.

460
00:37:01,841 --> 00:37:03,440
People are beginning to tell me when they're lost.

461
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,120
No, I have a quick question.

462
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:11,440
I think the other thing process here is the same thing, the intellectualism compared to the Pokemon.

463
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,560
The only difference is that the intellectualist even has some account of it.

464
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,000
They can actually say what it is.

465
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,360
Well, that's good.

466
00:37:19,361 --> 00:37:20,161
That's good.

467
00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:22,401
But that's not right, wait, wait, wait, wait.

468
00:37:22,401 --> 00:37:23,440
No, that's important.

469
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:25,201
That's right.

470
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:30,081
But it's not quite right because the question is deeper.

471
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,841
What is being unified?

472
00:37:31,841 --> 00:37:45,761
The intellectualist thinks he knows what's being unified, namely perspectives or features or what the sort of sense data-like stuff is being, but mental stuff is being unified.

473
00:37:45,761 --> 00:38:00,241
What's very important is the Duo-Gibson move, which is just sort of outside of the Merrill Price's concerns, but that something's being unified, all right, but it's not anything mental, and the unification is not anything mental.

474
00:38:00,401 --> 00:38:09,601
You were saying the unification isn't mental, but you've got to realize that there isn't any problem about how to unify any sort of experiences.

475
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,280
By the time you get to experiences, it's all unified already.

476
00:38:13,281 --> 00:38:14,160
That's the picture.

477
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,840
If you keep that in mind, you will not go crazy and will not leave out, I'm afraid.

478
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,921
At least not as I understand it.

479
00:38:21,921 --> 00:38:22,320
Yeah.

480
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:52,201
So the second sentence of the chapter is: when I walk around my class, the various aspects of the Duke of Aristoteli, did not possibly appear as views of one and the same thing if I did not know that each of them represents the flats and identified one another, and if I were unaware of my movements and of my values now, why isn't that being moved by his own voice?

481
00:38:52,201 --> 00:38:55,000
Well, okay, well let's talk about it.

482
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,521
It's good to see.

483
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,841
It's a challenge.

484
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:14,201
I don't know whether yet I have to think about it, whether I think it's supposed to be something said at a level of generality that you can both give an intellectualist view of a story and his story, but let's see.

485
00:39:14,201 --> 00:39:18,041
So our own body is in the world as the heart is in the organism.

486
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,921
That's another.

487
00:39:18,921 --> 00:39:22,361
Notice again how the picture is supposed to be.

488
00:39:22,681 --> 00:39:27,080
There's one big unity of the body in the world.

489
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,321
It keeps the spectacle constant alive.

490
00:39:29,321 --> 00:39:30,200
It breathes into it.

491
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:32,280
Boy, our metaphors and so forth.

492
00:39:32,281 --> 00:40:00,841
When I walk around my flat, the various aspects in which it presents itself to me, now I think that's fine, and I like to use the aspects, could not, and it's the whole flat presenting itself from various aspects, could not possibly appear as views of one and the same thing, that is, the room from an aspect, if I did not know that each of them, and no is going to turn out to be very important, did not know that each of them represents the flat seen from one spot or another.

493
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:01,960
That's odd.

494
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,960
Is that true in the French?

495
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,761
Knows and represents?

496
00:40:06,761 --> 00:40:08,040
Now that's interesting.

497
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,000
Why is he?

498
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,321
You see, knows, I just don't want to lose you.

499
00:40:11,321 --> 00:40:13,320
Knows sounds too intellectualist.

500
00:40:13,321 --> 00:40:15,320
Represents sounds very intellectualist.

501
00:40:15,401 --> 00:40:16,440
Why does he say anything that?

502
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,480
Well, it's not just knows.

503
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:24,440
Having some kind of access to the analyzed broken down hands of views.

504
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,200
So it seems that he's just a judge.

505
00:40:27,281 --> 00:40:30,080
There's no line of view or individual experience.

506
00:40:30,401 --> 00:40:32,560
Well, you know, I don't see any broken down points of view.

507
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,200
Where are they broken?

508
00:40:33,281 --> 00:40:38,721
They're aspects, and in each of them, that is each perspective on the object.

509
00:40:38,721 --> 00:40:41,440
That's the aspects in which it presents itself.

510
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,000
That's right.

511
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,480
The whole object presents itself to me.

512
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,600
The aspects of the intercept.

513
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,040
Of which I'm known.

514
00:40:49,361 --> 00:40:52,080
And each of them represents.

515
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,401
That's very odd.

516
00:40:54,401 --> 00:40:55,280
I got you.

517
00:40:55,281 --> 00:40:55,600
Yes.

518
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,120
I can make sense of that.

519
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,440
I mean, but I don't know yet what to say.

520
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:22,960
I mean, to say it in Mero-Ponty's terms, you'd have to say each of the aspects is an openness on, or our access to, the flat, the whole flat, seen from some place or other in lived space, not in objective space, but someplace or other in the coping space.

521
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:30,960
And it would have to, and represents, couldn't be right, I mean, if it's from a Merlot-Ponty point of view, because then what would be represented?

522
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:40,960
I mean, it's all, I'm just open to the whole flat, and I'm, and I'm in a lived space with it, so I don't need to know objectively where I am, and I don't have to represent anything.

523
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,640
I mean, I don't know what you're able to make of it.

524
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:42,881
Yeah.

525
00:41:42,881 --> 00:41:45,361
So 150 plus dollars flat again.

526
00:41:45,361 --> 00:41:45,841
Okay.

527
00:41:45,841 --> 00:41:46,720
Let's try it.

528
00:41:46,721 --> 00:41:50,080
Okay, wait, 150 or 150 is.

529
00:41:50,401 --> 00:41:51,761
Oh, is my flat screen?

530
00:41:51,841 --> 00:41:53,600
No, wait, wait, wait, wait, we all go to 150.

531
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,480
This is important.

532
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:56,881
Just clear about Meryl-Ponty's flat.

533
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:58,800
Okay, I see that about 10 lines down.

534
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,241
Look, good.

535
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,401
My fly is for me, not as closely associated with images.

536
00:42:04,401 --> 00:42:13,800
It remains familiar to the name of Romney Doggy is only as long as I still have in my hands or in my legs the main distances and directions involved.

537
00:42:09,761 --> 00:42:17,160
And as long as from my body, intentional threads run out towards it.

538
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:20,120
Clearly, my party thoughts are not a final game.

539
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:25,640
They continue to draw their substance from my present thought, they often be immune, but I give it back to them.

540
00:42:27,241 --> 00:42:29,480
I wish I could say that that was clinching.

541
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,361
Well, you get out of it.

542
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:36,120
I just thought it was talking about the state-brand situation in a way that does not depend on.

543
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,401
He doesn't say representation.

544
00:42:38,201 --> 00:42:39,480
It doesn't say aspect.

545
00:42:39,721 --> 00:42:40,680
That's nuts.

546
00:42:40,681 --> 00:42:45,241
But he does back here, and that's what we're sort of struggling with.

547
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:50,200
What I think that I have, I'm a boy, this requires a careful reading.

548
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,200
But what about represents?

549
00:42:54,201 --> 00:42:55,640
Why does he say they represent?

550
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,200
Why doesn't he say that they just open on the house?

551
00:42:58,201 --> 00:43:00,040
I mean, representative intellectualism.

552
00:43:00,281 --> 00:43:02,200
Represent is not written in the French sentence.

553
00:43:02,201 --> 00:43:03,801
It's not in the French sentence.

554
00:43:03,801 --> 00:43:04,281
It is.

555
00:43:05,241 --> 00:43:06,041
It is.

556
00:43:06,361 --> 00:43:07,960
There's a moment of hope.

557
00:43:08,281 --> 00:43:11,640
Well, the thing is, there's two different meanings of representation in the book.

558
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:20,281
And I mean, in various passages that I could cite now or after the book, he says that a part of the world represents another.

559
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,000
Does he?

560
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:21,880
Yes.

561
00:43:21,881 --> 00:43:22,841
Ah, so it's not.

562
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,761
I was going to talk about that today.

563
00:43:24,761 --> 00:43:26,281
Wow, that's good.

564
00:43:26,281 --> 00:43:28,921
You see, I'll explain this, not lose you now.

565
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:32,440
Represent could mean you could describe it separately.

566
00:43:33,801 --> 00:43:34,120
Right.

567
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:43,560
It could mean that the representation can be taken apart from what it represents as a separate thing and then has a relation of representation.

568
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,561
That's how beliefs relate to the world.

569
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,121
That's how propositions relate to the world.

570
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:51,480
They are all separable from what they represent.

571
00:43:51,480 --> 00:44:05,921
However, he has a kind of intentionality in which, and this is about intentionality, in which what does the representing and what is represented are not separable from the whole, but are aspects of the whole.

572
00:44:05,921 --> 00:44:19,041
But what Olivier is saying, and I was going to come up to it in lecture in a little while, we'll get there, is that he has, I didn't know what two meanings represent, but he clearly has two meanings of intentionality.

573
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:30,160
For him, it's a case of intentionality that a spot on a background, a spot seems to have the background going on behind it.

574
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,081
Why is that intentionality?

575
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:37,440
Because the way it looks already implies that this is behind it.

576
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,881
It implies, again, not in an intellectualist way, it looks as if it's covering up this background.

577
00:44:42,881 --> 00:44:53,921
As soon as anything in the whole looks like it does, because it's a part of the whole, that counts as intentionality in the L Ponty.

578
00:44:53,921 --> 00:44:58,241
Very different, because it doesn't mean that you can take the intentional content.

579
00:44:58,401 --> 00:45:00,641
I'm talking to Searleans now mostly.

580
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:05,681
You can't separate the intentional content from what it's about.

581
00:45:05,681 --> 00:45:11,200
That's representational intentionality in the Searle sense, and it's propositional.

582
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:24,401
And then there's another view in the LOP where there is intentionality, but there isn't a content, something propositional, something that you can separate from what it's about.

583
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,281
If the pieces of the spot are all just about each other.

584
00:45:28,281 --> 00:45:40,601
Everything that the spot is, every way the spot looks, lighter in the center, darker around the edges, lighting's covering up the paper it's a spot on, all that is intentionality.

585
00:45:39,841 --> 00:45:44,761
All that has intentional threads, and it would be representational, I think, in one sense.

586
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,960
One part of the spot represents some other part of the spot.

587
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:48,520
You see?

588
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,240
Okay, good.

589
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,761
380 in the front edition.

590
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:05,720
He's saying that there is a transition between aspects of the objects.

591
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:08,120
So you never achieved any synthesis at all.

592
00:46:10,361 --> 00:46:12,921
Yes, transition synthesis, yes.

593
00:46:12,921 --> 00:46:17,241
But he says that this one is prior to the other one and that you can remain in the system.

594
00:46:17,401 --> 00:46:18,680
See, now you're losing people.

595
00:46:18,681 --> 00:46:20,040
So let me just say it.

596
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:26,201
What we're worrying about is that, well, now we've got something for you all to worry about.

597
00:46:26,361 --> 00:46:37,240
When you see intentionality, you've got to be careful and pay attention to the difference between what he means by it and what you mean by it from any other course you've ever had, influenced by Frege, Thurley, and company.

598
00:46:37,241 --> 00:46:38,521
Not that they're wrong.

599
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,641
There's a kind of intentionality for mental stuff.

600
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,560
Beliefs are about the world.

601
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,680
That's intentionality.

602
00:46:44,681 --> 00:46:46,361
They represent the world.

603
00:46:46,841 --> 00:46:48,120
But that's not his use.

604
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:51,480
It's neither his use of intentionality nor represent.

605
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,320
And what was the word we were just talking about?

606
00:46:53,321 --> 00:46:54,120
Transition synthesis.

607
00:46:54,201 --> 00:46:55,641
Oh, yeah, and synthesis.

608
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,801
Synthesis is going to have two meanings.

609
00:46:58,841 --> 00:47:08,280
If synthesis means that there are elements and then some intellectual something that puts together the elements, that's intellectualism.

610
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,601
Whether it's hussarl or not, it would be a discussion we don't have to have here.

611
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,761
But it's intellectualism for sure.

612
00:47:14,761 --> 00:47:21,160
And when he says synthesis, transition synthesis in the passage that Olivier is reading.

613
00:47:21,401 --> 00:47:30,800
That just means that as you go around the house, and the passage that Al was starting with, you get changing aspects of the whole house.

614
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,960
That's the transition synthesis.

615
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:38,881
That's got a different meaning synthesis, different meaning of representation, different meaning of intentionality.

616
00:47:38,881 --> 00:47:41,840
And you can always ask yourself which it is.

617
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,560
There are two ways to find out about which it is.

618
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:49,761
One is, does it believe that the elements are definable apart from their place in the whole?

619
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:52,320
If so, it's intellectualist.

620
00:47:52,321 --> 00:47:55,760
And Merloponte doesn't believe it.

621
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:03,681
Does it think that there is some kind of mental, understandable operation that puts the elements together in the whole?

622
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:07,041
If so, that's intellectualist, and Merlopunge doesn't buy it.

623
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,040
Okay, you'll be willing to say something.

624
00:48:09,841 --> 00:48:17,280
Maybe you're making it more positive than it should be, because why can't you just say that he's just Melopanti is just eating?

625
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,281
We talk about middle and representation.

626
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:27,120
Well, I would say that, except Olivier has says that it's all over the book like this, that there are two means of representation.

627
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,361
I really it's a perfectly sensible question.

628
00:48:29,361 --> 00:48:35,120
I couldn't defend myself except by saying Olivier thinks that, and he said he does more than I have.

629
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:35,681
What?

630
00:48:35,681 --> 00:48:43,600
Because it seems like there's you can also read him as saying, you know, saying that, you know, hasn't endorsed being holy.

631
00:48:43,761 --> 00:48:45,360
Well, yes, you have to read it.

632
00:48:45,361 --> 00:48:58,881
Okay, well, I'm not disagreeing with you with what you but I am making it hard uh I don't think I'm making it harder for I mean he he's basically saying what you're saying, but he's just using like those right.

633
00:48:58,681 --> 00:48:59,000
Right.

634
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,361
But once you do, there's no disa disagreement between us.

635
00:49:02,361 --> 00:49:10,120
Once you do, I'm not making it harder than it is, that there then there are two meanings of represent running around, and you've got to keep your eyes open for which.

636
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,721
And two meanings of no, and you've got to keep your eyes open for which.

637
00:49:09,761 --> 00:49:15,321
Two meanings of intentionality.

638
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,960
And I'm just telling you that, and it's difficult.

639
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,681
But in the end, I'm saying just what you're saying.

640
00:49:20,681 --> 00:49:23,561
Don't worry about the fact that he says represent and no.

641
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:32,521
He doesn't mean no in the sense that it's sort of accessible to the mind, and he doesn't mean represent in the sense that it's about anything that's separate from him.

642
00:49:32,841 --> 00:49:34,040
Look, so it goes.

643
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:34,361
Yeah.

644
00:49:35,241 --> 00:49:38,040
Okay, let's go right to that because we're so close to that.

645
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,200
I'll just jump ahead in the lecture.

646
00:49:40,361 --> 00:49:48,760
I have a whole section on where he just goes off and decides to tell you, pretty late in the game, what he means by intentionality.

647
00:49:48,761 --> 00:49:50,521
So where is it now?

648
00:49:51,401 --> 00:49:56,361
If anybody finds it in my notes, let me tell them, I mean, it must be in here.

649
00:49:56,681 --> 00:49:58,521
We want you to talk about it.

650
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,081
I may not call it by that name.

651
00:50:01,401 --> 00:50:02,120
Maybe.

652
00:50:02,761 --> 00:50:04,440
Well, let's look at 213.

653
00:50:04,841 --> 00:50:05,720
No marks to me.

654
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:06,761
There's a thing in here.

655
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,281
Well, I ought to be able just to find out.

656
00:50:11,881 --> 00:50:12,761
Yeah, I think you'll.

657
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:14,680
Good.

658
00:50:14,921 --> 00:50:16,361
That's weird.

659
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,361
I wrote this thing.

660
00:50:18,361 --> 00:50:19,881
Ah, here it is.

661
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,120
It's on 248 of ours.

662
00:50:22,361 --> 00:50:26,841
I wrote it on my notes, not in terms of intentionality, but you'll see why I could write it that way.

663
00:50:26,841 --> 00:50:30,440
All figure ground structure is holistic and meaningful.

664
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:39,720
That's code for when we see that the holistic structure has its kind of internal kind of version of intentionality.

665
00:50:39,721 --> 00:50:42,841
Now, let me see where it is on 248.

666
00:50:42,801 --> 00:50:43,640
Now, okay, here it is.

667
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,241
Pop at 248.

668
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,361
Now, Mero Pandit is talking.

669
00:50:48,361 --> 00:50:53,080
This is what we are doing when we define a sensation as coexistent or communion.

670
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,120
Never mind that yet.

671
00:50:54,120 --> 00:51:05,520
The sensation of blue is not the knowledge or positing of a certain identifiable quality, that's one of those features things, throughout all the experiences which I have.

672
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:13,921
As if, let me just say, as if blue is like a color chip in which it's the same blue in a woolly carpet.

673
00:51:14,241 --> 00:51:15,921
I think I like red better.

674
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:30,960
You mustn't think that just because the fire engine is red and the apple is red and the carpet is red, and that the same color chip for paint matches all three of them, that these reds look alike.

675
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,520
There's the woolly red of the carpet, he says, or blue.

676
00:51:33,681 --> 00:51:36,160
In one place, he says one or two says another.

677
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:36,881
It doesn't matter.

678
00:51:36,881 --> 00:51:46,881
There's the woolly, let's say, red of the carpet, the shiny red of the fire engine, the juicy red of the apple, and they look juicy or hard or fuzzy.

679
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,440
That's this whole issue that's going to come up next time.

680
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,840
I can see we're not going to get there, a synesthesia.

681
00:51:53,841 --> 00:52:04,560
That is that all these, because the whole body is coming to grips with the whole object, all the properties aren't separable, like atoms of qualia.

682
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:11,761
But the blueness is already going to be given as permeated by woolliness or whatever.

683
00:52:12,241 --> 00:52:13,200
Now let's go on.

684
00:52:13,201 --> 00:52:16,080
The sensation of blue, but let me generalize.

685
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:27,440
Remember, whenever you see him denying, you'll always see him denying there are these sense data-like elements which remain the same and then get plugged into the experience.

686
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,960
For him, it's always holistic and top-down.

687
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,321
There are no elements.

688
00:52:32,321 --> 00:52:36,720
Blue already shows up either as woolly's blue or shiny blue or whatever.

689
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:37,761
That's what he's saying.

690
00:52:37,761 --> 00:52:44,841
The sensation of blue is not the knowledge of or positive of a certain indefinable quality throughout all the experiences that I have of it.

691
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:48,360
That would be fire engines, rugs, and so forth.

692
00:52:48,361 --> 00:52:52,521
As the geometric circle is the same in Paris and Tokyo.

693
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,080
It is, in all probability, intentional.

694
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,040
I don't know about in all probability, I can't imagine what that does.

695
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,921
It is intentional, which means that it.

696
00:53:00,921 --> 00:53:03,881
Is that in all probability in there, Olivia?

697
00:53:03,881 --> 00:53:04,440
Oh, sorry.

698
00:53:05,801 --> 00:53:07,321
Are you seeing where I'm reading?

699
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,480
Anybody in the French?

700
00:53:10,361 --> 00:53:11,881
Okay, well, I'll go on.

701
00:53:11,881 --> 00:53:15,400
I don't know, I'd be nice if that phrase went away because it doesn't do anything.

702
00:53:15,801 --> 00:53:26,440
It is, I'm skipping it, intentional, which means that it does not rest in itself as does a thing, that it is directive and has significance beyond itself.

703
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:33,721
So, now that's the general definition of intentionality, having significance beyond itself.

704
00:53:34,281 --> 00:53:39,880
It's in there, which can you imagine why he would say in all probability that quality is just intentional?

705
00:53:39,881 --> 00:53:41,561
I mean, if it's normal.

706
00:53:42,681 --> 00:53:47,080
Maybe he means if you've got some kind of mental breakdown or something, you could see pure blue.

707
00:53:47,321 --> 00:53:48,681
I think he thinks that.

708
00:53:48,681 --> 00:53:51,320
But maybe Schneider sees pure blue.

709
00:53:51,321 --> 00:54:00,680
But if normal people are going to see only the quality from the aspect blue, the carpet, I'm now seeing under the aspect blue, but it's still a carpet.

710
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,121
Okay, and but now this is the crucial phrase.

711
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:12,201
Because he thinks intentionality means directed, and that means has significance beyond it.

712
00:54:12,201 --> 00:54:16,761
Well, of course, one thing that has intentionality, let's keep repeating, is belief.

713
00:54:16,761 --> 00:54:18,841
They're directed at the world.

714
00:54:18,841 --> 00:54:22,521
And their intentionality is because they're about something.

715
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:28,801
And they have conditions of satisfaction, namely, the world can turn out to be like you believe it or not like you believe it.

716
00:54:30,401 --> 00:54:33,040
How many people is that a familiar thing, I just say?

717
00:54:33,681 --> 00:54:36,721
Okay, because it's something that you need to know.

718
00:54:36,721 --> 00:54:44,401
I mean, that's the mentalist Surley and Serlean understanding of intentionality or the basic one.

719
00:54:44,401 --> 00:54:49,681
Now, Merilo Ponte thinks, you could generalize that.

720
00:54:49,681 --> 00:54:54,641
Intentionality is just when anything has a significance beyond itself.

721
00:54:54,640 --> 00:55:03,201
So when the house looks like the front of a house, there's intentionality there.

722
00:55:03,201 --> 00:55:10,480
Not from your mind being about the house, but the front of the house is, so to speak, about the back of the house.

723
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,281
And for him, that's a kind of intentionality.

724
00:55:13,281 --> 00:55:18,080
Gurvich has a nice phrase that probably Merilo-Ponte got this for which.

725
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:23,041
He talks about, oh my gosh, I just certainly forgot it because I was going to say it.

726
00:55:23,681 --> 00:55:25,600
Perceptual implications.

727
00:55:26,401 --> 00:55:34,800
That means that the way the house looks, it implies the back, but it's not a rational implies, or therefore a logical implies.

728
00:55:35,361 --> 00:55:37,600
Maybe Figurich is a double agent.

729
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,240
You never know.

730
00:55:38,241 --> 00:55:39,521
So I'll stick to this.

731
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:43,681
The front of the house looks like the front of a house.

732
00:55:43,681 --> 00:55:45,520
That's intentionality already.

733
00:55:45,841 --> 00:55:46,240
Yeah.

734
00:55:47,361 --> 00:55:49,761
I would say probably what?

735
00:55:51,040 --> 00:56:09,120
Yes, the perceptual house, the house in this perceived world that we perceive, the front of the house has intentionality because it shows itself as the front of a house.

736
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:13,161
Now, wait, I've got other passages because that's such an amazing thing to say.

737
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:28,360
So on 249, about two-thirds down, he talks about the mutual, how each part of the whole is sensitive, in quotes, to what happens in all the others and knows them dynamically.

738
00:56:28,681 --> 00:56:32,760
Well, there's a funny use of knows, which he puts in quotes, knows them dynamically.

739
00:56:32,761 --> 00:56:33,960
He puts in quotes.

740
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,361
He's quoting Kerr, which all this.

741
00:56:36,841 --> 00:56:45,160
But what's going on there is a way of talking about how the part, sorry, there are no parts.

742
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:49,721
Each part of the whole is an aspect to put in if you want.

743
00:56:49,721 --> 00:56:56,600
Although part, you know, part could be an element or there are certain words you can talk about.

744
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:57,960
Yeah, I agree.

745
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,881
You can talk about parts as long as you don't think it's...

746
00:57:00,841 --> 00:57:01,960
They're lined by the whole structure.

747
00:57:02,361 --> 00:57:02,760
That's right.

748
00:57:02,761 --> 00:57:05,640
You can talk about parts as long as they are like aspects.

749
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,281
They are not elements or features.

750
00:57:08,281 --> 00:57:13,081
As long as they're not atomic, as long as you couldn't take them out, then it's all right, a part.

751
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:23,560
So, and the part is like the front of the house, the front of the house, which already is sensitive to and knows dynamically that there's a back.

752
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:24,761
And what does that mean?

753
00:57:24,761 --> 00:57:27,401
It looks like it's hiding a back.

754
00:57:27,401 --> 00:57:27,960
Yeah.

755
00:57:28,921 --> 00:57:32,200
I just want to register the strangeness of this use usage.

756
00:57:32,201 --> 00:57:35,800
I mean, it sounds like to me he's assimilating intentionality, the whole thing.

757
00:57:36,201 --> 00:57:38,280
I think he's, well, I have to think about it.

758
00:57:38,281 --> 00:57:46,440
But I mean, I think he wants to say that he would he needs some way, maybe intentionality is a bad word because it's already been taken.

759
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,960
Frega paid for it, and everybody is he's got he owns it.

760
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:53,720
But or well, whoever did, Brentano, I guess, owns it.

761
00:57:53,721 --> 00:58:04,881
But anyway, there is a meaning for intentionality around, but he needs to say in some way how the aspects refer beyond themselves.

762
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:11,841
And it can't be refer in the way that representations, the way beliefs refer about the world.

763
00:58:11,841 --> 00:58:18,001
But and so he needs a word for the sensitivity of the aspects to each other.

764
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,721
And maybe he shouldn't call it intentionality.

765
00:58:20,721 --> 00:58:26,240
He calls it, you know, he's got intentionality in it's intentional tissue.

766
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,721
I mean it says intentional.

767
00:58:28,721 --> 00:58:31,841
Yeah, okay, well there, but there's intentionality around.

768
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:34,001
Let's see, intentional there.

769
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,921
Carc knowing something.

770
00:58:36,241 --> 00:58:38,000
I'll find an intentionality.

771
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,720
By the way, let me tell you, and then I'll find it.

772
00:58:40,721 --> 00:58:43,761
There's the intentional tissue talk.

773
00:58:43,761 --> 00:58:46,401
There's the intentional arc talk.

774
00:58:46,401 --> 00:58:48,001
Those are all the same things.

775
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,600
Those are all holistic kind of intentionality talk.

776
00:58:51,841 --> 00:58:57,281
But I hope I can find another invention that will help let's look around.

777
00:58:57,281 --> 00:58:59,281
I thought I had several.

778
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:04,400
But Romero Ponty, I wrote him, meaningful equals intentional.

779
00:59:04,721 --> 00:59:09,921
Oh, oh yeah, I thought I would try to explain what the this is a challenge.

780
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,161
You want intentionality always to have conditions of satisfaction.

781
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,841
That's what makes it intentionality.

782
00:59:15,921 --> 00:59:21,040
So sort of an answer here, partly we can deal with what James said.

783
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:29,440
The excuse for calling this intentionality would be to say, but it's got conditions of satisfaction and therefore why shouldn't we call it intentionality?

784
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,801
Now look what happens.

785
00:59:30,801 --> 00:59:51,960
If the front of the house looks like it's hiding the back, and that is, it has the, it implies that, it's got that intentionality, it refers beyond itself, and you go around and you discover there's no back, you just failed to satisfy the conditions of satisfaction.

786
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:58,361
It's a version of if you believe that there's a back and there's no back, your belief is false.

787
00:59:58,361 --> 01:00:02,520
But it wasn't a back, that would be a kind of representing, the belief one.

788
01:00:02,681 --> 01:00:09,641
But if this it has the characteristic of a representing without a representing, namely it looks already as if it's hiding a back.

789
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:17,321
And so how would you, I want you to know this because someday this problem is going to hit you and I might as well save you from a night of puzzlement.

790
01:00:17,321 --> 01:00:24,601
But if the front looks like it's hiding a back, then how could it turn out that there wasn't a back?

791
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:30,121
And I've already said this with the girl on Telegraph.

792
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:35,401
Well, it will stop looking that way when you go back and look at it again.

793
01:00:35,401 --> 01:00:37,640
That's how you can see that it's failed.

794
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:43,560
I mean, if the one place Pussyl says that no email explodes, you can't quite say that.

795
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:53,881
But you say, well, your expectations and all your sets for the house go clong, bong, like with the back of the girl, and all of a sudden it's different.

796
01:00:54,201 --> 01:00:55,720
And then that's what happens.

797
01:00:55,721 --> 01:00:57,400
That's falsification.

798
01:00:57,401 --> 01:01:00,680
It gets, and the funny thing is, let's go through all this.

799
01:01:00,681 --> 01:01:02,761
It gets retroactively crossed out.

800
01:01:03,721 --> 01:01:04,761
What does that mean?

801
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:10,121
I can't even remember what the back of the girl looked like because it's clearly the back of a guy.

802
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:13,641
So that my memories get changed when it goes wrong.

803
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,160
I think that's generally right.

804
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:19,640
It's like if you see the cat in the trees, you'd be trying to solve this puzzle and all you see is trees.

805
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:22,440
And in one moment, bomb, you see the cat in the tree.

806
01:01:22,681 --> 01:01:25,760
Can you remember the trees before the cat was there?

807
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:26,641
No.

808
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,801
Retroactively, it's got a new intentionality.

809
01:01:30,801 --> 01:01:32,801
It's got a new conditions of satisfaction.

810
01:01:32,801 --> 01:01:34,401
That is now a cat.

811
01:01:34,401 --> 01:01:38,560
And so the important thing is, and I was going to do it with the block.

812
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:46,480
I decided I had to see if I could do it with the spot on the paper, because that's his minimal difficulty.

813
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:53,281
Remember, you seem like years ago when we started the book, there was a spot on a piece of paper and he went on and on about it.

814
01:01:53,281 --> 01:01:57,680
I think I should tell you where it is, because I can't expect you to have a grasp of this book.

815
01:01:57,681 --> 01:02:01,520
No one has where is it, the spot on the paper.

816
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,921
Oh, where's the woolly red carpet on page five?

817
01:02:03,921 --> 01:02:05,200
Who would have thought?

818
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,360
Everything is everywhere.

819
01:02:07,681 --> 01:02:11,600
He's written a holistic book, it occurred to me this morning as I was breaking my teeth.

820
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:16,881
No wonder you can't tell where anything is, because anything belongs everywhere.

821
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,761
Because everything else implies everything.

822
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:26,640
Well, you you can know your way around it in spite of that fact.

823
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:39,440
But what you can't do, you know, is nowhere to look for anything because who would have thought the carpet issue right in the middle of page five here is something which is really going to be discussed only when we get to the thing.

824
01:02:39,681 --> 01:02:42,240
We haven't even got to the carpet issue.

825
01:02:42,241 --> 01:02:45,921
But if we can sit in what I'm looking for, the spot.

826
01:02:45,921 --> 01:02:47,841
The spot is very early on.

827
01:02:47,841 --> 01:02:49,520
Can I just make a an observation?

828
01:02:49,681 --> 01:02:49,841
Yeah.

829
01:02:51,281 --> 01:03:04,000
You might think that just extending your thought about the intentionality of on the house, that the fact that it moves, Pizza Jets is being mentioned on the weird.

830
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:09,040
Well, because after all, a belief is the only about us to go so long as you do it.

831
01:03:09,681 --> 01:03:10,040
Right.

832
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:13,001
And very false.

833
01:03:09,841 --> 01:03:16,040
And in between, then it'll be false.

834
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:17,560
That's interesting.

835
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:19,080
That's very interesting.

836
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:19,800
That's right.

837
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:25,401
That's one of the important differences, whether you're a holist with your intentionality and representation story.

838
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:25,800
Right.

839
01:03:25,801 --> 01:03:30,841
Notice your belief, even when it turns out to be false, that's a good thing to point out.

840
01:03:30,841 --> 01:03:33,960
You still can have the belief, and now you know it's false.

841
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:47,561
But when your look at the girl from the back turns out to be a man from the back, you can't continue to have that look of the girl from the back and with the event attached to it, false, misleading.

842
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:48,520
It stiffs.

843
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,360
It starts looking completely different.

844
01:03:52,841 --> 01:03:55,801
In fact, so life is in first person.

845
01:03:55,801 --> 01:03:58,680
Once you know the belief is false, then you can't believe it.

846
01:03:58,681 --> 01:03:59,080
That's true.

847
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,000
It loses a dystopic way to do that.

848
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:01,720
It's truth.

849
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:02,761
That's right, right.

850
01:04:02,841 --> 01:04:03,721
Justice will have to do it.

851
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:04,361
Okay, good.

852
01:04:04,361 --> 01:04:05,640
That's the other half of it.

853
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:14,601
It's, I mean, but you can separate the proposition you believe from and entertain it without believing it.

854
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:25,320
Whereas on this story, you can't entertain the look of the back of the girl while knowing that it's the look of, well, while you're looking at the back of what we now know is a man.

855
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:29,161
So let me tell you about the spot, the middle of page four.

856
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:33,401
This is the minimum intentionality, though he doesn't call it that.

857
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:48,681
He says, when Gestalt theory informs us that a figure on the background is the simplest Thanksgiving available to us, Thanksgiving is uh going to do this job of perceptual reburring.

858
01:04:48,681 --> 01:04:53,081
We rely, we reply that it's not a contingent characteristic and so forth.

859
01:04:53,120 --> 01:05:01,200
Huh, uh, no, I he's saying it's always part of a field, he says, but I where do you give a description of this?

860
01:05:01,201 --> 01:05:01,921
Oh, here it is.

861
01:05:01,921 --> 01:05:04,241
I'm sorry, page four, higher up.

862
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:07,600
Let us imagine a white patch on a homogeneous background.

863
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:11,921
All the points of the patch have a certain function in common, forming themselves into a shape.

864
01:05:11,921 --> 01:05:15,120
The color of the shape is more intense and more resistant than the background.

865
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:19,841
The edges of the patch belong to part belong to it and are not part of the background although they join it.

866
01:05:19,841 --> 01:05:23,841
The patch appears to be placed on the background and does not break it up.

867
01:05:23,841 --> 01:05:27,041
And now comes the third intentionalist part.

868
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:32,081
H path arouses the expectations of more than it contains.

869
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:36,160
And this elementary perception is therefore already tied with meaning.

870
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,361
I would rather say sense.

871
01:05:37,361 --> 01:05:40,321
I think you better leave meaning for belief.

872
01:05:40,321 --> 01:05:43,841
Sense is is this more minimal thing.

873
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:48,400
So the word in French is sales, and so it's better to call it meaning.

874
01:05:48,721 --> 01:05:50,560
I mean, sorry, call it sense.

875
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:54,560
Okay, and but here he's certainly using the this minimal meaning, no?

876
01:05:55,361 --> 01:05:57,281
Okay, well, everything has two meanings.

877
01:05:57,281 --> 01:05:58,320
That was crazy.

878
01:05:59,761 --> 01:06:01,841
I don't forget I want to say anything more.

879
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,840
So it's one thing I'd love to say more.

880
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:13,120
Oh, I gave myself the puzzle of every if it's going to be intentionality, it's got to have conditions of satisfaction.

881
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,321
So we did it with belief.

882
01:06:14,321 --> 01:06:16,720
That was we did it with houseburns.

883
01:06:16,721 --> 01:06:20,480
What about the spot, which is covering up the background behind it?

884
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,960
Has it got it whoops as if the background continues behind it?

885
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:36,881
Well, if you picked up the spot, if you could, or or erased it and there was a hole behind it, and it covered exactly this hole, but there were but the white paper didn't continue, you'd be wrong.

886
01:06:36,881 --> 01:06:38,560
And the spot would look different.

887
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:45,160
Because the spot, the spot, there are conditions of satisfaction for the way the spot looks.

888
01:06:39,681 --> 01:06:47,560
That's what makes it intentionality.

889
01:06:47,561 --> 01:06:52,681
And so that now just part of the answer to you, that's the generalist thing you can say about intentionality.

890
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:55,881
It refers beyond itself.

891
01:06:55,881 --> 01:07:04,761
It could be mental content referring beyond itself to the world, but it could be a part of the gestalt referring beyond itself to the rest of the gestalt.

892
01:07:04,761 --> 01:07:07,881
In either case, you've got conditions of satisfaction.

893
01:07:07,881 --> 01:07:09,320
It can be misleading.

894
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:14,040
It can turn out to surprise you, and you turn out to be wrong.

895
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:16,841
It looked like it looked different than it now looks.

896
01:07:16,841 --> 01:07:17,240
Yeah.

897
01:07:17,721 --> 01:07:19,160
This just seems to exist about me.

898
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:29,960
I mean, lots of people have a view you just described, but if you have a representationalist view about a perceptual experience like this, you're not going to be experiencing the world.

899
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,561
You're not going to be involved in the world.

900
01:07:31,721 --> 01:07:33,960
Well, I'm not being, I'm not lost to you.

901
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:41,560
I'm saying you can only experience seeing the front as the front of a house with a back if you're actively engaged with the house.

902
01:07:41,561 --> 01:07:42,841
The same thing with the spot.

903
01:07:43,641 --> 01:07:46,921
As soon as you stand back and look at them, he says this often.

904
01:07:46,921 --> 01:07:48,040
They just become features.

905
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:54,120
But the problem is that if there's conditions of satisfaction, what you're telling of how things might or might not be.

906
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:54,600
Yeah.

907
01:07:54,601 --> 01:08:01,960
And that the world is something, you know, removed from that, which, you know, is going to determine whether your experiences are horrible or not.

908
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,881
No, it's just more of the same.

909
01:08:03,881 --> 01:08:11,720
I mean, when you go around the back, and if the back turns out not to be there, it's not comparing your first experience to the real world.

910
01:08:11,721 --> 01:08:15,560
You're comparing your first experience to your next experience, which cancels it.

911
01:08:15,561 --> 01:08:18,120
And maybe it'll get the weak canceled.

912
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:24,921
Maybe it'll turn out somehow that the they discovered how to make it visible backs, but when you try to quit what you could would you bump into it.

913
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:25,841
And who knows?

914
01:08:25,841 --> 01:08:36,720
But it's all on the level of constantly negotiated and redefinable or re-experienceable as you find out more and more.

915
01:08:36,721 --> 01:08:43,280
And you're already committed to the future unfolding of this investor conditions of satisfaction.

916
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:46,960
You're committed to the future unfolding of it as a certain kind.

917
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:54,400
And when it isn't like that, Zach, you have to retroactively change it, even your memory of it.

918
01:08:54,641 --> 01:08:57,440
I had to say that sometimes, so this is as good a time as any.

919
01:08:57,921 --> 01:08:59,841
Now, I didn't lose you, I hope.

920
01:08:59,921 --> 01:09:00,960
Has anybody lost?

921
01:09:01,681 --> 01:09:02,560
That's good.

922
01:09:02,561 --> 01:09:04,240
Okay, you want to say something over here?

923
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:14,480
You tend to say that when you see that thing, either a real and telegraph idea or a man brothers, when you realize that it's a man on Telegraph and Union, you don't get down there.

924
01:09:14,721 --> 01:09:21,280
So you mean that you cannot remember the moment when you have thought it was a girl?

925
01:09:21,761 --> 01:09:22,561
No, I can remember.

926
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:23,841
I think.

927
01:09:23,841 --> 01:09:30,000
But this is this nothing crucial interest on this, except just I think it's helpful if it's true.

928
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,280
I think you can't picture what it looked like when it looked like the back of a view.

929
01:09:35,441 --> 01:09:36,481
You can't look at the use of it.

930
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:39,520
This is what he calls ambiguity.

931
01:09:40,881 --> 01:09:42,320
Ambiguity, yes.

932
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:45,601
It's a very crucial word that he uses for the booming.

933
01:09:45,601 --> 01:09:52,400
It means that it can be, maybe you expect it to be a girl because, well, there's a long hairload and this.

934
01:09:52,641 --> 01:09:58,240
Yeah, but I mean that's you it could be that you I mean, this is just getting at sort of I'm afraid uninteresting.

935
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,481
It could be you kept an ambiguity.

936
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:03,761
Yeah, well it that depends.

937
01:10:03,761 --> 01:10:04,881
This is too trivial.

938
01:10:04,881 --> 01:10:15,721
But I mean, you could either look at it with ambiguity and s and look at it in a way which you saw uh you were trying to stay neutral as to whether it was a man or a woman, or it could be either.

939
01:10:15,881 --> 01:10:17,000
That would be the ambiguity.

940
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,120
You just don't know yet.

941
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:22,360
If that's how you're looking at it, then it won't have to flip when you go around.

942
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:24,681
But that's a very abnormal way to look at it.

943
01:10:24,681 --> 01:10:36,280
When you're looking at it, you're it's it's like trying to say, I don't know whether I'm in a movie set or not, so I won't look at this as a facade, and I won't look at this as a house from the front, I'll leave it ambiguous.

944
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:40,680
Well, then it whatever it turns out to be, you won't retroactively change.

945
01:10:40,681 --> 01:10:49,240
But your basic coping involved thing is you look at it as the whole object, namely a girl or a a guy.

946
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:50,681
You don't look at it as ambiguous.

947
01:10:52,761 --> 01:10:53,641
Not necessary.

948
01:10:53,641 --> 01:10:55,000
You can stay ambiguous.

949
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,240
If you stay ambiguous, you can only do it.

950
01:10:57,481 --> 01:10:58,761
I don't choose to stay ambiguous.

951
01:10:58,841 --> 01:11:02,040
What the what this is is that the basic structure of perception is ambiguous.

952
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:03,320
Not in that sense.

953
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:11,480
Not in the sense that you not in the sense that the basic way of looking at a house remains neutral as to whether I'm looking at a facade or a house.

954
01:11:11,481 --> 01:11:20,200
That would be unbelievable if you said that, because the whole thing-key thing is you have to do it from an already engaged coping attitude.

955
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:24,280
And boy, when you're coping, you don't stay neutral as to whether you're going to go through the front door.

956
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:36,520
The house could be a facade and not a facade, but boy, if you you gotta look like one of the other things.

957
01:11:36,521 --> 01:11:37,480
That's what you don't know.

958
01:11:37,481 --> 01:11:43,561
You can stand back intellectually and say that, but that doesn't but the house looks like you you either gonna go and be able to go through the door.

959
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:46,921
Yes, that's right.

960
01:11:47,721 --> 01:11:48,681
It's open.

961
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:53,320
You're set to go you're involved.

962
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:56,240
You're set to go through the door, the front door.

963
01:11:54,441 --> 01:11:59,040
And the front door looks like it leads to the interior of the house.

964
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:12,400
It looks like it, and your body's set to go through it, and it's looking that way of two aspects of one thing, and then now y you you could try and go through it, and bang, you hit the the wall.

965
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:21,360
But normally you wouldn't stand back and say, well, it's the inner facade of the house, it's a door, it looks ambiguous, it looks like maybe I can go through it, maybe I can't.

966
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,960
That's not the normal experience.

967
01:12:25,761 --> 01:12:26,960
That's even worse.

968
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:33,360
I don't believe for a minute that the the house front looks sort of like a facade, it's sort of like a house.

969
01:12:35,521 --> 01:12:37,921
Is it the indeterminacy that really wants to be a little bit more?

970
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,681
No, that's not the kind of indeterminacy.

971
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:41,360
It either looks like a house.

972
01:12:41,441 --> 01:12:42,320
This is incredible.

973
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:43,280
This is an ingression.

974
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,881
It's a craziness.

975
01:12:44,881 --> 01:12:48,641
It either looks like the front of the house, which I would think it's indeterminate.

976
01:12:48,641 --> 01:12:53,120
What, whether it's how many windows it's got on the back, maybe it's got no windows on the back.

977
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:56,160
We'll never know about the cracks in the floor, he says, and all that.

978
01:12:56,481 --> 01:12:58,960
That's it's never completely determinate.

979
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:01,761
But that doesn't mean it isn't at all determinate.

980
01:13:01,761 --> 01:13:18,560
It doesn't mean that all I ever have is some possible something which could possibly be a front, possibly be a facade, possibly be a laser image, possibly be a hallucination, all ambiguous, and then I find out that's not that just makes no sense.

981
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:18,960
Yeah.

982
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:25,921
It seems like there's there's a problem that's actually inherently where there's three times the phenomenon, there's two times of experience.

983
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:30,720
So I think empiric would be the way it is, maybe an appearance in out the variance is not these ways.

984
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:37,520
So you need this thing, you need this kind of ambigenous to account for the fact of the illusion that you experience.

985
01:13:37,601 --> 01:13:39,480
So that's all, that's all.

986
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:42,921
I think what you're saying is probably true, but I just don't want to answer it.

987
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:44,360
Another ask.

988
01:13:39,521 --> 01:13:46,040
I don't want to bring in Heidegger.

989
01:13:46,761 --> 01:13:48,360
No, I just want to do the same phenomenon.

990
01:13:48,761 --> 01:13:50,280
So there is no problem.

991
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:55,801
There is no meaningless look of the object and ambiguous and massacres.

992
01:13:55,801 --> 01:13:57,400
That is already one way or the other.

993
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:00,521
And the fact that it's already one way or the other is what makes it the difference.

994
01:14:00,841 --> 01:14:06,200
Of course, if it's okay, if that's, I don't think that could be what they mean by ambiguous.

995
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:07,960
I mean, then it wouldn't be a way of looking.

996
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:14,040
Either it looks like it's already one way, or it looks like it's the other.

997
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,200
It doesn't look like it's one way or the other.

998
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:17,721
Okay, Jennifer wanted to say something.

999
01:14:17,721 --> 01:14:19,080
Wait, wait, I want to hear one more question.

1000
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:19,801
You sure?

1001
01:14:20,441 --> 01:14:21,240
You look very worried.

1002
01:14:21,721 --> 01:14:22,440
I am very worried.

1003
01:14:22,921 --> 01:14:23,960
Oh, tell me when you're worried about it.

1004
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:24,921
I'll tell you later.

1005
01:14:25,561 --> 01:14:26,841
I'm worried when you're worried.

1006
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:28,600
Okay.

1007
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:29,560
Yeah.

1008
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:36,601
I just wanted to say that I think that your discussion of the intentionality side of the house is really interesting.

1009
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:41,240
Another question is, this goes back to what the man in the lab said.

1010
01:14:41,481 --> 01:14:44,921
What is the explanation then of the video, of the intentionality?

1011
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,400
It's quite clear that you went to the story.

1012
01:14:48,761 --> 01:14:52,040
I'd say it again, because I think it's so important.

1013
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:55,240
I mean, there is no medium of it.

1014
01:14:55,240 --> 01:15:02,841
If that means anything that you could ever think or analyze, in my reading of Merlot Ponte, something happens.

1015
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:14,040
You know, I keep saying the physical energy comes in, and the perceptual system, which is just a more physical stuff, does its thing, and basins of attraction form in this piece of matter up here.

1016
01:15:14,441 --> 01:15:15,721
We don't know anything about that.

1017
01:15:15,721 --> 01:15:18,120
We've got theories, but they're all pretty pathetic.

1018
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:23,120
And we've got an experience of houses from the front.

1019
01:15:22,761 --> 01:15:29,681
How it's a it's it's a falling into an intellectualist trap to think that they have to be out of their intellect.

1020
01:15:30,481 --> 01:15:34,000
When you say a sentence to the sentence refers to the world, right?

1021
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,320
I can appreciate the significance of sentences.

1022
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:40,400
It's intentionality with those beyond yourself because I understand the language.

1023
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:47,761
Now, when I look at the cell in the house, I experiencing it, I experienced it according to you, has referred beyond itself to the back of the house.

1024
01:15:47,761 --> 01:15:49,520
Is that because I understand the language?

1025
01:15:49,521 --> 01:15:49,921
No.

1026
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:53,280
Maybe it's because I understand if I look at the back of the house, I was here.

1027
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,080
Yes, maybe.

1028
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:56,721
See, Alva, it's great to have Alva.

1029
01:15:56,721 --> 01:16:00,881
He's the perfect example of what happens if you translate this into something intellectual.

1030
01:16:00,881 --> 01:16:02,160
That is made.

1031
01:16:02,561 --> 01:16:10,960
It could be that I understand something like a rule that for houses they have backs and if you go around, you'll find them.

1032
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,480
And you can do that.

1033
01:16:12,481 --> 01:16:14,160
You can turn it into a belief.

1034
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:15,921
You can turn it into something you understand.

1035
01:16:15,921 --> 01:16:20,960
But Merloponte at least thinks that basically you don't do that.

1036
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:24,801
The body schema does it outside of consciousness and you don't do it.

1037
01:16:24,801 --> 01:16:25,921
Remember, one does it.

1038
01:16:25,921 --> 01:16:27,680
That's in our reading for this time.

1039
01:16:28,881 --> 01:16:31,680
The perceptual system does it.

1040
01:16:31,681 --> 01:16:36,320
And you can't ask, this is a Gibson light point, how the perceptual system does it.

1041
01:16:36,641 --> 01:16:38,000
It just does it.

1042
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,080
And what you get is this world.

1043
01:16:40,881 --> 01:16:44,080
The burden of proof is, I don't know who has the burden of proof.

1044
01:16:44,561 --> 01:16:51,440
Either Alva has the burden of proof to say why we need evangelist explanation, or I have the burden of proof to say why we don't.

1045
01:16:51,601 --> 01:16:52,881
Here's what makes it public.

1046
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,801
You say it happened outside of consciousness, right?

1047
01:16:54,881 --> 01:16:58,480
But what's not outside of consciousness is the anticipation.

1048
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,960
Is that there are conditions of satisfaction?

1049
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:01,601
That's right.

1050
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:05,120
The object has conditions of satisfaction.

1051
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:09,921
That is, it looks a certain way and it might not turn out to be that way.

1052
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:26,841
But whether it looks that way because of any sort of mental operations, which might be, you know, we have a concept of house which tells us that there's a whole lot of things about what we could do and what we could see and synthesizes all that.

1053
01:17:26,841 --> 01:17:27,960
That would be the incentive.

1054
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:31,080
It's not the object's conditions of satisfaction that don't matter.

1055
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:33,560
Objects are neutral.

1056
01:17:33,561 --> 01:17:35,640
It's the experience of the object.

1057
01:17:35,641 --> 01:17:41,640
I experience the whole house despite only having immediate access to the front of the house.

1058
01:17:41,641 --> 01:17:50,520
So there's got to be some story about the way in which the beard of the house is present in my experience when it's hitted by the front of the house.

1059
01:17:50,521 --> 01:17:50,761
Yes.

1060
01:17:50,761 --> 01:17:52,280
And you can't just say the brain does it.

1061
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:52,761
Why not?

1062
01:17:52,761 --> 01:17:56,921
Well, because that's not explaining how it seems present.

1063
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:59,400
There's a phenomenal life that seems present.

1064
01:17:59,561 --> 01:18:01,320
That's right, but that's bigger bulk.

1065
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:07,240
The code word for this, we have to both agree in there, Lafante, is the body scheme adjustment, right?

1066
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:09,641
And now then we're trying to figure out what that means.

1067
01:18:09,881 --> 01:18:12,200
The body schema is precisely not really crazy.

1068
01:18:12,601 --> 01:18:19,801
But yes, this is precisely not judgment and it's representation in one sense but not another.

1069
01:18:19,801 --> 01:18:22,120
And it's intentionality in one sense but not another.

1070
01:18:22,761 --> 01:18:31,000
But the objection varies that when you've done you've taken the notion of intentionality and just by Kaga subtracted judgment and those kind of activities.

1071
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:35,160
But what you've done is just taken out the explanatory framework.

1072
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:35,641
Yes.

1073
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:44,120
The moral of today's lecture we have to stop is don't ask for a mentalistic explanatory framework.

1074
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:51,761
It's a trap that's been around since um well, no, you can well I'll keep intentionality.

1075
01:18:51,921 --> 01:18:57,761
