1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,040
When you find two different meanings of intentionality and of representation and a constitution, and you can't tell who's speaking and things are looking pretty bad for ever understanding the book, keep your eye on the phenomenon.

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,800
That's what you should be doing.

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,480
Looking for those places, which is what I'm going to talk about today, where he actually describes something.

4
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:30,639
And from his point of view, and the Gestalt point of view, tells what, you know, draws all kinds of philosophical conclusions.

5
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:37,999
And then you'll understand why he has his own notion of intentionality and representation and constitution.

6
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,519
I don't remember whether any others in the air at that point.

7
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:42,959
I can't think of any.

8
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,719
But so that's the general moral.

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:01:03,919
Now, one thing that wasn't clear last time, which I would have gone back to, but one, it came up in an email that somebody sent me, and it happens to come up in just in a word at the very end of our reading.

10
00:01:03,919 --> 00:01:08,079
And that is an excuse and why he would say something like that.

11
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:33,960
This whole issue about temporality at the end is very relevant to the weird discussion, which may seem weird to you, it seemed perfectly okay to me, about conditions of satisfaction for the two different kinds of intentionality that are involved in Merlot-Ponty and in analytic philosophers like Searle.

12
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:45,639
And remember, I said, I still think it's true, that the final test of intentionality has to be whether there are, and I said conditions of satisfaction.

13
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:56,280
That might be the wrong way to say it, because that way of talking is sort of owned by the Searle side of this, which isn't wrong.

14
00:01:56,279 --> 00:01:59,240
I mean, beliefs have conditions of satisfaction.

15
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:06,440
That is, if you believe something, then the world is like that, then your belief is true and you're satisfied.

16
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,560
And if the world isn't like that, then your belief turns out not to be true.

17
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,000
And it doesn't.

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:22,040
But the way something is seen and has intentionality is it's got to imply something which could turn out to be false.

19
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:35,319
It can't, I mean, that's how you can tell that it's about something, that it has some kind of, I won't go on and say meaning, because again, I think that belongs to the traditional intentionality.

20
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,000
So it has some kind of sense or some kind of significance.

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,400
What is it to have some kind of sense or significance?

22
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:47,639
Well, it's to somehow imply something which could turn out not to be that way.

23
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:59,079
And that's why I brought in Gerbich's talk about perceptual implications and how the front of the house implies the back, looks like there's a back.

24
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:07,399
And in that sense, is in a weird way of putting it, going to be about the back, or implies it better, implies the back.

25
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:31,359
And now comes the part that gave people a hard time, I could see in this office hours and email, that that must mean that when the front looks like it's hiding the back, covering up the back, there is a back present already, then it turns out that there's no back.

26
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:33,040
There's a puzzle.

27
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,719
How can that be?

28
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:47,519
It doesn't bother people that when they believe some proposition like it's a beautiful sunny day, or let's say they believe it's a terrible rainy day, it can turn out to be false.

29
00:03:47,519 --> 00:04:14,559
But why does it, I don't quite know, well, I sort of, why it bothers you to think, you want to think, well, either there's a front of the house and it looks the way it does because it hides the back of the house, and then how could it turn out to be false when you go around and look and discover it's a facade, or there's a front of the house and it remains open whether there's really a back.

30
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,799
And then we get all that weird talk about neutrality and ambiguity, which we were in just at the end last time.

31
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,560
That's not going to work either.

32
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,519
It isn't as if the front of the house looks like maybe there's a back and maybe there's not a back.

33
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,760
It looks like there's a back.

34
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:38,639
Of course, it's indeterminate and ambiguous in the way everything in perception is never finished.

35
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:48,799
But there's something special about the way the front of the house perceptually implies the back, and there may or there may not be a back.

36
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:58,240
Now, the first thing to say is when you're involved in coping with it and not standing back and thinking about it, it actually looks like there's a back there.

37
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:04,599
I mean, once you step back and start to think about it and reflect on it, and he's talking about that too there during the end.

38
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:13,639
How if you reflect, he says at the bottom 276, I don't want to read it right now, you think there's some kind of data there that needs to be interpreted.

39
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:16,760
That would be like the sense datum of the front of the house.

40
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,880
You can interpret it as the sense datum of the front of a house or the sense datum of a facade.

41
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,120
But that's not the way it looks if you're involved.

42
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:33,480
That's the way it looks if you're past and say, well, maybe there's really a back and maybe there isn't and I'm not going to take any stand on it.

43
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:39,320
And then there's going to be some neutral something there, but not a normal perception.

44
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,240
Okay, but I'm leading up to the problem.

45
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:43,240
It really you are involved.

46
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:47,160
It looks like there's a back, and then you go around and there isn't.

47
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:49,800
How are you supposed to understand that?

48
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,719
Well, that's where this temporality discussion comes in.

49
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,200
That is what he said.

50
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:06,760
He says, in effect, that whenever you perceive anything, you're already committed to a future way it's going to develop.

51
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:10,599
It has inexhaustible richness or thickness.

52
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:13,799
Those are his two favorite terms for it.

53
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,400
That means it already looks, let's say, like a house with a back.

54
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:27,880
And when you find out it isn't, then your whole temporal stream of experience gets disrupted.

55
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,959
That's what we were talking about before.

56
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:36,760
And I said in a hurry that your expectations explode, but I didn't explain what that meant.

57
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:53,519
That means that if you were set to see the back of the house, but then to make it dramatic, you go around from the front, and instead of it being a facade, or instead of being the back of a house, there's a big swimming pool there or a waterfall, something crazy.

58
00:06:47,880 --> 00:07:03,680
Well, then all your bodily expectations, the sort of perceptual grip you had on what was going on, is undermined.

59
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,480
And for a minute, you just don't know what's going on.

60
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,200
That's when it explodes.

61
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:17,039
And then you get some new understanding of it, and you see that it's always been a kind of facade in front of a swimming pool.

62
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:25,120
And then we said, and this is important: you can't go back anymore and remember even how it was.

63
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,519
That's the sort of weird way the temporality can be retroactive or in this perceptual level.

64
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:39,360
I mean, it restructures your memory of the experience, if it's radical enough.

65
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,000
You can't anymore picture.

66
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,719
Remember, we did it the last time we were saying with the back of the man or the woman.

67
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:51,280
It's not that you see a bat which you interpret as a man or a woman.

68
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,880
That wouldn't explode.

69
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,959
That would just turn out to be wrong.

70
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:59,279
That would be turning it into this other kind of conditions of satisfaction.

71
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:05,440
Well, there's a bat, and I interpret it to be the back of a man, and therefore I expect it to be the back of a man.

72
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,079
This is all perfectly normal, non-Marilopanti intentionality.

73
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:20,960
So I have the belief that if I went around, I would see a face of a man, and I had the expectation, all that has propositional content, and all that to be falsified.

74
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:27,520
But if there was a neutral something that you experienced, then there wouldn't be any explosion, so to speak.

75
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,839
No big deal changing your perception.

76
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,840
You just change your belief.

77
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:45,800
Instead of seeing this back as being, having, if you went around it, the possibility of seeing a woman from the front, that interpretation would turn out to be right.

78
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,200
The other interpretation, I mean, a man.

79
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,880
Anyway, one of the interpretations would turn out to be wrong, which is always right, and vice versa.

80
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:56,040
And the back would go on looking the same.

81
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,160
There wouldn't be this kind of explosion.

82
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:09,320
Every synthesis is both, every synthesis is both exploded and rebuilt by time with one and the same process.

83
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,079
That's what I'm trying to explain.

84
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:21,000
So with some time, your house or your girl thing, or man thing experience, can be exploded as time passes.

85
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:23,640
And what is it to say rebuilt with time?

86
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:35,079
Well, it's to say you find you now, that's what I meant, you retroactively remember it differently and you are set to deal with it differently and it looks different.

87
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:41,960
Now the next thing that puzzled people was that I have to say something about, oh, I forgot this thing.

88
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,520
Just a second for this, the next coin.

89
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,839
Oh yeah, sure.

90
00:09:49,560 --> 00:10:01,720
That it somehow bothered people to think, well then what really is there is, say, a man in the Telegraph Avenue, or what really is there is a facade.

91
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:03,640
And how do we know that?

92
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,280
And is that about the sort of objective world?

93
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,760
And Hansen, where are we describing the objective world about what's really there?

94
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,920
Well, that is a complete mix-up.

95
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,280
And I therefore had to come in and talk about it.

96
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,840
Of course, I could see why somebody thinks that.

97
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,959
That's in a way, so don't panic, that crypto mechanism.

98
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:35,520
Whatever you think is the way, whatever you're experiencing it as right now looks like the way it really is, and it looks like it's because it's a man that is causing you to have an experience of a man, and that's that.

99
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,760
But you've got to stay on the level of perception here.

100
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:47,120
So when it turns out that you go around and it's a man, that's just another experience.

101
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,999
Not the objective final fact.

102
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,440
So it could turn out that it wasn't a man after all.

103
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:07,040
It's a girl wearing a beard and a mustache to fool people, or because she has the job of acting like that one pharaoh in each of them had a beard because pharaohs were all men because we wore a beard.

104
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:14,720
And there's always endless possibilities of new explosions and new taking back.

105
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:19,360
There isn't a right answer which undermines and settles it.

106
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,079
I must have caused that, or the crypto mechanism caused that.

107
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:32,000
You've got to think, well, yes, the experience you dropped behind what looked like a girl and it looks like a man.

108
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:38,320
And the next time you go around, you may have to retroactively, that may explode and you may have to retroactively fix that.

109
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,759
And it's all temporal.

110
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:41,760
And you never come to the end of it.

111
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:44,719
And everything is retroactively changeable.

112
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:47,360
I mean, if it gets bad enough, you go crazy.

113
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,160
I mean, you do it.

114
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:56,160
Up to a certain point, lots of surprises as to what you were taken for granted in your perception turn out not to be so.

115
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,640
And uh that's it.

116
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,040
That's what I wanted to tell to say.

117
00:12:01,359 --> 00:12:12,360
That's all meant to clearify very sensible because I could be followed for my trying to cover any comments, but that's important to understand that.

118
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:17,240
Uh I can tell you another version of it in a minute, but just which I just can remember.

119
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:31,160
Let's hear well, I mean, what I don't understand is this if your experience if you remember, if you don't remember how it was once you're experiencing the new way, then how can you, you know, how can committees ever, you know, go back to the beginning?

120
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:37,880
Well, I don't think I think partly your question is based on a false claim.

121
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:41,720
If you can't remember how it was, that's ambiguous.

122
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:50,760
You can certainly remember if your office was the back of a girl and you were very eager to go around and see what kind of a nice girl this might be.

123
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,520
You can remember all that.

124
00:12:52,520 --> 00:13:06,839
What you can't and what you can't remember when you drop behind again is how the in the world you ever got fooled by this back as if it were the back of a beautiful girl because it looks perfectly evidently like the back of a man.

125
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:09,479
That's that you you can't picture that.

126
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:11,160
But you remember that you were fooled.

127
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:11,880
Does that help?

128
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,679
I mean it did I think that you were getting off on a bad track.

129
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,320
Okay, I guess the conditions would be nice to have a nice word for this.

130
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,119
The conditions are we're trying to figure it out.

131
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:33,160
What we want to know is what you call the that which can satisfy your expectations or your anticipations would be better.

132
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,560
The reason I make that distinction is expectations is propositional.

133
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,839
I expect that it's going to look like a girl.

134
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:48,200
That's already in the detached, reflective, traditional intentionality mode.

135
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,359
Anticipation is my whole, then there won't be any explosion, remember.

136
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:55,119
You just, your expectation was wrong.

137
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:56,800
You've got a new expectation.

138
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:13,759
But if it was an anticipation, which is some, if your whole body was set to focus on and see a woman and you see a man, then your expectations are, I mean, your anticipations are upset.

139
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,919
You can't, you don't, you can, you could say I anticipated, you could add it was.

140
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,280
You could just use the word anticipated as if it meant expected, but you need a distinction.

141
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:33,360
One of them is an intellectual thing, a propositional idea, something mental that you believe or expected.

142
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:52,880
And the other one is supposed to be an embodied thing, an embodied way of being, some way you were set to see, already ready, and that was being motivated, is the funny word from Merlot Ponte, by what you're seeing already.

143
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,959
So that what you're seeing already is leading you to anticipate that.

144
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:03,120
I mean, keep asking yourself, what would it have to be for it to be able to retroactively explode?

145
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:11,040
It has to be more than an interpretation, more than a belief, more than an expectation, or maybe different than, I mean, different than.

146
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:18,880
It has to be some way that you're already coping with the future now.

147
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:25,280
So that when the future turns out to be not the way you were already coping with it, there's real breakdown.

148
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,840
And now we're trying to find a word for that.

149
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,560
Conditions of improvement is wrong.

150
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:34,040
I use that term in a different context where it makes sense.

151
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:35,480
It doesn't help here.

152
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:38,280
Conditions of satisfaction.

153
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:42,839
Your perceptual implications are not what?

154
00:15:43,479 --> 00:15:44,520
Fulfilled.

155
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:46,839
Fulfilled is just what I came across.

156
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,599
It's fulfilled, isn't it?

157
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:49,239
It's funny.

158
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,920
I came across it the minute you did it.

159
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:52,200
I'll be telepathic.

160
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,680
Yes.

161
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,160
Okay.

162
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,959
Yes, let's talk about conditions of fulfillment.

163
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:57,800
It's just another word.

164
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:03,959
But I'm afraid it's not going to, we're not going to have any.

165
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:06,920
Satisfaction is a technical term.

166
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:19,720
Normally, if you were to philosophy student to tell you that your belief that it's a sunny day today is satisfied, it would sound very odd to you if your belief is true.

167
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:26,120
Let me remind you, those of you who are, I tell you, conditions of satisfaction is a technical term.

168
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:31,560
It's supposed to cover your desire being, what, fulfilled maybe.

169
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,359
Your belief being true.

170
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:43,799
Your memory being, we need a new word for that one, accurate, and so forth.

171
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:49,479
All of those are species or species of conditions of satisfaction.

172
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:54,440
Something you, some, and your expectations, they get whatever.

173
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:59,000
They get fulfilled, unfortunately, but when you just don't have enough words to go around.

174
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:02,920
Or maybe your expectations actually get satisfied.

175
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:04,999
Your desires get satisfied.

176
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:14,519
You take some normal word and you stretch it to cover mental states which it wasn't meant to cover.

177
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:18,959
And you just need that because what they all have is blah, blah, blah conditions.

178
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:26,079
You've got to have a word in there, which means something that if it's there, it makes it correct.

179
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,239
And if it's not there, it will correct you.

180
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,440
See, you don't have any words for that.

181
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,239
Desires don't get to be correct when they get to be fulfilled.

182
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:34,079
They just get to be fulfilled.

183
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:49,839
There's this general notion that there's something that outstanding that hasn't been found out yet or happened yet, which is going to affect the truth of, or whatever.

184
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,440
Well, I don't know how anybody ever talks about this.

185
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,240
Maybe they don't.

186
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:59,519
I mean, everybody just talks about conditions of satisfaction as if they knew what they were talking about.

187
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:02,319
And there's nothing, the phenomenon is okay.

188
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:06,319
It's just that there is no neutral words for it.

189
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,239
You've got to make up technical terms.

190
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:10,239
Now we've got a new problem.

191
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:18,559
Here is this technical term, conditions of satisfaction, which covers memories, desires, beliefs, expectations, what else?

192
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:19,839
I don't know.

193
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:22,160
Perception.

194
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,759
Well, for Searle, yeah, oh, sure, an action.

195
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:28,160
Probably called perception or illusion?

196
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,599
Yeah, yeah, I'll be the idea.

197
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,759
Yeah, that's right, but we should put that in.

198
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:39,279
For Searle, and it's not wrong, perception itself has these kinds of conditions of satisfaction.

199
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:58,559
If I think I see, to take this early example, a yellow volgo outside the window, that's going to, either there is, and it turns out that my perception is veridical, that's just a version of true, or it turns out there isn't, and my perception is an illusion, it's not satisfied.

200
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:10,359
That the propositional content of my visual experience, that there's a yellow volume outside the window causing me to have this visual experience to talk like so, is not satisfied because there isn't one.

201
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,560
Or it is satisfied when there is one, and so forth.

202
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:15,879
This is just all background.

203
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,599
Now, what we want is just to find a word for this.

204
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:28,360
But it's not, well, I guess I'm inclined to say we just have to take over the word satisfied as a technical term and say this is another form of it.

205
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,880
I can't think of anything else to do.

206
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:50,279
But it's a different kind of satisfaction because all these other kinds of satisfactions, you can state as a proposition what it is that you seem to be seeing, what you believe, what you expect, what you desire, and this, you can't, you can do that too.

207
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:53,559
You can state the proposition, it's a lovely girl.

208
00:19:53,719 --> 00:20:02,039
But there, you've got to keep reminding yourself that this one can explode and the other one can't.

209
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,640
And that's what I'm trying to get at.

210
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:13,400
You're committing the future in a way right now at this perceptual level, that you're not at this mental level.

211
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,239
Okay, does that help any, Eric?

212
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,319
It's not the importance of this feeling.

213
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,040
That's right.

214
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,200
The anticipations break down.

215
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,639
Breakdown's a good word.

216
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,640
You don't think of beliefs breaking down.

217
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,519
That helps.

218
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:28,600
I mean, our desire, none of these other things.

219
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,040
Desires don't break down.

220
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:39,319
What breaks down is your anticipation, your body set, you're already in the future, the way your hand is already at the doorknob.

221
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:45,239
And when that is what explodes and gets undermined, gets breakdown.

222
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,119
Yeah.

223
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:56,559
I think it's exactly the right way to think about it, because it seems like what distinguishes Merloponte from some of my circles is that our bodies that are anticipations get disrupted or broken disrupted.

224
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,360
That would be good.

225
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:03,279
Yeah, and the notions of correctness and satisfaction should be left to the level of judgment or thought.

226
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,160
That's right.

227
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,200
That's right.

228
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,359
Okay, maybe the moral of all this, yeah, comes back in the grip.

229
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,959
Ah, that would be the state you would be in.

230
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,399
I could be what you're saying.

231
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:24,239
Funny, I want to say, yeah, that's very exactly right, and yet it is, but I mean, it's not wrong.

232
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:28,400
It's exactly what Merloponte is saying, so it can't be wrong.

233
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,880
But it's saying more than is involved in just the notion of set and breakdown.

234
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:42,559
It's a Merlot-Pontean thesis that we're always trying to get a maximal grip and heading toward equilibrium.

235
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,959
And when we fail, then we have this breakdown, explosion.

236
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:54,400
But you could tell the explosion story without the equilibrium story in just this more minimal story.

237
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:07,119
We're already taking a stand now on something that we are, and the way we're doing things now is already affected by what is there in the future for us.

238
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,999
And when it's not there, there's a breakdown.

239
00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:18,160
And adding equilibrium and maximal grip is not necessary for the more minimal story.

240
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:27,279
Cuthro, for instance, has a breakdown explosion story, and said at one point, but he never has the equilibrium.

241
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,160
Okay.

242
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:41,800
At one point, I was going to say one more thing about this, which I intended to say somewhere, because Husserl, Meryl Punch, he mentions, I'll jump to it, hyletic data on 248.

243
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:44,680
And this is relevant to Husserl and highletic data.

244
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:48,759
Because I wouldn't bother to explain hyletic data.

245
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,160
That just say ignore it as Husserl.

246
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,040
But we need it.

247
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:53,639
Uh-oh, but I think I've got the wrong.

248
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,440
Here it is, the bottom of your 248.

249
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,440
And it's all typical Husserl.

250
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:02,039
Oh, but I was drawing a conclusion.

251
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,799
I'm trying to say too many things at once.

252
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:09,560
The moral of this, I'm putting the conclusion in the middle of it now, is keep your eye on the phenomenon.

253
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:14,599
All that crazy struggling with the word satisfaction.

254
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:25,239
You don't get lost if you just remember the person on Telegraph Avenue or the house or something, and then all this talk about anticipations, explosions, and so forth.

255
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:26,839
You can get a grip on it.

256
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:36,600
So here's another one where he's talking about how I'm dealing with something, probing it with my eye, the bottom of 248, and it's beckoning.

257
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,519
There's this vague beckoning for my body to synchronize with it.

258
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:46,440
Now that is equilibrium talk and maximum grip talk.

259
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:52,920
It's trying to get us to get an optimally rich, stable grip on it.

260
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,320
It's like the masts and the trees as usual.

261
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:56,759
They were vaguely beckoning.

262
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,239
They were more like a storm that was threatening.

263
00:23:59,239 --> 00:24:00,359
It's all in the metaphors.

264
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,240
There was a tension.

265
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,920
Let's try to find something like that.

266
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,719
Attention drawing me to resolve it.

267
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:10,999
And when I do, then my body solves it.

268
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:12,519
This is a color one.

269
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:19,440
A sort of spasm which stops as soon as we adopt the bodily attitude corresponding to blue.

270
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:23,120
Well, these people are mentally deranged or injured.

271
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,400
So they're sort of exaggerated forms of this.

272
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:50,320
You can find it in your own experience, but maybe not getting the right color, but my favorite experience, which you've all had in some version or other, is, and it's got to find, oh, and highlighted data refers to the matter that's there, that's unstructured that's calling you to find the right structure to understand it.

273
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:57,119
And MeroPonchi somewhere says, I don't think we've read it yet, you have to find the key to unlock the phenomena.

274
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,400
That means you have to get the body set that's in sync.

275
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,840
And he does say in this very reading, though, I couldn't turn to it, that you get this, I think I care in a minute.

276
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:10,079
You have to get in sync with the object that's there.

277
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:16,080
Of course, the object isn't there until you get in sync with it, because that's what brings out the object that's there.

278
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,799
And on the perceptual level, it's one of these circular things.

279
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,119
But let me give you the phenomenon, and I'll show you where he talks about it.

280
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:35,519
My version of this is when you are thinking that you're going to get some milk, and you're eating, and you're talking, and you take up something and you swallow it, and it's not milk.

281
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:36,880
Let's say it's wine.

282
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,039
Now, you go into shock.

283
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,800
You have this sort of in your mouth.

284
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,759
It isn't as if you suddenly realize, oh, I thought it was going to be milk, and it's wine.

285
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,119
You don't know what it is.

286
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,759
It isn't milk anymore, and it isn't wine yet.

287
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:56,799
And then you get the right set, you get the right body relationship, what does he put it there?

288
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,840
You get the right bodily attitude, and it tastes like wine, and then it's okay.

289
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,599
But it's completely yucky as though you get your head.

290
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:07,799
And then it's highlighted data.

291
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:14,440
It's calling, beckoning for you to get the right attitude to understand it.

292
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,399
And I'll go to that.

293
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:22,200
I wasn't going to explain it in this order, but I think I can find the place that he talks about this funny thing.

294
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:28,360
And of course, you want to say, and we're back to this again, well, it was wine all along, and you finally found out you should never have thought it was milk.

295
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,400
And that's right.

296
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,959
But it isn't wine all along from a finished objective point of view.

297
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:41,320
It could turn out that after a little bit of wine, it goes back into a yucky experience, and it turns out it was really water.

298
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:47,879
I mean, you don't want to stand outside in a detached attitude when you're describing this experience.

299
00:26:48,279 --> 00:27:03,479
But just insofar as you think it's wine and it works for the while that it works, then it works probably for the rest of it here, the temporality that this experience is in, it's wine.

300
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:04,840
It turns out to be wine.

301
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,360
And you don't want to deny that.

302
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,519
Don't 278.

303
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:13,320
And this is just the way the perception works, about 15 lines from the bottom.

304
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:17,479
The act of looking is indivisibly prospective.

305
00:27:17,479 --> 00:27:18,519
We've been going through all this.

306
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:20,040
This is really the phenomenon.

307
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:30,759
Since the object is the final stage of my process of focusing, and retrospective, since it will present itself as perceiving its own appearance, you recognize what we just said.

308
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:35,000
The wine presents itself as perceiving its own experience.

309
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,039
It it presents itself as it was lying all along, you idiot.

310
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,039
How did you manage to think that you're going to make it taste like milk?

311
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:49,600
And when you and it's inevitable that when you get that, that's what it looked like when the man on the telegram Avenue, well, it was a man all along.

312
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,079
Why in the world would you think otherwise?

313
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,999
But until you get that, you're just in this vague, unstable state.

314
00:27:57,999 --> 00:28:03,759
And after you get that, you've retroactively decided, well, that was that all along.

315
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:06,079
And that's how experience works.

316
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,400
And it isn't false.

317
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,840
It's just that it's you've got to realize that it's never settled.

318
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,440
It's in this temporal screen.

319
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,920
It could be retroactively taken back.

320
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,359
It's not from nowhere that you can declare that.

321
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,440
That was a very important concern.

322
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,400
Okay, now I said everything I want to say about that.

323
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:29,039
I'm ready to go on to where I've been supposed to be explaining this chapter.

324
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,080
But sooner or later, I think that's all very important to say.

325
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:38,559
What's most important about Narofunchi is sort of always, always there, but never, hardly ever came at once.

326
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,120
And that's this whole story you just want to say.

327
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:49,680
This comes up every once in a while in a sentence here, an explosion there, but you never get it told the way I just told it, anywhere, I think.

328
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,160
Yeah.

329
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,039
Well, I want to ask you.

330
00:28:51,279 --> 00:29:00,959
No, no, I will either answer or I'm just confused because for historical loss of a possibility of everything drinking, because you could either be holistic, okay, no, I don't want to talk about that.

331
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,400
I'm talking about it.

332
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:05,999
That's too many details will get us back too much into it.

333
00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:07,599
Let's go on where we are.

334
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:10,079
I've got to see where I am.

335
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:16,639
Okay, we're now I'm just going to do for the rest of the time, unless somebody interrupts me again, which is fine.

336
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:22,280
But I want to lay out for, say, 20 minutes or so, what the chapter is about.

337
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:27,680
So, because today we're finishing it, and I therefore want to be sure we've finished it.

338
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,799
So, we're now in the second part of the book, part two of the book, The World is Perceived.

339
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,400
Maybe after office hours, I should make a quick parenthetical.

340
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:42,440
I didn't, how many of you, I can't resist this, it's so weird.

341
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,440
How many of you read the sexuality chapters and the language chapter?

342
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,920
The sexuality chapter, that's more likely that you think that might be interesting.

343
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,279
I thought it might be interesting.

344
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,200
And maybe it wasn't, or was it?

345
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:54,680
I don't know.

346
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,680
How many read the language chapter?

347
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:05,719
Okay, I'm wondering whether it's a new technique for teaching to tell people not to read chapters and out of just counter suggestiveness, they will do the assignment.

348
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:07,560
But I guess not quite.

349
00:30:07,719 --> 00:30:10,920
Anyway, I owe you a quick explanation.

350
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:15,719
I'm not going to tell you why I found them uninteresting, because it may be my fault.

351
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:23,239
But one thing is sure, that this is all I want to say, is in the order of the book, there's no reason for them to be where they are.

352
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:29,799
They're just an interruption in the story about two things that the book is about, perception and the body.

353
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:32,040
I mean, it isn't just about the fire.

354
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:40,279
I don't know why, and it might be about the body where after all you have to have a body in order to say things and make the noises that language is.

355
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:42,999
But that would be sort of a sidetrack.

356
00:30:42,999 --> 00:30:49,959
I mean, it's really about the perception of objects and how that is related to having a body.

357
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:53,799
That is, what it is to have a body and what it is to perceive an object.

358
00:30:53,799 --> 00:31:07,079
And so, for no reason that I can see, except you threw the pages up in the air and they came down this way, that all of a sudden, in the middle of the synthesis of the body, comes the sexuality chapter, comes the speech chapter.

359
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:13,799
I'm not, I mean, I'm ready to read them if I have time, if everybody had enough people insist that I would, to see if there's anything interesting in them.

360
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:26,239
But I'm not going to teach them because the theory of the body and perception comes back on your page 235, and you'd never notice if you didn't watch those other chapters if they hadn't been there.

361
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:32,319
And I'm just going to ignore them because they don't belong, and that's part of the argument, as far as I can see.

362
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:37,039
Now, so we're on to the world is perceived, which is a fine thing.

363
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:42,080
That they're really a threefold thing: self, object, and world.

364
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,319
Newton always wants to say that whenever you're talking about any one of those, you're talking about everything.

365
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,719
That's the whole system story.

366
00:31:48,719 --> 00:31:50,080
There's always a field.

367
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,120
There's always me being rolled in by the field.

368
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,879
There's always the object which is pulling me to get a grip on it.

369
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,440
And so here we are, back to the object.

370
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:08,239
And so we're going to talk about this correlative unity of the object and the lived body from 239.

371
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:20,959
Now I'm going to summarize what I think is important in the short little introduction to book two, where the theory, the body is a theory of perception.

372
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:22,399
I find that a very strange title.

373
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,000
He does say that in French, I suppose.

374
00:32:23,999 --> 00:32:25,839
It is the kind of thing you could miss.

375
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:31,440
I don't see that he has a theory of the body, and I don't think he believes that can be a theory of perception.

376
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,999
I guess theory must mean something different in French than it does to me in English.

377
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:40,000
If you change that to the account of the body, it's already an account of perception.

378
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,279
I feel all right about it.

379
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,440
Theory is something scientists have.

380
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,799
He doesn't have a theory of the body.

381
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:45,759
He doesn't want a theory.

382
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:47,519
Is that true?

383
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:49,520
French theory is much more general.

384
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,440
It's like that.

385
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,079
Okay.

386
00:32:52,080 --> 00:33:05,319
So you could think, I would change it in my head to the account of the body or to the account of perception, because it's very confusing if you're looking for a theory of the body and a theory of perception in the way that he doesn't just not have one.

387
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:13,559
Well, by theory, I mean an objective, detached, rule-like, or law-like description of some phenomenon.

388
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:25,479
That's exactly what the body schema, remember I said this last time, is just the name for the fact that we've got no theory at all about how the body does this.

389
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:27,160
It just does it.

390
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,079
Does this mean unify our experience?

391
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,440
And to have, yeah.

392
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:34,200
No, no, go ahead.

393
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,039
Well, I think that he shouldn't.

394
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:36,760
I mean, that's the point.

395
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,080
Well, the point is it's not objective thought, you know.

396
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:49,479
Right, but what if what could be what how could there be a theory of the body schema when in a certain sense there's nothing you can say about the body schema except sort of that it's what does, and then you describe the options.

397
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,479
I think wait, what you said is right.

398
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:58,680
It's not a theory in the sense of the traditional objective science, objective thought kind of scientific possible theory.

399
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,439
But you're just going to use the word theory.

400
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:00,919
Yeah, yeah.

401
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:02,120
Well, that's right.

402
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,599
And so I want to just say for worse, we're not disagreeing.

403
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,359
Clear your mind of it.

404
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:07,880
There's no theory here.

405
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:09,879
And that's fine.

406
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:26,280
A phenomenologist gets you an account or a description and has plenty to say without getting into the detached attitude of reflection and without telling you any sort of objective truth.

407
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:26,999
Yeah.

408
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:41,239
It misses the fact that there could be only one theory of dealing with the objects and perceived the end of the evening the same.

409
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:43,479
I see, I like that.

410
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:52,880
And that you could miss, if you have the objective approach, exactly, uh in which the theoretical objective approach, in which you miss the internation between the two?

411
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:53,919
Okay, maybe, maybe.

412
00:34:53,919 --> 00:35:00,480
I mean, and he's just saying, maybe this that that he's denying that he that there could be a theory of the body.

413
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,600
Because when you try to describe it, you've already got a theory of perception.

414
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:11,120
Now, if only he gave up the the talk of the theory of perception too, because I don't think he's got that either, uh then I think you'd be fine.

415
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,080
And people think the stalt theory, don't they?

416
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,120
Or do they?

417
00:35:15,439 --> 00:35:34,160
So, I mean, I guess w if you have an account uh which is uh I don't know explicit and intersubjectively shareable or something, you could claim you've already got a theory, particularly if you're in psychology and want to be scientific.

418
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:41,359
So the Nevstalt people say they've got a theory, though they've got no description.

419
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:41,839
That's right.

420
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,439
It's sort of organized description.

421
00:35:43,439 --> 00:35:48,080
If theory means organized description, then he's got a theory of perception.

422
00:35:48,080 --> 00:36:00,960
And maybe Olivier thinks, maybe the chapter title means that you couldn't have an organized account of the body except insofar as you saw it as correlative with an organized account of perception.

423
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,200
That's the best blank we can put on it.

424
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,719
What does Gibson call what he's got?

425
00:36:04,879 --> 00:36:05,439
Theory?

426
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:06,879
Isn't that nice?

427
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:09,599
Good, good, good.

428
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,439
I mean, that I that's what that's well that's that's even doubly nice.

429
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:18,640
He's doing science and yet he's not gonna claim he's this fancy physics too.

430
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,839
But okay.

431
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:21,920
Yeah, for the better.

432
00:36:21,919 --> 00:36:26,560
Okay, so I'm going to read you the line about the correlative now in 239.

433
00:36:27,279 --> 00:36:28,719
I'm halfway down.

434
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:41,000
Every external perception is immediately synonymous with a certain perception of my body, just as every perception of my body is made explicit in the language of external perception.

435
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,120
That's metaphor, of course.

436
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,120
He doesn't mean talk about it.

437
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:54,679
That the language of external perception is perceptual implication, like the front of the house saying, there's a bat behind me, without actually saying anything.

438
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,399
So it's made explicit in the language of external perception.

439
00:36:57,399 --> 00:37:08,840
If then, as we have seen to be the case, the body is not a transparent object, it is not presented to us in virtue of the law of its constitution, that would be really a theory, as the circle through the geometer.

440
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:17,640
If it is an expressive unity, which we can learn to know only by actively taking it up, this structure will be passed on to the visible world.

441
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:32,040
Well, that's about the correlation of it, but that also raises the first basic point I want to talk about, which I always think is very deep in Merloponte and very much comes up all the time, but hard to talk about.

442
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:36,040
And I don't know where, if anywhere, he talks about it head on.

443
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,360
But you want to ask sort of why?

444
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,920
The unity of the body, you can only get access to it by actively taking it up.

445
00:37:44,919 --> 00:37:47,719
Why can't you just describe it?

446
00:37:48,919 --> 00:37:55,000
And this is equivalent to saying you have to experience it.

447
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,879
There is nothing there but an experience.

448
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:05,320
Nothing to say about it, but to call attention to this experience.

449
00:38:05,879 --> 00:38:34,479
And that's tied up with what she was saying about if that really has in the background the notion of equilibrium and maximum grip and the sense of attention, not paying attention, that there is a tension, C-E-N-S-I-O-N, that this pull, this vague beckoning, that all the idea that it's something you can only live and feel that he's talking about.

450
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:45,120
There isn't anything else to say about it, except it feels like you're moving toward getting it right and getting a better grip, or it feels like you're moving toward getting it wrong and things are getting blurry.

451
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,520
And that's why.

452
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,759
It has to be actively taken up.

453
00:38:49,759 --> 00:38:57,200
As soon as you try to have a detached look about yourself and the object, it doesn't pull you anymore.

454
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,000
It isn't like a storm on the horizon anymore.

455
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,560
It isn't as if you feel that this direction is better and this direction is worse.

456
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:10,319
That's all only going to happen while you're involved actually in coping with it.

457
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:18,799
And then, and only then, you get the sense of the body as this kind of what he calls expressive unity.

458
00:39:18,799 --> 00:39:20,400
Why expressive?

459
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:26,880
Well, because every part, again, refers in this peculiar sense to all the rest.

460
00:39:26,879 --> 00:39:31,759
So what's going on with any part of your body has already taken account of it in the rest.

461
00:39:31,759 --> 00:39:33,759
Your balance is taking account of it.

462
00:39:33,759 --> 00:39:37,840
You can switch from doing something with one hand to doing something with another hand.

463
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:41,759
You can switch from paying attention to mainly how it looks, to how it sounds.

464
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:57,599
All of this, what he calls later, this intersensorial unity or the synergistic system is a unity in which how any part of it is experienced is already telling you about the rest of it.

465
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,519
It's another holism.

466
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,040
It's the same whole rhythm story.

467
00:40:02,919 --> 00:40:04,999
Okay, so why do we have to live it?

468
00:40:01,759 --> 00:40:07,239
Well, it's because I'm just skimming my own notes here.

469
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,879
It's always readiness to do something.

470
00:40:09,879 --> 00:40:18,280
You've got to you don't get the if you aren't in this readiness, if you aren't deared into the world, then you don't have this experience and you're missing the whole thing.

471
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:27,959
So this is the normative pull that he's talking about getting a of being towards and you've got to keep your eyes open for it.

472
00:40:28,279 --> 00:40:30,840
He says meant sometimes equilibrium.

473
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:33,079
He says sometimes maximum grip.

474
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:39,479
But here on 244, for instance, I found him saying something else, but they're all the same, about five lines down.

475
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:50,039
The motor significance of colors is comprehensible only if we need to be closed, only if these needs to be closed faith or indescribable qualities presented to an observing and thinking structure.

476
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,159
See, that's how you can't really understand them.

477
00:40:53,160 --> 00:41:00,440
And if they impinge within you on a certain general setting, then would I come to grips with the world?

478
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:02,600
Well, come to terms with the world.

479
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,560
I read it now.

480
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,919
Come to terms with the world.

481
00:41:04,919 --> 00:41:07,080
But it's the same as coming to grips with the world.

482
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,239
It's reaching an equilibrium again.

483
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:14,360
It's getting things as clear, as rich, as thick as possible.

484
00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:17,799
And sometimes he says somewhere, I don't know what it is.

485
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:24,120
Having generally your expectations fulfilled as you go along.

486
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,559
That's what you're trying to do.

487
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,759
That's what it is to come to terms with the world.

488
00:41:28,759 --> 00:41:35,880
That's what you have and that now that's that's all I want to say about that for a moment.

489
00:41:36,759 --> 00:41:41,560
And I want to say the opposite of this view within 243.

490
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,759
Okay, this is where I think I said already.

491
00:41:44,759 --> 00:41:48,320
Didn't I not, Merillo Plot Quantine, starting in the middle of 246?

492
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,160
Did I say that last time?

493
00:41:47,879 --> 00:41:51,519
Think I remember?

494
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,200
Well, I better say it now.

495
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:59,680
Starting from the middle of 246 through the top of 248, you're not in Merillopan Q.

496
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:00,719
We're in thought.

497
00:42:01,279 --> 00:42:02,639
I told you the clue.

498
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:09,200
You always know you're in SART as soon as you see in itself and for itself, which you see in italics at the top of 247.

499
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,120
I swear this is where we were last time.

500
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:11,439
Yes?

501
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,120
Well, I see your point.

502
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:29,440
What I guess what I'm trying to say is, that's a perfectly sensible point.

503
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:38,239
You could say you've got a readiness to see such and such, and then you get surprised or you don't get surprised.

504
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:41,040
What is it that you can't describe?

505
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:52,800
But suppose you just switched now, maybe we're not disagreeing, and you just became detached, then you wouldn't have any readiness anymore or any set.

506
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:56,719
So maybe the thing to say is not that you can't describe the body.

507
00:42:56,719 --> 00:42:58,480
I think you're making a good point.

508
00:42:58,799 --> 00:43:04,959
What I mean to say is you can't describe the body except from an involved active point.

509
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:17,920
But there isn't any readiness set, feeling attention, lowering attention and all that, if you're just being an observer of yourself and the object.

510
00:43:17,919 --> 00:43:30,879
So it's not that there's not something to describe, but there's a special fact, and this is sort of the existential phenomenologist story, that it's a kind of phenomenology that you can only do from being involved.

511
00:43:30,879 --> 00:43:35,880
Of course, this leads you to a very peculiar thing, how to do phenomenology while being involved.

512
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:37,880
He mentions it at the very end.

513
00:43:37,879 --> 00:43:42,759
He says we need a new radical kind of reflection, but he doesn't tell you how you're going to get it.

514
00:43:42,759 --> 00:43:46,520
At the very bottom of 280, you just raised this point.

515
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:50,680
As soon as you adopt a critical attitude and ask, what am I really seeing?

516
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,759
You're missing a phenomenon.

517
00:43:52,759 --> 00:43:57,560
The task of a radical reflection, that's normal reflection.

518
00:43:57,799 --> 00:44:01,719
There he's thinking of Witzero and Sartre in this paragraph.

519
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:03,319
This is sort of not him, too.

520
00:44:03,879 --> 00:44:07,719
Well, it's sort of him and sort of not him flipping back and forth.

521
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:11,639
But at the bottom, he's saying where he stands.

522
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:21,640
He says the task of a radical reflection, the kind of aims of self-comprehension, consists paradoxically in recovering the unreflected experience of the world.

523
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:34,520
And sometimes he calls that existence, because that always means being in the world, being involved, actually responding to the solicitations and tensions.

524
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,160
So that's it.

525
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,039
You're right.

526
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,639
You caused me to refine it.

527
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,839
There is plenty to describe.

528
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:40,759
That's what our phenomenology is doing.

529
00:44:40,759 --> 00:44:44,200
But you can't describe it from where anybody else has tried to describe it.

530
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:53,399
And I must say, I don't, I wouldn't, if you press me to say what in the world this particular kind of why will type stuff that is a challenge.

531
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,400
I think, well, how can you do this?

532
00:44:55,399 --> 00:45:02,999
How can you sit around and do phenomenology and try to reflect on all this, but stay involved in it?

533
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,879
That's a puzzle.

534
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,719
I'll tell you what I think about it in a second.

535
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,680
His point is very important, I think, because Can you hear him when he talks up here?

536
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,639
Can you hear him?

537
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:23,200
If you talk loud, or if I think it's important, but I think because maybe you can think of, and this is why you don't like to understand the the way you breathe the the preference way.

538
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:24,239
Don't bring up the speech.

539
00:45:31,279 --> 00:45:37,279
They seem to get screen here in three times and that the judgment only optionally expresses.

540
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,879
Wait, are you in the speech chapter?

541
00:45:38,879 --> 00:45:40,319
No, I mean the introduction.

542
00:45:40,799 --> 00:45:41,439
Only the introduction.

543
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:43,279
Oh, no, I don't want to talk about the introduction either.

544
00:45:43,279 --> 00:45:43,919
I'm sorry.

545
00:45:43,919 --> 00:45:45,519
You know, I don't like the introduction.

546
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,319
I have I mean I don't believe the introduction.

547
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,759
Then we talked about it.

548
00:45:49,759 --> 00:45:51,439
I think the significance.

549
00:45:52,799 --> 00:45:53,839
Not the first introduction.

550
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:54,959
Just one introduction.

551
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,120
Yes.

552
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:56,160
Oh, sorry.

553
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,399
I'm just making hands on what I just said.

554
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,680
Strike it correctly.

555
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,399
The introduction you mean to the sense experience.

556
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,079
What introduction?

557
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,959
Attention is the introduction to attention and judgment.

558
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,319
It's always not reading the preface.

559
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,999
Yeah, I told you not to read the preface.

560
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,239
Right.

561
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:11,840
Introduction is good stuff.

562
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:12,640
It's the preface.

563
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,600
Don't read the preface.

564
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,440
It will warp your mind.

565
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,120
Okay, go ahead.

566
00:46:17,439 --> 00:46:24,239
So, I mean, what uh what you said to think is that whenever you develop the attention, you're judging the task.

567
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:32,079
I'm just saying that you have to conceive the judgment as a mere expression of meaning as constituted by your engagement and coding in protocols.

568
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:40,320
Okay, but that doesn't solve my problem, which is what attitude are you in when you're getting yourself in getting the data for this kind of judgment.

569
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,840
Well, it's probably not helpful then, but if you tell me where, I'll read it.

570
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:53,359
But comprehension is different, but is that the same as radical reflection?

571
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:53,839
Yes.

572
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:54,399
It is.

573
00:46:54,879 --> 00:46:56,800
Does he think you've got it?

574
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,640
Or also got it?

575
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:00,599
He thinks he's got it.

576
00:47:00,879 --> 00:47:03,080
Well, she'll say let's talk about it.

577
00:47:02,879 --> 00:47:05,080
If it turns out to be helpful, I'll find it.

578
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:13,880
Everyone will have intellectual nights, but we're sure the phenomenon is difficult to distinguish itself from the testing of intellectual.

579
00:47:13,879 --> 00:47:17,800
Okay, which is really illegal measures.

580
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:20,439
So the difficulty.

581
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,759
Okay, well, I want to know sort of more.

582
00:47:22,759 --> 00:47:31,959
But all I want to say now is, and I don't have an answer to this, and if you tell me the pages of the introduction where he might be dealing with it, I'd love to see.

583
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,080
What I think he really does isn't that at all.

584
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:55,080
What radical, I mean, I just want to say, if you look at the book and say, well, how does he get us to see these things that he's talking about, which is always supposed to be how the world is when I'm involved coping and not reflecting on it, he's either getting us to remember it, and that's dangerous because then there's reflection.

585
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,040
And remember, reflection changes the phenomenon.

586
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:07,399
The famous example is Sartre's example, where he talks about I'm involved in counting some cigarettes and then I reflect on it and I think I'm counting the cigarettes.

587
00:48:07,399 --> 00:48:11,559
But there was no I there counting the cigarettes while I was involved in doing it.

588
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:17,719
That's just a very streamy, clear, typical Sartre So Clear kind of example.

589
00:48:17,719 --> 00:48:27,879
So you can't trust anything that you find in your experience on reflection and you certainly don't want to ever make the mistake of saying that it was there all along and you discovered it.

590
00:48:27,879 --> 00:48:30,040
You know, we did that in the attention tap.

591
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:32,999
He doesn't have what?

592
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,959
Well, no, he thinks it's radical reflection.

593
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:36,200
Right.

594
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:40,759
Well, first one, let's think normal reflection, certainly, he's clear about that.

595
00:48:40,759 --> 00:48:42,520
I don't think we disagree about that.

596
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,999
Changes the phenomenon and you can't trust it.

597
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,519
Let's just read that, so I'm not sure if you're making it up.

598
00:48:47,919 --> 00:48:48,560
Good to me.

599
00:48:47,399 --> 00:48:49,999
This is obvious in a way.

600
00:48:51,040 --> 00:49:02,799
I mean, he sounds sort of dark, like he's making the same point as Dart, agreeing in the start, that the reflective life at the bottom of 254 differs from the unreflective in having been phenotyped.

601
00:49:02,799 --> 00:49:07,520
And what is given is not consciousness of pure being.

602
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,079
Well, that's just a passing remark there.

603
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,160
But anyway, take my word for it.

604
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,280
And if you find anything that disagrees, I'd be surprised.

605
00:49:15,279 --> 00:49:17,839
Normal reflection changes the experience.

606
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:19,279
I don't think we disagree about that.

607
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:22,399
That's why we need radical reflection, whatever that is.

608
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,839
One and about the time.

609
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,039
This is what was written at the end of the introduction, so I think that this is the real reflection.

610
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,239
Now, which introduction?

611
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:35,519
The one I think is all right.

612
00:49:35,919 --> 00:49:36,319
Yes.

613
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,239
Okay, let me tell us where.

614
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,799
Okay, I'm at the end.

615
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,439
Reflection is really reflection only if it doesn't carry itself out of experience.

616
00:49:45,919 --> 00:49:50,640
And those are safe as reflection unreflected, which means that you don't quit.

617
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,279
You might not get out or reflect.

618
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,879
Don't get out, okay.

619
00:49:54,879 --> 00:49:57,439
And that's what he thinks we're doing.

620
00:49:57,439 --> 00:49:59,359
I see what we are, by the way, 270.

621
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,040
I'm sorry, 72.

622
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:03,280
Let me just read it and think about it.

623
00:50:03,439 --> 00:50:05,120
Reflection is truly reflection.

624
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,600
I don't know about that thing.

625
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,680
Boy, I'm not going to think about it now.

626
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,160
I think he's denying this.

627
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:23,280
True reflection knows that it's as reflection on an unreflected experience and consequently, as a change in structure of our existence.

628
00:50:23,279 --> 00:50:24,959
So, I don't know what's going on there.

629
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,680
And if you want to find out what the structure of our existence is, why would you want to change the structure of our existence?

630
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:43,560
We want to know the structure of our existence when we are as much as possible, I think, in flow, definitely, totally involved in culture.

631
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:54,919
No, but then, but then, as you think, and you can then think about thinking, but the phenomenology of perception is mostly not about thinking, it's about coping.

632
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:01,079
Yes, but and when you think, oh boy, I'm not going to talk about this anymore.

633
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,839
You see, I'm good, I see you're all phasing out.

634
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,319
But you could think about it on your own.

635
00:51:05,319 --> 00:51:13,400
The question is: you want to talk about the way things are when you're not thinking about them and reflecting on them, how you do it.

636
00:51:13,719 --> 00:51:15,719
And I think that's a problem.

637
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:18,839
But I'm ready to think about it and come back and give you the report.

638
00:51:18,839 --> 00:51:19,320
Yeah.

639
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,680
I'll talk about the language chapter.

640
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:23,879
I said language.

641
00:51:23,879 --> 00:51:26,759
It goes into thinking there are mental content.

642
00:51:26,759 --> 00:51:32,600
But what we're overlooking is that language, he says language is uncommunicative of anything other than itself.

643
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:36,359
And the word, the word doesn't stand for any sort of meaning.

644
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:37,719
The word is the meaning.

645
00:51:38,279 --> 00:51:42,519
You can say all that, but it just means it's just more words as far as I'm concerned.

646
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,239
Wait, no.

647
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,320
The problem remains.

648
00:51:45,319 --> 00:52:06,520
The problem remains: to what extent can you describe your absorbed coping experience when you're not reflecting and dealing with the objects in the perceptual world and not dealing with them as just objects you're standing back and looking at, but houses you're walking around and into.

649
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,759
How do you know how that looks and feels?

650
00:52:08,759 --> 00:52:09,799
Well, you can do it.

651
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,279
Yeah, you can do it because he does it.

652
00:52:14,279 --> 00:52:22,640
Now, how he does it, I think, is reminding you of experiences you've had, like I did with the highlighted data of the milk and the wine.

653
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:25,040
He does it by asking you to look at narrow quantity.

654
00:52:25,279 --> 00:52:25,999
I still recommend.

655
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,759
How many look at the doubt Cézanne Stout, read Cézanne Stout?

656
00:52:29,759 --> 00:52:41,759
Well, there you see him at his best doing it because he's saying, Well, I really can't see this, but I can see that Cézanne sees what it's like to perceive an object, and I'll describe how he did, how he says it.

657
00:52:41,759 --> 00:52:51,759
He looks at all these brain-injured people and tries to see what it's like to lack a certain capacity and thereby describes the capacity.

658
00:52:52,399 --> 00:53:07,920
He wouldn't need to go by way of Cézanne and Yellow Goldstein if he could just say, Let's describe what it's like to have a lived body in grip with and transparently coping with the world.

659
00:53:07,919 --> 00:53:18,160
I think that's very hard to see because immediately you're crafted to reflecting on it, and then the crypto mechanism says it was determined and it was there all along.

660
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,360
This is hard.

661
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:20,879
Anyway, I'm not going to go into it.

662
00:53:20,879 --> 00:53:21,839
I'll begin more.

663
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:23,359
I don't know why I didn't brought it up.

664
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:24,880
It's because I wrote it down here.

665
00:53:24,879 --> 00:53:26,639
Well, there's so many things I want to cover.

666
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,079
Not that we can't come back to it.

667
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:28,640
We will.

668
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:29,279
He will.

669
00:53:29,279 --> 00:53:31,440
Any issue that comes up will come back.

670
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:35,279
That's the story of this book.

671
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,880
And again and again.

672
00:53:37,279 --> 00:53:37,919
Let's see now.

673
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:38,319
Let's see.

674
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,160
So you get the experience with Norman at Paul of getting a grip.

675
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,360
I just said that.

676
00:53:43,759 --> 00:53:44,559
Where am I?

677
00:53:45,359 --> 00:54:02,759
And all I was saying, one view is it's opposed to, and that got us to a certain kind of reflection, surely, it is not is what it's opposed to, and where you stand back and take a as an observer of your self in your experience.

678
00:54:02,759 --> 00:54:06,600
And now 248.

679
00:54:02,399 --> 00:54:09,080
Ah, well, that's what I talked about earlier.

680
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:13,480
That's where we fell into the intentionality issue.

681
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:17,079
And I'm not going to come back to it for third time.

682
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,599
That's fine.

683
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,239
Okay.

684
00:54:19,239 --> 00:54:23,719
Now, now we're to the point of the chapter on sense experience finally.

685
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,880
What's going on here?

686
00:54:25,879 --> 00:54:39,879
Well, he's going to try to show the role of the body, even in our experience of color, where you think that you're just a sort of eyes looking at the colored thing.

687
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:50,280
Even when we're not coping with things by walking around them, the body is still involved, and it's still part of a holistic system.

688
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:55,719
And you've got to get in the right body stance to perceive colors.

689
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:58,359
This is just, he has to say this.

690
00:54:58,359 --> 00:54:59,719
I hope it's true.

691
00:55:00,919 --> 00:55:04,440
He's got a bunch of brain-injured people for it's true.

692
00:55:04,439 --> 00:55:09,959
And then he tries to get you to see that it's normally true.

693
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,959
Let me read it down to see where I am.

694
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,320
No, I don't need that.

695
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:21,319
Are there any of those who, the people on page 242 who have this disease of the cerebellum and so forth?

696
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:25,079
But what he's trying to show is what they're doing.

697
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,320
Now, back to 244.

698
00:55:27,319 --> 00:55:34,120
The colors, he says, various solids are being in the world.

699
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,439
That's about 15 lining me down.

700
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:52,400
And that has to do with the fact, therefore, it would follow that since my body is my basic way of coping and dealing with the world, there ought to be a close correlation between what colors I see and how my body's stance or attitude is.

701
00:55:52,719 --> 00:56:01,040
And then he has, first he has these people who are sort of weird and who get into whole different positions in order to see red or blue.

702
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,560
We're not like that.

703
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:14,960
Then he gets to the artists who are typical of them, which he likes, who are more density to these color things than we are, and who say things that he thinks are so, like middle, 2.4.

704
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,759
Green is commonly regarded as a restful color.

705
00:56:17,759 --> 00:56:22,960
It encloses me within myself and brings a peaceful state, says one patient.

706
00:56:23,439 --> 00:56:25,359
But then we get an artist.

707
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:31,360
They make no demands on us and they don't even join us to do anything, says Kendinski, and so forth.

708
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:34,000
I think he has got a case.

709
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,599
Someone said it to me, and I thought it was a nice way to put it.

710
00:56:37,919 --> 00:56:55,680
It's not, you don't have to have problems with the cerebellums to realize that if you want to give a party, you want to have red and rosy light as a party, because people generally are in a more open frame of mind and they stand more openly and everybody just feels close to everybody.

711
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:05,600
Well, you certainly don't want to do it with yellow light or green light as your party, unless you're a goth or something and want to create some very special mood.

712
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:09,039
But even that makes the same point.

713
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:13,519
I mean, if you want to create a special spooky mood, you can use spooky lights.

714
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:20,640
And how do lights create these moods and get you to relate to other people and stand and so forth in some way?

715
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:25,120
Well, it's because your body is tuned to the color.

716
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:28,000
And that's what he wants you to realize.

717
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,239
And so he says it, and it seems light.

718
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,680
So he has painters on his side.

719
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:39,399
Now, 246 to 248 is not now upon TV.

720
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,080
I don't get whether I said that.

721
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,680
Oh, I just said it a minute ago.

722
00:57:42,839 --> 00:57:43,639
Didn't I?

723
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:44,839
Okay, good.

724
00:57:44,839 --> 00:57:48,120
So now, okay, I'm catching up with where I am.

725
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,479
Oh, here's a new one.

726
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,479
We've got to do this one.

727
00:57:52,120 --> 00:58:04,279
There is the important business, which is obvious, but we haven't said it, that it isn't I that does the perceiving, but that one perceives in me, as he puts it on 250.

728
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:26,840
This is all part of a long discussion, which is about how we ever get so that we have in our body the correlate of how to get the right stance, so to speak, to see the color and right movement of the hand to feel the surface of something.

729
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,600
How do we do that?

730
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,999
Well, we don't do it.

731
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,359
It's something that's already done in us before we ever start.

732
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,239
It really is.

733
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,520
This is his strange way of talking about what's innate.

734
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:43,960
He sometimes says that there's a perceptual tradition.

735
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,080
He says that it's deja monte, that it's already built in.

736
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:51,160
Of course, he's got to have that view.

737
00:58:51,160 --> 00:59:06,519
The body has already understood the basic way that you should move to get in touch with colors and the way you should move to feel objects and how you should turn your head to hear better.

738
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,360
You don't figure that out.

739
00:59:08,359 --> 00:59:12,999
And that's, and therefore, you have the sense that the body knows it already.

740
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,560
He says it in many, many different ways.

741
00:59:17,399 --> 00:59:33,280
At the bottom of 249, for instance, taken exactly as I see it in a moment of my individual history, and since sensation is a reconstruction, it presupposes in me sediment left behind by some previous constitution.

742
00:59:33,279 --> 00:59:45,280
That is, it's as if my learning about these basic ways to deal with objects and colors is something that I personally figured out.

743
00:59:45,279 --> 01:00:04,719
Now, really, and he thinks it is, he either thinks it's already innate, or it was learned when I was a baby before there was any me around, while I was just thrashing my arms and legs and finding out where my body was and how to use it, and finding out how to go.

744
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:05,919
But there's lots of innate.

745
01:00:05,919 --> 01:00:09,599
I just remember saying that I don't think he would mind.

746
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:22,160
If you put over a baby's head a kind of laser card of the sort that they like to slap around when they're lying on their back, and their hand goes, the baby's hand goes right through it.

747
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,160
The baby gets very upset.

748
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:30,160
And that's because, presumably, it's got already innate wiring for that sort of thing.

749
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,280
And I don't think Merrill Punchy thinks that's wrong.

750
01:00:33,279 --> 01:00:44,959
I think he thinks that he says at the bottom of 249, I am a sentient subject, a repository stocked with natural powers, at which I am the first to be filled with wonder.

751
01:00:45,279 --> 01:00:53,120
Well, I think that's being stocked with natural powers is having a lot of innate things in your perceptual system, right, those innate areas.

752
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,359
Innate complex, that's right.

753
01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:01,439
That's another, that's innate complex and already set up and so forth.

754
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,919
There's nothing wrong with that, and that's important to him.

755
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:06,600
And the body has that.

756
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:11,000
And therefore, he could be in the middle.

757
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:19,480
So if I wanted to remember precisely the perceptual experience, I ought to say that one perceived in me and not that I perceive it.

758
01:01:19,799 --> 01:01:30,680
And then in the next page, in Italics on 251, between my sensation and myself, there stands always the fitness of some final acquisition.

759
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:32,680
That's another name for it, the innate.

760
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:35,799
And it prevents my experience from being clear to itself.

761
01:01:35,799 --> 01:01:42,600
I experience a sensation as a modality of a general existence and one already destined for a physical world.

762
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:52,039
Yeah, that's again, that what's destined for a physical world is the fact that what I, my innate way of coping with things, fits the way works.

763
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,400
I watch them.

764
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:57,719
It runs through me without my being the cause of it.

765
01:01:58,359 --> 01:01:59,959
Do I have to say more about that?

766
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:00,439
No.

767
01:02:01,399 --> 01:02:04,520
So now we're going to go on to the next topic.

768
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,480
And that's a big topic that goes on for a long time.

769
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:10,040
The unity of the body.

770
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:12,680
In this time, the intersensorial unity.

771
01:02:13,319 --> 01:02:28,920
I mean, we had already the unity of the body and that I can do something with this arm or that arm and have to stand up a certain way if I'm going to reach for something and how all the parts of my moving body adapts to whatever I'm doing.

772
01:02:28,919 --> 01:02:31,239
But now we've got another unity story.

773
01:02:31,239 --> 01:02:33,719
There is the intersensorial body.

774
01:02:33,719 --> 01:02:36,680
And he's talking about that on 260 at the bottom.

775
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:45,239
The senses are distinct from each other and distinct from intellection insofar as each one of them brings with it a structure of being which can never be exactly transposed.

776
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:46,599
Now, oh, yeah, sorry.

777
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:50,719
He's got, he's got, he has this funny dialectic, which he doesn't explain very well.

778
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:58,640
He says, I think the way it goes is that if you're an intellectualist, you think, well, there's no problem about how the senses get unified.

779
01:02:58,879 --> 01:03:04,639
There's a unified object there with a bunch of properties, and you don't have to do any unifying.

780
01:03:05,279 --> 01:03:09,200
When you've got an object, it's already unified, its properties.

781
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,320
And then I don't know what that view is exactly.

782
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:17,200
But then comes the view, well, but each sense modality is different after all.

783
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:25,680
And then that long discussion of touch and sight and how what blind people think sight is like isn't really what sight is like.

784
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:30,640
And that seems to say, well, look, all the sense modalities are really radically different.

785
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:38,640
It's not as if there's all sort of one way of sensing things and we use it to pick up the color and the shape and the sound and stuff of objects.

786
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:45,680
Each way we have of picking up the sense qualities of objects is really different from each other one.

787
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:50,320
And that gets him back to saying, oh, yeah, but still, there's only one unified body.

788
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:52,239
They must all be interrelated.

789
01:03:52,239 --> 01:04:00,320
And then comes the synesthesia story and the mescaline story and how all it turns out you can see sounds and hear colors and so forth.

790
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:06,959
So he really starts with what he says, I think, is an intellectualist sense that it's all unified already somehow.

791
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,680
I'm not sure, constituted, I don't know what it is.

792
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:13,359
Then comes this other story about how they're all different.

793
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:18,080
I think that's an empiricist story, that they're based on the praise of J.

794
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:18,719
Dumont.

795
01:04:18,439 --> 01:04:26,239
Loans, look, it must be this touching is totally different than seeing, which is totally different than hearing, because you've got a different organ for each.

796
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:32,239
Then comes the surprising news, yeah, that you can hear colors and you can see sounds.

797
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:33,879
How many of it is the sound of the fury?

798
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,080
I mean, that's the place to go.

799
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,960
He doesn't know about the Faulkner's The Sound of the Fury.

800
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:51,640
That's what you, I mean, the first chapter of The Sound of the Fury, if you want to read it, is from the point of view of Benji, an idiot, who is very, very synesthetic and is smelling, the dice, and so forth.

801
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,959
I don't know how Faulkner did it.

802
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,640
Maybe Faulkner was the synesthetic.

803
01:04:55,879 --> 01:04:58,759
Nowadays, there's a whole thing in psychology.

804
01:04:58,759 --> 01:05:03,799
I've just been on a PhD thesis studying synesthesia.

805
01:05:03,799 --> 01:05:06,200
You have to go out and find the subjects.

806
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:12,360
Some Nero Ponte talks about it as if in a certain way everybody has it.

807
01:05:12,759 --> 01:05:13,800
We'll look at that.

808
01:05:13,799 --> 01:05:18,600
We have a little bit of it anyway, but we can intersensorially sense things.

809
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:26,840
Then if you have certain brain problems or if you take mescaline, he thinks you can really get synesthesia.

810
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:32,759
But turns out there are lots of people who have it all the time, but they don't want to talk about it because they think they're weird.

811
01:05:32,759 --> 01:05:39,880
But if you go out and look for subjects, you can find people who hear sounds and who hear colors and see sounds all the time.

812
01:05:39,879 --> 01:05:45,560
And now people are studying them a lot to see what it shows about how the brain works.

813
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:47,639
So but anyway, that's the overall picture.

814
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:50,039
So I'm jumping out to where we are.

815
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:50,999
Let's see.

816
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:59,800
So there is a unity of the senses, but then there is at the bottom of 261 a threat to the unity of the senses.

817
01:05:59,799 --> 01:06:02,759
Then comes a lot of talk about that.

818
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:10,920
So so there's the that that that's the middle of 262 where he's saying that it doesn't seem to be holistic.

819
01:06:10,919 --> 01:06:21,440
Sensory experience is unstable and alien to natural perception which we receive with our whole body all at once and which opens on interactive senses like that in sensible qualities and so forth.

820
01:06:21,439 --> 01:06:25,360
And then he's trying to say, look, that's not how it is.

821
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:33,119
As far as sensing is concerned, this is not a view he wants to defend, but he wants to explain.

822
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:41,759
As far as sensing is concerned, people think that there are radically different experiences that go with sense.

823
01:06:41,759 --> 01:06:50,079
And even with a particular sense like color, I want to mention this because I know that Alba is here, but he knows I disagree with him about this.

824
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:52,640
And Sean Kelly has written a paper about this.

825
01:06:52,960 --> 01:07:03,519
The one who wants to, on a good call, they're trying this, I'm talking not about synesthesia now.

826
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,839
It's the next issue is the bottom of 262.

827
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:07,759
I'll explain the issue first.

828
01:07:07,759 --> 01:07:18,880
When you look at this wall, instead of the one back there, and you see it as having one constant color, you also see it as the illumination is different.

829
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:26,639
And on what we see when we do, I think we know seeing things in Maroponty, exactly.

830
01:07:26,879 --> 01:07:33,279
The issue, and Meloponty is saying here, and Sean spells it out a lot, is that the one?

831
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:33,999
Okay.

832
01:07:34,399 --> 01:07:36,000
Sean spells it out a lot.

833
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,600
Within color now, we're taking just one sense.

834
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:46,400
Do you have sort of separate objective colors in your experience?

835
01:07:46,399 --> 01:07:57,519
Or is there something more fundamental, which is the interrelatedness of color experience, which isn't like having a lot of objective colors that you could distinguish.

836
01:07:58,399 --> 01:08:01,759
So does that wall match some paint tip?

837
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:05,319
That wall does match some pink tip, and you can match it up to it.

838
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:08,200
And it's a certain off eggshell white, let's say.

839
01:08:08,519 --> 01:08:21,879
But Meryloponty wants to say that the fact that it is that color of an eggshell white wall when the light isn't on it, that grayish color, that grayish color is no objective color.

840
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:26,839
That grayish color is what you see when you see eggshell light in the shade.

841
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:30,279
But what you see when you see that is not an objective color.

842
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:36,359
At the bottom of 262, I stress this because maybe we'll have to debate it with Alva sometime.

843
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:54,279
Right now, in Alva's book, he has a chapter on, or a section on Sean Technicality, and he says that he just doesn't agree with Sean that you couldn't find a color chip that matched the color of that wall in that shadow.

844
01:08:54,279 --> 01:08:57,960
And Meryl-Ponty is, I mean, one is the issue what Meryloponty says.

845
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,959
Meryloponty says you can't.

846
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,960
And it's very important that you can't.

847
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:16,519
Because what you see when you see color is, again, a holistic thing in which the whiteness of the wall, so that eight cell yellow of the wall is just that it implies that in the shadow it'll look like that, and in the brighter light it'll look like that, and in the middle light it'll look like that.

848
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:20,999
There's one color, and it looks like the wall is that color.

849
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:29,239
And then there is this interrelation of light and color, which is not another color, but is part of the way they interact.

850
01:09:29,239 --> 01:09:32,120
This is what he's saying at the bottom of 262.

851
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:35,080
And it's, let me see where to start.

852
01:09:35,399 --> 01:09:39,559
Shall I say about 15 lines, that all the sheets of paper look equally white?

853
01:09:39,559 --> 01:09:41,960
And then he says, well, no, some are in the shade.

854
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,160
Then he skips down.

855
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:52,719
But by assuming the analytic attitude, then I can isolate just the ways that the color looks in the shade.

856
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:59,439
And then I don't get a color chip color, but I don't get eggshell white in a shadow either.

857
01:09:59,439 --> 01:10:02,799
I get what he says is a, what does he call it?

858
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:08,879
a goofy, a great deed substance thick and not definitely localized.

859
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:24,000
If I once more look at the general picture, that is the wall or the white or the papers on the desk, I noticed the sheets over which a shadow was thrown were at no time identical with the sheets lying in the light, nor yet were they objectively different from it.

860
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:30,399
The whiteness of the shaded paper does not lend itself to a precise classification within the black and white range.

861
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:36,080
That means there's no chip, no color chip, or in this case, no gray chip that color fine for them.

862
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:39,759
It appears there's no definite quality, and so forth.

863
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,080
Then and only then have I found myself before, but you can break down the field.

864
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:44,719
I better read more.

865
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:50,960
It appears no definite quality, and I have brought out the quality by fixing my eyes on a portion of the visual field.

866
01:10:50,960 --> 01:11:05,200
That is, if you reflect, or if you get rid of the context, then you can see this other something or other, which is a qualia, though I think he thinks even that is something weird that you can't find it in a chip.

867
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:09,200
Then and then have I found myself before a certain qualia which absorbs my gaze.

868
01:11:09,359 --> 01:11:11,919
Now what actually is fixing my gaze?

869
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:13,759
Well, let me go on.

870
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:14,479
I got that.

871
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:21,519
From the point of view of an object, it is separating the region under scrutiny from the rest of the field, the perceptual field.

872
01:11:21,519 --> 01:11:30,479
It is interrupting the total life of the spectacle, which assigned to each visible surface a determinate coloration, taking the color into account.

873
01:11:30,479 --> 01:11:33,080
That's the holistic diet.

874
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:33,800
That's what I should say.

875
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:36,200
Oh, look, that's the holistic thing.

876
01:11:38,599 --> 01:11:42,840
And the idea that there is a sensible quality, that's what we did.

877
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:50,999
Now, I said this is the various sense modalities aren't separate, but all interact in a holistic way.

878
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,319
That's for synesthesia stories.

879
01:11:53,319 --> 01:12:06,200
So within this particular sense modality, like perception, the particular colors are not separate, but interact in this way, that they all influence each other and the light and so forth.

880
01:12:06,599 --> 01:12:18,919
So at the middle of 263, the sensible quality, far from being coincident with perception, is the peculiar product of an attitude of curiosity or observation, which breaks down the holism.

881
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:27,080
Then at the bottom of the page, the quality of the separate sensory impact occurs when I break the total structurization of my vision.

882
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:30,599
That is, I break up the Vishkal, you know, and then you get the elements.

883
01:12:30,599 --> 01:12:46,040
And the elements aren't anything that you ever really experience because normal, because normally they all get emotionally they do, like that grayish, whitish, whatever, as being part of a whole bunch of colors in a field of light and so forth.

884
01:12:47,319 --> 01:12:48,999
Okay, now we've done that.

885
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,120
Then he did, then he does the synesthesia.

886
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:57,399
He says, look, they all these colors are interrelated and synestheses show them.

887
01:12:57,399 --> 01:12:59,319
I want to see how far I can get.

888
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:02,679
I think I can finish.

889
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:03,639
Let me see.

890
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:07,959
There's all it's about how these colors are all related in an object.

891
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:08,840
We talked about that.

892
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:12,759
That stuff to do with the woolly redness of the carpet and the flexibility.

893
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:15,160
That's when we're all ice sentences.

894
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:17,479
We can see woolly redness.

895
01:13:17,479 --> 01:13:24,160
We can see, we can hear the way glass sounds when it breaks, when we see how it shatters, and so forth.

896
01:13:24,319 --> 01:13:26,960
He's got a whole big story about that.

897
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,160
I'm not sure I'm convinced.

898
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:30,239
It's probably 267.

899
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:40,239
The people of the glass tells us about what it's made of, and gold looks the way it's made of, and wood looks like what it's made of, and so forth.

900
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:42,399
You have to check it with your own experience.

901
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:52,399
It doesn't, I don't think it matters whether we really have that much of interest in storial experience or not, but we certainly must have some.

902
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:55,759
Oh, I see there's one whole issue we haven't talked about.

903
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,120
Okay, we'll start with it next time.

904
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:01,759
Let me just tell you where it is, because it's so interesting what he does with it.

905
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:10,160
And that is he does a whole riff on binocular perception, starting at the bottom of 269.

906
01:14:12,639 --> 01:14:14,160
Making the starts earlier.

907
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:17,120
Yeah, on 268.

908
01:14:17,439 --> 01:14:24,479
It's about how, with two eyes, I come to see one object with depth.

909
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:32,239
And I tell you to look at it because it's all in terms of balance and synthesis and just the kind of thing we want it to be.

910
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:36,719
So next time I'm going to do the binocular vision part, and then we're going to go on to the step.
