1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,001
At the end of last session, Burke asked two questions today.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,681
The first was what does existential mean existence of existential structure or typical single existential weather structure?

3
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:12,961
This thing, what is this supposed to mean?

4
00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:14,720
And what's the use of this?

5
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:16,960
Why does Naropon have used it?

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,601
In this very section of the chapter.

7
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:24,640
And the second question, which is obviously related, is then what does the existence mean?

8
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:34,321
And the answer to the answer to these questions lies in Neuropotty evident data of the body, what the body means.

9
00:00:34,641 --> 00:00:54,080
And what we see in this chapter, and this this is another reason why it's really helpful to understand the way NeuroPonte deals with the problems it successfully copes with influenza perception is that the body is here very clearly defined as a general function of transposibility.

10
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:00,960
But what you have to have in mind from the very beginning, and I will then develop this.

11
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:04,240
This general function of transposition means two things.

12
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:12,880
It means general means, and that's why I'm releasing it to the ambiguity of the body.

13
00:01:12,881 --> 00:01:25,360
General means that the body is that, thanks to which you're sort of carrying out with yourself a various array of conducts that arise in different situations.

14
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,721
But the thing is, so what changes can be the situations?

15
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:33,200
And this is one of the meanings of general.

16
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,601
All is there.

17
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:43,160
And the second meaning of it, with which Maropony deals mostly or the that the pushed in this chapter.

18
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:56,440
The the second meaning of general, or the second part of this meaning, is that this generality is present in all of the layers that constitute the embodied life.

19
00:01:56,441 --> 00:02:11,400
So it means that the existential structure is being present at the biological level, as well as at the personal level, as well as mean accessory level.

20
00:02:11,721 --> 00:02:17,321
So that's why the existential the existential structure.

21
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:17,960
Why is that?

22
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:21,561
Because it shows that there's an internal connection between all these layers.

23
00:02:21,561 --> 00:02:31,321
So it means that when and these two meanings are general, you sort of always carry with yourself this very existential structure.

24
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:43,880
And the meaning of being common to all the layers is related to the very same empirical tendency, you might want to say.

25
00:02:43,881 --> 00:02:59,241
Because obviously you can the thing Melvonti wants to stress is that you can go from one situation to another that are completely different insofar as these layers are facilitated by the situation.

26
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:03,881
You can go from a purely biological situation to a purely personal.

27
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:09,001
And even so, you'd be carrying with yourself this very thing.

28
00:03:09,001 --> 00:03:31,480
And what this heads towards is the fact that the body as being general has to be related with once again, but the also says in the preface that this the body is the only thing to which you can relate all the behaviors, the human beings, it's that sense to which you can have a global picture, a global picture.

29
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,681
So, in terms of mean, and this is this is how it's being phenologically presented.

30
00:03:36,681 --> 00:03:45,360
You need it in order to have a center to relate all the dimensions, the common point.

31
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,400
And this means that, this is very important.

32
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:55,041
This is the way you have to understand what Heroes says when he says that the flow of existence runs through the body and everything.

33
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,241
All these kinds of metaphors.

34
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:02,960
It simply means that all these dimensions of existence are being related to the body.

35
00:04:02,961 --> 00:04:06,881
They can be understood insofar as related to the body.

36
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:12,161
And it's various concepts that you might think are being separated.

37
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:13,760
But precisely, they're not.

38
00:04:13,761 --> 00:04:19,841
And this is where Nero carries on and enters the sexual issue.

39
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:26,161
So, this is on page 158 in the old edition, so the last one is.

40
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:29,440
And in the new, it means the 180.

41
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,681
But it's just after the beginning of the paragraph.

42
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,240
For Freud himself, the sexual is not the genital.

43
00:04:38,001 --> 00:04:41,041
Okay, the whole has to be the whole beginning has to be right.

44
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:57,120
So, for Freud himself, the sexual is not a genital, meaning that sexuality is a dimension of existence that cannot only be related to the pure reflex-like working of the genital organs.

45
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:05,281
I just mainly stated by Freud in the three dots on the theory of sexuality.

46
00:05:05,281 --> 00:05:08,880
Sexual life is not a mere effect of the process of interest in the genital organs.

47
00:05:08,881 --> 00:05:14,000
The legitimate is not an instinct, that is an activity naturally directed towards definite ends that intense.

48
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:26,201
It is the general power which the cytosomatic subject enjoys of taking root in different settings, of establishing himself through different experiences, of gaining structures of conduct.

49
00:05:22,881 --> 00:05:30,121
So this is the what I call the existential further to sum it up.

50
00:05:30,761 --> 00:05:33,081
This book causes a man to have a history.

51
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:40,761
Insofar as a man's sexual history provides the huge life, so is it does that mean he's being reductionist and so on?

52
00:05:40,761 --> 00:05:43,800
It is because in his sexuality is projected his manner.

53
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,561
So this is the intentional arc, right?

54
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:51,000
Is projected his manner of being towards the world, that is towards time and other memory.

55
00:05:51,320 --> 00:06:18,920
There are sexual symptoms at the root of all hymnosis, but these symptoms, correctly interpreted, symbolize a whole attitude, whether, for example, one of conquest or of flight into the sexual history conceived as the elaboration of a general form of life, all psychological constituents can enter because there's no longer an interaction of two causalities and because the genital life is geared to the whole life of the subject.

56
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:30,360
So the thing is this whole picture that I've been drawing you here used in order to show that it can sort of work to explore all dimensions of human life, even sexuality.

57
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,920
And here what's interesting is that, I mean, what's the use of all this?

58
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:42,680
Well, here it helps because you might want to use it to stress the different existential attitudes, right?

59
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:49,401
They can symbolize a whole attitude, whether, for example, one of inquest or of flight, which are not the same.

60
00:06:49,401 --> 00:07:03,961
So this will be an alternative account for the or one of the broad aims of psychoanalysis, which has been, you could say, character study, which some very minimum psychoanalysis have been defended.

61
00:07:04,601 --> 00:07:08,041
But the thing is, how can this be used be of use for us?

62
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:12,161
For us, we want to understand how the body has a general function of transposition.

63
00:07:12,161 --> 00:07:14,081
It's at work here.

64
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:20,320
And to understand this, we need to reach towards the end of this, as usual, very long paragraph.

65
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,640
So 380, which means 40 could be 15.

66
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:30,321
Well, there there are two words in ideas, expression and meaning, and my piece is just over them.

67
00:07:30,641 --> 00:07:36,961
So if the sentence starts with finally, as we have indicated above, finally hasn't had indicated above.

68
00:07:38,641 --> 00:07:40,560
Yeah, okay, thanks.

69
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:49,041
Biological existence is synchronized with human existence, with this person, and never indifferent to its distinctive rhythm.

70
00:07:49,041 --> 00:08:00,240
Nevertheless, we shall now add, living is a primary process from which, as a turning point, it becomes possible to live this or that world, meaning you experience.

71
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:11,841
And we must be and read before perceiving and weakening evolution of living, belonging to colours and lines through sight, through sounds through hearing, so the body of another through sexuality, before arriving at the biofuel.

72
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:21,281
The sight, hearing, sexuality in the body are not only the roots, the latter takes up and absorbs into itself their existence as it is.

73
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:37,360
What this means is that, as this is this is the concrete way, now the robotic begins to explore the relationship between these dimensions and to say that to him they're not or they shouldn't be conceived of as separated, thanks to this existential person.

74
00:08:37,361 --> 00:08:48,800
And he gives and discusses a very very interesting very interesting case, both followed by Beanswanger.

75
00:08:48,800 --> 00:09:05,401
So it's it's this if you're interested in in phenomenology, that guy might be worth reading, because he was the only person who was at the same time personally reading Heimager, Ulsero, and Freud articulating many perspectives.

76
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:10,761
And Foucault gave the preface of the first translation of his works in French.

77
00:09:10,761 --> 00:09:13,801
I decided on the quite a few preface.

78
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:25,081
Just a moment earlier I've said that besides making constructions that you might like or dislike, wasn't the only aim that the body had in mind.

79
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:34,761
And so now he uses this interconnection between layers that are being articulated by the body to explore the case given to us by Beanswanger.

80
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:47,161
So I might just, okay, I'll read the beginning of the next paragraph and I'll stress what I a girl whose mother has forbidden her to see again the young man with whom she's in love, cannot speak, loses her appetite, and finally the use of speech.

81
00:09:47,481 --> 00:10:00,281
An initial manifestation of this loss of speech is found to have occurred during her childhood after an earthquake and subsequently again following a series of might want to stress the importance of the the oral phase of sexual development.

82
00:10:01,641 --> 00:10:07,241
But what matters is what the body says here, but what is fixed because he takes this issue and discusses it.

83
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:16,281
But what is fixated on the mouth, okay, so she loses appetite, use the mouth for this, and the speech uses the mouth as well.

84
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:24,200
What's fixated on the mouth is not merely sexual existence, but more generally those relations with others having the spoken word as their vehicle.

85
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,360
So that means it's the general personal level that's being lost.

86
00:10:29,641 --> 00:10:42,001
Lots of speech then, just as you said a few lines after, stands for the refusal of coexistence, just as in other subjects, the phytophytics is the means of escaping from the situation.

87
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:44,800
The patient breaks with personal life, blah blah blah.

88
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:54,561
And then her inability to swallow food arises from the fact that swallowing symbolizes the movement of existence, which carries evidence.

89
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,881
So what does that quite coincide mean?

90
00:10:58,881 --> 00:11:07,041
It means that to understand the various symptoms that the girl has, you have to relate them to a general structure of existence.

91
00:11:08,320 --> 00:12:15,240
When he says that swallowing symbolizes the movement of existence, it means that this the symptom she has, this the fact that she won't eat, has to be understood first and foremost in relation to this existential structure that then allows you to understand the relationship between the different levels of life which are touched by the very same symptom that you have to understand not using the mouth in an existential so he proposes he proposes a particular example of psychopathoma you have to relate this or that symptom to the way the body symbolizes existence and then you can understand what the relation is between the fact that she won't eat which would seem to be and the fact that she won't talk to be only personal this isn't the loginical problem so the thing is you have to be careful with this with the concept of origin when you use it so what would it mean that it's it's it could be starting from sexual, from a sexual original experience that we will discussed today?

92
00:12:15,241 --> 00:12:22,281
Is that what i mean i just mean isn't there a basic as to the sexual dimension of a problem?

93
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:30,920
Well, the thing is, to answer the question correctly, I would have to enter into the fact that for psychoanalysis, temporarily is not linear temporality.

94
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:49,641
And that the sexual dimension of the first episode, which is trauma, what it says is that the sexual signification of the trauma is required afterwards when you re-experience the second, a second occurrence of it that can be simplified related to the first.

95
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,840
This is probably.

96
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:54,841
I guess what it means is that sexual frustration.

97
00:12:55,161 --> 00:12:57,241
The business.

98
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,161
Yes, but fair enough.

99
00:12:59,161 --> 00:13:03,800
But the thing is, the first experience that she had was that of another split, which isn't.

100
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,401
I thought that the first one.

101
00:13:10,761 --> 00:13:20,361
So you remember I just said that this was a way of dealing with a characteristic that is being the principal in psychopathology.

102
00:13:20,361 --> 00:13:25,641
And now Melopoti clearly relates this, and the fact that obviously there's something with the body, all right?

103
00:13:25,641 --> 00:13:29,321
It's really that provides structure that embodies.

104
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,441
And Melopoti has a sentence that consists of this.

105
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,161
So for me, it's 152, so for you probably.

106
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:36,920
187.

107
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,680
So he says, which says thus in hysteria and repression.

108
00:13:40,761 --> 00:13:42,441
Don't you invite?

109
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:43,001
Okay.

110
00:13:46,361 --> 00:13:58,841
But in hysteria and repression, we may well overlook something, although we know of it, because our memories and our body, instead of presenting themselves to us in singular and determinate conscious acts, are endolatic generality.

111
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,361
But there are a few sentences that are really important here.

112
00:14:02,361 --> 00:14:18,881
But this first one is very important because you know that psychoanalysis has been heavily using the concept of repression, the thing that you don't want to see but that you know you don't want to see, and has been articulating the concept of you know, it's easy, there's just just one letter that changes.

113
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:34,241
The concept of regression means that you're drawn back the like the meaning of the comes from the fact that you've been experiencing situations somehow related, similar to so that's what we were just discussing.

114
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:37,761
So this is what we will be dealing with now.

115
00:14:38,080 --> 00:15:03,441
And the way you understand the the the way you have to understand uh the character studies or the the personality studies, the embody personality studies will include here, is that yes, there's a precise organ that's the the the single egg center that allows you to understand that these dimensions are linked and that shows, obviously, that they are.

116
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:42,321
And the consequence of this is that the sent the sentence that comes just after, whatever, through this generality, meaning that the repression and hence the big importance of the mouth in the in this in this girl's erotical quality scheme, is that it helps under understanding that, as Dobby will see the next sentence, we discover in this way that sensory messages or memories are expressly grasped and recognized by us only insofar as they adhere generally to that area of our body and our life to which they're relevant.

117
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:53,881
It would be from the opposing point and sexuality in this whole analysis, trying to do a whole story on this this pace and do it in our dreams, et cetera.

118
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,521
We are end-booking that, but we would really just mention one.

119
00:15:52,241 --> 00:16:02,281
I'll discuss this later because you need some other surgical frameworks for this.

120
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:34,121
And thus, allows to understand the unique, but ambiguous, because the unique meaning that's being displayed by the very disconnect of the body, this is what existential structure is about.

121
00:16:34,121 --> 00:16:34,680
Yes.

122
00:16:36,761 --> 00:16:47,241
Because the relevant comes from when you find that there are specific bodies or the area is the relevant.

123
00:16:47,721 --> 00:16:54,281
How does the body area is chosen if not bisexual or anything?

124
00:16:54,521 --> 00:16:55,960
Well, it doesn't mean that, well.

125
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:08,600
Yeah, but it's obviously sexual, but I'm just saying, okay, maybe there is no, I don't know the answer to that.

126
00:17:09,001 --> 00:17:12,120
I'm just saying that there is a detention between the device.

127
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:19,480
Of course not, because precisely the fact that there's this zone of the generality means it's present in all situations and in all these layers.

128
00:17:19,481 --> 00:17:20,361
That's what it means.

129
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,320
Only.

130
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:33,800
So this dimension, this the fact that the mouse is prominent, as far as you need to understand the pathological behaviors of a person in every situation or in every dimension that's that's what it means.

131
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,400
So there's no tension.

132
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:54,560
Only if you take these two words, say this and the general dimension there's no contribution whatsoever but then as far as the sexual origin is concerned you wouldn't say that you would say that sexual idea takes up and expresses something that has been as he as you know just said it in the in the sentence where he mentions all these layers.

133
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:03,761
Sexuality is a way to express other dimensions, which would which wouldn't mean that they weren't here before in a way, but they didn't have the sexual meaning.

134
00:18:03,761 --> 00:18:08,640
Consider the relationship between the earthquake and the fact that they need to acquire the sexual meaning.

135
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,521
That's maybe where I would understand better with what I would say.

136
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:14,320
Does it say you in any way?

137
00:18:15,201 --> 00:18:16,240
What's the problem with this?

138
00:18:17,441 --> 00:18:27,120
What's the what's the uh the radical plan for another uh cheating division?

139
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,600
Well, it's a statement, you just see it.

140
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:34,960
Well, well, it's the same for psychoanalysis, right?

141
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:40,881
You see that this say this or what is it is what you want to say just that the robotism to psychoanalyst?

142
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:50,880
So how can we organize and interpret the data that he gets while listening to the patients and see that this or that dimension is symbolistically prominent?

143
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,200
Is that your problem?

144
00:18:53,201 --> 00:18:53,761
I don't know.

145
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:02,640
Because anyway, this is the sentence that I just read, the the the one with that area of our body in our life to which is very relevant.

146
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,400
It's one eight I think.

147
00:19:05,921 --> 00:19:07,521
The one I just read.

148
00:19:07,761 --> 00:19:27,320
We discovered this way that sensory messages and thi this is this is this is how the robotic would would find a use for this existential purpose by relating it to the different kind of symptoms that can be seen in the different layers of endodinog.

149
00:19:27,721 --> 00:19:46,600
But this obviously happens because ultimately, as we say in the beginning of the chapter, all the dimensions that underlie the personal dimension, which includes the personal dimension, takes up all the underlying dimensions and expresses them at the personal level.

150
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,560
This is what he says, so this is 192, I think, for you.

151
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:58,761
It says at the very end of the paragraph, 10 lines before me, the end of a paragraph that ends with abstract moments.

152
00:19:58,761 --> 00:20:10,200
The sentence I'm starting with is: if we therefore say, if we therefore say that the body expresses existence at every moment, this is in the sense in which a word expresses thought.

153
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:36,521
Anterior to conventional means of expression, which reveal my thoughts to others only because already for both myself and the meanings are provided for each sign, and which in this sense do not give rise to genuine communication at all, we must, as we self-see, recognize the primary process of signification in which the thing expressed doesn't exist apart from the expression, and in which the signs themselves induce their significance externally.

154
00:20:36,521 --> 00:20:49,961
In this way, the body expresses total existence, not only biological or perceptual oppression, not because it is an external accompaniment to that existence, but because existence realizes itself in the body.

155
00:20:49,961 --> 00:21:00,441
So there's nothing else besides the body, but you have to conceive of it in such a way as to allow its different manifestations to have this existential relation between.

156
00:21:00,441 --> 00:21:08,560
And this cannot be done if you use the empiricist account, purely organical accounts, or the intellectualist account.

157
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:18,080
Because then, if you do this, you think that the relationship between these dimensions has to be found within consciousness.

158
00:21:18,721 --> 00:21:33,360
This is what Rogoti said at the very beginning of the chapter, which is impossible because the common structure to all these is a bodily structure insofar as it embodies existence.

159
00:21:33,681 --> 00:21:45,041
But this embodying existence will only mean that it can allow for a switch or for the fact that this related dimension comes to be more prominent than the others on their global circle.

160
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:58,560
But then, obviously, you can say, well, you could reply, well, you're saying that all these dimensions are related, but then you say that some of them, say, the purely sexual inner, come to be more prominent than the others.

161
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:03,840
So, what's the point then in saying that they have a relationship if you say that one is more prominent than the others?

162
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,441
And this is what ambiguity, right?

163
00:22:05,441 --> 00:22:07,120
And this is what ambiguity means precisely.

164
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:20,320
It means that even in sexual something, there's something more global that's always present that you call reality to what happens when you're in bed with the sexual.

165
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:30,160
Because the behavior you have at that very moment can only be understood on the basis of this existential nature, that is the core of everything.

166
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:36,640
So, this is my finally speak to this to this view that he calls the build ambiguity.

167
00:22:36,961 --> 00:22:42,560
This is for me on page 168, probably for you on 195.

168
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,241
So, there's no there's no way to tell you.

169
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,600
My sentence is that it is true that it's freud we have generalized the notion of sexuality.

170
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,041
So is it generality just developed?

171
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:04,600
What?

172
00:23:04,761 --> 00:23:08,120
Is 105 is the notion of generality?

173
00:23:08,441 --> 00:23:10,440
Unconscious later.

174
00:23:10,441 --> 00:23:10,841
Okay?

175
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,640
I go on and then I'll tell you what.

176
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,480
And how you can read it.

177
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:21,721
So the second is because I I'll keep about half an hour from that.

178
00:23:21,721 --> 00:23:26,600
How can it have generalized the notion of sexuality?

179
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,641
How can we then talk about the distinctive development of sexuality?

180
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,160
How can we identify a content of consciousness as sexual?

181
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,001
Indeed we cannot.

182
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:44,521
Sexuality conceals itself from itself beneath a mask of generality and continually tries to escape from the tension and drama which it sets up.

183
00:23:44,521 --> 00:23:47,241
Drama mean that it engages the whole existence.

184
00:23:47,241 --> 00:24:25,600
Okay, so now you jump about ten lines after what I've just read to a sentence that frankly the dreamer just before the dreamer okay if sexuality is neither transcended in human life nor shown up as its center by unconscious representations it is at all times present there like an atmosphere now we can understand the fact that sexuality is present in all the devotions in a that and that does you can't reduce them all to the explicitly sexual situation because even in sexual situations there are other meanings in why.

185
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:44,080
The dreamer doesn't first visualize the latent content of his dream, what the dream really means, sort of, with his with what that is which is to be really relevant with the help of suitable images by the second account, which is the way second account in psychiatrists means when you relate the dream you have.

186
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:52,080
He doesn't first organize the story of genital origin as being genital, only subsequently translating the text into figures language.

187
00:24:52,080 --> 00:25:06,161
For the dreamer indeed, who is far removed from the language on the week next day, this or that genital agitation or sexual drive is, without more ado, this image of the world being climbed or his face being steady.

188
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,400
We can think as how different texts.

189
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:28,320
Sexuality becomes gives you the images which derive from it only certain typical relationships, the typical existential relationship, that give vigoration to your only a certain general emotional feature that's present throughout the different layers of life and of personal life.

190
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,560
The dreamer's thing is becomes the surviving which appears in the manifest count.

191
00:25:32,640 --> 00:26:04,720
So finally what you can say is that nobody goes on with his account of ambiguity and the fact that ambiguity ultimately means that sexuality is present throughout all these dimensions and within personal life in all the situations that you can encounter, even though it might not seem to present the same way when you're having the sexual content and when you're in a completely different attitude.

192
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,921
You remember what I the sentence I quoted about half an hour?

193
00:26:10,241 --> 00:26:19,360
When he said that uh there are sexual symptoms at the root of all neurosis, but these symptoms, correctly interpreted, symbolize a whole attitude.

194
00:26:19,681 --> 00:26:22,480
For example, one of contest, one of flight.

195
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:38,041
So I think you have to relate what I just said the fact that there's a particular part of the body that's being be it as a single or as a normal constituent of stack and type of life in all the dimensions.

196
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:45,080
And that for this very reason, there's no safe layer or dimension like the purely sexual.

197
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,521
That you would have to start from in order to understand the others.

198
00:26:48,521 --> 00:27:01,241
So be well, which wouldn't mean that since you would have no meaning at all, but that if you really want to understand the sexual part, you would have to see how the rest of life can be related to it.

199
00:27:01,241 --> 00:27:03,080
Not meaning that it has to be related.

200
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:07,480
One dimension in existence is being symbolized or acquires a meaning.

201
00:27:07,481 --> 00:27:17,480
So it's a window through which you can see this existential structure that I've been talking about.

202
00:27:18,281 --> 00:27:38,681
I think the first question that I don't need to answer, maybe keep it in mind as you go on, it really takes back just a moment, but I think I think it's a worthwhile question to interrupt you, but it has to do with the notion of the body as a general function transposition has become very, very general.

203
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:45,560
Quite far removed from one mundane, non-technical angles.

204
00:27:47,001 --> 00:27:50,041
What do you mean by physical body as being more mundane?

205
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:56,761
You know, a lot of the senses that you have in the term body the true mind could have been used.

206
00:27:56,761 --> 00:28:03,521
And then one sense that this way the body expresses significance experimentally.

207
00:28:03,521 --> 00:28:11,281
He then goes on and learns this incarnate significance is present of the model of body and mind finding things.

208
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:17,361
Okay, so now we're facing the problem of the translation because Melopotty never did his one.

209
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,001
He uses escrit, which is spirit.

210
00:28:22,481 --> 00:28:37,041
It makes a big difference because Melbourne's account of the relationship between escrit and body stems from the lecture of Hegel that was carried on in France in his years, especially from a Greece article from a Greece guy.

211
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,480
Meloponty, a screening subject.

212
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,201
It only subject, not mind.

213
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:46,400
Well, my real question is what body means.

214
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,720
And I just, because it's clear how sort of Dr.

215
00:28:50,961 --> 00:28:56,560
Christian's story about maximum growth goes in the case of sensory body perception.

216
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:05,680
But it just begins to get much more metaphorical what it means about biology and the sexual and the subject.

217
00:29:05,681 --> 00:29:09,440
And in other words, it's just a label for the problem.

218
00:29:09,441 --> 00:29:11,360
What is the subject or what is the body?

219
00:29:11,521 --> 00:29:13,361
It's not really clear that the body is.

220
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,521
So I just wanted to come back to that because you just...

221
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:19,120
Well, actually, I'm pretty much done with what I wanted to say.

222
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:22,080
So I can, I guess I come back.

223
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,160
But the thing is, first of all, Melbourne wants to describe and not to explain.

224
00:29:26,481 --> 00:29:30,881
So he wants to find a way to relate these symptoms to these dimensions.

225
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,320
So it's not a I can do it, look how I do it.

226
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:45,521
I've been very persuaded, educated by your description of the ambiguity of the relation between the biological, the perceptual, the personal, the sexual, that there is a kind of an ambiguity.

227
00:29:45,521 --> 00:29:52,960
But the body is a functional transposition within the theory as a kind of explanatory purpose.

228
00:29:55,001 --> 00:30:01,640
If the body is a functional transposition, it is being to explain how it can be that we can move from one situation to another.

229
00:30:01,961 --> 00:30:18,041
And I just want to ask you, it's meant to be the name of that thanks to which you can move from one situation to another, but certainly not to explain in the way you might consider it, except if you wanted to explain a more generally speaking epistemological intuition.

230
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,041
But the thing is, ultimately, what it refers to in all these situations is that.

231
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:24,840
And why does Melobotti talk about the body all the time?

232
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:33,800
If you read the preface carefully, you see that he says that the reduction as Terry Dunbar himself cannot be done completely.

233
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,121
There's something that remains from reduction.

234
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:43,320
And this is the body that's always, as he says about 200 times in the book, in front.

235
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,080
And this is how you have to understand this very peculiar experience.

236
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:53,640
This is how you have to understand what it means by value, because precisely it's the fact that Meloboti doesn't want to say that conscience is bullshit.

237
00:30:53,640 --> 00:31:11,880
Yes, but let me think, because I have a lot of it just means that, generally speaking, in all these dimensions, the body is that thanks to which there's something happening to you prior to you having consciousness of it and orchestrating it or constituting it.

238
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,921
This is the only thing that body means.

239
00:31:14,921 --> 00:31:36,840
It's that in all these layers and in all the various situations, personal life, be they sexual, there are things that happen that lead you to behave in such or such a way or another that give you, say, even personal fortunes, whatever, that you experience as oriented being you towards this or that.

240
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:47,281
And this is, and so you sort of receive, it's a matter of conceiving how the relationship between the body and the consciousness is in terms of receptivity.

241
00:31:47,761 --> 00:31:49,680
This is the term that's very useful to understand.

242
00:31:49,681 --> 00:31:56,160
So you're receptive because the body allows you to be receptive to all these different layers.

243
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:01,200
And thus, thanks to the body, then you're being drawn towards this or that.

244
00:32:01,201 --> 00:32:02,161
And you act.

245
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,161
And that's why the body is useful.

246
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:15,440
It's to understand how you're being led, the world orients you, even in the perceptual level, as remember Malboff says it in the chapter of the thing.

247
00:32:15,761 --> 00:32:20,080
And the same experience you live at the completely different level, say, in the sexual.

248
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,361
It's that you're not thinking because consciousness means reflection, right?

249
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:36,160
Thinking about what you're and there's a basic layer, pre-reflective layer of experience, which is in which the consciousness is only receptive to what's carried to what is caring towards it from the baby thing.

250
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:57,840
But when you say that the body is the only thing that enables you to relate all the different conducts and activities of life, it is that then which we have a global picture, it sounds as if body is something you've been using to explain why we go on this way or that, or how you manage the global picture.

251
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:04,320
But it's become so big that nature is what explains how you have a global picture.

252
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,320
Or the world is that very intelligent.

253
00:33:06,481 --> 00:33:10,400
Well, no, nature does not explain why you have a global picture.

254
00:33:10,401 --> 00:33:16,320
Because there can only be a subject insofar as you're embodying, because the body is that thanks to which there can be a subject.

255
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,041
Without body, there would be no subject, right?

256
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:28,201
It's only because of the body that you can understand, that you can see, finding that there's a subject, because there's a common structure that's being widespread throughout all the different behaviors of the person.

257
00:33:29,481 --> 00:33:34,281
So there's not the valuability of the consciousness not thanks to the body.

258
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:39,880
It's thanks to the body that you can understand through regarding frustrating that they're developed.

259
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,680
And how does that work?

260
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,440
Well, because it has to understand the relationship between all the different.

261
00:33:44,921 --> 00:33:47,400
It's not thanks to the consciousness that you can do this.

262
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:53,080
It's only thanks to the body because the consciousness couldn't find its way.

263
00:33:53,961 --> 00:34:16,761
Because the experiences that you have when you're also hungry and well, the experience that you have when you're perceiving a chair can't be related only thanks to the consciousness because it would be purely formal, meaning it wouldn't be relate, you couldn't relate it to an experience.

264
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:27,641
Whereas through him, there's a way to relate all these dimensions to an experience, which is the fact that the body is in front ofward with the prior interface with the world.

265
00:34:27,881 --> 00:34:31,881
In another philosophical tradition, people talk about consciousness not being reflection.

266
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:40,280
You might talk about conscious meaning experience, or consciousness meaning the idea that whatever you're in your body has some positive character for you.

267
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:48,201
So in that sense of experience, in that sense of consciousness, it sounds like the body is conscious.

268
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:56,361
And so there's no light appeal to the reflectivity of the intellect or understanding to make sense of the structure.

269
00:34:56,361 --> 00:35:02,640
But there is some primitive conception of human experience, which is which we're talking about.

270
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:17,681
Except that, well, you would have to relate it to the fact that, as I mentioned previously at the beginning of the first lecture, there's this operative intentionality that is what you can characterize the subject like.

271
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:31,921
The subject is what relates the different moments of time and what actually in a way creates them as being intentional moments, the moments towards my grasping of birds recognizing, for example.

272
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:43,681
So the thing is then you would have to give another story in order to explain how and why you're being task related and how and why you can understand see someone being task related.

273
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:50,160
Thanks to the fact that you see his or her body moving and arguing that begins to sound problematic for me.

274
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,200
It begins to sound like just looking the statement.

275
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,760
Biology, perception, sexuality, they're all related.

276
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,521
That's what I'm going to put this.

277
00:35:59,521 --> 00:36:01,200
What?

278
00:36:01,441 --> 00:36:11,840
Except that it's it seems to be pretty much related with empirical work as far as for example psychopathology is concerned, right?

279
00:36:11,841 --> 00:36:14,001
And I've read a few passages on this.

280
00:36:14,001 --> 00:36:14,400
Yeah.

281
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,760
Can I get into this?

282
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:18,800
Yeah, this is this is a version of the question.

283
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,680
I've seen Alice problem.

284
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:28,800
It's it's hard to know once you say that all these layers are related if you added anything when you say thanks to the body.

285
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,721
But let me just switch to the sexuality question further.

286
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,000
Is that a specially privileged dimension?

287
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:44,241
Or could we say, you know, related to things is food is also an important uh existential dimension.

288
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:54,600
And if you tell me I'm not related to everything as food, I tell you what I'm requesting over the relation to some things food, and I don't know whether I've sublimated them, and I don't know it.

289
00:36:54,841 --> 00:36:59,640
Why don't we think that it's a general capacity to relate to everything sexual?

290
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,280
Is that does Paranofungi think?

291
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,481
Does he believe for it?

292
00:37:03,481 --> 00:37:04,280
Why should he?

293
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,041
That this is some special dimension of human experience.

294
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:14,680
I don't know what he proposed, you said to me last time, has corrupted or cleared my mind.

295
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,041
I have any one thing.

296
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:27,160
He owes us an explanation of why he thinks the sexuality is a more important dimension of human experience than, say, our relation to things that can be eaten or not eaten.

297
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:33,721
But I think this precisely that I said that I read when you say that you can have a personal experience if you don't eat, right?

298
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:38,680
Yeah, the thing you want to say is that you can't separate them all out.

299
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,880
Well, then sexuality is no special or than any of the others.

300
00:37:41,881 --> 00:37:42,600
And he does.

301
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:42,921
No.

302
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:48,120
But did I say that it's more special than the others?

303
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:56,281
Well, yes, because I think to account for the personal level of behavior, sexuality is much more important than the need.

304
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,441
Maybe not the way you eat or this can be a different story.

305
00:38:00,441 --> 00:38:04,120
But the fact that you need to eat is certainly not very personal.

306
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,760
I think many other people in the room should say, right?

307
00:38:06,841 --> 00:38:09,961
Well, then let's take on the personal level your role in the culture.

308
00:38:09,961 --> 00:38:14,200
You're given an identity or the lower job fit into the value.

309
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,641
That's very gentle.

310
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:21,480
And for that in sure, then say that you've got to take a stand on your own being, by the way, of some role.

311
00:38:21,481 --> 00:38:26,680
Well, he doesn't say things are he doesn't say you're positive either of us.

312
00:38:26,921 --> 00:38:27,320
No.

313
00:38:27,801 --> 00:39:07,041
I guess I'm asking again why is why this chapter on sexuality rather than a chapter on say identity or on mood or on food and explanation of because you feel that something peculiar something bodily peculiar happening when you're first of all when you're having sexual and he say he starts from this and then he says okay how can I relate this to the rest of existence with regards to this specificity and to the specificity of the rest of existence knowing that you can't conceive of the existence as having contingent or necessary parts they're all interrelated.

314
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:12,080
Yes, this is what he says at the end of the relation.

315
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,560
Is it more of a special dimension than spending?

316
00:39:15,441 --> 00:39:18,080
Because well, speech isn't speech isn't personal.

317
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,441
It's what allows you to have personal relations with other people.

318
00:39:21,441 --> 00:39:26,961
So it's the condition of personal speech behavior.

319
00:39:31,521 --> 00:39:34,640
But it's it's not a matter of being basic or more general.

320
00:39:34,881 --> 00:39:36,881
Because I don't know what the right words are here.

321
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,041
It's not more general.

322
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:40,560
It's a part of the general.

323
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,320
Everything is a configuration.

324
00:39:44,481 --> 00:39:50,560
I think by then all this appears into this and the human economy in which everything is related to everything.

325
00:39:50,560 --> 00:40:02,400
And then the question is, well, why is things allowed say speech and sexuality over food, over uh the because food doesn't seem to be very personal once they get not very human, actually, because animals eat a lot.

326
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:08,080
So but it doesn't have the same it doesn't have the same dimension.

327
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:16,560
No worries you can talk of you can you can talk of sexual instincts for animals, whereas for humans it's worth much more confusing to push the configurations at the beginning of the chapter.

328
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:22,041
But it gets to the point where having hair and fingernails and everything is equally essential to being human.

329
00:40:22,001 --> 00:40:24,440
In in the I don't forget whether it's in this chapter.

330
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:37,961
But when everything is equally different, then I don't understand him why because you're you're you're just skipping what's going on this goal into the chapter.

331
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,320
I don't understand this problem.

332
00:40:39,481 --> 00:40:44,120
Well I've been talking about it for an hour now so you're and I think one doesn't have a problem.

333
00:40:50,361 --> 00:41:00,201
I kept answering them or trying to at least hold on there's people on the line.

334
00:41:00,521 --> 00:41:05,320
Whoever is next now I don't know who's next to you that you have you were.

335
00:41:05,321 --> 00:41:08,280
Well originally but originally then.

336
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,721
Okay, right.

337
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:25,401
I don't know if it helps but what struck me when when you compare the the capital mortality for the personal motility together and sexuality and it's could it turn out as Keiner has a problem which is very much related in both chapters.

338
00:41:25,401 --> 00:41:27,080
You you can't make this possible.

339
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,640
I think I've got less very because you can't point to something.

340
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:40,921
So it means you can't be attractive to something uh in our side hopefully situation like maybe perfectly or or and the same structure you have here sexuality.

341
00:41:40,921 --> 00:41:49,801
You mustn't quite understand how something can be uh affected by something or by someone or by some experience.

342
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:59,160
And so I would say this is the same in essential structure again as that gesture and can be attractive to Skinner itself.

343
00:41:59,801 --> 00:42:01,080
Well it doesn't have.

344
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,920
And so he explains this practice.

345
00:42:02,921 --> 00:42:04,280
But I don't know the next sentence.

346
00:42:04,521 --> 00:42:11,680
It helps to understand the beginning of the chapter, but maybe what we mentioned enough is that all the end of the chapter is a discussion.

347
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:21,600
So most of what I've been discussing today is the only aim of this is to show that you can't reduce everything to sexuality.

348
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,160
No, that's true.

349
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,921
My example shows absolute notable.

350
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,600
Yeah, it's explained.

351
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:40,800
It still understand that there are, there's a peculiar positive way of experiencing a specific kind of operative intentionality in two origins.

352
00:42:40,801 --> 00:42:44,560
So this means there's an original dimension that's called sexuality in life.

353
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,641
Three, most people say it's beyond the dimension in life.

354
00:42:48,961 --> 00:42:52,400
And most predictive interpretations of Freud say that is it true.

355
00:42:52,401 --> 00:42:54,400
And then discuss it.

356
00:42:55,441 --> 00:42:59,041
The whole one is a problem in general, but hello.

357
00:43:01,361 --> 00:43:16,800
He said that to him, you can interpret Freud as saying that, and he doesn't agree with it, but I think Freud is more complicated, and it's related to the question about the unconscious that's been raised previously because the fact is it can turn into very technical discussions.

358
00:43:16,801 --> 00:43:38,881
But the thing is, for Freud, once again, in three states of sexual theory, he says that he builds his whole people and they say that there's a force that's called individual sexual drive that is the dynamical pattern to which you have to relate everything that happens in life.

359
00:43:39,521 --> 00:43:49,921
And what he says, well, yes and no, it's irreducible, but still you can't relate everything to it as if it would really be the basic.

360
00:43:49,921 --> 00:43:55,001
It gives you an insight on many things that no other dimension can give you an insight on.

361
00:43:52,961 --> 00:44:00,440
That means that it's the thing that you have to reduce everything to.

362
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,041
Okay, but that I'm back to my generality atmosphere thing.

363
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:17,640
But they claim that it's a special dimension, that for Maori's and people in Bali, everything that people do is colored by the relation to their sexuality doesn't seem to be plausible at all.

364
00:44:17,961 --> 00:44:22,921
He just takes it over dogmatically from Freud and then gives it his first spin.

365
00:44:22,921 --> 00:44:30,361
But I don't understand where the basic claims that the generality of the sexual atmosphere comes from.

366
00:44:30,361 --> 00:44:42,280
I doubt if it's even always claiming that it's double named something, but I mean it is obviously in many people's religious relationship things that sexuality is in there at all.

367
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,800
That's going to say there's a point where you have to be right.

368
00:44:45,801 --> 00:44:48,041
Yeah, well, that's the point.

369
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,360
I don't mind.

370
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:56,680
The way I'm saying you guys, I'm not exactly sure what I'm about to say.

371
00:44:57,001 --> 00:44:59,160
I'm sorry, I haven't lost in this book.

372
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,921
But there are a few key passages that I think might be a little amazing.

373
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:08,281
So you want to explain us right now and read the key passages now?

374
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,720
I'm not going to read the passages.

375
00:45:14,361 --> 00:45:24,920
So I think between trying to see the body and your certainty of a subjective experience and collapse all the dimensions of what we want to do.

376
00:45:24,921 --> 00:45:40,640
But I think he says in the other song, I think you have to expand your susceptibility and see that there are no world, which doesn't take each body as a singular subjective.

377
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,920
I mean, they are subjective.

378
00:45:41,921 --> 00:45:44,000
And this is what the end of the book is about.

379
00:45:44,001 --> 00:45:56,001
He says, because he has inherited his shared world, the fact remains that it is not a lesson subjectivity of each of us that each one projects this one and only world.

380
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:01,360
He talks about health freedom where my freedom, it is a state for me to be free.

381
00:46:01,521 --> 00:46:03,281
I'm giving to myself.

382
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,801
And it all goes about how there can be a subjective experience that we're also eastern.

383
00:46:08,801 --> 00:46:14,320
But okay, so I think you brought enough topics to discuss for a year.

384
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,520
I'm trying.

385
00:46:19,521 --> 00:46:34,240
Okay, so in the other cells, when you do a long chapter, at the end, he says, henceforth, he's talking about how you recognize our own self, and he's talking about recognizing people you already know in the world and your integrity, he said, henceforth is the parts of my body together compromising systems.

386
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:45,520
So my body and the others are one whole two-sided one-seem phenomenon and the anonymous existence of which my bodies that everyone would face, henceforth, and have exposed bodies simultaneously.

387
00:46:45,521 --> 00:46:48,961
So you have to get away with your body and go and talk about the anonymous.

388
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:55,760
So first of all, you have to talk about all the dimensions and from a more than comprehensive formula.

389
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,441
Well, the thing is that things to each person are.

390
00:47:05,441 --> 00:47:09,360
I don't have a really subjective world.

391
00:47:09,361 --> 00:47:11,200
I have a really, I have a very well-being.

392
00:47:11,521 --> 00:47:14,160
Subjectivity is not something that normal asserts.

393
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:14,800
There has to be.

394
00:47:14,801 --> 00:47:19,280
But first of all, when you say you're certain of, no, you're not certain of anything big.

395
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:26,041
You're not certain of anything, but you are certain of the world in general and hold that not only contributions.

396
00:47:29,881 --> 00:47:32,680
That you have to differentiate from the graphical first.

397
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:41,640
Then we talked about the anonymous level of experience and that's that comes thanks to the body, because there can be experience.

398
00:47:45,001 --> 00:47:59,481
When we were discussing with Alpha what this finger body meant, and I said that the body is the name of the experience that you have, that things come to your consciousness and that you're motivated to act in such or such a way.

399
00:47:59,481 --> 00:48:01,080
So this is what anonymous means.

400
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:08,761
It means that it hasn't yet reached the consciousness, but it's already providing a meaning that you choose to accomplish or not.

401
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,080
And precisely, then you've been talking about freedom and freedom.

402
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,600
What is freedom?

403
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:24,121
It's the fact that you can choose amongst different meanings that are available to you thanks to the fact that the situation has always, it's always ambiguous within the personal dimension.

404
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:28,280
That's why these cases marks two pages at the end of the sexuality chapter.

405
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:35,001
This is this is and that's why you need the sexuality chapter to understand what you say in the freedom chapter because for novelty freedom is ambiguous.

406
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:40,201
It's the fact that a situation has different meanings and that you can choose among them.

407
00:48:40,841 --> 00:48:45,961
So this this might be a way for you to relate all the the the topics that you mentioned.

408
00:48:45,961 --> 00:48:49,001
So there can be no freedom without the body, which is against self.

409
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,400
Says that you just choose at every moment what you're doing.

410
00:48:51,401 --> 00:49:00,281
Involved he says, well, choose what you're going to be doing thanks to the fact that you're being led to differentiate directions of action.

411
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:06,600
And this is thanks to the first offense.

412
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,560
I I think there's two problems here, isn't it?

413
00:49:08,881 --> 00:49:23,680
One is that you think that you make sexuality too too important and the other one is that it becomes all the extra and that you can't differentiate anymore between biological, the perceptual and asexual compounds.

414
00:49:23,841 --> 00:49:25,760
I think both are not really a problem.

415
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:57,041
And first of all, because I think it's this the sexual sexuality is not to make sexuality the most important dimension of human starts to say that you shouldn't have discrete perceptual.

416
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:08,721
There's also what I like to get this more clear is this little footnote at the end of the book which I didn't like because of the biomarker of the I didn't like it but it well don't matter.

417
00:50:09,441 --> 00:50:25,441
But what's happening there is speaking about history and he's speaking about the various ways to look at history from a point of economic from a point of law, common point of management, and all these variants do have something to them.

418
00:50:25,441 --> 00:50:29,281
And you cannot reduce reality to just one of them.

419
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,360
But he says anyway, it's not what suit but another equation.

420
00:50:33,361 --> 00:50:39,120
But in each particular case, one of the order can be redirected dominant.

421
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:53,881
So in each particular situation you can look uh what's what's going on there and still conclude that in this particular situation that uh the economic was most important and in the last situation it can be uh the related situation at that time.

422
00:50:53,881 --> 00:50:57,001
So perhaps if you can never assert it you know that's right.

423
00:50:52,961 --> 00:50:59,160
That's what your total donality does.

424
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:06,600
That indeed when I'm eating a steak it's the biological food is a or food situation and when I'm having sex it's the sex situation.

425
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:11,881
But this is probably what he said, otherwise maybe we we don't have to spend three hours on this.

426
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,680
It's not that you're just being in this or that situation.

427
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:18,681
Eric is right because on the one hand you say, well there's so much sexuality in it.

428
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:22,521
And when you try to explain how it's related, we'll still differentiate it from the other situation.

429
00:51:22,521 --> 00:51:23,640
You say, well, it's a big soup.

430
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,800
Well, I don't understand how it's different.

431
00:51:25,801 --> 00:51:27,640
It seems to be a big soup.

432
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:32,760
And and when you tell me that in eating in each situation, I understand something dominant.

433
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,280
That's not how we lose models.

434
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:39,481
And for I didn't think that just in the sex sexuation sex was dominant in the economic situation.

435
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:44,521
Anybody would think that Marx thought there is something special about the ideology.

436
00:51:44,521 --> 00:51:53,721
And for you that there's something special about the sexual this is something he he disagreed with well if you don't agree then that there are nothing more to tell.

437
00:51:53,961 --> 00:52:05,320
Of course he has because if you're in the chapter on the fiddlism of the merchandise in the capital, one you have to understand that obviously you can't produce everything to know you because there's an ideological tension with it.

438
00:52:08,921 --> 00:52:18,600
Then why is there also claim let's go back to sexuality that sex is the least important because of everything, then you got a real point.

439
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:26,521
You can claim that in some situations it's more important than others, but that no situation comes to us any of that without sexuality anymore.

440
00:52:26,521 --> 00:52:27,160
That's very distinct.

441
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:29,560
But that's what you're talking about.

442
00:52:29,801 --> 00:52:31,640
That's not that's not realistic at all.

443
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:39,680
Now the best uh could be hold that every sexuality if every situation also has some economic significance?

444
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,161
Yes.

445
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:46,000
And now it's become and presumably gastronomic and so forth.

446
00:52:46,001 --> 00:52:51,440
And because they're trying to be kind of other purposes, right?

447
00:52:52,401 --> 00:52:54,080
Is it originary in itself?

448
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:59,041
I mean, if it's a blend of the biological beach and the culture, right?

449
00:52:59,041 --> 00:53:01,840
So it would not be original as originary as a person.

450
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,041
That would be something.

451
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,521
So they're going to give me criteria or something, right?

452
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:15,200
And I'm an asking and asking, because then we can see whether sex was and economics was.

453
00:53:15,921 --> 00:53:20,480
And if that religion wasn't, for instance, then I'm going to understand something.

454
00:53:20,481 --> 00:53:24,881
And to say that in any situation something is behind them.

455
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:34,720
So the thing is, what you're trying to say is that maybe you should say that they're stressing particular parts on the nature of commandment.

456
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:35,360
That's right.

457
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:39,600
This is why you were saying that he was using this French-style quarrel.

458
00:53:39,921 --> 00:53:41,200
But I was coming back to that.

459
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:48,160
Yes, I think this is the background that Oli and I are sort of sharing that I'll mention.

460
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,760
Then Shakespeare has to talk.

461
00:53:49,760 --> 00:54:03,441
But just back in 1945, when this was read, no intellectual friends doubted that Florida Marx had understood something super deep, universal, important, and they couldn't buy anything without taking a stand.

462
00:54:03,521 --> 00:54:05,520
Like Marcuse was teaching that earlier, right?

463
00:54:05,521 --> 00:54:07,840
Like Marcuse who was teaching at Santa Cruz.

464
00:54:07,841 --> 00:54:09,521
But I'm sure there was somebody at Berkeley.

465
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,801
No, it's Henry Edith.

466
00:54:10,881 --> 00:54:12,881
But there was somebody here I'm sure teaching me it too.

467
00:54:12,881 --> 00:54:18,881
It isn't French, but it was these people who were in France, and that's why they had to take a statement on it.

468
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:29,001
And then Fukuca came along, I just called it in the question and said something like, but I just said, why should we believe that the atmosphere involved with sexual girl and food?

469
00:54:29,001 --> 00:54:33,720
Or he put it that way, but I mean, why should we believe this for a moment?

470
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:36,441
This whole thing is based on an assumption.

471
00:54:36,441 --> 00:54:38,441
Freud Marx does something right.

472
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,521
Let's figure out the wrong way.

473
00:54:41,001 --> 00:54:45,240
I think you're being responsible, but I will go further in it.

474
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:50,041
But if you're being privileged influenced by your frequentation of Fukushima response, which I don't see.

475
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,881
Yeah, yeah, but I shouldn't be talking about that.

476
00:54:51,881 --> 00:54:55,481
It's a blender talk, just people whoever has their hands on it.

477
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:07,080
I was wondering if there could be a background story that explains why the foreground or their significance here.

478
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:17,800
We mean the left being able to begin the 20th century or all the sexualized role in the food.

479
00:55:17,801 --> 00:55:20,680
But that would be the first.

480
00:55:20,841 --> 00:55:23,161
Okay, it's a great point.

481
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:28,600
Yeah, I think he meant towards this.

482
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:35,721
Well, obviously the fact that sexual genes is an atmosphere, perhaps understanding how you can integrate it into the background.

483
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,240
Intermingled, yeah, okay.

484
00:55:37,481 --> 00:55:37,881
That's right.

485
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,001
Yes.

486
00:55:39,321 --> 00:55:46,361
That's why all the dimensions are always too brilliant, even though there might be some one of them that could be more prominent depending on the situation.

487
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:51,881
Not meaning that you would have to concretely exclude the others, because I think it would be if you didn't believe in the background.

488
00:55:52,361 --> 00:55:53,001
Yeah.

489
00:55:53,001 --> 00:55:56,441
So I'm also trying to figure out exactly what to make of all this.

490
00:55:56,441 --> 00:56:03,161
And I think one thing that you might talk with the discussion that we've been having is to zoom out a bit and remember what the whole book is about.

491
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,680
So, and what is the home book about that?

492
00:56:05,841 --> 00:56:07,840
Well, and what does perception about that?

493
00:56:07,801 --> 00:56:15,441
Well, rather than answering your question, let me sort of put the way I was understanding of it and see if it makes sense to you.

494
00:56:16,321 --> 00:56:39,201
The one thing that I've been slowly getting convinced of as we've read the book, and that what you have said, today in particular, really I'm really convinced by is the idea that these accounts of perceptual consciousness, whether they're sort of reflective intellectualist understanding of consciousness or even the one that Albo mentioned earlier, can't make sense of the phenomenon of perception because they don't make sense of embodiment.

495
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:51,440
Now, when you start to take embodiment into account in different ways that we've discussed in the class, you have to start to consider all of the baggage that embodiment brings with it.

496
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:55,521
And one of the dimensions that it brings is the sexual dimension.

497
00:56:55,521 --> 00:57:02,881
So there is a way in which there's a strong claim that sexuality is an atmosphere for our whole existence.

498
00:57:03,521 --> 00:57:22,321
And that's important, in a way, I just wanted to revert in a book about perception, because if perception is going to be based not on one of these forms of consciousness, but rather on a kind of embodiment, which except then the sexual dimension of embodiment is going to also be starting to be available.

499
00:57:22,401 --> 00:57:22,961
Yeah, exactly.

500
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,320
And do we have to breathe, and do we have to be?

501
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:28,320
I mean, why does that equal privilege?

502
00:57:28,481 --> 00:57:29,120
That's the question.

503
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,760
Can I speak just to that really?

504
00:57:32,321 --> 00:57:45,200
There's wonderful passages on page 157 of the old edition that I'm reading where he talks about intentionality as a as a sort of within as having its own part of the intellectual art.

505
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,160
Sexual art is not an autonomous cycle, though.

506
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,680
It has internal links to the whole active and trouble with being.

507
00:57:53,401 --> 00:58:04,121
The claim that is made is that within the domain of the personal, there's three significant ways of relating to the world.

508
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,281
Not that one is more basic than the other.

509
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,320
There's knowing about the world, and that's hypothetical.

510
00:58:09,401 --> 00:58:10,280
That seems possible.

511
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,200
That seems possible.

512
00:58:14,041 --> 00:58:16,840
But the point is sexuality is a mode of pursuit.

513
00:58:16,841 --> 00:58:21,800
When you perceive things in a sexual way, then everything is colored by sex.

514
00:58:21,801 --> 00:58:25,961
And when you're not, there's no sense of, there's no sense of reduction to it.

515
00:58:25,961 --> 00:58:34,760
And by the way, this is the key answer to your question on people just that comes to standard.

516
00:58:34,841 --> 00:58:41,001
Is that sexuality is a mode of proceeding.

517
00:58:41,001 --> 00:58:51,080
And it's not the case that when you're engaged in impersonal or a pre-personal proceeding, that you're implicitly or impressively involved in sexual proceeding, no.

518
00:58:51,080 --> 00:59:00,041
But there is a way of relating to the world which is sexual, which is a mode of perceptual relationship to the world, and which is a component structure within the personal.

519
00:59:02,361 --> 00:59:06,121
All in this atmosphere of all that is.

520
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:17,961
Which means that you can't take away this dimension, or you couldn't assert that it's absolutely contingent or unnecessary more than about any other dimension.

521
00:59:17,961 --> 00:59:19,320
That's what you're going to remember.

522
00:59:20,921 --> 00:59:22,360
I'm going to say exactly what you say.

523
00:59:22,521 --> 00:59:25,080
I have a neighbor who experiences the world through grief.

524
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,720
I mean, she sees everything as a walking hand with her or whatever.

525
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:30,441
I mean, that's not her mode of structure, conscious structure.

526
00:59:30,841 --> 00:59:33,640
I think that's just something that you're instructing your worldview.

527
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,521
It could be the ridiculous facial way.

528
00:59:35,401 --> 00:59:41,120
But we've got it backwards.

529
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:50,560
The problem is to understand, the problem is to understand how having a concept and how sexuality could be.

530
00:59:50,881 --> 00:59:52,240
What is the exact question?

531
00:59:52,801 --> 00:59:57,120
We discovered both of the sexuality, one more form of original intentionality.

532
00:59:57,521 --> 00:59:58,961
That's what Christ is asking.

533
00:59:58,961 --> 01:00:02,560
How sexuality can be a form of intentional original?

534
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,200
Originally.

535
01:00:07,921 --> 01:00:09,120
No, no, no, no, no, no.

536
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:09,760
I don't know.

537
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:10,640
Of course not.

538
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:12,881
It means a sort.

539
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:14,160
It means a story.

540
01:00:15,441 --> 01:00:16,481
It doesn't mean general.

541
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,600
How can you be a force of intentionality?

542
01:00:19,841 --> 01:00:23,200
That is how it can be a loaded refugees of the world.

543
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,401
But in fact, what it is at all times are not.

544
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:30,720
It doesn't mean that it's that what determines what you're doing and dance.

545
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,001
Freedom comes into play.

546
01:00:32,801 --> 01:00:36,001
That's it's present as an atmosphere that you can ignore.

547
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:38,881
It cannot be the notes of what you're doing.

548
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:42,400
But why should I believe it's present as an atmosphere and not ignoring it?

549
01:00:42,401 --> 01:00:44,720
Why not just believe it's no more present as an atmosphere?

550
01:00:44,881 --> 01:00:45,441
That's cool.

551
01:00:45,521 --> 01:00:47,360
That's not the main credit of the chapters.

552
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,120
Some of the fraudulent claims.

553
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:56,720
You could delete that sentence in the chapter and find lose all the positives that I'm saying about other values of original source and detail.

554
01:00:56,881 --> 01:01:04,720
I believe it would finally be what takes its place in kind of making the sexual dimension more originary than the outer dimensions.

555
01:01:05,041 --> 01:01:05,760
That's the question.

556
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,521
But you can't explain.

557
01:01:07,841 --> 01:01:08,560
You can't explain.

558
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,481
Yeah, there's a part of the experience that you can't explain.

559
01:01:10,481 --> 01:01:10,960
That's it.

560
01:01:10,961 --> 01:01:11,360
No, no.

561
01:01:11,521 --> 01:01:13,200
I'm just going to say a bit more precisely.

562
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,640
You can't explain the sexuality to the world and truly.

563
01:01:18,401 --> 01:01:20,080
So it's the personal experience.

564
01:01:20,041 --> 01:01:20,921
But what's the problem?

565
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,920
Is it just the fact that he puts home sexuality as being in original dimension?

566
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:32,440
Because it's I mean it's obvious that in some some behaviors it's what comes into play first and foremost.

567
01:01:32,441 --> 01:01:33,800
That's about everything he's done.

568
01:01:35,881 --> 01:01:52,041
Some day you don't find explaining all uh at least of course but that's why I was but for I I I thought I was here that the fact that he wouldn't go as far as to say that the video is the thing that you would have to reduce everything to.

569
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:53,080
Okay, so he says this.

570
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:55,240
So he doesn't agree with FOIA, right?

571
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:56,200
Okay, right, right, right.

572
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,041
Which is pretty important to understand the chapter.

573
01:01:58,041 --> 01:02:12,120
And then the reason I said uh his brain and freedom comes to play is that you could say or you could disagree with the fact that there the other demotions are co-present in say an experience that that's not primarily sexual blazing.

574
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,200
Well then fine, you're doing something else.

575
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:21,160
Unless people draw away the line, which I don't think is so absolute, but at all times it's the atmosphere.

576
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,800
And that's a claim about the background.

577
01:02:24,441 --> 01:02:25,001
Yeah, why not?

578
01:02:25,001 --> 01:02:29,481
But think think of the fact that you might be you might be there for a reason that you don't even imagine.

579
01:02:29,481 --> 01:02:34,681
In this or that situation, say you're working down the street and then you're you you're going to the grocery store, right?

580
01:02:34,841 --> 01:02:36,280
To buy whatever.

581
01:02:36,841 --> 01:02:39,001
I think money dump people by what you're in.

582
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:44,361
And then you're trying to well then you begin you begin there's this sexual background that comes into your mind.

583
01:02:44,361 --> 01:02:46,360
So you you begin sensitizing whatever.

584
01:02:46,361 --> 01:02:52,441
And then if you use your mind that's not indicating that you can conclude that it was always already there.

585
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:59,400
That is, that it came into my mind shows that in every case it could have come into my mind, but it all detailed in the background.

586
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:00,360
You're really not.

587
01:03:00,361 --> 01:03:15,201
I mean, maybe that's true, but FOIA at least argument so that they're also specific when we say sexuality.

588
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:23,760
I think it'll help us understand the chapter when he says sexuality is general in sense of being all three declares of existence.

589
01:03:24,001 --> 01:03:34,080
While talking about the sexual intercourse or general organs or you know, our desire for sex, but it's like sexuality, I think it means the effect of life.

590
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:38,880
My question for you is: what do you think by the effect of life?

591
01:03:39,521 --> 01:03:41,760
Affected like what's in the beginning of the chapter.

592
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,800
Let me just read the variables.

593
01:03:50,401 --> 01:03:54,240
We then want to turn it like the first feature of the paragraph of the chapter.

594
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,680
Yeah, the end of the first paragraph.

595
01:03:55,921 --> 01:03:58,320
We then want to bring it along further genes for us.

596
01:03:58,321 --> 01:04:03,121
We want to find within that area of our experience, which clearly has significant reality only for us.

597
01:04:03,441 --> 01:04:05,201
And there is our effective life.

598
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:10,320
So I was trying to see how the figure genes begin to exist for us with desire for love and each other.

599
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,760
You know, you can dial things and being skinny in general.

600
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,201
Only point sensitive to the chapter.

601
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,880
And the second sentence is important too.

602
01:04:18,881 --> 01:04:29,440
Ordinarily, affectivity is conceived as a motivation of effective states of players and pain, each stealing within itself, usually incomprehensible and inflictable only into the body of the system.

603
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:32,720
In that simply referring to the sexual habits, okay, so you mean it's not a good idea.

604
01:04:32,881 --> 01:04:36,240
No, no, that the second sentence that you write is an account that you completely reject.

605
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,041
And here's what?

606
01:04:37,041 --> 01:04:39,441
It's an account that you complete your rejects.

607
01:04:39,441 --> 01:04:41,600
Or the second paragraph is positively rejected.

608
01:04:47,361 --> 01:04:49,521
So it's it's what's related to sexuality.

609
01:04:49,521 --> 01:05:06,521
But you one thing you're supposed to say that um Then he goes on and says if you like he doesn't say that has to be related to a sexual half.

610
01:05:06,521 --> 01:05:09,960
You know, right in fact they're talking about the sexuality.

611
01:05:10,041 --> 01:05:17,560
It's funny your desires and your what I don't see what this is.

612
01:05:18,041 --> 01:05:30,120
I think it's actually a more general concept that isn't applicable to values in general, not all three dimensions of that.

613
01:05:35,801 --> 01:05:44,521
I think that there's a specialized case that goes right into Agenstein's sexuality and then he goes into void and then goes like a bin style.

614
01:05:44,521 --> 01:05:46,441
You don't get anything about any other activities.

615
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,001
But the point is not that Schneider can't have sex.

616
01:05:49,961 --> 01:05:51,880
The point is not that Schneider can't have sex.

617
01:05:52,041 --> 01:05:53,481
The point is that he can't feel desire.

618
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,320
No attractiveness, that's the point.

619
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:06,760
So the examples in this chapter are of women.

620
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,240
But you can't perceive them as attractive.

621
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:11,800
You can't perceive them as attractive as sexual.

622
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:13,160
It's a vote of perception.

623
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:17,640
It's a kind of perception that isn't explicable in terms of pre-personal perception.

624
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:19,320
I don't know what we're disagreeing about now.

625
01:06:19,321 --> 01:06:21,961
It's actually a kind of perception, the homosexual perception.

626
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:23,080
Okay.

627
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:35,001
But then you can goes back and I think if he if you did what he's wanting you to do, I think it would be a much more interesting challenge and he talks to be talking about I think all the families kind of and that's the process.

628
01:06:35,001 --> 01:07:08,881
I think the first thing the rest of the program maybe the and uh totally total access point you know if I you know but then that everything is totally unconscious we don't have total so we don't have anything but uh in access to it.

629
01:07:08,881 --> 01:07:14,001
So taking this program so what is the notion of responsibility, right?

630
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:24,481
He talks about the guys who are okay.
