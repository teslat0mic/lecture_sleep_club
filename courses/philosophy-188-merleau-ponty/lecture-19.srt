1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,921
So, what I'm going to do is just try to start off by setting up what I think is the dialectic in this chapter and try to give you a sense of what the phenomenon is that Merlot Fonti is interested in in this chapter.

2
00:00:17,921 --> 00:00:25,521
What do you think the two kinds of wrong views are that you can have about how to account for the phenomenon?

3
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:36,961
And then try to start to say something today and hopefully say a little bit more next time about what the right thing is to say about the phenomenology.

4
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:45,041
Bert said that this is probably one of the most important chapters in the book, and I think that's right.

5
00:00:45,040 --> 00:01:02,080
I think this is really the chapter where you get what I think of as the essential phenomenon being perceptual experience, the experience of object, one of the most basic things that you can talk about when you're talking about perceptual resilience.

6
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:16,400
And Merlot Fomchy thinks that's a key to the experience of objects, is a phenomenon that he calls right at the beginning of the chapter the phenomenon of perceptual constancy.

7
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,961
Right at the opening, right at the opening paragraph of the chapter.

8
00:01:20,961 --> 00:01:25,441
I have, unfortunately, an old copy of the book, but Bert tells me you have a concordance.

9
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,721
Yeah, I'm saying anything.

10
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,161
Okay, so this is easy.

11
00:01:30,161 --> 00:01:40,161
We don't even need the concordance for this, but the the very first sentence of the chapter, whatever page that is for you guys, 290.

12
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:41,560
Sorry, not the old one.

13
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,520
299 in in the old copy.

14
00:01:47,081 --> 00:01:48,040
348.

15
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:49,000
348.

16
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:49,640
Okay.

17
00:01:49,641 --> 00:02:02,120
So just the opening the opening paragraph says a thing has characteristics or properties, quote unquote, for both of these, which are stable even if they don't entirely serve to define it.

18
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:14,521
And we propose to approach the phenomenon of reality, the phenomenon of what there is, the phenomenon of what exists for us to have experiences of, by studying perceptual constants.

19
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:24,040
A thing has, in the first place, its size and its shape throughout variations of perspective which are merely apparent.

20
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:33,160
We don't attribute these appearances to the object itself, but regard them as accidental features of our relations with it and not as being of it.

21
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:41,081
What we do mean by this and on what basis, what do we mean by this, and on what basis do we judge that form or size are the form and the size of the object.

22
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:43,800
So what he's talking about here is the idea.

23
00:02:43,801 --> 00:03:04,440
It's a well-known idea, known to psychologists from the middle of the 19th century, that when I see an object, I see it to have a constant size and a constant shape, I'm sorry, a constant color throughout variations in the context in which it's presented to me.

24
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,361
So it looks to be the same size throughout variations in my distance to it.

25
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:15,641
As I walk closer to you and further away from you, it doesn't look like you grow.

26
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:18,280
You look to remain the same size.

27
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:29,521
And as I take an object and I rotate it with respect to me, as I take this book and I rotate it with respect to me, it doesn't look like the shape of the object changes.

28
00:03:29,521 --> 00:03:32,880
It looks like the shape of the object remains the same.

29
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:52,641
And with respect to color, as the lighting context changes, as the lights get dimmer or brighter, as I take an object inside or outside, it doesn't look like the color of the object changes, despite the fact that the context in which it's presented to me does change.

30
00:03:52,641 --> 00:04:05,440
And the way Mellow Holmes characterizes this is he says the object has, in the first place, its size and its shape and its color for variations.

31
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:13,761
Now, you might think this is the first strange fact about our experience of objects.

32
00:04:13,761 --> 00:04:30,881
You might think it's a strange fact because it turns out that as the context in which an object is presented to me, the image that's projected from the object onto my retina changes dramatically.

33
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:35,201
So think about the very simple case of the size of an object.

34
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:49,201
As I walk closer to the door, the size of the image that the door projects onto my retina grows, and it grows correlative to the distance between me and the door.

35
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:57,681
So perceptual experience is related in any sort of obvious way to the image that's passed onto the retina.

36
00:04:57,681 --> 00:05:03,280
You'd have expected that as I walk closer to the door, it looks like the door gets bigger.

37
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,201
It would look like the door gets bigger.

38
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:10,400
And psychologists in the 19th century were confused about why that didn't happen.

39
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:17,881
I mean, if the image grows as I get closer, how come it doesn't look like the object grows?

40
00:05:17,881 --> 00:05:23,961
If the image passed onto the retina from the object grows, why doesn't it look like the object grows?

41
00:05:23,961 --> 00:05:45,800
And you remember all the way back in the sort of introduction to the phenomenology of perception, Melfonte said the idea that the features of the experience are correlated with the features of the retinal image is what he called the constancy hypothesis.

42
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:53,001
And that's a hypothesis that psychologists have always found, have often found natural, and certainly in the 19th century they found natural.

43
00:05:53,400 --> 00:06:05,641
And if you find that hypothesis natural, then there's going to be a problem about why it is that when the features of the image change, it's not the case with the features of the experienced object.

44
00:06:05,641 --> 00:06:08,280
So that's a problem.

45
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,720
That's a sort of natural problem for psychologists to think about.

46
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:23,480
And of course, the standard structure for chapter and meloponte, insofar as we can talk about these things as having structure, they do wander quite a lot.

47
00:06:23,641 --> 00:06:42,360
But the standard structure for a chapter in Melochonte, and it's true about this chapter also, that Meloponty is going to go through and say, well, here's how a certain kind of empiricist tries to account for this phenomenon and what's wrong with it, why it misses some aspect of the phenomenology of our experience of size, company.

48
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:54,201
Here's how a standard intellectualist like Kant or Helmholtz or someone like that tries to account for the phenomenon, what's wrong with it, what's wrong with that account, what ignites is.

49
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:58,400
And then here's what the right kind of phenomenological accounts ought to say.

50
00:06:57,881 --> 00:07:00,961
So I'm going to try to take you through some of those.

51
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:13,600
Well, okay, so right at the beginning of the chapter, Melopolty talks about the empiricist account of perceptual constants.

52
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:19,121
So there's, I want to say something briefly about two different kinds of empiricist accounts.

53
00:07:19,121 --> 00:07:29,840
One that Meloponty doesn't mention, but might be relevant for people who've done a little bit of analytic philosophy of mind or sort of history of analytic philosophy.

54
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,881
And then one, a kind of empiricist account that Melopolty does talk about.

55
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,001
That's due to a 19th century German psychologist named Joel Herring.

56
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:59,440
So the first account that I want to say something about is an empiricist account that you find, a kind of sense data theory, that you find defended by lots of sense data theorists, but maybe most famously by Bertrand Russell in Problems of Philosophy, this book of his from say 19.

57
00:07:59,441 --> 00:08:12,641
So this kind of empiricist account, an empiricist like Russell, a sense data theorist like Ruffle, because what it is to have perceptual experiences of the world is to be presented with sense data.

58
00:08:12,641 --> 00:08:25,441
And sense data have this feature, namely, everything that you, every feature that you think a sense data has, it does have.

59
00:08:25,441 --> 00:08:29,361
And you couldn't be wrong about what those features are.

60
00:08:29,681 --> 00:08:41,681
And in particular, Russell thinks that the features of the sense data are correlated in some pretty close fashion with something like features of the retinal image.

61
00:08:41,681 --> 00:08:45,161
So Russell takes a case in the problems of philosophy.

62
00:08:45,161 --> 00:08:49,561
I don't have it with me, otherwise I would read it right here in the beginning in chapter 2.

63
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:55,641
He also takes a case of what we would think of as color constancy.

64
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:01,481
He says, look at that table over there that's sort of slightly unevenly lit.

65
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:10,441
Well, a natural thing to say about that table, says Russell, is that it is that it looks like it's got a constant color.

66
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:20,761
It's a single color, brown, or this wall is a single color, white, this wall here, but it looks like it is a single color.

67
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:31,641
But Russell says if you're a sense data theorist, you realize that that's not actually right, because if you look closely enough, you'll find that it doesn't appear to be a single color.

68
00:09:31,641 --> 00:09:36,921
It looks different with respect to color in different lighting contents.

69
00:09:36,921 --> 00:09:42,840
It looks a little bit more yellow over there and a little bit more gray over there.

70
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:50,760
And Russell Peth, that's what we know is true, because after all, that's true as a matter of the features of the retinal image.

71
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:58,600
I mean, the wavelength of the light that's reflected off the wall there is different from the wavelength of the light that's reflected off the wall there.

72
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,081
And there are different sense data that go along with it.

73
00:10:01,081 --> 00:10:11,961
So Russell Peth, although you might have thought it was natural to say that I experience the color of the wall to be the same throughout variations in lighting content, as a matter of fact, that's false.

74
00:10:11,961 --> 00:10:14,361
I don't have that experience.

75
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:24,600
But the right thing to say about this case, according to Russell, is that I believe that the wall is a constant color throughout variation.

76
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,801
So it's not that I have an experience of the color of the wall as constant.

77
00:10:27,641 --> 00:10:32,240
I just have a belief.

78
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,481
So here's a case where we have a funny situation.

79
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:43,840
There's Russell's strategy is just to deny the phenomenology.

80
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:50,000
His strategy is just to say that's not really, you thought that was the way it seemed to you, but you weren't really right.

81
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,321
If you look carefully enough, what you discover is that, no, it actually looks a different color there than it does.

82
00:10:56,321 --> 00:11:22,641
Now, one of the interesting things about this is that although Russell is driven to deny the phenomenology as a result of this sort of pre-theoretical commitment about what the experience has to be, because of his pre-theoretical commitment to the sense data, it turns out that it's pretty easy to argue against Russell's view.

83
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,561
So let me say again what the view is and see if anyone has an idea how you might argue against it.

84
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:37,601
The view again is that it's not that I don't experience the color of the wall to be constant throughout variation in writing.

85
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,880
I just believe it.

86
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:45,840
And it's that belief that I mistake for the experience of color and constancy.

87
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,321
Can anyone think of a way you might argue?

88
00:11:48,321 --> 00:11:49,681
Yeah, give it a shot.

89
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:51,921
Okay, so that's an interesting question, right?

90
00:11:51,921 --> 00:12:05,041
That's the question, and an empiricist might be interested in that kind of response, because empiricists do generally, I think that the thoughts that I have about the way things are come out of the more basic experiences.

91
00:12:05,321 --> 00:12:09,760
So, and that'll point to the fact that there's a kind of inconsistency in Russell.

92
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:18,760
He thinks we get our, as an empiricist, he might think we get our thoughts from our experiences, but here's a belief that doesn't seem to be connected to our underlying experiences.

93
00:12:19,561 --> 00:12:22,201
But that doesn't seem, I mean, maybe you can tell some story.

94
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:27,161
Maybe I just happen to have prior beliefs that objects have constant properties.

95
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:32,600
And so it's that that gives me this sort of in general belief about color constants.

96
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:35,081
He might be able to patch it up a little bit.

97
00:12:35,081 --> 00:12:38,361
It would divorce it from a kind of Humean empiricism.

98
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,561
But try another one.

99
00:12:39,561 --> 00:12:39,961
Yeah.

100
00:12:40,281 --> 00:12:40,680
Good.

101
00:12:40,681 --> 00:12:41,640
Okay, so that's true.

102
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:44,520
He tells us, so that's a kind of phenomenological argument.

103
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,521
That's the kind of argument that a Husserl or a Merlot Ponti might give.

104
00:12:48,520 --> 00:13:00,681
They would say, well, geez, what's happening here is you're reading your pre-theoretical commitments into the description of the experience and telling us what it must be like rather than paying attention to it.

105
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:01,641
So that's right.

106
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:05,721
But the problem is that Russell could just say, no, I'm not.

107
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,600
Could he just sort of say, I am not.

108
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,441
That's really the way it looks to me.

109
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:11,641
Dog on it.

110
00:13:11,961 --> 00:13:13,561
Or he could say that.

111
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:19,801
And the difficulty is that if he says that, it's a little hard to know how we're supposed to proceed.

112
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,521
Any other ideas?

113
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,400
Yeah, one more.

114
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:30,360
I'm going to believe you want to cause our needs.

115
00:13:31,081 --> 00:13:32,520
That's an interesting thought.

116
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,001
That might be like the first idea.

117
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:50,441
So in other words, if it's really true that our thoughts about the way things are are grounded in our experiences, how come we have different thoughts when, in some cases, and they don't correlate properly with the experience?

118
00:13:50,441 --> 00:13:54,041
But he might be able to patch, he might be able to patch it up in a sort of way.

119
00:13:54,041 --> 00:14:00,961
He might say, well, we have background sort of knowledge about the way the world is, and that's what's giving us these beliefs.

120
00:14:01,281 --> 00:14:02,801
But there's a but how about this?

121
00:13:57,801 --> 00:14:05,201
I mean, there's this sort of interesting fact.

122
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:12,721
It turns out that it doesn't really matter what my beliefs are about the way the world is.

123
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,281
My experiences are just much more robust than my beliefs.

124
00:14:17,281 --> 00:14:27,441
So for instance, I could have the experience that I have of this wall as being a constant color, no matter what beliefs I have about it.

125
00:14:27,441 --> 00:14:38,881
I mean, suppose I know that I'm in a very funny sort of laboratory experiment, where as a matter of fact, that wall really is radically different shades of colors.

126
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:42,001
Red over there, and green over there, and yellow over there.

127
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:52,241
But for whatever, I'm sort of tripped and it's an illusion, and it looks to me the way it does, namely it looks to me to have a constant color.

128
00:14:52,240 --> 00:15:05,360
It seems that no matter how much I believe that the colors are different as the lighting context changes, I continue to have the experience of the thing as constantly colored.

129
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:20,081
And if Russell thinks that the way you account for the experience is by saying, well, it's just a belief that I have, then it ought to be the case that whenever I change beliefs, I'll change experiences.

130
00:15:20,081 --> 00:15:22,801
But that doesn't seem to happen.

131
00:15:23,201 --> 00:15:30,081
So it looks like the experience is more robust than and can learn independent of the beliefs that we have about the ways.

132
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:36,721
It seems like a reason not to think that that kind of empiricist account is a very good one.

133
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,201
But it's not a phenomenological reason.

134
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:44,041
And maybe that's why Venelopolzi doesn't consider the Russellian account.

135
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:48,920
But Van Lopony does consider another kind of account by Gould Herring.

136
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:57,241
He's talking about it in the second paragraph of the paper, of this chapter, sorry.

137
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:25,801
So, right in the second paragraph, right after where we left off leaving on 299 in the old book, which is always 348, still 348, he says, what's presented to us in the case of each object, the psychologist will assert, psychologists here means the empirical, are sizes and shapes which always vary with the perspective.

138
00:16:25,801 --> 00:16:37,881
And it's conventional to regard as true the size which the object has when within reach, or the shape which it assumes when it's in a plane parallel to the frontal elevation.

139
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,241
So the shape that it has when it's presented face on.

140
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,561
These are, okay, so let's say that.

141
00:16:45,561 --> 00:16:49,161
Now, here's an account that you could give of that sort.

142
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,800
Here's an account, I won't read it, I'll just give it to you.

143
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,681
Here's an account that you could give of this sort that Herring does give.

144
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:26,040
And the account goes like this: it says, Well, it's true that when the context changes, when I get closer, say, to the door, something changes, namely, you know, a different retinal image is projected, but I still have an experience of the door as the same height, as the same size.

145
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:46,480
Now, so an empiricist like Herring, who wants to try to account for that phenomenon, will say, well, okay, what's going on there is that the true size, as he says in this sentence that I just read, the true size is the size of the object when I'm standing normal distance to it.

146
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,161
Maybe that, and what the normal distance is, is the conventional one.

147
00:17:50,161 --> 00:17:57,520
It's the one that when the object is within reach or when I can do the normal thing with the object and so on.

148
00:17:57,841 --> 00:18:06,800
And the true size is the size of the object as I experience it to be when I'm that distance from it.

149
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,240
So what happens when I'm some other distance from it?

150
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:34,000
Well, the Herring kind of empiricist will say, when I'm further away, what I do is I replace the experience of the size of the door that I'm having from this distance too far away with my memory of what the size was when I was the appropriate distance, when I was the true distance from it.

151
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,480
Okay?

152
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:51,681
So that's a, well, the reason I have this experience of constancy is that when I'm an inappropriate distance from the object, I just replace the experience I'm now having with the experience I normally have, the experience of it at the appropriate.

153
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:00,161
Okay, well what do you think that's an account that really gets an important fact about the phenomenology wrong?

154
00:19:01,121 --> 00:19:05,920
Can anyone say anything about what that fact might be?

155
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,201
What that fact about melanology is?

156
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,641
Suppose it's really true.

157
00:19:10,641 --> 00:19:12,921
Here I am, I'm right up here.

158
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,400
I'm looking at the size of the door.

159
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:30,360
And the reason the door looks to be the very same size as it did when I was back here is that, well, when I'm up here, I'm just, I'm actually having the very same experience that I had when I was back here.

160
00:19:30,681 --> 00:19:41,080
I'm replacing the experience that I have of it up close with my memory of the experience that I had of it when I was back here.

161
00:19:41,401 --> 00:19:42,521
How does that sound?

162
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,361
Does that get the phenomenology right?

163
00:19:44,681 --> 00:19:52,520
The part about the temporality that I feel like I reiterated, but it's sort of more continuously flowing than it's hard to imagine.

164
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,201
Okay.

165
00:19:54,201 --> 00:20:02,360
So, but I, but I think temporality may come in as further down the line, but I don't think we even need to get that complicated.

166
00:20:02,921 --> 00:20:07,401
I mean, just imagine you could instantaneously go from here to there.

167
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:15,480
Is it a very good account of the way the size of the door looks when I'm close up like this?

168
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:21,320
That it looks exactly the same as it looks with respect to size when I'm back here.

169
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,760
Okay, good, right.

170
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,961
It doesn't take into account any contextual features at all.

171
00:20:25,961 --> 00:20:30,040
In particular, it doesn't take into account the distance to the object.

172
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:34,120
And what you'd like to say is that, no, it's just not true.

173
00:20:34,121 --> 00:20:38,201
It's true that the door looks to be the same size.

174
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,640
It looks like it hasn't changed with respect to size.

175
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:45,401
The size that it looks, I don't experience it the same way.

176
00:20:45,401 --> 00:20:57,881
I mean, now, we don't know how to say, how to characterize that difference, but it does seem right to say it's just not true that my experience of the size of the door is exactly the same when I'm...

177
00:20:59,361 --> 00:21:11,841
So we need to make a distinction, says Merloponcy, between the size the object looks to be.

178
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,360
That's one thing.

179
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:18,800
And that is what remains constant throughout variation.

180
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,961
Again, we have size, shape, color, different contextual variations.

181
00:21:24,961 --> 00:21:32,720
The size or shape or color that the object looks to be, that remains constant throughout contextual variation.

182
00:21:33,681 --> 00:21:35,201
That's one thing.

183
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,000
But there's something else, too, that's really a part of the experience.

184
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,880
And that's what Merloponcy calls the way the size looks.

185
00:21:47,201 --> 00:21:55,840
So the way the size of an object looks really does change as I get closer to it or further away from it.

186
00:21:56,161 --> 00:22:01,120
Despite the fact that the size it looks to be doesn't change.

187
00:22:01,681 --> 00:22:02,321
Let's see.

188
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:12,560
I was going to find the best passage where he makes so I'm now about seven sentences into the second paragraph.

189
00:22:12,641 --> 00:22:14,560
I'm still on 299.

190
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,240
You guys might have turned the page.

191
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:16,640
I'm not sure.

192
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,321
I'm still on 348, actually.

193
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:18,801
Okay.

194
00:22:20,321 --> 00:22:26,161
What he says is now in 299, five lines from the bottom.

195
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,000
But this but this, well, he gives the, well, okay.

196
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:57,800
But this psychological reconstitution of objective size or shape takes for granted what has been to be characterization of objective size or shape takes for granted what has to be explained.

197
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:08,120
namely a gamut of determinate sizes and shapes from which it is sufficient to select one as the real size or shape.

198
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:12,600
This is slightly complicated to explain, but I think I have to do it.

199
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:30,840
So what he's imagining is that you have a determinate set of objective sizes of the door, one as seen from here, one as seen from here, one as seen from here, and so on.

200
00:23:30,841 --> 00:23:39,961
And all you have to do in giving your psychological account of the phenomenon of size constancy is pick which one of those is the true size.

201
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,161
Which one is it?

202
00:23:41,161 --> 00:23:48,361
Well, it's the one that you're presented with when you're at the appropriate distance, whatever that is, the conventional distance.

203
00:23:48,681 --> 00:23:51,640
That's the true size, according to Heron.

204
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,520
And you just select one of those.

205
00:23:54,921 --> 00:24:03,961
And when you've got that, that's the one that characterizes the experience that you have of the size of the object no matter what the context is.

206
00:24:04,601 --> 00:24:13,961
And he says that that presupposes the idea that you've already got these determinate experiences of the size of the object.

207
00:24:13,961 --> 00:24:35,360
Now, Melbourne, in this chapter, and in many other places, I'm sure you've seen this already, thinks that it's characteristic of almost all of our perceptual experience that it's not an indeterminate nature, that there's something essentially indeterminate about everyday lived perceptual experience.

208
00:24:35,361 --> 00:24:41,760
And that one of the things that's missing in the empiricist account of Herring is that it misses the indeterminacy.

209
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:57,840
And the indeterminacy in this case is the fact that the tension between the fact that although the size looks to be constant, some in some sense or other, the way that size is experienced by me changes.

210
00:24:57,841 --> 00:25:06,480
We need to do more to spell out what that way is, what it is, or the way of a size to look.

211
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:21,441
But the essential indeterminacy in the experience of constant sizes comes from the tension between these two things, the fact that the size that it looks to be remains constant and the way the size looks.

212
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:31,120
Typical kind of phenomenological argument that Meloponte will give against an empiricist kind of view.

213
00:25:31,121 --> 00:25:31,600
Yeah.

214
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,760
I'm curious to know how the determinate, indeterminate comes into play here.

215
00:25:37,841 --> 00:25:54,480
Because it seems like somebody like Gibson, who as far as I recall, doesn't really have anything about this indeterminate, determinate distinction, which really is important from the world, could accept this distinction without accounting for it in a way which demands an explanation in terms of the determinate and indeterminate.

216
00:25:54,881 --> 00:26:07,760
I think properly understood, we'll see that Gibson does really have an essential place for what I think of as indeterminacy in the Merlopontean sense.

217
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,560
Indeterminacy, in sort of shorthand, affordances are indeterminate.

218
00:26:11,441 --> 00:26:19,320
Gibsonian kinds of affordances are indeterminate in the Mero-Ponte sense.

219
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,000
And that'll become clearer once I spell out what it means.

220
00:26:23,161 --> 00:26:26,201
Okay, so that's a classic kind of phenomenological argument.

221
00:26:26,201 --> 00:26:33,001
Here's the empiricist account of this phenomenon: size, constancy, shape, constancy, color, constancy.

222
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,400
Here's the empiricist account.

223
00:26:35,401 --> 00:26:50,681
And look, lo and behold, if you pay proper attention to the phenomenology, you'll notice that there's an essential feature of the experience, of the phenomenology of the experience, that's lacking in this Herring kind of empiricist account.

224
00:26:50,681 --> 00:26:58,441
It can't make the distinction between the size the object looks to be and the way that size looks and then occurs.

225
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:04,360
And that really is an essential distinction that's part of the phenomenology that you need to account for.

226
00:27:04,361 --> 00:27:25,000
So if it's true, and I guess prove that what the psychologist ought to be explaining is how is the phenomenology as we really experience it, then the empiricist account fails completely because it fails to make an essential distinction that's part of the phenomenon.

227
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,601
So there's a way you could think of it.

228
00:27:26,601 --> 00:27:30,201
You can think, the phenomenology is the data.

229
00:27:30,201 --> 00:27:39,161
If you're interested in the relation between phenomenology and psychological explanation or phenomenology and neuroscientific explanation, here's a proposal.

230
00:27:39,961 --> 00:27:46,681
The phenomenology is the data that the psychologist and the neuroscientists need to try to account for.

231
00:27:46,681 --> 00:27:54,121
And often Merloponte's criticisms of psychological or neuroscientific accounts take the form that we've just seen.

232
00:27:54,121 --> 00:27:59,681
Their criticism of saying, well, you give an explanation that depends on a misreading of the phenomenology.

233
00:27:59,681 --> 00:28:07,120
And in particular, it's an explanation that can't make a crucial, that can't account for a crucial phenomenological.

234
00:28:07,121 --> 00:28:11,120
Okay, so those are two kinds of empiricist accounts.

235
00:28:11,841 --> 00:28:18,080
One that Mellow Homke doesn't talk about, the Russell kind, that just denies there's any phenomenology at all.

236
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,160
So since it denies there's any phenomenology at all, we know we're in a weird area.

237
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,560
We can't really use phenomenological arguments to argue against Russell, because we've got to find something else.

238
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,921
But now here's Herring.

239
00:28:27,921 --> 00:28:28,961
He's got the phenomenon.

240
00:28:28,961 --> 00:28:31,760
He's got an account of the phenomenology.

241
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,921
And he's trying to give a psychological explanation for why it is the way it is.

242
00:28:35,921 --> 00:28:39,041
And it just turns out the explanation doesn't explain what needs to be.

243
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:41,760
But now we get to a harder case.

244
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:48,320
The harder case is the intellectualist or the modern-day cognitivist.

245
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,480
And I'm going to give two different kinds of intellectualists also.

246
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,681
The intellectualist is harder for at least two reasons.

247
00:28:59,681 --> 00:29:04,320
One is it's often hard to identify in the text.

248
00:29:04,961 --> 00:29:12,080
It turns out that the intellectualist is usually a lot closer to Merlophonte's position than the empiricist.

249
00:29:12,401 --> 00:29:20,961
And often it really looks like when Mero-Pompty is describing the intellectualist account on a certain phenomenon, he's endorsing it.

250
00:29:20,961 --> 00:29:38,560
And it really looks like that's going on in the next paragraph, which is the paragraph that begins, there would seem, at least at first glance, to be a way of evading the question, namely, that must be, that's on 300 in my old version, must be on 349 or something.

251
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:43,320
That's where the accounts of the intellectualist starts.

252
00:29:42,641 --> 00:29:49,641
And about two-thirds of the way through the paragraph, you're thinking, boy, this sounds pretty good.

253
00:29:49,961 --> 00:29:51,961
And I'm hoping it doesn't sound pretty good.

254
00:29:51,961 --> 00:29:54,681
It sounds like Merlin Holtzy thinks it's pretty good.

255
00:29:54,921 --> 00:30:10,681
I mean, he really goes on for quite a while speaking sort of in an apparently sort of, I mean, it looks like he's endorsing the view, but he's not actually endorsing the view.

256
00:30:10,681 --> 00:30:15,560
So how does the intellectualist account go?

257
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:23,480
Well, the intellectualist, the good thing about the intellectualist is that he starts by making this distinction.

258
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:33,000
The distinction between the size or shape or color that an object looks to be and the way that size looks in the current context.

259
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:49,880
In order to make that distinction, it turns out, you have to admit, and the intellectualist does, and Merrill Faulty thinks it's right to, you have to admit that the subject, in some sense or another, takes account of the contextual variations.

260
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:58,760
So the subject, in some sense or another, when looking at the size of an object, takes into account the distance to it.

261
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:18,441
Now, the famous kind of contemporary cognitivist accounts, like accounts from psychologist Irving and Irv Rock, are called in the literature taking into account accounts of perceptual constancy.

262
00:31:18,441 --> 00:31:46,480
So Irv Rock has an account of taking into account accounts of perceptual constancy, where he says, look, the important thing to notice about the experience of the size of an object is not that the experience of the size of the object correlates with the size of the retinal image projected from the object onto the retina.

263
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,681
That's not true.

264
00:31:47,681 --> 00:31:49,681
We all know that's not true.

265
00:31:49,681 --> 00:32:03,280
But what is true, they notice, is that there's a constant relation between the size of the image that's projected onto the retina and the distance to the object.

266
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:08,560
So that as I get closer, the image gets larger.

267
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,880
And as I get further away, the image gets smaller.

268
00:32:12,881 --> 00:32:19,600
But the ratio between the distance to the object and the size of the image is constant.

269
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:27,681
So in sort of mathematical terms, there's a linear correlation between the distance to the object and the size.

270
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:28,961
Okay.

271
00:32:28,961 --> 00:32:31,441
So that's a true fact.

272
00:32:31,441 --> 00:32:34,320
That's a true fact about our experience.

273
00:32:34,641 --> 00:32:49,840
And what you might think then is that that means that the subject, in some sense, takes into account the distance to the object in having the experience of the size of the object.

274
00:32:50,161 --> 00:33:03,040
It's true about color constancy also, as there's a sort of constant correlation between the light that's projected off the retina and this rounded lighting concept.

275
00:33:03,201 --> 00:33:06,001
It's true about shape constancy.

276
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,720
There's a constant correlation between, and so on.

277
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,600
Okay, so you have, but size of these, there's this thing.

278
00:33:11,681 --> 00:33:12,400
Constant correlation.

279
00:33:12,441 --> 00:33:22,120
So you have a mathematical account of how it is, apparently, how it is that we have this phenomenon of size constant.

280
00:33:22,121 --> 00:33:28,521
So Merlopunke's describing this in the beginning of his third paragraph.

281
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:46,040
He says, there would seem, at least at first glance, to be a way of evading the question, namely by conceding that it's in fact never the case that size and shape are perceived as attributes of a single object, and that they're simply names for the relations between the parts of the phenomenal field.

282
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:59,561
In this case, the constancy of the real size or shape, which is maintained through the varying perspectives, is merely the constancy in the relations between the phenomenon and the conditions accompanying this presentation.

283
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:04,841
So the conditions accompanying this presentation, in the case of size constantly, just distance.

284
00:34:05,401 --> 00:34:12,760
And there's a constant relation, there's a constant ratio between the distance from the object and the size of the image that it projects.

285
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:17,561
This well-known mathematical fact, psychophysics know all about them.

286
00:34:17,881 --> 00:34:20,920
But you might think that's what's going on.

287
00:34:20,921 --> 00:34:39,561
You might think that what it is to have an experience of the size of an object as constant throughout variations in the distance to it is for me constantly to be taking into account how far away I am and somehow using that to give me the experience of the size of the object.

288
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,201
Now there's two different things you might think are going on.

289
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:52,921
One is one that Merlopunty doesn't talk about, but it really is sort of the most prominent contemporary kind of account.

290
00:34:53,560 --> 00:35:02,801
You might think that what's going on is that it's not me as the perceiving subject, but it's somehow my brain.

291
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:06,480
It's a subconscious thing, some personal thing, right?

292
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:22,881
And nowadays in psychology, there are lots of mathematical psychologists and mathematical neuroscience, computational neuroscientists, who are busy trying to give accounts of the functions, the mathematical functions that the brain has to be calculating or computing in order to give rise to these experiences.

293
00:35:23,281 --> 00:35:28,320
And here's one, easy mathematical functions, the ratio between distance and image.

294
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:46,720
So if that's right, I suppose it is true that the brain has, in some sense or another, a representation of the distance through an object or it may, and a representation of the size of the image that's projected from the object onto the retina.

295
00:35:46,721 --> 00:35:49,601
And it can just do a sort of long division, right?

296
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:54,640
And you get a constant, when you got, since you get a constant ratio, it says, aha, six feet.

297
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,280
That's how big you should experience it to be, right?

298
00:35:57,281 --> 00:35:58,640
No matter how far away you are.

299
00:35:58,881 --> 00:36:03,921
I'm now seven feet away from it, and it still looks to be six feet because the image is projected.

300
00:36:03,921 --> 00:36:12,641
And so that might be, that might be a good account of what's going on in the brain, maybe.

301
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:17,601
But it's not a good account of what's going on experientially.

302
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:22,320
It's not a good account of the phenomenology of size constant.

303
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:39,040
And I probably, I think I'd like to suggest that, insofar as it's not a good account of the phenomenology of seismic constancy, it's probably not a very great place to look for an account of what's going on in the brain either, though there's a contingent relation between those.

304
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,881
And it might turn out that this kind of computational account really is what's going on.

305
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:54,121
By the way, there's all sorts of ways, psychologists claim, that we might get to have a sub-personal representation of the distance to an object.

306
00:36:54,120 --> 00:37:03,081
There's binocular disparity, the fact that my eyes, since they're not in the same place, have to come to focus on an object.

307
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:07,881
And it's a different thing to focus on an object that's farther away.

308
00:37:07,881 --> 00:37:13,161
My eyes will be closer to parallel than it is to focus on an object that's close up.

309
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:28,200
And since there's a correlation between how much frost my eyes are and how far away the object is that they're focusing on, that might be a clue about for my brain about what the distance to the object is.

310
00:37:28,361 --> 00:37:36,760
Then I can just get that number, say 13 feet, and plug it into the computer in there, and then I've got the size of the retinal image.

311
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,601
So the psychologists have got a kind of an account to it.

312
00:37:42,921 --> 00:37:53,801
But what doesn't seem to be right is that that's a very good characterization of the way in which I experience the distance to an object.

313
00:37:54,120 --> 00:38:05,160
What doesn't seem to be right is that that's a very good characterization of the way in which I experience the distance from the object, or even for that matter, the way in which I experience the size of.

314
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,401
Ask yourself this question.

315
00:38:07,401 --> 00:38:16,361
When I look at an object and I'm looking at its size, do I experience its size as a determinant value?

316
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:25,721
Is it true that in my average everyday experience that that door looks to be seven and a half feet tall?

317
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,361
Is that the way I experience size in it?

318
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:30,240
Or if that?

319
00:38:26,441 --> 00:38:33,441
I mean, if it's not, what else can you say about the way I experience it?

320
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:39,121
I think you probably best said to experience size and how the object affords itself.

321
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,281
Tell me more, what do you mean by that?

322
00:38:41,281 --> 00:39:00,320
You know, that door looks like a door that I could walk through, I would think that it's at least above, you know, six and a half feet of wall, and based upon my experiences, how I walked through doors and how much spaces above my head that it would afford itself as that, but there was a small door in a playhouse or something.

323
00:39:00,321 --> 00:39:07,921
And it just, I wouldn't know what size it was per se, when four inches tall by two inches, but I would know that.

324
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,280
So that might be right.

325
00:39:09,281 --> 00:39:13,041
Maybe we experience sizes in terms of the activities that they afford.

326
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:19,841
And big, you know, an object that's of a certain size that's graspable might afford a certain kind of grip.

327
00:39:19,841 --> 00:39:28,000
An object of a certain size that's walk-throughable might afford a certain kind of walking through and so on, or walking through with a certain posture.

328
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,200
Maybe.

329
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,761
Okay.

330
00:39:29,761 --> 00:39:32,240
But that's what I think that's a good suggestion.

331
00:39:32,241 --> 00:39:33,360
That's a possibility.

332
00:39:33,361 --> 00:39:35,520
And there may be other ways.

333
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:56,241
But whatever's true, it's just such it's a very different thing to have an experience of the size of an object when you're trying to judge its determinate value, trying to judge its size than it is when you have an experience of the size of an object in our normal everyday circumstances.

334
00:39:56,241 --> 00:40:05,680
So Christopher Peacock, who's a philosopher of mind and does philosophy of perception, who's an analytic philosopher, has a kind of intuition about this.

335
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,840
He doesn't have Mary Walabon T's account at all.

336
00:40:07,841 --> 00:40:10,240
But there's some things interesting about him.

337
00:40:10,721 --> 00:40:20,520
He writes at one point in the paper, he says, look, there are some people who are very, very good at seeing things to be a certain size.

338
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,601
He says, real estate agents.

339
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:27,240
They walk into the living room and they say, 14 by 17.

340
00:40:27,241 --> 00:40:27,560
Yeah.

341
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:37,641
But he says, unless you're really used to doing that, we need to develop the skill of seeing things to be a determinate size.

342
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:43,560
But unless you develop that skill, that's really not the way we experience the sizes of things.

343
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,560
So some farmers leave it as a negative clip.

344
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:51,561
It's really not the way in which we experience the sizes of things or the distance to things.

345
00:40:51,881 --> 00:41:01,161
But in order for this intellectualist account to work, well, you've got to have determinate values that you can plug into your function.

346
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:16,681
I mean, if the brain's really computing this function, you've got to have some determinate values, 7.5 feet by 13 feet, in order to plug them into the so many centimeters on the retinal image.

347
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,440
You've got to have determinate numbers to plug into the function.

348
00:41:20,761 --> 00:41:25,881
And what Malawi says is that's what the intellectualists are missing.

349
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:42,280
Even if it's true that the intellectualist makes the distinction between the size that the object looks to be and the way that that size looks, it's not true that they've missed some other phenomenon.

350
00:41:42,281 --> 00:41:53,241
They've missed some other aspect of the phenomenology because they say that the thing looks to be a determinate value, a determinate height.

351
00:41:53,241 --> 00:42:12,561
And that's true because both the image that it projects on the retina is experienced as a determinate value, and the distance to it is experienced as a determinate value.

352
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,441
And this determinate value is the ratio.

353
00:42:15,761 --> 00:42:24,961
Now, so that's so that I've sort of conceded that maybe as a function of the way the brain works, that's okay.

354
00:42:26,401 --> 00:42:35,280
But I'm sort of suggesting that as a function of the way the experience is, that's not right.

355
00:42:35,441 --> 00:42:38,000
Now, let's go into that a bit.

356
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,520
I said I was going to give two different kinds of intellectualist accounts.

357
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:48,401
The first is the modern-day cognitivist unconscious processing account that I just talked about, due to rock and so on.

358
00:42:48,560 --> 00:43:04,000
But there's another kind of account that you might give that would really attribute to the subject determinate experiences of the size of the image and determinate experiences of the distance to the object.

359
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:31,720
An account like this, and you find them out there, an account like this would have to say that in order to make this distinction, we have to say that when I see the size of the door, I experience both the size that it looks to be, and I experience the apparent size, the way that size looks in the current context, right?

360
00:43:31,801 --> 00:43:36,561
It's something like the image that it projects onto my retina.

361
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,720
I think that it's kind of hard to imagine that I experience both of those things.

362
00:43:42,921 --> 00:43:59,081
And also, I've had to experience hard to imagine that I could experience both the size the object looks to be and the apparent size, the retinal image, the sort of sense data, simultaneously.

363
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:05,240
It seems to me very difficult to imagine that we can experience both of those downloads.

364
00:44:05,321 --> 00:44:10,120
Now, people are good at experiencing the apparent size.

365
00:44:10,441 --> 00:44:12,120
What kind of person is good at that?

366
00:44:13,721 --> 00:44:15,721
What do you have to do to be good at that?

367
00:44:15,881 --> 00:44:16,600
Painters.

368
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,681
Painters are really good at that, right?

369
00:44:18,841 --> 00:44:19,881
What does the painter do?

370
00:44:19,881 --> 00:44:31,241
The painter sort of squints and says, if I were going to paint an image of that next to that, I'd make something about this tall, and then the garbage can would be this tall, right?

371
00:44:31,241 --> 00:44:39,480
And the painter sort of squints, and Merle Ponty, I'm terrible at finding these passages, but Merle Ponty talks about the painters squinting.

372
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:51,961
Here we go, on my 307 in, let's see, near the footnote, the long footnote that begins, indeed, it has been shown, Geld and Goldstein.

373
00:44:51,961 --> 00:44:56,520
Okay, the paragraph begins in gaslight as blue paper looks blue.

374
00:44:56,841 --> 00:45:19,961
So about three sentences down, he says, the painter achieves the same result without a screen, never mind what he's talking about, and manages to see colors as they are, or sizes or shapes and so on, manages to see colors as they are determined by the quantity and quality of reflected light, provided that he isolates them from their surrounding by half closing his eyes, for example.

375
00:45:20,441 --> 00:45:22,480
And that's a natural thing for you to do.

376
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:27,961
If you need to focus on the apparent property or the image, to how squint your eyes.

377
00:45:28,321 --> 00:45:51,040
But the intellectualist who's going to give an account of the experience or the constant size of an object by saying that first I see the size of the image and then take account of the distance to it and thereby come to have an experience of the size.

378
00:45:51,281 --> 00:46:05,520
The intellectualist who says something like that is going to have to be committed to the idea that when I'm experiencing this thing to be a certain size, I'm also experiencing the occurrence size, the image.

379
00:46:05,921 --> 00:46:14,401
And it seems to me that although you can switch back and forth between these, it's difficult to imagine having both of those experiences.

380
00:46:14,401 --> 00:46:31,441
Okay, so now what Malikonty wants to emphasize is that the intellectualist has made an advance, but has still missed a certain important part of the phenomenology.

381
00:46:31,441 --> 00:46:48,081
So the advance that the intellectualist has made is that he's accepted, that there is this distinction in the phenomenology between the size or the color or the shape that an object looks to be and the way that size or color or shape looks in the current context.

382
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:59,520
But what he's meant is he's made the experience of these two things into an experience of a determinate bound, a determinate size or a determinate shape.

383
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:05,680
So Malibu thinks that really what you need is an important kind of indeterminacy, right?

384
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,281
It's a straight, an important kind of indeterminacy.

385
00:47:09,281 --> 00:47:26,201
And he thinks that any good account of the phenomenology is going to have an essential place for the indeterminacy that's a part of the experience of the constant size or shape or color of an object.

386
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:31,081
So he says, now I want to go to 301.

387
00:47:31,401 --> 00:47:33,160
Okay, okay, 350.

388
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:38,120
So paragraph that begins, thus we place ourselves directly within the object.

389
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:46,201
So here's, this is the critique of the intellectualist or the cognitivist view.

390
00:47:46,200 --> 00:48:07,561
He says, if we get this kind of intellectualist account that says the experience of the constant size of an object is something we get from having a constant ratio between the image and the distance to it, then we place ourselves directly within the object and we overlook the psychologist's problems, that's to say the empiricist psychologist's problems.

391
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:14,360
We overlook them because the empiricist psychologist remember didn't make this distinction at all, and the intellectualist can't.

392
00:48:14,361 --> 00:48:16,520
But how have we really left them behind?

393
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:41,881
When it says that the true size or shape are no more than the constant law according to which the appearance of the image, the distance, and the orientation for shape constancy vary, it's assumed that they can be treated as variables or measurable sizes, and therefore that they're determinate, that we experience the distance to the thing the way the real estate agent does.

394
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:51,080
What we're concerned with is precisely how they come to be so, how we come to have experiences as of the terminant qual point.

395
00:48:51,881 --> 00:48:56,600
Merrimsy's idea is that in normal everyday life, we don't have that kind of experience.

396
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,640
We have indeterminate experiences.

397
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,160
This is sort of a placeholder still.

398
00:48:57,801 --> 00:49:01,520
We don't know exactly what it means.

399
00:49:01,841 --> 00:49:08,961
We have indeterminate experiences, and the question is how we could ever come to have experiences of determinant qualities.

400
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:16,321
Kant is right in saying that perception is by its nature polarized towards the object.

401
00:49:16,321 --> 00:49:26,161
Kant is right, in other words, in rejecting the kind of Russellian view that says what we first see are the qualities, colors and shapes.

402
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:34,161
And only later do we see them, or even in Russell's view, come to believe that they are qualities of an object.

403
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:42,721
Merroponty thinks, and Kant thinks also, and this is what Kant got right, that our experiences are directed towards objects in the first place.

404
00:49:42,721 --> 00:49:52,560
And it's only in virtue of the fact that we already experience the object that we come to see its shape and its color and its side.

405
00:49:52,560 --> 00:50:05,121
Notice the way he describes the phenomenon of perceptual constancy in the opening sentences, he said in the second sentence, a thing has in the first place its side and its shape.

406
00:50:05,441 --> 00:50:09,281
You don't believe that if you're a Russellian kind of empiricist.

407
00:50:09,281 --> 00:50:14,081
In fact, the Russellian kind of empiricist thinks that there's a basic problem.

408
00:50:14,401 --> 00:50:17,441
Contemporary psychologists think there's a problem like this too.

409
00:50:17,441 --> 00:50:27,360
Namely, the problem is all we can ever see, of course, they say, is the colors and the shapes and maybe the sizes of things.

410
00:50:28,401 --> 00:50:31,121
All we can ever see are colors and shapes and sizes.

411
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:37,680
And the question is how do we bundle them together into an experience of a single unified object?

412
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:42,961
Well, we first see our colors and shapes and sizes, and we've got to somehow stitch them together.

413
00:50:44,921 --> 00:50:46,360
Hume has this problem.

414
00:50:46,361 --> 00:50:48,361
Russell has this problem.

415
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:57,801
They identify objects as bundles of properties that aren't already tied together in some more basic fashion.

416
00:50:57,801 --> 00:51:00,280
And contemporary neuroscientists have this problem.

417
00:51:00,281 --> 00:51:06,680
They call this the glue problem or the binding problem.

418
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:12,040
How do these properties get bound together into an experience of a single unified object?

419
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,280
And Merloponty says that's not right.

420
00:51:14,281 --> 00:51:16,040
And he says it's not right for the state.

421
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:18,201
And he thinks Kant got it too.

422
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:26,441
It's not right because it's not true that what we experience in the first place are isolated properties, not already tied together with one another.

423
00:51:26,441 --> 00:51:31,961
What we experience in the first place is an object, and we see it as having its properties.

424
00:51:31,961 --> 00:51:44,201
That's the way, so right from the essence, right in the way he's describing the problem of perceptual constancy, he's already rejecting a whole range of empiricist, potential empiricist solutions.

425
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,640
And he says Kant got that right.

426
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:51,401
Kant's right in saying that perception is, by its nature, polarized towards the object.

427
00:51:51,401 --> 00:51:57,801
But what's incomprehensible in his account is appearance as appearance.

428
00:51:57,801 --> 00:52:00,441
I never know what that means, so I probably should not read that.

429
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,720
Let's just stop there.

430
00:52:01,721 --> 00:52:16,961
What's wrong about his account, he thinks, is that although Kant thinks we, and in the collectors thinks we experience the object, well, we experience it by having determinate experiences of the contextual features and of the.

431
00:52:16,961 --> 00:52:20,921
So, Merloponcy says, we really need something else.

432
00:52:20,921 --> 00:52:26,681
We need an essential kind of indeterminacy in the phenomenology.

433
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:33,760
There's an important sense in which the way we experience the distance to an object is not as a determinate value.

434
00:52:33,761 --> 00:52:34,881
It's not the way to.

435
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:46,721
Now, does anyone have any sense of what the tools are in Merlot-Fonty's toolkit to describe this kind of indeterminacy?

436
00:52:46,721 --> 00:52:54,080
There's another, let's see, I guess it's in this chapter already.

437
00:52:54,080 --> 00:53:04,720
For at the beginning of this chapter, Merloponte has a characterization of what it is to experience the distance to something as indeterminate.

438
00:53:04,721 --> 00:53:09,361
Just think of a path where he's talking about that.

439
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:15,121
He's talking about sort of an experience of the distance to something.

440
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,080
That's not an experience of it as 1750.

441
00:53:18,241 --> 00:53:19,520
Think about it for a little bit.

442
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:24,321
It talks about seeing a painting in an art gallery.

443
00:53:24,321 --> 00:53:25,760
Have you guys talked about that?

444
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,000
Maybe we've talked about that before.

445
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:28,320
Okay.

446
00:53:28,321 --> 00:53:30,160
Well, this is the chapter where it comes up.

447
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,040
Maybe you've seen it before, but this is the chapter where it comes up.

448
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,361
In my book, it's on 302.

449
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,201
Reading 32.

450
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,720
215.

451
00:53:38,881 --> 00:53:40,560
Reading 1921.

452
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,160
That's 1952.

453
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:42,961
Okay.

454
00:53:43,281 --> 00:53:50,321
So I'm going to start a little above the important part.

455
00:53:50,321 --> 00:53:55,281
I'm going to start in the sentence that says, for science and objective thought, an apparently small object.

456
00:53:55,281 --> 00:54:00,080
So this is now in my version on 302, about 10 lines down.

457
00:54:01,761 --> 00:54:02,240
Okay.

458
00:54:02,881 --> 00:54:05,441
I'm just going to read this passage and then I'll say something about it.

459
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:22,441
For science and objective thought, so for science and objective thought, that's to say, thought that thinks that the only kinds of values, the only sort of kinds of experiences we can have are experiences as of determinate things.

460
00:54:22,761 --> 00:54:34,281
An apparently small object seen 100 yards away is indistinguishable from the same object seen 10 yards away at a greater angle.

461
00:54:34,281 --> 00:54:38,600
And the object is nothing but the constant product of the distance multiplied by the apparent size.

462
00:54:38,761 --> 00:54:40,601
That's the view that we just looked at.

463
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,680
That's the intellectualist view.

464
00:54:43,000 --> 00:55:02,520
So the intellectualist view says there's no difference for science and objective thought between, with respect to size, between an apparently small object presented 100 yards away and the same object seen 10 yards away at a greater angle.

465
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:06,601
But for me, the perceiver, there is a difference.

466
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,281
And here's the difference.

467
00:55:08,281 --> 00:55:16,520
The object 100 yards away is not as real and present in the sense in which it is at 10 yards.

468
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:28,281
And I identify the object in all its positions, at all distances, in all appearances, insofar as all the perspectives converge towards the perception which I've seen at a certain distance and with a certain typical orientation.

469
00:55:28,281 --> 00:55:29,881
So the idea is this.

470
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:38,921
When the object is 100 yards away, and it's not a biggerly big one, I experience it to be the same size.

471
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:50,601
But there's a sense in which I don't, he said, I don't experience that size to be as real and present as I do when it's 10 yards away.

472
00:55:50,600 --> 00:56:01,841
And the realness and the presence of the thing is going to be developed into what he's going to go on to say, is that I can't get a good perceptual grip on the size of the thing.

473
00:55:57,961 --> 00:56:04,961
I can't get a good perceptual grip.

474
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:09,921
I can't see its size very well when it's 100 yards away.

475
00:56:09,921 --> 00:56:11,760
I haven't got a good grip on it.

476
00:56:11,761 --> 00:56:13,520
And he goes on to say that.

477
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:28,641
This crucial perception, because it tells you this essential fact about the phenomenology of the experience of the size of objects, this crucial perception ensures the unity of the perceptual process and draws it into all other appearances.

478
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:45,520
For each object, and this is the passage that maybe you've read before, for each object, as for each picture in the art gallery, there's an optimum distance from which it requires to be seen, a direction viewed from which it vouchsafes most of itself.

479
00:56:45,841 --> 00:56:51,841
At a shorter or greater distance, we have merely a perception blurred through excess or deficiency.

480
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:57,441
We therefore tend towards the maximum of visibility and see the better focus as with a microscope.

481
00:56:57,441 --> 00:57:10,480
So, what's crucial about the indeterminacy of my experience of the distance to an object is that I don't experience it as a determinate value.

482
00:57:10,801 --> 00:57:13,921
I don't experience it as 17 feet away.

483
00:57:13,921 --> 00:57:21,201
I experience it as, well, too far away to see the thing well, to see the size of the thing well.

484
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:32,881
At 100 yards, it looks like the object is not as real and present because I feel immediately like I need to get closer to it in order to focus on its size.

485
00:57:32,881 --> 00:57:51,000
And that essential indeterminacy is the crucial thing that the intellectualist account lacked, despite the fact that the intellectualist account does something good, which is to make the distinction between the size the object looks to be and the way that size looks.

486
00:57:51,000 --> 00:58:13,560
So, the indeterminacy, that is essential to the phenomenology of size competency, is that the way I take into account the distance to the object is by experiencing it not as some determinate value, but in terms of how well it allows me to see the thing.

487
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,961
And it's going to, yeah, go ahead.

488
00:58:25,241 --> 00:58:27,080
Yeah, I can.

489
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:32,201
I think Merloponty says something that's sort of related to that.

490
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:36,280
But he doesn't say this all day.

491
00:58:36,281 --> 00:58:43,401
The psychologist recognizes that some distances are better distances than others from which to view the thing.

492
00:58:43,721 --> 00:58:45,560
Already Herring understood that.

493
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:51,401
Herring said there's an appropriate distance from which to view the size of the object, and that's its true size.

494
00:58:51,401 --> 00:59:03,801
His mistake was to say that that's the way I experience its size no matter what distance I am from it, by replacing my experience of it now with the memory that I had of it when I saw it at that distance.

495
00:59:04,361 --> 00:59:07,801
But he recognizes that there is an appropriate distance.

496
00:59:07,801 --> 00:59:14,601
And Melofonte depends on the idea that I experience some distance to be appropriate.

497
00:59:14,921 --> 00:59:28,801
But the difference is that the appropriate distance for Mero-Ponty has an essential kind of normativity built into it, an experience kind of normativity.

498
00:59:27,881 --> 00:59:34,400
It's not just that it is the distance at which I see the size best.

499
00:59:34,721 --> 00:59:36,880
You could determine that by doing experiments.

500
00:59:36,881 --> 00:59:44,961
You could just see from which distance the subject is best at judging the size of an object.

501
00:59:45,361 --> 00:59:48,480
You could ask them, well, you know, what's the size here?

502
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,560
And they could say seven foot six.

503
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:51,520
And you could ask them here.

504
00:59:51,841 --> 00:59:57,601
And you could ask them, you know, at various distances what the size of an object is.

505
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:03,121
And there will be some distance from which they are the best at judging that size.

506
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:06,161
And that's all the psychologist needs.

507
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:11,280
That's all the psychologist needs to say that there's an optimum distance from which to view the thing.

508
01:00:11,281 --> 01:00:23,200
That's the distance from which the subject makes the best judgments about what the size of a thing is, or makes the best judgments about what the shape of the object is, or makes the best judgments about what the color of the object is.

509
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:32,480
But that's not the sense in which Mero-Ponty understands the appropriate distance from which to experience the size of an object.

510
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,160
For Mero-Ponte, it's essentially a phenomenological fact.

511
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:41,761
It's something that I experience in experiencing the size of an object.

512
01:00:41,761 --> 01:00:47,281
That I'm now too close to see it well and need to move back.

513
01:00:47,281 --> 01:00:50,721
I'm now too far away to see it well and need to move forward.

514
01:00:50,721 --> 01:00:56,721
It's not a statistical fact about me that I make the best judgments when I'm at this distance.

515
01:00:56,721 --> 01:01:02,721
It's a phenomenological fact that I need to get closer in order to pay attention to it.

516
01:01:02,721 --> 01:01:07,841
And I think that's why the picture in the art gallery is a good example.

517
01:01:07,841 --> 01:01:14,201
The idea of the picture in the art gallery, as I read it, is, if you've been to art galleries, you know this.

518
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:22,121
You just find yourself coordinating your activity with respect to the painting when you're paying attention to it.

519
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,881
You don't think about it.

520
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:28,281
You don't make judgments about the distance to the object.

521
01:01:28,281 --> 01:01:35,800
You just immediately find yourself coordinating yourself with respect to the object when you're trying to pay attention to it.

522
01:01:35,801 --> 01:01:42,361
So if, for instance, I want to pay attention to the overall composition of the painting, I find myself backing up.

523
01:01:42,361 --> 01:01:45,801
I don't think beforehand that I want to back up.

524
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:50,361
It's not because I'm making some judgment about the distance to the object.

525
01:01:50,361 --> 01:01:55,321
I'm just immediately solicited to act that way in that context.

526
01:01:55,321 --> 01:02:04,200
And that's the sense in which I feel a kind of normative pung to put myself in the appropriate relation to the object.

527
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:14,921
So the way I understand it, the psychologist could take the appropriate relation to the object just to be the statistical norm.

528
01:02:15,241 --> 01:02:21,241
Whereas for Merrill Fonti, the appropriate relation to the object is really felt.

529
01:02:21,241 --> 01:02:23,160
It's really a part of the phenomenology.

530
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:28,201
And in fact, that's the way in which I experienced the distance to it.

531
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:35,400
It's in terms of whether that's a distance that requires me to move back or that requires me to move forward.

532
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:39,401
Requires me to increase it or requires me to decrease it.

533
01:02:39,401 --> 01:02:41,881
So I think that's the difference.

534
01:02:41,881 --> 01:02:47,721
One is a felt phenomenological norm, even if it's not noticed.

535
01:02:47,721 --> 01:02:51,000
It's just the kind of thing you automatically find yourself doing.

536
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,760
And the other is at least potentially.

537
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:59,200
So is this felt relative to the cost-created parents and clean composition?

538
01:02:57,881 --> 01:03:04,081
Yeah, it certainly is cost-relative in one sense.

539
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:09,600
It's certainly, I know this is a sort of background theme of the question.

540
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,081
It certainly is cost-relative in one sense.

541
01:03:12,401 --> 01:03:27,601
If I need to pay attention to the texture of the paintstrokes, then an appropriate distance will be much closer, and it'll be felt to be much closer than if I need to pay attention to the overall composition of the painting.

542
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:50,961
But it may be true that in another sense, this gets complicated, but it may be true that in another sense, even when I'm paying attention to the texture of paintstrokes, and so I'm very close up, I've experienced myself to be paying attention to the texture of the paintstrokes of that painting.

543
01:03:50,961 --> 01:03:57,520
That's to say, a painting which, qua painting, requires to be seen far back.

544
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:09,441
So I think there is a set, and I think this goes along very well with that second sentence of the chapter that says a thing has its characteristics, its size and its shape.

545
01:04:09,441 --> 01:04:16,240
The idea is that I experience first the object and only afterwards the various qualities of the object.

546
01:04:16,241 --> 01:04:24,560
Now, if I want to pay attention to some subset of the qualities, I may have to reorient myself and there will be different norms.

547
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:37,360
But insofar as I experience them to be qualities of that object, I already experienced myself to be, say, too close to see the object, though quite in the right position to see its, you know, this facet of it.

548
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:51,961
Yes, Olivia, perceptual behavior is being oriented by the fact that doing against you just to appear and be what you're doing is past related.

549
01:04:51,961 --> 01:04:59,720
The question is whether what whether in doing that, you also experience yourself to have a relation to the object.

550
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:01,640
Well, that's right.

551
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:02,520
I think that's right.

552
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:09,161
It all depends on whether what you think you experience first are parts or objects.

553
01:05:09,321 --> 01:05:12,920
I know honkey and cause are both very clear, though for different reasons.

554
01:05:12,921 --> 01:05:15,000
But what you experience first are objects.

555
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,080
And even if you're paying attention to some part of it, you experience it as a part of that object.

556
01:05:19,721 --> 01:05:20,600
Yeah, exactly.

557
01:05:21,881 --> 01:05:22,441
Yeah, exactly.

558
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:24,600
Yeah, Britt.

559
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:30,921
It seems like you have property constancies on the one hand and then this object constancy on the other.

560
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:40,920
And it it's clear how when the object is the focus of our attention, whether it's a painting or a property of a specific object, that I do experience this tension.

561
01:05:40,921 --> 01:05:45,480
But then there's also the problem of the background constancies of everything else.

562
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:49,800
I'm looking at you listening to what you're saying, noting the nodding gestures and so on.

563
01:05:49,801 --> 01:05:53,800
But then there's all this stuff happening around the noises and the light and the colors.

564
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:57,881
And so it also seems like you wanted an account for the constancies of those things.

565
01:05:57,881 --> 01:06:03,000
And it seems, you know, I wonder what that story would be and if it would be the I'm not sure I understood.

566
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,921
I I mean I can say this much.

567
01:06:04,921 --> 01:06:07,241
I'm not sure if this is the distinction you're making.

568
01:06:07,241 --> 01:06:27,921
It is true that there's a difference between the phenomenon of color constancy set, that I experience an object to have a constant color for a variation of the lighting pump, and object constancy set, that I experience an object to remain the same object throughout variantations of of presentation.

569
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:30,720
And there are weird ways in which this can go awry.

570
01:06:31,761 --> 01:06:43,121
There are sort of strange neuropsychological cases where people can, where people come in and claim that, you know, my wife was replaced by an alien.

571
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:46,000
Because, and I can tell you, Doc, she was replaced by an alien.

572
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,721
She looks exactly the same, but she's a different person.

573
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:59,041
She looks, every visual property of her is the same, but it's not her anymore.

574
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:01,441
Well, that's not a visual property on this view, right?

575
01:07:01,441 --> 01:07:09,121
She looks the same color, the same shape, the same size, same haircut, same clothes, same skin texture, same, and so on.

576
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:11,120
But she doesn't look kissable.

577
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:17,761
And that may be related to why the person doesn't experience her as the same person anymore.

578
01:07:17,761 --> 01:07:22,240
So that wouldn't by itself be an explanation of it.

579
01:07:22,241 --> 01:07:27,601
I mean, it's equally possible that if she doesn't look kissable, it's because I've fallen out of love with her.

580
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,480
Maybe more natural than that she would look kissable.

581
01:07:30,721 --> 01:07:44,480
So, but anyhow, this is just to say there may be a phenomenon of object constancy, where that's something that transcends even the phenomenon of the experience of an object as having constant properties.

582
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:48,000
I can experience it to be constant or not.

583
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,921
And this looks like a, and that may be a different issue.

584
01:07:52,160 --> 01:08:03,760
And when Merlot Honky says with cough that it's objects that I'm directed towards, I think he does mean objects in the pervert of Strawstonian phrase, the wavy sense, right?

585
01:08:03,721 --> 01:08:06,240
So I'm directed towards my wife.

586
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:10,480
And now that she's been replaced by an alien, she's a different thing.

587
01:08:11,521 --> 01:08:18,200
So that might be a different phenomenon that Merlot sort of touches on, but doesn't characterize.

588
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:29,400
I guess what I was getting at was more there almost seems to be like a chicken egg problem in that you have the properties of an object on the one hand and we say its properties.

589
01:08:29,881 --> 01:08:41,400
And so it seems like comment in Rerlopan TV on your reading is going to place a priority on our sense of there being this one object there and that is the object that has its political figure.

590
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:41,561
Yeah.

591
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,600
And these kinds of things.

592
01:08:44,601 --> 01:08:53,480
And so if there is this kind of priority on the object in that sense, I'm curious to know about stuff like the wall that's unbuckling to you.

593
01:08:53,961 --> 01:09:07,000
But like in your discussions about the color of the wall with Alva Alba and others and bringing contrast to Russell, then if the wall's color becomes the focus of the conversation, then we're sort of paying attention to the wall.

594
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:13,160
But I'm curious about how we sustain the constancy of the wall while I'm just talking to you and I don't even care about particularly the wall.

595
01:09:13,721 --> 01:09:15,240
So I don't feel attention.

596
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:18,200
I don't feel drawn to look at the wall when I'm talking to you.

597
01:09:18,521 --> 01:09:19,881
Yeah, I do experience the wall.

598
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:20,600
Good.

599
01:09:20,601 --> 01:09:27,961
Well, I do have something long and complicated to say about this, and we'll hope to try to say something about it Thursday.

600
01:09:27,961 --> 01:09:44,040
Roughly, the story is that the way in which you experience the wall when it's part of your visual field as the background to me, which is what you're focused on, is that you experience it as having a view on me.

601
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:51,000
If you experience it as something that maintains me as a constant figure that has a backside, as Merlovoni says.

602
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:52,761
That's how you explain that marketing passage.

603
01:09:52,841 --> 01:09:53,160
Yeah.

604
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:53,881
Exactly.

605
01:09:53,881 --> 01:09:55,841
Well, we're at 60, 68, or whatever.

606
01:09:55,721 --> 01:09:57,440
Yeah.

607
01:09:57,681 --> 01:10:04,400
But that's the passage where Revolvanti says, I experience objects as seeing one another.

608
01:10:04,721 --> 01:10:09,600
I experience the chimney as having a view on the back side of the lamp.

609
01:10:09,601 --> 01:10:12,000
Can I remind you that you guys can guess it?

610
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:20,961
If you read Sean's paper, it's on the website of seeing things in the Arlofonte, where he discusses this whole issue.

611
01:10:20,961 --> 01:10:27,360
And if you get time and more inventory than Arlo Fonti for Thursday, that's the thing to do.

612
01:10:27,761 --> 01:10:30,400
Somebody Martin was saying it's hard to find on the website, is it?

613
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,400
On the web, do you mean even by what you're talking about?

614
01:10:32,641 --> 01:10:41,280
On the website for the course, there's a link to what did I call it, a virtual reader or papers for the course, something like that.

615
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:48,560
You go to the department, you go to me, you go to my courses, you go to this course.

616
01:10:50,561 --> 01:10:52,641
Not this person, because I'm May left.

617
01:10:52,641 --> 01:10:52,881
Yeah.

618
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:55,120
But you must have plenty of thumbs up.

619
01:10:56,961 --> 01:10:58,801
Okay, there we go if you want to do it.

620
01:10:58,801 --> 01:10:59,200
Okay.

621
01:10:59,200 --> 01:10:59,841
Okay.

622
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:00,320
Yeah.

623
01:11:01,681 --> 01:11:05,120
There is one sort of optimal way of looking at an object.

624
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:09,841
So suppose just to simplify that there's four properties of object you're concerned with.

625
01:11:09,841 --> 01:11:13,600
It's shape, its color, its size, and say its texture.

626
01:11:14,481 --> 01:11:23,360
I can just very well imagine that a variety of different perspectives on that same object will give me some ratio of balance between taking in those different properties.

627
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:29,680
And there may be multiple different perspectives which grant me sort of an equal ratio.

628
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:32,881
I don't mean to say something determinate about that.

629
01:11:33,681 --> 01:11:46,600
No, I think I think it's an extreme oversimplification to suggest that there's one optimum position from which to stand to see to see the object best.

630
01:11:42,801 --> 01:11:49,240
I think in every real case it's false.

631
01:11:49,561 --> 01:11:54,360
It's false for a very simple reason once you've got three-dimensional objects, right?

632
01:11:54,601 --> 01:12:05,000
I mean, for three in the case of color and lighting context, you can imagine that maybe in laboratory contexts, the simplification actually works.

633
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:14,760
So that there really is a best lighting context in which to view the color of this object today, given my mood and my visual acuity and so on.

634
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,240
So maybe that's right.

635
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:28,600
But once you get into real objects, it's sort of obviously false that there's a single optimal place to stand from which to see the object.

636
01:12:28,681 --> 01:12:30,761
You don't even need to add other qualities.

637
01:12:30,761 --> 01:12:34,040
You can just make the object a full three-dimensional object.

638
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:43,160
And then, as Mervyn Holmkey says, the optimum view from which to see the object is the view from everywhere.

639
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:45,240
Not the light mitzvah view from nowhere.

640
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,320
He rails about that against that.

641
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:48,600
But the view from everywhere.

642
01:12:48,601 --> 01:12:53,480
Because that's the view that presents equally all sides of the object.

643
01:12:53,481 --> 01:12:55,560
But of course, that's not a view that I can take.

644
01:12:56,120 --> 01:13:04,440
So every perspective that I take on the object is going to be a deviation in some way or another from that optimum.

645
01:13:04,761 --> 01:13:12,921
So the optimum doesn't have to be an optimum that I could take up.

646
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:27,160
It doesn't have to be an optimum that's possible an optimum context that it's possible for me to be in in order for me, nevertheless, to experience the current situation to be a deviation from it.

647
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:31,040
And I think that's what will go on when you get these multiple qualities.

648
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:38,560
I mean, the optimum will be this sort of crazy thing and it's just sort of not possible to even to imagine maybe.

649
01:13:38,561 --> 01:13:44,881
But still, I could experience my current context, given my current needs and desires and so on, to be a deviation.

650
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:51,600
So when Relevanti says we have a tendency towards getting a maximum grid, do you think it's that optimum, an achievable?

651
01:13:51,921 --> 01:14:09,520
Yeah, I mean, in the case of, say, the simple case of experiencing an object as a full three-dimensional object, to say that we're tending towards it is different than to say it's achievable or the kind of thing I could even imagine myself achieving.

652
01:14:09,521 --> 01:14:19,681
But it is to say that I can experience the current context as a deviation from it in the sense that, well, here's a way to improve the current context.

653
01:14:19,841 --> 01:14:24,240
Get a little closer, or go around to the front of the object, or and so on.

654
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:27,520
Turn it right side up instead of upside down.

655
01:14:28,561 --> 01:14:40,481
Those kinds of norms will help me experience will help to characterize the experience that I have of the context, even if there are deviations from an optimum that couldn't even in principle.

656
01:14:40,721 --> 01:14:41,681
Okay, so that'll set up.

657
01:14:41,681 --> 01:14:43,520
So yeah, that'll set up next time.

658
01:14:43,521 --> 01:14:43,921
Great.
