1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,479
So let's start on 292.

2
00:00:04,159 --> 00:00:15,039
You've heard this already, maybe once or twice, I don't remember how many, but we'll just take this as a sort of text for the first half hour anyway, about eight lines down.

3
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:32,680
My body is geared into the world when my perception presents me with a spectacle as varied and as clearly articulated as possible, and when my motor intentions, as they unfold, receive the responses they expect from the world.

4
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,519
Those are the three things that you're trying to optimize.

5
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:48,599
This maximum sharpness of perception and action points clearly to a perceptual ground, a basis of my life, a general setting in which my body can coexist with the world.

6
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:52,039
That's probably the basic idea of the book.

7
00:00:52,039 --> 00:01:00,599
And what we got involved with is a whole bunch of issues around that.

8
00:01:00,599 --> 00:01:12,680
So I'm just going to sort of first put that in perspective and then tell you what I think the four questions are that that raises or that you've all raised and that then I think I can now answer.

9
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:25,720
So all the arguments in the space chapter which you've just read, and I suppose in the whole book, depend on the organisms seeking not just a good grip, but the best one.

10
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:36,200
And now I did say for, in my notes, probably I said it in quiet, for this past in these circumstances.

11
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:40,280
So that's why I think at least we're once you could say, I think that's wrong.

12
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,759
And I'll have to argue for that in a minute.

13
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:50,599
I think it depends on the organism seeking not just a good grip, but the best one.

14
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,799
That's right.

15
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,679
But it's not for this past in these circumstances.

16
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,479
There is one best grip, independent of culture, independent of task.

17
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,239
That's what you all were denying and what I was defending.

18
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:05,800
Maybe Olivier was defending it with me, I guess.

19
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,800
Sort of half.

20
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,840
That's what I thought.

21
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,519
But now I want to defend it head on in a minute.

22
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,440
So the chapter shows how important the idea of maximum grip is for Merrill Punching.

23
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:28,079
It's certainly, this we all agree on, necessary for us to have an experience of the size of anything, of distance, of motion, of shape.

24
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:31,840
And in the next chapter, it will be also of color.

25
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:38,879
All the constants that go together make up our experience of a perceptual object.

26
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,120
And now the question is what to do about that.

27
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,680
So I'm going to see where I'm.

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:57,039
Yeah, I thought I would just give one example, one specific example, before I turn to the really general story.

29
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,399
And so let's look, how do we determine how far away something is?

30
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:10,560
Well, do we do it by calculating the disparity between the way, how much our eyes are turned in in order to see it?

31
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,919
Or that Merrowpontee says, no, we don't calculate that.

32
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,840
Do we calculate it in terms of the distance and the apparent size of the object on the retina?

33
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:21,600
No, because we don't see that.

34
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,159
And we don't calculate it at all.

35
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,879
Something else is happening, something entirely different.

36
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,759
We keep talking about on 304.

37
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:42,000
But let me say it first, and then I think how far an object seems to us in experience is a function of how much of a grip we have on it.

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,320
And when it's near, then we have a good grip on it.

39
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,680
As it gets further and further, we get a less good grip on it.

40
00:03:49,680 --> 00:04:04,919
At a certain point, like when you're taking off in a plane, you rather suddenly, though I can't ever get a clear sense of exactly when it happens, you lose your grip on it and then houses and cars look like toys.

41
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,040
And you get this too from the top of the Empire State Building.

42
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,440
These perceptual constants break down at some point, and that's important.

43
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:18,600
Because then you do get something like the retina experience.

44
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:30,199
But normally, you get an experience of something getting further and further away and keeping a constant size, unlike the airplane experience.

45
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:42,279
But it's keeping a constant size, but how far away it is depends on your losing more and more of your sense of what was it, the clarity, the detail, and so forth.

46
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:51,720
So at the bottom of 304, about five lines from the bottom, taking the various apparent sizes of the retreating object, it is not necessary.

47
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:52,040
What?

48
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:53,399
Yeah.

49
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:55,959
That doesn't look like a thing.

50
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,320
Am I being deflected?

51
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:07,319
Taking the various apparent size of the retreating object, it is not necessary to link them in a synthesis if none of them has been specifically positive.

52
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:16,919
I guess I should say an aside, generally I think he's against syntheses because he always thinks that the whole is prior to the elements.

53
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,679
But sometimes he calls the way the whole organizes the elements itself a synthesis.

54
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,000
Here he's saying it's not a synthesis of elements.

55
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:33,560
We have the recruiting object, we never cease to hold it, and to have a grip on it.

56
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:44,240
And the increasing distance, now we're talking, how do you measure distance, is not, as breadth appears to us, an augmenting externality.

57
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:51,199
That is what if you get nearer something, you can see it getting bigger and bigger in your field, I guess.

58
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,839
But how does depth appear to you?

59
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:58,240
Because you can't see depth, it says, because it's not spread out in front of you.

60
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,279
That's the point.

61
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:07,120
So you can see how far you are from something spread out in front of you.

62
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,879
You could see it getting bigger as you get nearer and, well, not getting bigger.

63
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:11,839
You can see it.

64
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:12,719
That's the point.

65
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:17,440
You can see it as the same size as you get nearer and further away.

66
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,560
Yet you can see it as nearer and further away.

67
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,600
How come?

68
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:30,320
Well, not by a calculation from the apparent size, which stays the same, but from a sense of the grip changing.

69
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:38,800
Now, it expresses the distance that the thing is beginning to slip away from the grip of our gaze and is less closely allied to it.

70
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,679
Distance is what distinguishes this loose and approximate grip from the complete grip, which is proximity.

71
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,520
We shall define it then as we define straight and oblique.

72
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:58,560
That's the part about vertical orientation in terms of the situation of the object in relation to our power for grasping it.

73
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,680
Now, I'm just putting that in right now as Benny Dilbo.

74
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,360
He does the same thing with size and motion.

75
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:13,760
And I'm going to come back to them by the end of the hour if we get time.

76
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:23,239
But because I'm not sure we will get time, because I picture, although Olivier not being here, might make it possible to go further before we launch into one of these big discussions.

77
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:31,240
We may get involved in so many discussions over the four points I want to talk about, that we won't get back to it.

78
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:33,080
Well, in that case, too bad.

79
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:37,160
But it's important, more important, to get this overall picture.

80
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:56,599
So, the perception of the thing as a whole, with its this-ness and its fullness, remember, is the result of the impersonal body, the body schema, locking onto and thereby unlocking the thing in the natural world.

81
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:58,600
That's the overall picture.

82
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:10,520
And that's, and this is what I'm going to argue: the ground of all higher-level intentionality, which is, and it's the thing in the natural world, which is the subject of the next chapter.

83
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:22,120
You can think of what I'm doing when I talk about the next chapter and show you things in it, to tell you sort of what questions to be asking as you read it and what to be paying attention to as you read it.

84
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:30,280
And that chapter is so much more central than the space chapter, I think, that I don't mind doing that.

85
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:38,920
So, here are the four questions to keep in mind as you read the chapter on the thing and listen to Sean talk about it.

86
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:44,040
First, how is maximum grip related to the task?

87
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,280
That's the rig problem.

88
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,440
Remember the example of the desk?

89
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:59,240
Do I get an optimal grip on the desk just by looking at it in a way that lets me see its shape and its which qualities optimally?

90
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:03,319
Or how about when I'm looking for bubble gum under the desk?

91
00:09:03,319 --> 00:09:22,239
That's not going to be discovered by the general optimal way of looking at the desk there there's an optimal way of looking at the desk when you're looking for the bubble gum under it how is that related to the supposed just general optimal way of looking at the desk?

92
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:27,519
Or is that just a mistake on my part or Merlot-Ponty's part if you want that?

93
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,760
Well first let's just get Merleau-Ponty right, then we'll get the phenomena right.

94
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:46,400
Or is there, as I'm going to claim when we get back to point one, always one basic natural optimal grip which is independent of the task?

95
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,160
That's what I'm sure there is.

96
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,920
I'm sure I can explain to you how.

97
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,120
It's complicated, but it's there.

98
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,599
Then the second question is, and how about relative to the culture?

99
00:09:57,599 --> 00:10:07,839
Isn't the optimal grip also got to do what reveals the culture, reveals the object as it appears relative to the culture?

100
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,240
I think the answer is no.

101
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:18,240
These are all things I was defending last time, and you were all throw, or some people were throwing objections to me, and so I have to answer them.

102
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:40,160
Okay, the third question is, granted you're always experiencing the natural thing in some particular, in terms of an optimal, can you ever experience a natural thing alone without any of the task relative or cultural relative properties?

103
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,680
There, I think the answer is pretty clear, and I think Elizabeth quoted the passage.

104
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,319
Merleau-Ponty's answer is yes.

105
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:47,520
You can do that.

106
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,440
That's the cong of the wall in the Place de la Gonkard, yeah, no doubt.

107
00:10:52,760 --> 00:11:03,720
And finally, and this is a separate issue that I raise, and this is the one that throws its full grasp into the next chapter, but I raised it.

108
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:18,440
And so it should be on your mind, and it was certainly on my mind keeping me awake most of last night, which was the question: do you get a maximum grip, or do you only get a tendency toward a maximum grip?

109
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:26,200
And then people were saying, at least I was hearing, the objection that maybe you never get this optimal grip at all.

110
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:31,240
And I was saying, wrong, this time I'm wrong.

111
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:33,239
Three for me and one for you all.

112
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:52,199
Because I was saying you have to actually be able to experience the optimal grip in order to be able to experience objects as having a certain size, a certain shape, a certain color, a certain, I always don't remember that the width.

113
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:53,239
What is the one?

114
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,999
It's not a distance that the object has, that that's in there, but it's not a property of the object.

115
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,120
Size, that's one out.

116
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:03,800
Maybe I haven't heard one out.

117
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,480
I have to go back and look.

118
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,800
Maybe size, color, and shape.

119
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,199
Is that it?

120
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:09,399
That's it.

121
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:09,719
Okay.

122
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:15,080
Well, color, of course, stands in for sound and feel and everything.

123
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,399
A whole list of such of what I get with my senses.

124
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,800
What is the sanctilla?

125
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,760
How does that sense experience?

126
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,960
So that's a very important issue.

127
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:31,560
Do we ever experience the maximum?

128
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:39,359
And a sub-issue was saying, issue from another angle, do we need to experience before we can experience stable objects with properties?

129
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,400
I said NarrowConte said we do.

130
00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:44,720
I now think I was wrong.

131
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:47,200
I think he clearly says we don't.

132
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,040
Well, he also clearly says the opposite.

133
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,160
That's why this is such a hard one.

134
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,519
And the moral of this one is going to be when we get there, number four, get to the phenomenon.

135
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,359
Don't panic.

136
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:01,520
There's a way of getting it all together.

137
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,800
Oh, there must be, since there is a phenomenon.

138
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,839
Okay.

139
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:12,640
I don't want to discuss anything, but I want to make sure I haven't lost everybody because it is, yeah, of course, you have a problem.

140
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,160
So what was question number three?

141
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:17,999
Oh, yeah, well, I went very fast over three, because I don't think it's important.

142
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:19,840
And I think the answer is clear.

143
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:32,079
Can we experience the natural thing in a way that is independent of any cultural stance that we have and any past that we have?

144
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:45,360
Just in its pure naturalness, which means for everybody who has a body, whether it's a pre-linguistic infant, whether it's somebody in Bali, whether it's somebody medieval, and even climates.

145
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,839
Is there such a way that we can just perceive the thing in its pure natural finness?

146
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,520
That's the third one.

147
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,600
Anything else?

148
00:13:56,239 --> 00:13:59,360
Okay, let's take them one by one.

149
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:02,400
How is the natural gift related to the task?

150
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:09,280
That's the most fun, in a way, because that's purely a question of getting a phenomenon.

151
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,679
But let's just sort of see what's going on.

152
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,120
The death has a shape, a size, a color, and feel and smell, presumably.

153
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:21,640
And Sean wants to add to this list, top and bottom.

154
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,640
That's the orientation part of the chapter, which I'm dipping over.

155
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:40,920
But John does their experiments to show we experience all objects as having a top and a bottom or as weird things that we can't figure out where their top and bottom is, but we won't be able to get a good grip on them until we do.

156
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:45,000
That's probably true, but I'm going to skip that.

157
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:46,839
We don't need to bring that in.

158
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:51,880
We'll stick to the desk has a faith, size, and color.

159
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:55,479
And there is a way in which...

160
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,639
Oh, oh, yeah, here's a parenthesis.

161
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,280
I couldn't resist saying this at this point.

162
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:08,840
Isn't it interesting that shape, size, and color crosses the distinction between primary and secondary qualities?

163
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:17,959
In case you thought that what we were getting here in this list of properties were all relative to us in the same way, they're not.

164
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:30,199
I mean, remember the whole Galileo and modernity move, that the color is relative to us, but presumably the size and shape are just there in the universe.

165
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:48,999
And Merle Ponty is not interested in it because he thinks that all of them are relative to us and are relative to us in the same way, and in a certain way aren't relative to us at all, because they're really the way the thing in the natural world is.

166
00:15:49,320 --> 00:16:06,959
Now, behind this, that I'm not going to talked about, is a question of idealism always lurking, but because somehow the thing in the natural world is the way the thing just naturally is, and the thing in the natural world is the way it is, because we've got the body set to unlock it that way.

167
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,799
But don't worry about that.

168
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:10,879
Back to what we should be worrying about.

169
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:31,599
So if one claims that things are always presented as some deviation from an optimal for us to experience a stable object, then how do we deal with the Rick objection that the optimal depends on the task?

170
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,239
I'm not now.

171
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:35,759
The answer is simple.

172
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,039
You've got to have, I don't know what you all think, Ask it.

173
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,719
Let's take a vote.

174
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:55,920
How many think that there you lose the relevance or you cover up or you something, the general optimal when you have some task which has its own optimal?

175
00:16:56,239 --> 00:16:56,879
That's how people.

176
00:16:59,199 --> 00:16:59,600
Yes.

177
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,239
Yeah, okay.

178
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:08,640
How many believe there is a general optimal according to Merlot-Ponty and the phenomena, which I'm going to say are always on the same side.

179
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:16,559
And if you do believe there is an optimal, do you believe that it gets trumped or covered up by the task?

180
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,400
I think this is my main contribution this morning.

181
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:27,279
I think I understood something that I haven't understood before, and that's an important question and it has a clear answer.

182
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:47,839
When I go under the desk, which I'm not going to do right now, to look for the bubble jump, if Merrill-Ponty is right and it feels right to me, I'm going to at the same time feel that I'm getting a very good grip on the bottom of the desk and the bubble jump, and I'm going to be feeling at the same time that I'm getting a terrible view of the desk.

183
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,799
You're going to be feeling, if he's right, that there is a better way to see the desk.

184
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:58,039
And if you weren't busy looking for the bubble gum, that's where you'd be pulled to go.

185
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:04,279
But you'll resist that pull toward this better way as long as you've got this task.

186
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:08,120
But the task doesn't in any way override the optimal.

187
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:21,799
Because the optimal is always there as the pull, as the sense that you are not getting the best view of the desk, and it would be better over there, which Manuel Punchy describes as a tension, a sense of unbalance.

188
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:25,319
Particularly, the unbalance comes in when you're looking at the shape of something.

189
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:31,640
There's some shape, he says, I won't rush to find the text, in which you see the optimal balance.

190
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:37,719
And you're going to be getting a very unbalanced view of the shape of the desk under there looking for the gums.

191
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:43,319
And you're going to be always pulled to get the better one and sense that there's a better one.

192
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:57,239
And let me just, and the basic reason why that must be right is that you constantly experience the desk as a stable object with a size, a shape, a color.

193
00:18:57,239 --> 00:19:08,519
And to do that while going under to look for the bubble gum, even though it's dark under there and the color looks sort of different and the shape is ungodly messed up and so forth, that the object doesn't begin to mess up.

194
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:16,839
Why doesn't the object begin to get unstable and you can't tell what shape it is and you can't tell what color it is and you don't understand, you know, you wonder what size it is.

195
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,799
Why doesn't it?

196
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:23,879
Because you're always experiencing yourself as deviating from the optimal while you're doing the task.

197
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,040
Now, oddly enough, Eric does not seem happy.

198
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,519
I should think everybody would go up their hands with the light.

199
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,759
So, the thing would go under the desk, the bubblegum.

200
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:36,320
You get yourself through a terrible condescension.

201
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:39,359
Do you all send the sense of terrible steeling?

202
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:41,920
No, because you're not trying to see them.

203
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:45,359
I could switch that into this existential point.

204
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:57,040
All of this has got to be sort of existentialized, meaning there's something you're trying to cope with now that you're interested in, because you can't be trying to get it to the one every day, right?

205
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:00,079
Ah, good, I see what you're saying now.

206
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,160
Well, yes and no.

207
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,640
I mean, if you could, it's interesting.

208
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:12,079
If you could get so involved with the bubblegum, the issue that that was the whole object of the desk didn't matter.

209
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:14,079
Then I think you're right, Eric.

210
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:18,400
Then the whole thing switches over and it becomes a bubblegum issue.

211
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,759
But it's not relative.

212
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:28,799
What's relative to the task, I see what you're saying, is what's going to be the stable object and what's going to go into the background.

213
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,479
That's but that's okay.

214
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,480
Well, it's interesting.

215
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,360
No, I don't know.

216
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,959
Think of the phenomenon.

217
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:43,120
What happens to the desk if you go under and look for the gum?

218
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,719
Well, I'll go in and, oh, well, I'm so sure what's going to happen, but I'll go check.

219
00:20:48,719 --> 00:20:49,999
Okay, my mind's not going to be.

220
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,080
Well, there's no gum, that's sure.

221
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,360
And the desk stayed the same shape and the same color and all that, which is important.

222
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,279
And how do you account for that?

223
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:03,920
I want to say, wait, wait, wait, okay, well, here, Louvie, let Eric first.

224
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,880
It's his problem.

225
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,160
I mean, it's understood.

226
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:06,719
What?

227
00:21:06,719 --> 00:21:07,680
It's under the same problem.

228
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,680
I believe it, but one at a time.

229
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,279
Okay, Eric, well, what?

230
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:11,999
I think you.

231
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,599
I mean, I mean, Rick.

232
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:14,400
That's okay.

233
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:22,279
I think your way of phrasing was sneaky, as Eric was pointing out, because you just, you're very, there are different tasks involved.

234
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:31,559
So everything that you're saying, I can redescribe in a task-relative way, such that we don't need to posit what you're calling, I guess, like a joint.

235
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:34,839
There's always got to be, yeah, I may have described it wrong.

236
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,119
Let me try again.

237
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:43,160
There's some object that you're coping with, and that will be selected by the task.

238
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,559
That's what you and Eric are right about.

239
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:54,600
But whatever object is selected by the task, that object's properties are not determined by the task.

240
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:04,360
That object has, this is where we're disagreeing, and then it comes up next, its own optimal, which is settling what color and shape and so forth it has.

241
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:10,360
So here's my forgetting the bubblegum, because you're just kind of playing off the idiosyncrasy of that example.

242
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:21,559
I could just say that, imagine there are different people, an archaeologist's way of studying the table, and the way you do get a maximum grid of the table, or his kind of whatever, kind of like archaeological past would be.

243
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:27,400
So you could have an ENG collector who would want a different kind of ripoff at the table.

244
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,999
And then suppose I'm just a consumer and I want to buy tables and I want a sense of whether it would fit in my room and what.

245
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:33,799
I see that.

246
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:38,359
There are different quantities.

247
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:38,680
That's all.

248
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:43,799
It just goes back to what all of them.

249
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,799
Okay, that's all true.

250
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:54,440
But there is in it, according to Merlot Ponty, and I think he's right, an experience of the table, or which you can look for is scratches and so forth.

251
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:07,600
And just keep your eye on the fact that we're surrounded by objects which have stable shapes, sizes, colors, and so forth.

252
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:26,719
And the and the and the Merrill-Plantique claim is that stays constant and is a done by the body schema in a task irrelevant, person irrelevant, affectivity that is what you care about and desire, irrelevant way.

253
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:31,120
That's what it means to say that one does it indeed that it's done by the body schema.

254
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,039
That's what I'm trying to explain.

255
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,319
And that seems the right thing to say, but now I see it, yeah.

256
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:52,879
Well, I think we could lead out basically I don't, because it's it's if you do the social definitions, but I think even though every object is whatever you do is always testable.

257
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,920
Because every object just offers an importance.

258
00:23:56,239 --> 00:23:56,640
What?

259
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,479
An importance as you are at that.

260
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:09,440
So if you go to the bubble under the table, it just means that when you go towards the table, you know that if you want to get the best dantage point on the table, you will stop there.

261
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,959
But you don't take this into account.

262
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:11,839
You know that you could.

263
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,040
So you okay, there is this dimension in your experience.

264
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,360
And in fact, how is it predominant in your experience?

265
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:23,119
The fact that who you want to get the best damage point on the table is that, well, you avoid the thing.

266
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:25,759
You just don't go in this position.

267
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:26,799
You know it's here.

268
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:32,719
And this best density point corresponds to the fact that you have like something in the table, but you go under it.

269
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:33,680
Well, I don't know.

270
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:35,279
The goggle gun.

271
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:45,600
I mean, the synthesis of the tasks that happens when you go to the goggle gun implies that you integrate the fact that you could have been sleeping at the table, but if you don't do so.

272
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,239
You go further.

273
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:47,360
Why is that important?

274
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,999
Well, I mean, this before that, you started with a premise that I didn't get.

275
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,000
It isn't always an affordance.

276
00:24:53,239 --> 00:24:58,599
That tree doesn't afford anything to me, but I'm not all the same thing as side of size and a shape.

277
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:02,519
You can think of the cases of utilization behavior, you know.

278
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:15,559
But I don't want to think of it as big vague, or if I do, never utilization days, there is these weird cases where the big brain-injured person, if there's a chair, sits on it, if there's an apple and the device there.

279
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,599
But I don't have even this vague.

280
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,160
I don't feel like it's not.

281
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:26,120
It's very interesting because it doesn't fit into account because desires, president desires like no.

282
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:34,839
So it's very interesting because it's only related to the flow of time and the way it integrates partial events or everything you're saying.

283
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,199
It shouldn't.

284
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,079
I don't believe that it's related to the flow of time.

285
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,319
I don't believe that my experience is that everything is related to the flow of time, of course.

286
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,799
It doesn't in the flow of time.

287
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:46,680
Of course, it does.

288
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,160
But I can't believe that that's the issue.

289
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,999
The issue is simpler than that.

290
00:25:50,999 --> 00:26:08,680
The issue is that we have in us a kind of impersonal perceiver that perceives objects in an impersonal way, meaning that anybody from any culture with any task or perceived apple.

291
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:11,959
Right.

292
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,719
It's natural.

293
00:26:13,719 --> 00:26:14,519
It's company.

294
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,160
Of course.

295
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,920
I mean, I don't think there would be plenty of time to say that.

296
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,360
Well, because time is natural.

297
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,680
So yeah, sure, space natural.

298
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,800
No, or maybe not.

299
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,160
So what?

300
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:28,920
Can't we separate it from time and say there are natural objects?

301
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:31,479
But what you do is always in time.

302
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:31,880
Yes.

303
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:38,640
If you stick to the phenomena as you propose to do, then you have to take into account the fact that there are inventions.

304
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:41,600
Well, you could stop at the table and you have to be able to notice it.

305
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:48,400
And you have to and notice what you think the table would be not to go in the direction, as to get the best notes going.

306
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:57,119
Let's go under it because there's another task that presupposes that first you take into account the presence of the table to get the shooting of that under it.

307
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,479
Otherwise it wouldn't be under the bottom.

308
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,199
I don't see why.

309
00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:00,719
I mean I don't think any of you say it's wrong.

310
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:03,279
I just want to repeat what I said because I don't think that I need anything.

311
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,559
Well what I mean is that then you can say that the objects are not task related.

312
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,279
Factory.

313
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,760
That's the term I've already tasked related.

314
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:12,560
Factory.

315
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:14,319
Oh related.

316
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:14,799
Oh good.

317
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,599
Oh the ob good.

318
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,279
I was afraid something new was happening.

319
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,279
The objects are not related.

320
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,880
I mean related to what?

321
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,400
Each other, the task, me?

322
00:27:22,719 --> 00:27:24,479
The objects aren't related to the task.

323
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,999
We agree about that, don't we?

324
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:31,599
Which object I'm dealing with, what the lady wants to do does change the object property.

325
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:45,759
But you don't have to say, I mean, saying that the objects are fascinated doesn't mean that, okay, that's what I tried to say when I said which object you're dealing with is task related and and what you're paying attention to on the object is task related, like the scratch.

326
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:47,759
But the object isn't task related.

327
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:56,000
That is the underlying natural, stable, perceptual object, and that's what followed into the the body schema.

328
00:27:55,999 --> 00:27:59,440
I mean, it you keep that personal body schema in the background.

329
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,160
It's not there just for fun.

330
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:19,440
It's doing the basic job of giving you a world of objects with, I have to just keep repeating, they have a constant size, this chair and that's independent of whether I know it's a chair and a forward sitting or not on the on this Merrill-Ponjee theory.

331
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,719
Uh yeah, James.

332
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:28,759
Okay, I mean, I agree that this is a view that you could have, and I think this could be a red view, but I'm just very spectacular in Malabon theory.

333
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:29,959
Well, that's interesting.

334
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:32,120
There are quotes that kind of fit this, but not yet.

335
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:32,359
Okay.

336
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:46,199
I mean, I don't think that they're okay, well, they're not body schema, and what you just said is relevant, because it seems to me that whatever the optimal group is going to be, it has to be human.

337
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:46,520
Yeah.

338
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:46,760
Right?

339
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:48,920
It's not independent of the body schema.

340
00:28:48,999 --> 00:28:50,119
It has to be in the optimum.

341
00:28:50,199 --> 00:28:51,079
Yeah, what about this quote?

342
00:28:51,239 --> 00:29:07,319
Near the bottom, he says in the last analysis, if my body can be a form, and if there can be in front of it important figures against indifferent backgrounds, this occurs in virtue of its being polarized by its past, of its existence towards them, of its collecting together of itself in its pursuit of its aims.

343
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,559
I don't know what to do with that on the screen here.

344
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,759
Well, I don't see the problem.

345
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:25,160
I think that the task, again, to stick to the phenomenon of the task orients me toward the object, and you couldn't, you wouldn't be normally oriented to the object without a task.

346
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,800
I think the classical econom card shows you can be.

347
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,999
You could just stop your job and stare at the wall.

348
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:33,640
But you were doing something.

349
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,999
Do you think you have a task right now?

350
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:36,920
Well, but it is.

351
00:29:37,719 --> 00:29:40,920
You're doing something because I think you decide who stopped or being interested.

352
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,360
I mean, it's sort of paradoxical to say your task is not that any task.

353
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:48,199
One thing at a time.

354
00:29:48,199 --> 00:29:58,759
So you've got a task, and your body schema, you know, it says body image, but we all know it's body schema, is that your is that your body is in the world.

355
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:04,359
Well, the main thing this is emphasizing, I don't disagree with it or anything James said.

356
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:08,079
It's just in a it's got a different issue on its mind.

357
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:27,759
It's that there is always, and that's why this is hard to talk about, normally the body is engaged in a task and it's got in a culture, and all that is involved in being in the world because Mero Conti is, if anybody in the world is, a holist through and through.

358
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,600
And that's right.

359
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:48,160
And yet, within this holism, there is this claim about the fundamental structural ground of our perception of objects that we share and we're back again with creatures that don't have our kinds of tasks and so forth.

360
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:58,160
And that's not incompatible with the fact that we normally do see objects because of our interest.

361
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,319
But they don't, and this is crucial for him.

362
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,799
They are going there's a certain level at which they look the same no matter what.

363
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,799
I mean, I mean, yes, that's a critical point.

364
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,440
You can't because don't view the body.

365
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:29,040
I mean, unless you have very strong neural nerds or I mean, the the the the the interests of the body uh tell you what to do, what you're going to be interested in doing with such or such under the control, or why you're interested in knowing that there is no gun under the table.

366
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:36,799
But the fact that you have different interests maybe to look at the goddamn gun under the table will change the colour of the gold.

367
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,160
I mean, wait, wait, wait, wait.

368
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:42,959
I wanna I don't need sorry about this, but I I I think we have to go on for a minute.

369
00:31:42,959 --> 00:31:53,079
We'll c we can come back to this, but we can't, we're not getting in, and we're not going to get any further with this, and we're not going to get my four points done if you don't talk for th for a while talking about it.

370
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:57,479
So I'm just going to say again what I said, and then we can all come back to it later.

371
00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:04,519
So I want to say that, I mean, and I see now that my wonderful solution was too simple.

372
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:13,959
But when I said that we have two tasks at once, to keep the table stable and the bubblegum stable, that didn't solve the problem, right?

373
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:57,239
The problem is supposed to be, has to be solved in a harder way when you just concentrate on something, either the bubble gum or the table, and you see, and you understand that no matter how much your task of dealing with it, what you're going to do, what you're thinking of, what you desire about it, and care about it, is no matter how much that varies, no matter how much your culture varies, and this is clearly his call, there is an impersonal one who's in your body, which is seeing it just the way that any other one would see it, even primates and so forth.

374
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,600
That's the claim.

375
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:02,519
And what always amazes me is how hard it seems to be for anybody to accept this.

376
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:08,839
To me, it seems just incredibly obvious that we perceive the same way as all sorts of things.

377
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:30,599
I just remember, and maybe this is relevant, a brilliant professor at MIT, famous once, Gary Lexen, who wrote the famous paper with the frog's eye, held the frog's brain, who found the first to plug into a particular neuron and see that it was firing when there was a black spot in the visual view of the field that they saw.

378
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:38,880
But Lecum said, in another context, how amazingly cross-species perception is.

379
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:41,040
And his example was sort of interesting.

380
00:33:41,360 --> 00:34:01,199
He said that in order to look, to save being eaten, the viceroy butterfly gets evolved to look like the monarch butterfly, would take, and it looks that way to the birds, and it looks that way to us.

381
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,800
We can't tell viceroy through monarchs, and neither can the bird.

382
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:08,639
That's an example of how cross-species perception is.

383
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,759
It seems to have the same.

384
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:16,799
I don't know if it has the same size and shape and color for the bird as it does for us, but it certainly has the same shape and size and color.

385
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,840
And it isn't really identical to the viceroy.

386
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,680
I mean, these two butterflies don't look so much alike that you couldn't tell them apart.

387
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,360
They just managed to look enough alike so birds can't tell them apart.

388
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,599
And if you know how to look, you can tell.

389
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,040
So that's important.

390
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:38,160
What's important is that they look a lot alike to birds and to us and fool the birds.

391
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:53,359
What I want to say about this is that Merloponte thinks it's just obvious that perception of objects of their shape, of their size, and of their color goes way across species and absolutely across cultures and tasks.

392
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,599
And why do you all find that so strange?

393
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,080
And I have to keep citing the body schema.

394
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:08,440
The one that's assuming me, the one that sees in me sees in the same as it says too, and that's the Merloponte picture.

395
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,719
Yeah, because you see the thing doesn't say that.

396
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,079
No, I don't think it is because of the body's schema.

397
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:26,999
It would be a task, but because the body's schema has in it the knowledge of the world and is always knowing how far we're deviating from the optimal, the body scheme, the desk or the bubblegum or the butterfly stays stable.

398
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:27,639
Yeah.

399
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:29,799
Okay, I'm going to go on.

400
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,879
I don't see a problem there yet.

401
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,999
Although I see the problem that I haven't convinced anybody yet with that question.

402
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:37,959
I think you mentioned two terms that I don't think are worth mentioning.

403
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,680
I'm heard you mentioned, I don't know if I see the kind of attention, motivation.

404
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:44,199
I try to not mention them.

405
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:44,360
Yes.

406
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,039
I mean, I think they're inequal to this problem.

407
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,200
I think they are not inequal to this.

408
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:50,999
And why?

409
00:35:50,999 --> 00:35:57,800
Because attention and motivation are individual, so they can't be in the one that thinks in the us.

410
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,119
What?

411
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,679
You don't think the attention and motivation are pre-human confusion?

412
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:21,560
They're pre-human, all right, but you have your attention and motivation, presumably, and I have my attention and motivation, whereas your body schema and my body schema is something that takes chairs or tables or trees and gives them the stable shape and stuff, independent of any particular person's particular attention and particular motivation.

413
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:24,119
Would that be getting too awful and how to get rid of it?

414
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,720
Well, it would be just getting non-impersonal.

415
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:35,880
I mean, there is an impersonal thing in our body, and it hasn't anything to do with our interest, our agency, our tasks, and our culture.

416
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,320
That's what he said.

417
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:58,840
I want to convince you both that he says it and that he says it's right, and that it doesn't really violate anything you want to say, that on top of that, so to speak, you will also see this as an object with a certain use if you belong in this culture, and you will see it as, okay, look, I haven't got the culture, but I have a good transition.

418
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:00,919
Yeah?

419
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:06,159
It's a striking that a lot of birds, for example, birds of prey, have a much, much better vision than you do.

420
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:07,200
They're trying to get a little picture of the current.

421
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,879
I know, wonderful.

422
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,639
So, how can the optimal bridge for a bird be the same as what it is for us?

423
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:14,479
I mean, it has to be at a very different vision.

424
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,320
Ah, it doesn't say that it's the same, but that's interesting.

425
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,920
I think that's interesting and important.

426
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,280
We've got to get clear now.

427
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:35,920
When I say that it's an impersonal one and it's the same across all the cultures, I mean not that they've got the same perceptual capacities.

428
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:39,999
That's right.

429
00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:51,280
I want to say their impersonal body schema has a better optimal visual component than we do.

430
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:59,760
It's impersonal across all cultures that there will be an optimal visual component.

431
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,399
But of course, you're right, it's not going to look thus the same.

432
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:15,279
So, the stress should be, you're correcting something I said, that the correction should be on the impersonal, not the cross-cultural.

433
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:23,839
By that, I mean the important thing isn't that the one in us is the same as the one in the eagle and so forth.

434
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,280
That's cross-species.

435
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:36,720
The important thing is that the one in us has nothing to do with our interests, our desires, and our tasks, and the one in the eagle will have nothing to do with its interests and its desires and its paths.

436
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,159
And I think they will have a lot of global qualities in common.

437
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:44,400
But that's not the important thing to stress.

438
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:58,679
The impersonal thing to stress is that there is a way that every species would perceives objects at all perceives them in a way independent of their tasks and interests.

439
00:38:58,999 --> 00:39:03,640
Not that they all perceive them in the same way we do.

440
00:39:03,959 --> 00:39:07,959
Though I don't know how much how far to go with that, so I won't go.

441
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,879
You have to eventually.

442
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:13,159
Why?

443
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:15,800
Well, yeah, you can see the data, but there's a thing you can see there.

444
00:39:19,479 --> 00:39:20,360
That's true.

445
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,239
And I think maybe now Olivia backs me in the other direction.

446
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,880
I feel like a ping-pong ball in this discussion.

447
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:38,440
I mean, because he wants to say, he wants me to say, and that's true too, that there's this natural object, and in a certain way, the eagle is just getting a better look at it from a farther away thing than we are.

448
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,800
I think Marilyn Plantee, that's back to the butterflies again.

449
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:52,919
It may be, I mean, it is the same rabbit, looking just like a rabbit from the top that he sees from way up there, and it's got the color it's got.

450
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,919
Now, maybe eagles are colorful.

451
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:00,520
I don't know if they are, then they just don't see a certain aspect of the natural state we do.

452
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:10,279
It's still the same rabbit with the same shape and the same size and some color or grayness that this eagle is seeing.

453
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:13,560
So it is cross-cultural a lot.

454
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:15,400
Maybe I gave too much away.

455
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,880
Anyway, there's nothing in personal life in your body.

456
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:22,759
Is that object that is that irrelevant?

457
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:31,080
So if it's human body, or human being versus an object, is that irrelevant at this stage of discussion?

458
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:49,520
That it will also, if it's a human, automatically draw on something in your system, which may in your visual system, in your brain, in your in your way, in your being in the world, depending on what set level, which makes you unable to not see it as a person.

459
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:52,720
That we'll get to in the chapter on being with others.

460
00:40:52,720 --> 00:41:00,799
But people also have a stable size and color and shape and so forth.

461
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,120
And it doesn't override that, that you see them as people.

462
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:09,600
They don't stop looking like stable objects of perception.

463
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:10,959
That's the same point again.

464
00:41:10,959 --> 00:41:12,400
Well, and it's so cultural.

465
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:16,720
Well, it's related to more like the cultural point than the task point.

466
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,079
But it's probably another, you could probably add a fifth point.

467
00:41:22,479 --> 00:41:33,759
Not only is this perceptual object and the corporeal schema unaffected by the past, also unaffected by the culture.

468
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:40,719
And it's also unaffected by whether the object is a human being or an object or that I think.

469
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,719
But I have no word about that.

470
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:48,080
When we read the being with others chapter, let's keep that in mind.

471
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,719
There's no doubt that it makes a big.

472
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:58,079
And I don't think it makes a difference in the impersonal body schema that it is a person.

473
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,399
It's just another object figure.

474
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:15,440
Okay, relative to the conflict, I made up an example, and maybe it's going to bonfire on me like the bubblegum one did, because I was trying to find, but there must be something right in what I'm saying, but I don't know what it is yet.

475
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,080
I'm trying to find this double thing where we're both responding.

476
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:31,400
I tried to say to the task, and that feeling always nonetheless the tension toward the optimal that keeps the object stable private in a culture.

477
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:40,280
I mean, where you can have all kinds of differences, but I've just taken extreme difference, how you deal with sacred objects in the culture.

478
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,079
And I'm making up a story that I think is probably true.

479
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:55,160
You're not supposed to go too near the Torah, and you're certainly not supposed to touch the Torah, so you've got to stand at a respectful distance from it, and you would, and you will if you're in a Hebrew culture.

480
00:42:55,159 --> 00:42:57,159
But it seems obvious to me.

481
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:05,400
You will feel that you would get a better look if you could go closer and a better, even better grip on it if you could take hold of it.

482
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:15,560
And that isn't, that's not incompatible with the sense that it's the kind of thing that is sacred and you can't come near it.

483
00:43:15,959 --> 00:43:19,160
I think you'd have these two things at once.

484
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:21,639
And why would you have to have these two things at once?

485
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:30,440
Because the Torah doesn't stop having a shape and a size and a color and a weight that's constant, but you put weight in there.

486
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:40,440
That's constant, whether it's got this higher order sacred thing that inhibits you from actually getting a better grip on it.

487
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:50,599
And I want to say because the crucial thing is that the impersonal body schema isn't committed to getting to feeling unhappy when it doesn't have the optimal grip on it.

488
00:43:50,599 --> 00:44:00,999
That is, it feels the tension, it feels the imbalance, it senses that it would be better, he could get it to have a better grip on the object some closer and over there and so forth.

489
00:44:00,999 --> 00:44:03,240
But that can be overridden.

490
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,479
That doesn't change anything that that can be overridden.

491
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,759
Yeah, Eric.

492
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:12,479
So, in this sample, you say or speak on yourself.

493
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,999
That's the wrong way to put it.

494
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:15,599
You don't like it.

495
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,479
You don't like it?

496
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,199
You feel a disequilibrium.

497
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:22,720
Yeah, when I said I'm happy, I just meant attention.

498
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,040
Attention, you can say.

499
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:26,479
A disequilibrium.

500
00:44:26,479 --> 00:44:26,880
What?

501
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,639
Oh, well, then that was a metaphor or something.

502
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,719
And don't take me literally.

503
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:38,720
I didn't think that the impersonal body schema was sort of getting out an impersonal handkerchief and my favorite size.

504
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,360
Yeah, go ahead.

505
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,679
There's paradise already there.

506
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:45,520
So then I recognize that.

507
00:44:45,999 --> 00:44:57,519
And you think there's a single difference from a sacredist, then you say that shape and you still feel disequilibrium.

508
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,800
Definitely.

509
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:05,360
You feel that you could see it better from over there, and everything else being equal, you'd rather be over there.

510
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,719
That's already putting a little too much personal stuff in it.

511
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,079
I can say that.

512
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:19,680
Everything else being equal, you'd rather be over there because you're just having, it makes you uneasy because you're sort of blurry and so forth.

513
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:21,440
Well, you could.

514
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,880
I think you'd be too busy looking at the sacred Torah to worry about it.

515
00:45:24,959 --> 00:45:33,920
It's a constitutive thing, the part of the science that is sacred because it's sacred because you're not completely you're not allowed to go for a good proceeding parent.

516
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:34,319
Right.

517
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:42,799
Okay, but you're always feeling, and but how conscious you are, I guess, of you know, this disequilibrium is a whole other question.

518
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:47,039
I I don't know how to dis say what to say about that.

519
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:49,680
Again, it's a possible paper topic, I imagine.

520
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:55,079
It can be very unnoticed and in the very much in the background.

521
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:59,640
I'll read you a quote in a little while where Merlot Franci says it's in the background.

522
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:09,400
And so you're not noticing it or paying attention to it unless for some funny reason you know it's breaking down for your life.

523
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,200
Anyway, normally it's in the background.

524
00:46:14,999 --> 00:46:15,640
Yeah.

525
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:43,560
I'm puzzled by this example because I think that in the for if the maximum growth of that object is keeping the tension so that you don't realize yourself as getting closer together adventure group because the object as it's all is to keep it you yeah but that's not a disagreement.

526
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:57,320
That just says there is no you have no feeling that you would want to say oh but I would get it by the group on an if all subject no there is no the the maximum growth on it is on the distance.

527
00:46:57,639 --> 00:46:59,879
Well that's that that doesn't feel right to me.

528
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:12,360
You want to say okay once it once you marry no if it's an object would be a little bit suppose you put it in a very dim light and you want to get the light brighter.

529
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,800
You're allowed to do that.

530
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:20,839
Suppose you had to watch it from way down there but you were allowed to get up this close but not closer.

531
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,360
You'd want to do that.

532
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:28,759
Suppose you were allowed to carry around the Torah on Sampa Torah and you have a right to carry around the Torah.

533
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,040
You go, wow, now I've really got a grip on it.

534
00:47:32,039 --> 00:47:34,840
So I think the other one is still in the background.

535
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:35,719
Think about it.

536
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,799
We talk about it more.

537
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:36,959
Yeah.

538
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:47,359
The cultural situation depends on being a best volume situation.

539
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:58,159
Because the because if you do that, you've not reached the maximal quote scheme, right?

540
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,880
That will be respectful to the building.

541
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:01,440
Right.

542
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,800
So it it does it depends on the.

543
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:13,999
That's what Olene was sort of saying that if that is said sacred, part of it is that it blocks your natural tendency to get up a certain way.

544
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,599
They couldn't be that dependent.

545
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:25,200
So they said, on the one hand.

546
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,479
It was surprising.

547
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:26,959
Go ahead.

548
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:33,679
So obviously that means supposedly the police demonstrates it.

549
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,239
I see.

550
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,119
I see you have to.

551
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:41,039
Otherwise, if it wasn't independent in that kind of point, then the whole thing is.

552
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:45,119
It wouldn't work.

553
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,159
It's kind of blocked your tendency to want to pick it up.

554
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:48,479
Yeah.

555
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:59,200
Personal motivations are certainly affected by the culture, so your attention can shift.

556
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,280
They're blocked by this impersonal, what am I trying to say?

557
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:10,559
This impersonal ability for maximal grip is being blocked by these personal motivations in this case that are affected by the culture.

558
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:10,799
Yeah.

559
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:16,320
You know, though I like to think of it in terms of this impersonal ability for a maximum grip, you don't have to fulfill this maximum time.

560
00:49:16,479 --> 00:49:17,360
But you have to feel.

561
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:30,119
I mean, you have to, because it's this this impersonal thing happening in you, that this tension, this disequilibrium, this unbalance, this pull to see it come over there, you can then override the pull by this culture.

562
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:34,440
I can just write the sacred law that says I should not be close to the Torah.

563
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:35,239
That's right.

564
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,999
But that's what we're all saying.

565
00:49:36,999 --> 00:49:38,599
And whether we're agreeing about that.

566
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:40,360
Maybe, I don't know if you're not, you might not do this.

567
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,639
You think that's the way I'm putting it out?

568
00:49:41,639 --> 00:49:48,279
Like your personal motivation in a way blocks this impersonal ability for a maximal grip in this case.

569
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:51,639
Yes, but it blocks doing it.

570
00:49:51,639 --> 00:50:00,199
But it doesn't block, it can't, because this impersonal thought and schema saying, boy, this is a tension.

571
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,120
I mean, how clearly it says that I don't know.

572
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:03,319
This is an optimal.

573
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,479
You'd be better off if I were over there.

574
00:50:05,479 --> 00:50:07,800
But, yeah, and you block.

575
00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:12,679
Personal motivation causes your attention to shift such that you don't fulfill this ability to get a maximal grip.

576
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:16,840
But I keep going to stress, but it's going to turn out to be very important later.

577
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:19,479
We just don't fulfill it.

578
00:50:19,479 --> 00:50:21,800
The important thing to stress is we can just feel it.

579
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:28,199
I mean, the body schema goes right on saying this is an unbalanced, this is a disequilibrium, this is a tension.

580
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,599
Yeah, I would be holding over here.

581
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,679
This is me.

582
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:33,959
Yes, that's right.

583
00:50:33,959 --> 00:50:35,959
That's what distance is, he says.

584
00:50:35,959 --> 00:50:37,159
It's the what?

585
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:41,479
The fence that I'm not as close as I would like to be.

586
00:50:41,479 --> 00:50:42,999
That's what distance is.

587
00:50:42,999 --> 00:50:49,800
And where close means getting a better grip, where the impersonal body schema could get a better grip.

588
00:50:50,599 --> 00:50:52,280
Okay, James and then Eric.

589
00:50:52,999 --> 00:50:58,360
I mean, would you think about the optimal grip when the Torah would be the one pulled up really well, or were you going to read the writing?

590
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,959
Ah, interesting.

591
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,079
These are the puzzling things like the bubble gun.

592
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:09,679
The optimal grip on the Torah, depending on whether you were interested, I guess, and now it will help interest you.

593
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,360
Ah, but the question is.

594
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:15,039
No, it's the bubble gum example.

595
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:15,920
No, it's just the.

596
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,800
I'm trying to go below the level of culture.

597
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,039
Right.

598
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,679
It's the bubble gum.

599
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:23,119
It's the shifting task example.

600
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,599
I'm saying that.

601
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,279
You're making it harder.

602
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:35,760
You're running up the temperature of the bubblegum example, which makes it even harder for me to cope with it.

603
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,920
I see that that's right.

604
00:51:38,559 --> 00:52:01,920
I don't know where this will lead, but I think you have to say, think of the phenomenon, remember, that it's the case that you may be interested in the whole object and its beautiful pace and all that, and then you will feel that you can't get closer and you shouldn't get closer and you're really seeing it as well as you because it requires to be seen when you can't get closer.

605
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,840
But you feel all that anyway.

606
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,160
But now, suppose you're trying to read it.

607
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:12,400
Well, it seems to me that we never said that you aren't directed by your task.

608
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,999
Now, it's just, I still think it's like the bubble gum example, basically.

609
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,599
Now your task is to read it.

610
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:24,080
Well, it's got a perceptual page with perceptual print on it, and there's an optimal distance from that.

611
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:33,840
And that doesn't mean that your task has changed the impersonal body schema, which will do the job for you if your task is to see the whole object.

612
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:37,280
It'll do the job for you if your task is to read a page of the object.

613
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,079
It'll be, so it's okay, I think.

614
00:52:40,479 --> 00:52:42,639
It doesn't challenge the basic points.

615
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:48,159
The writing elements are both equally essential to this being the object, but it is.

616
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:55,400
And I don't think there's any neutral way of describing that one of those two standpoints, one from which you can read, one from which you can see the whole thing, is figurative.

617
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:02,440
There's an optimal grip on whatever is the figure, I think, in your experience.

618
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:09,159
And that happens mostly, or maybe all you probably couldn't say that there's an optimal grip on the object.

619
00:53:09,159 --> 00:53:10,360
That's what you're saying.

620
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,239
And that's right.

621
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:22,680
I mean, because you can certainly get inside the object, and you get an alternative grip on a house when you see it from the front, and another optimal grip on the house if you see the interior and the furniture.

622
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:26,600
So we shouldn't say that there's not just one optimal.

623
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:42,520
But again, the phenomena says, okay, the important thing is that there's an impersonal body schema which will kick in and stabilize your perceptual experience on the inside of the house or the outside of the house.

624
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:45,240
So we better not say an optimal grip on the house.

625
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:50,120
We better just say your task will determine something is bigger for you.

626
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:58,440
And at that point, your optimal, the optimal stuff in your impersonal body will take over and stabilize.

627
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:58,920
Is that okay?

628
00:53:59,159 --> 00:54:02,039
So it is not in the way that we're not.

629
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:02,920
Right, right, right.

630
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,119
We're sorting it out.

631
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:06,759
It's relative to the task, what is the figure?

632
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:10,760
And that's part of the existential being in the world aspect of it.

633
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:17,320
But it's also your body has an impersonal task, namely getting an optimal grip.

634
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,479
And it's also relative to that.

635
00:54:19,639 --> 00:54:22,919
That's also called existential and being in the world.

636
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:23,559
Yeah, Rich.

637
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:28,920
So on the one hand, microphone grip is supposed to accomplish the dirty work of preserving constancy.

638
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:29,479
Yes.

639
00:54:29,479 --> 00:54:32,599
And so no one wants to deny that we experience constancies.

640
00:54:32,599 --> 00:54:43,679
But we have to distinguish between the constancies that are in the background as opposed to the maximum grip of the particular object that I'm paying attention to, and it's the object of my past.

641
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:50,559
And so we can only shift our past, and no one is saying it when you shift past that the background constancy disappears.

642
00:54:50,559 --> 00:55:01,440
It's just that even though, so I don't have a sense of the colors around me changing when I'm shifting past, but then there is a problem getting a maximum grip of the color of this one object.

643
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:05,600
So there's the example of buying a tie in unnatural light.

644
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:11,840
And then to really get a maximum grip of the color of this type, really just looking at it and looking at it next to different things.

645
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,840
And then I go outside in sunlight.

646
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:19,039
And then really in the sunlight, you know, if ever there are a maximum grip of the color of this object.

647
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:19,920
That's right.

648
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:28,159
And so even though I don't experience the object is changing color, so even when it's in the background, there's a color constancy.

649
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:34,799
There's still a sense of the maximum grip of the object in the periphery in the backgrounds and the maximum grip that I experienced.

650
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,079
That's absolutely right.

651
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:37,360
And I'm going to take that off.

652
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,959
So these are two disciplines.

653
00:55:38,959 --> 00:55:40,559
Yeah, that's point four.

654
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:47,839
That's because that's related to the issue I said that was important, whether you ever needed to get the maximum grip.

655
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:55,840
And so really, this is the question of whether the true color needs ever to be something you see.

656
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,240
Maybe you can't get anywhere that's like to see it in that.

657
00:55:58,559 --> 00:55:59,759
That's a separate question, though.

658
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:05,520
For now, I just want to emphasize how it seems like there's a background and the foreground.

659
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:08,159
And I guess there's a question though.

660
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:14,079
On your understanding of maximum grip, is there maximum grip happening all the time, and that's what's preserving us.

661
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,400
The the stats of deviation of the one.

662
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:16,559
Yes.

663
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,759
And that's in the background.

664
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,360
That's why we got all the constancy.

665
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:19,679
Yes.

666
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:24,280
But you also would accept if we just look at a phenomenon that sometimes we are Yes.

667
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:28,039
And in that case it seems like that would be for you that would also be a case of case.

668
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:30,999
What you're saying about I was looking at a thing.

669
00:56:30,999 --> 00:56:34,199
I'm like forgetting the distinction between maximum grip and optimal grip.

670
00:56:34,519 --> 00:56:35,559
No, I don't think so.

671
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:36,440
I think they're the same.

672
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:37,799
I don't think that's going to help.

673
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:42,999
What Rick is saying is well further there's a new interesting issue there.

674
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:44,519
There are all interesting issues.

675
00:56:44,519 --> 00:57:01,799
What that interesting issue is, is that the marrow punch is quite clear, but I won't go and try to grab the page and read it, that the optimal grip is a kind of optimal that takes into account various factors and kind of does a Pareto optimal on them, if you know what that is.

676
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:08,360
I mean it tries to find the position in which you get the most of all of them without getting all of any of them.

677
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:28,839
And now Rick is saying, yes, but you could shift that too if your interest changed, where instead of trying to get the optimal that gets the best combination of seeing the texture, seeing the size, seeing the color, seeing the shape, that you just put them all into trying to optimize one of them.

678
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:29,959
That's what you're saying.

679
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:31,479
And you could do that.

680
00:57:31,479 --> 00:57:33,320
And what about that?

681
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,759
Well, that's right.

682
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:38,600
And your impersonal schema is going to go on anyway.

683
00:57:38,599 --> 00:57:40,999
That's just a a refinement, but it's an interesting one.

684
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:58,599
I think like you shouldn't be privileging like the natural um or natural conception of things and natural things.

685
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:15,119
And when you're talking about maximum grip, you need to take into consideration um human significance if you're doing with respect to our being in the world because it includes all these cultural and human institutions, and that's why it involves everything else, all the biological stuff, all the natural stuff, all the spatial stuff.

686
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:17,519
Well, yeah, I see what you're saying.

687
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:22,080
And I just want to say, for Mero-Ponty, that's interesting that you'll get there.

688
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,359
And then he gets to the freaking chapter and the others and so forth.

689
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:29,519
There he is, so to speak, on top of this basic level.

690
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,999
All these other, and the basic level is not trans.

691
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:36,800
The impersonal one, this basic level is real.

692
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,559
You know, if you're deceiving it to be human, it's going to have great human aspects to you.

693
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:45,679
Well, now that's the point four, but we might as well skip to it because we're going to get it out of the way in a hurry.

694
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:55,599
Point four is, yes, most of the time, this thing looks if you're in a Christian culture as a creature of God, and if you're in Homeric Greece, it looks like something that wooshed up, and so forth.

695
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:01,200
There's a different way things look in each culture, and all kinds of differences.

696
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:32,239
And Merrill-Ponty thinks that, given his sort of top-down holism, most of the time, it's already got not only this impersonal list of stuff, which I get tired of repeating, but it's also got the perceptual, it looks like a creature of God, or it looks like something that wooshed up, or it looks like something that needs nurturing if you're in Athenian Greece, or it looks like subjects and objects if you're us.

697
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,160
That's true, all right.

698
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:38,400
But all that Mero-Ponty wants to say two things about that.

699
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:49,360
One, that that presupposes as its basis that you get a stable perceptual object first, and then without that, you can't have it looking like a creature of God or anything else.

700
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:56,119
Second, and this is this funny passage which I said I would get out of the way in a hurry, is the Foster Le Concord comment.

701
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:06,119
I'm going to just skip to it because that will, I just want to do more before you see the phone is not wrong.

702
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:06,519
Yeah, yeah.

703
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:10,119
He goes through sense.

704
01:00:10,119 --> 01:00:15,320
He says first he isn't his phone, and then he can change his life with colors and good, good, yeah, yeah.

705
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:19,719
So, um, he's just making a point that all the projections all there.

706
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,959
Yes, but that's right.

707
01:00:21,959 --> 01:00:37,240
And you, I don't know what you're saying, except probably that the cultural significance is important, and not only is it important what we share with the higher primates and maybe the birds, but it's important that what we share with all human beings, and even more, it's maybe very important what we share with the people in our culture.

708
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:38,599
That's fine.

709
01:00:39,159 --> 01:00:48,440
But what interests him is to, because he's writing the book, The Phenomenology of Perception, to get this clear about this impersonal body schema level.

710
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,720
And this isn't just because he happens to be interested in that.

711
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:57,160
But he thinks that that's fundamental in the sense that if you don't have that, you can't have the others.

712
01:00:57,159 --> 01:00:59,799
And you could have that without having the others.

713
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,039
That's just what the wall is supposed to show.

714
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:10,600
It's a philosophical point, not that the gritty wall and the Flashlight are supposed to be as interesting as the book.

715
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:16,199
But that it's a w it's a it's a relation of founding, as Husserl would call it.

716
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:20,120
That is, you can't have any of these others without having this perceptual one.

717
01:01:20,119 --> 01:01:24,360
You can have the perceptual one without having the others, although that's a weird case.

718
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:29,800
And you should know that, and it should be philosophically important that there is this basic level.

719
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:30,199
Yeah.

720
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:38,320
Going back to your point of the polygon.

721
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:48,720
So if you say that you get a maximum grid on the figure, then I think you need to get a maximum grid on yourself, which is not the same as very.

722
01:01:48,959 --> 01:02:05,840
Maybe, then I shouldn't, we shouldn't maybe say it the way Rich said it, but the phenomena is we can take out and put as a figure on a background some particular natural property of the object, the tie in this case, namely its color.

723
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:16,880
And we do that by focusing on the color and trying to get the optimal for seeing that color, even if the shape of the tie doesn't turn out to be important anymore, or the texture or the material.

724
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:22,479
And those constants will be in the background in the sense that we're not noticing it.

725
01:02:22,479 --> 01:02:23,999
And that's all he wants to say.

726
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:25,360
Let me go on.

727
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:30,239
So because one big deal important issue we haven't even gotten to, or maybe two.

728
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,840
Let's do the culture first.

729
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,039
I think I finished that.

730
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:34,400
Good, I finished that.

731
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:37,920
And you've done the wall in the phosphoron core.

732
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,760
Let's say we finish that.

733
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:42,559
That was number three.

734
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:47,679
Can we experience the natural thing alone without any relevance to the task and so forth?

735
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:49,680
Merrill Ponty's answer is yes.

736
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:53,759
And that's important mainly because of this notion of foundationalness.

737
01:02:54,240 --> 01:03:09,360
Now, there's another whole big important issue that I raised, and it's been in the background of this discussion, that we got to get it into the foreground, though I didn't worry too much about the time because it's something that Sean is a specialist on, and it will come up again.

738
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,519
But I think we should start thinking about it.

739
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:20,080
Do we need to experience the maximum grip to experience stable objects as having a constant size and shape and color?

740
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:30,999
Because we can only experience this constant if we experience the current one, the current way it looks, as deviations from the optimal.

741
01:03:30,999 --> 01:03:31,959
See the problem.

742
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:42,679
Don't you have to know what the thing looks like at its best, so to speak, in order to experience it as not as clear as it should be?

743
01:03:42,679 --> 01:03:49,479
That I get a clearer view over there, that I could see this shape better from over here, that I could, and so forth.

744
01:03:49,639 --> 01:04:00,040
Don't you have to have already had an experience of the optimal, maximal, whatever, I think there's no difference there, the optimal look of it.

745
01:04:00,039 --> 01:04:12,279
A look of it in which you don't feel, let's describe that optimal, any tension, any unbalance, any pull to be anywhere else, or to change the lighting.

746
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:19,080
The lighting is just the right brightness, the lighting is just the right color, you're just the right distance, and it just feels fine.

747
01:04:19,079 --> 01:04:25,720
You could have such an experience, but do you have to have such an experience to get the sense of deviation from it?

748
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:33,959
Well, that's a tough one, but the answer has got to be no, because it would have weird results otherwise.

749
01:04:34,679 --> 01:04:43,160
If you just didn't happen to have ever had the optimal experience of the such and such, you couldn't have a stable experience of the such and such.

750
01:04:44,039 --> 01:04:51,959
But then you get this funny question, but how do you know what the optimal is if you never had an experience of it?

751
01:04:51,959 --> 01:04:57,800
So you can understand, feel your present experience is not as good as it could be.

752
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:11,199
I guess the answer to that is supposed to be, and that's why I think it's so interesting and important, the impersonal corporal schema knows somehow it's got in it a whole understanding of the world already.

753
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:18,079
And then therefore it's got an understanding of what this object would look like from the optimal, even if it's never seen it from the optimal.

754
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:22,640
Olivia has not even re encouraged me because it seems like an outrageous thesis.

755
01:05:22,639 --> 01:05:36,560
But I think Merlopon T would just say that, look, that's how it has to be, because we know that people can experience stable objects with stable shapes and properties and colors and all that, who will never see them under the optimal conditions.

756
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:58,959
And therefore, we can know that our mind schema has already got built into it this prehistory, before we were ever born already, of an understanding of the properties of natural objects and how they would look from wherever, even if you've never seen them from wherever.

757
01:05:58,959 --> 01:06:00,319
That's built in.

758
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:01,359
It's amazing.

759
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,400
And true problems.

760
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:02,639
Yeah.

761
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,159
The norms, right?

762
01:06:08,479 --> 01:06:08,639
Right.

763
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:09,679
Right.

764
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:13,920
You seem like supposing that we have to represent the ideal situation.

765
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:14,719
That's right.

766
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:18,079
And that seems in general when we talk about norms.

767
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:30,719
We think that you follow a rule and try to get things right without necessarily representing what the rule is.

768
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,320
Or what the idea is we get it.

769
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:32,800
Right.

770
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:37,280
Do we have to have a description or an experience of what it would be to get it right?

771
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:45,440
You don't seem to need a general description of what it would be to give advice in order to be governed by 10 mega senten mainstays getting advice in general.

772
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:45,839
Right.

773
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:47,919
But I'm not sure we're saying the same thing.

774
01:06:47,919 --> 01:06:51,199
But let me say what I think is, to me, the important thing.

775
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,719
Where am I in Christology?

776
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:59,320
It took pages to say it, but I'm going to try to do it in brief because Sean will do it anyway.

777
01:07:00,919 --> 01:07:12,199
So, this is, by the way, what I'm telling you now is the sense in which the body contains the logos of the world, the key for unlocking all experiences, even before you've had it.

778
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:17,239
And the point is that you don't need to experience the maximum grip.

779
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:23,320
What you always experience is the more or less deviation from the maximum.

780
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:33,799
And thanks to the way the body schema already has an understanding of the world, it gives you an answer that this is the best, or it would be better over there.

781
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:39,239
It gives you attention and sense of unbalance, or it doesn't.

782
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:50,999
I was just wrong when I said that you had to experience the maximum grip in order to experience the constants that are related to them.

783
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,479
It's just not so.

784
01:07:53,479 --> 01:08:00,119
And the clearest quote to where it's not so is on 350, which Sean picks out and makes a big fuss about.

785
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:03,959
And I'm going to refer you to that.

786
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,719
It gives a sense.

787
01:08:05,719 --> 01:08:07,400
No, no, wait, the real color.

788
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:07,959
Yeah.

789
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:08,759
Oh, yeah.

790
01:08:08,759 --> 01:08:10,919
Okay, yes, it's about five lines down.

791
01:08:10,919 --> 01:08:12,360
The real color.

792
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:30,200
Take Rick's story about the tie and the fact that you may never have seen the real color in the sense that, only in this peculiar sense now, that you never see the color under optimal conditions, the lighting, but yet you see the real color.

793
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,999
You saw the real color all along.

794
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,839
Because the real color isn't the color that you experience when you see it optimally.

795
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:49,199
The real color is what is in the background, giving you the experience that all the experiences you've had of that color so far are not optimal.

796
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:54,479
It gives you the sense of I could see it even better from there and see it even better from there.

797
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:59,280
Just to have that experience is already to, that is to see the real color.

798
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:05,679
You never have to see the optimal color in order to sense deviations from the optimal.

799
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:10,079
And as long as you're sensing deviations from the optimal, you're seeing the real color.

800
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:14,959
This is said on page seven, oh, sorry, line seven of 356.

801
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:20,320
The real color persists beneath appearances as the background beneath the figure.

802
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:27,759
That is not as a scene or thought of quality, but through a non-sensory presence.

803
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:36,479
Well, the non-sensory presence is the tension, is the feeling of unbalance, is the sense that I could see it even better over there.

804
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:39,440
As soon as you've got that, you've already seen it.

805
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:42,559
You already have seen the optimal color.

806
01:09:42,559 --> 01:09:45,919
I don't know how that's going to work with the tide, but it's supposed to work with the tie.

807
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:52,400
I just suggest, Brad, that you don't actually see the real color, that the real color is in a non-sensory effect.

808
01:09:52,639 --> 01:09:53,599
Well, that's right.

809
01:09:53,599 --> 01:09:54,160
That's good.

810
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,119
That's important.

811
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:55,519
Yes.

812
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,040
Okay, good.

813
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,039
Now you made the right distinction.

814
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:04,799
The complication, I've got, I mean, I'm trying to say everything at once, and that's a problem.

815
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:19,440
There's the real color in the sense that we, that is tied up with the optimal grip story that counts for all the deviations, is a color that you never see.

816
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,719
Like a magnet underneath talking human.

817
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,200
Right.

818
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:32,199
It's what is the nearest you come to ever seeing the real color is seeing the color in a way that you don't feel any tension anymore.

819
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:44,599
Now, that's then see there are two senses of optimal seeing the color because you can the color the red tie in the optimal conditions.

820
01:10:44,599 --> 01:10:53,079
And that means when the lighting is right, and that means basically when you don't feel any tension and that there's any place from which you could see it better.

821
01:10:53,719 --> 01:11:00,759
But that's not the sort of optimal color that Merloponte is interested in.

822
01:11:00,759 --> 01:11:06,519
The optimal color Merloponte is interested in is there whether you ever get that experience or not.

823
01:11:06,519 --> 01:11:10,759
That is, whether you ever get the color in the best conditions.

824
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:25,559
The optimal color is there in the background, drawing you to get the optimal experience and to not be satisfied without it, whether you ever get it head on, whether you ever get the optimal color in the other sense.

825
01:11:25,559 --> 01:11:38,519
Now, I could read you passages, and if John doesn't, I will, in which you can see that Merlot Ponty seems to be confused about this, in that sometimes he seems to be, I think he is confused about it.

826
01:11:38,519 --> 01:11:52,999
Sometimes he's, well, look at 370 and 371 is a place where you can, where he seems to say that the optimal is the maximum richness, whereas I just read you the passage from 356 where he says the optimal is the color.

827
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:57,160
There's always been the maximum between the real color we're getting in the background.

828
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:56,879
Right.

829
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:01,799
The optimal color, which is just kind of interesting.

830
01:12:01,799 --> 01:12:03,639
Keep your eye open to that.

831
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:08,160
I think so the real color is the same as the optimal color.

832
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:11,519
I think the optimal color is itself ambiguous.

833
01:12:11,839 --> 01:12:19,360
I think the optimal color is the name for what's pulling you toward lack of any tension.

834
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:25,599
But it's also the name for what you get when you, what you see when you get to the place where there's no tension.

835
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,799
But you're right.

836
01:12:26,799 --> 01:12:28,159
I'm only claiming this.

837
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:34,799
But look at here's a place of 371 where it's clear that the optimal is the maximum grip.

838
01:12:34,799 --> 01:12:37,280
But look at this, how confusing it is.

839
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:41,039
Rich, just what you're saying, what I would want to say too.

840
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:47,360
He says, I run through appearances and reach the real color or the real shape when my experience is at its maximum.

841
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,440
See how that messes up what you just said.

842
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:52,400
Well, no, because it's not the real color.

843
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:53,599
Ah, I see.

844
01:12:53,599 --> 01:12:54,719
That's what you want to say.

845
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:55,919
Good, let me go on.

846
01:12:55,919 --> 01:13:01,119
So the experience will reach a degree of clarity, a maximum richness.

847
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:04,639
And then that will be a culmination, an optimum balance.

848
01:13:04,639 --> 01:13:07,119
I'm just skimming through the paragraph.

849
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:12,959
It's my full coexistence with the phenomenon at the moment, then it's maximum articulation.

850
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:20,639
Okay, that's but then that is the problem, because he's calling that the real color.

851
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:25,759
And that real color is this maximum clarity story, right?

852
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:28,159
But those are now in 356.

853
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,999
But the color doesn't get clarity.

854
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:30,959
The colour is just bad.

855
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:31,919
It's just real.

856
01:13:31,919 --> 01:13:33,919
You get a clear colour.

857
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:41,599
Okay, but you, I see, you get a maximum experience of the color when, well, when there's no tension and so forth.

858
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:45,999
But the the but the real color is not.

859
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,839
All I originally wanted to do is correct into a real color?

860
01:13:49,919 --> 01:13:50,200
Yeah.

861
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:51,959
Oh, I see.

862
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,160
Well but there's a lot in there.

863
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:54,999
It says real color, right?

864
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:03,879
And but the real color, and I you think that that's not the same as the optimal, but here on top of 371, the real color is my experience.

865
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:04,440
Yeah.

866
01:14:06,599 --> 01:14:06,759
Yeah.

867
01:14:07,639 --> 01:14:11,400
There's more than one situation in which you might increase zero tension with the tie.

868
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:24,440
If you're buying the tie, if you were at work and there's lots of windows in your office, so you've been to lots of denser light, you want to take it outside to see what color it is, but if you're buying it to where the dinner parties where you're going to be indoors all the time, the tension will be at zero when you're in the store.

869
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:25,079
No.

870
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:26,440
No, I mean, no, no, no, no, no.

871
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:29,799
That would get that would get to trump the impersonal body schema.

872
01:14:30,679 --> 01:14:31,799
It'll be impersonal.

873
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:35,639
So it has to be anyone, not just anyone in the store or out.

874
01:14:35,639 --> 01:14:51,320
There's one level at which, and maybe it's wrong, but the body schema has built into it a sense of what the optimal color is, and even if you never experience it, you're experiencing all these deviations from it.

875
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,160
Now, I submit we have to stop it.

876
01:14:53,160 --> 01:15:05,959
I mean, I do keep your eyes open now in this chapter, but I submit that to these confused in a way that's not horrible as long as you keep it straight, between two senses of the real color.

877
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:15,879
What you experience when there is no tension and you have an optimal grip could be called the real color.

878
01:15:15,879 --> 01:15:24,440
Or what gives you a sense that wherever you are, these are the optimal grip could be called the real color.

879
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:33,639
And even if you never experience it, it's what you are always experiencing yourself as either far from or near from or at.

880
01:15:33,639 --> 01:15:36,440
And that could be something you never experience.

881
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:38,239
Both are there.

882
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:41,360
And both we just keep in mind the phenomena.

883
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:47,919
It's true that some optimal color is guiding you impersonally all the time whether you ever see it or not.

884
01:15:47,919 --> 01:15:51,280
And you can call that the real color in the background.

885
01:15:51,280 --> 01:16:00,959
Or some color is the color you get when you get the best lighting conditions and distance conditions and everything that your impersonal body schema knows are the right ones.

886
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:05,119
And then you see the color, you can call that the real color.
