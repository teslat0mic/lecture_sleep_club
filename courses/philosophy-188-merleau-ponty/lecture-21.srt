1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,679
Well, well then let's go into the movement chapter, or a part of the space chapter.

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,199
And we're starting with 312.

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,959
The real starting is on 311.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:19,319
I mean as you realize there are these spaces in the book which correspond to changing of subjects.

5
00:00:19,639 --> 00:00:36,039
Incidentally in the French copy there in the in the table of contents there are a list of these topics which they have put in the German translation in these spaces which is very helpful as if in that space it would say movement.

6
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:47,319
So if anybody reads German and that got translated into the Dutch I now know and so you get a lot more perspicuous grasp of it if you had that.

7
00:00:47,319 --> 00:00:51,399
But there's no reason I'm afraid why any of us I'm going to try to get the German.

8
00:00:51,400 --> 00:01:03,080
If I get the German then I'll be able or the Dutch even Martin I could then tell you the names of these how it maps the French table of contents on these sections that would be interesting that would be valuable.

9
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,439
Okay let's do that.

10
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:20,840
So what I'm going to hand out I promise as soon as I get time which is probably this coming weekend is the detailed table of contents that's in the French translated into English and how that maps pages on how that maps onto this.

11
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:50,239
Okay but boy is this I know you have this feeling constantly being in the wamp okay on 311 just worth reviewing just minimally because it's so absolutely fundamental and oddly enough there seem to be maybe not any more after two lectures have gone, still people who thought that the maximal grip story was not the basic story in the phenomenology of perception, and I was sort of making a fuss about it.

12
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:57,440
And you can understand why somebody might think that, because the phrase maximal grip only occurs about three times in the whole book.

13
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:12,000
But everything about equilibrium, getting a grip on the world, lowering attention, not paying attention, but lowering the pull of things away from getting the optimal that Sean talked about.

14
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,359
All of that's in there.

15
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:23,679
And he says it on 311, for instance, in what I think might be a new term, but I'm looking now at the middle of the first paragraph on 311.

16
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:37,439
But we saw above, above is all the discussion of the orientation, of size, of shape that we've been talking, Sean was talking about.

17
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:43,680
We saw above that in reality, the vertical and the horizontal, nobody talked about that much.

18
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:45,040
That's the inverting lenses.

19
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,279
That's so long and complicated that I think nobody wants to touch it, neither Vienna.

20
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:57,280
But the vertical and horizontal, ultimately defined as the best hold our body could take on the world.

21
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,280
That's the optimal grip.

22
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:14,799
And beneath the height, as relations between objects are derivative and viewed in their primary significance, breadth and height, as relations between objects are derived and viewed in their primary significance, they too are existential dimensions.

23
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:17,280
Maybe that's a new phrase, I'm not sure.

24
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:33,439
But existential dimension means that they are aspects of objects which can only appear to an engaged, embodied consciousness.

25
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,680
That's the other big theme.

26
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:38,080
I mean, these are not two separate things, of course.

27
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:54,679
One theme is there's a lot the objective observer misses, can't understand constant size, constant shape, depth, distance, orientation.

28
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:57,479
I'm missing the one.

29
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:18,439
Anyway, can't understand those, you only can understand those as deviations from an optimal grip, and you can only understand that if you're an engaged being with a body that moves toward and is sensitive to the need for an optimal grip.

30
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:20,680
And that's existential phenomenology.

31
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:39,160
That's the claim that these aspects of objects are only given to or only experienced above by an engaged, embodied, active receiver.

32
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:47,960
And that's just, I keep telling you the overall story because I think it's so hard to keep track of the overall story in all the details.

33
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:53,479
Okay, now we're going to go into one of the details, starting on 312.

34
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,039
So now we want to understand movement, it says.

35
00:04:58,359 --> 00:05:02,999
And we know already what the form of the answer is going to be.

36
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,440
The form, just what I said.

37
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:14,679
The form of the answer is going to be that you can only understand movement when you relate it in some way or other to the tendency we have to get an optimal grip.

38
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:20,200
How that particular game is going to be played in this chapter is always new, always different.

39
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:26,880
But on 312 at the top, he's talking about the existential dimensions without naming it.

40
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:44,640
He says in the middle of the top sentence on 312, we shall have to rediscover beneath the objective idea of movement a pre-objective experience from which it borrows its significance, and in which movement still leads to the person perceiving it is a variation of the subject's hold on his world.

41
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,679
I mean that's race will just come up always.

42
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,280
And I guess that adds a new element to what I wanted to say.

43
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,679
It's always on the pre-objective.

44
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:55,280
That was what's implied.

45
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:06,640
The pre-objective story is always a story about the grip on the world and always tied up with involvement in the world and moving toward a better grip on the world.

46
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,040
That's what gets you the pre-objective pre-conceptual phenomenon.

47
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:25,519
That is, the phenomena that you get that way can't be described from the objective, detached, another Sean term, determinate description of it.

48
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,119
Indeterminate, add that.

49
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:37,999
I mean, it's all the indeterminate comes in too, insofar as you are an embodied, engaged being moving to get a better grip on the world.

50
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,920
That that gives you more or less determinacy as you get a better or less good grip.

51
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:50,000
So the hold on the world.

52
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,800
Now, now, with your book open, I give you guidelines again.

53
00:06:54,799 --> 00:07:08,400
If you haven't figured it out for yourself, it stops being marlow-pon p after the word world, and you get the objectivist description of what goes on in movement.

54
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:16,760
That goes on clear to, well, it goes on in one form to the bottom of the page.

55
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:20,360
And then it looks like Merleau-Ponty is going to tell us something.

56
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,039
He says, well, that doesn't give us a movement.

57
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:36,840
The objectivist got into paradoxes of Zeno-like sort, where a completely determinate object is occupying always some completely determinate place, and then there's no movement.

58
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:43,800
So movement seems to vanish from a determinate, objectivist description.

59
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:46,840
And he says that at the bottom of 312.

60
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:54,280
And then he goes on and goes back to not giving his view.

61
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,880
But more of it, then he goes on back to Zeno's paradoxes.

62
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:07,720
And so that whole next paragraph is about how you can't account for movement from this objectivist point of view.

63
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:18,760
And see if I can the end of that paragraph, it's impossible to conceive in one and the same moving body, the very act of transition, which always occurs between two instances.

64
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:28,440
This is his criticism of the objectivist in whatever proximity to each other we choose them.

65
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:38,120
So that in thinking clearly about movement, I do not understand how it can ever begin for me and to be given to me as a phenomenon.

66
00:08:38,439 --> 00:08:41,400
And of not Merlot-Ponty.

67
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,440
He's now reduced the objectivist position to hopelessness.

68
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:47,720
You remember the dialectic.

69
00:08:47,719 --> 00:08:51,240
I mean, it says there's always for him two wrong positions.

70
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,760
Usually it's intellectualist and empiricist that you've gotten used to knowing.

71
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,319
Oddly enough, in this chapter, it's not.

72
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,919
It's objectivist versus Vestaltist, which is very sort of disoriented.

73
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:08,079
The new dialectic, two new bad guys, and a new synthesis.

74
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:11,840
I'll show you the passage where he thumbs that up.

75
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:15,680
The empiricist doesn't show up in this chapter, as far as I can see.

76
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,640
I don't know why.

77
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,840
There ought to be an empiricist story about movement, which ought to be wrong, according to him.

78
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,080
But if it was here, I missed it.

79
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:26,559
Okay, so now he goes on.

80
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:28,720
We're on 3.13.

81
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:30,240
Wait, let me see if I've got...

82
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,400
Yeah, so now he goes on, and yet I walk.

83
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:46,799
I have the experience of movement in spite of the demands and dilemmas of clear thought, which means in defiance of all reason, that I perceive movement without any identical moving object, without any external landmark, and without any relativity.

84
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,959
And that's going to be mysterious.

85
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,640
But right now he's introducing not his own view.

86
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,160
Oh, well, I see.

87
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,080
That is Merrill-Ponty's view.

88
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,120
I wasn't up to that when I read it through.

89
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,599
That's not Merloponte, that's Vestalta.

90
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,360
And I hadn't realized yet that he wasn't in the Gestalt business.

91
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,559
So now the Gestalt says to the objectivist, no, no, you're wrong.

92
00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:21,360
We can perceive movement even when there's nothing that moves and no framework against which it moves, just pure movement.

93
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,959
And you would think, gee, I don't know.

94
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,479
I can't believe there's such a thing.

95
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,760
How could we perceive that?

96
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,360
Well, you see it every day.

97
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,280
It's called the psi phenomenon.

98
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,520
In here, there's a funny little letter at one point which looks like a Norwegian.

99
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,240
Oh, it isn't the right Greek letter.

100
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,800
But that whatever psi is, what does a psi look like?

101
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,480
Does it look like mid?

102
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:43,640
It's in phi.

103
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,400
So it's a phi, so it looks like that.

104
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:50,200
And that's why it looks like an O in Norwegian.

105
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:52,839
But I see a psi.

106
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:53,880
It's the phi.

107
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,079
I've always said psi all my life, the phi phenomenon.

108
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:59,560
And you see that every day.

109
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,799
You realize that you see that every day?

110
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:04,119
You don't have to be in a gestaltist lab to see it.

111
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,000
Just I want to see how much I have to explain.

112
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,200
Somebody tell me, where do you see it every day?

113
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:12,760
You see it less now than in the 50s.

114
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,520
I can look in the board with it.

115
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,800
When I was a kid, it was all over them.

116
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,640
But it's a neon sign.

117
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,080
It seems to fling, something seems to flip back and forth.

118
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:28,920
And you see, you know, something like an arrow going from here to there and going from here to there, but there isn't any arrow in between.

119
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:30,439
There isn't any arrow at all.

120
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:34,039
You turn this one on, and then that one on when you turn this one off.

121
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,959
And when you get the sink right, you see a luminous something going back and forth.

122
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,240
That must still be somewhere.

123
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,799
Although, there the girl with a length.

124
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:45,160
There's a length going up and down.

125
00:11:45,319 --> 00:11:45,799
Where is that?

126
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,000
Las Vegas.

127
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,799
Las Vegas.

128
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:48,200
Okay, good.

129
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,199
You have to go to Las Vegas to see the phi phenomenon now.

130
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:53,480
It was Tara, Indiana.

131
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,960
It was all over the place once upon a time.

132
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:58,440
Okay, well, I'm glad there's still one left.

133
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,840
Anyway, that's the DeStal story he's talking about.

134
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,240
There, but now get rid of the leg.

135
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:21,480
And all you would need is a bright spot, which is what the Gestaltists were studying, which moves back and forth as you turn on and off the whatever, the lights in a black room.

136
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:24,160
You can picture that, even if you haven't seen it.

137
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,359
And it turns out that it's very interesting.

138
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:36,640
The movement goes back and forth, but there's nothing moving and nothing in the middle, and yet you see pure motion.

139
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:42,560
That's what the Gestaltists says, and that's what Miro-Ponty thinks is equally wrong.

140
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:45,039
And just he's so interesting in the way he thinks.

141
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:47,840
I mean, he thinks the objectivist has got something right.

142
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,480
You better be able to see an object moving.

143
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,720
Oh, you're not seeing motion.

144
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:59,520
Even though you're having this phenomenon of something going back and forth, and it looks like motion, he isn't denying that.

145
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,160
That's what the Gestalts have got right.

146
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,360
It doesn't look like an object in motion.

147
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,599
Of course, the Gestaltists never said it did.

148
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,840
But Miro-Ponty is interested in how we perceive objects in motion.

149
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,640
And he thinks the Gestaltists are just as wrong.

150
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:20,160
The objectivist can't explain how he thinks the object is so important that he can't explain the motion.

151
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,080
And that leads you to Zeno.

152
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:28,560
And now the Gestaltist thinks you can see the motion so much that you don't need to bring in the object.

153
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,559
And he's going to say that's wrong.

154
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,720
But here's what he says.

155
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:40,559
I perceive movements without any identical moving object, without any external landmark, and without any relativity.

156
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,880
Relativity means a distinction between what's moving and the background.

157
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,640
It is all as gone.

158
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,600
There's no background either.

159
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,880
There's just this light going back and forth in the dark room.

160
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:58,160
And there isn't any movement really, but there's the phenomenon of movement, which we experience.

161
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,760
We experience well, or maybe we should put it this way: hmm, I wonder if this is in the French or the English.

162
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,120
It occurs to me that the Gestalt people are saying we experience motion.

163
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,559
And these aspects asking about movement.

164
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,120
Is that right?

165
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:15,960
To have movement, you've got to have an object moving, I would think.

166
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:19,239
But motion, you see this bright spot going back and forth.

167
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,880
Is there any distinction like that in French?

168
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,320
Well, there is, isn't there?

169
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:29,400
Because in Botany, you didn't move an object moving right there.

170
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,760
Not according to him.

171
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:33,160
Oh, well, then you get a spot-like thing.

172
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,240
We get the illusion of an object moving.

173
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:39,880
Well, the object being the sort of spot that seems to be going from here to there.

174
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,160
I mean, there's you don't need any.

175
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,320
I mean, it's a funny sort of object.

176
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:45,080
It's an intermittent thing.

177
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,400
It's not as good as you experience.

178
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:53,000
God is going to experience the experience of moving one line and another thing, which is moving.

179
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Well, I think that's what the next page is supposed to argue against.

180
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:23,160
And you're supposed to say, if it was intervening, if it went through the intervening space, if something went through the intervening space, it would in this little picture, if you had these two lines, like the leg of the girl, flipping up and down, I mean, let's just call neon with every neon sign lights in a dark room, you would think that it would pass through completing this thing in the middle.

181
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,559
And apparently the phenomena is that there it doesn't do that.

182
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,959
So it's it's pure passage.

183
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,679
And maybe that's wrong, but I think that's what he's arguing.

184
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:34,519
Let me see if I can find the line.

185
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:36,039
Top of 314.

186
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,960
The perception of positions varies inversely, I would say inversely to, I think, the translator.

187
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:45,400
Inversely to that of movement.

188
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:52,039
It is even possible to show that movement is never the successive occurrence by a moving body of every position between the two extremes.

189
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:58,479
So it's a very peculiar thing that moves because it doesn't move through the space in between.

190
00:15:58,479 --> 00:16:04,080
If you think there's evidence of that, so there's not much left for a moving object.

191
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:11,679
And I think he thinks, and I don't know the Ferrimer stuff, that the Gestalt people have just gotten rid of the moving object.

192
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:13,439
Let's see if I can.

193
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,519
Without an identical moving object, we see movements.

194
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,239
I would have said, I wonder, I'm going to go back and look later, but I want to say now motion.

195
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:22,640
What?

196
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,679
I didn't bring a pen?

197
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:24,880
That surprises me.

198
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,720
Oh, here's what I'm going to do.

199
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,039
I wonder if there are two words.

200
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,880
Well, that's what Olivia means.

201
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,799
Olivia is finishing writing a book.

202
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,640
He has to get it in by the end of the week, so he's not going to be here.

203
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,160
Yeah, that's the.

204
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,640
Okay, now what do you say online about motion?

205
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,080
The position is produced by having these two dots turning on and off.

206
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,160
There are a template between them.

207
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,560
Yeah.

208
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,880
But what you proceed is one dot.

209
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,120
Well, one dot.

210
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:54,959
Okay, but say.

211
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:07,600
Yes, you see it as if it was going through the intervening positions, and yet you don't see these stars as passing through a stage in which they produce the middle bar.

212
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,040
I don't want to get involved in it.

213
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:21,919
I mean, he's got some things from Wertheimer which make it seem that if the Daltons have evidence, then you'd be even less than what Alva says you see.

214
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,959
And I have no opinion, and I don't think we have to make up our mind about this.

215
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,079
One bot is threatened, one body's trending.

216
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:29,359
Oh, yeah, don't agree with that.

217
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,479
I was going to ignore that.

218
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:32,640
That's the Dennett phenomenon.

219
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,479
And I don't see that.

220
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:39,279
I thought about that, Alva, and I didn't see that it was going to help with this or hurt this either.

221
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:41,640
So let's put it aside for the time being.

222
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:48,360
If we get time, we can go back to a very peculiar phenomenon that's been discussed a lot in the literature.

223
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,039
Let's see now.

224
00:17:51,320 --> 00:18:01,560
Okay, so Meryl-Ponty wants us to understand how we experience an object in motion, which I'm going to call movement, if I find other ones.

225
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,239
And that's what he's setting out to do.

226
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:10,040
And now we've gotten, we're already on page 314 and 315.

227
00:18:10,999 --> 00:18:22,360
And the intellectualist now, I'm just running through the argument, and answers the Gestaltist who says in his extremist form, well, there's no object moving.

228
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,919
Well, that's ridiculous, the intellectualist says.

229
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:37,560
If I didn't see an object moving, it wouldn't be movement because if something just was over here and then popped up over here, you wouldn't count it as movement.

230
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:44,280
There's got to be an object, and it's got to go through the intervening space, says the intellectualist or the objectivist.

231
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,959
Really, more like an intellectualist.

232
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:53,160
He becomes an intellectualist at this point because he says, well, even if you don't see a moving object, you at least have to think one.

233
00:18:53,479 --> 00:19:05,160
That's what he says on about halfway down the bottom paragraph on 315.

234
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:15,640
Even though the psychologist, that's always the Gestalt psychologist, at least in this spectrum, may show that stroboscopic motion is produced without any intermediate stimulus between the extreme positions.

235
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:21,479
And even that a luminous line A doesn't travel through the space separated from B.

236
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,160
See, that's what he thinks.

237
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,559
That no line is perceived between A and B during stroboscopic motion.

238
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:30,319
In fact, I do not see the pencil and so forth and so forth.

239
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:39,199
So there still has to be a moving body between the points for movement to be apparent.

240
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:47,600
And if it's not perceptively present, it is thought of as rare.

241
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:56,640
Now, maybe, I'm not, we shouldn't go into it here, but maybe what Alva's showing is you can't help thinking about it as if there is a dot moving.

242
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:06,959
And Bernheim is trying to prove with some kind of experiments that you never actually see a dot moving by telling you things like you don't see it completing things in the middle.

243
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:08,880
And I don't know.

244
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,279
So he thinks, yes, makes sense of motion.

245
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,359
You've got to at least think that there's something moving.

246
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,120
But of course, he's not for that.

247
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:34,559
So then comes another interesting move that the Gestaltists say we have to perform, not think the movements of an object, but perform a perceptual synthesis.

248
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,400
This is on 317.

249
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,840
Wait a minute now.

250
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:41,919
I've got to tell you again where it's not Merrill-Ponty.

251
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:56,880
Okay, on page 316, it's been Merrow-Ponty explaining the phi phenomenon until about eight lines from the bottom.

252
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,199
No, no, sorry.

253
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:01,599
All that explaining is Merrow-Ponty.

254
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,719
That's the Gestaltist.

255
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:07,919
And that ends where he says identity of the object in motion.

256
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:14,999
Now it goes back to Mero-Ponty explaining, well, I don't know.

257
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:18,519
It's when Mero-Ponty is explaining the Gestaltists.

258
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:21,479
He's so close to them that he's not agreeing with them.

259
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:27,640
I don't know why he wrote not Merillop-Ponty, but he explains the psych phenomena.

260
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,359
But let's go on.

261
00:21:28,439 --> 00:21:30,919
I'll try to see if I understand why I said that.

262
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:41,319
Movement, and the Gestalt psychologist replies, is one of those psychic phenomena which, like given sense, contains such a color and form are related and so forth.

263
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,039
Now, he's still explaining.

264
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,600
I guess I want to say it's neither Merillo-Ponty nor not Merillo-Ponty.

265
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:54,040
It's Mero-Ponty telling you, frankly, this is what the Gestaltsists think.

266
00:21:54,279 --> 00:22:00,120
When it's really hard to understand, it's when Merillo-Ponty is giving you a view and he looks like it's his view.

267
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:08,600
And since he's usually on the side of the Gestaltist, more or less, you confuse me because, but it's just what it is.

268
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,840
It's Merlot-Ponty frankly telling you this is what the Gestaltists think.

269
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:19,400
And he's doing that on 317, the top, but we are not concerned with this.

270
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,679
And, oh, there's just a funny typo that I can correct.

271
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:24,359
I'm getting annoyed at these types.

272
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:31,479
The top is 317, but we are not concerned with this, and there is no question of trying to reduce movement to a state of rest.

273
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:33,880
I'm interested in that because that's a new mistake.

274
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,919
I'm collecting mistakes in mistranslation, which they've added to the preview.

275
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:44,759
Now, let's go to the issue, the issues, the middle of the page.

276
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,959
The Gestaltists talk about dynamic phenomena.

277
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:55,040
And that gets them into a question of the synthesis.

278
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,079
I guess that's just what tied up with dynamics.

279
00:22:53,880 --> 00:23:00,080
He doesn't explain why it has to be a synthesis.

280
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:06,719
Dynamic phenomena take their unity from me, who live through them and who affect their synthesis.

281
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:10,239
Now, it is important to realize that's not Merloponte's view.

282
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,040
He's still explaining the Gestalt's view.

283
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:17,679
So you could say it's not Merloponte, except he's frankly explaining the Gestalt theory.

284
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,079
So you don't have to be puzzled.

285
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:38,400
Then he says, thus we pass from an idea of movement, which is destructive of it, to an experience of movement, which I would like to say motion, which tries to provide it with a basis, and also from this experience to an idea without which, strictly speaking, the experience is meaningless.

286
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,439
So then he sort of puts it all together.

287
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:52,400
We cannot then regard either the psychologist, Gestalt people, or the logician, the objectivist, as vindicated, or rather both must be vindicated.

288
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:58,719
And we have to find a means of reconciling the thesis and antithesis as both true.

289
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,600
So this is the dialectic so far.

290
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:04,160
Let me just tell the object.

291
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,959
I just wrote it to myself, so I'll read it to you.

292
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:11,919
The objectivist says, movement has changed your place of a determinate object.

293
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:15,360
Gestaltist replies, we can see pure motion.

294
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,199
You don't need a determinate object.

295
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:21,199
The intellectualist says, well, you at least have to think that there's an object.

296
00:24:21,199 --> 00:24:28,320
And the Gestaltist says, well, not exactly, but we do have to perform a perceptual synthesis, whatever that is.

297
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:38,479
And then Merloponte, having gone through all that, puts in, somewhat confusingly, but interesting.

298
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:44,360
He switches to the question of synthesis, 3AT, and he starts attacking the idea of synthesis.

299
00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:49,479
I mean, how the Gestaltist got saddled with the idea of synthesis, I don't know.

300
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:51,880
What he's really talking about is Husserl.

301
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:58,839
And he starts criticizing Husserl as the logician on the middle of 3AT.

302
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,280
And what he says is extremely interesting about Hutton.

303
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,839
And I never understood it till this morning, so I'm feeling very pleased with myself.

304
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:08,200
I don't know how long that will last.

305
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:39,959
Okay, so starting in the middle of the page, the logician says, if we take E, the logician, say, different appearances of movement at different points on its course, they will be appearances of one and the same movement, only if they are appearances of one and the same object in motion, of one and the same air shining depth, of one and the same, that is, appearance, of one and the same something which presents itself through them all.

306
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:50,999
Now, keep in mind, and this is what I thought this morning, which maybe helped me understand this, the old story about perceiving a house.

307
00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:57,799
And the question, I put the phenomenon out right now, and so you can bear in mind right now what the issue is.

308
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:02,279
There are two ways of thinking about perceiving a unified house.

309
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:04,600
This is constantly coming up.

310
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:20,999
So you could think that what you basically see are aspects, or in viteral language, obstruction, perspective views of the house, like the front, the side, the back.

311
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:29,839
And then you synthesize them with some rule that a house has them, and a rule that tells you what order they will come by, you should go around and so forth.

312
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:31,280
This goes back to time.

313
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:37,999
And you end up with what, or you should begin to have a feel for what Merofonte's answer to that is.

314
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:40,160
No, no, you don't do that, he would say.

315
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:49,839
You always first basically see the whole house, and you only see these perspectives as perspective views of the object.

316
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,239
So they don't need to be synthesized.

317
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:59,200
They're given to you as always already together as aspectual views.

318
00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:05,439
They're given to you perceptually as already aspectual views of a single object.

319
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:09,200
And this is what he's now going to object and talk about.

320
00:27:09,199 --> 00:27:15,599
He says, but the moving object, you see where we are, two-thirds down, 318.

321
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:22,239
But, this is Mero-Ponte now answering the Hussarian or the logician or whatever.

322
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:35,199
But the moving object needs to be posited as being a part only if its appearances at different points have themselves been brought into being as discrete perspectives.

323
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:44,880
That is, determinate perspectives as the object goes by, or determinate perspectival views of the house.

324
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,640
If you think that's what you're dealing with, then you've got to question, how do you synthesize it?

325
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,679
So let's go.

326
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:59,520
The logician knows on principle that only positing consciousness, sorry, knows in principle, only positive consciousness.

327
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:05,519
And it is this postulate, this supposition of a wholly determinate world, that that should remind you of Sean.

328
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:18,839
And Sean's basic insight is whenever determined each other's updates, you know, something's gone wrong, because for Merlot-Ponty, perception is just indeterminate in lots and lots of different ways, and it's not determinate in any way.

329
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:27,559
So the decent people, whoever they are, think that there is something wholly determined.

330
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,039
And then he calls that pure being.

331
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:37,400
That the devil is, the logician's conception of multiplicity and consequently of synthesis.

332
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,439
You see why?

333
00:28:38,439 --> 00:28:44,519
It makes him believe that synthesis is adding up determinate perspective views.

334
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:48,999
Now, you have pointed out sometimes that Merlot-Ponty uses the word synthesis.

335
00:28:48,999 --> 00:28:50,360
Yes, he does.

336
00:28:50,360 --> 00:29:06,360
He uses it to describe the always already organized perceptual object, but it's not an mental activity as it is if you think that there are these determinate perspective views that have to be added up.

337
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,800
There's an amazing footnote.

338
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,640
I'll just jump ahead through it.

339
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:23,479
Where just at the bottom of 322, after an incredibly long and incomprehensible, to me anyway, footnote about Bergson, but we don't know Bergson, so just don't worry about the footnote.

340
00:29:23,479 --> 00:29:26,360
But in the end, he says something which I didn't want him to say.

341
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:32,360
In fact, I said to somebody in office hours that Kant has a distinction between synopsis and synthesis.

342
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:40,679
Synopsis is when you get the whole first, and synthesis is when you've got the elements first and you have to put them together according to a rule in Kant.

343
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:51,880
So here he says, let us say at the bottom of 322, let us say for a moment that we prefer to the notion of synthesis, that is synopsis, which does not yet point to an explicit positing of diversity.

344
00:29:51,880 --> 00:30:10,160
And every time he saw a synthesis and Merilo Fontin was saying it, you wrote synopsis, and every time you saw a synthesis and Marilyn Fontaine was criticizing the intellectualist and I think personal, you would try, and Kant, I've got a new phrase after the talk I gave.

345
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:12,640
People who believe in the myth of the mental.

346
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:18,319
There's always talk about the myth of the given if you follow in other courses maybe.

347
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:26,239
The myth of the mental is that you've got these determinate elements and the mind has to contribute something to get them together.

348
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,160
And that's what you want to get rid of, according to Merlot Fontini.

349
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:31,439
So let's go on.

350
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:37,919
The moving object, or other, as we call it, the mobile entity, is not identical beneath the phases of movement.

351
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,599
It is identical in them.

352
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,599
That's the crucial sense.

353
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:42,880
You understand that?

354
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,400
You've got to keep the house in mind.

355
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,039
And that's why I've never understood this passage before.

356
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:52,239
That is, there are two possibilities that take us thought with the house.

357
00:30:52,239 --> 00:31:13,360
So you can have some intellectual unit, a rule of gunfilm, that holds together the determinate phases of the house as you go over the bit of you, or the momentary positions of the object as it moves.

358
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,079
You've got these thematized determinate something or others, elements, let's call them.

359
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:28,320
And beneath that, or behind that, or putting that together is what he calls the beneath the movement.

360
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,999
Now, what does it say?

361
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:31,039
It's not beneath the movement.

362
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,320
It's identical in them.

363
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,239
Well, again, the house story works.

364
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:38,400
It's the experience of the whole house, the synopsis.

365
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:47,160
The given house with all of its parts already there and present, though not completely determined, of course, and particularly not the backstage, but all there.

366
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:55,239
That is the unity that is the house, that is the experience of the house, and that's what he's contrasting with.

367
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:57,640
That's what he says it's identical in them.

368
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:02,839
That unity is prior to any intellectuals taking apart the elements.

369
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:03,880
Look, you want to say something?

370
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,959
Is your knowledge already there?

371
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:07,960
It's strong, ontological framework.

372
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:09,080
What did I?

373
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,200
Oh, what's already there?

374
00:32:10,199 --> 00:32:11,160
Oh, the unity.

375
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,320
That's a phenomenological claim.

376
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:24,600
That when you're experiencing a house, the experience is of the house as already unified and already present in its various indeterminate aspects.

377
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:25,960
Here we go.

378
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,799
What are the other alternatives?

379
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:29,799
What were the two annihilators?

380
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,080
Oh, that's not ontological, it's not epistemological.

381
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,199
Those are the other two?

382
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:35,079
That's right.

383
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:40,359
It's not about the house as it is the being of the house, because then you'll get it.

384
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:45,160
Whenever you think about being, you get an answer that's determinate the way he's using being.

385
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,399
So it can't be about the being of the house.

386
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:54,920
The being is what you get after the crypto mechanism has turned everything into sort of crystallized everything into determinacy.

387
00:32:55,319 --> 00:33:00,760
And epistemologically, no, it's not got to do with what you know about.

388
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:02,840
But it could all turn out to be wrong.

389
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:13,640
We jumped to the end of the lecture, where you might just go around the back and define something out that hasn't got a back, it's just got a backyard and some potholes enough with the sod.

390
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:20,359
That doesn't mean, epistemologically, that means that you didn't know it was a house.

391
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:21,880
But that's not the question.

392
00:33:21,879 --> 00:33:25,919
The phenomenological question is: did you see it as a whole house with a back or not?

393
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:31,279
And the answer is yes, you saw it as a whole house with an indeterminate but present hidden back.

394
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,399
So it's not epistemological, I think, and not ontological.

395
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,439
Why is that indeterminate?

396
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,359
Oh, well, because you don't know enough about it.

397
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:40,479
I mean, it needn't be.

398
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:58,160
I've just been repeating it to say, I mean, it's going to come up to the importance that indeterminate can range a lot from every aspect of the house is indeterminate, and that you can find out more and more about it by zooming in on it and making it more and more figured there upon two things.

399
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,479
But some of it's more indeterminate than others.

400
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:09,679
And I'm assuming now that you're concerning a house, which you have every reason to believe is a house, although that's too intellectual, that you're just set to see a house and there one is.

401
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,400
And now you're set to see a house and there it is, but you've never gone around it.

402
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,120
Well, the back is pretty indeterminate.

403
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:21,600
Jumping ahead of something because I understood a lot of things this morning I never understood before.

404
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:29,039
He's going to say in a minute that there's something, what remains he's saying in the movement is the style of movement.

405
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,679
What in the world could that mean?

406
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,479
I think that's coming up very soon on 319.

407
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:40,000
Why don't we wait for a second till we get to 319 and I will explain it in terms of a house.

408
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,560
Four houses are very important.

409
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,319
Now let's see.

410
00:34:44,319 --> 00:34:45,120
Wherein I go.

411
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,199
Every sentence here is interesting.

412
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:52,319
It is not because I find the same stone on the ground that I believe in its identity throughout its movement.

413
00:34:52,319 --> 00:34:55,679
Remember you threw a stone in the garden early on in the chapter.

414
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:06,080
It is, on the contrary, because I perceive it as identical during that movement with an implicit identity that remains to be described, that I go to pick it up and recover it.

415
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:10,439
We shall not try, we shall not find in the Stonian movement everything we know.

416
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,040
Well, that's all we need there.

417
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:17,400
Well, what is it that stays the same when you throw the stone?

418
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:21,560
And through the movement, you certainly can't get a very good picture of it.

419
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,719
It's just a kind of blur.

420
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:29,160
But he says, mysteriously, I think, he pulls a pen out of the bag.

421
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:38,040
I mean, he's got the intellectualist and ontologist and logician who says, well, that remains the same as how a rock fail when you throw a rock.

422
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:43,319
And he's got the other people, the Gestalt people, who say, no, nothing needs to remain the same.

423
00:35:43,319 --> 00:35:47,160
There's just can be such a thing as pure emotion, and that's what you see.

424
00:35:47,399 --> 00:35:49,319
And he says, neither can be right.

425
00:35:49,319 --> 00:35:53,640
There's got to be something there that moves, or what Alva said in the beginning.

426
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:58,360
And it's got to, and it can't be a completely determinate rock.

427
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:02,759
We're talking about perception now, not the epistemology or ontology.

428
00:36:02,759 --> 00:36:05,719
It doesn't look like a completely determinate rock.

429
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:07,560
So what do you see?

430
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:13,319
Well, oddly enough, you see a style going by, about 18 lines down.

431
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:16,279
The moving object as an on 319.

432
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:24,439
The moving object as object of an indefinite series of explicit and concordant perceptions has property.

433
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:28,359
The moving object has objects, indefinite properties.

434
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,799
Oh, yeah, that's what that's wrong.

435
00:36:30,279 --> 00:36:33,479
Yeah, I'm getting this dyslexical surprising.

436
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,479
Yeah, that's not what he's talking about.

437
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,480
The mobile entity has only a style.

438
00:36:39,799 --> 00:36:44,759
What is impossible is that the perceived and never mind, the circle, that's just another example.

439
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,199
What does that mean?

440
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,759
Well, I started listing what that what what a style might be.

441
00:36:50,759 --> 00:36:59,039
I said, well, maybe like fast or slow or blurred or awkward or floppy or zigzag.

442
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:01,279
I didn't know what really belonged on that list.

443
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,039
But finally, he gives you an example at the top of 321.

444
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,679
What is the style of a bird flying?

445
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:11,920
Well, six lines down, it's a flurry of cummage.

446
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:15,439
So the style is flurried, apparently.

447
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,639
So I wasn't far off when I got to awkward and floppy and maybe zigzagged.

448
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,120
But the question would be, how do you put that back in terms of a house?

449
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,239
Well, you haven't seen the back yet, but you know already, no, it's not.

450
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:38,000
You perceive already the style of the house, and you know that the back, you perceive that the back, is going to have a certain style.

451
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,640
That means you're looking at a Georgian house from the front or a colonial house from the front or a Maybeck house from the front.

452
00:37:44,640 --> 00:38:02,639
You don't know how many windows it's got on the back, what color it's been painted on the back, but you do see that it's going to, you see the hidden back as not only as present with no characteristics, you see it as present with a Georgian style or a Maybeck style.

453
00:38:02,799 --> 00:38:04,320
That's what he's up to.

454
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:06,560
And it works for houses.

455
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,679
I guess it works for birds flying fluffy pumblichly by.

456
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:12,880
I don't know.

457
00:38:12,879 --> 00:38:14,960
But that's what he's trying to do.

458
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,000
So let's see him.

459
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,400
So it's not an object defined in terms of collection of properties.

460
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:23,920
It's got to be something that moves on two-thirds down.

461
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,719
Or at most something colored or luminous without any actual color.

462
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:34,719
I mean, some that he's being very general, that he wants something in there that moves.

463
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:39,479
And I guess maybe, Alvis, he's saying that he thinks Wernheimer is just wrong.

464
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,080
That maybe, you know, that the truth is there is always something that moves.

465
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,399
He was explaining Wernheimer's view before.

466
00:38:45,879 --> 00:38:48,279
His view is: yes, there's an object.

467
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,280
If you see movement, you don't just see motion.

468
00:38:52,279 --> 00:39:00,520
You see an object that moves, but it's a very peculiar thing because it's an object without any determinate characteristics.

469
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,719
It's an object with just a style.

470
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:11,400
It's just a way of moving, sort of adverbially, fluffily or awkwardly or flappily or whatever.

471
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:13,880
That's the story.

472
00:39:13,879 --> 00:39:15,479
Now let's see.

473
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:20,040
Those pictures are no more.

474
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:21,239
No, that's right.

475
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:22,519
You're just one step ahead.

476
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,879
They're just as not present as the back.

477
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:27,079
I was going to get to that.

478
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,879
We haven't finished.

479
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:29,719
Let me come back to that.

480
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,160
I think that's the right thing to say next, which I just want to catch up.

481
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,600
Normally, if you throw a stone, where are we on?

482
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,399
319.

483
00:39:37,399 --> 00:39:41,080
Okay, normally if we throw a stone, we don't see a determinate object.

484
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:44,119
And we see more than a moving blur.

485
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,120
We see a blur with a style.

486
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,120
And then I say the house thing.

487
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,919
And then this is just where Albert said it.

488
00:39:50,920 --> 00:40:00,679
And then it's as if, unlike the house, which is more determinate from the front, I'm assuming again that you're looking at the front and you've never seen the back.

489
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:03,559
So the front's a lot more determinate than the back.

490
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,360
A moving object is back all over.

491
00:40:07,399 --> 00:40:08,919
That's just what you intuitive.

492
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,559
And that's just what he says on 310 with a variant that they move the name.

493
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,440
It's that it's as indeterminate as you can get.

494
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:23,240
So as the back of, say, a May-Bac house is as indeterminate as you can get as long as it's a May-Bac house.

495
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:28,399
So only the style is left on as far as the back is concerned.

496
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:39,360
So in movement, it's as if all you ever saw was the way the movement is perceived is the way the back, the unfamiliar back of the house is perceived.

497
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,319
And that's what he seems to be saying on.

498
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:47,919
I sort of guessed that, and I was so amazed and pleased to find it in the footnote.

499
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,439
He doesn't make anything of it.

500
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,120
But once you're playing a house game, you might as well make something of it.

501
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,240
About six lines down on 320.

502
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:06,800
He talks about how the way the object is seen is that is only as the back of objects or the face behind you is seen.

503
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:13,919
That's exactly the minimal amount of determinativeness that you could have, but you got something.

504
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:20,479
Whenever he says early on and says it every once in a while, it isn't as if there's just a chasm behind you or a blank space behind you.

505
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:26,399
There's already a room and floor and stuff, but in a very indeterminate way.

506
00:41:26,399 --> 00:41:30,239
And if I was, you know, the more unfamiliar the room, the more indeterminate.

507
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:34,640
For me, already it's blackboard and screen that I didn't remember.

508
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,319
Okay, so let's see now.

509
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:39,040
So it's all it's back.

510
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,679
Movement is back all over.

511
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:44,000
Now let's see what we get from there.

512
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:45,919
Well, that's the end of that point.

513
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,279
I mean, now he's made his point against the that's the dialectic.

514
00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:55,999
He's got the two wrong views, and he's got his answer, and it's neat.

515
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,120
And it draws on the house phenomenon.

516
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,399
Phenomenon, what?

517
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:06,079
It's a phenomenon and the phenomenon to say is the fact.

518
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:07,120
A fact.

519
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:08,120
What is the always.

520
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,919
The always-there unity of the house is a phenomenon.

521
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,039
It's not a fact for the following reason.

522
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,679
I mean, it's the always-there unity of the perceptual house.

523
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:23,239
And it's what I said about the epistemology thing.

524
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:30,919
The always-there unity of the perceptual house doesn't mean that, in fact, there's a unified house there, because it could turn out to be go wrong.

525
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,119
Go around it.

526
00:42:32,359 --> 00:42:46,440
But the perception from the front of a facade that you're set to view as a house is just got the same amount of determinacy and indeterminacy in it as your perception of a real house.

527
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:51,640
It's not an epistemological point that one of them lacks something, the other one's got.

528
00:42:52,279 --> 00:43:01,080
Now, when we get to the illusion part, which we may well get to today, that's, I have to qualify that story, but not take it back.

529
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:09,000
There's always the whole future taken for granted in what you see.

530
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:19,640
And the question of whether that's reliable or not is not the phenomenologist question.

531
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:25,800
It has to be the epistemologist question, what evidence you have to trust that, and what evidence goes against that.

532
00:43:25,799 --> 00:43:26,199
Yeah.

533
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,399
Focusing on other things, or is it foreground up?

534
00:43:35,399 --> 00:43:38,120
The rough and background and foreground.

535
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,640
Whoa, you're on to the next one.

536
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,280
Everybody is so, that's the next issue.

537
00:43:42,279 --> 00:43:44,840
The next issue is foreground and background.

538
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:47,160
And I just wrote here, I didn't like your question.

539
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,439
How can we tell what is background and what is moving?

540
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,719
That's the question, right?

541
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:55,080
Or how do we make that just how do we sort that out phenomenologically?

542
00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:00,080
If that's your question, and I'm not putting words in your mouth, that's the next question.

543
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:06,400
And that gets us back to the train and playing cards in the train, but I have to get us where we are.

544
00:44:06,879 --> 00:44:08,080
Let's see.

545
00:44:08,399 --> 00:44:10,160
Well, let me, I'm on 320.

546
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,999
I'm not quite ready to go to that yet.

547
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,880
Almost.

548
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,400
I'm always hammering on this notion of synthesis.

549
00:44:16,399 --> 00:44:25,359
But I think that's, I wish Olivier were here because he defends the view that this is like literal, and I'm always trying to find evidence that it's not.

550
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,759
This is a very important paragraph for me.

551
00:44:27,759 --> 00:44:29,520
I have to say something about it.

552
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,760
It's so painfully connected with my own biography.

553
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,160
So let's look at the last sentence.

554
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:40,799
He talks about he wants to reject the Kantian notion of synthesis.

555
00:44:40,799 --> 00:44:45,120
I bet it begins, but it amounts to introducing non-fetish consciousness into the perception of movement.

556
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:53,520
That is, as we've shown, it amounts to rejecting not only the a priori essential necessity, never mind that, but the Kantian notion of synthesis.

557
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,559
We've gone through that.

558
00:44:54,560 --> 00:45:02,800
The Kantian notion of synthesis is there are elements and then you have to bring in something mental to fix it.

559
00:45:02,799 --> 00:45:05,199
And then he's skipping over the, well, I have to read it.

560
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:10,240
Link's work belongs to and is typical of the second period of Husserl's phenomenology.

561
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:25,759
That is, he's saying Link, whoever he is, has rejected synthesis, like the second period of Husserl's phenomenology, which marks a transition from the eidetic method of Nevermind or Lotusism and so on, to the existentialism of the last period.

562
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,320
Think you're all going to read that sentence.

563
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,880
I have to say something about it.

564
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:36,400
And Olivier may wait, well I'll tell him what I said, and he may want to say something about it.

565
00:45:36,399 --> 00:45:54,600
I mean, what I think is that that's just false, that there is a view of Husserl which says, yes, in ideas, in early Husserl, it's like Kant, but in the end, Husserl introduces the notion of passive synthesis, and then he becomes like Meryl-Ponty.

566
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:58,520
And I wrote my PhD thesis on that sentence.

567
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:06,840
I believed Meryl-Ponty that there was an existentialism in the last period, and I read all later Husserl stuff, and I looked for it.

568
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:17,400
And finally, I never found it, but I made up things to support it because I believe that it must be there, and I'm just missing it.

569
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:39,560
But I now think, no, there's no, there's never, if existentialism means what I said at the beginning of the hour, that you have to be engaged and moving toward in a body, moving toward an optimal grip on the world, and that that's the bottom line and explains all the phenomena, then Husserl never had it.

570
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:53,399
And it's just misleading to talk about the existentialism of the last period and make why Meryl-Ponty wants to make himself less original and read it back into Husserl is a subject for intellectual history.

571
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:56,600
I have speculations, but they're not relevant.

572
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,560
But you shouldn't just believe it.

573
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:18,760
And that means you should think that even, even if Husserl had something which he, and even if passive synthesis was some non-mentalist way of unifying perspectives, Husserl never got beyond the idea of perspectives, I think.

574
00:47:18,759 --> 00:47:24,679
But even if he got beyond the idea of perspectives, he never got the crucial phrase.

575
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:31,599
That's why I was emphasizing in fact here, where he talks about existential dimensions.

576
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,640
Husserl doesn't have existential dimensions.

577
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:44,560
That is, he doesn't have us involved in the world, moving to get a grip as a necessary condition for there being any objects with any properties at all.

578
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,560
At least if he does, I don't know it.

579
00:47:47,759 --> 00:47:49,679
We'll talk about that later if you're disagreeing.

580
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:51,839
Are you disagreeing and holding it from your mouse?

581
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,039
I think it's a difficult question.

582
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,080
It's a difficult question.

583
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,119
Well, I believe that.

584
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:01,600
It cost me my PhD in the sense that I got my degree, but I never published my thesis, but I decided it was wrong.

585
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,560
Yeah.

586
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:17,679
I have people also put this for the discussion, but my studies doing everything against what he just said, but actually these are still the onto my stuff that we believe that we have to be reading it out of you know this was your business.

587
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:20,479
It's gotten the benefits of God.

588
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,799
It's not about the other body movement, anyway.

589
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:27,519
But I still think the potential evidence for oh well, that's amazing.

590
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:27,919
Okay.

591
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:36,479
Well it it it could be that Sean and I are one step beyond Merlot Fonte and and have something that isn't a big part of this book that I'm going to complain.

592
00:48:36,799 --> 00:48:41,759
I'm I'm going to treat Meryl Fontea like he treats Husserl and read my views back into him.

593
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:42,479
Yeah.

594
00:48:42,799 --> 00:48:48,559
It seems like some people would would say that something is dangerous with existentialism is the notion of being in the world.

595
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:48,879
Yes.

596
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,919
That maximum grip kind of lashes onto being in the world.

597
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,400
Yes.

598
00:48:52,399 --> 00:49:02,400
And that if if that is the hallmark of existentialism and it seems that if Husserl doesn't have being in the world, then that is that would be the decisive.

599
00:49:02,399 --> 00:49:10,600
And that would tie, we don't want to go more into Husserl, but that would tie up with what he thinks the phenomenological reduction is and whether he ever gives it up.

600
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,120
Because and that's a difficult question.

601
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:16,999
Okay, but now we're off to her question.

602
00:49:17,239 --> 00:49:19,239
I just had to catch up with it.

603
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,840
I want to make sure that I up to it.

604
00:49:22,839 --> 00:49:24,359
Okay, now we've got a notion.

605
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:27,640
And this I now remember I said toward the end I understand less and less.

606
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,800
Up to now I was happy that I understood something and ready to lay it out.

607
00:49:31,799 --> 00:49:35,479
But more and more it gets to be hard to understand for me.

608
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:42,040
So we want to know how we can tell what is the background and what's moving.

609
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:45,399
Or how we make the separation might be better instead of how we can tell.

610
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:48,999
That sounds the wrong way to look at the large ball.

611
00:49:50,759 --> 00:49:51,800
There it is.

612
00:49:51,799 --> 00:49:52,440
Okay.

613
00:49:53,239 --> 00:50:01,800
How we distinguish, how we distinguish what is background and what is doing the moving.

614
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:17,399
Well then comes the thing we discussed long ago, but we have to go over it again, about whether you're in a train, when you're in a train and there's some other train next to you, remember, and the question, and either train starts to move, it doesn't matter.

615
00:50:17,399 --> 00:50:18,839
One of the trains moves.

616
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:27,719
And then I sense as fixed whatever train I'm involved in.

617
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:36,280
If I'm leading in my train, then if my train starts to move, I experience the train next to me as moving.

618
00:50:36,279 --> 00:50:45,479
If I'm fixed in paying attention to something in the other in the train next to mine, and my train starts to move, I experience my train that's moving.

619
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,479
And you could do variations with the other train moving.

620
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,120
It doesn't matter.

621
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:53,719
The point is that you anchor in something, as he puts it.

622
00:50:53,719 --> 00:50:56,080
It is the background.

623
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,639
And then, relative to that, you can recognize movement.

624
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,199
And let me see now.

625
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:08,640
And now, what makes you see it that way?

626
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,319
But I want to make sure I've got up to that.

627
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,879
Well, I'm on a 323 just to say where I am about 50 miles down.

628
00:51:16,879 --> 00:51:20,160
The fact remains that every object in motion is given in a field.

629
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,480
Just as we need a mobile entity in movement, that's what we've been doing up to now.

630
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,080
We need a basis for movement.

631
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,999
That's what her question got us to.

632
00:51:28,879 --> 00:51:34,719
And then it isn't enough to say that it depends on how it is relative to the edges of the visual field.

633
00:51:34,879 --> 00:51:37,920
I don't know whether Gibson says something like that.

634
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,559
He doesn't want to say that.

635
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:54,800
He has a more existentialist view, namely, where you're involved is what is stationary, and what's peripheral or background will be what is.

636
00:51:54,799 --> 00:51:58,960
Wait a minute, where you're involved, see, I've lost already.

637
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,840
Which is the figure and which is the ground?

638
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:10,400
And where I'm involved in reading this book, that's the background, I guess.

639
00:52:10,399 --> 00:52:14,560
And whatever, no?

640
00:52:14,879 --> 00:52:15,759
I don't know.

641
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,759
Hell, Rick, do you know?

642
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:28,800
I mean, what's, I mean, how does he sort out the fact that there's a separation between where I am and what I'm paying attention to?

643
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:34,960
Because there's this, I guess it's the background is what I'm not paying attention to, but taking for granted.

644
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,600
And that's what I'm going to count as fixed, right?

645
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,759
And what I'm paying attention to is what I'm going to count as moving.

646
00:52:40,759 --> 00:52:41,639
Yeah, okay.

647
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:45,160
I panicked for a minute, but that's not so hard.

648
00:52:45,799 --> 00:52:48,280
And this is the bottom of 323.

649
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:56,120
Accordingly, as we give to a certain part of the field the value of figure or background, it appears to us to be moving or at rest.

650
00:52:56,359 --> 00:52:57,719
And even they're in parallel.

651
00:52:57,719 --> 00:53:00,760
Figure is the one that's moving, background is the one at rest.

652
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:12,839
Then he does it with a ship, and he talks about, and then he talks about something very mysterious on the next page, but I think we should wait till we get there.

653
00:53:14,359 --> 00:53:21,080
So when I see an object, so the next question is: what makes me see it that way?

654
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:33,960
When I see a moving object, then I'm anchored in one frame of reference, that's the background, as non-moving, and then I see whatever I'm looking at as moving.

655
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:42,120
And I think there's something more going on here, which I'm having trouble understanding the question to which it's an answer.

656
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:52,520
But I think it's something like: but when there are two frames of reference, why do I anchor in one rather than the other?

657
00:53:52,520 --> 00:54:04,760
And that I think just depends on my interest, like whether I'm interested in this train or that train, or paying attention to the water under the bridge, or paying attention to the tower, to take another example, and so forth.

658
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,360
That's okay.

659
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:17,879
But then comes the question: something like: what is it that about the moving one that leads me to see it as moving?

660
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:36,560
And it looks to me like he's not just saying that it's because it's a blur, but he says this mysterious, interesting thing on 324 with all, we've got the clouds and the river and all that and the bridge, but he gives you all these examples of how you switch your attention.

661
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:40,320
And when you switch your attention, one thing moves or the other.

662
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:44,319
But now comes this next mysterious question, which is what I'm trying to answer.

663
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:49,600
What makes part of the field count as an object in motion and the other as background?

664
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,520
That seems to be a new question.

665
00:54:51,520 --> 00:55:01,759
I mean, you could say, well, it's where I put my attention that decides which counts as object in motion and background.

666
00:55:01,759 --> 00:55:10,880
But he wants to know what's the phenomenon that makes one part count as motion and the other as background.

667
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,559
How do they look different?

668
00:55:12,879 --> 00:55:18,160
Not which is which, which is the question of how I focus my attention.

669
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:30,080
But when I do focus my attention and I see one of them is moving, how does that relate to this bigger ground business of where I'm anchored and where I'm paying attention?

670
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,120
They're all looking puzzled.

671
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,039
Well, it is puzzling, but maybe it'll get clearer.

672
00:55:33,279 --> 00:55:38,800
What I think is interesting and puzzling is, we're now in 324.

673
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:43,760
What makes part of the field count as an object in motion and another as background?

674
00:55:43,759 --> 00:55:47,279
In the way in which we establish our relationship to them by the act of looking.

675
00:55:47,279 --> 00:55:55,440
Okay, we know now that looking determines which is going to count as motion and which is going to count as background.

676
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:05,040
So we want to know what is the sort of phenomenal character of the motion looking part and the background looking part.

677
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:08,800
That's a funny question, hard to get a grip on, but that's what he's asking.

678
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,599
Okay, so we goes to the stone.

679
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:15,880
Never mind now this relative stuff with the trains, just any old thing.

680
00:56:09,759 --> 00:56:17,399
The stone flies through the air.

681
00:56:17,719 --> 00:56:28,760
What do these words mean, other than that our gaze, lodged and anchored in the garden, is attracted by the stone and so to speak, drags at its anchor.

682
00:56:28,759 --> 00:56:39,080
I like that because I think I can understand it, that I'm not sure I understand the question or the answer, but here's what I think he's saying, that it's got to do with maximum grip again.

683
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:42,120
That's what amuses me, though he doesn't mention maximum grip.

684
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:47,240
But what is it that my regard drags it with its anchor?

685
00:56:47,239 --> 00:56:52,040
Well, there's this stone going by, and I'm trying to get a good look at it.

686
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:56,840
But unfortunately, I'm anchored here on the ground in my garden.

687
00:56:56,839 --> 00:57:07,400
But the fact that it's getting more and more out of my grip as it goes through the air, that's the experience of it being the one that's in motion.

688
00:57:07,399 --> 00:57:17,640
The one that's in motion is the one on which you would like to have a better grip than you've got by running after it and getting a better look at it, but you can't.

689
00:57:18,199 --> 00:57:20,039
I think that's what's happening here.

690
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,160
Let me just make a little more.

691
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:25,400
So that's what it is for me to drag it my anchor.

692
00:57:25,399 --> 00:57:30,360
That is, it's me wanting to get an optimal grip because I'm paying attention to it.

693
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:32,519
That's why it looks like the thing moving.

694
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,199
I'm paying attention to it.

695
00:57:34,199 --> 00:57:37,719
And it looks furthermore like it's moving.

696
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:46,759
Now, otherwise, if you just separated it from the background, it looks like it's moving because I want to run after it and get a better look at it, and I can't.

697
00:57:46,759 --> 00:57:47,559
I think.

698
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:51,800
The relation between the moving object and its background passes through our body.

699
00:57:51,799 --> 00:57:54,359
How is its body mediation being conceived?

700
00:57:54,359 --> 00:58:00,719
How does it come about that the relation of objects to it can differentiate them as motion and rest?

701
00:58:01,279 --> 00:58:10,240
And then he says lots of things, but I never got it any clearer than I just did because he goes off on eye movements at that point.

702
00:58:10,239 --> 00:58:12,640
And it doesn't, he doesn't say more about this.

703
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,959
But let me see if I can, yeah.

704
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:15,759
Yeah.

705
00:58:15,759 --> 00:58:17,279
Well, now I'm getting confused.

706
00:58:17,279 --> 00:58:21,919
And I understand the stones lying across the garden, and you're anchored in the garden.

707
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,039
That's your background.

708
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:27,279
If you want to get a mask for the stone, they're ripping you.

709
00:58:27,279 --> 00:58:38,560
But if you're, though, in a car, and this happens all the time, and you're looking out the window, you're moving actually at a speed, and there are posts, there are telephone posts going by.

710
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:47,120
In one case, you're anchored in movement, yet you want to get a maskful grip on a post that's going by, or if the posts are going by, how is that explained?

711
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:48,719
That's good.

712
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:50,879
This is the kind of thing that was bothering me, though.

713
00:58:50,879 --> 00:58:54,959
I couldn't quite focus it, but I was asking myself things like this.

714
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:04,399
When one train moves away, you're anchored there, and suppose it's your train that's moving, and the other train looks blurry.

715
00:59:04,399 --> 00:59:06,000
It's the same question as yours.

716
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:13,199
Then why don't you see the train that you're moving away from and you're losing your grip on is moving?

717
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:14,319
I worried about that.

718
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:15,920
Let me see what I've decided.

719
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,040
Go ahead.

720
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,519
I think it actually goes further.

721
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,199
Why doesn't one look stable?

722
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:24,959
I mean, why isn't there a certain stability in one and not in both?

723
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:25,920
There's no stability.

724
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,199
No, no, I think there is.

725
00:59:27,199 --> 00:59:28,959
I mean, the car is stable.

726
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,360
I mean, let's try to sort out these two examples.

727
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:32,959
The background is stable.

728
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,319
I mean, you're not having any, I mean, it's a framework.

729
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,999
I see your framework is moving.

730
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,919
Yes, your car is stable and moving.

731
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,279
I'm, uh, just in other columns.

732
00:59:42,279 --> 00:59:42,600
Yeah.

733
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,319
Very easy to talk to me about it.

734
00:59:45,399 --> 00:59:45,640
Yeah.

735
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:57,559
Your mother's not going to be good for the copy is moving and very still for it is because you can mention it, but it still looks like it's moving.

736
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:02,839
There's no correlation between the stillness and grip.

737
01:00:02,839 --> 01:00:04,279
I don't even know what it looks like.

738
01:00:04,279 --> 01:00:05,000
It's moving.

739
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:05,879
I mean, it looks like.

740
01:00:05,879 --> 01:00:07,880
I mean, you know that it's moving.

741
01:00:08,199 --> 01:00:17,560
But it seems to me that you were so good if you could meet the baseball right in the middle of your video and with all its parts internally, you could see the themes and everything.

742
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:22,199
And you can't be that good if you're a majorly outfielder.

743
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:24,679
Then I'm not sure the object looks like it's moving.

744
01:00:24,679 --> 01:00:30,679
It seems to me what it does is that you know it's moving and you're moving and you better get there when it gets there.

745
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,039
What would make it look like it was moving?

746
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:41,000
An object stationary in your visual field with all of its details clear against the blue sky.

747
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,999
What would be the moving look about?

748
01:00:43,399 --> 01:00:53,160
If you aren't losing a grip on it at all, if you aren't trying to get a better grip than you've got and failing, I just think it was a little party.

749
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:56,919
Well, this diagram is made.

750
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,839
The sky is really watching.

751
01:00:59,719 --> 01:01:01,719
You can move your eyes with it.

752
01:01:01,879 --> 01:01:04,599
It still strikes in your visual field.

753
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:08,279
But the diagram gives us, well, I'm picturing you're looking straight up at a flyball.

754
01:01:08,279 --> 01:01:14,520
You've got nothing but a blue sky and a stationary quote, a ball that's hanging there in the middle of your visual field.

755
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:15,719
You're running like mad.

756
01:01:15,719 --> 01:01:17,480
You've got all the details.

757
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:21,559
You know surely that it's moving, and you, because you're running.

758
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:24,120
But I don't see that it was won't moving, according to me.

759
01:01:24,279 --> 01:01:30,399
Well, you want to say what highlighting is sort of the same between nerves moving and then it's both running.

760
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:31,359
Well, I am trying to make that.

761
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:34,799
I used to be a multi-per-multivert.

762
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:40,160
And this digital development, when somebody fixes what's called a knuckleball, the ball doesn't spin.

763
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,560
It just comes at you.

764
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:46,879
And you can actually see like the antigon on there.

765
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:49,439
And it honestly doesn't feel like it's moving.

766
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:53,279
You know, it's just like, but I know it's moving, so I'm going to test it thing.

767
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,880
It's over there and I'm here.

768
01:01:54,879 --> 01:01:57,119
But it actually doesn't look like it's moving.

769
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:57,999
Well, good.

770
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:05,679
But I mean, all this is interesting, but I feel uneasy only that I haven't got the basic grip on this much.

771
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:12,080
I mean, let's go to the Jennifer's puzzle, because it seems to me somehow we've got to solve that one first.

772
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:14,479
I had this story about the car.

773
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,160
Oh, no, I just got stumped.

774
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:25,199
But where we got stumped was the idea of a stable background which is moving, because that's what this funny thing is about being in a train or being in a car.

775
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:28,640
I think we're supposed to say, it's sort of related to what I said to Alva.

776
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,199
I don't think you experience the cars moving.

777
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:35,999
You experience the post going by as nerving, and they're moving because you can't get a grip on them.

778
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:36,880
So it's okay.

779
01:02:36,879 --> 01:02:37,199
Okay.

780
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:39,279
Did you give it to me to help me or that?

781
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:40,000
No, I think that's not a problem.

782
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,279
No, I think it's okay.

783
01:02:41,279 --> 01:02:42,400
Okay, go ahead.

784
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:45,839
By the way, look, and that isn't what's moving.

785
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:49,120
I mean, it could be if you were running or something, but so maybe that's.

786
01:02:49,279 --> 01:02:58,080
I think that's irrelevant to this remark, because sometimes you experience your body as moving, and you experience the cars moving, too.

787
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,999
That would be what?

788
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,879
How would that happen?

789
01:03:00,879 --> 01:03:06,960
That would be because it stopped being the background, and you were concentrating on it.

790
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,199
How do you experience your body as moving?

791
01:03:09,279 --> 01:03:11,080
Did you talk about that in your section?

792
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,080
Not that I've known.

793
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,160
Uh more college.

794
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:16,359
Rick, you want to say something about this?

795
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,679
I hope that's well I don't know.

796
01:03:18,679 --> 01:03:23,960
When I'm driving, you know, when I'm feeding, I feel like I'm going back.

797
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:26,040
I don't feel like the background is going back.

798
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:31,239
I feel like I'm just hauling and that I really need to watch out that I'm going to hit something like a, you know.

799
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:32,040
Okay, good.

800
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,679
When I'm running, I feel myself moving.

801
01:03:34,679 --> 01:03:38,279
So there's kind of appropriate sexual elements, emotional awareness.

802
01:03:38,279 --> 01:03:44,600
You know, but when yeah, I mean, when you're in your convertible and you feel the, you know, the faster you go, the more the air is going to happen.

803
01:03:44,839 --> 01:03:55,160
If you factor, try to, if you factor all that out, though, no gigglies, no danger, no wind in your hair, you're just going along in your car moving.

804
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:56,439
Do you really feel the moving?

805
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:57,719
No bumps, that's not fair.

806
01:03:57,719 --> 01:03:59,239
I mean, that's all outside of...

807
01:03:59,239 --> 01:04:00,439
Well, you're talking about major moving.

808
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:01,560
It's like playing, you know, it's like...

809
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:06,839
Well, just trying to distinguish the accidental cues from the essential cues.

810
01:04:06,839 --> 01:04:13,080
I mean, I think Merlot Fonte thinks there's an essential cue, and it's got to do with this dragging at the anchor.

811
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:20,199
And that's, I think, but I'm not sure that that's only natural that he would think it, because he always wants to bring it back to maximum grip.

812
01:04:20,199 --> 01:04:31,000
And the only way to bring it back to maximum grip is to say that when you're focusing on something and you see it as moving, you see it as you would like to get a better grip on it and you can't.

813
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,359
The posts going by.

814
01:04:32,759 --> 01:04:33,479
I'm not sure.

815
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:46,439
This seems like why maximum grip may be the right idea, Karen, because when you perceive something as moving, it is the case that you implicitly understand very that we in some sense are aware, but the crop gate, you do need to do stuff.

816
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:49,080
You do need to move to keep it in view.

817
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:52,439
You do need to alter your relationship to it to maintain access to it.

818
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,839
And isn't that on the on my side, so to speak?

819
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:58,880
That is, you're trying to get a better grip on it, and you have to move to do it.

820
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:01,279
That's part of, I mean, there must be two sides.

821
01:05:01,279 --> 01:05:05,679
I don't know what's in here, but it looks like you've got one piece of it, and I've got one piece of it.

822
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:11,119
Either you drag at your anchor, which is what he says, or you move your anchor, which is what you said.

823
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:15,120
You pick your anchor up, and then you run to try to get a better grip on it.

824
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:19,679
I'm trying to describe it in the more geometrical way than in the more essential way.

825
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:20,080
Okay.

826
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:24,160
Because it just means that you really may not have it.

827
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,640
It's also your child's right around.

828
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:28,959
And it's in a very small confined space.

829
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:33,679
And the child is never engaged by any outer grip.

830
01:05:34,879 --> 01:05:36,399
That's a better counterexample.

831
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:37,679
I don't know what to say about that.

832
01:05:37,679 --> 01:05:38,960
I see the problem.

833
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:39,439
Yeah.

834
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:42,799
Maybe maximum grip doesn't work very well here.

835
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:45,759
And maybe he doesn't mention it because it doesn't work very well here.

836
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:49,119
But then I can't make any sense of this passage.

837
01:05:49,120 --> 01:06:07,199
Otherwise, you haven't got an alternative reading of the middle of 324 for the child because he seems to say that what makes some part of the field count as an object in motion, why it should be the child and not the playpen that's in motion, depends on this anchor phenomenon.

838
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:08,559
That might just be wrong.

839
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:12,160
What's the relation between anchorage and maximum grip?

840
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,719
Because it seems like this is all about grip is happening.

841
01:06:14,879 --> 01:06:16,640
No, no, this is not just about anchorage.

842
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,239
That would be a foreground-background issue.

843
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:18,879
That's a question.

844
01:06:18,879 --> 01:06:19,520
What is the relation?

845
01:06:19,759 --> 01:06:20,799
Okay, I'm going to tell you.

846
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:24,879
It isn't just a foreground-background.

847
01:06:24,879 --> 01:06:26,719
That's the way he introduced anchor.

848
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:31,839
Because the anchor is in the stable framework relative to which things move.

849
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:35,599
But now he's got this funny phenomenon, which I was so interested in trying to figure out.

850
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:37,359
It's pulling at the anchor.

851
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:39,840
That's where I think is where you introduce maximum grip.

852
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:42,199
Why is it pulling the anchor?

853
01:06:42,519 --> 01:06:58,359
Well, look, he says that when you try to ask the question, which is in most movement, he says you're lodged and anchored in the garden, and you're attracted by the stone, which, so to speak, drags at its anchors.

854
01:06:58,359 --> 01:07:04,120
Now, I can't believe the stone is dragging at its anchors, because it looks like it says that.

855
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,920
It must be that you are dragging at your anchor in order to.

856
01:07:07,319 --> 01:07:11,479
I made this up: that you're dragging at your anchor to get a better grip of the stone.

857
01:07:11,479 --> 01:07:19,559
That is, you'll run to see it better, or at least you feel, sort of Sean-like point, you feel if only I could keep up with it, I could see it better, but I can't.

858
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:28,920
So, to the question, your view would be that through the gaze, the gaze is anchored in a kind of background way, something stable, I guess.

859
01:07:29,239 --> 01:07:31,239
And the background is what motion or tension.

860
01:07:31,399 --> 01:07:34,599
I would find the maximum grip, and we can't, unless you're dragging.

861
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:35,479
We're trying.

862
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:39,399
That's what I think he thinks, but I'm not sure.

863
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:40,040
Yeah.

864
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:59,559
Well, you're saying the increase in the background, your anchorage is in the background, but since the lodge is in the middle sounds, it could be one in the background, and the body is where the acreage happens, and then either last, which is messages, both the background and the object.

865
01:07:59,639 --> 01:08:03,080
So, since you're in the acreage, you're the absolute within the value.

866
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:08,120
So, for you, you're an absolute here, and you can perceive both of the things that went throughout the middle.

867
01:08:08,599 --> 01:08:10,679
No, you went back to the first piece.

868
01:08:11,479 --> 01:08:15,559
There are two points, one clear point, that your body is an absolute.

869
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:24,359
It anchors you somewhere in the train or in the car or in the classroom, and that's the zero background relative to which there's motion.

870
01:08:24,359 --> 01:08:26,239
I think we all agree about that.

871
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:27,759
Your body is the background.

872
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:32,399
I mean, it's the sort of that's the first meaning of anchoring.

873
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:36,160
Your body, wherever your body is anchored, counts as the background.

874
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,679
I think he says that.

875
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:39,679
It might not be a third term here.

876
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,359
I mean, sometimes it's a third term.

877
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:43,679
But right now, that's all he just says.

878
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:44,479
Yes, James.

879
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:51,040
You're assuming that maximum growth is something you actually achieve.

880
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,599
And I thought we it rejected that by.

881
01:08:53,599 --> 01:08:54,559
Yes, you're always trying.

882
01:08:57,519 --> 01:09:01,679
So you're in the outfield and you're felt to keep in track with the ball coming towards you.

883
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:06,000
You don't need to characterize the success as constantly achieving maximum growth.

884
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,519
We can characterize it as constantly ensuring you're getting a better or something like that.

885
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:12,239
That would be fine.

886
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:13,439
So it is nothing.

887
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,239
Is that matter?

888
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:17,040
And tracking the ball as it comes towards you.

889
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:19,919
Which side of the side.

890
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:20,960
Okay, well, then it has to be true.

891
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:22,959
I want to go back to this.

892
01:09:23,599 --> 01:09:29,359
So because I hope, and maybe I can't get done with it, but I think I can.

893
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:32,000
So, but it's on 326.

894
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,279
I think that's it.

895
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:36,799
Okay, then I want to say something about jump to 343.

896
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:39,919
That's what I was hoping to get to, because we're finishing space there.

897
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,199
And that's pretty quick.

898
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:43,359
But it's got a lot of interesting things in it.

899
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:51,439
And it's all about this business of what the woostering or not.

900
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:57,599
And how and is the do we get fooled how do we get fooled in experience and so forth?

901
01:09:57,599 --> 01:10:00,479
I'm just going to hit the highlights in five minutes.

902
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:05,439
And that is on face 346 and 347.

903
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:23,559
There is something like you can, he says, tell the difference between illusion and perception, because you can, if it's a perception, then you can find out more and more about it.

904
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:37,399
And you can, if you can't find out more and more about it by investigating it, if you can, then it's on the real, even if it may turn out retroactively to be wrong.

905
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:38,759
That's interesting.

906
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:41,319
It's not experienced as an illusion.

907
01:10:41,319 --> 01:10:44,040
Oh boy, I'm not going to get these data clear.

908
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:47,080
There are two issues going on in these pages, I guess.

909
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:53,719
One is how you experience the illusion illusory from the real.

910
01:10:54,040 --> 01:11:09,719
And second, since he admits that sometimes you're fooled, how you could turn out to be fooled in your experience of the difference between the illusory and the real and mistake something for real, which isn't there.

911
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:12,359
And his example is the stone on the path.

912
01:11:12,359 --> 01:11:14,359
You think that there's a stone on the path.

913
01:11:14,359 --> 01:11:17,799
This is starting at 346.

914
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:25,319
The difference, five, four lines down, the difference between illusion and perception is intrinsic, and the truth of perception can be read off from perception itself.

915
01:11:25,319 --> 01:11:31,639
See, that's the strong claim that it really looks different if it's illusory and if it's a perception.

916
01:11:31,639 --> 01:11:42,679
And that's odd, but he says, so you've got this stone, and you draw nearer, and it turns out to be a patch of sunlight.

917
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:49,639
The flat stone, like all things in the distance, appears only as a field of confused structure in which the connections are not yet articulated.

918
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:58,799
In this sense, the illusion, like the image, is not observable, which means that my body has no grip on it, and that I cannot help behold it before.

919
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:08,000
So, up to a certain point, you can't tell whether something is a real thing or an illusion, because you can't get a grip on it.

920
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,199
But then you can get a grip on it.

921
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:17,040
And when you do get a grip on it, then it looks experience quite differently than illusion.

922
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:23,359
You can experience it as what you can get a better grip on, find out more about, explore, and so forth.

923
01:12:23,359 --> 01:12:24,880
And that's important, okay?

924
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:32,639
There's a difference in your experience between what you take to be real because you've got a grip on it and what you don't know yet.

925
01:12:32,639 --> 01:12:38,879
But then, he says in the next sentence, and yet I'm capable of omitting this distinction and falling into illusion.

926
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:39,679
Why?

927
01:12:40,319 --> 01:12:57,599
Because you don't want to know, so to speak, or you don't care, or you've taken a drug or something, and you're not making the demand on your experience that you don't decide whether it's real or not until you've explored it.

928
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,279
Then you can have all kinds of ghosts and phantoms in your experience.

929
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:06,080
And come back to that in another chapter.

930
01:13:08,559 --> 01:13:10,080
But now there's a third point.

931
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,559
This only seems happening three pages.

932
01:13:12,559 --> 01:13:27,359
But nonetheless, and this is the last point, even when you do get a maximum grip, and you now have a difference of experience between the vague kind of experience where you can't tell whether it's an illusion or not, like the stone from a dinner.

933
01:13:27,599 --> 01:13:29,839
Now you've got a real grip on it.

934
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,439
It still continues to be.

935
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,679
That's this business of, say, the girl on Telegraph Avenue or the back of the house.

936
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:40,679
It looks like it's perfectly clear.

937
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,199
It's just sort of indeterminate.

938
01:13:42,519 --> 01:13:48,439
But lo and behold, when you go to make it more determinate, it turns out to be something else.

939
01:13:48,439 --> 01:13:51,639
And you just have to accept that.

940
01:13:51,639 --> 01:13:53,959
That's something that can happen.

941
01:13:53,960 --> 01:14:00,199
And that's why the illusion reality issue is not totally a mistake.

942
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:12,839
Even though you can tell in your experience the difference between the difference between the experience of illusion and experience of reality, the experience of reality can turn out to be wrong.

943
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:14,439
And it can't turn out that.

944
01:14:14,439 --> 01:14:16,040
It's an illusion.

945
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,639
And then what happens?

946
01:14:17,639 --> 01:14:20,199
Well, then you have to correct them.

947
01:14:20,199 --> 01:14:27,479
And then you get this business at the top of 347 of crossing out the previous illusion and regarding it as known void.

948
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:30,120
That's what happens with the girl.

949
01:14:30,439 --> 01:14:33,160
Retroactively, it turns out to be a man.

950
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:40,919
And retroactively, it turns out to be a man, and then I have to retroactively see it differently, even from the back.

951
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:46,839
As he says about the stone, everything gets changed when you discover that it's an illusion.

952
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,599
Let's see where he says that.

953
01:14:50,439 --> 01:14:52,920
But that's relevant to what we're talking about.

954
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:55,080
Well, I can't find it right away.

955
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:56,359
So let me go on.

956
01:14:56,359 --> 01:15:05,559
So what you've got is this complicated thing that you never can be totally an illusion.

957
01:15:05,559 --> 01:15:07,479
That's the last point I want to make.

958
01:15:07,479 --> 01:15:19,639
He says it's always in the light of taking what you're currently experiencing as not an illusion, that you cross out the previous as an illusion.

959
01:15:19,639 --> 01:15:22,120
No, I can't talk there, there's only one minute left.

960
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:39,519
You cross out the previous as an illusion, but it's always in terms of something else that you take as you have the experience of it being real, and you take it to be real, you put your trust in the world, as he put, I put my confidence in the world, as he says at the bottom of 346.

961
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:47,759
And that means that it's always in terms of something else which you now take to be real, that you cross out what's previous.

962
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:54,559
And that leads him to his kind of answer to skepticism about handling from the bottom of 347.

963
01:15:54,559 --> 01:16:00,479
There is the absolute certainty of the world in general, but not of any one thing in particular.

964
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:08,160
That means that somehow you've always got a grip on something, I put it in my grip terms.

965
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:14,080
And you can trust in general, and you do trust, that whatever you get a grip on is real.

966
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:23,279
But there's no guarantee that it may not turn out to be a facade, or the girl may turn out to be a guy, or the stone may turn out to be a spot of sunlight.

967
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:29,679
And it may always, therefore, always be the case that about any particular thing, you have to take it back.

968
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:40,319
And it's always on the basis of a basic attunement you've got with the world, which he thinks you couldn't possibly take back, that you do corrections within it.

969
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:40,880
One last comment.

970
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:42,719
Empirical realism.

971
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:44,479
I mean, we're now getting out of idealism.

972
01:16:44,639 --> 01:16:47,599
This is a strongest statement I've seen that is anti-idealism.

973
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:49,040
Yes, yes, yes.

974
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,359
Well, I'll say something to you, but don't you get confused.

975
01:16:51,359 --> 01:16:52,160
Don't you listen.

976
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:56,800
But I mean, but empirical realism is a kind of idealism in Kant, so don't say that.

977
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,040
That's just further confusing.

978
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:00,399
Okay, that's it.
