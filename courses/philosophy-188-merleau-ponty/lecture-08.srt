00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,241
Okay, now, when we're going to do the phantom limb.

2
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:19,120
And that starts out where he starts out with the long-headed view, which I just repeat because it's important to keep repeating it.

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,560
And it's important to keep repeating it because it's the view that everybody holds.

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,120
It isn't some minority, fringe, kooky view.

5
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:35,080
It's a very, very popular, and according to Merlot-Ponty and Walter Freeman at least, and maybe other people too, but I don't know them.

6
00:00:35,961 --> 00:01:02,601
Long-headed view, mainly that the world is a kind of transmitter, and the sense organs are receivers and transducers, and then the information is then passively, you know, the world impinges on the sense organs, and that sends the energy which contains the information about the world up to several stages in the brain until finally, magically, in the last stage, it becomes us and our experience of things.

7
00:01:02,601 --> 00:01:16,121
He then writes that at about six lines down, where it was now in 84, where it was desired to insert the organism in the universe of objects and thereby close off that universe.

8
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:34,921
It was necessary, that is, put everything in the world of objects, it was necessary to translate, and this is Descartes, translate the functioning of the body into the language of the in itself and discover beneath behavior the linear dependence of stimulator and receptor, receptor and receiver.

9
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:42,361
And that's, and that the linear is jargon that Walter Freeman uses too.

10
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:51,080
That linear is just his name for the long sword of causality where it comes from out there to here to higher eccenters and so forth.

11
00:01:51,081 --> 00:02:11,241
And what's missing in that story, in some form or other, is this kind of feedback loop in which what the sense organs are already attuned to, as he says, looking for, Walter Freeman says, what is significantly important to the organism at that point?

12
00:02:11,241 --> 00:02:12,680
That's part of the feedback.

13
00:02:12,681 --> 00:02:18,361
It isn't that the sense organ just sits there passively and collects whatever comes in.

14
00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:25,561
And another part of the feedback is what he once or twice calls the intentional arc.

15
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:32,120
There are these very important ideas in Merlot-Conte that are so basic and important that he never actually schematizes them.

16
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,760
He just takes them as his way of dealing with things.

17
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:53,361
The intentional arc is that as I gain experience with what is significant in the world, that changes the way I pick up information from the world so that the world I don't need to have a representation of the world.

18
00:02:53,361 --> 00:02:55,521
The world is its own representation.

19
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,040
And I don't need to update my representation of the world.

20
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,041
What gets updated is the world looks different to me before I learn about it.

21
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,640
I think it's in this section, is it?

22
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:12,960
Or no, maybe I was reading Gibson, where he says after the child's been putting fire looks different to the child.

23
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:18,081
Yeah, right.

24
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:18,321
Okay.

25
00:03:18,721 --> 00:03:20,081
Well, the problem is.

26
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:20,801
Yeah, right.

27
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,161
Okay, yeah, it's in there.

28
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,081
And that's the intentional arc.

29
00:03:24,081 --> 00:03:29,841
That says that the significance of things gets back in the world in the look of things.

30
00:03:29,841 --> 00:03:36,241
So there's no, you can't have this linear view, but there's stuff out there which just comes in.

31
00:03:36,241 --> 00:03:38,161
One, I have to be set to receive it.

32
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,241
Two, what's out there gets changed by what experience I've had.

33
00:03:42,241 --> 00:03:46,161
That's going along in the background of what he's talking about.

34
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,481
That reminds me of something I want to say about the lecture coming up on Tuesday.

35
00:03:51,120 --> 00:04:16,321
Because I discovered in office hours and in talking that though I talk about Gibson every once in a while, and he talks about the Gestaltas a lot, he never explains, and I never explain in some kind of systematic, clear way, who the Gefaltas were, what they were up to, and who Gibson is and what he was up to, and how they're both related to each other in Merle-Ponte.

36
00:04:16,321 --> 00:04:25,961
Well, we're lucky we've got Rick, one of the TAs, who was a psychology major as an undergraduate in a Gibsonian and knows that stuff.

37
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:28,761
So on Tuesday, Rick is going to talk about these things.

38
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,241
Is there anything they're supposed to read in preparation for this?

39
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,961
I think it's better just to stick to the Merloponcy.

40
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,760
That's what I think.

41
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,481
I mean, I don't think you should be, you can get enough trouble.

42
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,000
It's a lot easier reading Gibson than the Gefeltas, but this is what we have to read.

43
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,281
Yeah, the Groin Heidegger's in the world.

44
00:04:46,441 --> 00:04:48,040
I thought you were, but we've got to be careful.

45
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,241
Again, how many have had the Being in Time course?

46
00:04:52,681 --> 00:04:55,880
You've got half the people who know what you're going to say, and half the people who need to know.

47
00:04:56,201 --> 00:04:56,601
No, they don't.

48
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:58,601
Well, they don't, because it's in relations here.

49
00:04:58,681 --> 00:04:58,841
Okay.

50
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:10,520
Okay, so we're going to go bring in Heidegger and tell you enough about Heidegger, which is, after all, as much as an important part of the background of this book as we felt psychology is.

51
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,441
I mean, being in the world is this notion he has all over the place.

52
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:16,521
So he's changed it a lot from Heidegger.

53
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,241
There's the basic, basic idea still thing.

54
00:05:21,241 --> 00:05:31,401
Okay, so there's this wrong dominant view, and then he goes on to tell you what he thinks is the right view on 86, the next page at the bottom.

55
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,680
What's wrong with it is, well, I think I listed one of them here that I thought was neat.

56
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,081
Three things wrong with it.

57
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:44,120
First, I'll say it my way, and then I'll see if that's what I said in my notes.

58
00:05:44,120 --> 00:06:08,801
I mean, to repeat what I said just a minute ago that was wrong with it, is that it's got this uh view of us as passive receivers of the world out there who then use our sense organs to get in the information and then construct a representation which we then have to update as we get more information, whereas that's wrong for two reasons, remember I said.

59
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:18,401
One, because what comes into the sense organ is already determined by what we're looking for, what we're set for, what we're, as you put it in here, attuned to.

60
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:38,641
And what we're attuned to is already determined by our past experience, which, and this is the other important point, isn't something we add to our incoming data, but the world itself, the perceptual world, changes its its appearance on the basis of our experience.

61
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,760
So again, we don't need to represent represent what the flame means, to use the example in here.

62
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,801
The flame comes to look dangerous.

63
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:54,160
That's all not the linear and receptive view of how we're related to the world.

64
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,481
That's the point.

65
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,481
Well, it's not very basic.

66
00:06:58,481 --> 00:06:59,520
You did, is it?

67
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,241
Why not?

68
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:14,161
I mean, any assume that, you know, just the attention of the statement, well, it doesn't take up well, let me add a third, but but part of what I was saying was not quite that, though I did say that and that, you're right, it wasn't clear enough.

69
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:29,521
And this attuning is changing, depending on what, one, what I what I'm looking for, and two, what I've already experienced, so that I'm going to be attuned to the candle flame differently if I'm hot if I'm and to the heat where I'm warm or cold and so forth.

70
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:36,481
That's that it's not a fixed attunement like the radio tune to the set of stations, period.

71
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:39,520
It's an attunement which is going to change constantly.

72
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,801
So that maybe makes it all right.

73
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:56,681
But the other thing, the other problem is that anybody who believes in the receiver as in the model grant could grant as a psychological and phenomenological data that you experience the brain as the voter has returned.

74
00:07:56,681 --> 00:08:04,201
The question is, ah, giant the assumption that all the action reaches you from that frame is over there.

75
00:08:04,201 --> 00:08:05,241
It is light.

76
00:08:05,561 --> 00:08:06,441
Good, good.

77
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:07,000
So that's...

78
00:08:07,241 --> 00:08:08,441
How do you experience it?

79
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,841
Well, I don't cut it.

80
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,760
Okay, well, I think now we're going to get off in a dirt direction.

81
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,440
I guess it's okay to go.

82
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:33,000
Of course, you'd have to have a brain story that was not a receiver brain story because there'd be two stages which fit together for him and fit together for me because we've got Walter Freeman.

83
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:36,681
But he's already got a glimmer of the brain story.

84
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:56,441
But what you need is two things, a phenomenological description, which is what he gets from the Gestaltists and what Gibson gets from him, of the way the world changes its appearance as I learn more and more about it and its significance to me and what I'm interested in.

85
00:08:56,441 --> 00:08:57,721
That's the first thing.

86
00:08:57,721 --> 00:08:59,721
And, of course, Alvin is right.

87
00:08:59,721 --> 00:09:29,561
That would be magical, even in a sense, too magical for Merlot Ponte, if you didn't tell a brain story of how it was possible, given that there is this, all there is, is an organism being bombarded with energy from the whole world, that we could have this experience instead of what would seem to be the sensible Cartesian one that we make, we put all this information together in the brain and build up a representation in the brain.

88
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:34,560
And that wouldn't, by the way, probably give you the right phenomenology.

89
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:42,961
I believe Hart didn't think that flames looked different after people were burned by them, or if he did, he didn't think it was important.

90
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:53,681
So we need a brain story that will give you the phenomenological description of perception, and we need to see how that could happen.

91
00:09:53,681 --> 00:10:02,481
Okay, well, but whenever I talk about Walter Freeman, I feel bad because I start using a bunch of jargon that I don't fully understand myself.

92
00:10:02,481 --> 00:10:07,201
But let me try it again because it's so important.

93
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:20,721
The picture Walter Freeman has is that on the basis of my experience of, say, being burnt by candles and nourished by carrots, he does rabbits.

94
00:10:20,961 --> 00:10:29,040
So I make connections of a traditional sort, but what's called Hebbian connections.

95
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:37,201
So the connection between the rabbit smell and the rabbit taste gets reinforced.

96
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:39,441
But that's not important.

97
00:10:39,441 --> 00:10:42,320
That's what's interesting and hard to explain.

98
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:59,040
But the whole brain gets tuned, is constantly going into a kind of chaotic mode and then settling into certain minimal energy states, which are called attractors.

99
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,800
And which minimal energy basically occurs it settles into is based on its experience.

100
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:26,600
So, with experiencing carrots and discovering that they're good to eat, not only does it get these normal sort of connections between carrots a good thing, it gets hard for me to say how it does this, but Freeman says he can see it on his psychoscope when he's plugged into the rabbit's brain.

101
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,760
It forms a new attractor.

102
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:46,760
That is, there is a certain least energy position that that part of the brain goes into, and it adds a new attractor for every new category it gets, and for celery and for carrots and so forth, and that modifies the attractor landscape.

103
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,280
Now, this is the jargon I can't hack out very well.

104
00:11:50,280 --> 00:12:21,560
And the picture of it is now that when some stimulus comes in, because Alva's right, I mean, that is the physical level of what actually happens, it puts the brain into an attractor landscape, and depending on what significance this input has had for the organism before, it takes out some particular attractor.

105
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:31,721
And that is the organism recognizes the parrot, the rabbit does, and recognizes it as something to eat.

106
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:33,080
And it does.

107
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:46,280
What's important about that is that it depends on whether the rabbit is hungry, it depends on the past experience of the nabbit, and the input, and this is the hard part, and I can't explain it very well.

108
00:12:46,840 --> 00:13:00,520
If need be, I would say, let's get Walden Freeman over here to explain it, but unfortunately, he's so deep into it and so far from where we are that whenever he explains it, I gave two seminars with him, but I never really understood it any better than I do now.

109
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:16,560
But the input that puts the brain into this global energy state, this attractor landscape, in which there are these minimum, that input gets thrown away, as he puts it.

110
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:37,520
That is, the original stuff from the world is just enough to set up this global phenomenon which contains in it the information as to what sort of things have been good and bad for that sort of animal under those conditions.

111
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:45,520
And that's what makes it a not linear, not normal picture of how the brain works.

112
00:13:45,921 --> 00:14:02,880
On the perceptual level, it's like saying, well, when you see something, there's some array of energy on your retina, and that's going to have a certain distorted shape, and it's going to have all kinds of changes with changes in lighting and so forth.

113
00:14:02,881 --> 00:14:05,520
But that's not important.

114
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:15,680
That what's important is some invariant in that that sets the whole system, the global system, into some recognition or other.

115
00:14:15,681 --> 00:14:27,600
And the way the thing actually, what does he call it, the stimulus error, is to think that somehow the way the thing hits your retina plays an important role in the processing.

116
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,000
He thinks it just triggers the process.

117
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,961
That's very different, very important.

118
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:43,840
Now, if you want somebody to explain it to you, we might set up an extra session in which, Eric, could you explain this any better to people if we set up an extra session to do it like that?

119
00:14:44,481 --> 00:14:47,361
Okay, well then I won't then I won't make you do it.

120
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:47,481
Yeah.

121
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:50,920
This is a nice causal story at the neurophysiological well.

122
00:14:51,080 --> 00:15:08,201
And I think it's a good alpha the same, but how do you get from the causal story, which we've now given, I'm sorry, with Walter Freeman, to the fact that it's now the landscape has an appearance, a phenomenal appearance such as beautiful.

123
00:15:09,961 --> 00:15:11,721
That's the qualia question.

124
00:15:11,721 --> 00:15:14,120
So there's two separate questions.

125
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:29,241
Freeman thinks he's got a story, so complicated that neither Eric nor I could explain it very well, of how the organism picks up the significance of what it's dealing with directly and is attuned to the significance of what it's dealing with.

126
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:42,360
Directly in that the brain already just goes into a state on the basis of the input that can that and that state was formed by its previous experience with the significance of the input.

127
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,201
But it's not like a representation.

128
00:15:44,201 --> 00:15:49,880
It's not like some description of the input plus an additional factor, namely good to eat.

129
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:59,241
It is something that's tied directly up with the action so that when it has that kind of input, it gets set to go and eat it.

130
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:12,601
So Freeman has a way of trying to describe how the brain can take up directly the significance of what it encounters in the world and how that's going to change as it encounters more things in the world.

131
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,320
It fits the phenomenology, the Meryl-Ponte phenomenology.

132
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,880
And he says, and this is part of the confusion, and therefore, he's explaining consciousness.

133
00:16:21,921 --> 00:16:23,321
And you heard it, and you think that.

134
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:39,201
Anyway, consciousness has these two aspects, picking up the meaning and picking up the qualia or the feeling, you know, the sensual experience, the conscious experience of, say, melanchari.

135
00:16:39,681 --> 00:16:41,041
He doesn't make that distinction.

136
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,400
He's happy just to say, well, we picked up the significance.

137
00:16:44,401 --> 00:16:45,840
What more do you want?

138
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:52,961
And somebody like John Sydney says, well, what we really want is what's the conscious qualia aspect of all this.

139
00:16:52,961 --> 00:16:58,000
And it isn't as if Walter thinks that's a good question and he thinks he doesn't have an answer.

140
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,361
He doesn't really hear the question.

141
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,600
He just thinks that's a non-question.

142
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,641
I mean, I don't, I mean, that's the best I can say about it.

143
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:04,881
Yeah.

144
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,880
Does that fit your experience?

145
00:17:06,881 --> 00:17:07,520
Yeah, that's right.

146
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:07,680
Yeah.

147
00:17:07,921 --> 00:17:12,880
Just to clarify what you said, so Freeman is giving you all the glory because we kind of call out.

148
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:13,201
Yes.

149
00:17:13,441 --> 00:17:14,080
And good.

150
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:21,040
And what's interesting, which you haven't mentioned yet, is that it's not bringing into the picture an associationist understanding of memory, for example.

151
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,640
There's learning, but the learning is in this kind of.

152
00:17:24,881 --> 00:17:25,201
That's right.

153
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:37,361
It's not a representationalist or it's not an empiricist notion of learning, which that didn't work out because these impressions don't call each other up until you've already recognized them, according to Merlopony.

154
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,721
And it isn't an intellectualist version, which I was really giving more of an example of.

155
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:47,201
You're not building up a representation of the world in which you're sort of having you have a description and you add more and more information.

156
00:17:47,201 --> 00:17:51,520
You're changing the world and how it shows up for you.

157
00:17:51,840 --> 00:18:00,081
Shows up for you is this interesting weasly term that Heidegger and Freeman and Merloponte like.

158
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,881
Shows up for you, you could say, well, shows up as significant, and then you'd be in their dimension.

159
00:18:04,881 --> 00:18:10,000
Shows up for you, you could mean with what qualia, then they would just say, who cares?

160
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,401
Okay, all of that is right.

161
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:26,681
It not only is a view for the fits the intentional arc, but it also fits, but I haven't been saying this well because I don't know how to say it any better, is it fits the constant the organism's trying to get a maximum grip.

162
00:18:26,681 --> 00:18:33,641
Remember that story, which that's the other secret deep thing in Merleau-Ponty that I keep stressing.

163
00:18:33,641 --> 00:18:45,961
And I find a lot of places in the Phantom Limb this kind of where in every sort of metaphor he's always talking about keeping maximum grip and never using the expression it only is used about three times in all of the meaning time.

164
00:18:45,961 --> 00:19:06,520
So it's part of the premium picture of it, that the organism is always seeking what is significant for it and seeking to get a better, clearer, more successful grip on what's important to it.

165
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:14,600
And that's why the information coming in is always already stored in terms of its importance for the organism.

166
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,760
So it's got a combination of the intentional arc and the maximum grip.

167
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:28,600
The seeking for the maximum grip is what determines what information gets built into the perception by way of the intentional arc.

168
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,040
I think those are the two most important notions in Merilloponte.

169
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:44,680
And interestingly enough, the least mentioned, and interesting enough, I just can't resist saying this, Merilloponte has a theory that every philosopher's really most important ideas he never talks about because they sort of are in the background coloring everything.

170
00:19:44,681 --> 00:19:46,760
He says that about Hustler.

171
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:52,120
Well, all I got to do is transmit that and say that about Merlot Ponty, and you've got what I was saying.

172
00:19:52,121 --> 00:19:57,721
And you'll be how many of you read Sean Kelly's paper on seeing things in Merleau-Ponty?

173
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,000
Well, when you do, you'll see that Sean is using that.

174
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:11,680
He's claiming that some third thing, which I haven't mentioned, which is his favorite given Marillopon T, is hardly ever mentioned and sometimes even contradicted.

175
00:20:11,681 --> 00:20:12,641
Okay, yeah.

176
00:20:12,641 --> 00:20:16,320
Do you think Barloboni himself would buy what previous causal story that you just gave?

177
00:20:16,401 --> 00:20:19,280
Or did he part not addressing the quality of coaches?

178
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:20,400
Yes, I think he would buy it.

179
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:21,441
I think he'd love it.

180
00:20:21,441 --> 00:20:24,641
Because he's trying to give a brain story every once in a while.

181
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:28,880
Well, at the beginning of this class, he said that these things should not be given in causal explanations.

182
00:20:28,881 --> 00:20:34,080
Instead of your partial phenomenology theory, he's not there getting descriptive notions like describe what a notice is.

183
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,920
Okay, I have a sensible thing to say.

184
00:20:37,921 --> 00:20:44,321
I think the answer to that is that when he says causal, he means what Freeman means when he says linear.

185
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:54,721
He hears causal as how the stuff from there, bombarding me and my brain as passive receivers, somehow give me a world.

186
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:55,921
And he thinks that's wrong.

187
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,201
He thinks it's circular, and he thinks I haven't stressed this.

188
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:01,040
We better throw this in holistic.

189
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:10,080
It's always the whole, what does he call it, a tracker landscape gets modified whenever I add a new experience.

190
00:21:10,401 --> 00:21:18,481
He would say that that's not, Freeman would say that's not what people normally mean by causality when they talk about the brain.

191
00:21:18,481 --> 00:21:20,400
And he's against the linear causality.

192
00:21:20,641 --> 00:21:23,440
You think Freeman's callosa is a good description.

193
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,320
He is what?

194
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,201
It's a good description.

195
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,161
Of what?

196
00:21:26,961 --> 00:21:28,560
You mean if that's a description that fits within the corner?

197
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,641
Yeah, that's right.

198
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:34,961
But it's a different kind of causality.

199
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:38,000
Let me say one more thing about it, although I don't see how it fits in.

200
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,360
It's important.

201
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,721
It comes up in what we're reading at one point, and I'll see if I could say before we get there.

202
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:50,041
No, I'll say it now, but I can't remember where why it's relevant yet.

203
00:21:50,201 --> 00:22:06,280
But Freeman has this interesting idea that there's a kind of causality where the global activity enslaves, this is the official word for this from the mathematicians who study it, the activity of the elements.

204
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:12,600
It's the whole determines the parts phenomena, which we've been describing on the perceptual level.

205
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,120
That's the Gestalt view.

206
00:22:14,121 --> 00:22:16,360
What would that look like on the brain level?

207
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:27,961
Well, that would look like a mathematics of how the global pattern that forms in the brain influences all the elements which are in there and any new element that comes in there.

208
00:22:27,961 --> 00:22:30,680
And what would that be like in the real world?

209
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:36,280
Well, it's the mathematics of storms, of hurricanes, like.

210
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:45,640
For instance, once the air gets going around in a hurricane, every other air molecule that comes into it gets to be part of it and contributes to it.

211
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:48,840
And apparently, the mathematics was worked out for lasers.

212
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,680
They do this to the ions.

213
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:54,201
So there's a kind of top-down causality.

214
00:22:54,201 --> 00:22:56,760
It still takes place in the natural world.

215
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:07,721
There's a very peculiar kind of causality in which you can't explain what's going on in terms of the elements, but you can explain it in terms of the whole pattern and how that's imposed on the elements.

216
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:27,241
But there are all these wonderful things going on, which I wish we knew more about, but it's nice to know they're there, because it means that Nero-Ponty isn't just sort of ignoring, or need just ignore the brain and say, and how this happens in the natural causal world.

217
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:34,721
He's groping every once in a while for a view of how the brain does it, that he has no clue.

218
00:23:32,921 --> 00:23:37,760
So he's mostly saying, well, there's no brain account.

219
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,520
Sometimes he goes so far as to say no brain account is possible of this.

220
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,760
Whenever he says that, and when you see it, you will be surprised because it contradicts so much what I just said.

221
00:23:47,760 --> 00:24:00,640
I think what he really means is no brain account that he can think of, or anybody can think of, at his time, with their math, which would be a linear causal account, is possible.

222
00:24:00,641 --> 00:24:02,961
It doesn't account for the very important things.

223
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:12,160
The feedback, the intentional arc, the tendency toward maximum grip, the whole determining the elements.

224
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:16,241
So he sometimes says, well, we'll never get a brain, we'll never get an account of this.

225
00:24:16,241 --> 00:24:18,800
Sometimes he says in terms of reflex physiology.

226
00:24:19,121 --> 00:24:24,400
Sometimes he says, we'll never get an account of this in terms of linear causality in the brain.

227
00:24:24,401 --> 00:24:27,760
But he really wants an account of it.

228
00:24:28,961 --> 00:24:36,481
And whether he's an idealist or not, he would like to know how this stuff up here makes perception possible.

229
00:24:36,721 --> 00:24:38,560
He's a modern person.

230
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,961
And he'd be happy with Freeman, I think.

231
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:41,280
Yeah.

232
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:47,840
Not only just obviously not a natural world causing things in just normal worlds.

233
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:54,320
And then not even those phenomenal world causing things and then natural world, but kind of back and forth all the time in this flowing kind of state.

234
00:24:54,721 --> 00:24:55,920
It's both directions all the time.

235
00:24:55,921 --> 00:24:56,080
Right.

236
00:24:56,401 --> 00:24:56,881
Right.

237
00:24:56,881 --> 00:24:57,120
Yes.

238
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,321
Yes.

239
00:24:58,481 --> 00:24:59,520
But it's still causality.

240
00:24:59,681 --> 00:24:59,840
Yes.

241
00:25:00,481 --> 00:25:00,961
Right.

242
00:25:00,961 --> 00:25:04,241
Only I think what he says, you know, he's against causality.

243
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:09,520
He means linear Cartesian transmitter-receiver causality.

244
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:10,721
Okay.

245
00:25:10,961 --> 00:25:12,881
I mean, I'm ready to go back to this.

246
00:25:12,881 --> 00:25:16,481
But that was not wasted, and it all would have come up sooner or later in this connection.

247
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:20,040
So I am very perfectly fine now.

248
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,400
So, where are we?

249
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:27,961
We've just got, again, another repetition of the view that he's against on 86.

250
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:32,121
I'll just read it because it sort of sums up again the view at the bottom of 86.

251
00:25:32,441 --> 00:25:36,600
Even the presence or absence of a perception are not de facto.

252
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,361
This is now the other view.

253
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:46,040
And then here's his answer to the Cartesian passage I read before about the receiving, receiver story.

254
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:51,481
Even the presence or absence of a perception are not de facto effects of the situation outside the organism.

255
00:25:51,481 --> 00:25:56,280
They represent the way in which it meets stimulation and is related to it.

256
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,961
This is the attunement story.

257
00:25:57,961 --> 00:26:02,520
And excitation is not perceived when it strikes a sensory organ, which is not attuned to it.

258
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:08,840
The function of the organism in receiving stimuli is, so to speak, to conceive a certain form of excitation.

259
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,400
The psychophysical event is therefore no longer of the type of worldly causality.

260
00:26:13,401 --> 00:26:18,520
The brain becomes the seat of a process of patterning, as the top gets to the top of 87.

261
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,760
So that's sort of what I was just saying.

262
00:26:21,161 --> 00:26:30,280
That's the other story, which is still a natural story and still a causal story, but it's not what he calls worldly causality.

263
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:33,880
That's what Freeman calls linear causality.

264
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:44,600
And if you notice, the brain, and thereby the organism getting in the right way to receive the stimulus, that's tied up with this attempt to get a maximum grip.

265
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:54,680
It's fundamental that the organism is always actively involved in the world trying to do something, namely get a better grip on it.

266
00:26:54,681 --> 00:27:00,600
And that's how come the stimulus gets patterned the way it gets patterned.

267
00:27:00,601 --> 00:27:04,320
That's the picture he's got to meet.

268
00:27:02,681 --> 00:27:06,401
Okay, onward.

269
00:27:08,241 --> 00:27:16,241
Now I have to catch up because I have now given you what I've got here about Freema to see if I need to say anything more if I said it okay.

270
00:27:17,201 --> 00:27:31,120
You know, I wrote about lasers and ions and storms and water drops, chaotic systems, dynamic systems, attractors, whatever this all means.

271
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:38,721
And Neil Punkey says this can't be done in third-person brain science 187.

272
00:27:39,681 --> 00:27:42,000
We're starting, right?

273
00:27:42,081 --> 00:27:45,200
We'll give a few sentences and then I'm going to read more.

274
00:27:45,201 --> 00:27:51,360
Again, now we're going back from the brain story to see how it fits the perception.

275
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,040
So he's sort of in the middle story.

276
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:54,161
No, I don't know which it is.

277
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:57,760
He's trying to find this level in which we can talk about it either way.

278
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,961
The excitation is seized and reorganized by transversal functions.

279
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:11,441
That would be this attractor landscape business, which makes it resemble the perception which it is about to arouse.

280
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,001
That means that what?

281
00:28:14,001 --> 00:28:29,760
That the organism is getting into a landscape in which there are attractors of the sort that terrorists and celery and so forth are imposed or whatever.

282
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,320
And it's going to go into one of them and it's getting ready to go into one of them.

283
00:28:34,721 --> 00:28:38,000
That's the picture, which intervenes before the cortical stage.

284
00:28:40,241 --> 00:28:45,040
Which, which from the moment the nervous system comes into play, confuses the relations of stimulus to organism.

285
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:57,161
That means as soon as something hits the rabbit, it goes into this burst of chaotic activity that's already got these attractors in it, and then it's ready to receive what's out there.

286
00:28:57,161 --> 00:29:02,760
The excitation is seized and reorganized by the transverse functions, which make it resemble and so forth.

287
00:29:03,081 --> 00:29:07,000
Now, I'm still going to read because all this is sort of sound, is his version of what I just said.

288
00:29:07,001 --> 00:29:14,921
I cannot envisage this form, which is traced out in the nervous system, the exhibiting of the structure as a set of processes in the third person.

289
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:28,601
Well, you see, that's the, it makes it sound like, well, there is no way to talk about this in terms of nature and causal forces and energy-hitting organisms.

290
00:29:28,681 --> 00:29:29,560
He's constant there.

291
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:31,400
He says, I cannot envisage.

292
00:29:31,721 --> 00:29:32,040
That's right.

293
00:29:33,081 --> 00:29:33,640
He's right?

294
00:29:33,641 --> 00:29:34,760
He's being constant.

295
00:29:35,081 --> 00:29:36,200
Yeah, at least.

296
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:41,960
But I want to say, too, or I was going to read it another way, but we can read it either way.

297
00:29:42,121 --> 00:29:44,360
A set of processes in the third person.

298
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,001
I think he means nobody can do that.

299
00:29:47,001 --> 00:29:52,600
Because I think by third person, he's got linear, he means linear causality where significance isn't in it.

300
00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:05,001
Remember, he's going to say later, you can't understand what's going on in perception or the brain without bringing in at the ground floor its significance for an organism that's seeking something.

301
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:07,560
And that's why you can't have a third-person account of this.

302
00:30:07,561 --> 00:30:08,520
That's very important.

303
00:30:09,081 --> 00:30:15,721
So one way to be correct for a brain, at least in real time, we have to understand the rabbit as a rabbit looking for food.

304
00:30:16,121 --> 00:30:16,840
And absolutely.

305
00:30:17,001 --> 00:30:20,760
And so there's a text in which you can understand it from the first person perspective of the rabbit.

306
00:30:21,161 --> 00:30:23,641
And he says as much in the part we read.

307
00:30:23,641 --> 00:30:28,760
You can't understand the sentenced limb, he says, but in general, maybe you had this back.

308
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,960
No, maybe in the cryptomechanism part, but only not because of the cryptomechanism.

309
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,440
Someplace he says you can't do it in the third person.

310
00:30:35,681 --> 00:30:42,400
You've got to, in a sense, empathize with the organism to be able to make sense of it.

311
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:44,161
It's in our reading for this kind.

312
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,480
I don't know the third person on that page, probably.

313
00:30:46,641 --> 00:30:49,840
Yeah, but there's a place where he says you've got to do it in the first person.

314
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,560
Maybe it's right there.

315
00:30:50,561 --> 00:30:51,841
Let me go on and see.

316
00:30:52,400 --> 00:31:01,120
So as transmission movement, you can't do it in the third person as the transmission of a movement or the demarcation of one variable by another.

317
00:31:01,121 --> 00:31:03,441
That's, I mean, that's back to Alvin's question.

318
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,400
If you were looking for that, do you think that he hasn't explained anything?

319
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,480
But he says that you don't need that.

320
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,241
I cannot gain a removed knowledge of it.

321
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,880
I guess this is the very thing where he's saying it, right, Greg?

322
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,600
You've got to do a first-person version.

323
00:31:17,601 --> 00:31:24,800
Insofar as I've guessed what it may be, it is by abandoning the body as an object, parts outside of parts, going back to the body.

324
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,920
I experience, yes.

325
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,880
You really have to sort of...

326
00:31:27,121 --> 00:31:29,121
Empathize with the rabbit, right?

327
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:29,760
Going back to.

328
00:31:30,001 --> 00:31:41,361
He's quite learned just a footnote that I'm quite certain that all the humans, rabbits, with brains, were involved in that kind of natural exploring.

329
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,280
Oh, yes, they were, because they were very hungry.

330
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:43,760
We don't want to.

331
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,360
No, I don't.

332
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:52,560
He's pretty ecological, and he was in charge of animal experiments.

333
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,681
He's got a.

334
00:31:53,920 --> 00:32:00,000
I know you've got a problem, but you can't, it wouldn't work for him if the rabbit weren't at least sniffing around.

335
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:00,880
But you're probably right.

336
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:03,041
It's sniffing around in the stream.

337
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:08,961
And it's very important to say that, and that's a kind of Gibsonian point.

338
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,841
But I think he thinks that you've got enough of the rabbit, the active snipping.

339
00:32:14,081 --> 00:32:16,160
The question is, how much it's moving around.

340
00:32:16,161 --> 00:32:16,960
I agree with you.

341
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,520
I don't know.

342
00:32:17,521 --> 00:32:33,001
I mean, I agree, it's pretty hard to move around with an array of 12 by 12 needles in the olfactory part of the brain, which is where the rabbit, and each one of them hooked up a wire to a complicated computer stuff.

343
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:38,280
So it'd probably be better if we could find out how it would do it without that.

344
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:50,360
But if it forms an attractor when sniffing and hungry and comes across carrots, I mean, until we proved otherwise, we better assume that it would do the same thing even if it were running around.

345
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,641
But all this is true.

346
00:32:51,641 --> 00:33:01,800
And if he was doing perception or action, instead of categorizing of stuff, he'd certainly have to, but maybe that's why he can't do it.

347
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:09,800
I mean, he's always saying, of course, the limbic system comes in here and it's very important, and that's how the animal's moving around, and it has its own attractors, but he can't study them.

348
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,960
He doesn't say, I can't study them when he's talking.

349
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,161
He's got his hands full of the rabbit all his life.

350
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:16,441
But you're right.

351
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:22,920
The only question I'm asking you is, Sorry, we don't know, I mean, the significance of the fact that the poor rabbit can't move.

352
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:27,241
Right, although you might think presentation shows that there's an incidental in the ground.

353
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,520
It doesn't go back and forth.

354
00:33:28,681 --> 00:33:31,241
Well, no, no, because it never said that it was moving.

355
00:33:31,721 --> 00:33:32,600
It was seeking.

356
00:33:32,601 --> 00:33:33,721
And that doesn't mean moving.

357
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:42,920
It can be sniffing, trying to get sniff the eating molecules in the air instead of the enemy molecules in the air.

358
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,320
That's all.

359
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,721
It needs to be seeking.

360
00:33:45,721 --> 00:33:47,640
And okay.

361
00:33:48,681 --> 00:33:49,880
Good, hard questions.

362
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,320
Okay, let me go back to reading this.

363
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,400
I cannot have a remote knowledge of it.

364
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,880
It's a very interesting, weird view here.

365
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,241
It's it as Rick says, you've got to sort of empathize with the the organism to talk about it.

366
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,241
I think that's the point.

367
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:08,000
It but it it's pretty doing science from a third person point of view.

368
00:34:08,081 --> 00:34:18,800
It's just a different kind of science which is recognizing the gestalt, where we're we're treating the rabbit as a rabbit and not as far as not as a bunch of cards stuck together.

369
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,400
Let me just add a footnote quick.

370
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:25,041
Recognizing the gestal as significant to what you're seeking.

371
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:26,560
That's a very important part of it.

372
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,601
That's why it isn't just third person.

373
00:34:29,681 --> 00:34:31,600
You have to have the level of the rabbit, I guess.

374
00:34:31,601 --> 00:34:32,000
That's right.

375
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:41,760
It's the you've got to understand the organism in its active involved seeking what it needs and what is significant.

376
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:47,840
Yeah, right.

377
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:53,841
So let's do all the live stuff we're talking about, so let's go on.

378
00:34:54,081 --> 00:34:58,000
So it isn't the transmission of a movement or the determination of one variable by another.

379
00:34:58,001 --> 00:34:59,680
Well, that's to say the least.

380
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,960
Now comes the harder part.

381
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:10,480
I cannot gain a remote knowledge of it insofar as I guess what it may be, which is by abandoning the body as an object and by going back to the body which I experience at this moment.

382
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,881
See, that's when you're trying to figure out the rabbit by understanding your own body.

383
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:26,721
In the manner, for example, in which my hand, and now we're going to do it from sort of firsthand, my hand moves around the object it touches, anticipating the stimuli and itself tracing out the form which I'm about to perceive.

384
00:35:26,721 --> 00:35:30,880
I cannot understand the function of a living body except by enacting it myself.

385
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,080
Well, that's pretty extreme.

386
00:35:32,081 --> 00:35:33,680
I mean, that's what I thought it said.

387
00:35:33,681 --> 00:35:43,280
That is, any organism, any living organism, if you can't understand it, if you don't think of it as teleological, as weeping, and so forth.

388
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:56,681
That's what the really Cartesian mechanist picture was supposed to get rid of, was the teleology, was building what it meant to the organism and what the organism was seeking into the causal explanation.

389
00:35:56,681 --> 00:36:00,681
That's what that's that's that would be very satisfying.

390
00:36:01,241 --> 00:36:04,760
Yeah, which will I reach that thing's teleology?

391
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:09,960
Oh, I think it's the it's tracing out the form I'm about to perceive.

392
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,161
That's in effect what I'm reaching for when I'm.

393
00:36:14,521 --> 00:36:15,880
Husslow could have said that.

394
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,121
Well, I'm not saying that Husserl did say this.

395
00:36:18,201 --> 00:36:21,721
There'll be too many fronts to discuss on at the same time.

396
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:27,560
We're discussing, I mean, I don't think he thinks that he's got a completely new version of the phenomenon.

397
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:28,760
I don't have to think about that.

398
00:36:29,161 --> 00:36:32,361
This is supposed to be how to do brain science.

399
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:43,481
And you can't do brain science, but do one thing at a time without, in effect, emphasizing, empathizing with the organism the way you do when you are reaching for something.

400
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,960
And remember, when you're reaching for something, it's already there directing your behavior.

401
00:36:47,960 --> 00:37:06,921
In the background of this talk is always don't forget that your hand is at the doorknob as soon as you get up to leave the room, or as soon as you get ready to get your coffee, that your hand is starting to take account of where on the cup the handle is, behind the cup, or in front of the cup, on the right side of the cup, or the left, or maybe it hasn't got a handle.

402
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,760
The activity is ahead of itself.

403
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:17,401
Your body is not sort of waiting to get to the cup to deal with how to take it up.

404
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,000
It's already picking it up.

405
00:37:21,001 --> 00:37:23,401
That's being magically at the door.

406
00:37:23,721 --> 00:37:29,561
And you know that if you think about it, then that's the phenomenology for it.

407
00:37:29,561 --> 00:37:34,081
And moreover, whatever it is that goes on in the brain, you better be able to account for that.

408
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:45,601
And it means you're not just taking in data from the cup and then processing an image of the cup and then adding the fact that it's got good something to drink and then finding where your arm is in objective space.

409
00:37:45,601 --> 00:37:54,161
I'm just telling you the computer, the AI story, and then bringing your arm in objective space over to the cup in objective space.

410
00:37:54,161 --> 00:37:56,800
That's how cognitivism thinks about it.

411
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,400
That has always failed.

412
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,161
Nobody's ever been able to do it.

413
00:38:00,161 --> 00:38:09,601
So in contrast, and close to the organism, as something's holistic, the smarter causality, top down, you're going through it.

414
00:38:10,001 --> 00:38:12,241
I'm just going to form identity.

415
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:18,321
There's a more atomistic conception, bottom-up causation, all linear causation.

416
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:24,721
Can you fully spell out those two pictures without mentioning empathy or teleology?

417
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:25,840
Do you think so?

418
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:26,880
Yeah.

419
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:45,360
He thinks that spelling out the story of how it's already getting set up, getting hot and TV permit attuned because sense organs and also the reaching and stuff is attuned to the object that it's reaching for.

420
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,881
You don't have to bring in first person and teleology to talk that kind of attuned language.

421
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:57,280
But if you take a third-person perspective and since they view that the organism has coupled to its environment in some kind of way.

422
00:38:57,521 --> 00:38:59,121
Well, coupled to its environment.

423
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,000
Yeah.

424
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,280
You're talking about the sensory perspective environment, right?

425
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,960
You know, those passages aren's fascinating to move.

426
00:39:07,201 --> 00:39:07,600
Right.

427
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:19,480
And that means it has to be, attention has to be focused on something, and the eye has to move to look at the something, even if you're not consciously trying to do it.

428
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:29,481
The organism is, and I'm not sure now which way to put it, whether we're disagreeing or not, the organism is moving to get this optimal grip.

429
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:45,800
Isn't that a teleological explanation if you say the only way to explain how that organism is moving is that it has the goal of getting an optimal grip, and only in terms of that goal and what will achieve that goal can you understand what the organism is doing now?

430
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,840
Well, I don't.

431
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,800
It's teleological.

432
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:50,601
I don't see Merloponte saying anything like that in these passages.

433
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,721
Ah, well, it may not be in these passages, although I think it is.

434
00:39:53,721 --> 00:39:54,840
It's certainly in the book.

435
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,000
But why isn't it in these passages?

436
00:39:57,721 --> 00:40:00,201
Okay, let's see if it is by going on.

437
00:40:00,201 --> 00:40:01,720
But keep your eye open.

438
00:40:01,721 --> 00:40:06,840
But I'll bet on this, that if it isn't in these passages, it's a lot of other places.

439
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:16,040
But it'll be in these passages because it'll explain why, for instance, the guy with no leg tries to get up and walk towards the door and so forth.

440
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:23,480
It's going to be because the door is summoning him, and I've talked in like this chapter, to do that.

441
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,360
That's a pretty weird way of talking.

442
00:40:26,681 --> 00:40:28,361
So let's go on with that.

443
00:40:29,241 --> 00:40:30,201
Well, let's see now.

444
00:40:30,201 --> 00:40:31,241
Well, well, well.

445
00:40:31,241 --> 00:40:38,841
Merloponte says it can't be done in the third person, but Merloponte would still talk.

446
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:45,800
So a third-person account, I think Alva summed this up pretty well, and I'll just read it again.

447
00:40:46,681 --> 00:40:52,121
The account he's against is not holistic, but in terms of elements and bottom-up, it's linear.

448
00:40:52,121 --> 00:41:06,400
It's in terms of something in there transmitted to, passively received by the brain, and it doesn't take into account the significance of the input for the organism and how that gets picked up.

449
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:08,001
Those are his objections.

450
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:12,161
Now I've written here about attractors, but I think I said all that just in a second.

451
00:41:12,161 --> 00:41:12,881
Yes.

452
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,120
Okay, so now he says the test case of this is going to be the phantom wheel.

453
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,800
So then he goes on and starts talking about that.

454
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:31,920
That's where he says, well, by the way, you realize, let me just, it's so hard to not tell you where he's off doing saying this isn't the case.

455
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,921
So let me just go on for a second.

456
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:39,760
He wants to say the soul spreads over all the parts and behavior over stills, the central sector.

457
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,120
And this is the kind of thing that Descartes tried to get rid of.

458
00:41:43,121 --> 00:41:44,800
This is back to Aristotle.

459
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,561
It looks like some kind of teleology, that the goal is going to be the only way to explain the behavior, I think.

460
00:41:50,561 --> 00:41:54,960
And it looks like the soul is the form of the body, Aristotle said.

461
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:05,441
It's not the special final stage in the input where it finally gets translated into consciousness and perception.

462
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,481
So the goal is going to spread all over the body.

463
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,081
But now, be careful here.

464
00:42:12,081 --> 00:42:19,521
One might object that this bodily experience is itself a representation, a psychic fact, and so forth.

465
00:42:19,521 --> 00:42:27,280
Now, sometimes he's the one doing the objecting and saying, but, but here, this one is Descartes.

466
00:42:28,081 --> 00:42:30,161
This is not Merlot.

467
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:36,241
One might object that the body experience is a representation, a psychic fact, and that is such as the end of a chain.

468
00:42:36,241 --> 00:42:44,561
You can see that you recognize now it's the same thing as the earlier, of physical and physiological events, which alone can be ascribed to the real body.

469
00:42:44,561 --> 00:42:53,800
It's not my body exact, is not my body exactly as the external body is a body which acts on receptors and finally gives us the consciousness of the body.

470
00:42:54,121 --> 00:42:57,000
And worth reading again and again because that's what we all think.

471
00:42:57,001 --> 00:42:59,160
It's such a pervasive view.

472
00:42:59,161 --> 00:43:13,561
That's why Walter Freeman is either the great genius of the 21st century who will be recognized later or just a kook, which is what practically everybody thinks because his view of this brain story is just utterly different than what we're reading here.

473
00:43:13,561 --> 00:43:21,800
Is there, and now, is there not an inter inferioceptivity just as there is an exteriorceptivity?

474
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:28,921
Cannot I find in the body, this is the body message wires sent from the internal organs to the brain?

475
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:35,481
You know, Descartes discovered what he called the tiny fibers of the optic nerve.

476
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:45,481
And he discovered the nerves going from the stump to the brain and understood that the phantom limb was, because that nerve was still sending impulses and so forth.

477
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,681
This Cartesian picture is brilliant.

478
00:43:48,681 --> 00:43:52,921
And it's just over through the Aristotelian picture completely.

479
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:58,040
So can I find in my body message wires sent by the internal organs to the brain?

480
00:43:58,121 --> 00:44:13,640
Cannot I find, this is all Descartes, which are installed by nature to provide the soul, which is not all over the body but just the crineal gland, with the opportunity of feeling its body, consciousness of the body, and the soul are thus repressed.

481
00:44:13,641 --> 00:44:21,481
The body becomes the highly polished machine in which the ambiguous notion of behavior makes us, nearly makes it forget.

482
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,640
Well, that's, I mean, I hope it helps.

483
00:44:23,641 --> 00:44:28,521
That's the view that you're supposed to try to get yourself free of.

484
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:35,440
And now comes finally the phantom limb example on 88.

485
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,961
What has modern psychology to say to this?

486
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:49,441
Well, what he's going to tell you now, it took me years to unscramble this, and I've only unscrambled it up to the place where I told you to start skipping things because at that point I can't understand it anymore.

487
00:44:50,561 --> 00:44:53,440
But to begin with, it's pretty easy to unscramble.

488
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,800
It's the usual thing.

489
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:03,120
He's going to give us a mentalistic and a mechanistic account of the phantom limb.

490
00:45:03,121 --> 00:45:05,600
And he's going to show you that neither one of them works.

491
00:45:05,601 --> 00:45:08,881
And then he's going to say there has to be some third thing, he says.

492
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,920
And then he's going to give you his intention, his existentialist account of the phantom limb.

493
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,360
That's all you could structure.

494
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,760
You've got to keep in mind, Renaro Ponte.

495
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:22,960
Let's try the mechanical empiricist version.

496
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,881
Just doesn't account for the phenomena, and maybe it's even incoherent.

497
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,840
Let's try the mentalist attempt, the intellectualist, the cognitive account of the phenomena.

498
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,760
It doesn't account for certain things.

499
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,521
It's probably also incoherent.

500
00:45:35,521 --> 00:45:38,721
In this part, he's not worrying about whether they're incoherent.

501
00:45:38,721 --> 00:45:39,921
That was earlier.

502
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,081
That was when he was doing philosophy.

503
00:45:42,081 --> 00:46:01,601
Right now, he just wants to say, if you look at the empirical work on phantom limb, you can see that the mechanistic people only could tell at best half the story, and the mental people another piece of the story, but they can't, none of them can get the whole thing, how it can do all the, how it can have all the funny effects that it does.

504
00:46:01,601 --> 00:46:04,640
So first goes the mechanistic one on 88.

505
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,120
What is modern physiology to say?

506
00:46:07,121 --> 00:46:12,561
Well, it turns out that anesthesia with cocaine does not do away with the phantom limb.

507
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:15,841
And now we've got a problem already.

508
00:46:16,161 --> 00:46:19,960
That would have been the simple mechanistic answer.

509
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:45,160
I mean, if Descartes is right, that the phantom limb is simply that the brain is getting impulses from the nerve that it normally gets when you've got a leg, and it normally represents the body as having a leg because it got those impulses, and it's still getting them, then it's still representing the leg, and you emesociize the nerve, you just numb it, it isn't sending any impulses, why doesn't the leg go away?

510
00:46:45,161 --> 00:46:47,961
That's the first objection to it.

511
00:46:48,280 --> 00:47:11,081
And then we don't understand either why the limb retains the position so that whatever this is, somehow the phantom arm has something to do with where it got stuck, so to speak, and it retains that position.

512
00:47:11,081 --> 00:47:11,800
Why is that?

513
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:20,440
Is it getting, even when, I mean, is it getting from the nerve an account of exactly where it was when it was hit?

514
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,481
Maybe it is.

515
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:26,280
But if it is, then why couldn't you just get rid of it if you got rid of the nerve?

516
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,520
Well, it seems it depends on emotions.

517
00:47:28,521 --> 00:47:31,321
Now he flips over to the mental side.

518
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,241
It depends on psychic determinations.

519
00:47:33,241 --> 00:47:34,440
I'm in the middle of ADA.

520
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:41,480
An emotion, emotion, circumstance which recalls those in which the wound is received, creates a phantom limb in subjects who had none.

521
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,760
Well, boy, there's no simple Cartesian account of that one.

522
00:47:45,081 --> 00:47:47,241
I mean, why is that?

523
00:47:47,241 --> 00:47:51,481
Either, well, either the impulses are coming in from the nerve or they aren't.

524
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,360
And when they are, you've got a limb, and when you don't, you don't.

525
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,480
How do what why would how do you feel about it make any difference?

526
00:47:57,561 --> 00:48:02,681
Oh, well, it looks like there must be some central thing going on, some psychic thing.

527
00:48:02,721 --> 00:48:18,161
And it then it looks like uh you can even have a kind of psycho lo psycho yeah, a a a psychological account, a a psychotherapy kind of one say a psychoanalytical account practically of it.

528
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:28,321
Uh it it turns out that it's the people who refuse to recognize their lack of limb at the bottom of the ADA, whose phantom limb doesn't go away.

529
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:37,920
So he says, must we then conclude that the phantom limb is a memory, a volition, a belief, and failing any physiological explanation provide a psychological one.

530
00:48:38,241 --> 00:48:40,961
Well, that's not going to work either.

531
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,760
And I'll see if I can tell you, I'll go back and read it in a second, but that'll be nice to be able to say it.

532
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:55,601
Oh yeah, cutting the nerve does make the limb go away in some people, at least some of the time.

533
00:48:55,601 --> 00:49:03,441
So then it doesn't look like it's an inner psychological thing, whether they refuse to believe they've lost their limb or not.

534
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,640
You can make it go away.

535
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:06,321
So temporarily.

536
00:49:06,641 --> 00:49:13,201
He says, but no psychological explanation can overlook the fact that the severance of the nerves to the brain abolishes the phantom.

537
00:49:13,521 --> 00:49:15,280
I think he says later it comes back.

538
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:29,681
At least in fact it does, because it would be nice if you could cure these poor people who have the pains in their non-arms and non-legs just by cutting the nerve, but you can't, because I know from reading that it'll come back again.

539
00:49:29,681 --> 00:49:33,921
And so we need much more complicated explanation.

540
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:39,201
And now we're on, let's see, well, time changes the size of it.

541
00:49:39,201 --> 00:49:40,800
That's also an AD3.

542
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,401
That's got to do presumably with the emotional side.

543
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:51,560
But it seems, and then it looks like maybe it's a question of our beliefs about it.

544
00:49:51,561 --> 00:49:53,001
I just read that.

545
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,121
And now comes the part where it gets really important.

546
00:49:56,121 --> 00:49:58,041
How can we put the two together?

547
00:49:58,041 --> 00:50:03,161
We don't seem to be able to figure it out on a mechanistic category or description.

548
00:50:03,161 --> 00:50:04,841
of nerve impulses.

549
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:13,881
We don't seem to be able to figure it out on the psychological description of what one believes and accepts and thinks about whether they've got a limb or not.

550
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:21,401
And then he wants to say, that's a big problem on 89.

551
00:50:21,721 --> 00:50:23,320
What's happening a lot?

552
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:30,441
What has to be understood then is how the psychic determining factors and the physiological conditions veer into each other.

553
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:32,840
This is the third thing he's getting at.

554
00:50:33,161 --> 00:50:36,520
We need a third understanding of being, he says the 2012.

555
00:50:37,081 --> 00:50:45,561
We're not going to do it in terms of the mechanical impulses of the in itself, merely physical.

556
00:50:45,561 --> 00:50:53,800
And we can't do it in terms of the mental content, the intentionality, the belief, which is merely mental.

557
00:50:53,800 --> 00:51:08,200
And not only do we can't get it either way, but we can't get the two together to get it without introducing an entirely different description, which in the light of the discussion Alvin and I just had is a kind of existential teleological description.

558
00:51:08,201 --> 00:51:16,601
It's going to be about how the organism is always set to move around in and deal with the world.

559
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,920
And that's because he hasn't got there yet.

560
00:51:19,081 --> 00:51:25,161
So he says, what has to be understood is how the psychic determining factors and physiological conditions fear into each other.

561
00:51:25,161 --> 00:51:39,681
It's not clear how the imaginary limb is dependent on physiological conditions as a result of third-party causality can be in another context dependent on the pre on the emotions and volitions and so forth of the individual.

562
00:51:40,001 --> 00:51:43,921
And there's no place these two things can come together.

563
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:57,681
Then a little further down, you can't get together the in itself and the cogitationes, that's the mental stuff, the for itself.

564
00:51:57,681 --> 00:52:02,721
A hybrid theory of the phantom limb which finds a place is obscure.

565
00:52:03,201 --> 00:52:05,280
He doesn't think you can make up such a story.

566
00:52:05,681 --> 00:52:10,080
So the phantom limb is not something you can get from objective causality.

567
00:52:10,081 --> 00:52:13,681
That's this linear account.

568
00:52:13,681 --> 00:52:15,520
No more is it a cogi pill.

569
00:52:15,521 --> 00:52:16,641
It could be a mixture.

570
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,441
We could only find a way of putting the two together.

571
00:52:19,601 --> 00:52:21,440
But they have no meaning.

572
00:52:21,521 --> 00:52:34,000
If the third person process and the personal acts can be integrated into a kind can only be put together if the third person processes and the personal acts could be integrated into a common middle term.

573
00:52:34,641 --> 00:52:37,040
There we are, looking for Meroffon.

574
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:45,041
He's got his opening now to put in the missing thing.

575
00:52:45,681 --> 00:52:53,361
And now we get this neat move to the insect, which we go on a lot about in the structure of behavior.

576
00:52:53,360 --> 00:53:02,800
But properly here, when he's talking about the structure of behavior, as he is the bottom of 89 and the top of 90, he tells you the story again that he told there, which is so neat.

577
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,120
I have no idea whether it's true, but it should be true, given his view.

578
00:53:07,121 --> 00:53:20,361
And that is that there's got to be a level of engaged activity and readiness and seeking significance coming from the organism.

579
00:53:21,001 --> 00:53:31,481
And that's more fundamental and sort of, well, it's the global thing that determines what happens in the specific part.

580
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:40,680
And his example of it is that if you suppose if you tie up the leg of an insect, it keeps struggling to get the leg untied.

581
00:53:41,001 --> 00:53:49,641
But if you cut off the leg and it's no more in the body image of the insect, he thinks, then the insect will just use another leg.

582
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:54,920
And that's because what's really important is that the insect is trying to reach for something.

583
00:53:55,001 --> 00:53:56,520
It's a little hard to see it with insects.

584
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:00,040
Pick a little higher up the scale, like lizards or something.

585
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:08,360
When it's trying to grab something, and if you stop it, it'll struggle to get its leg back.

586
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:15,721
But if you just get its leg, one leg out of the system, then the whole thing just readapts and it uses the other leg.

587
00:54:15,721 --> 00:54:22,601
Because what it's really doing is it's doing whatever it can do to get what it wants.

588
00:54:22,601 --> 00:54:29,961
It's trying to get the optimal grip, and it doesn't care whether it's getting the optimal grip with its left leg or its right leg or its mouth.

589
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,921
It will get the optimal grip however way it can.

590
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:53,800
Apparently, I just realized Charles Taylor talks about this in his own way in his book, The Explanation of Behavior, that what the behaviorists didn't take account of is that when an animal presses the lever to get the food, it's not really funny Taylor Taylor translates all this into analytic in that book.

591
00:54:53,800 --> 00:55:05,841
But he says that the behaviorists have to say that the animal gets conditioned to reproduce the same behavior, where behavior has to be a certain motion of the organism.

592
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:13,601
But in fact, the animal doesn't get conditioned to produce a certain behavior because it can reach the knob that gets the food in various ways.

593
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:18,081
If you hamper it with one, it can reach the knob with another, with the other paw.

594
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:19,920
That's not behavior.

595
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,081
That's not movement.

596
00:55:22,081 --> 00:55:24,000
That's comportment.

597
00:55:24,161 --> 00:55:25,760
That's action.

598
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:32,001
The animal has a goal and it goes after it with whatever means it's got.

599
00:55:32,081 --> 00:55:39,681
That's, I mean, Charles Taylor's book helped bring down behaviorists and it would have brought it down completely if Chomsky hadn't in the meantime shot it down.

600
00:55:39,681 --> 00:55:42,641
And it was this kind of argument that did it.

601
00:55:42,641 --> 00:55:44,321
Okay, let's go back to this.

602
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:50,640
We have always, we met elsewhere the case of substitution meant the insect, giving about five lines down.

603
00:55:50,641 --> 00:55:54,721
The insect simply continues to belong to the same world and moving it with all its powers.

604
00:55:54,721 --> 00:55:56,081
That's what I was just saying.

605
00:55:56,081 --> 00:56:01,441
The tied limb isn't replaced by the free one because it continues to carry the insect scheme.

606
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,241
And because the current of activity which flows toward the world still passes through it.

607
00:56:06,241 --> 00:56:09,600
Now, that's just one, I'll show you a lot of it.

608
00:56:09,601 --> 00:56:13,041
There is this constant stuff with these metaphors.

609
00:56:13,041 --> 00:56:20,800
It's not hot, it's hard to know what in the world to take this as, but current of activity.

610
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:35,681
What that means is that somehow the I don't know, the energy in the nerves is already physiologically met to get what the insect wants.

611
00:56:35,681 --> 00:56:43,041
That's what it means to say that there's a current of activity that flows toward the world.

612
00:56:43,681 --> 00:56:48,601
It's it's what is sort of setting up, what do you take?

613
00:56:48,840 --> 00:57:00,841
The current of activity that flows toward the world is a metaphor for whatever it is in the nervous system, which is like that the door is already calling the hand to get the right shape for the doorknob.

614
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:05,081
It's the current of activity, oh no, sorry.

615
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,041
It's the response.

616
00:57:08,041 --> 00:57:18,921
So whatever it is the insect's trying to do, or we're trying to do to open the door, calls forth this kind of activity.

617
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:25,480
And that's, and you have to understand this activity as called forth by the world.

618
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:30,041
And there's all this funny metaphor, the current of activity which flows toward the world.

619
00:57:30,041 --> 00:57:37,721
So he says later somewhere, I think I'll find it when we get there, that there's this current of existence which flows down the nerve.

620
00:57:37,721 --> 00:57:39,080
I mean, talk about weirdness.

621
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:45,640
I mean, it's almost, I mean, trying to get things together that you don't understand how they could be got together.

622
00:57:45,641 --> 00:57:48,681
How can a current of existence flow down a nerve?

623
00:57:48,681 --> 00:58:05,001
Well, what he's trying to say is that the impulses in the nerve are the way they are because it's a response to the solicitation of the object by an organism that's seeking an optimal grip.

624
00:58:05,001 --> 00:58:11,561
And therefore, this nerve current already means this is where I can get a better grip.

625
00:58:12,201 --> 00:58:13,960
We'll see them again and again.

626
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:17,800
It's the optimal grip, as I want to try to show you in the background.

627
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:21,720
There is this instant no more choice than in the case of a drop of oil.

628
00:58:21,721 --> 00:58:39,921
Oh, yeah, now we're going to get this business of tendency toward some kind of optimal, which reduces it to some kind of disequilibrium and produces an equilibrium.

629
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:47,760
I'm saying it in this very abstract way in order to cover oil drops on the one hand and the impact on the other.

630
00:58:48,161 --> 00:59:02,721
But the main sort of level of description he's getting from the Gestaltist is that there is this tendency to some kind of optimal.

631
00:59:03,121 --> 00:59:08,321
For the Gestaltis, it's going to be some least energy organization of the field.

632
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:13,681
Or the animal is going to be getting a grip on what it's seeking.

633
00:59:13,681 --> 00:59:24,001
And that tendency is pulling it to do this, is leading it, or causing, I guess, causing it in this kind of teleological way.

634
00:59:24,001 --> 00:59:43,041
That tendency to get this optimal grip is causing it to do what it does, but away the tendency to lower its energy causes the soap bubble to take the shape of a sphere, even though it hasn't got any conscious goal of wanting to be a sphere.

635
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:48,160
That's not linear causality either, he thinks, the Gestaltist thing.

636
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:53,521
That tendency toward least energy is always teleological.

637
00:59:53,521 --> 01:00:12,321
It's because there is bottom to an attractor, an attractor always is least at the least energy level, that the organism moves toward getting to the bottom of that attractor, which would mean getting rid of the tension, getting whatever it's trying to get.

638
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,520
That's what he's talking about here.

639
01:00:13,521 --> 01:00:15,440
I mean, now he starts with the oil drop.

640
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:21,321
So the oil drop solves, in practical terms, the maximum and minimum problem which confronts it.

641
01:00:21,641 --> 01:00:25,241
It wants to use the least energy, so it gets to be round.

642
01:00:25,241 --> 01:00:31,000
The difference between the drop of oil adapts itself to given external forces.

643
01:00:31,001 --> 01:00:38,921
Oh, yeah, and the oil drop does it in a gravitational field, and it does it because they're the electrical forces between the particles.

644
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:50,040
But the animal does it, which, because it projects the norms of its environment and it projects the norms on its environment.

645
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:55,961
It gives the norms to the environment and lays down the terms of its final problem.

646
01:00:56,280 --> 01:01:05,961
So, whereas the problem for the oil drop is just get the least energy, the problem for the organism is, say, get something to eat.

647
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,640
But then the same thing occurs.

648
01:01:08,121 --> 01:01:13,320
That it hasn't got something to eat, there's a tension that pulls it toward getting something to eat.

649
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:21,480
When a carrot shows up, the carrot says, eaten it, solicits it to go feed it to lower the tension.

650
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:33,961
It's behaving like an oil drop, but its current needs are determining what it will do to lower the tension.

651
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:39,961
Well, so he says, what is found behind the phenomenon of substitution is the impulse of being in the world.

652
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:47,480
Now, the impulse of being in the world is this name in him, is always the name of seeking the maximum grip.

653
01:01:47,800 --> 01:02:06,161
It says that there is always some engaged activity which is involved in some dealing with something whose significance is that it's not as optimal as it could be and who is moving towards an optimal.

654
01:02:03,081 --> 01:02:08,161
That's all built in there.

655
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:16,560
And so there's an open situation, if you drop it down to about 10 lines from the bottom, that requires the animal's movements.

656
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:25,520
So there's always talk about the attractiveness of the carrot causes the animal's movements.

657
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:28,001
That's the teleological way of talking about it.

658
01:02:28,001 --> 01:02:38,081
It's not something in the organism alone that causes it, but it's always going to be understood as what it's needed and needed.

659
01:02:38,801 --> 01:02:45,201
And that's the story of, and it's got to be like completing a gestalt.

660
01:02:45,201 --> 01:02:50,161
So it's like the first notes of a melody require a certain kind of resolution.

661
01:02:50,161 --> 01:02:58,961
That's the talk of requiring, of disequilibrium, of tension, of getting an equilibrium.

662
01:02:58,961 --> 01:03:01,121
That's all both.

663
01:03:01,121 --> 01:03:20,161
I mean, this is important to say, both phenomenological perceptual talk about what it feels like to be an organism, and you can check it in yourself, responding to the door needing to be opened if you're in a room and trying to get out and attract you to do it.

664
01:03:20,161 --> 01:03:30,161
And it's a level in which the brain is supposed to be, if you have a Walter Freeman-like brain story, also described, tension, the basis of attraction, movement, or least energy.

665
01:03:30,161 --> 01:03:32,720
And that's supposed to go over both.

666
01:03:33,041 --> 01:03:39,280
And so it's the, so on 91, about five lines down, the reflexes are never blind processes.

667
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:46,800
They adjust themselves to a direction of the situations, express our orientation toward the behavioral aesthetics.

668
01:03:46,801 --> 01:03:53,161
They trace out from a distance the structure of the object without waiting for its point-to-point stimulation.

669
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:58,280
They do that because it's gone into an attractor landscape, if you talk freeman.

670
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:03,720
It is this global presence of the situation which gives a meaning to the partial stimuli.

671
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:06,921
This is the top-down whole part story.

672
01:04:06,921 --> 01:04:11,880
It causes them to inquire importance, value, and existence for the organism.

673
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:13,720
Now let me read my notes about this.

674
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:16,680
You complete the whole pattern, you lower the tension.

675
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:20,680
And oh yeah, I said, and remember Homer, the arms in Homer.

676
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:26,760
Did I ever say this about the way Homer describes the warriors at a dinner party?

677
01:04:27,161 --> 01:04:27,640
I do.

678
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:27,961
No.

679
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,840
My favorite thing, Homer understood this.

680
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:44,360
And Greek gives him a way of saying it, apparently, in the middle voice, where he says, I did not say this, I said in office hours, that when the warrior, the hungry warriors sat down to dinner, their arms went out to the food in front of them.

681
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:45,800
That's great.

682
01:04:45,801 --> 01:04:47,800
That's pure Marilla-Ponty.

683
01:04:47,801 --> 01:04:51,560
Because he isn't saying as agents, they reached for the food.

684
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:54,041
And he isn't saying that they were just mechanisms.

685
01:04:54,041 --> 01:04:55,081
Their arms went out the way.

686
01:04:55,081 --> 01:04:57,720
If you hit your knee with the thing, your foot goes off.

687
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,480
It wasn't a reflex.

688
01:04:59,961 --> 01:05:08,600
Their body felt the tension to complete the gestalt, which was in their case, being hungry with good food in front of them, grasped the food.

689
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:11,720
And so Homer's just doing phenomenology, doing it right.

690
01:05:12,201 --> 01:05:13,800
But it sounds so weird.

691
01:05:13,801 --> 01:05:18,520
We don't say that unless we're Marillau Ponty or Oil Gibson.

692
01:05:18,761 --> 01:05:20,201
You want to say something, Alex?

693
01:05:20,201 --> 01:05:20,520
Yes.

694
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:21,640
Um okay.

695
01:05:21,961 --> 01:05:24,760
So that's where we are still.

696
01:05:25,081 --> 01:05:50,400
Well, so the the the we're causing them at the top of ninety-two or the the the the he would give them a meaning, they exist as a situation, uh and he goes back to how this is a result of our whole being, an intention of our whole being, our modalities of pre ex pre-objective view, which we call being in the world.

697
01:05:50,400 --> 01:06:03,201
Just being in the world is always this, again, tendency toward optimal grip, which makes it possible for things to solidify you to do things, and then you do them in response to it.

698
01:06:03,201 --> 01:06:05,440
All that goes in in there.

699
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:08,880
But then he says it in these funny ways.

700
01:06:08,881 --> 01:06:10,161
It's about here.

701
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:21,920
He's trying to make a vocabulary in which the in itself and the for itself are actually put together in a third way of being.

702
01:06:21,921 --> 01:06:34,961
And that third way of being is always moving to remove attention and reach an equilibrium, which is an optimal grip for an engaged organism seeking something.

703
01:06:35,041 --> 01:06:36,720
I mean that's all in there.

704
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:42,960
And that's but then he says these weird things about eight lines from the bottom of the paragraph of ninety two.

705
01:06:42,961 --> 01:06:47,201
He says there's a certain energy in the pulsation of existence.

706
01:06:47,201 --> 01:06:49,121
I mean, that's weird talk.

707
01:06:49,121 --> 01:06:52,480
I mean, but it's not physical energy exactly.

708
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,880
I mean, or is it energy in the nerves?

709
01:06:54,881 --> 01:06:56,560
Is it light energy?

710
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:00,081
I mean, I don't think I mean, he doesn't know himself how to describe it.

711
01:07:00,081 --> 01:07:03,360
He wants to say it's not just third person energy.

712
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:06,720
It's not first person agency.

713
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:15,520
And and the pulsation of existence is all is this notion of, again, responding to this tension and lowering it.

714
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,841
And now we're going to go back to the Phantom Limbs there.

715
01:07:17,921 --> 01:07:18,440
Good.

716
01:07:18,081 --> 01:07:23,961
We got away from the, I mean, he's given you the story on the level of movement toward optimal grip.

717
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:26,440
Now he's going to give it to you later.

718
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:27,640
But let me see where I am again.

719
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:29,241
Okay, sure.

720
01:07:29,241 --> 01:07:30,440
I have a mark to read.

721
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:35,081
It is because it is a pre-objective view that being in the world can be distinguished from every, yeah, good.

722
01:07:35,081 --> 01:07:46,760
From every third-person process, from every modality of the race, etc., and from every covito, from every first-person form of knowledge, that it can affect the union of the psychic and the physiological.

723
01:07:46,761 --> 01:07:48,600
Exactly what I tried to say.

724
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:53,560
And that's exactly what I should have read and even wrote down, I think, to read, that didn't.

725
01:07:53,961 --> 01:07:56,680
So let me see where we are here.

726
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:59,161
So how does that help us understand the things I'm wondering about?

727
01:07:59,161 --> 01:08:01,001
Well, yeah, but I'm going to catch up.

728
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:06,440
Okay, we give the new category as being in the world.

729
01:08:06,761 --> 01:08:09,961
It solves the phantom limb problem on 94, I write.

730
01:08:09,961 --> 01:08:12,840
So let's see how that is and why you think we've got it.

731
01:08:14,041 --> 01:08:15,480
94.

732
01:08:15,801 --> 01:08:17,720
Okay, I'm going to read that paragraph.

733
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:25,800
This phenomenon, distorted equally by physiological and psychological explanations, is, however, understood in the perspective of being in the world.

734
01:08:25,801 --> 01:08:26,440
Okay, here we go.

735
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:31,400
We're going to solve the phantom limb problem once we've got this movement toward maximum grip.

736
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:43,000
What is it in us who refuses mutilation and disablement is an I am committed to a certain physical and infrared world, which continues to tend towards its world despite handicaps.

737
01:08:43,001 --> 01:08:44,121
Who continues?

738
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:45,480
I am one.

739
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:53,440
Who continues to tend towards this world despite handicapped with amputations, and who to this extent does not recognize them, they should.

740
01:08:53,480 --> 01:09:07,360
What that means is, just to get the simple phenomenon, that the world, because I am a kind of person who wants to get a maximum grip, say, on cups, cups continue to look reachable to me.

741
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:09,041
It's the intentional art.

742
01:09:03,081 --> 01:09:15,520
I mean, it isn't as if there's a cup and I believe it's reachable, and then I would stop believing it if I didn't have any arm anymore.

743
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:18,320
But suppose neither no arm.

744
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,520
Then the cup isn't reachable anymore.

745
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,800
But I know that.

746
01:09:22,801 --> 01:09:25,201
I can stop believing it's reachable.

747
01:09:25,201 --> 01:09:28,800
The question is, why does it go on looking reachable?

748
01:09:28,801 --> 01:09:35,121
Well, it's because it's I need to reach it.

749
01:09:35,121 --> 01:09:40,161
And it's calling me to reach it because that's how it's done before when I had arms.

750
01:09:40,161 --> 01:09:46,081
And I still have the experience that the cup looks reachable.

751
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:51,041
So if I had arms, I wouldn't reach it, but instead my phantom arm tries to reach it.

752
01:09:51,041 --> 01:09:53,920
It's even clearer with your legs, apparently.

753
01:09:54,801 --> 01:10:12,400
If somebody comes into the door that I like and want to give a hug to or shake hands, but I've lost a leg, then I will just get up and try to walk toward them because they solicit me to do that, because they say hug me, in effect, and I fall over.

754
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:17,600
But why do I try to do it when I know perfectly well I haven't got any legs?

755
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:20,480
Well, because my knowing it isn't what's important.

756
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,081
It's what the world looks like.

757
01:10:22,161 --> 01:10:29,760
I afford walking over and hugging them, and my arm, my body just responds to that.

758
01:10:30,081 --> 01:10:33,280
And then the next move is, I'll try to go faster.

759
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:34,480
Uh-oh, time is up.

760
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,320
Well, I'll just say one more thing, and then I'll stop.

761
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:39,840
And then he says, Well, it's a habit in your body.

762
01:10:39,841 --> 01:10:46,560
It's like, and I'll give the example, when the electricity fails and you keep going and switching the light switches on while you're looking for your flashlight.

763
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:51,480
You know perfectly well that there's no electricity, but your body doesn't know it, it's before it's turning on.

764
01:10:51,801 --> 01:10:58,121
So then he that's the and then he asks the psychological question, well, if it's like a habit, why don't I just find it outgrow it?

765
01:10:58,121 --> 01:10:59,320
And some people do.

766
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:07,880
I mean, after enough light switches don't go on and enough cups can't be reached and you fall over enough when people come into the room, you could learn to stop doing that.

767
01:11:07,881 --> 01:11:09,400
And what would happen if you did?

768
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,480
Cups wouldn't look reachable anymore.

769
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:14,040
People wouldn't look walkable to anymore.

770
01:11:14,041 --> 01:11:18,920
Light switches wouldn't look like they would turn on the light anymore and your friend of wind would go away.

771
01:11:19,001 --> 01:11:21,800
But he wants to know, in some people that doesn't happen.

772
01:11:21,801 --> 01:11:22,680
Why not?

773
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:27,081
Then he has this whole incomprehensible psychoanalytical story about why not.

774
01:11:27,081 --> 01:11:28,520
And I'm not going to go into it.

775
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:32,041
I think I could just say we can go on next time for the next reading.

776
01:11:32,041 --> 01:11:34,921
I'll check and see if I've covered everything I have in cost.
