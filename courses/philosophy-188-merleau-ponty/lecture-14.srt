1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:37,520
Okay, so here so the basic point of the chapter is that normal people have this basically interconnected form of experience in which there is always something that they're dealing with or thinking about, but always on a horizon or a background of a lot of other stuff that they are not dealing with or thinking about, but is somehow available to them and they can develop these horizons in all sorts of directions.

2
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,360
So I made a list of some.

3
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,841
I'm sure there are more, but here's five.

4
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:47,520
Normal people have all these kinds of interconnected experience.

5
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:55,440
They know where the parts of their body are and how to get to them, like squatting mosquito or whatever, throwing your nose.

6
00:00:55,761 --> 00:01:00,401
I'll tell you which of these Schneider has and which he doesn't have and why in a minute.

7
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:07,440
How then two, they know how things are grasped with one sense or one organ, one hand.

8
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,840
I don't know, is there a word that covers hands?

9
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:13,520
You don't grasp with your hand.

10
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:30,280
Anyway, they have a sense of how things are grasped and with one organ, one member of the body, or also with one sense organ and another, so they can see how something good sounds and so we'll talk a lot more about that pretty soon.

11
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:49,001
But already we understand that they can, an organist, for instance, can sit down at an organ in an hour and get a sense of how it's all functioned in a way that he can grasp it, even though the things are in different places and registers are different and so forth.

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:58,840
People have that intersensorial transposability and inter-graspable transposability.

13
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:09,320
And they also have a sense of where things that they normally deal with are, where things that they normally deal with are and how to get to them.

14
00:02:09,321 --> 00:02:21,481
That's important because that extends our body space to new things like the blind man taking up a cane or the musician taking up the organ or any other instrument and so forth.

15
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:39,881
But beyond that, it extends it to our body space extends to all the sorts of things that we know how to get to, so that our finding a way around in the city gets taken over and inhabited by our body space, and our finding our way around in a house and on the campus and so forth.

16
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:46,120
All of these things that we normally deal with become extensions of body space.

17
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:52,441
And we can extend it to new places and new things as we acquire new skills.

18
00:02:53,401 --> 00:03:02,440
And then, in a way that I didn't work out so much, and which he throws in every once in a while, we have the same thing on the level of thoughts.

19
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:15,201
We understand how our ideas are connected, how stories are connected, how conversations are connected, in a way in which, wherever you are in the story, you know what led up to it and what's coming after it roughly.

20
00:03:12,841 --> 00:03:19,521
Where you are in a conversation, you're able to remember where you came from and where you're going.

21
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:21,921
And remember isn't even the right word.

22
00:03:21,921 --> 00:03:42,880
The conversation just feels like it's already bringing with it the past meaning as part of the current meaning of what's being talked about, and it's setting up a future meaning, which isn't something you have to think about and project any more than you'd have to think about the back of the house as a future experience when you're looking at the front.

23
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:44,320
Keep that in mind always.

24
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,360
The back of the house is already on the horizon of the front.

25
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,721
The front looks like it looks the way it does because it has the back.

26
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:58,721
And the conversation is going the way it is because it came from someplace, it's going someplace.

27
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:00,961
So that's number four.

28
00:04:00,961 --> 00:04:09,281
Number five, very abstractly too, we have the notion of numbers and that they are functionally related in terms of their meaning.

29
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:15,841
So you get this funny example about plus and minus five, five plus four minus five.

30
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,161
Schneider has to figure out that that is four.

31
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:23,201
Whereas we just look at it and think, well, the fives cancel out.

32
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,080
He adds it up and gets nine, and then he subtracts five.

33
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,081
Ah, well, you know, it's four.

34
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:38,881
I'm interested in that because in the days when I thought about computers and artificial intelligence, there was a logic program that was considered very good.

35
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:47,921
It was considered by people like Muell and Simon who were thinking that they were doing some kind of cognitive psychology to be thinking like we think.

36
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:51,441
And I looked at it and I discovered that what it had was things like that.

37
00:04:51,560 --> 00:05:01,881
It would say it would do logic sort of this and then that too, and then he takes that right back again in some way, and then it has to figure all that out.

38
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:07,161
It can't just be that, I don't know, greater than and less than cancel each other out.

39
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:08,200
I can give you an example.

40
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,041
It was even simpler than that.

41
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,841
Yes, or I don't know.

42
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:17,320
Now, if I go back and look at my notes, they're very simple logical functions.

43
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,880
It's like adding five and subtracting five.

44
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:27,081
The computer had to go through the steps, even though you could see immediately that one of these things canceled out the other.

45
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:30,281
So, but we don't see it there.

46
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:32,601
And now those are the five.

47
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:46,120
And we all get better and better at doing this sort of thing by acquiring new bodily and mental skills that extend the range of our ability and our ability to get around.

48
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,601
By the way, I have to say it someplace, and I feel so strongly about it, but I'd better say it now before I forget.

49
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:57,320
When I say skills, you don't find the word skill in here ever.

50
00:05:57,881 --> 00:06:00,761
And it's not the translator's fault exactly.

51
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:03,800
The French don't seem to have a good word for skill.

52
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,041
So maybe Olivia can help us.

53
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:10,041
The word is what Adidas, I think, gets translated habit here.

54
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,880
Habit's the wrong word.

55
00:06:11,881 --> 00:06:17,560
Habits he, absolutely, that may be what it means in French, but it can't be what narrow continu means.

56
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:29,721
We say habits are rigid, sort of meaningless, context-independent something or others, like flickering the light switch when you go in the room whether the electricity has failed or not.

57
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:41,240
And this example of a habit on 165, which is the first place I found where the word comes in, is forming the habit of dancing.

58
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,721
Well, think about that.

59
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:44,161
Dancing isn't a habit.

60
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:50,481
You may have the habit of going dancing at six o'clock every Saturday or something, a routine and boring habit.

61
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:52,721
But dancing is a skill.

62
00:06:52,961 --> 00:06:56,721
It's not like brushing your teeth, which even that is going to be a skill.

63
00:06:57,841 --> 00:07:01,201
And it's crucial to everything that La Ponte says.

64
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,201
It is never means habit.

65
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,281
He always needs to.

66
00:07:05,281 --> 00:07:22,161
And if you understand what happened in French or in English or in the translation that made this peculiar bad mood, I was going to say, the one place where he really needs a habit is a footnote to Berickson.

67
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:25,440
So you should mention that, but how could that ruin the whole chapter?

68
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,320
And here he is at the bottom, 165.

69
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:36,160
So then it means inactivity.

70
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,760
I see for Berkson too.

71
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:46,880
Well, the footnote on 165, he says, is Berickson, for example, thinks when he defines habit as the fossilized residue of a spiritual activity.

72
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,080
Now, that is a habit.

73
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,681
That's the light switch thing.

74
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,760
You once knew what it meant, but now the arm just goes up in a meaningless way.

75
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,761
But it is itself the congenital existence as well.

76
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:09,761
It is, I'll tell you, that when he's talking about acquiring new something or others, he's not acquiring new fossilized residues of spiritual activity.

77
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:10,721
Yeah.

78
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:13,041
Yeah.

79
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:15,521
Yeah.

80
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,481
All that.

81
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,680
That's what skills are.

82
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:25,921
You acquire a new skill, it's present, you can call on it any time, but it's adaptable, you can improve it, and uh yeah so forth.

83
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:36,681
It doesn't mean that you're just well I think I I mean all all I understand talking to you is that habit just doesn't mean the same thing to somebody in French as it does to to me.

84
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,840
I don't know whether there's something wrong with me or not.

85
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:44,921
Habit has got to be for us sort of routine, meaningless kind of activity.

86
00:08:44,921 --> 00:08:52,120
We've got a word for what you can acquire, what gets sedimented in the body, what you can make richer and richer.

87
00:08:52,121 --> 00:08:53,481
That's skill.

88
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,200
Now I suspect the French must have one word for this.

89
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,441
Yeah.

90
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:00,041
I did with my life switch story, but let me give you another.

91
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:03,800
You could have the habit of dancing to talk like him, but that wouldn't be.

92
00:09:03,881 --> 00:09:04,760
I mean, make no sense.

93
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:10,041
Trying to explain to somebody who's taken up ballroom dancing that they've now acquired the habit of dancing.

94
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,161
That's ridiculous.

95
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:12,601
They've acquired the skill.

96
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:20,281
What the habit would be, just to give you an example, is you get boringly into the routine of going dancing every Saturday at nine.

97
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:21,560
That's a habit.

98
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,481
And you can acquire that too.

99
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,441
But it's different.

100
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,960
So a better example of that has nothing to do with skill and table.

101
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,840
I have the habit of reading for low finding people or going to sleep.

102
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,401
Yeah, yeah.

103
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,361
That's not a skill.

104
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:33,320
That's not a skill.

105
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,321
Nobody could say that that's a skill.

106
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:41,721
And and it's if you don't see the distinction between habit and skill, all this stuff toward the end.

107
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:51,800
From where that leaves talks about the habit of dancing and then he talks about the habit of the blind man using the sick and so forth and so forth, that's always skill.

108
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,481
These are m motor habits he talks about at the at one seventy five.

109
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,641
Those are motor skills of everywhere.

110
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,281
Yeah.

111
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,121
That's where we're that's where I'm reading this very minute, yeah.

112
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,041
Yes, that's right.

113
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,560
Every but that's not a habit.

114
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,601
That's a skill.

115
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,481
The habit of going dancing on Saturday night doesn't reside between perception and motion.

116
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,800
But that but the skill of dancing just resides between perception and motion.

117
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,960
Sure, habits all over these places.

118
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,561
It's all he says you've been analyzing motor habits.

119
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,240
And he says, and then he goes into the blind man and his stick.

120
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:46,161
The blind man might have a habit, just I keep repeating myself, that it's so important.

121
00:10:46,161 --> 00:10:50,401
You just won't get it if you don't understand that this doesn't mean habit.

122
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:59,041
The blind man doesn't acquire the habit of using his stick when he goes out in the sense of a routine thinking that he would use it no matter what.

123
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:06,401
He acquires a skill of using his stick, meaning that he uses it to feel late at the end of it, and perception and action are tied together.

124
00:11:06,401 --> 00:11:07,521
Why do you exist this?

125
00:11:07,761 --> 00:11:08,640
I don't understand.

126
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:10,081
We've got a good word for this.

127
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,800
It's called skill in English.

128
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,881
Why not he's using this word?

129
00:11:15,281 --> 00:11:17,761
Well, yeah, that I think is a question about the French.

130
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:18,481
What's the word in French?

131
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:18,961
I think you say.

132
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:20,560
Habito.

133
00:11:20,641 --> 00:11:21,521
Oh, well, that's even worse.

134
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,681
Actually, it means feel more.

135
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,401
Is in French?

136
00:11:26,641 --> 00:11:28,320
No, but now what the heck is that?

137
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,041
Yes, it means skill.

138
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,521
And our translator should have said skill.

139
00:11:33,521 --> 00:11:35,841
Because habit means something else.

140
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,761
And habits in French, when I hear it, is more close to this routine or infinity.

141
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,281
Is it?

142
00:11:43,281 --> 00:11:48,480
Okay, well, however, well j i it's so important that you should really go through in the book.

143
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:55,761
And I hope you're doing this because it makes a big difference to your understanding if the words go against your intuitions at every turn.

144
00:11:55,761 --> 00:12:00,121
You should have written body schema everywhere where it says body image.

145
00:11:57,841 --> 00:12:04,041
But you could finally sort of get away without that, I think, after a while.

146
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:14,841
That you just can't get away without canceling every time he talks about habit and putting in skill, or you just won't have any kind of intuition at all of what he's talking about.

147
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,680
Did you notice the funny place?

148
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:19,000
It might be interesting to look at the French.

149
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:25,721
But one place all of a sudden the translator is if he woke up, translates body schema by body schema.

150
00:12:25,881 --> 00:12:27,161
I don't know what to make of that.

151
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:28,840
Then he goes right back to image again.

152
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:37,480
I don't know if you had a lot of coffee or something, but at the bottom of 164, the acquisition of a habit, that's already wrong.

153
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:44,440
The acquisition of a skill, that sentence demonstrates anything, as a rearrangement and renewal of the corporal schema.

154
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,641
That's amazing.

155
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:49,800
Presents great difficulties for traditional philosophers and so forth.

156
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,361
Okay.

157
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,800
That that's yep.

158
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,441
I know I'm not saying more.

159
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,241
If you can say it anyway.

160
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:57,881
Well, just a just a conceptual point.

161
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:10,201
In English, you know, it also and this now is going to happen to what does it start overlapping.

162
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:20,521
So it's not an entirely just translation is a well, I I mean I I'm not going to discuss it about, but I'll say one thing.

163
00:13:20,521 --> 00:13:27,641
I think the fact that the disposition is overlaps both of them in some way doesn't convince me that habit and skill overlap at all.

164
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:30,841
I think they are totally separate from any to them.

165
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,840
The thought rate of eye, but I'm just challenged.

166
00:13:32,841 --> 00:13:40,680
Think of an example of where something can is a wig where you can't tell whether we're talking about a habit or a skill.

167
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,921
I think in each case, think that's a skill.

168
00:13:43,921 --> 00:13:45,441
I mean, do I have the habit of speaking?

169
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:52,480
I might have a habit of speaking, and you know, every time, I don't know, when the parrot comes into the room, I say something to it.

170
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,481
But the parrot may have a habit of speaking.

171
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:56,881
Linguistic patterns are habitual.

172
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,321
My linguistic practices are not habitual, I don't think.

173
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,241
I don't, it's up to you what you think about it.

174
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,560
I mean, my sense of that is my linguistic practices are a skill I've acquired.

175
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,481
But anyway, don't worry about it.

176
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,321
If there is some area where they may overlap, there's huge areas where they don't.

177
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,601
And Merlo-Ponty is writing about areas where they don't.

178
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:24,001
He's talking about motor skills you can acquire quite easy and skick, quite dancing, like finding your way around in your house, like whatever.

179
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:33,121
Okay, I had to put that aside in somewhere, because I think it's really important not to get confused by the translation.

180
00:14:33,121 --> 00:14:34,320
Okay, now let's see.

181
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,641
So we can get better and better at acquiring new bodily and mental skills.

182
00:14:38,641 --> 00:14:40,241
I thought I said no problem.

183
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:44,081
Now, just in your wrist, neither can do the first three.

184
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,201
He can know what his body is when he sweats a mosquito.

185
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,201
He can know he can grasp something with one hand or the other.

186
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:58,961
He can know where things normally are and how to get to them, like his own house.

187
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:05,041
What he can't do is take over new situations.

188
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:15,041
He can't enrich his world by learning new habits so that new things show up for him as something he can find and do.

189
00:15:15,361 --> 00:15:17,761
This is on 155.

190
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,041
At the bottom.

191
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:37,561
Just as he, about eight lines in the bottom, just as he means by means of preparatory movements to be able to take a grip on his own body before performing movement, before performing movements when they're not mapped out ahead in a familiar situation.

192
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:48,200
Well, I'm trying to say somewhere that he couldn't acquire a new habit, but I don't think I'd want to go.

193
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,281
I think he can.

194
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:52,201
Maybe if he's a finished bad sentence, let me try.

195
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:58,521
Just as he needs by means of preparatory movements to be able to take a grip on his own body before performing movements.

196
00:15:58,921 --> 00:16:01,320
When they're not mapped out in a familiar situation, yeah.

197
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:06,521
I mean, whenever he's in a new situation, this is only half of what I wanted your sentence to say.

198
00:16:06,521 --> 00:16:13,481
But when he's in a new situation, we can just already convert into doing something that we haven't done before.

199
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,161
We can find our way to a new house, for instance, right off.

200
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,601
He can't do that.

201
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:30,680
He has to turn it all into completely kind of computer-like mental rule before he can learn it.

202
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,721
And he never turns it.

203
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,320
It never turns into a habit, I think, but that doesn't say that.

204
00:16:35,321 --> 00:16:39,240
I mean, I think he's stuck with the familiar situations he's got.

205
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,321
New situations don't become.

206
00:16:41,321 --> 00:16:42,200
But I'm not sure.

207
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,641
And nothing depends on it.

208
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:45,641
So I just thought it was that way.

209
00:16:45,641 --> 00:16:46,921
I'll write a question mark here.

210
00:16:46,921 --> 00:16:51,000
If anybody finds evidence how this is, let me know.

211
00:16:51,321 --> 00:17:02,121
Okay, now, but the important thing is that he could do the first three, but he can't do the last ones, it seems.

212
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:09,161
That is, he can't understand numbers.

213
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,441
We did that as an example.

214
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,641
He can't understand stories.

215
00:17:11,641 --> 00:17:13,200
He can't understand conversations.

216
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,921
He can't understand metaphors and so forth.

217
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:18,241
Those are all, those aren't body things.

218
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:21,200
Those are not sensory motor things.

219
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:37,600
And though he's got this sort of diminished sensory motor world, he's got an even more diminished sort of intellectual world where he's just like a computer who can only do these things, calculating together meaningless squiggle.

220
00:17:37,841 --> 00:17:47,361
He knows what to do with the squiggle five and the squiggle four and the squiggle five and plus and minus, and he knows that when he can do those things, lo and behold, it comes out four.

221
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:53,200
But he doesn't know why or what that means or how to adapt it to other situations.

222
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,641
Okay, that's basic point of chapter.

223
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:58,161
That was the first thing.

224
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:10,401
Okay, we do the above things and to incorporate new meanings in new situations because we can see the meaning or significance of our movements and of our ideas.

225
00:18:10,401 --> 00:18:18,240
Now, there's some way in which he lacks seeing the meaning or the significance of his movements and his thoughts.

226
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:24,960
Now, the more important thing is to skip him for a while and now follow out what Meryl Parni thinks we can do.

227
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,761
So our actions and our ideas call up other actions and ideas.

228
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,680
That's this horizon story.

229
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,840
I'm going to give you a bunch of pages what he's saying because I think it's important.

230
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:45,361
On 151, bottom, whereas in the patient, the meaning has to be brought in from elsewhere by an act of interpretation.

231
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:54,081
Conversely, in a normal person, the subject's intentions are immediately reflected in a perceptual field, polarizing it, and so forth and so forth.

232
00:18:54,081 --> 00:18:56,240
A wave of significance.

233
00:18:56,801 --> 00:19:01,401
Effortlessly setting up a wave of significance and so forth.

234
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:06,040
So in the patient, the perceptual field has lost its plasticity.

235
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,000
That's lost its horizons.

236
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,000
He says that lots of times.

237
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:19,001
The Bible 152, the translation of percept into movement is affected by the express means of language.

238
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,600
That's denial.

239
00:19:20,601 --> 00:19:22,280
You have to think it out.

240
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:32,360
Whereas the normal subject penetrates into the object by perception, assimilating structure into instructions, and through his body, the object directly regulates his movements.

241
00:19:32,361 --> 00:19:39,081
Now, the blind man's pain is a good extreme example of that, where you penetrate into the object and so forth.

242
00:19:39,081 --> 00:19:40,520
But anything will do.

243
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:50,921
When you get to understand your coffee cup, then you've got one of these kinds of grips on it, and the coffee cup can regulate your movements.

244
00:19:50,921 --> 00:19:56,680
That is, when you get ready to have coffee, the coffee cup can solicit your hand to go in the right place, in the right shape.

245
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,961
And if the handle happens to be hidden behind, it doesn't matter.

246
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,080
But your body knows the handle is there and just where it is and goes there.

247
00:20:05,081 --> 00:20:12,360
But not magically in the sense that you knew that before you ever encountered your coffee cup.

248
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:20,200
But magically in Merlot-Fanti's sense, and you don't have to think that it's your coffee cup and it has a handle and the handle is on the back.

249
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,960
And when all that interpretation and thinking is done, then you could just, then you reach for it.

250
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:36,041
It's magically in the sense that in your world, once you've acquired the skill of drinking from your coffee cup, it all just happens automatically, spontaneously.

251
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,521
Maybe automatic if you have it routinely.

252
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,881
It happens spontaneously.

253
00:20:41,881 --> 00:20:45,041
It could become automatic, but then it would, never mind.

254
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,240
It would have to be real rigid, and you would have to have the tough.

255
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:50,080
I think I couldn't tell you this.

256
00:20:50,081 --> 00:20:53,601
This will sink back into a previous discussion I don't want to go into.

257
00:20:53,601 --> 00:20:55,360
So 165.

258
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,760
Just collecting the quotes that are important.

259
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,401
Here's the blind man's stick at the bottom.

260
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:12,480
It's not an object for him, and its point becomes the area sensitive to them, the scope and radius and so forth, are all just taken up in here in his activity.

261
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,161
They've gone, as Meriloponchi sometimes says, I couldn't find it.

262
00:21:17,121 --> 00:21:19,360
They get on the side of the object.

263
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,521
Sorry, they're on the side of the subject.

264
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,440
Maybe that's a bad way of talking.

265
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,480
Maybe he doesn't say it.

266
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,680
Maybe I just said it.

267
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,720
Because I don't want to call us a subject for him.

268
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,561
They are taken over by the body.

269
00:21:30,561 --> 00:21:31,521
That's what he says.

270
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,680
And become part of the body space and become our access to the world with pain.

271
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:45,440
Or just become the layout of the world that we inhabit, to use his terms, learn to get around in a city and so forth.

272
00:21:45,760 --> 00:22:01,760
So on 166, he's talking about, he's still kind of getting to see because in a movie, there's no quick comparison, he says, I like this, on 166, between the object's length and the stick.

273
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,401
And so the blind man doesn't have to do that.

274
00:22:04,401 --> 00:22:18,401
Doesn't mean Merilopanchi kind of have to pass through the objective world, doesn't have to know where the object is in the objective world, where the stick is in the objective world, and what the stick therefore tells him about the object.

275
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:20,161
That is all gone.

276
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:22,080
He did have to start there.

277
00:22:22,081 --> 00:22:24,320
Again, it's not magical.

278
00:22:24,321 --> 00:22:28,601
He doesn't know, the blind man doesn't automatically have the stick, but he has to get it.

279
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,561
And when he gets it, then he doesn't have to think about it consciously.

280
00:22:33,881 --> 00:22:36,440
He doesn't have to think about it unconsciously.

281
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,121
He doesn't even have to process it in a certain sense.

282
00:22:40,121 --> 00:22:43,480
I mean, according to Nero Ponti, and it's really important.

283
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:54,680
The blind man does not have a bunch of, well, when the blind man starts with the stick, he has these thumping rubbers in the palm of his hand, or bumps, because he bumps along.

284
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,881
And he interprets that.

285
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,401
Remember the word interprets.

286
00:22:57,401 --> 00:22:59,881
This is what he does when he hasn't got the skill.

287
00:22:59,881 --> 00:23:04,600
He interprets the bumps in the palm of his hand as meaning there's a curve there.

288
00:23:04,601 --> 00:23:17,000
That's what it is not to inhabit, not to bring it into your body, not to make it part of the horizons of your coping world.

289
00:23:17,321 --> 00:23:22,280
But after a while, and this is the crucial thing, the bumps go away.

290
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,240
Now it's very important how you understand that.

291
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:38,520
If you think the bumps are still there in the palm of your hand and you feel them, and you interpret them, but it's all unconscious now and very fast, then you are getting it wrong, according to Baroque.

292
00:23:39,801 --> 00:23:41,401
Anybody know Polanyi anymore?

293
00:23:41,401 --> 00:23:46,921
The person who gets this sort of brilliantly wrong is Michael Polanyi in his book, The Tacit Dimension.

294
00:23:46,921 --> 00:23:59,721
He does the cane story, and he says that at first you have to focus on the bumps in the palm of your hand, but later instead of being distal, that is the object of your attention, they become proximal.

295
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,280
They become so close to you that you don't really notice them anymore.

296
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,041
But I notice how I'm putting that.

297
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,240
They're still there.

298
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:15,440
You're still getting the not just the information about the pain, the pain in the palm of your hand, because you have to get that information.

299
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:18,321
But it's not coming to you perceptually anymore.

300
00:24:18,641 --> 00:24:27,280
It's being processed outside of your mind altogether, according to the phenomenology of it, according to Merloponte.

301
00:24:27,361 --> 00:24:28,960
We'll come back to this later.

302
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:40,560
But the important thing he wants to stress is you are not interpreting, you do not have a rule, he says this too, that relates the bumps in the palm of your hand to where the stick is.

303
00:24:40,561 --> 00:24:49,680
When you've got the habit on the side of the body, the phenomena is that the stick has become part of you, it's transparent, you don't feel anything in the palm of your hand.

304
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,560
What you feel when you use the stick is the curve.

305
00:24:52,561 --> 00:24:54,641
He says that it's with it.

306
00:24:55,601 --> 00:24:57,840
But in fact, I've got a turn to it.

307
00:24:58,641 --> 00:25:00,321
We've gone about this a long time.

308
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:05,760
Here we are on page 176, about 20 lines down.

309
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,360
Well, no, it's probably eight lines down.

310
00:25:07,361 --> 00:25:20,240
It would appear in this case that the perception is always a reading off in the sensory data, that is the twitches in the palm of the hand, but constantly accelerating, operating ever with ever more attenuated signal.

311
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,360
That is sort of clearly an outer consciousness.

312
00:25:23,361 --> 00:25:41,200
But habit does not consist in interpreting the pressures of the stick on the hand as an indication of certain habit again, here, of course, the skill of using the stick does not consist in interpreting the pressures of the stick on the hand as indications of certain positions of the stick, and these are signs of external objects.

313
00:25:41,361 --> 00:25:44,161
It could relieve us of the necessity of doing so.

314
00:25:44,161 --> 00:25:48,401
Now, you can still say, ah, but it's all going on unconsciously.

315
00:25:48,440 --> 00:26:00,041
And all I think Merlot Fung Chi would say in response to that is, well, the burden of proof is on you to say that, but the nominology is that the stick is now just a part of my body.

316
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:11,560
And I don't have to, just as I don't have to understand the pressure on the palms on my feet to know how the floor is going, I don't have to understand the pressure on my hand to know how the curve is going.

317
00:26:11,561 --> 00:26:13,161
So let's go on with that.

318
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,200
The pressures on the hand and the stick are no longer given.

319
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,401
That's the crucial line.

320
00:26:19,401 --> 00:26:21,240
They are no longer perceived.

321
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:26,361
The stick is no longer an object perceived by the blind man, but an instrument with which he perceives.

322
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:29,161
It's the bodily auxiliary and so forth.

323
00:26:29,161 --> 00:26:43,000
But the real object is not to give emphasized objection and invariant or set of perspectives, but something towards which the stick leads perspectives, which, according to perceptual experience, are not signs but aspects.

324
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,361
That's another way to put it.

325
00:26:44,361 --> 00:26:46,440
Signs are what you have to interpret.

326
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:57,240
They're the perceptual given, which supposedly, and I think, well, which correctly says you have to be interpreted when you start to learn the stick.

327
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:03,000
But they stop being common and you stop interpreting when you get it stick.

328
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,320
Again, so they're not, it's now, what's the wrong view then?

329
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:10,040
It's called intellectualism, of course.

330
00:27:10,601 --> 00:27:25,800
And intellectualism takes the world of, takes up these elements of impression and then interprets them by somehow, well, it could be that you did it by association, but that's such a looser view that it's dropped out by now.

331
00:27:26,121 --> 00:27:28,280
We don't even hear about empiricism anymore.

332
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:44,801
But you still hear about the guy who thinks that there is an interpretation, a cognitive intention, in which the sensory data are grasped and put together by an intelligible core.

333
00:27:44,801 --> 00:27:45,520
You see that?

334
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:47,600
He uses a word for that as concept.

335
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,320
For Husserl, who has this wrong view, according to Naro-Fonty, the word is no emo.

336
00:27:54,561 --> 00:28:02,960
And the idea is that you've got some kind of rule in your mind or law which enables you to put these things together.

337
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,720
Let's go on.

338
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,761
Sodi.

339
00:28:06,081 --> 00:28:12,320
It's a reference to Husserl, where he says they're taken up and put together by an intelligible core.

340
00:28:12,321 --> 00:28:18,161
At this point, he's admitting that at least this stage of Husserl, he's admitted to the Hussar of an intellectual.

341
00:28:18,161 --> 00:28:25,200
But this analysis distorts the sign and the meaning because it separates out by a process of objectification.

342
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,960
That's the place you should.

343
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,561
That's the prejudice of the world.

344
00:28:28,561 --> 00:28:35,280
It has turned the stuff in the palm of your hand into objects, which you have to relate to the curve out there, which is an object.

345
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:43,601
So it's done, the sensations, which were pregnant with meaning, and the invariable core is not a law, but a thing.

346
00:28:43,601 --> 00:28:44,480
What does that mean?

347
00:28:45,121 --> 00:28:51,360
The sense content, which is already pregnant with demon, and the invariant core, is not a law.

348
00:28:52,081 --> 00:28:54,401
Well, what's kind of tendencies here?

349
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:57,921
But this analysis distorts both the sign and the meaning.

350
00:28:57,921 --> 00:28:58,960
We got that.

351
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:08,080
That sign being the twitch is misunderstood, and the meaning being some intellectual thing you bring to it, which is a misentive thing.

352
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:22,881
It separates out by a process of objectification of both the sense content, which is already pregnant with meaning, Narrow-Ponty says, but not the world of prejudice, and the invariant core, which is not a law, but a thing.

353
00:29:22,881 --> 00:29:23,680
Ah, of course.

354
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,800
The law was being the rule, the concept, for putting it all together.

355
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,801
But there is no such invariant core.

356
00:29:29,881 --> 00:29:37,480
That is just the curve or whatever it is that you're feeling at this point.

357
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:46,841
He feels the architecture between subject and world, active transcendental consciousness, the manner which carries it into the thing, intro world, that means that it's organs.

358
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:48,121
Okay.

359
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,080
Yeah.

360
00:29:49,641 --> 00:29:53,241
So that's the first thing I wanted to say about horizons.

361
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,040
Where are we?

362
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:54,680
Yeah.

363
00:29:55,081 --> 00:29:57,000
That should be a trouble you study.

364
00:29:57,161 --> 00:29:58,440
No, it's only quote.

365
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,561
Which, but which one?

366
00:29:59,641 --> 00:30:01,961
Because he goes back to the crazy.

367
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,080
Ah, things is true.

368
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,720
Ah, between.

369
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:04,840
Well, yes, I don't like that.

370
00:30:04,841 --> 00:30:05,401
You're right.

371
00:30:05,401 --> 00:30:07,641
Between subject and world, I didn't like.

372
00:30:07,641 --> 00:30:09,720
Subject, I don't think it's the right thing to say.

373
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,801
Transcendent of consciousness, I don't like.

374
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,601
You're right.

375
00:30:12,601 --> 00:30:14,040
That troubles me too.

376
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,961
I don't know why he wants to say that.

377
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,241
Yeah, that's right.

378
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,121
He shouldn't say that.

379
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,641
It troubles me.

380
00:30:21,641 --> 00:30:28,360
Except that I got sort of like 30 lines on my side, and you've got one line on your side.

381
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,200
Otherwise, there's a problem.

382
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,521
The other line should 30 lines should trouble you.

383
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,360
We have to talk about that.

384
00:30:34,361 --> 00:30:36,281
Okay, where are we?

385
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,600
176.

386
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,280
Let's see.

387
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,761
I just call up other actions and ideas.

388
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,960
Is that lying?

389
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,360
I don't know where I got off to this.

390
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,720
Yeah, okay, I did 171.

391
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,520
Then I did 165.

392
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:56,600
Yeah, there's a blind man slipping 166.

393
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,280
157.

394
00:30:59,321 --> 00:31:00,440
Yeah, okay.

395
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:12,720
So Merrill-Ponte calls the movement side of this flexible adaptability where you stop having signs and interpreting them and just become open to the world.

396
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,161
That's motility.

397
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,760
That's what the chapter is about.

398
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:26,720
He uses the word motility, not all that much, though I thought I would point out, having said what goes on, that he calls it motility, the bottom of 158.

399
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:33,280
These move today should enable us to clearly understand motility as the basic intentionality.

400
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:38,000
Consciousness, aha, this is going to make Alva happy, but it doesn't make me unhappy.

401
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,641
You can see that.

402
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,720
At the top of 159, consciousness is in the first place not a matter of I think, but I can.

403
00:31:45,121 --> 00:31:46,161
Exactly.

404
00:31:46,161 --> 00:31:47,760
He never should say that.

405
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,361
That's a Husserl phrase.

406
00:31:49,361 --> 00:32:00,480
He can't mean that, because on 167 or 161, 161, he's talking about what he should say, starting on 160.

407
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,000
A movement is learned when the body is understood, that is, when it is incorporated into its world.

408
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,280
To move one's body is to aim things through it.

409
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,240
That sounds like an I can, but goes on.

410
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,280
It is to allow oneself to respond to their call.

411
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,720
That's the right thing to say.

412
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,321
That's the Gestalt thing.

413
00:32:18,321 --> 00:32:23,280
Yet it isn't I can do, it's that it draws me to do.

414
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,161
And it isn't drawing me in the sense of an I.

415
00:32:26,161 --> 00:32:29,280
It's drawing the corporal schema, the one in me.

416
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,200
Remember, one experiences things.

417
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,000
There is a, and Heidegger talked about Mon side of the body.

418
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:40,080
It's one who perceives in me, not I.

419
00:32:40,401 --> 00:32:47,921
And what it does is not put a aim on things, but be open to the call of things.

420
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:58,680
And uh I was just thinking, oh, yeah, I and I put on reserve uh a book called Ways of the Hand by uh David Sudnow, Learning to be a jazz musician.

421
00:32:58,841 --> 00:33:07,480
And by the end of the book, I mentioned it, but I put it on reserve, he's very clear, thanks to me, I must say, because I had the manuscript, that he talked like Husserl.

422
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:13,240
He said, by the end of the book, my I know jazz and I reach for the right notes.

423
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,280
And I said, Why?

424
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,001
You're calling the book Ways of the Hand.

425
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,200
Why do you think that?

426
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:24,520
So you'll see that the end of the book is rewritten, in which he says, My hand knows jazz and reaches for the right notes.

427
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,040
That's the right thing to say.

428
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:31,720
Now, his hand is, in fact, he should say, I don't remember how far I've even into this, drawn to the right notes.

429
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,840
And that's very important.

430
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,480
It's just a, this is the sunny relation he has to Husserl.

431
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,361
And just when he shouldn't be taking up Husserl, he does for a minute.

432
00:33:42,761 --> 00:33:48,041
It seems like he can keep the phrase, I can, so long as the I means by his human.

433
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,240
And I send them.

434
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:58,841
Well, and the can should, as long as we're clear that that's, and oh, I can respond, or I can be called, yeah, is this ultra.

435
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:00,841
Right, it is.

436
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:13,241
That's what I think if he did, as long as he changes the meaning it has for, for I think, for Usero, at least the meaning it has in ordinary English, to say I can is much too individual and much too active.

437
00:34:13,241 --> 00:34:17,881
Well, you want it to be at least equally impersonal and passive.

438
00:34:17,881 --> 00:34:21,480
You know, when you have a skill, you must be getting used to that.

439
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,881
That you are drawn in by the affordances.

440
00:34:23,881 --> 00:34:26,601
That's what he agrees with at his feltist about.

441
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:30,360
Remember the arms of the heroes going out to the food in front of them.

442
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,840
Achilles doesn't say, I can reach for the grapes.

443
00:34:34,841 --> 00:34:39,641
Achilles' arm just goes out and reaches for the grapes when Achilles is hungry.

444
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,921
That's better.

445
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,801
He responds to the call of the food in front of him.

446
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:45,281
Yeah, I agree.

447
00:34:57,921 --> 00:35:02,080
Is it implied that there's an individual I as opposed to one can?

448
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,640
See, I want him to say one can.

449
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,240
And when he does say the body is, is one that perceives unique.

450
00:35:08,801 --> 00:35:11,600
I don't think he should say I can.

451
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,681
And of course, Husserl does, because he thinks the transcendental ego does it, and that's an I.

452
00:35:17,681 --> 00:35:22,241
Although Husserl once was far enough to see there was no ego, he brought it in later.

453
00:35:22,241 --> 00:35:26,080
But at the same time, what you said the body didn't percept or what is the subject?

454
00:35:26,241 --> 00:35:27,360
Yeah, I couldn't.

455
00:35:27,361 --> 00:35:28,240
I mean, I agree.

456
00:35:28,241 --> 00:35:29,921
That's what he says sometimes.

457
00:35:29,921 --> 00:35:31,681
And sometimes he's very clear.

458
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:41,440
Well, yeah, but then how what he really means, and that is, I think we both agree, there is something like a body subject.

459
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:48,721
A body subject is me as an embodied moving organism in the world.

460
00:35:48,721 --> 00:35:51,440
As long as you understand that, you're okay.

461
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,640
But when Descartes used subject, he thought of it as something separable from the world of harmony.

462
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,760
Well, I hope so.

463
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:01,120
But Hussle too?

464
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:01,601
Yeah.

465
00:36:01,921 --> 00:36:03,121
Hmm.

466
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,720
There's no transcendental subject in there doing this that could have done it even if there was no world.

467
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,281
Yeah, but is that the last thing?

468
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:14,240
So speaking, in the last analysis, but let's not talk about it now.

469
00:36:14,241 --> 00:36:21,760
I mean, I didn't until his death, Husserl thought, but in the last analysis, it was done by a transcendental subject.

470
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:37,160
I think Taylor Farming's paper says a lot on this topic, and I think their farming interprets Husserl as having this understanding of himself as being a secular totality that sticks together these subject-object qualities, and that's why it fails.

471
00:36:37,241 --> 00:36:44,361
So, even though I think it was right in the Husserl says that there is this kind of unity, this unity is really just a high popularity.

472
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,600
Okay, well, let's read Taylor Carmen and see what you think.

473
00:36:48,761 --> 00:36:49,720
Let me go back to this.

474
00:36:49,721 --> 00:36:53,960
I promised I wouldn't go into discussions, and I can't resist.

475
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,960
So, why did I do that?

476
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:00,840
Because the ICAN came up and triggered my anti-Husserl reaction.

477
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,960
So, where were we?

478
00:37:05,241 --> 00:37:07,001
Where's the ICAN?

479
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,521
Office 159.

480
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,000
I must have just read 159.

481
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,960
Yeah, I was.

482
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,761
Okay.

483
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:17,640
But again, if you're sort of warned how to hear it, you're all right.

484
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,561
I'm at the top of 161 now, where you're responding to the call.

485
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:25,080
And because it's all about what I said I would read you as it tells you what motility is.

486
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:34,440
Motility, then, is not, as it were, a handmaiden of consciousness, transporting the body to a point in space, of which we formed a representation beforehand.

487
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:40,520
In order that we may be able to move our body towards an object, the object must first of all exist for it.

488
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,841
Our body must not belong to the realm of the in itself, and so forth.

489
00:37:44,841 --> 00:37:49,401
And then, skipping to the next paragraph, the body inhabits space and time.

490
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:54,680
And that's just the same point he's making over and over.

491
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,841
So, how do we do this?

492
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:57,800
That's the next question.

493
00:37:57,801 --> 00:38:01,081
How do we inhabit space and time is with the body?

494
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:06,921
And the answer is: well, I'm setting things up, by the way, if you don't think this is really an answer, don't be upset.

495
00:38:06,921 --> 00:38:08,921
I don't think it's really an answer either.

496
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:15,121
His answer seems to be: well, we do it because we have horizons.

497
00:38:12,761 --> 00:38:16,480
In a way, that is an answer.

498
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:30,641
Phenomenologically, he's going to give you the basic phenomena in terms of this particular kind of phenomena that he's been describing: of inhabiting the world, inhabiting the body, taking up the cane, being able to do arithmetic.

499
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:40,721
All of those are examples of the kind of things we can do because, remember, I said there's always a lot on the horizon of what we're doing.

500
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,600
Now, I just want to show you places where he says that.

501
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,241
149 is a place where he says that a lot.

502
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:51,041
And it helps, I see, because there's two different meanings of subject here.

503
00:38:51,361 --> 00:38:52,960
The body is the subject.

504
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:53,921
I don't like it.

505
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,080
But anyway, he's not a Kantian subject halfway down.

506
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,480
The Kantian subject posits a world.

507
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:09,280
But in order to be able to assert a truth, the actual subject must, in the first place, have a world and be in the world.

508
00:39:09,281 --> 00:39:20,480
That is sustained around about it a system of meanings whose reciprocities, relationships, and involvements do not require to be made explicit in order to be exploited.

509
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,641
That's a very important thing.

510
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,841
One, it's telling you what the body schema is and does.

511
00:39:27,841 --> 00:39:38,081
Two, it's telling you that it's done it on the level of these meanings that are just interrelated.

512
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:45,440
And I think it's important, though I can't tell you fully why I think yet it's important.

513
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:54,241
These involvements, the way the system of meanings, which is the body schema, works, do not require to be made explicit in order to be exploited.

514
00:39:54,241 --> 00:39:56,001
Surely that's right.

515
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,521
I think he thinks, and I'm going to come back to that.

516
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,960
They don't even have to be implicit to be exploited.

517
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:11,881
To be implicit is a very, very bad intellectualist move, which is always to say, well, if you're not conscious of it, it's the same sort of thing, and you could be conscious of it.

518
00:40:11,881 --> 00:40:30,681
I want to stress, and I'll come back to it again and again, that it's very important that the Vero-Ponte, this thing which he sometimes calls the synergistic system, the way all the parts of the body and all the parts of our familiar world are interrelated, is not something that you could make explicit.

519
00:40:30,681 --> 00:40:39,001
It's not that, it's a kind of interrelatedness, which is what is sort of sui generous to the body.

520
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,881
And whenever you see implicit, you should reach for your pistol as far as I can see.

521
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,800
The latest one is Bob Brandon in his book, Making It Explicit.

522
00:40:47,801 --> 00:40:51,800
But it's already, as Brandon is proud to say, in Hegel.

523
00:40:52,120 --> 00:41:03,081
The intellectualist always claims that what they have finally been able to understand mentally must have been there all along, going on, and that they're just bringing it out.

524
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:09,321
And the happening is parade as you go by.

525
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,841
Now, what are they denouncing or defending?

526
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,000
Not very clear.

527
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,440
Does anybody know what that means?

528
00:41:21,241 --> 00:41:28,040
It's very bad to have a parade all together denouncing and defending something they know they know very well.

529
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,080
A lot of people take a lot of trouble to tell it something.

530
00:41:31,801 --> 00:41:32,921
Minority, I know.

531
00:41:35,801 --> 00:41:37,641
They want to see more of minorities?

532
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,001
How can you tell?

533
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,321
Because that's a really angel.

534
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:47,600
Six-year-old you're underrepresenting them all right.

535
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,921
How long is this going to go on?

536
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,120
Why a long time?

537
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:53,520
Okay.

538
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,640
I've got to go on talking.

539
00:41:54,881 --> 00:41:55,600
Time is short.

540
00:41:56,721 --> 00:41:57,520
Close those windows.

541
00:41:59,281 --> 00:42:00,000
Where are we?

542
00:42:01,201 --> 00:42:01,600
What?

543
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,480
Can you educate most of the education?

544
00:42:08,881 --> 00:42:12,721
Well, whatever it says, it's not what we're doing, so we better go on.

545
00:42:14,801 --> 00:42:18,960
These acquired worlds, what am I looking at 149.

546
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:27,921
But I remember I said the ones that the horizons are not implicit, and they are certainly not explicit, and they're not implicit either.

547
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:29,121
I'll come back to that.

548
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:38,160
I think that's the most important thing to to to say, because as soon as you use the word implicit, unless you want to be an intellectualist, you will find yourself an intellectualist.

549
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,001
Because the implicit says always it couldn't be it could be thought.

550
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,480
And I think that the t the corporal schema can't be thought.

551
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,281
Strong thing.

552
00:42:47,281 --> 00:43:03,041
I mean, that's the thing that you couldn't ever become aware of, but we had the total intercensorial way that everything sort of refers to everything else in some amazingly systematic way.

553
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,680
I think he thinks you cannot become aware of it.

554
00:43:05,681 --> 00:43:07,841
But again, no talking here.

555
00:43:09,361 --> 00:43:10,721
Okay, one remark.

556
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:12,160
This is always hopeless, right?

557
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,400
You're a wonderful straight person.

558
00:43:18,401 --> 00:43:21,361
Yet that's to show that that's not what we do.

559
00:43:21,921 --> 00:43:23,521
That's why he talks about it.

560
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,801
We don't do that.

561
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:29,000
We do not have to make analogies except when we understand them.

562
00:43:27,681 --> 00:43:37,081
But again, they just express this intercensorial unity that just we can just see that the thing down there is the foot of the table.

563
00:43:37,401 --> 00:43:39,561
Well, Schneider does it good.

564
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,401
And we can spell out the analogy sometimes.

565
00:43:43,401 --> 00:43:46,841
It's such a wonderful analogy John Searle's written a whole article about.

566
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:49,401
I'm thinking of Sally as a block of ice.

567
00:43:49,401 --> 00:43:50,680
Yeah, the metaphor.

568
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,600
But we can't spell that out.

569
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,281
And that's perfect for an answer to you.

570
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,720
I thank John for this because I think it's a narrow upon T-like point.

571
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:02,921
I mean, some metaphors we can spell out.

572
00:44:02,921 --> 00:44:07,641
The table is supported by that thing, the way we're supported by our legs.

573
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:11,161
But John has this Sally is a block of ice.

574
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:17,880
And he goes through a whole article trying to spell out why we feel that that tells us something important about Sally.

575
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,601
She's not literally cold.

576
00:44:20,681 --> 00:44:23,480
She's not literally hard, and so forth and so forth.

577
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,281
Anyway, I think narrow upon two things.

578
00:44:26,281 --> 00:44:39,480
That some metaphors can be spelled out, that we don't do it that way, and that I don't, and I bet he thinks, or he should think, some metaphors can't be spelled out, but that's all right, because we don't implicitly do it that way anyway.

579
00:44:40,281 --> 00:44:41,800
Okay, back to this.

580
00:44:42,921 --> 00:44:45,400
I can't resist, but I'm doing pretty well now.

581
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,201
Okay?

582
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,761
Let's see now.

583
00:44:48,761 --> 00:44:51,321
I'm at the bottom of 149.

584
00:44:51,881 --> 00:44:58,360
Well, I said the actual subjects have these meanings and so forth, and they do not require to be made explicit in order to be exploited.

585
00:44:58,361 --> 00:45:04,361
I want to say, and they can't be, and luckily they don't, because we couldn't.

586
00:45:04,361 --> 00:45:05,881
And I haven't found that in him yet.

587
00:45:05,881 --> 00:45:07,401
I'm just telling you that.

588
00:45:07,401 --> 00:45:11,641
When I move about my house, I know without thinking about it.

589
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:18,640
And I think I want to add now, I want to read this, and I'm claiming that he says this, but I haven't found the passage yet to tell you, though.

590
00:45:12,761 --> 00:45:19,600
You'll see it someday.

591
00:45:20,321 --> 00:45:23,280
When I move about my house, I know without thinking about it.

592
00:45:23,281 --> 00:45:30,480
And that means consciously or unconsciously, explicitly or implicitly, that's just not the kind of thing.

593
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,281
Know-how is not implicit know that.

594
00:45:33,281 --> 00:45:35,761
So it goes through MI again.

595
00:45:36,241 --> 00:45:40,480
I know without thinking about it that walking towards the bathroom means passing near the bathroom.

596
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:46,720
And he's spelling it out, that he's spelling it out in a way that's just sort of the tip of the iceberg, I believe he thinks.

597
00:45:46,721 --> 00:45:49,921
That looking at the window means having the fireplace on my left.

598
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:56,401
And this small world each stress for each perception is immediately related in relation to a great number of possible coordinates.

599
00:45:56,401 --> 00:46:15,921
Well, all I can say at this point is, if you're in the AI business, for instance, you think you could spell out all that we've got in this weird way, the relation of where everything is to everything else, in a kind of AI people would call a frame of my house.

600
00:46:15,921 --> 00:46:18,000
I think that is just crazy.

601
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,321
And it's turned out to be impossible for the AI people in any way.

602
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,720
But I haven't claimed I proved it yet.

603
00:46:24,721 --> 00:46:25,680
Keep your eyes open.

604
00:46:25,681 --> 00:46:32,321
Does he think this could be spelled out, that it's implicitly comprehensible in mental terms?

605
00:46:32,321 --> 00:46:35,841
Wouldn't that make him an intellectualist if he thought that?

606
00:46:35,841 --> 00:46:37,041
It sure would.

607
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:42,001
And he's not an intellectualist, he says, so we've got to be, keep your eyes open.

608
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:52,960
So at the bottom, these acquired worlds, which confer upon my experience, the secondary meaning, I themselves carry colours out of a primary world, which is the basis of a primary meaning.

609
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,360
In the same way, there is a world of thoughts.

610
00:46:55,321 --> 00:46:59,160
Oh, just giving you these parallels, the things that Schneider doesn're going to.

611
00:46:59,801 --> 00:47:11,161
A world of thoughts or a set of names left by our initial positive people to enable us to rely on our concepts and acquire judgments as we might on things that are in front of us.

612
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:21,001
So our thoughts have the same structure as the perceptual things in front of us presented globally without there being any need for us to resynthesize them.

613
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,520
That's an important line, too.

614
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,721
Remember that.

615
00:47:23,721 --> 00:47:28,280
Because everything is always already synthesized.

616
00:47:28,281 --> 00:47:30,921
That's the whole regular parts.

617
00:47:30,921 --> 00:47:38,681
Whenever you hear about synthesizing or resynthesizing, I think he doesn't think that we ever synthesize them.

618
00:47:38,681 --> 00:47:42,361
That they are synthesized, all right.

619
00:47:42,361 --> 00:47:46,681
That is, if synthesized means they have all these interconnected to each other.

620
00:47:46,921 --> 00:48:01,160
There was never a time when they had to be synthesized or resyncrified, which doesn't mean that sometimes you can acquire a new skill, like you using a blind man's painting, in which you will have to do the synthesizing.

621
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:04,760
You will have to get the bunks in the palm of your hand related to the curve.

622
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:12,040
But when you really got this pain in hand, then you nothing is synthesizing anything.

623
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:16,040
I mean, your mind isn't doing it consciously, your mind isn't doing it unconsciously.

624
00:48:16,201 --> 00:48:19,561
Before the end of the time, I'm going to try to find the brain isn't doing it either.

625
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,480
It does not done.

626
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:31,001
But the only reason you could believe in synthesis is if you made the crazy pain the money and believe that there were all these little parts to synthesize in the first place.

627
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,600
That's what makes you an intellectualist.

628
00:48:33,321 --> 00:48:43,200
If you believe that there are elements, then you believe that somehow they must be synthesized into this historic whole, then you are going to have a story about the synthesis.

629
00:48:42,841 --> 00:48:46,000
It's going to be a concept that enables you to do it or something like that.

630
00:48:46,321 --> 00:49:02,001
If you're a gestaltist and think the whole is prior to the parts, and the whole is just given both the perceptual holes, which we're just born with, some of them, some of them we learn, cultural holes we pick up by imitation, but we pick them up as a whole.

631
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,200
We never have to go through the elements unless it's some weird special thing like the wine ends.

632
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,761
I think behold.

633
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,680
But now let's see.

634
00:49:11,761 --> 00:49:13,681
So I don't have to do this.

635
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,480
There we are, 150.

636
00:49:17,761 --> 00:49:18,080
Yeah?

637
00:49:22,241 --> 00:49:25,840
Well, I said that, but I would say exactly.

638
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,520
You can always, and this is, I think, the illusion of the intellectualist.

639
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:34,561
I keep going to say, this is what I believe Merlot Function says.

640
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,520
Keep your eyes open.

641
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,120
You'll find him saying it somewhere.

642
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:41,440
If he doesn't say that he's an intellectualist, then he knows very well he's not an intellectualist.

643
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:47,360
But on this point, I want to say, what fools intellectualists say is that you can always sort of do the tip of the iceberg.

644
00:49:47,361 --> 00:49:50,080
You can start telling the stuff you know about the house.

645
00:49:50,241 --> 00:49:54,721
You mustn't think that that didn't fall like that all the way down implicitly.

646
00:49:54,721 --> 00:50:00,640
That's just what you can, on reflection, sort of turn it into, not make it out of.

647
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:05,281
And now in AI, you see this in the common sense knowledge problem.

648
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,000
You can make a lot of your common sense knowledge explicit.

649
00:50:08,321 --> 00:50:13,761
There are these wonderful examples from the one that when they're dead you stay the dead.

650
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:17,040
Or John Searle, George Bush wears underwear.

651
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:27,960
And then they're then disposed to think, not, gee, all my common sense knowledge is like that, but there is so much common sense knowledge we would never be able to get it all spelled out like that.

652
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,640
But I added one, you can't whistle and chew gum at the same time.

653
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,520
That's true, too.

654
00:50:27,201 --> 00:50:33,480
You can spell that out.

655
00:50:33,801 --> 00:50:46,121
But try spelling it all out, and the answer is going to be: I think there isn't any such thing as that total common sense knowledge list of all the common sense things you know.

656
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:53,721
And there isn't any list of how you go around your house, and the bathroom is related to the living room, and the living room is related to the kitchen, either.

657
00:50:53,721 --> 00:51:00,601
And it's an illusion, which is a very interesting illusion that you get, because you can spell out some of it.

658
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:06,121
You assume it must be the two forces that make somebody intellectualist, I think.

659
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:19,321
One, the thing that Al is saying, you can start spelling out some of it, Nero-Ponty just did, and you could spell out some metaphors, as she just did, and that you think then it must be like that all the way down.

660
00:51:19,321 --> 00:51:21,480
But why do you think it must be like that all the way down?

661
00:51:21,801 --> 00:51:26,520
Because you think it needs to be explained how you get these relations to other things.

662
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:29,720
How do you know that this movement will be related to this perception?

663
00:51:29,721 --> 00:51:35,241
How do you know that the living, when the living room is on your right, the kitchen is on your left?

664
00:51:35,241 --> 00:51:38,281
And that must be somewhere in you.

665
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:45,001
Okay, I'm going to say now what I was going to say at the end, but this is what's really on my mind today, so I might as well say it now.

666
00:51:45,881 --> 00:51:51,881
The real crunch thing that you're going to ask, and it could have been more dramatic to say it to me.

667
00:51:52,281 --> 00:51:53,400
I'll have to say it.

668
00:51:53,721 --> 00:52:09,480
The thing you're going to have to keep asking Nero-Ponty is: how are you finally going to explain all this stuff about horizon without finally becoming an intellectualist on some level and saying it's something that the mind is able to do?

669
00:52:09,480 --> 00:53:49,960
Or becoming an intellectualist on another level and saying it's something the brain does just like the mind but sort of out of touch with the mind and I think that you don't if you that's what's going to drive you the intellectualism you're going to think that you need a mental explanation of it you're going to think you need to find the rules you think you're going to think you need to be able to do implicitly what you could make explicit or that it's done unconsciously or it's done by the brain and I'm going to say no you don't need any of that and if you did need that you would be forced to be an intellectualist as everybody has been up to Marilyn Clanty yeah is it time for questions and answers then what do you think I was hoping to go on because people have too many questions a criticism is I guess his position is really demonstrated in this chapter though that at some level there must be some sort of synthesis going on with some sort of inversive knowledge because you can knock out parts of the brain and you lose just parts of the perceptual content so there are parts of the brain you can knock out and you lose and actually categories of rooms or categories of building so that's always the counter argument to what you're saying that no at no level there's no synthesis going on we can't explain okay what's forcing people into intellectualism that's interesting I don't I had never thought of that aspect that argument before I'm not impressed I mean I think Marilyn Quanti is going to say that these are artifacts of taking up parts, breakdown parts of the brain and so forth.

670
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:56,921
And if these concepts, say, rooms, started in isolation, we wouldn't be able to use them to understand rooms.

671
00:53:56,921 --> 00:54:00,041
It's only when they're part of this higher order synergistic system.

672
00:53:57,681 --> 00:54:02,121
They always have to fit in this hole.

673
00:54:02,841 --> 00:54:08,921
But that would be the right move to make if you were going to make an intellectualist move and try to say that.

674
00:54:08,921 --> 00:54:20,600
But I think you really got to believe, I'll come back to this at the end, I mean, that the brain has a certain kind of top-down holism, and we don't know much about it.

675
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:25,721
What 11 or 12 billion neurons can do, we don't know much about anyway.

676
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:30,921
I think it's late, is it up to 12, I think it's up to 12 billion neurons with 10,000 connections on each.

677
00:54:30,921 --> 00:54:32,601
It's going to talk all the time.

678
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,601
And we have no clue what it does.

679
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:38,040
But you can imagine that what it does is top-down.

680
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:41,241
That's what Walter Freeman's got supposed evidence for.

681
00:54:41,241 --> 00:54:44,601
And it doesn't do it by analyzing anything of anything.

682
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:48,601
It's important to just tell yourself that that could happen.

683
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:57,960
Because as soon as you have the idea that the brain could be doing it in a way which has nothing to do with how we move our minds, then that liberates you.

684
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,280
I'm getting, I am saying what I was going to say at the end.

685
00:55:00,841 --> 00:55:04,281
That liberates you to have to take the phenomena at face value.

686
00:55:04,281 --> 00:55:17,960
That is, it's only if you think that there's got to be an explanation of the felt top-down holism, of which there aren't any elements, and elements are only the result of the prejudice of the world.

687
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:26,440
If you think that that can't be the bottom line, there must be an explanation, then you're driven to intellectualism.

688
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:36,841
And you're driven to say, and I was going to say this at the beginning, Nero-Ponty talks about horizons, he talks about the being in the world, he talks about existence, he talks about maximum grip.

689
00:55:36,841 --> 00:55:38,600
That's all very well, Nero-Ponty.

690
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,720
You've got the best phenomenology in the world, you could say to him.

691
00:55:41,721 --> 00:55:44,401
But you can't explain how that works.

692
00:55:44,401 --> 00:55:47,360
And then the intellectual said, I've got an explanation of how it works.

693
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:49,600
And the associationist said, I've got an explanation of how it works.

694
00:55:49,841 --> 00:55:52,480
What is Merloponte supposed to say?

695
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,480
He's supposed to say, I don't need an explanation of how it works.

696
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,240
The brain does something.

697
00:55:58,801 --> 00:56:02,081
Physical stuff comes in, and the physical brain does something.

698
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,761
And then I've got a world.

699
00:56:03,761 --> 00:56:09,841
And the world is already holistic, and my body is already synergistic, and they already fit together.

700
00:56:09,841 --> 00:56:12,001
And I'm giving you a description of that.

701
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,080
And there's no reason why there has to be anything more basic than that description.

702
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,401
That's very important to keep in mind.

703
00:56:20,401 --> 00:56:24,321
Yeah, now, okay, James, and then Rick.

704
00:56:24,321 --> 00:56:30,000
Well, it just seems like if what you're worried about is reduction, reductions or something like that, and that's fine.

705
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,720
But that's not to say that there's no brain story, there's no explanation at the brain level.

706
00:56:34,721 --> 00:56:37,680
It's just that there's a different explanation, a sort of content level.

707
00:56:38,401 --> 00:56:40,000
Well, yes, but I'm not sure.

708
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,921
There's no reason why they can't work together.

709
00:56:41,921 --> 00:56:44,240
Yes, but the question is how they work together, right?

710
00:56:44,241 --> 00:56:52,161
There could be a kind of intellectualist cognitivist brain level working with an intellectualist cognitive phenomenological level.

711
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,041
That would be, Merloponty, wrong.

712
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,841
Okay, that would be wrong.

713
00:56:57,841 --> 00:57:22,321
Or there could be, and I'm claiming this is what Merloponty thinks there is, a dynamical system story to be told about the brain, where the brain is, in some holistic way, putting all this together, and all the component parts are being coordinated with each other within the brain, and there are tractors in the brain which are not ever come about, have any rules or elements in them.

714
00:57:22,321 --> 00:57:27,800
And that is correlated with the phenomena, namely, that he's describing.

715
00:57:27,801 --> 00:57:29,720
So, should this be a brain story?

716
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,520
That's what I want to say.

717
00:57:30,681 --> 00:57:35,881
If you deny a brain story, that is much too magical for anybody to believe nowadays.

718
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:42,840
It doesn't have to be a brain story that is correlative with or conceptualism or intellectualism.

719
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,801
That sort of base the question.

720
00:57:46,281 --> 00:57:55,561
And if there is this holistic brain story, then Nero Ponte doesn't owe you any explanation of how the stuff he's describing works.

721
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,800
And at least you can get the feel for this.

722
00:57:57,801 --> 00:58:03,720
The stuff he's describing works because the phenomenal world and the body are the way they are.

723
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:37,161
Now, what there is underlying is a brain doing something and a body doing something, which is correlated with, which, and I probably didn't, and you can say in Searle's terms, caused by all this stuff that Nero Ponte is talking about, it's going to be caused by and realized in the brain, that you don't want to get from that any claim that you need to, that there's something nearly descriptive about the phenomenology.

724
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,960
Because I just want you to get the feeling.

725
00:58:40,361 --> 00:58:41,560
How can I put it this way?

726
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:45,480
There are only two levels of explanation that you need, not three.

727
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,800
And the intellectualist slips in a third one.

728
00:58:47,801 --> 00:58:50,201
That's the cognitivist have always done this.

729
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:54,360
The bottom level is the brain does it somehow we haven't a clue.

730
00:58:54,361 --> 00:58:58,921
Or if we do, it's a Walker Freeman-like holistic clue.

731
00:58:59,721 --> 00:59:02,280
And we know that the phenomenon is like this.

732
00:59:02,281 --> 00:59:04,601
From that, we have Narrow-Pon T.

733
00:59:04,921 --> 00:59:23,200
But there should be underlying this concepts, rules, features, categories, any of that stuff that we use sometimes when we understand things, sometimes it's unnecessary.

734
00:59:23,201 --> 00:59:32,401
There's no have to be a third level between the neural level and the phenomenological level that explains the phenomenological level.

735
00:59:32,401 --> 00:59:34,480
They're just in different levels of description.

736
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:44,081
They're correlated, but you can't get beneath the phenomenological level to another mental level.

737
00:59:44,401 --> 00:59:45,681
That's the point.

738
00:59:45,681 --> 00:59:48,960
You can get from there to the brain level, which we don't understand.

739
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:55,521
Well, if you did understand the brain level, it might show that you don't need the mental level.

740
00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:09,361
The mental level by which I mean some operations, some rules, some noema in social language, some categories in common language, which are like making a whole framework together.

741
01:00:09,361 --> 01:00:10,960
It's not to be put together.

742
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,400
It's not to be synthesized.

743
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:13,600
Okay, that was the end.

744
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:16,321
But I was supposed to let people talk, yeah.

745
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:25,041
If I answer you to describe the way I first house we live in, can you do it?

746
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,001
Hello.

747
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,401
Is that because the house and the world is so simple?

748
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,521
Because you stored information about the house.

749
01:00:33,761 --> 01:00:35,921
Because I stored information about the house.

750
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,921
Well, that's the intellectualist illusion.

751
01:00:37,921 --> 01:00:43,201
I mean, that that you can sometimes operate like a representational system.

752
01:00:43,201 --> 01:00:51,200
There's no doubt if you can draw conclusions, you can have memories like the house, in which there are elements, I presume.

753
01:00:51,201 --> 01:00:57,921
Although probably Merrill Punky would say, well, I've got more like a field for the house would have been I could fit a few wounds in, but whatever.

754
01:00:58,761 --> 01:01:10,440
The fact that you can do mental stuff sometimes can't be an argument for you are always doing that sort of stuff whenever you are an intelligent being presenting intelligence.

755
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:14,520
So the objection is not to be weakened to write that for the legal representation.

756
01:01:14,681 --> 01:01:15,000
No.

757
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:28,121
It's that there be an explanatory level of the phenomenological level with which the whole thing is redone in terms of the fremented representations, resynthesized, in a bad way of talking.

758
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:37,640
But the only trouble is to think that there's something going on beneath the holistic compound story.

759
01:01:37,881 --> 01:01:48,281
The story of Star Garden is a kind of sound is that many of the capacities that you have have themselves in for an ancient theoretic structure.

760
01:01:48,281 --> 01:01:53,000
That is to say, they're driven by certain patterns of syntheticity.

761
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:58,361
So for example, you understand the words of signal producing your words of this knowledge.

762
01:01:58,921 --> 01:01:59,960
I don't agree with that.

763
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:00,520
Yeah, I understand.

764
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,200
This is the compositional story.

765
01:02:02,201 --> 01:02:08,440
Well, so you're excited to work some words and more exciting rules showing the word words of combination.

766
01:02:08,681 --> 01:02:10,841
And of course, we shouldn't get off too much in this.

767
01:02:10,841 --> 01:02:17,000
But then the Mero-Pantian says, okay, there is grammar may have some compositional structure.

768
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:17,960
Why not?

769
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:22,601
But it's not at all clear that semantics and its meaning does.

770
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:32,121
And it's pretty clear that pragmatics, how language actually functions when people talk to each other, doesn't have that structure, at least phenomenologically, clearly doesn't have that structure.

771
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:38,761
Why should we think that because you know grammar is compositional and has a physical cognitive structure, we should think the whole thing does.

772
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:44,720
But it challenges to accept that certain aspects of the holistic field could be thought about as computational.

773
01:02:45,281 --> 01:02:46,000
I think that's right.

774
01:02:42,681 --> 01:02:47,761
Then why doesn't it wisdom?

775
01:02:49,281 --> 01:02:53,761
Well, I mean, for one thing, it doesn't seem right, but I mean, why not?

776
01:02:53,761 --> 01:02:59,600
Because we've got arguments for the computation, compositional story of the parameter.

777
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:11,520
But if we had arguments about that there was a schema underlying my ability to walk, which put together elements into a coherent pattern, we believe it.

778
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,041
But we don't.

779
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:23,921
But you know that the final number of muscles in the body is finding the forms unless there's still in very precise ways given different forces exhibiting on them.

780
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,560
That's why it's hyper-engineers and basically to walk.

781
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:29,600
That's how you do it.

782
01:03:30,881 --> 01:03:31,361
That's right.

783
01:03:31,361 --> 01:03:32,240
You're explicit.

784
01:03:32,721 --> 01:03:39,040
And basically, but isn't mother nature just the energy engineer to perform certain things you have to conscious access?

785
01:03:39,201 --> 01:03:45,280
Well, Alan is saying just what he should say, and he was the one I was, you know, thinking a while I talked.

786
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:59,201
But I want to say, sure, the brain has to take account of this physical thing, which is the body of bones and sinews, and it has to learn how to do it so that it doesn't fall over in a gravitational field and all that.

787
01:03:59,201 --> 01:04:00,401
And it does it.

788
01:04:00,401 --> 01:04:12,480
But why we should think that it does it by rules or by concept or by anything, that it we don't have a clue as to what the brain does when it does it, but we know this much.

789
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:19,520
We don't experience bones having to be in the right relation to tendons, having to be in the right relation to gravitational fields.

790
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:23,440
We experience this holistic, synergistic system.

791
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:33,960
And why suppose that when the brain does it for us, it does it the way we do it when we're thinking about things and learning new skills?

792
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,041
I mean, that's the crucial question.

793
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:40,440
It's always reading back down into the brain's way of doing it, our way of doing it.

794
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,161
And I think Malopanti is resisting that.

795
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:44,601
Okay, now, Rick, yeah.

796
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:46,680
I just wanted to tie in what you were saying to Schneider.

797
01:04:47,241 --> 01:04:52,361
I think that's a natural question to ask, you know, in this whole chapter is why even talk about Schneider?

798
01:04:52,361 --> 01:04:55,561
Why not just tell us what's normally going on in normal people?

799
01:04:55,560 --> 01:05:05,161
And I think what might be up his sleeve is precisely this kind of philosophical scientific point where we want to get clear on these top-down explanations.

800
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:13,801
And when we look at Schneider, the mistake is not to see the holistic nature of what's going on with Schneider.

801
01:05:13,801 --> 01:05:15,480
So it's a little bit about the same thing.

802
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:19,801
Because it was so perfect until then, I've been terrific.

803
01:05:19,801 --> 01:05:23,561
It's not that we don't see the holistic thing going on with Schneider.

804
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:26,921
We don't see that Heidegger, that Schneider hasn't got the holistic thing going on.

805
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,120
Yeah, well, right, right.

806
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:32,120
And so we're not applying this holistic.

807
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,081
Yeah.

808
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:34,361
He has no horizons.

809
01:05:34,361 --> 01:05:35,801
He has no significance.

810
01:05:35,801 --> 01:05:39,881
He has no synergistic system for his body.

811
01:05:39,881 --> 01:05:41,080
And you're absolutely right.

812
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,841
I think that's a terrific thing to say.

813
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:51,000
When we do Schneider, we're supposed to see what it would be like for us to be like a computer and do everything like an intellectualist.

814
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,440
He's a caricature of him.

815
01:05:52,520 --> 01:06:01,800
Yes, he's a kind of caricature of cognitivism and intellectualism because he does have to figure out where his body is over the time.

816
01:06:01,801 --> 01:06:04,680
He's not a complete caricature because he can swat a mosquito.

817
01:06:04,681 --> 01:06:06,281
But when he's trying to figure out where...

818
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,601
That's how he's a caricature of empiricism.

819
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:09,080
Okay, good.

820
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,841
Yes, he has a reflex art.

821
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:19,361
And sometimes he's a caricature of intellectualism when he tries to find out where his hand is in objective space and his head is in objective space and then gets his hand in object.

822
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:24,800
That's like the hand-eye robot that was being built at MIT when I was there.

823
01:06:24,801 --> 01:06:26,801
They never managed to make it work.

824
01:06:26,801 --> 01:06:35,361
It couldn't have so many degrees of freedom that it needed to go through to find its objective hand and then bring it over in objective space to something else and so forth.

825
01:06:35,361 --> 01:06:36,960
And Schneider is like that.

826
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,600
Schneider is like a kind of cognitivism.

827
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:41,841
Yeah.

828
01:06:41,841 --> 01:06:55,520
And so it seems like perhaps part of introducing the Gelvin Goldstein Schneider's government is that the mistake is the fact that they think you can build up an understanding of a whole normal person from a distorted Schneider, which is a valid method.

829
01:06:55,841 --> 01:06:56,160
Maybe.

830
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,761
Maybe you're going too far.

831
01:06:57,761 --> 01:07:01,600
I mean, that would be interesting to do, but I think Merylopunty doesn't go that far.

832
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:02,000
Maybe he does.

833
01:07:02,321 --> 01:07:03,520
He talks about the being in the world.

834
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,040
You know how Schneider just doesn't kind of.

835
01:07:05,201 --> 01:07:07,201
That's right, but that's a slightly different point.

836
01:07:07,201 --> 01:07:16,161
I think the point is to see what it would be like not to have holistic being in the world and how that would be like intellectualism.

837
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:19,841
And then we see that we've got something that Schneider hasn't got.

838
01:07:19,841 --> 01:07:28,960
He doesn't, I think, try, although it'd be interesting to try, to see if you could, how you couldn't, how you could try to build up what we've got out of what Schneider's got and how you couldn't.

839
01:07:29,120 --> 01:09:36,320
I think that's what Gelden Goldstein attempts to do and why they're so peculiarly it's not just they're they're wrong in a deep methodological scientific way so that's why we have a long discussion about scientific human reduction and and it's this new understanding of science that's equal is the new understanding of our beaming the behavioral dimension which he thinks is supported by Schneider so he that's right he thinks Schneider is actually the scientific support for this new dimension of being this third he or Gel Goldstein Merloponte and so Gel and Goldstein's mistake is that they don't quite recognize that let me try to put it back to you because we're so close to getting something important right because this doesn't sound right to me yet I mean what Gelden Goldstein think is and you sort of said this you should be able to put Schneider together in a way that was like us and so you just you put more abstract attitude in and or abstract movement and more movement and and you get it all together right Schneider could be would be like us but he's lost it and and Merlopony wants to say no no you can't put these pieces together to be like us but Schneider has lost cannot be understood in terms of the pieces okay we agree about that and that's right so and uh and Del Goldstein seems to think they've got the two elements namely that concrete motion and abstract motion out of which you could build a normal person if you put them together in the right way that somehow in Schneider they've fallen apart and this is just my way of trying to get clear on the question why in the heck I lost Schneider in the first place okay and the answer is because when you have and not this what we just said that's only part of it mostly it's typical of Merloponte you look at the dysfunctional breakdown cases to see something that we got which is absolutely crucial but is so transparent like water to the fish and so ungraspable in intellectualist terms that we wouldn't see it except to see what it looks like when some when Schneider hasn't got it.

840
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:38,640
That leads him to talk about what we have got.

841
01:09:38,641 --> 01:09:42,801
That's the great lines go back on this because I want to I'll let me go on a little bit.

842
01:09:42,280 --> 01:10:01,360
I skip a bit about horizons here, but I want to say because get his diagnosis of all this, the Ashtaltists understand that Schneider lacks something, that narrow Ponte has a better understanding, a more holistic understanding than they've got.

843
01:10:01,681 --> 01:10:05,761
And they only get as far as our experience has horizons.

844
01:10:05,761 --> 01:10:07,440
That the Gestaltists know.

845
01:10:07,441 --> 01:10:11,120
Everything we do is done on a background of other things we're not doing.

846
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:19,360
And everything we do can become a figure, and then something else will be, everything in the background could be made into a figure, and then something else will be put in the background.

847
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:24,560
That's not big enough for what we need.

848
01:10:24,561 --> 01:10:31,120
What we really want to think is that why does all our experience have horizons?

849
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:37,120
Because we're involved in coping, and that's called existence.

850
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:40,480
I want to run through all these quotings that my old kind has left.

851
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:47,280
And so you'll see how the argument goes and how it looks like an explanation, but it isn't, and it isn't supposed to be.

852
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:53,680
So there's this stuff on 140 about a deeper intentionality at the bottom, which we saw already.

853
01:10:53,681 --> 01:10:56,560
That's called exhibit.

854
01:10:56,881 --> 01:11:02,000
And that's what Neider lacks, the bottom of 140.

855
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:17,681
We read it last time, that there is it's concrete and abstract movement, but and then it looks like there's only in itself existence and for itself existence, but then in the footnote, there's a deeper intentionality, which others have called existence.

856
01:11:17,681 --> 01:11:18,960
That's Heidegger.

857
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:24,160
And that's the third term in the next footnote between the psychic and the physiological.

858
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:27,960
And we're always led to that.

859
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,640
We call it existence.

860
01:11:27,521 --> 01:11:31,960
Well, that gets us a little further.

861
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:39,240
We realize that existence is all tied up with the intentional arc, which normal subjects have.

862
01:11:40,761 --> 01:11:50,520
Well, but he calls it the bottom of 152, sort of badly, a subject-object dialogue, a drawing together by the subject of the meanings of use through the object and so forth.

863
01:11:50,521 --> 01:11:55,000
And he's talking about all that, and it's lacking in Schneider's taste.

864
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:00,841
But when he finally gets down to what he wants to call it, he calls it an intentional arc, remember?

865
01:12:00,841 --> 01:12:01,721
Now, where is that?

866
01:12:01,721 --> 01:12:04,200
I just missed 150.

867
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,561
I got the wrong market.

868
01:12:06,521 --> 01:12:07,240
Oh, there it is.

869
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:07,641
I've got it.

870
01:12:07,641 --> 01:12:08,921
It should be 150.

871
01:12:08,921 --> 01:12:13,080
I mean, that's not the first, the only place, but that's the one we want right now.

872
01:12:13,721 --> 01:12:23,400
The bottom of 150, he says, the world with its two stages of sedimentation and spontaneity is at the core of consciousness.

873
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:30,200
And it is in the light of the leveling down of the world, which is so sustained in this Schneider's problem.

874
01:12:30,681 --> 01:12:35,320
What Schneider leveled down is the intentional arc.

875
01:12:36,521 --> 01:12:40,120
I guess I said this in 20 different places in 20 different ways.

876
01:12:41,481 --> 01:12:43,560
Well, 157.

877
01:12:43,881 --> 01:12:48,761
Yeah, that's the main one, which we looked at last time, but it's very, very important.

878
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:57,400
What he calls the intentional arc is the way our experience is constantly feeding out into the world, remember.

879
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:09,560
So that it projects around itself about 10 lines down, the life of consciousness, cognitive life, perceptual life, and this intentional arc is always there.

880
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:14,480
But then he says it projects around itself, which is bad.

881
01:13:12,761 --> 01:13:16,881
We don't want to say that, our past, our future, and so forth.

882
01:13:17,441 --> 01:13:23,200
Or whether, and now he gets it right, it results in our being situated in all these respects.

883
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:27,761
It is the intentional art, that is, we don't project it around us, live just in it.

884
01:13:27,761 --> 01:13:37,120
It's not a searchlight, remember, he says, that we have and we want to think is that we are in, always think of the feedback thing.

885
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:41,440
We're in a world which is already full of meaning, always already full of meaning.

886
01:13:41,441 --> 01:13:43,841
We never get a meaningful hand.

887
01:13:43,841 --> 01:13:48,080
But if we act in and then we enrich with more and more meaning, and then it shows up.

888
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:52,240
And so, or whether which results in our being situated in all these look better.

889
01:13:52,881 --> 01:13:58,960
It is this intentional art which brings about the unity of the senses, of intelligence, of sensibility, and motility.

890
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,040
It's that which goes limp in Schneider.

891
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:03,040
Schneider hasn't got it.

892
01:14:03,521 --> 01:14:08,320
Now, the next question is: and the intentional art is the same as being in the world.

893
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:12,640
That should be obvious, being already in the world.

894
01:14:13,441 --> 01:14:22,560
And on 141, he says, I've been right there in two ways of relating to the object, two types of being in the world.

895
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:25,921
We've seen that a lot.

896
01:14:25,921 --> 01:14:30,640
So now we've seen it's level on 150.

897
01:14:30,881 --> 01:14:32,400
We've got the leveling down of the world.

898
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,520
It goes limp.

899
01:14:33,521 --> 01:14:35,520
And now, why does it go limp in Schneider?

900
01:14:35,521 --> 01:14:40,240
I just want to show you that there are a whole lot of sort of explaining questions that don't really explain anything.

901
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:43,601
But it turns out because it lacks the power to sustain it.

902
01:14:43,601 --> 01:14:46,000
Or the middle of 155.

903
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:51,280
But patient's being, his power of existence, is what his illness is taking.

904
01:14:51,280 --> 01:15:06,841
So existing turns out to be a kind of energy, as he calls it in the Phantom Limb chapter, an energy that you have to open up a world if you're healthy, and this power can go weak if you're ill, and then your world collapses.

905
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:11,400
The middle of 1506: future and past are shrunk in extension of the present.

906
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:15,960
He's lost our power of looking according to the temporal vector.

907
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:18,360
Well, now we've got this magical power hidden.

908
01:15:18,441 --> 01:15:20,040
That doesn't really explain anything.

909
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:22,280
You just renamed the problem.

910
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:25,960
So, well, what is this power?

911
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:30,601
Well, it's a tendency toward basic COVID.

912
01:15:30,601 --> 01:15:34,200
I mean, all of these things are just names for the same thing, I think.

913
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:35,960
They're not really explaining anything.

914
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:39,881
But I hope I've tried to convince you that you don't have anything to explain.

915
01:15:41,641 --> 01:15:45,560
So I've done that one.

916
01:15:45,561 --> 01:15:49,560
It's called, it's something, it's a momentum called existence, he calls it.

917
01:15:49,561 --> 01:15:50,360
A momentum.

918
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:53,080
So you've got these energy, these dynamic terms.

919
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:56,200
It's an energy, it's a power, it's a momentum.

920
01:15:56,200 --> 01:16:00,921
Existence is all at about five lines down in 159.

921
01:16:00,921 --> 01:16:03,881
Now, here's an important point I'm still getting.

922
01:16:03,881 --> 01:16:07,160
Insects already have this momentum of existence.

923
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:12,200
Remember, if you tie up one leg, they go struggling on to do things at another leg.

924
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:15,000
What do we have that insects don't have?

925
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,480
Well, we have the intentional arc.

926
01:16:17,481 --> 01:16:18,841
What's the difference?

927
01:16:18,841 --> 01:16:21,560
Insects just have a fixed world.

928
01:16:21,561 --> 01:16:24,841
Our world is constantly enriched by what we learn.

929
01:16:24,841 --> 01:16:26,280
That's very important.

930
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:37,801
In AI, that's the difference between the animats that they've now got at MIT that Rodney Brooks is making, which already would be said to have existence, maybe, that they don't learn.

931
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:39,960
Their world doesn't change.

932
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,721
And that's very important.

933
01:16:41,721 --> 01:16:43,681
We've got that, and the higher animals have it.

934
01:16:43,921 --> 01:16:47,600
But then the next question becomes: and why do we have it?

935
01:16:47,601 --> 01:16:56,720
Well, it's because, and now you're beginning to sound familiar, although you're not really learning anything new, it's because we have a tendency to get a maximum grip on the world.

936
01:16:56,721 --> 01:16:58,560
This is on 177.

937
01:16:58,881 --> 01:17:00,400
And so let's look at that.

938
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,240
It's a very important paragraph.

939
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,320
Penlines from the bottom.

940
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,120
I'm going to read it fast.

941
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:09,440
Whether a system of motor or perceptual powers, our body is not an object or an IP.

942
01:17:09,441 --> 01:17:13,520
It's a group of lived through means which move toward equilibrium.

943
01:17:13,521 --> 01:17:17,600
And our natural powers come together in a richer media.

944
01:17:17,601 --> 01:17:19,520
And then it's skipping a little.

945
01:17:19,521 --> 01:17:25,040
So, and we re-shuffle these elements into an equilibrium.

946
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,440
Now, why am I making a fuss about that?

947
01:17:27,441 --> 01:17:39,280
Because this talk about getting toward a maximum richness, getting more rich, getting equilibrium, all that finally is maximum grip talk.

948
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:44,000
So the whole thing bottoms out if you ask, well, why do we want to cope?

949
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:51,360
Well, we want to cope finally in order to get the richest grip, which gives us an equilibrium with the world.

950
01:17:51,681 --> 01:17:53,680
And that's the bottom line.

951
01:17:53,681 --> 01:18:13,761
Now, I can say quickly, because I said it early, and if you say that you haven't explained anything, Maryland, you've just gone from wider and wider things, from the horizon to existence, to being in the world, to coping with everything, to finally trying to get an optimal grip on everything, the biggest thing.

952
01:18:13,761 --> 01:18:15,200
What does that explain?

953
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,680
How do we do that?

954
01:18:17,681 --> 01:18:21,360
And I think the answer is supposed to be: there's nothing we can explain.

955
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:27,360
I mean, something is going on in the brain, and we get a world in which we can and do that.

956
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:32,520
And all we can know is to do is describe the world in which we can and do that.

957
01:18:32,521 --> 01:18:40,680
What you don't want to do is give an account, that's the intellectualist story, of some mental operations which enable us to do it.

958
01:18:40,681 --> 01:18:48,841
Because if you get the right feeling of the holistic bound story, then there couldn't be any mental operations that enable us to do it.

959
01:18:48,841 --> 01:18:51,000
And that's where we can stop.

960
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:51,480
Okay.
