1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I to go back and talk more about attention.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:14,159
It was too easy, I thought, that how clear I was and how quickly I got through the part on attention, and then I realized that I had sort of misread a whole chunk of it.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,480
Not that I'm taking back anything, but there's a piece of it that I just didn't put in.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:35,440
The easy part, just to remind you where we are, was to say that the intellectualist uses the idea of attention in this double way, uses attention to break down the result.

5
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:55,439
Remember from Erloponte, always the whole determines what counts as the part, but you can, by focusing attention on the parts, make them come out of the hole and then see the line for the molar layer illusion is equal, or the moons or two as the same size on the horizon as in between it.

6
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:06,559
So you could use attention to take apart the whole and find elements, which more or less I suspect correspond to what's on your retina.

7
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:07,600
Where did they come from?

8
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,999
They're not elements that were implicit in the whole.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,680
He's very clear about that.

10
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,039
The whole determines the parts, but when you break down the whole, there is something.

11
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:33,999
Well, I presume that's where the constancy hypothesis may be right, that if you take an analytic enough attitude, like a painter or an introspectionist, you can actually see something that roughly corresponds to what you're getting on your sense organs.

12
00:01:33,999 --> 00:01:42,079
That's certainly a misleading and wrong-headed way of using attention, unless you're a painter.

13
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:52,479
And it has a further, it wouldn't be misleading just like that, because there's nothing wrong with breaking down your perception and finding these elements.

14
00:01:52,719 --> 00:02:06,999
The second half is the brainer that makes it evil, and that is that you think of attention as a searchlight, that is not being, as he calls it, being neutral, not adding or taking away anything.

15
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:10,280
And if you it's just like noticing.

16
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:17,479
When I notice something, I don't do anything to what I've noticed, at least not in a normal sort of noticing.

17
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:25,559
But this kind of attention, this special kind of isolating analytic attention, is not neutral.

18
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:27,480
It's not like a searchlight.

19
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,159
It doesn't reveal what was already there.

20
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:42,839
Just in saying that, it produces something new, namely what these elements would look like if they didn't get their whole meaning in the song.

21
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:46,520
So you break down the Moller-Liar illusion and get two equal lines.

22
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:52,439
But in your normal perception, you see them as unequal.

23
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,119
And it takes a lot of effort.

24
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:55,320
I don't think we could do it.

25
00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:00,920
I think you probably have to be a painter or an imperfectionist to get the ends of the Moller-Liar illusion.

26
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,360
You know what I'm talking about.

27
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:07,320
Try to see, of course, I'm not going to draw it fair enough to make it count.

28
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:12,039
But I mean, try to see those ends gone and the lines are equal.

29
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,800
Maybe they are, maybe they aren't.

30
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,759
Probably they aren't.

31
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:17,239
I'm not trying to convince you.

32
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:41,240
Anyway, so it's when you think that attention reveals what was there all along, that you make the experience error, you take it that what you're seeing is what's there in the determinate world, or you make the sensory core error, the same error, just described with different motivations.

33
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:49,999
The sensory core error, you think that what you've got when you've done this analytic kind of reflecting is what was there all along.

34
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,680
And then, of course, you ask yourself the question: well, how does experience build up?

35
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:06,800
How are the elements, which are what you really see, and the experience of objects which seem to be holes with determining their parts and so forth.

36
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:19,920
Well, then you give an associationist story if you're an empiricist, or you give an intellectual story, which we haven't gotten to, we were just getting there, if you are intellectualist.

37
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,839
But now I realize that there's another thing going on.

38
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:30,959
So let me just start with a quote that I just mentioned.

39
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:41,999
So on 32, he's telling you that all the ways that you can make a perception break down.

40
00:04:43,999 --> 00:04:49,039
And then he says, I just want to remind you that Merrill-Ponte often isn't saying what he thinks.

41
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:58,160
He says on about five lines down on 32, inattentive perception contains nothing more, and indeed nothing other than the attentive kind.

42
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,600
That's not his view.

43
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:05,600
That's the neutral searchlight view of attention.

44
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:26,800
That says that when, well, and it's putting them in the language of the uh intellectualist, the intellectualist thinks that attentive perception, focusing on deconceptual, decontextualizing and focusing on the elements, is real attention.

45
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,160
And our ordinary way of being in the world and paying attention to things isn't real attention.

46
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,559
That's inattentive attention.

47
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:41,639
So inattentive attention is what we've got when we focus on something and bring out the details of it.

48
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,639
We talked about that last time.

49
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:52,040
When you you focus on the some aspect and make it more of a figure and put something that you were paying attention to into the background.

50
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,840
That's ordinary attention.

51
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:30,199
That's inattentive attention from the point of view of the intellectualist who thinks attentive attention is isolating the element from Gustav and also thinks inattentive perception contains nothing more and nothing other than the attentive kind, meaning that the everyday kind of attention, which they think of as not real attention, is only what real attention, that is analytic attention, reveals.

52
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,879
But that's a weird sense.

53
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:34,360
I thought I would just try to make sense of it for you.

54
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,520
It's saying the same thing I said.

55
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:44,519
He's got so many different words of talking about attention in his own words and in the words of the other.

56
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:47,240
Yeah, okay, one more time.

57
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,720
But there's everyday attention.

58
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,879
That's not what he's talking about.

59
00:06:51,879 --> 00:07:06,360
There is but everyday attention is called by the sensually poor people, the analytic people, the intellectually, inattentive attention.

60
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:16,320
Because the everyday attention isn't paying attention to what the analytic person thinks you could be paying attention to with real attention.

61
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,680
What is real attention?

62
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,680
It's isolating what you're looking at from the context and breaking down the whole.

63
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:42,639
And then this same person who thinks that everyday attention is what he calls inattentive attention, he thinks that that is really what you see and what you see when you pay careful attention, which is analytic attention.

64
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,160
And that's just the neutral spotlight idea of attention.

65
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:55,760
So inattentive perception, everyday paying attention, contains nothing more and indeed nothing other than the attentive kind.

66
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:06,559
That is, it's always really just what the analytic element-finding attention gives you.

67
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:10,079
Only, that's why they call it inattentive.

68
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,720
You just don't pay enough attention to notice that.

69
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:27,519
If you really paid attention, you'd see what painters see when they paint when Monet paints the cadilla of Rouen about five different times a day and sees it as an entirely different looking something or other with different colors and everything.

70
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,440
Or you see it, what introspectionist psychologists do, they are really paying attention.

71
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:48,400
But when you are not really paying attention, your experience is nonetheless what they say it is, and they have the right to tell you that you're wrong because they're really paying attention and you are not.

72
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:49,839
You get it, yeah?

73
00:08:50,479 --> 00:09:05,480
So until you get to be able to pay attention like that, like an introspectionist psychologist who can see just the thing and not the context, you get so you need to pay attention to the lines and not the end, you aren't really paying attention.

74
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,400
That's why you don't see that.

75
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,000
But that's there all along.

76
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,040
The sensory core is really your experience of two equal lines with little things on the end.

77
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,839
And if you pay careful analytic attention, that's what you see.

78
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,840
That's packed in that one funny sentence as a way of reviewing.

79
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:26,280
If you haven't got it, it doesn't matter.

80
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:34,680
I mean, if the idea is important, you could if you take time, you could sort of do that you could translate that sentence into what I've been saying if you want to.

81
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,160
The sentence is on 32.

82
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:43,960
I just picked it out of the way to summarize and show you how weird it all is.

83
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,319
Inattentive, about five lines down.

84
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:52,200
Inattentive perception contains nothing more and indeed nothing other than the attentive.

85
00:09:52,599 --> 00:09:57,639
I hope that after all I just said that could be a good exam question and you could answer it.

86
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,920
You could explain what that sentence means.

87
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:06,120
It's just a funny, condensed way of saying the story we've been saying so far.

88
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,960
Oh, thanks.

89
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:08,439
Good.

90
00:10:08,439 --> 00:10:16,200
Okay, yes, it's good if somebody who has the older version says the other page number, that would be helpful.

91
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:19,800
Sometimes I have the other page number, but I don't know if I had that one.

92
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,840
Yeah, I did.

93
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:22,120
Okay.

94
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,080
Now so now attention's not a search light.

95
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:30,360
It breaks down the perceptual field.

96
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,880
It's not revealing by carefully paying attention what's been there all along.

97
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,000
It's not neutral and so forth.

98
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:43,439
That's he's saying it again on 33.

99
00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:47,440
I don't know, you'll have to find it because I don't have the other page number in here.

100
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,839
But I wanted to read the end of the paragraph.

101
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:55,280
You can find it because it's right before a new paragraph that begins against this conception.

102
00:10:55,599 --> 00:11:00,800
So it says, perceptual consciousness is confused with the exact forms of thought of thought.

103
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,600
Is it that one?

104
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,280
No, I just say it again, there's no reason why.

105
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,040
Attention creates nothing.

106
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:15,520
But I guess I'm reading it because I want you to realize we're inside the, that's not Merlot-Ponte's view that attention creates nothing.

107
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:28,640
He's talking from within the intellectualist, where perceptual consciousness is confused and so forth and doesn't get it, doesn't get it right.

108
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:46,000
In spite of the intentions of intellectualism, the two doctrines then, that is, empiricism and idealism and intellectualism, have this idea in common that attention creates nothing, since a world of impressions in itself or a universe of determining thoughts are equally independent of the action of the mind.

109
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,040
That is, we are just finding out what's there.

110
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,280
Okay, that's where we were last time.

111
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,760
But now we go on, and very strange things are happening.

112
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,239
We ask, well, these are all bad stories about attention.

113
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:01,760
What is attention really?

114
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,920
What is its positive function?

115
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,080
And I think there are two.

116
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:17,680
And last time I was talking about one of them and did it, sort of, and that is, it's this enriching function where you sort of zoom in on something and explore it.

117
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:25,920
That's on, again, because I when I sometimes I have the old page numbers, but sometimes I don't.

118
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,439
I'm now going to, but now I get worried.

119
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:32,439
I'm not going to try to do it if you find it.

120
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:42,440
I want to read where just another version of this enriching talk is a paragraph that begins, now attention, about halfway down.

121
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:49,559
The miracle of consciousness consists in its bringing to life through attention phenomena which re-establish the unity of the object.

122
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,119
Whoa!

123
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:50,839
No.

124
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:54,920
I mean, that's no, in the sense I shouldn't be reading that yet.

125
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,440
Wait a minute.

126
00:12:56,439 --> 00:12:58,280
Now let's look at my notes.

127
00:12:58,439 --> 00:13:00,200
That's what I want to talk about next.

128
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,720
So where is interesting?

129
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:05,719
I think I just wrote something wrong here.

130
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:06,920
Don't worry about it.

131
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:17,080
What I, this enriching function is the way that your attention is drawn to something because you're interested in it or looking for it.

132
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:22,120
And then you respond by making the unpacking the horizon.

133
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,520
And I talked about how that year ago.

134
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:27,640
Sorry, is that what I'm looking for?

135
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,680
Go ahead, where?

136
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:31,319
Well, the one with the paragraph is now thinking.

137
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:31,800
Yeah.

138
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,719
Well, interesting, interesting.

139
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,800
I got to look at that because I decided maybe that that's one of the places where he's doing something different than I thought.

140
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,880
Let me that's why I stopped when I started reading it.

141
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,759
Let's read it and find out.

142
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,639
So pay attention is not merely further to elucidate pre-existing data.

143
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,520
It's to bring out a new articulation of them by taking them as figures.

144
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:01,000
They are performed only as preformed only as horizons.

145
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,360
They constitute a really new region of the total world.

146
00:14:04,359 --> 00:14:09,079
No, oddly enough, that is exactly not any the same thing.

147
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:10,920
That's why my notes confuse me.

148
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,680
There are two different things going on.

149
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:20,959
The positive use of perception is to bring out something as figure on a background.

150
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,920
That's why this is so confusing and misleading.

151
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:54,640
What I read last time on page 78 of this, with the view right at the beginning of the chapter, Experience and Objective Thought, if you look, that's where, I'll just leave you to see an object is to have it on the fringe of consciousness, or to see an effect, turn on the horizon and open it up, become anchored in it, and so forth, exploring it.

152
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:05,759
And you close up the background where you were and make it into a figure, and you plunge into it and so forth.

153
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:13,600
All that is well expressed in the, by the way, and maybe I'll go a little further than I did last time.

154
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,880
I don't think I said this.

155
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:24,160
He has this great difference between this kind of positive role of attention, of bringing out what was on the horizon.

156
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:37,920
When he says it doesn't happen in movies, he has this brilliant idea to every once in a while, compare what he's talking about to movies, because movies don't have figure ground characteristics.

157
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,559
And a film is like the retina.

158
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:43,520
It's just got some determinant something on it.

159
00:15:43,520 --> 00:16:00,360
So he'll say later that when a train comes at you in a movie, it looks like it gets bigger and bigger very fast because the movie is just registering the size of the projection through the lens onto the film of the train.

160
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:03,079
And it's very different than our normal experience of trains.

161
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:07,720
Well, here he's saying that when you, and this is really quite amazing, I'm going to read this.

162
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:16,680
When in a film the camera is trained on an object and moves nearer to give a close-up, we can remember that we're being shown the ashtray or the actor's hand.

163
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:21,800
We do not actually identify it because the screen has no horizon.

164
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,160
I'm now on page 78 of the book you guys all have, I hope, about 15 lines from the bottom.

165
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,720
And that's the story.

166
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:50,280
If we sort of focus in on the ashtray and make it the center of our attention, this is our kind of attention, and put the previous theme, let's say, of the person smoking, into the background.

167
00:16:50,280 --> 00:17:07,959
And so we understand that in our if that happened in our experience, we'd have the ashtray on the margin and we'd zoom in on it in the sense of bring it out of the margin into the focus.

168
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:11,719
But the camera, I mean, I don't know what would happen if the camera zoomed in on it.

169
00:17:11,719 --> 00:17:12,840
He doesn't have zooms.

170
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,520
It'd be interesting to figure that out.

171
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:15,959
I don't want to do it in front of you.

172
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,999
We wouldn't be doing what we're doing.

173
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:32,119
Even if it zoomed in on the ashtray, you'd have to figure out that that's the ashtray which was there in the picture before, but not at all something you were noticing on the horizon.

174
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:34,519
You wouldn't, you have to associate with it.

175
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,400
How does he put it?

176
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,160
You have to figure out.

177
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:48,239
You have to remember that there was an ashtray there, and now that on the edge of the picture, and you have to figure out that it's the same ashtray that you now see in a close-up, yeah, zooming in once.

178
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:51,439
You now see in the close-up, a cigarette being put out.

179
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:54,160
That you could figure that out how movies work.

180
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,279
But that's not the way we experience it.

181
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:09,519
Okay, so all that's supposed to be one kind of positive function, what I'm calling enriching it or having your attention drawn to something or unpacking it, as he talks about it sometimes.

182
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:12,079
Now, but there's another one.

183
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,640
There are really two functions.

184
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:16,799
Go back to 31.

185
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,279
You know, a quick way to give you a hint that this is coming.

186
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:25,039
31 is way back at the beginning of the attention chapter in the second paragraph.

187
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:37,680
He just says, in very brief, about 10 lines down, in order to relate it to the life of consciousness, one has to show how a perception awakens attention and kind of how attention develops and enriches it.

188
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,599
Now, that I misread, I misannounced.

189
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,840
That doesn't tell you what I'm about to tell you, but I'm going to show you.

190
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,360
There's two senses in which it develops and enriches you.

191
00:18:51,360 --> 00:19:01,680
We just talked about the one, by focusing on the ashtray on the margin and burrowing into it, taking it up as your whole interest.

192
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:08,400
But there's another sense, totally different of enriching it, which is now what we have to look at.

193
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,160
And this is what I haven't realized ever.

194
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,959
That's why I spend time on it now because I started teaching it to myself.

195
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:25,839
It also has, and I'm amazed that he brings this in because he doesn't develop it and he doesn't prepare you for it.

196
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:40,119
It's got the positive job of opening up the conceptual world in which we see everything as determinate figures, so that we see determinate objects with properties.

197
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:52,119
That's another role of attention, a positive, important role of attention, such that you can pay attention to this lecture.

198
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,720
Not, I mean, there are three ways you can pay attention to it, really.

199
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:06,599
You can pay attention to it as trying to see it like an impression, break it down into its visual element.

200
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:14,439
You can pay attention to it by getting really interested in it and sort of burrowing in on it and unfolding it.

201
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:22,759
Or you can observe it as an object, a stable object with a certain shape and size, an object with qualities.

202
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:24,840
And it's important to be able to do that.

203
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,519
And it's something we do.

204
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:33,319
And it's something that he has so little to say about that when he does, you don't even notice that.

205
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,240
And that's why, I want to talk about this for a minute.

206
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:40,599
And maybe it comes up more often in this book than I realize.

207
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:51,000
Right now, I'm on page 33 of him talking about, well, I don't know yet because my notes are so confused because I just was getting used to this.

208
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,920
33.

209
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,799
The first, the full paragraph.

210
00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:19,759
Against this conception of an inactive subjects, the analysis of attention by the psychologists, that's the Gashalt people, acquires the value of a self-discovery and the criticism of the constancy hypothesis that develops into a criticism of the dogmatic belief in the world seen as a reality in itself by empiricists and as the imminent of knowledge by intellectualists.

211
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,519
Attention, first of all, this is the crucial sentence that woke me up.

212
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:31,759
Attention, first of all, presupposes a transformation of the mental field, a new way for consciousness to be present to its objects.

213
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:36,559
Now, I've always thought, yeah, breaking down the gestalt.

214
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,640
But no, this is something that is a good way.

215
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:47,280
Attention is the way we have the experience of the presence of stable objects.

216
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:53,199
Now, on that one sentence alone, you could never base a lecture or get very interested.

217
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:55,680
But it goes on for a while.

218
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:59,920
The middle of page 34, the next page.

219
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,599
And what he's going to tell you, I have to prepare you because it's always so obscure.

220
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:10,319
Attention here stands for what I call detached observation something.

221
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,360
There's really two kinds of detached observation.

222
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,239
I said last time, once or two times ago, impressionist painters have it.

223
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,999
They have it in this breakdown, the whole way.

224
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,400
But there's another kind of detached observation.

225
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,199
I'm just hoping.

226
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:26,560
Just look at the lectern.

227
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,120
Look at the stable characteristics it's got.

228
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:42,239
Don't break it down into elementary impressions, but don't get involved in it and cope with it and make it transparent like it is for me, just something supporting papers which I don't even see.

229
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:43,759
Just study it.

230
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:48,239
And that's when you get a certain form of detachment.

231
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:52,479
Really, just objectively paying attention is what he's talking about.

232
00:22:52,479 --> 00:24:30,160
And he says it in the middle of the page: the active attention can localize or objectify this invariant factor like the characteristics he's got a very complicated brain injured face but I don't talk about that that objectify this invariant factor because it has stepped back notice that that's the interesting thing step back from the changes of appearance attention therefore as a general and formal activity doesn't exist there is in each case a certain liberty to be acquired a certain mental faith to make the most of it it remains to bring to light the object of attention itself there is literally a question of creation boy lots of strange things are happening here you step back you actually bring to light something about the object but this is not like the sensory core theory carried up to the level of objects it isn't as if you see the object as it really it isn't if you really understand perception it isn't that you think you see the objects as it just is you see that you have created a new way of organizing your experience in which stable objects will now appear to you that's this creation it's not here's a good way to put it it never occurred to me that the first the bad attention then when I say bad I don't mean it's you it's you shouldn't ever be an impressionist or a stale psychologist but the misleading kind of impress attention is a destruption of something.

233
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:35,920
It's a destruction of a global whole into its elements.

234
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:39,599
This kind of attention is the creation of something.

235
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:59,599
It's the creation of the everyday stable substances with properties that we normally experience and which we think are just there all along and that we are just open minds that open heads that see them.

236
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:15,920
But he wants to give you a story about how you manage to stabilize your experience into this new form in which I think you could say, and this is where the core of that figure comes in, everything is free.

237
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:23,999
You manage to make qualities and the taste and everything determinate.

238
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:36,640
And then, you'll hear more about this later, you get the retroactive illusion that you're just an empty head turned towards a completely determinate world.

239
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,959
Whereas in fact, you have to compose the text before.

240
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:43,120
You want to decompose it.

241
00:25:43,120 --> 00:26:06,479
You want to decompose it into the figure of ground objects whose involved with and have all kinds of characteristics like attractive and repulsive and they're tending towards, I guess, draw you to get a better and better grip on them.

242
00:26:06,479 --> 00:26:09,359
The whole Merlopante is really interesting.

243
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:15,119
Our involved perception of the significance of things as we cope with them.

244
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:24,479
That's one way we compose the world into significant, useful affordances, to use the gate.

245
00:26:24,479 --> 00:26:35,559
And now we're talking of another way we compose the world, into stable objects which we're able to contemplate and look at the determinant characteristics of and develop a science about and so forth.

246
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,800
And oddly enough, that's what he's talking about here.

247
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:40,519
I mean, I really bet on it.

248
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:45,640
Partly because it's a new kind of creation that you get when you step back.

249
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,279
Notice that.

250
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:52,360
I'm not going to say, I'm making a fuss about that because it isn't stepping back that gives you affordances.

251
00:26:52,360 --> 00:27:02,760
You've got affordances when you're about to go out the door and the floor and the floor affords support when you're hungry and the food affords eating and you find your arm going out to the food.

252
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:05,799
That's the level that Meropony is interested in.

253
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:08,680
That's the absorbed phenomenon.

254
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:20,119
But, lo and behold, you can, and he's better say this, step back somehow and see objects that don't afford anything, that are just stable substances with properties.

255
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,199
And that's what he's talking about, I swear.

256
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:22,839
Okay.

257
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,439
But the pretty suspect.

258
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,959
Okay.

259
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:28,279
The changes of appearance.

260
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:36,039
Well, good, good, okay.

261
00:27:36,439 --> 00:27:36,920
I'll buy that.

262
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,039
Like something which you think is only achieved through a different kind of thing.

263
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:43,559
Okay, I'll buy that.

264
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,839
I need a better place.

265
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,040
I'll look for a better place.

266
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,239
I think we'll find one.

267
00:27:47,239 --> 00:28:02,839
Because the reason that happens is because he's doing this, he's in terms of the brain-injured people who can't get a distance from their sensory field of experience.

268
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,959
And so it keeps shifting whenever they shift their attention.

269
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:09,799
And this gets you some way of stepping back.

270
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:14,239
And I guess, let me see if I can find that you said the opposite.

271
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:14,880
Really?

272
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,359
Wow.

273
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:15,920
Tell me.

274
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,359
Did you go back further into the beginning of that paragraph?

275
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:19,599
Yeah.

276
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,920
He says, attention, first of all, he starts with the transformation of the mental field.

277
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:27,039
A new way to consciousness is present to its object.

278
00:28:27,199 --> 00:28:31,999
And the example he gives is rotating position on his own body.

279
00:28:31,999 --> 00:28:37,279
I know, that's why I say it's misleading, or I think misleading, that he comes in that context.

280
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,359
I was trying to take it out of that context.

281
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,519
But let's go back to 33.

282
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,839
Remember this is this business now?

283
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:47,999
Wait a minute, I don't want to say against the anastic subject.

284
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,999
You think of it, especially in your body where you engage more.

285
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:58,879
Yeah, but this guy, but this is this brain-injured person who doesn't have the normal relation.

286
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,119
We've got to find a place outside of that.

287
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,319
But until we do, I haven't made my point.

288
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,560
So let me try to find a place where I can.

289
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,079
Well, I mean, it sort of cuts both ways on 33.

290
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,320
He says about six lines down.

291
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:28,479
He says, attention, first of all, presupposes a transformation of the mental field, a new way for consciousness to be present to its objects.

292
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:30,719
Now, that's what we're trying to understand.

293
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:32,800
What is this new way?

294
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:47,599
And now let's see if on 35, the paragraph that begins now, attention, I want to say I think this is now I want to claim that this is the kind of attention I'm going to talk about now that gives us very low odds.

295
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,080
Now, attention has to be conceived on the model of the primary axis.

296
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,920
Secondary attention, which would be limited to equality.

297
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:59,239
Knowledge already gained once more identifies with an axis with actual existing.

298
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,039
Now, I don't know what that means, but I'm not going to try to stop the patent.

299
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:02,359
I'm done.

300
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:11,719
To pay attention is not merely further to elucidate pre-existing data, it's to bring about a new articulation of them by taking them as figures.

301
00:30:11,719 --> 00:30:16,599
They are translated, are performed only as preformed only as arises.

302
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,280
They constitute in reality new things in the total world.

303
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:29,959
It's precisely the original structure which they introduce that brings about the identity of the object before and after the act of attention.

304
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:34,600
Now, I think that's got to do with getting these qualities.

305
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:41,239
Once the color quality is acquired, and only by means of it do the previous data appear as preparations of this quality.

306
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:47,239
Once you go forth, now I'm still looking for what it is.

307
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:59,959
Skipping down, the miracle of consciousness consists in its bringing to light, through attention, phenomena which re-establish the unity of the object in a new dimension at the very moment they destroy it.

308
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:18,680
This attention is neither an association of images nor the return of the self of thought already in control of its objects, that's empiricism or echoism, but the active constitution of the new object makes the explicit and articulate what was until then presented as no more than indeterminate arises.

309
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,360
Well, I don't know yet.

310
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:23,160
You can see why I well, I'll get anyway.

311
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,479
You can see why it's confusing.

312
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:27,959
Which object is he going to be talking about?

313
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:31,320
He could be saying, well, aha.

314
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,199
Now I'll tell you why I think this, man, I'll let him talk.

315
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:56,640
If you were talking about the kinds of objects that you've got when you are responding to affordances, which is, is he talking about how thanks to the way the body works, we can see affordances, floors that we walk on and food that we eat, and it just calls to us and we respond?

316
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:02,559
Or is he talking about the way we see objects when we're seeing them as subconclusive properties?

317
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:12,319
Well, I think what I thought this morning, and I certainly not read you get it up, is that attention must have to do with seeing objects as objects.

318
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:19,279
You're not attending to things when your arm goes out to them to eat them, or when you walk out the door and the floor affords stepping.

319
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:24,719
You wouldn't put the discovery of affordances in the chapter on attention.

320
00:32:24,719 --> 00:32:30,559
Affordances are exactly what show up for you when you've got your mind on getting to work.

321
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,719
The floor with its affording walking doesn't get your attention.

322
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:40,559
When I'm lently, the last thing that has my attention is the electron and its properties.

323
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:50,880
But I think, and so the question I asked myself this morning was, why is he bringing them this far under attention, since I've always thought he was only interested in affordances?

324
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,279
Okay?

325
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:57,119
I think what he wants to emphasize is that attention is like there's tens of types of attention.

326
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,680
I'm trying to get that.

327
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,799
It's just happening all the time.

328
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:06,959
And I think what he wants to say is that, you know, he said here, the first operation of attention is that you're creating for itself a feel.

329
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:09,839
So it's a phenomenal feel that he wants to get at.

330
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,959
And then there's this phenomenon.

331
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:19,920
So that's why he, I think that's why he mentions this particular case of the of that person you're being figuring bigger, right?

332
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:25,359
Because there you're getting the the kind of sensations without the field, because the purpose we have stuff.

333
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,160
Okay, good.

334
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:37,559
But when you do create the field, then it looks like it's a question of stepping back and creating something new with advanced, you think that's all the coping story.

335
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,839
No, no, but you don't have that.

336
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,400
You're in the field.

337
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,039
That's the point.

338
00:33:40,199 --> 00:33:40,920
That happened.

339
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,279
You're the field when you're coping.

340
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:44,999
You're my feeling when you're natural higher to get observations.

341
00:33:44,999 --> 00:33:48,519
Okay, and why would attention be necessary to create a field?

342
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:49,640
Why would you call that attention?

343
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,239
A lot of people want to talk about him talk.

344
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:51,959
I'm sorry.

345
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:52,759
I've been filled up.

346
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:54,439
You weren't saying something a while back, right?

347
00:33:54,439 --> 00:33:55,239
Okay, I imagine.

348
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:01,160
Oh, well, I was maybe a dose of intentionality with the representation.

349
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,519
Intentionality.

350
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:04,519
Well, I don't want to talk about that.

351
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,319
No people are looking for the mask.

352
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,080
No, I don't think that's working about.

353
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:26,919
No, I don't think that is that's that although I can see why you say that because when if if you were giving our us a giving a description of objects somehow independent of our purposes and so forth, then maybe but now that only makes me would make me confused.

354
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:27,319
Right.

355
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:30,759
More of a question about how you might think about this.

356
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:49,239
If you think about the process by which you become capable of skillful coping, from applying example learning to swim, there's a point in the process of becoming capable of thematize or attend to the aspect of something like how to breathe.

357
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:50,600
Yeah, that's how you have to do it.

358
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:50,999
Right.

359
00:34:51,480 --> 00:35:07,799
And it seems like that there is some continuum there between the way you focus in on the actual kind of techniques of using the body, and then gradually over time begins to fade into the background and make constitute kind of the phenomenal field of same activity.

360
00:35:08,919 --> 00:35:09,719
Maybe.

361
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:16,639
I mean, I don't want to do it in terms of coping skill if I can help it because he's talking about proceeding right now.

362
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:22,879
And in proceeding you don't start with the rules and the features.

363
00:35:22,879 --> 00:35:25,279
Now don't let me that doesn't make me happy either.

364
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,159
I'm sorry.

365
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,719
I just got to figure that out I got to suckle this through on my own.

366
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:29,039
Yeah.

367
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,880
I know he goes into the learning to see colors.

368
00:35:48,879 --> 00:35:55,519
And that but I don't think the learning to see colors is the crucial thing here.

369
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,039
Let me find my quotes and then you guys can come back with your quotes.

370
00:36:01,279 --> 00:36:04,079
I want to why do I think this?

371
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,599
Where is my list?

372
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:11,120
Okay, I'm 34 and 35 of the figures quote.

373
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:17,839
I want to say it creates an experience of the objective perceptual world, 362.

374
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,640
If this doesn't fit this, I'm in bad trouble.

375
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,359
So let me see.

376
00:36:22,399 --> 00:36:23,999
This is the paragraph again.

377
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,239
Well, it's right before the paragraph that begins.

378
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:28,320
Intellectualism sets out.

379
00:36:28,879 --> 00:36:32,159
So now I'm going to read this and see whether whether it helped me or not.

380
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:43,920
If God reflections makes us put the world of the exact back into the cradle of consciousness and ask how the very idea of a world of exact truth is possible.

381
00:36:43,919 --> 00:36:46,000
This is in this attention set.

382
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,279
And that seems to fit what I want to say.

383
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,959
And look for its first appearance in consciousness.

384
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:59,239
When I look quite freely and naturally, the various parts of the field interact and motivate the enormous moon on the horizon.

385
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:05,719
And then he goes back to the beginning part of the experience.

386
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:14,680
But let's consciousness must be faced with its own unreflected light and things and awaken to its own history, which it has been forgetting.

387
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:23,719
Such is the true part of that philosophical the true part that philosophical reflection has to play and to arrive at a true theory of attention.

388
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:40,600
Now, I read that to say the true theory of attention has got to explain how we get from the holistic stuff like the moon on the horizon to a world in which there is determinate exact food.

389
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:44,520
What's this idea of the world of exact truth becoming possible within the moon?

390
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:49,479
He just wants to clarify how we get the prejudice of determinate gaining.

391
00:37:49,799 --> 00:37:50,680
There's something to it.

392
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:51,239
Right.

393
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,479
Attention seems to have something to do with it.

394
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,239
I think the beginning of the wonderful thing.

395
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,480
Yes, where are the questions?

396
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:08,120
Now attention has to be conceived on the model of the primary act.

397
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:15,560
Then secondary attention, which would be limited to recalling knowledge already gained, would want more identifying, identifying with acquisition.

398
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,079
So paying attention is not merely vertical, we say pre-existing data.

399
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,839
It is to bring all of the articulation.

400
00:38:20,919 --> 00:38:23,079
So I mean, that's your quote.

401
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:30,279
I just want, I just think that he wants to say that there is the attention of our coping, which creates a phenomenal field.

402
00:38:30,799 --> 00:38:36,199
And then that within this field, a transformation can happen when I make a scientific observation.

403
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:38,839
Okay, but that doesn't just any old observation.

404
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:39,799
It doesn't have to be.

405
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,640
I observe this thing here that has these properties.

406
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,279
The objective that he wants to get at.

407
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:53,999
And so now he feels like, aha, now we can account for how you got the idea of the prejudice of determining being defined.

408
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:54,799
That's right.

409
00:38:55,279 --> 00:38:57,280
I think we're saying the same thing.

410
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:09,360
What he needs to explain is why we think that there's this objective world that has these betterly determinate properties when the perceptual world never has complete determinate properties.

411
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:14,000
And he wants to attribute that to a certain kind of attention.

412
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,719
That's what I'm saying.

413
00:39:16,799 --> 00:39:32,959
Well, it's the result of, yes, of a certain kind of attention to see fatal determinate objects, which then we inevitably, that's another piece of the argument, make the mistake of thinking we're there all along and explain why we saw them.

414
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:39,199
And then if you throw in the experience error, you try to explain perception and attention from the objective right.

415
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,399
And you can't do that.

416
00:39:40,399 --> 00:39:41,120
Then you give up.

417
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:51,920
But at least what I'm trying to see here is, and I think it's here, is he has to have a story about why we do see objects with determinant properties.

418
00:39:51,919 --> 00:40:01,360
And I think he's putting it in here in the attention chapter rightly, because we do have a way of paying attention to things which turns them into objects.

419
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:10,000
And he needs that to explain why people overlook the area the level that he's really interested in.

420
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,159
And what's the level he's really interested in is affordances, you remember.

421
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:25,600
Where our normal way of perceiving is not to look at things, observe them as objects, but to cope with them and and and respond to their solicitations.

422
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,080
That's right.

423
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,279
Yeah, but he doesn't talk about affordances or solicitations.

424
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:36,120
What he's focusing on here is the whole tension between the determinate and the indeterminate.

425
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:42,039
And kind of the perception and the point of exploration creates the determinate.

426
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:42,600
Right.

427
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,519
And it creates it now, we want to say, in sort of two stages.

428
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:57,159
I mean, the one stage is where the child finally creates the colors, and the next stage is where grown-ups see the objects with qualities and secondary properties, I think.

429
00:40:57,879 --> 00:40:58,279
Yeah.

430
00:40:58,919 --> 00:41:14,040
I think there's also an interesting connection with the criticism of intellectualism and empiricism that kind of clung a little bit earlier, where he says that empiricism cannot see that we need to know what we're looking for, otherwise we wouldn't be looking for it.

431
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,160
And intellectualism fails to see that we need to be ignorant.

432
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:31,239
So the idea being that there is something right that they're both sort of going after with these stable determinate objects, but what they don't see is that, as with affordances, something needs to be constituted in a way.

433
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:40,839
So I think he's sort of acknowledging, like you said, that there is this determinate object that we need to take account of, but really it all leads back to what he's going to say is more.

434
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:57,400
Yeah, he wants to explain, remember, both be empiricists with their impressions, and if we ever get there, the intellectualist who also has the same view that there is some determinant something or others which we have to put together and give meaning to.

435
00:41:57,399 --> 00:42:00,600
And then we have to explain where they got this idea.

436
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,519
And then he's got this two-fold story.

437
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:12,440
Well, they've got this idea because we have a kind of attention which makes objects appear to be completely stable and determinate with fixed qualities.

438
00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:20,399
And then because we can do that, we assume that, again, it's the searchlight idea.

439
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:29,520
But when we do that, we assume, well, it's been like that all along, and we're just finally seeing that all it really is, basically, is this world of determinate objects.

440
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,640
And now he wants to say, no, that's not how it is.

441
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:37,840
That's something we've, quote, created, better to say, composed.

442
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:44,799
It's one of the ways that we can organize that our one of the ways that our experience organizes itself.

443
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:47,359
By the way, let me say something about that.

444
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:57,119
It's always, to be put not in the terms of us, you know, synthesizing it or constituting it or anything like that.

445
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,719
It's always on the side of experience.

446
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:02,000
There are two ways that our experience organizes itself.

447
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,719
When we're involved, it organizes itself into affordances.

448
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:18,640
And when we take a more detached attitude and step back from our ongoing activity, it organizes itself into substances with properties.

449
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:25,919
And then we read back, this is what you were just saying, as if that was all along there, substances with properties.

450
00:43:25,919 --> 00:43:27,680
And that's the experience error.

451
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:33,600
And that leaves you only with two possibilities: the empiricist story or the intellectualist story.

452
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:40,719
How did this stuff that were just substances with properties ever get to be perceptual objects?

453
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:42,399
Don't think about that for a moment.

454
00:43:43,279 --> 00:43:44,559
Yeah, let me go on.

455
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,479
Maybe because I want to cover more.

456
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:48,719
The algorithm fake up in a few minutes ago.

457
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,799
I could wait till lunch.

458
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,360
Okay, let me see now where we are.

459
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,560
So there's an objective world, and let me just give my own text.

460
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,319
Let me just have one comment.

461
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,160
Let me just create something and give some more.

462
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:03,959
Not my full time, it's my whole time.

463
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,039
I think really right.

464
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:12,520
The distinction that matters here is between the determinant and the indeterminate that I've experienced now.

465
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:16,920
Whereas the contrast between the facts when you engage is really not in thought.

466
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:27,960
And the reason why that matters is so much otherwise when I look, when I give my focused attention to the left gentleman, the fellow behind it is out of focus.

467
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,719
I can turn my attention to him and now he's in focus.

468
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,320
When he's in focus, this becomes background.

469
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:40,600
And that's the military contest because it is that sort of creative process of making out there.

470
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,559
All along, if you're asking me, what am I seeing?

471
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,479
I don't think of myself as seeing a blurred room.

472
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,239
I think of myself as seeing a personally determined room.

473
00:44:49,879 --> 00:44:54,280
Yeah, that's what he's going to be most interested in.

474
00:44:54,279 --> 00:45:05,399
But that alone wouldn't get you, what if we call it the world of the completely determinate world of science, this quote I was reading on 35, the idea of a world of exact truth.

475
00:45:05,399 --> 00:45:17,080
You've got to go one step beyond the way you can bring the background out of this figure on some background or change it and make that figure background on some other for some other figure.

476
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,800
You've got to be able to go beyond that.

477
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:31,559
And then you can go to the point of just seeing an isolated thing and in all of its determinatives.

478
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,640
Well, I just don't want to get stuck on that.

479
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:34,600
One last thing.

480
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:40,760
That that explanation is in the right direction, but hasn't gone far enough to explain what Mary LeBlanc is trying to get at.

481
00:45:40,759 --> 00:45:41,839
Have I said that or you're saying that?

482
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,799
Are you suggesting that?

483
00:45:43,759 --> 00:45:57,440
Yeah, I'm saying I agree with Alva that the context here and with Rick is to explain how it is that we get the illusion that there is a completely determinate world of impressions or whatever.

484
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:03,120
And the end the answer's got to be that it's us or even that's not what I want to say.

485
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:16,239
It's the way experience organizes itself that if we pay attention a certain way, we get determinate objects and that that's and then it looks like that must have been there all along.

486
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:18,560
That's the always research light error.

487
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:26,719
And but it's all in the interest of explaining why we've got the problem that empiricists and intellectualists are trying to solve.

488
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:31,039
Now I'm going to go on to the problem that intellectuals are trying to solve.

489
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,640
I have to go back to the drawing board and see if I can find more evidence for what I'm saying.

490
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,000
But I haven't given it up.

491
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,680
I just feel I have a right not to be convinced.

492
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,760
So now let me see where I am.

493
00:46:41,759 --> 00:46:46,640
Okay, we're ready for judgment, which starts on 37 in this book.

494
00:46:47,279 --> 00:46:55,359
And the paragraph that begins at the top of 37, intellectualism, intellectualism set out, it is true to discover.

495
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:57,120
32.

496
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,040
Do you want to explain motives?

497
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,080
I've got motivation.

498
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:04,560
I was going to skip it, but see if I want to do it.

499
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,080
Is this time I would say motivate in five?

500
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:13,600
Yeah, I think it's going to because it's going to come up again later a lot at the end of the chapter.

501
00:47:13,759 --> 00:47:15,199
Let's wait until we get there.

502
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:21,199
I I could I think we should jump to this or we won't have any new material on our, you have to think about it.

503
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:21,760
Okay.

504
00:47:21,759 --> 00:47:30,360
The the judgment is going to fill in what sensation lacks to make perception of objects possible.

505
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:32,840
That's an italic in the beginning.

506
00:47:32,839 --> 00:47:36,919
And that's pretty straightforward, and that's the whole story.

507
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,719
And there's all kinds of variations of it.

508
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:54,760
There has to be some kind of given, some kind of, in Kant language, given to the intuition, that is some kind of passively received, meaningless data.

509
00:47:54,759 --> 00:48:02,680
And then the mind, and this is the why they're intellectualists, has to put some kind of organization on that.

510
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:07,239
It doesn't just organize by association.

511
00:48:07,239 --> 00:48:12,280
It organizes by being brought under, to talk like Kant, categories.

512
00:48:12,279 --> 00:48:25,480
That is, if you want to bring it more sort of down to the lectern, to see the lectern, I've got to see, and then I have a whole complicated, Kant would call it an empirical concept.

513
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,160
My teacher, C.I.

514
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,919
Lewis, called it a meaning in mind.

515
00:48:28,919 --> 00:48:33,960
The meaning of this thing is that if I put books on it, it will support them.

516
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,680
If I look at the other side, it'll have another side.

517
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,719
If I turn the light up a certain way, the color will change a certain way.

518
00:48:42,279 --> 00:48:56,760
You've got a whole mental construct that you put on the basic minimal meaningless experience, and then you could experience it as something or other.

519
00:48:56,759 --> 00:49:03,880
And it doesn't matter here whether it's an electron that affords putting papers on or electron that's got certain properties.

520
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:12,560
The whole thing is to get any kind of perceptual object out of the basic stuff.

521
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:18,640
Now, I want to just sort of fill you in to how sort of manifold this is.

522
00:49:18,799 --> 00:49:28,239
I mean, the basic stuff could be something like sense impressions, that they need to be organized by these categories or needings in mind.

523
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,199
What C.I.

524
00:49:29,279 --> 00:49:35,119
Lewis thought the basic stuff was was indubitable data like seeming to see electron.

525
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:42,159
And the seeming to see electron had to be filled out by, if I do such and such, I'll seem to see the other side.

526
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,520
And if I put pages on it, I'll see they will seem to be supported.

527
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:52,880
And he did it all in terms of seeming because he wanted to, he was still believing that there had to be an indubitable given.

528
00:49:52,879 --> 00:49:54,080
And then there's Husserl.

529
00:49:54,239 --> 00:50:06,160
Husserl got himself into the very interesting position, very sensible and logical, that if order is going to be put in by the mind, what's it going to start with that needs to be ordered?

530
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:17,120
Well, Kant had this mysterious notion of a synopsis, which was wired with synthesis, which gave you the minimal spatial tenfold ordered something of it.

531
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,760
But Lewis, but Husserl doesn't have that.

532
00:50:19,759 --> 00:50:36,799
He gets the notion of what he calls hyletic data, which is completely unstructured matter, perceptual matter, which you have to get the right mental set concept to, he says, no ema, to bring it under.

533
00:50:36,799 --> 00:50:46,399
And there's lots of sort of Husserl in the background in this chapter, probably, at least the intellectualist as Merrill-Pontee is most sort of trying to overthrow it.

534
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,160
I'll give you an example from Husserl because it sort of helps.

535
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,280
What would it be like to have this minimal data?

536
00:50:53,279 --> 00:51:02,760
Well, my favorite example is think of what happens if you think physically as if you're about to get a glass of milk and you get instead a swallow of water.

537
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:09,719
Then it isn't as if you simply switch over and say, oh, milk, I thought it was going to be water.

538
00:51:09,719 --> 00:51:16,199
You get this sort of experience in which you just don't know what is happening to you or what's in your mouth.

539
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:26,840
And then you switch from the mental, from imposing on it the noema or the concept milk to imposing on it the concept water and it all falls into place.

540
00:51:26,839 --> 00:51:34,760
But in that moment with the highlighting data and the highlighted data, there's nothing you can say about it except it sets boundary conditions.

541
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:38,599
It won't accept being taken to be milk if it's water.

542
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,600
And it won't accept to be water data.

543
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,559
And it won't accept to be taken as water data if it's milk data.

544
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:47,239
There is some boundary on what you can take things as.

545
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:54,039
If any structure that you give, that's your mind putting on the structure.

546
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,599
That's what Husserl calls constitution.

547
00:51:56,919 --> 00:52:00,359
And that's the intellectualist view.

548
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:03,399
I want to say one more thing because I know Alva's concerned about this.

549
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:17,800
Hussar an entire, the book is very confusing because it uses the word constitution when it's talking about the intellectualist, and then it means imposing the meaning on the matter, whatever you think the matter is.

550
00:52:17,799 --> 00:52:23,560
And when Merrill-Ponty uses it, it means the self-organizing of experience.

551
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:28,520
So it constitutes itself into a figure on his ground.

552
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,359
And it's very misleading.

553
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:35,160
If you've got to always ask yourself, is this Constitution being done?

554
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,399
Well, there are two levels to that.

555
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:42,680
If the Constitution is being done by the mind, you've certainly got an intellectualist.

556
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:52,080
If the Constitution is being done by the body, then you have a complicated question exactly what that amounts to.

557
00:52:52,080 --> 00:53:00,160
What sort of understanding does the body have that it brings to bear on the data?

558
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,879
Because it could just be, like in C.I.

559
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:15,520
Lewis, what you're bringing to bear is if I move such and such, then such and such, and if I move such and such, then such and such, that would still be intellectual from a narrow-ponty point of view.

560
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:25,360
You only have a right to say from a narrow-ponty point of view that experience constitutes itself as such and such.

561
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:27,600
And it turns out that's correlative with the body.

562
00:53:27,759 --> 00:53:28,800
We'll get to that.

563
00:53:28,799 --> 00:53:33,600
But I think it's important at this stage just to pay attention.

564
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:37,119
I'm going to give you, I'm always trying to give you guidelines for not getting lost.

565
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:40,800
Here's the Constitution guideline.

566
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:45,680
And there's a whole lot of talk about Constitution at one place.

567
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:56,239
Okay, so on 46, which is in the middle of nowhere, I'm afraid, for a few other people, maybe I've got it in my notes in whatever form.

568
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,999
Well, I'm just going to read it.

569
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,079
He's talking about analytic reflection breaks the world in itself.

570
00:54:02,399 --> 00:54:04,160
Breaks the world in itself, 38.

571
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:07,119
He says it constitutes it through the working of consciousness.

572
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:14,800
But this constituting consciousness, instead of being directly apprehended, is built in such a way as to make possible the idea and so forth and so forth.

573
00:54:14,799 --> 00:54:19,760
Constituting consciousness is the intellectualist account.

574
00:54:19,759 --> 00:54:31,000
But here, on page 44, and this is so confusing, Herr's going to do his story and use Constitution, about 15 lines from the bottom of 44 for me.

575
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:47,719
We shall have only an abstract essence of consciousness as long as we refrain from following the actual movement by which it resumes its own operations at every instant, focusing and concentrating them on an indefinable object, gradually passing from seeing to knowing and achieving the unity of its own life.

576
00:54:47,719 --> 00:54:55,799
We shall not reach this constitutive dimension if we replace the plenary unity of consciousness by a complete transparent subject and so forth and so forth.

577
00:54:55,799 --> 00:54:56,999
There he's ready.

578
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,520
This does two jobs.

579
00:54:58,839 --> 00:55:08,360
I think it tells you that he wants to go from, you can go to seeing and then to knowing, and that's the two things we were talking about.

580
00:55:08,359 --> 00:55:14,680
And both of them are constitutive in his sense, self-organizing.

581
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,280
But at the bottom, he starts talking about the other kind of constitution.

582
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,199
Let's see, let me just go on.

583
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:37,959
The intellectual process of self-discovery doesn't penetrate as far as this living nucleus of perception, because it's looking for the conditions which make it possible, without which it would not exist, instead of uncovering the operation which brings it into reality whereby it's constituted.

584
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,600
Now that's still self-organizing.

585
00:55:41,239 --> 00:55:45,079
Let's see if I can find a constitution which is with him.

586
00:55:45,399 --> 00:55:54,040
Well, he talks about on the previous page, about 15 lines down, the domain of the constituted and not of the constituting mind.

587
00:55:54,040 --> 00:56:05,560
When he talks about constituting the mind, then he's not talking about the way the experience achieves its own unity, organizes itself.

588
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:09,400
He's talking about the way the mind imposes order.

589
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:11,479
Now, let me go back because it would be good.

590
00:56:11,879 --> 00:56:39,120
So the intellectualist is talking about the way the mind imposes order, and that could be order on sense data, it could be order on meaning, it could be order on philotic data, but whatever it is, it's some stuff, it's some kind of order which exists independent of this stuff and which is imposed on the stuff and puts it together.

591
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:47,440
And the mental one is the one we want to focus on, because the sense in which the body might or might not do that is too complicated for us yet.

592
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:50,239
So, now I want to see where we are.

593
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,279
Well, I like this passage.

594
00:56:53,279 --> 00:57:05,199
Remember, this is why I keep saying it's an antinome, the intellectualist and the empiricist, right after the italics about judgment is what sensation acts.

595
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:08,080
It adds to what sensational acts makes perception possible.

596
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,519
He goes on a little bit later.

597
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:22,480
Analysis is dominated by the empiricist notion, which, however, is accepted only as the boundary of consciousness and serves merely to throw into a leap a power of coordination of which it is itself the antithesis.

598
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:27,520
That is, the power of coordination is this mental power.

599
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:31,759
And the power of just association is the other.

600
00:57:31,759 --> 00:57:35,759
Intellectualism thrives on a refutation of empiricism.

601
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:47,600
Analytic reflection makes its position firm by carrying to their logical conclusions the realist and empiricist thesis and validating their opposite by showing their absurdity.

602
00:57:47,600 --> 00:58:02,280
So, that's that's so now we're going to get these people who are going to reduce to absurdity the idea that we can get any that blind intuition, as he puts it in the next paragraph, could ever get you anywhere.

603
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:04,199
But you've got to have a concept.

604
00:58:04,759 --> 00:58:16,440
And that judgment is applying these concepts to the given, whatever the stuff is that you're supposed to be organizing.

605
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:26,280
And then perception becomes, as he says, this is before that big footnote.

606
00:58:29,319 --> 00:58:41,719
Perception becomes an interpretation of the signs that our senses provide in accordance with a body's visionalized, a hypothesis that the mind evolves to explain impressions to itself.

607
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:47,719
And judgment explains the excess of perception over the retinal impression.

608
00:58:47,719 --> 00:58:50,360
All of this is just the same point.

609
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:57,160
Another way to put it, and we're now down to about 15 lines on 39, this is what the intellectualist does.

610
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:03,000
We, the intellectualists, construct perception instead of revealing its distinctive working.

611
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,800
We miss the we, just very, the user, but it's not him and us.

612
00:59:07,799 --> 00:59:20,600
We miss once more the basic operation which infuses meaning, sans, that's significance, into the sensible, and which is taken for granted by any logical mediation or any psychological causality.

613
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:23,080
Logical mediation is intellectualist.

614
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,040
Causality is associations.

615
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:29,239
And psychology now doesn't mean Gestalt psychology.

616
00:59:29,239 --> 00:59:30,680
It means behaviors.

617
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:35,079
Whenever you see psychology, you must be getting good at this, I hope.

618
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:42,120
You could have to ask yourself: are these the people who don't understand anything, or are these the Gestaltists who understand it almost completely?

619
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:45,360
So, and now let's see.

620
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:50,080
So, something given and has to be interpreted.

621
00:59:50,080 --> 01:00:10,080
And the one other point I want to get across today is the way you have to understand very clearly that the Mero-Ponty, getting interpreted doesn't mean having some mental belief about what's going on.

622
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:13,680
Getting, sorry, no, that was very wrong.

623
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:20,239
Getting interpreted sounds like there's something about which you have a belief or an interpretation.

624
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:32,079
Mero-Ponty wants to say it's built into the way things look themselves, what affordances they have, for instance.

625
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:37,760
He's talking at the bottom of 39 at the beginning of the paragraph against a large cardboard box.

626
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:48,480
If you look at a large cardboard box, which actually weighs as much as a small one, it will look heavier.

627
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:54,959
You will say that it feels heavier to your hand, and intellectualism can't say that.

628
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:59,360
And then he's got lots of examples of how that works.

629
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,519
And I just wanted to give you sort of my own kind of example, so you have this in mind as you read it.

630
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:23,600
Because the way to see that this intellectualism is wrong is to see this intellectualism has to presuppose something which it then interprets, and then you have some kind of meaningful experience.

631
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:27,600
And what Mero-Monty wants to say is that it's not an interpretation.

632
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:36,520
Things look different depending on what you are coping with them as.

633
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:40,920
Yeah, what let me just give you two examples.

634
01:01:40,919 --> 01:01:49,879
I mean, if you he he thinks, and I think it's right, that if you look at a house from the front and you think it's a house, it looks thick.

635
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:54,680
Remember I've said this several times already, that you can go in through the front door and so forth.

636
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:01,880
And if you think that it's a facade, it looks flat and like you can't go in through the front door.

637
01:02:01,879 --> 01:02:14,199
Now, what I'm adding to that, having said that lots of times, there's no percept, there's no impression, there's no data that stays the same and gets two different interpretations.

638
01:02:14,199 --> 01:02:17,160
That's the view that he's trying to refute.

639
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,719
And I think that's the clearest way to refute it.

640
01:02:19,879 --> 01:02:30,759
He's trying with the box example, there's nothing like the blank interpretation of the box as just a box, and then you interpret it as heavy or light.

641
01:02:30,759 --> 01:02:34,120
No, it looks heavy or it looks light.

642
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:40,120
Now, I don't know if you believe this about the houses, but I'll tell you how I came to believe it.

643
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:44,600
I mean, I remember the day that I was switched out of seeing a C.I.

644
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:58,519
Lewis follower who would have said, well, it's got some particular look, and that, and then you interpret it as a facade, or you interpret it as a house, but your interpretation doesn't change how it looks.

645
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:03,399
Your interpretation just changes whether you take it to be a facade or a house.

646
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:09,160
Now Fonte wants to say, no, what you take it to be changes how it looks.

647
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:19,280
And that's, in fact, you could say, once you're in sort of in a certain involved way, the way it looks determines what you take it to be.

648
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:24,879
So that when you're on a movie set, all of the things look flat and you therefore take them to be facades.

649
01:03:24,879 --> 01:03:28,479
And when you're on the street, all the things look like houses that you could walk into.

650
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:31,359
So you take them to be houses, how they look.

651
01:03:31,759 --> 01:03:32,799
Here's what happened to me.

652
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:34,239
It's sort of a crazy story.

653
01:03:34,239 --> 01:03:55,040
I was going down Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley when I first came to Berkeley way back in 68, and I saw what I took to be a beautiful woman in front of me, and I just walked faster to see how she looked from the other side, how she said she was looking so nice from the back with long hair and all that.

654
01:03:55,040 --> 01:04:02,880
And what I found was when I got around that this beautiful woman was a man with a beard and a mustache.

655
01:04:02,879 --> 01:04:04,559
And this was a shock.

656
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:10,560
And then, that was totally uninteresting, I fell behind again.

657
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:14,640
And now that didn't look anymore like the back of the beautiful woman.

658
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,960
That looked like the back of a man.

659
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:25,520
And there wasn't any determinate impression which I had interpreted in two different ways.

660
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:34,160
That's when I saw that Lewis was wrong, and when I saw that Marilo Funty had a very important point that we had to pay more attention to.

661
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:37,359
And you can make up interesting stories, which I think are important.

662
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:39,039
How did the back look here?

663
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:43,520
Well, I don't remember Marilyn Funcy talking about this, but I worry about this.

664
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:51,600
I think it's because the shoulders now look important to me, maybe more than the hips, and stuff like that.

665
01:04:51,759 --> 01:04:55,599
You can make it, you could, what stands out is significant.

666
01:04:55,600 --> 01:05:02,120
So, with the house, I think, if it's a facade, you'll see the sort of blank glitters on the windows.

667
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:06,919
Whereas if you think it's a house, you'll think you see the furniture inside the windows.

668
01:05:06,919 --> 01:05:13,320
You'll pay attention either to the glitter or to the furniture, depending on whether you think it's a facade or the house.

669
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:16,760
So, it isn't magical.

670
01:05:17,719 --> 01:05:18,919
It looks different.

671
01:05:18,919 --> 01:05:24,199
It isn't as if you just interpreted it that way.

672
01:05:24,199 --> 01:05:24,999
And that's okay.

673
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:32,999
Now, having said that, we want to get back to so there isn't a given that gets interpreted.

674
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,440
That's where we are.

675
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,719
We're at the top of 39.

676
01:05:37,719 --> 01:05:44,840
It's not, perception is a hypothesis which explains the impression.

677
01:05:44,839 --> 01:05:48,360
Because I'm just going to repeat my point once more, because I think it's so important.

678
01:05:48,359 --> 01:05:59,080
There is no neutral impression that is there both in the back of the man and in the back of the woman, or in the facade in the house.

679
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:09,160
You know, it can't be that we are interpreting this, our mind is taking this impression two different ways.

680
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:23,400
It can't even be, I think, but again, I say this is a difficult question that I'm not ready to talk about yet, that you can't even understand what he means by the body as something that manages to take this impression in two different ways.

681
01:06:23,399 --> 01:06:32,600
Because he thinks that if you think there's any impression at all that gets interpreted by the mind or the body, you've already made the mistake.

682
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:35,799
So, but he's interested in the intellectualist view.

683
01:06:35,799 --> 01:06:41,160
He hasn't really thought about it, I think, but I think it's a great thing to try to think about.

684
01:06:41,399 --> 01:06:46,239
When you bring in, how you bring in the body will make a big difference in this.

685
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:48,080
But I'll do that later.

686
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:48,719
Let me see now.

687
01:06:48,719 --> 01:07:00,479
I want to do the 39 we just did 40 at the bottom of 39, the back the cardboard box story.

688
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:01,920
Okay, we've done that.

689
01:07:01,919 --> 01:07:07,199
And now we're going to go on to, well, I just like this phrase at the next page.

690
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:14,400
He says we have to apprehend an imminent sense in the sensible before judgment begins.

691
01:07:14,399 --> 01:07:23,520
That's just another way of saying it's not a neutral impression that gets judged one way or another by being brought under one concept or another.

692
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,719
There's already a meaning, and that's rock-bottom.

693
01:07:26,719 --> 01:07:29,839
You don't go, you can't get behind that.

694
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:34,239
Now let's see, there's another one I wanted to show you.

695
01:07:34,239 --> 01:07:38,800
Okay, at the top of 45, I don't know how I'm going to tell you how to get to that one.

696
01:07:43,919 --> 01:07:45,359
No footnotes either.

697
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:46,879
I don't know, maybe you'll find it.

698
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:53,359
It's right back when I talked about constituted, where I said that it's self-organized.

699
01:07:53,600 --> 01:08:03,600
Right after that, right after where I read that there's the operations which bring things into reality whereby it's constituted.

700
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:11,040
Well, constituted now means, if the Christ I was reading, remember, organized by itself, not given a meaning.

701
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:13,199
This is the anti-intellectual view.

702
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:17,039
In actual perception, that's his view.

703
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:26,079
Taken at its origin before any word is uttered, the sign offered to sense and the signification are not even theoretically separable.

704
01:08:26,079 --> 01:08:34,600
That is, you cannot carve out anything in common between the back of the girl and the back of the guy, between the house and the facade.

705
01:08:34,919 --> 01:08:42,119
You can't find the part that needs to be interpreted and the part that's the interpretation.

706
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:47,399
That's his basic view, and he just keeps hammering away at it.

707
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:52,919
I don't know if I need to tell you anything more, just because I think I got 30 minutes left.

708
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:58,999
Well, I was going to tell you some things, maybe I will, about what not to pay too much attention to.

709
01:08:58,999 --> 01:08:59,640
Let's try that.

710
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:03,159
I'll tell you things for the last three minutes to help you with your reading.

711
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:15,560
There is all the sort of criticism of Gestalt's psychology at the end, about five pages in from the end, when intellectualism took over the naturalistic notion of sensation.

712
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,440
This is a paragraph.

713
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:20,359
It begins with that long footnote on Descartes, which I said you didn't have to read.

714
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:29,959
Remember, I said you didn't have to read the whole Descartes thing, which goes from 48 to 53.

715
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:36,759
And at the top of 53, you really ought to start reading again, but not with the kind of concentration.

716
01:09:36,759 --> 01:09:48,520
It gets, because what he's doing, he says, conversely now that psychology discards the notion of sensation and so forth and brings it and has a criticism of the conflict hypothesis.

717
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:50,839
Of course, that's Gestalt's psychology.

718
01:09:50,839 --> 01:09:55,239
Then he has a lot of criticism to give of Gestalt's psychology.

719
01:09:55,240 --> 01:10:02,199
And that's something, since you don't know Gestalt's psychology, you don't, I don't think you have to worry about it.

720
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:12,159
And it's got to do with whether they whether they believe too much in causality and too much in the real world, whether they're looking for a causal basis of the Gestalt phenomena.

721
01:10:11,959 --> 01:10:15,199
So you can skip clear up to the end.

722
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:19,280
Do you think they can read that?

723
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:24,319
I think it's very important to see that Miliponi's not basically defelled psychology.

724
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:24,640
Okay.

725
01:10:25,119 --> 01:10:30,719
And that his criticism doesn't have, well, basically that metaphysical consequence that will come out later.

726
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:30,879
Okay.

727
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,640
Granted, it will come out later.

728
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:33,839
Rick is right about that.

729
01:10:33,839 --> 01:10:36,879
But read it in a way, don't get too worried about it.

730
01:10:36,879 --> 01:10:39,999
I mean, I agree about that, because you must not know Gisela psychology.

731
01:10:39,999 --> 01:10:40,560
You can't.

732
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:41,759
Oh, you don't do heard this.

733
01:10:41,999 --> 01:10:44,400
Well, yeah, he knows a lot about Gisela psychology.

734
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,759
He's got a vested interest in this.

735
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:47,520
He's got stock in Genfelt psychology.

736
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:54,319
And I think that the Geshell psychologist shouldn't do anything wrong.

737
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,799
They've just been granted stresses because of naturalism.

738
01:10:56,959 --> 01:10:58,640
Yeah, but so is Gibson, for instance.

739
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,480
Well, no, Gibson's a thing.

740
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:04,879
Okay, well, yeah, but Gibson is what the development psychologist should have been.

741
01:11:04,879 --> 01:11:05,119
Right.

742
01:11:06,079 --> 01:11:10,079
And that's a little nice thing to be saying, but they should have been by suffering out what they got off.

743
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:12,719
Yeah, oh, yeah, but Gibson's a naturalist anyway, though.

744
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:13,839
No?

745
01:11:14,079 --> 01:11:14,959
Woo!

746
01:11:14,959 --> 01:11:15,280
Woo!

747
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:16,239
I'm going to talk about that.

748
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:17,680
First doctor of the book.

749
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:18,799
Okay, never mind.

750
01:11:18,799 --> 01:11:31,520
Let me go back to reading you one thing at the bottom of 56, which is three pages from the end of the section, which you now, according to Rick, and I think I will go along with him.

751
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,159
You could be.

752
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:38,560
Let me just tell you, by the way, remember that did I tell you not to read 36 to 39?

753
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:43,439
Or did not not to read it, but that it wasn't gifted to the list.

754
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:47,959
Another place where it's not Meryl-Ponty talking to a lot of it.

755
01:11:47,959 --> 01:11:49,119
Let me tell you that.

756
01:11:51,280 --> 01:12:01,079
In the middle of 36, it's where he starts with if the moon on the horizon still so forcibly brings out.

757
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:09,079
That's about 20 lines there, which cutting it switches into the not his view of the picture.

758
01:12:09,079 --> 01:12:24,520
And I want you to say, yeah, and all of 37, 38, and 39, up to the bottom of 39, up to the large cardboard box, is him getting inside of and explaining the intellectualist position.

759
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:28,520
So you should read it for sure, but you shouldn't think that it's his position.

760
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,039
That's very important.

761
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,999
And one more thing about that, and then I'm going to go on.

762
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:39,959
I told you that you could skip 43 to 44.

763
01:12:40,999 --> 01:12:43,719
Not being him really begins on 42.

764
01:12:44,039 --> 01:12:56,119
Starting with the paragraph, it is true that at the bottom of 42 to the middle of 44, where it says negative power, that's not him.

765
01:12:56,119 --> 01:13:01,640
I was told by so many people that it was helpful to tell you this that I figured I'd better go on telling them.

766
01:13:02,839 --> 01:13:06,119
And now, I guess, yeah, time is up.

767
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:07,560
I wanted to do that.

768
01:13:08,119 --> 01:13:16,039
And now we're going to go on and do the phenomenal field for, where are we?

769
01:13:16,039 --> 01:13:20,039
We're supposed to, you're supposed to read up to 59 today, and that's where I got it.

770
01:13:20,039 --> 01:13:24,759
And now we're going to go on and look at the part called the phenomenal field for next time.

771
01:13:24,759 --> 01:13:26,439
The reading is pretty short.

772
01:13:26,999 --> 01:13:28,360
You need a short reading now.

773
01:13:28,839 --> 01:13:29,560
Okay.
