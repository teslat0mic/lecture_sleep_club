1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,081
So column A is the tasking cogito.

2
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:14,320
B is something like the regular cogito.

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,280
And then there's the Cartesian cogito.

4
00:00:17,441 --> 00:00:35,280
I now think that this found this, and in here is all the pre-linguistic, pre-reflective, motor-intentional, impersonal, engaged, and a kind of background, namely the background of the perceptual constants.

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,720
And in this is language.

6
00:00:38,721 --> 00:00:40,960
And so these are the same things I had on the board before.

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,280
A big one here, perception I didn't.

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,560
And here is thought, language, reflection, representational intentionality.

9
00:00:48,561 --> 00:00:51,840
I think I forgot the name motor intentionality over here.

10
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,080
The impersonal ones, one thinks in English or there isn't even any thinking.

11
00:00:58,081 --> 00:01:01,440
The one organizes the world in my body schema.

12
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:03,040
And here's the I think.

13
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,560
This is engaged.

14
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,641
This is sort of disengaged.

15
00:01:06,641 --> 00:01:10,880
I mean, on a background that's still always engaged.

16
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,840
And then there's the Cartesian cogito, which is supposedly self-sufficient.

17
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:35,321
But if you want to say that this founds this in a way that I'll try to explain, and this founds this, to say that this founds this is to say this doesn't really exist, because the Cartesian coge claims that it isn't founded on anything.

18
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:36,921
It's the foundation of everything.

19
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,680
So that's part of the puzzle.

20
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:50,600
I mean, there is something going on over here doing geometry and maybe even formal kinds of geometry and formal kinds of arithmetic.

21
00:01:50,601 --> 00:01:53,481
And there may be a kind of certainty in that.

22
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:55,000
I imagine there is.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,201
That what there can't be over here is something whose meaning is self-sufficient and in it.

24
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:06,440
It's always on the background of something else.

25
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:17,801
In this case, this is on the background of the sedimented institution and history of geometry, to take the geometry example.

26
00:02:17,801 --> 00:02:30,440
You can't just do geometry in a vacuum, and you never get the whole background clear and explicit and self-justifying or by or defined.

27
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,960
So, and this, to say something is founded, it's important.

28
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:48,120
And it was pointed out to me that the crucial, nice passage is on 459 in here, where we should read all this.

29
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,520
About eight lines from the bottom.

30
00:02:52,520 --> 00:03:07,240
If it were possible to lay bare and unfold all the presuppositions in what I call my reason or my idea at each moment, we should always find experiences which have not been made explicit, if it were possible, if we had to try.

31
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,960
We'd always find experiences which had not been made explicit.

32
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:17,040
That's the point about Descartes isn't, Cartesian thinking isn't self-sufficient.

33
00:03:17,361 --> 00:03:28,081
Large-scale contributions from past and present, a whole sedimented history, which is not only relevant to the genesis of my thought, but which determines its significance.

34
00:03:28,081 --> 00:03:37,120
Founding is determining the significance or the meaning, according to Lois Roll, and I'm sure that's also according to Merillo Ponte.

35
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:49,361
So to say that this founds this is that none of these squiggles over here would have any meaning if it weren't for our experience of, say, triangles.

36
00:03:49,361 --> 00:04:02,401
And you wouldn't be able to carry on all these supposed logical operations except on a background which has always got more in it, taken more for granted than you could imagine.

37
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,361
Now, let's see, 458.

38
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:15,521
Now, I think that it was a red herring on 458 to worry about this business of what's made manifest.

39
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:26,721
I don't think that being made manifest is an important part of founding, though it does come in at the end of that list.

40
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,801
I don't think it's wrong.

41
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:43,361
What it says, what it means is that there are the capacities over here that get made manifest over here, like the infant learning language.

42
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:45,041
But that all sounds genetic.

43
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:54,961
And there is no doubt that this, we talked about this, this infant animal thing develops into this grown-up human being coming to saying.

44
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,201
And that but that's not the interesting relation, I think.

45
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:04,761
The founding relation is that what goes on here presupposes for its significance.

46
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:27,080
That is language, reflection, representational intentionality, thinking, disengagement, and so forth, all presuppose that you've got a world that's been opened up, that has stable objects in it, that has meanings in it already, and a kind of intentionality in it already, and that that is what bounds, and that's the only word for it.

47
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,161
I don't want to say it makes possible.

48
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:46,601
It would be better to say that it's an enabling condition if you had to say something, because Nero Ponty sometimes says that I think that this is the condition of the but he also sometimes says that this is the condition of the possibility of this, so it's hard to sort it out.

49
00:05:46,601 --> 00:06:03,240
But I think the safest thing is to say that this gets its significance and meaning from being a development or articulation, or that's where manifestation comes in, if you want to say that, manifestation of this.

50
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:09,080
Only I think manifestation is somehow hard to why that would be the right word.

51
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,120
Now I think I may have said everything I want to say about this.

52
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:14,120
Yeah.

53
00:06:17,161 --> 00:06:18,041
Okay.

54
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:18,601
Yeah.

55
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:24,760
I'm I'm puzzled about what's left of Steve, um, what he was there.

56
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:32,841
And and I just before you say what's left Steve says, I'm I'm kinda puzzled about what's supposed to go in.

57
00:06:32,921 --> 00:06:37,641
I think well, and just to give an example, you might just talk about some of the yeah.

58
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:45,120
But you might think that a paradigm example is formal capacity would be the testimony of capacity.

59
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:47,200
But of course, we don't think that the test value.

60
00:06:47,521 --> 00:06:50,080
No, you're mixing up analytic and formal.

61
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:58,320
When I say formal, I mean who's the Hilbert please the Hilbert project of making all these definitions and squiggles and drawing things and squiggles.

62
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,560
Well, but one could think of the manipulation of a calculator as I could version terms of the word.

63
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,240
It might not be the formal activity.

64
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,680
No, no, no, no, they don't look up.

65
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,881
It's an intuitive thing, a perceptual thing.

66
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,561
It's the furthest from formal.

67
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,601
I mean, test grandmasters don't really calculate at all.

68
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,321
You know that.

69
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,921
So you're tripped to human.

70
00:07:19,921 --> 00:07:30,881
There really is that the end of all the critical assessment, all the different kinds of forms of living and activities, but this is something formal.

71
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:31,760
No.

72
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:43,681
No, no, I don't think so, because I don't think Descartes thought that there was such something formal underlying any of it.

73
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,160
Descartes was a big believer in the intuitive.

74
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:49,280
You know, what I think on the mathematics for example, he is intuitive.

75
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:49,680
Is that?

76
00:07:49,841 --> 00:07:50,240
Yeah, I know.

77
00:07:50,481 --> 00:07:58,401
And what's interesting is, what's complicated about this, and it would be just as well, always right about that, to just cross it out.

78
00:07:58,401 --> 00:07:59,121
We could.

79
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:10,001
Except that Marilotto's him is French and he's got the big that Tartesh and Kokito is something he's got to take on and destroy.

80
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,321
But take seriously before he takes it down.

81
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,761
And I was trying to say that there, well, first till you destroy it.

82
00:08:17,761 --> 00:08:26,281
We just we discovered by saying that there's no indubitable given, that there are no, we don't have transparent access to our feelings.

83
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:33,241
The togi-toe doesn't give you a grounding in the sense of certainty.

84
00:08:33,241 --> 00:08:44,281
And then we say, and about thinking, well, all thinking is really intuitive and thereby borrows its ability to make sense of what it's thinking about from here.

85
00:08:44,281 --> 00:08:47,321
And then if you want to say, well, is there anything over here?

86
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:58,440
The answer is, I think nothing that Descartes thought survives because Descartes thought this was autonomous in the grounding level.

87
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,641
And then the whole point of all this is there's nothing over here that's autonomous and grounding.

88
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:15,881
But I do think, and that's why we can just cross it out or read it in, there is a kind of activity of manipulating a formal calculus in geometry, for instance, and in arithmetic.

89
00:09:17,001 --> 00:09:20,601
And if you want to talk about it, you can.

90
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,000
And if you do, you're going to have to say, though, that it's certainly not self-sufficient.

91
00:09:25,001 --> 00:09:34,281
It's grounded on your background intuition about what it is to make a definition fully, squiggly, formally explicit.

92
00:09:34,521 --> 00:09:36,521
And what's the reason for not putting that indeed?

93
00:09:36,521 --> 00:09:38,201
Because it's children do it.

94
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,880
Ah, children don't do that.

95
00:09:39,881 --> 00:09:40,841
Nobody does.

96
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,601
Nobody tries to make a map to formalize.

97
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,520
It's only AI people trying to do it.

98
00:09:46,521 --> 00:09:48,281
It's something very special.

99
00:09:48,281 --> 00:09:53,641
It's an attempt to really understand perception, but you helped very much with that.

100
00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:05,161
It would not be worth putting anything over here if it weren't for the cognitivists, the real AI people that I worried about years ago, but I've forgotten because they've completely collapsed.

101
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:10,281
But they thought that you could make a formal thing of everything.

102
00:10:10,281 --> 00:10:11,520
That was functionalism.

103
00:10:11,521 --> 00:10:13,041
Fodor believed it.

104
00:10:13,921 --> 00:10:14,881
Lots of philosophers.

105
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,641
Everybody sort of believed it.

106
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:18,640
I don't know where maybe Gennett still believes it.

107
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,320
You probably know better than I.

108
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:29,441
But insofar as anybody thinks that you could run this on a symbolic manipulated computer, that's what's really over.

109
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,760
But you can get some progress.

110
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:35,361
You can try, but it won't ground anything.

111
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,320
It won't do anything that the Cartesian Kogito did.

112
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,520
So why did I bring it up?

113
00:10:39,521 --> 00:10:45,921
Well, just because I wanted to see if there was anything over there, I think it's grounded in this, which is entirely different.

114
00:10:45,921 --> 00:10:55,601
This is an intuitive kind of thinking that is on a background, and nobody thinks you can formalize it.

115
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,641
It can't, this is definitely not computational.

116
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:00,481
This would be computational.

117
00:11:00,801 --> 00:11:05,921
If it wasn't computational, but you know, it's for regards to intuition as formal objects.

118
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:08,721
Yeah, the intuition works for Descartes.

119
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:10,320
As formal objects.

120
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,361
As formal objects.

121
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:12,481
As formal objects.

122
00:11:13,521 --> 00:11:18,080
So, well, for these people, too, computational stuff has primitives.

123
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,081
You couldn't get out, you couldn't do, that's the Wittgenstein tractatis.

124
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,321
You couldn't think these formal things if you didn't have an atomic world.

125
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,960
Now, Descartes's going to have some other variation on it.

126
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,001
Let's not go into it.

127
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:33,361
I'm just going to say, follow what you're saying.

128
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:46,440
So, what you're saying is that rightly understood, no aspects of human life you'll underce, the way computational institutes of pluggnitive mind isn't my these things say I'm doing but that they're under.

129
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:48,960
But that's not even perception for cognitive.

130
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,401
I thought it was unclear last night.

131
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,121
It was.

132
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,401
A lot was unclear last night.

133
00:11:52,881 --> 00:12:03,961
It's much clearer to me now that I have my two columns back and a sense of what's happening is and now I think we can go on uh so I I could have you could have thought about we are bubble.

134
00:12:04,281 --> 00:12:10,680
Okay, so I want to talk about the temporality chapter for the rest of the day and I would be happy to have help from everybody.

135
00:12:10,761 --> 00:12:19,560
I think it's the most confusing and confused chapter of the book and that's really a tough competition to win for Biden's chapters.

136
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:28,680
And my my intuition is that there's something well I will get to that if if I get time at the end.

137
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:52,440
I do think there are two very different uh phenomena in uh in the temporality business and that Husserl is onto one of them and Haydn is onto an entirely different phenomenon and that they are totally and deeply incompatible and that Merlot-Ponty holds on to both of them on in the same paragraph sometimes and therefore it is utterly confusing.

138
00:12:53,161 --> 00:13:21,561
But I think we should do some follow-up positive things before I try to express my negative thing and everything hinges finally on trying to do something which oddly enough in this chapter Merlot-Ponty doesn't really try to do Bulberry or if he does it becomes completely poetic and incomprehensible to me describe the phenomenon of our living in time.

139
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:34,321
It seems to me there's going back to that again a Husserl attempt to do it and then a lot of Merlot-Ponty weird talk, which is his attempt to do it, but I think it's not that hard to describe.

140
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,841
And so I'm going to try to do it.

141
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,481
The first, let's just try what we start from 476.

142
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,960
So he wants the first, we're going to get rid of the first paragraph.

143
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,121
That's not Merloponte.

144
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:54,561
And that leads to a notion of time as a pure sequence of now's.

145
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:07,441
And neither of these two views of temporality, the Heidegger or the Husserl one, think of time as a kind of clock sequence of pure nows.

146
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,841
So we don't have to worry about that one.

147
00:14:10,481 --> 00:14:22,080
And once we try to understand what objective time would be, we discover, and this goes on from 477 to 479, you can't make sense of it.

148
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:34,481
You can't tell whether it flows from the past to the present or whether it comes from what, starts in the future and goes into the past, and so forth.

149
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,481
You've got all these puzzles.

150
00:14:36,481 --> 00:14:42,801
You won't get out of these puzzles about objective time when you understand that time depends on us.

151
00:14:42,801 --> 00:14:49,201
You've got to be situated someplace in time to have a past, present, and future.

152
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:57,521
I think that's like to say that in some way or another there has to be a now for there to be temporality.

153
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:01,841
Just like there has to be a here for there to be spatiality.

154
00:15:02,161 --> 00:15:08,161
And there is no now in objective time, just as there is no here in objective space.

155
00:15:08,161 --> 00:15:12,961
And if there is no now in objective time, then there can't be an earlier and a later than now.

156
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:21,840
And so all the talk about whether time comes from the past or flows to the future or vice versa is gone if there's no earlier or later.

157
00:15:22,161 --> 00:15:29,320
So you can't have a temporality in which there isn't a now, and the only way to get a now into it is for us.

158
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,841
We've got a now.

159
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:36,361
But what the now is or the present is is the hardest thing in the chapter.

160
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:51,001
But we do bring some kind of now and some kind of presence into the otherwise non-temporal reality, if there is such a thing even, which Mirabonte, I think, thinks there isn't.

161
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:52,361
That's all right with me.

162
00:15:52,921 --> 00:16:01,721
We bring it in, just like in space there wouldn't be a near and far and up and down and a right and left if it weren't for us here.

163
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,761
And we bring that with us.

164
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:07,481
That's how we make sense of space.

165
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:21,401
And I guess we used the founding talk: the lived space with a here and a now is basic and the only way of giving meaning to objective space.

166
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,840
By the way, to say this here-now, you have to listen, right?

167
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,360
I mean, remember, I said that C.I.

168
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,121
Lewis used to talk about the here-now predicament.

169
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,480
That's exactly the wrong way to think about here-now.

170
00:16:33,481 --> 00:16:45,320
That's to think that somehow I'm kind of imprisoned in my stream of consciousness, which is a series of nows located somehow right here.

171
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,400
That's the other wrong.

172
00:16:48,281 --> 00:16:58,521
Objective time doesn't make any sense without bringing us in, and inner time doesn't make any sense without bringing in some other notion of time.

173
00:16:58,521 --> 00:17:07,080
Because if there was a kind of just a here now, there wouldn't be any temporality, there wouldn't be any past and future.

174
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:29,360
You can't just be a stream of inner states if you were you wouldn't know it you'd be like an oyster or something a stream of inner states needs to somehow not just be a bunch of inner states some inner states have to be now and other ones past and future.

175
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,961
But you can't get that if all you've got is inner states that are now.

176
00:17:32,961 --> 00:17:36,480
Where will you get any experience of the past and the future?

177
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:49,360
That's his objection to what he called the psychological, trying to understand temporality, which has a past and a future in terms of a stream of inner nows.

178
00:17:49,360 --> 00:18:06,801
And it doesn't help to do it physiologically, he says, because then you'll have some end-grained engrams in the brain, which are supposedly recording the past, but they'll just be present engrams in the brain.

179
00:18:06,801 --> 00:18:09,521
And where does their pastness come from?

180
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:11,201
That's the puzzle.

181
00:18:11,201 --> 00:18:15,360
So that always happened puzzles, which I don't think we should spend too much time on.

182
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,801
In fact, Bernard.

183
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:21,041
Not that they're not good puzzles, but it's important to see what his view is.

184
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:30,240
So it turns out that somehow temporality has got to naturally be based on motor intentionality.

185
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:38,720
Our experience that there is a past, a present, and a future is tied up with our way of coping with the world.

186
00:18:38,721 --> 00:18:46,160
And it's wonderful and surprising, really, to find the house and the bath of the house coming back.

187
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:59,960
Finally, when we get to Merrill-Ponty's own view, which is after he's fat down all these other views of psychic traces and physiological traces in objective time, his view starts at the top of 483.

188
00:19:00,441 --> 00:19:13,801
The very first phrase I'm going to come back to, I think this is the phrase that causes all the mischief and makes no sense, but I don't want to start explaining it yet.

189
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:16,120
It is, but I'm going to raise the question.

190
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,360
It is my field of presence in the widest sense.

191
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,281
This moment that I spend working in so forth.

192
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,001
That's how I make contact.

193
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:33,801
Well, the question is, sort of, how wide is the sense of the present?

194
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:36,440
And in what sense is it?

195
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:41,160
I think that that's very hard to figure out.

196
00:19:41,801 --> 00:19:51,640
Here I am working at my table, as he says, and night is coming on, and I sense the time is passing.

197
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,200
What sort of experience is that?

198
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,240
Is it physique?

199
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,080
In what sense is it mine?

200
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,361
In what sense is it, and what is the widest kind of presence?

201
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,400
Well, now he starts to try to tell you things about that, which are very interesting.

202
00:20:07,721 --> 00:20:14,600
That there is this past, and there is this my presence and my life and so forth.

203
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:20,360
And finally, I think it gets really interesting about 12 lines down in that paragraph.

204
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,761
Everything therefore causes me to revert to the field of presence.

205
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,680
Already keep your eye open.

206
00:20:28,681 --> 00:20:32,120
Is it my field of presence or the field of presence?

207
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,200
What do you think about temporality?

208
00:20:34,201 --> 00:20:37,480
Is it your field of presence or is it our field of presence?

209
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,241
It's so confusing.

210
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:51,521
So everything causes me to revert to the field of presence, that's what I think say, as the primary experience in which time and its dimensions make their appearance analloy with no intervening distance.

211
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:53,120
That's very important.

212
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,521
That means that I am directly at the past and at the future.

213
00:20:57,521 --> 00:21:03,120
It's not something that I get at through something else.

214
00:21:03,441 --> 00:21:05,120
And this is Heidegger.

215
00:21:06,241 --> 00:21:08,240
When I think about the, not think about it.

216
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,041
If you remember the past, the dictionary past, you have to do it by representation.

217
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:20,640
But if you just turn your mind towards the Freiburg Bridge, as Heidegger says, you can be directly at the Freiburg Bridge now.

218
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,920
You could be directly at the Freiburg Bridge yesterday.

219
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,560
You have direct access to the past and the future.

220
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,720
That seems right, too, about the phenomenon.

221
00:21:30,721 --> 00:21:37,600
It seems to me I have a direct access to having been in my office before I ran over here.

222
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,440
I don't need to get it through anything else.

223
00:21:41,761 --> 00:21:45,521
But you can see how hard that is to believe that.

224
00:21:45,521 --> 00:22:02,320
But it's equally hard to believe that all I've got access to is something, some kind of present, what weird sort of present, I don't know, and something that's privately mine, out of which I somehow get the shared time and a past and future time.

225
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,240
One of the clearest ways, I'm just still thinking this out, so I have to keep saying it as I think about it.

226
00:22:08,241 --> 00:22:29,001
One of the clearest ways to see that something must be going wrong is if you realize that both Heidegger and Meryloponte, when he's getting it right, understand that there's no problem about how my world is related to the world.

227
00:22:29,001 --> 00:22:30,120
Remember that.

228
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,840
We open on a shared world from a perspective.

229
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,400
But it's a shared world.

230
00:22:37,721 --> 00:22:39,880
And it's a big mistake.

231
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:42,200
You can tell you're in reference.

232
00:22:42,201 --> 00:22:48,360
You know, you have lost it when you start worrying about how you get from my world to the world.

233
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:55,880
And yet, Merloponty constantly seems to sort of box himself into my time.

234
00:22:57,481 --> 00:23:02,041
And that's going to get him into serious trouble, I think.

235
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,401
It's just not the phenomenon.

236
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:07,320
I can't tell you something.

237
00:23:07,481 --> 00:23:11,640
Look around and think of the feel time passing.

238
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,680
It's not your time or my time that's passing.

239
00:23:14,681 --> 00:23:17,080
It's some kind of shared time that's passing.

240
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:23,960
And it's not passing an event that all we've got is the present, and the past and the future are gone.

241
00:23:23,961 --> 00:23:35,400
Then there's just a kind of transformation taking place where something, where the whole thing, if he says that he's getting it right, the whole thing as a whole budgets all the time.

242
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:51,001
There's the constant shifting around of what is the present, where the present is just the perspective on the past and the future.

243
00:23:51,001 --> 00:23:52,920
Or is it your perspective on it?

244
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,680
All it is so weird.

245
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:55,001
Yeah.

246
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,481
Yes.

247
00:23:59,481 --> 00:23:59,881
Okay.

248
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,560
We're going to jump all over the place.

249
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,200
I can see that, but I can't resist it because I'm s still sort of so much inside it.

250
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:09,160
That would already determine something crucial.

251
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:14,801
If you ask, what is the present, and you say it's the past.

252
00:24:14,801 --> 00:24:23,120
Now I'm giving a lecture, or now we're in the last week of the semester, or whatever, you're talking like Heidegger.

253
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,080
You're talking the way Merlot-Ponty sometimes talks.

254
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,441
And then the present turns out to be this expandable thing in the widest sense.

255
00:24:31,441 --> 00:24:36,480
The present might be now we're in the 21st century.

256
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:45,521
Once you start making it relative to what you're interested in and what you're doing, the present stretches into past and future.

257
00:24:45,521 --> 00:24:46,801
And it's also shared.

258
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:48,881
It's our task, it's shared.

259
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,440
So now we're having a lecture in the Heidegger course.

260
00:24:53,441 --> 00:24:55,600
That's the present, I think.

261
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:06,001
But you'll find Husserl and Merlot-Ponty getting into the idea that somehow the present is the task is irrelevant.

262
00:25:06,001 --> 00:25:28,240
Then what you've got, and he doesn't work it out very much because he shouldn't, but he buys it if he buys Husserl, that there is something like the specious present, some conscious, lived, more real moment in which things are passing out of into the past and other events are coming into out of the future.

263
00:25:28,241 --> 00:25:32,880
But this lived present isn't a knife-edge present.

264
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,080
It's a present.

265
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,560
I think it's an incoherent notion, but it's a present according to William James and Husserl.

266
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:45,521
It has a little bit of an echo of something in it and a little bit of a beginning of something in it, but it's not task relevant.

267
00:25:45,241 --> 00:26:06,281
Uh so you that's a tremendously important question, whether you're going to define the now and what's present in terms of your task, your engagement, your involvement, which you expect a a high degree of Merlot Ponty to do, or in terms of some kind of reflective inner, which is I think what Husserl does.

268
00:26:06,281 --> 00:26:11,400
And then you've got Marilla Ponty, who I think is cracking up over it.

269
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:11,960
Yeah.

270
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,560
I thought you had your hand up.

271
00:26:13,721 --> 00:26:15,400
Oh, Mitch had his hand up.

272
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:24,921
Well, I was wondering is if there's some sensible way of understanding my time in financial distributed space, where there's a similar problem of my space and the space.

273
00:26:25,241 --> 00:26:30,120
Well, basically I want to get away from the idea that it's completely incoherent, that there's my time.

274
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:43,240
I mean, there's a sense in which when I'm you know, when you do you talk about flow a lot, I guess it's related to this idea of kind of that when you're engaged in the flow of sport that time happens Well, I think you're right.

275
00:26:43,241 --> 00:26:50,041
See, remember I said too, I think there are really two different or something like just don't think I understand this.

276
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,560
This is just too complicated.

277
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:59,560
I hope somebody understands it better and writes a paper on it, but but I think there are two different aspects to temporarily or approaches to temporality.

278
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:06,200
If you try to describe what it's like to be fully engaged in a task, you'll get one description of temporality.

279
00:27:06,201 --> 00:27:23,240
But we also can sit back and reflect or listen to a a familiar melody and have a kind of inner temporal experience in which the something that's coming along comes along in its full presence and then goes out into the dim past.

280
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:24,281
And that's true too.

281
00:27:24,281 --> 00:27:25,560
That's what I'm trying to say to you.

282
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:32,680
There is a sense in which we do experience our own flow of time in our own inner sense.

283
00:27:32,681 --> 00:27:36,041
And now it it and how can they both be right?

284
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:38,840
Well, now we get really hard.

285
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,801
That's no that's why I think it's so confusing.

286
00:27:42,241 --> 00:28:00,560
I think they're both right if you realize that the engaged one is somehow again prior and founding, and that what you get when you reflect on the inner flow of time is a kind of oh what?

287
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,840
I don't know what it is.

288
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,481
It's uh let me see if I had a word for it though.

289
00:28:06,481 --> 00:28:08,801
Well, it's derivative.

290
00:28:08,801 --> 00:28:10,560
It's not a discovery.

291
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:31,120
When you find time in your inner experience and it's flow in a task-free way, what you it's something you can experience on reflection, but you couldn't think that that's the basic stuff out of which you have to constitute fair time, fair path, and so forth.

292
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:40,481
And the basic thing I want to say is you have to realize that when you reflect on time like that, which is I think how Isler did it, you distort it.

293
00:28:40,481 --> 00:28:42,001
You don't discover it.

294
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,320
That would be the Heidegger, I think, in our little Funcy intuition.

295
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,801
But again, and maybe the chapter says all this, but if it does, I couldn't find it.

296
00:28:50,801 --> 00:28:53,360
It seems to say, in fact, all sorts of other things.

297
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,920
I don't see that how you can do that.

298
00:28:58,481 --> 00:29:00,401
You see what it does for a time.

299
00:29:00,721 --> 00:29:11,681
When he says, when he says, when he describes Husserl's view, he doesn't explicitly by leaving it to the notion of past controls and engagement.

300
00:29:11,681 --> 00:29:12,161
He does.

301
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,481
Yeah, well, in my case, force explains.

302
00:29:14,481 --> 00:29:15,680
Because Husserl doesn't.

303
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:21,840
Well, if he does, I mean trying to best understand your 483.

304
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:27,480
He writes, um present it doesn't expel, this doesn't report his first vibe.

305
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,441
I see where you are.

306
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,041
Present itself in Nero Sands.

307
00:29:26,721 --> 00:29:33,161
I'll tell you, we've got six lines from the bottom of 483.

308
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,960
I don't understand how to get indeed there.

309
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,961
Yeah, that's Merylofonte talking in his own person.

310
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:43,560
I do not so much perceive objects as recognizable in the binary.

311
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,600
That's Merlot Fonte.

312
00:29:44,761 --> 00:29:50,281
I see tools, I think important tools in an admin past rather than confronted it.

313
00:29:50,281 --> 00:29:50,521
Right.

314
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:56,361
And then he explicates Christo's idea as an alternative pattern.

315
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,160
Yes, he does.

316
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,921
I think that's just wrong.

317
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,881
I mean, that's wrong.

318
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,640
Maybe it's a mistake in the representation of Christo, right?

319
00:30:03,721 --> 00:30:13,240
Yes, if that's the way he's interpreting this, then evidence that he's endorsing Christo is not evidence that very data passwords.

320
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:13,721
Okay.

321
00:30:13,721 --> 00:30:23,640
And moreover, let me just say that maybe there's a way of, like, when he contrasted the task or the conception of future and past involved.

322
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:25,320
Yeah, there's a name for it clear at the end.

323
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:25,560
Yes.

324
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:30,041
With the miscalculation, which is the conception of future present.

325
00:30:30,521 --> 00:30:35,721
I don't see is the evidence that Robinson was attracted to that miscalculated speech of present.

326
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,721
People say, again, I understand.

327
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:44,521
It's got to do with saying, every once in a while, frequently, he says, my present.

328
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:50,600
And then it, and it sounds sometimes like neurology can be expanded.

329
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:56,201
Maybe it always, okay, don't, I mean, the important thing is to keep your eye on the phenomenon.

330
00:30:56,201 --> 00:30:59,160
And it is true that what he does is mess.

331
00:30:59,481 --> 00:31:12,320
Not only is it complicated because I think there is a Husserl tendency in it, that he's reading Husserl in an entirely different way, I think, the lectures on inner time consciousness.

332
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,521
That's what they're called.

333
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:20,080
But he's doing it in a Heideggerian, he's reading Husserl in a Heideggerian way, and that's fine.

334
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:37,120
So now the question becomes much subtler, as Ali Reidman says: is he got it, has he making a coherent position, taking Husserl over and reading him in a Heideggerian way, or is he taking, swallowing something which will mix him up in the end?

335
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,080
I'm not sure.

336
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:51,360
But one thing is sure, he's trying to take Husserl into a task-oriented thing, and at the very end of the chapter, as if he suddenly remembered it, he tries to say that we live in shared time.

337
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,001
He only says it once, I think, in the whole chapter.

338
00:31:54,001 --> 00:32:02,080
You'd think it would be one of the most obvious phenomena you would have to deal with, that my time is your time and that there's only one time and you're all in it.

339
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,441
But he doesn't.

340
00:32:03,441 --> 00:32:12,001
And I think that's a sign that though he tried to take over Husserl into Heidegger, he didn't succeed.

341
00:32:12,001 --> 00:32:15,521
Because if he succeeded, then there would be just one time.

342
00:32:15,681 --> 00:32:20,641
Heidegger, it's clear that it's just one temporality we've all got.

343
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:27,121
It's called within kindness, where we all live together and have tasked together.

344
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:36,560
There is a place, just I might as well say it because of the thick and because of the shared, right at the end of the chapter, to my amazement, because I was thinking he's never going to get it.

345
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:48,400
At the very end of 503, that's about four eyes and the bottom that the root of all problems with transcendence is to be fought in the thickness of the pre-objective presence, which we can.

346
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,200
Is that what he's going to talk about when you're woven?

347
00:32:54,161 --> 00:32:54,560
No?

348
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,200
Wait, he must be here somewhere though.

349
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:01,161
I could have sworn there's a line very near here about the interweaving.

350
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:05,001
Oh, yeah, there it is, about 15 lines from the bottom.

351
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:06,921
Well, let's read this, where it ends up.

352
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,801
It'll help us know where we're going.

353
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:24,521
The two temporalities are not mutually closed of our two conscious consciousness because each one knows itself only by projecting itself into the present, where they can interweave.

354
00:33:24,521 --> 00:33:26,281
That's not my present there.

355
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,721
That's important.

356
00:33:27,721 --> 00:33:29,400
There is a the present.

357
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,401
How does that relate to the my present?

358
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,840
Well, I wish we knew.

359
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:43,641
As my living present opens upon a past which I nevertheless am no longer living through, and on a future which I do not yet live.

360
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:50,520
Now, that sounds sort of like a living streaming feature present to me.

361
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:56,681
Because if you could really open on a past the way Heidegger thinks you can, you're still living through it.

362
00:33:56,681 --> 00:33:59,641
Your past even goes ahead of you, Heidegger says.

363
00:33:59,641 --> 00:34:08,840
You can change your past according to Heidegger and according to Nero Ponte, because that's his retroactive reinterpretation when something goes wrong.

364
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,560
Yet he sees too much in his present there.

365
00:34:11,561 --> 00:34:12,520
But let's go on.

366
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:22,600
Perhaps never shall I be open, and on a future which I know not yet living, perhaps never shall, I can also open onto the temporality outside my living experience.

367
00:34:22,601 --> 00:34:23,401
See that?

368
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:50,801
That doesn't make it seem shared in past relative and quarrel horizon, with the result that my world is expanded into the, when you start with my world, my hair stands on it, but my world, there's no such phrase allowable, is expanded into the dimensions of that collective history which my private existence, private, takes up and carries forward.

369
00:34:50,801 --> 00:34:54,721
I swear he's been challenged inclusive and been possessed.

370
00:34:54,721 --> 00:35:00,640
The solution of all problems of transcendence is to be thought in the fitness of the pre-objective present, right?

371
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:12,801
And the fitness of the pre-objective present includes you guys, the task I'm involved in, the future that I am already directly confronting, the past which I'm also directly confronting.

372
00:35:12,801 --> 00:35:20,481
But he says the fitness of yah, in which we find our bodily being, our social being, and the pre-existence of the world.

373
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,201
Good.

374
00:35:21,201 --> 00:35:33,920
So if you can get all the thes and mys, the private and the public, together, as they are in that sentence, in a coherent way, you get an A plus, and I will take over your view.

375
00:35:34,081 --> 00:35:34,961
Okay, yeah.

376
00:35:40,161 --> 00:35:43,040
This totally could be so other souls.

377
00:35:44,721 --> 00:35:48,320
But it seems to be like a perfectly easy solution.

378
00:35:48,721 --> 00:35:54,080
It was the way I was going to a shared world.

379
00:35:54,081 --> 00:35:56,000
And Robert Honje didn't seem to take it.

380
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,400
He seems to have said very difficult words.

381
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,440
Do you think that's a solution?

382
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,120
I missed the beginning.

383
00:36:01,121 --> 00:36:03,440
Where was this other one in the central level?

384
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,560
Oh, the other cells chapter.

385
00:36:04,561 --> 00:36:05,761
Yes, they're not a physical Christian.

386
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,320
Okay, yes, you're right.

387
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,761
I mean, I don't get it.

388
00:36:09,761 --> 00:36:13,760
Whenever he does that, and then I don't want to assign a chapter, that's what happens.

389
00:36:13,761 --> 00:36:18,000
But then it always seems when he does that that he's come out.

390
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,761
I just want you to understand where I'm coming from, and then you come from wherever you want.

391
00:36:21,761 --> 00:36:23,360
You'll have something to disagree with.

392
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:59,961
Whenever he talks about, like, talks like that, as if there's a big problem of other minds or a problem of a shared world, it looks to me like he's come out of the sh normal experience of our shared culturing and a shared world as we're completely engaged, which ought to be the phenomenon he's describing, to some product of some kind of reflection in which he's now got a problem about how my world is related to the world, and then he has to solve it and no solves it somehow by waving his hands a lot and lots of metaphors until we're back in a shared world again.

393
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,400
That's the best I could do with it.

394
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:09,320
All of it is especially at Olivia Count, because I figure that if anybody can save this evening, go ahead.

395
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:18,600
What he tries to discuss is the access we have to the phenomenon.

396
00:37:20,121 --> 00:37:22,921
You don't have to consider it as obvious.

397
00:37:24,121 --> 00:37:31,480
You sort of have to have this naive look on what happens again, which doesn't mean that you have a good the reflective perspective of what happens first.

398
00:37:31,801 --> 00:37:52,681
Second, I think that in direct relation to this, for the truth, for the concern, there's no problem of how you can go from my time to the time, because of course my time, the the time is mine, but because what it takes from the sort is the fact that consciousness is itself the flow of time.

399
00:37:52,681 --> 00:38:01,801
So you're not sort of watching the time passing, you're living your own life is the time as it passes you.

400
00:38:01,801 --> 00:38:04,360
There's no possibility for you to reflect upon it.

401
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,641
It constitutes later on.

402
00:38:05,801 --> 00:38:06,600
That's true.

403
00:38:06,601 --> 00:38:08,921
Reflection is the wrong word.

404
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,921
But but I happen to have a new word, though.

405
00:38:11,561 --> 00:38:15,840
It's a kind, you could have a kind of disengaged time in which you are.

406
00:38:17,281 --> 00:38:20,000
It's what constitutes the subject.

407
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,000
I think you're right about that too.

408
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,280
Let me think about that.

409
00:38:25,601 --> 00:38:26,000
So.

410
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:30,640
Distinct Moyen talks about the time as transition synthesis.

411
00:38:32,161 --> 00:38:35,920
Yes, but this is these are the passage running on now.

412
00:38:36,161 --> 00:38:45,360
And the thing he's putting forward and the way he's interpreting User is that he relates the three horizons of time to the fact that we're embedded in the world.

413
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:50,721
Because there's Uso says that you have the present and the past and the future in the consciousness.

414
00:38:50,721 --> 00:38:57,041
And then you have perspective and perceptive or perceptual horizons in the world.

415
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,840
And so Belgon's is the same.

416
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:06,641
So the horizons of the world are the horizons of the actions that you might want to perform.

417
00:39:06,641 --> 00:39:08,880
Yeah, well, I totally agree with that.

418
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,801
So this is still always your world and your time because it's what you're doing.

419
00:39:14,801 --> 00:39:20,801
Even if it's at the same time as, say, you're listening to me this whole time, but I'm talking.

420
00:39:20,801 --> 00:39:22,081
So my time I'm talking...

421
00:39:22,241 --> 00:39:25,120
Suppose it's something we are doing, like having a conversation.

422
00:39:25,121 --> 00:39:26,480
Whose time is that?

423
00:39:27,121 --> 00:39:31,121
Well, the access I have to the conversation is from my time.

424
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:34,400
And yeah, as long as one doesn't sort of reify the time, it's like the house.

425
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:40,880
And the access they have to the house is not to something special called the front or the outshot to them.

426
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,920
You always have a perspective on it.

427
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:46,480
Otherwise, it wouldn't be tasked.

428
00:39:46,721 --> 00:39:51,120
But it's always a shared house, and it's all present at once.

429
00:39:51,121 --> 00:39:51,600
So true.

430
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:56,680
Okay, well, here, let me say more about this.

431
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,761
It's who the Husserl certainly wants.

432
00:39:59,081 --> 00:40:07,400
See, there are too many things happening at once, and we probably shouldn't be worrying about Husserl for a minute, because he really does Husserl.

433
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:15,721
Husserl doesn't bring in the pragmatic structure of shared time.

434
00:40:15,721 --> 00:40:23,001
And he gets out of it something like the living streaming present, which is the speech is present.

435
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,840
And Merrill-Ponty should have no faith for the speeches present.

436
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:50,681
And now the violin says about Husserl is he says he was pressing time from within it, but he's getting a description of time, which is the kind of description you would only get if you weren't fully engaged in it, because you feel that you experience, I don't know how long, a little speech is present that has in it all sorts of, let's look at the diagram.

437
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:57,400
The diagram, Merrill-Ponty turns the diagram into something that he wants to say.

438
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,880
That's fine, but do you understand the diagram?

439
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,481
Let's just go into it.

440
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:29,961
The diagram says that it's like boxes, it boxes in boxes, is the way I think about it, that your present experience is the experience of something that was just before that, a future experience, which contains in it already an experience before that, which is not yet come, which is the future of that future.

441
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:36,360
And of course, that contains within it an experience which hasn't come, which is the future of the future of that future, and so forth.

442
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:42,000
And then they unbox, that one of them becomes present, and then they start going into the past boxes.

443
00:41:42,161 --> 00:41:52,160
Then there is the just present but now past, and beyond that, the just present but now past, which is further past, and beyond that, the just present and now past with further past.

444
00:41:52,161 --> 00:41:54,961
Now, surely there's something right about that.

445
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:07,840
But it certainly doesn't seem to get the picture of what it is when you're involved in sort of in direct contact with the future and past in an engaged, shared, or even individual project.

446
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,600
Let me just read you.

447
00:42:09,601 --> 00:42:09,920
What?

448
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,080
Why doesn't it get that?

449
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:21,840
Oh, because it's assumed that what's real is a very small bit of time, namely.

450
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,880
Now, it's not here.

451
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,360
I know you said.

452
00:42:26,641 --> 00:42:28,880
He's got this living, screaming present, which is all.

453
00:42:34,081 --> 00:42:36,400
Yes, yes, well, I'm not disagreeing.

454
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,640
I don't know whether we want to talk about Husserl, which I just did.

455
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,880
And now you tell me what Merrill-Ponty is saying.

456
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:51,440
Merrill-Ponty has completely taken over the Husserl story and made it into what is almost right.

457
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,400
That's what Elva said.

458
00:42:52,721 --> 00:43:04,001
If you could picture the whole world as gradually things are getting clearer and more determinate, and then they're very determinate, and then they're getting more indeterminate.

459
00:43:05,281 --> 00:43:19,760
There's no slice in there called the specious present, in which for a moment the very determinate something is there, and everything else is there only by virtue of syntheses and so forth.

460
00:43:19,761 --> 00:43:23,761
It never in engaged experience is like that.

461
00:43:23,761 --> 00:43:26,320
I suspect you can get yourself into an experience like that.

462
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,801
I'm not even sure you ever can.

463
00:43:27,801 --> 00:43:28,360
I don't know.

464
00:43:26,721 --> 00:43:33,721
The nearest you can that I can think of would be listening to a melody that you already knew.

465
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:43,481
When you listen to a melody that you already know, you know that the future notes are already determinate and then sort of boxed there and they'll get unboxed till you hear that note.

466
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:48,041
And then that note will be a note that you already heard and moved more and more boxed into the past.

467
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:54,840
Well, I think it's no coincidence that Husserl writes the whole of internal time consciousness analyzing a melody.

468
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,281
Not a task, not something you're engaged with.

469
00:43:58,281 --> 00:44:01,160
And then you get this phenomenon, which Husserl describes.

470
00:44:01,161 --> 00:44:06,440
Now, it's complicated, and that's what Alvis says, but he never says anything here about speeches present.

471
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,080
He never says anything here about melody, you marvel on T.

472
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:19,081
That's right, because he's taking over the Husserl story into his own story, which could be right.

473
00:44:19,641 --> 00:44:28,761
If it was a story about how the whole world transformed itself, always in a kind of flow from past to present to future.

474
00:44:28,761 --> 00:44:37,640
Then you'd get the same kind of box, unboxed story, but it wouldn't be unboxed into a speech's present.

475
00:44:38,121 --> 00:44:39,561
That would be the difference.

476
00:44:39,561 --> 00:44:46,681
It would be unboxed as just the constantly changing perspective on everything.

477
00:44:46,681 --> 00:44:50,360
And Husserl could be turned into that.

478
00:44:50,360 --> 00:45:00,520
Let me just read you, by the way, where he goes through this diagram in a sentence or two, the way I just wish, so you can find it for your own self.

479
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,961
Well, I thought I might.

480
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,960
It actually tells the story 484, huh?

481
00:45:07,721 --> 00:45:08,281
Maybe.

482
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:10,760
When?

483
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,040
Well, 9484.

484
00:45:13,201 --> 00:45:14,000
484.

485
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,200
I thought it was much later.

486
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,641
And I miswrote down.

487
00:45:11,561 --> 00:45:18,080
Well, 484 is the diagram.

488
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,161
Much later, it does tell you the diagram in the way I just said.

489
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,440
Anybody know that?

490
00:45:24,561 --> 00:45:27,121
Yes, no, much later.

491
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,481
I think I remember next week.

492
00:45:33,121 --> 00:45:34,961
41870, maybe.

493
00:45:35,281 --> 00:45:36,960
487?

494
00:45:37,281 --> 00:45:38,401
Maybe.

495
00:45:38,721 --> 00:45:43,200
No, but it doesn't matter because it just does what I said.

496
00:45:43,201 --> 00:45:44,960
I mean, and that's what Husserl says.

497
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:52,241
And if you hear it a certain way, it's perfectly compatible with what Heidegger says and with phenomena and what Merrill-Ponty says.

498
00:45:52,241 --> 00:45:55,761
So let's try to hear it that way and see how far we can get.

499
00:45:56,641 --> 00:46:02,960
By the way, I have to stop and have a kind of moment of outrage about the translation.

500
00:46:03,281 --> 00:46:09,121
And that is, I meant to tell you last time, it's not only a question of outrage, but an apology.

501
00:46:09,121 --> 00:46:15,921
The translation is so totally wrong that it makes it sort of 20% harder to understand it.

502
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,400
And I intended to tell you, and then we got so involved in my diagram that I did.

503
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,081
The big mistake happens at the bottom of 483.

504
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,000
And it's hard to believe.

505
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I thought it was just dyslexia.

506
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,241
The Husserl terms are not protections and retention.

507
00:46:32,241 --> 00:46:33,761
Can you imagine?

508
00:46:33,761 --> 00:46:35,761
And you could hardly see it.

509
00:46:35,761 --> 00:46:36,801
It's so crazy.

510
00:46:36,801 --> 00:46:40,081
But it's potentially.

511
00:46:40,081 --> 00:46:42,880
That isn't in the original English translation.

512
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:48,081
It's a case of making it worse, but up to now they've just been little grammatical glitches making it worse.

513
00:46:48,081 --> 00:46:49,920
This is a disaster of making it worse.

514
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,680
We actually change the translation slightly well because we've probably worked with, but they read out of the world.

515
00:46:56,681 --> 00:47:05,400
The sentence you read on from the very, very end about the two is not quite rigid, but actually probably the older maybe.

516
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:09,320
Well, anyway, I'm going to, as soon as I get time, I've been too busy.

517
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:23,241
I'm going to call up the editor at Rutledge, and I'm going to tell him that they better fire this guy or woman, whoever this is, and they better not bring this out again until they get it fixed, or go back to the old one, which is generally that verbal.

518
00:47:23,241 --> 00:47:24,921
But this is incredible.

519
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:28,921
And of course, it's not just once, where we get it made a global change.

520
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,000
It's always a protection, three lines down on the topic, 484.

521
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:37,320
But what's even more amazing is it isn't always a global change.

522
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:41,001
Fifteen lines down in 487, you've got protections.

523
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,521
So how this was done is beyond me, but I intend to get to the bottom of it and give you a report.

524
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:51,960
But for the time being, didn't it confuse you immensely to have protections and retentions?

525
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,000
I mean, what?

526
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,240
You just don't see it.

527
00:47:55,241 --> 00:47:59,481
Well, if you read Ulsa, you don't see it, but they haven't, so they see it, I presume.

528
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,840
What did you think?

529
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,920
Anyway, I'm sorry.

530
00:48:03,641 --> 00:48:08,280
And it just has to, you have to remember, I don't think there is a word protensions.

531
00:48:08,281 --> 00:48:08,600
Is there?

532
00:48:08,601 --> 00:48:10,200
I think us will make it up.

533
00:48:10,201 --> 00:48:17,721
It's when we have a word retentions, and they come from what's already passed and what you're holding on to and retaining.

534
00:48:17,721 --> 00:48:24,041
So whatever you're projecting and hasn't happened yet, ought to be a protension.

535
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:26,281
So we invent the word.

536
00:48:26,281 --> 00:48:28,360
And then they undermine it.

537
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:37,721
Now, having said that, I was looking for the verbal version of the diagram, but I won't bother.

538
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:51,760
And certainly, it's important, as Olivia and Alva keep pointing out, that if you just don't know anything about Husserl and read this the way he wants to read it, you can fix it.

539
00:48:51,761 --> 00:48:56,001
Notice the middle of 484 is a fascinating way to fix it.

540
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:07,921
I want to say that, and this is an issue I'm going to get to in a second, that he says in order to write about the diagram, in order to make it complete, the symmetrical perspectives of protections would have to be added.

541
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,440
Time is not aligned right now.

542
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,481
That's right.

543
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,401
And Husserl doesn't have them.

544
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,641
And he knows Husserl doesn't have them.

545
00:49:14,641 --> 00:49:18,400
And the question is, why doesn't Husserl have the protensions?

546
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,801
And what would it do if you added them?

547
00:49:20,801 --> 00:49:23,200
Well, I think that's really interesting.

548
00:49:23,201 --> 00:49:25,440
And that's tied up with the house.

549
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:29,760
It's just as Husserl doesn't understand the backs of houses, he doesn't understand the future.

550
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:36,481
I think if I put it in upper colour republic, just use the transitional synthesis.

551
00:49:36,721 --> 00:49:44,400
That's exactly the term citing Husserl that Mother Hans uses in the article, the privacy perception, when discussing the house example.

552
00:49:44,400 --> 00:50:05,201
So he really wants us, whether or not, you know, the reading of this reading of Husserl, he really wants communications of, as it are, the analogous transitional sense that what's required to experience, I think this is related to my time, the buttons.

553
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:16,001
But what I would have said when you first started the challenge trying to reconcile that, he said part of it has to do with the dialectic of puzzlement.

554
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:24,761
So there is a a puzzle that needs to be s explained about the way in which the unseen part of the house is present half the room.

555
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:32,040
And so somehow, in order to indicate it is absent, you need to say something about the limitations of the perspective after room.

556
00:50:32,201 --> 00:50:45,080
And I think that um in in the pharmacy of perception, what he what he initially says, he talks about a transitional synthesis, whereby the house of the whole is made available to one.

557
00:50:45,241 --> 00:50:47,241
And that seems to be exactly here.

558
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,721
Well, I never see that pharmacy of perception.

559
00:50:49,721 --> 00:51:00,360
I think it's a mistake on his part, if he does, to talk about, and he does make mistakes in that paper, the pharmacy of perception, because it's a kind of popular talk he's given.

560
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:08,281
The important thing, whatever words we use, the important thing is he wants to say that the back is present now.

561
00:51:08,281 --> 00:51:11,160
Or I don't know that now is the right way to dial and complicate me.

562
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:16,921
When you're looking at the house from the front, the back is present.

563
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,840
The back is present now.

564
00:51:19,161 --> 00:51:20,280
Now I want to say that.

565
00:51:20,281 --> 00:51:22,360
When you're looking at the house from the front.

566
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:27,561
That's what you've got to have if you're going to do a Merlot-Ponty story about the house.

567
00:51:27,561 --> 00:51:42,120
That means that you've got to be very careful and not think of time or objects as series of, say, reified perspectives, which somehow have to be together.

568
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,880
There's no spitting them together.

569
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:47,401
The house is given all at once from the front.

570
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:52,121
And time is given all at once from the present.

571
00:51:52,121 --> 00:52:03,481
But the present isn't something you can sort of mark off and delineate because there is no sort of pure present.

572
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:09,881
There's just, there's the house from the perspective that you get when you see it from the front.

573
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:18,320
If you think the front is like a facade that you can sort of stitch the back onto, you're in the trouble of the girl on Telegraph Avenue again.

574
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:33,200
So now he rightly thinks that it's, you've got to understand the present, the way you understand the way that even the back of the house is present when you're seeing it from the front.

575
00:52:33,201 --> 00:52:35,761
So let's read that, because I think that's very important.

576
00:52:35,761 --> 00:52:38,000
That gives you the top of 483.

577
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:44,240
Remember, I said the crucial thing is that it's my field of presence in the widest end.

578
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:50,241
Now, I don't know about the mind, but the widest sense is what this is going to be about.

579
00:52:50,241 --> 00:53:02,320
The widest sense is the way and the future are present to me right now in a way the back of the house is present to me right now.

580
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:14,640
So everything therefore causes me to revert to the field of presence as the primary experience, I like to observe there, in which time and its dimensions make their appearance unalloyed with no intervening distance.

581
00:53:14,641 --> 00:53:16,241
That's important.

582
00:53:16,241 --> 00:53:19,201
And with absolute self-evidence.

583
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,400
Even the back of the house is absolutely self-evident.

584
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,601
Now you might want to say, yeah, but you could turn out to be wrong about it.

585
00:53:25,601 --> 00:53:27,761
Yeah, that's the way it goes with self-evidence.

586
00:53:27,761 --> 00:53:30,881
And you can turn out to be wrong about the front of the house when you're in front of it.

587
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,160
Maybe it's going to turn out to be all a clever laser construction or a facade.

588
00:53:36,161 --> 00:53:42,241
But whatever it is, the back of the house is as present as the front because the whole object is clever.

589
00:53:42,241 --> 00:53:43,521
That's what he thinks.

590
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:51,120
So the benefit of the familiarity distance with absolute self-evidence, it is here that we see a future sliding into the present and on into the past.

591
00:53:51,121 --> 00:53:58,521
I want to say, yes, the whole future of the world slides constantly into the present and on into the past.

592
00:53:56,561 --> 00:54:02,040
Nor are there these three dimensions given to us through discrete moment.

593
00:54:02,601 --> 00:54:07,080
That that really what we want to avoid, because it's a kind of quote.

594
00:54:07,081 --> 00:54:10,761
I do not draw a mental picture of my day at Laysa Point with all its weight.

595
00:54:10,761 --> 00:54:12,121
It was still there.

596
00:54:12,121 --> 00:54:16,041
That's the the way the past is still there.

597
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:23,080
And and he would say you could go back and open it up by thinking of by, you know, not remembering it.

598
00:54:23,081 --> 00:54:25,881
That would be, see, I better say this right now.

599
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:43,721
There's a way of relating to the past and the future that both Husserl and Merleoponte understand and is something we do, but you've got to distinguish it from whatever it is that Husserl and Merleoponte and Heideber think has to do with the way temporality is, basically.

600
00:54:43,721 --> 00:54:52,360
That is, they're not talking about how you can remember the past and expect the future.

601
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,521
That's representational.

602
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:58,121
I can expect there'll be another election in four years.

603
00:54:58,121 --> 00:55:03,561
That's perfectly fine, but I'm not at that election right now openly.

604
00:55:03,561 --> 00:55:08,600
I have to get there only by symbolically representing it and so forth.

605
00:55:08,601 --> 00:55:17,881
I can remember that we had a lecture on this last Tuesday in which this stuff was a big problem, and that's representational.

606
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:26,601
And I can I it has conditions of satisfaction and whether it really happened or not and if it didn't happen then then it does its conditions of satisfaction aren't satisfied.

607
00:55:26,601 --> 00:55:32,121
That's different than the way and it happened and we can do that.

608
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:37,560
But neither, nobody in this story is trying to discuss expecting and remembering.

609
00:55:37,561 --> 00:55:45,681
They're discussing anticipating, which is a the engaged way of getting related to the future.

610
00:55:45,681 --> 00:55:52,640
And they're discussing, I don't know what the word is for instead of remembering, it is like a non-representational word.

611
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:53,520
Does anybody know?

612
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:54,881
Something like recollection.

613
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,121
No, that's even worse, I think.

614
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,560
Recalling, that's not so good either.

615
00:56:00,561 --> 00:56:01,360
That's a little better.

616
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,600
You could sort of call it as if it's still there.

617
00:56:05,681 --> 00:56:06,801
Reliving.

618
00:56:06,801 --> 00:56:08,160
I think that's another thing.

619
00:56:08,161 --> 00:56:14,001
That's what happens in cruise when you take meet for Madeline and you're actually there again.

620
00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:15,920
I'll go for recalling.

621
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,201
Reckoning?

622
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,801
Reckoning is about the past.

623
00:56:21,681 --> 00:56:24,481
Let's do recalling as opposed to remembering.

624
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,401
I mean, there's no real distinction in English, I think, but we need a distinction.

625
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,801
And this is what Husserl was trying to get at.

626
00:56:32,161 --> 00:56:33,761
They all agree about this.

627
00:56:33,761 --> 00:56:36,400
Protensions are anticipations.

628
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,561
They're not expectations.

629
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:48,320
They're not, it's a, remember, it's a, what is it, a, operative intentionality.

630
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:55,121
That is, it's an intentionality that doesn't have a mental representation related to something outside it.

631
00:56:55,360 --> 00:57:00,320
So that's pro-tensions is supposed to be getting at anticipations.

632
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:10,000
And retensions is supposed to be getting at this something or other, which is still there in a way that you can have a direct access to it.

633
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,161
It can be present to you, even though it's past.

634
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,281
Now I can go back.

635
00:57:15,281 --> 00:57:16,320
Let's read this again.

636
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:19,761
You can see no other dimensions given to discrete acts.

637
00:57:19,761 --> 00:57:22,241
I did not form a mental picture of my day.

638
00:57:22,241 --> 00:57:28,120
That would be remembering and expecting kind of thing.

639
00:57:26,721 --> 00:57:32,920
It lays the claim that all its mind is still there, though I did not recall any detail of it.

640
00:57:33,561 --> 00:57:34,761
Recall, I know.

641
00:57:35,081 --> 00:57:40,521
I have the, that's probably chosen, at least this translator thinks that's the right word.

642
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,680
I have the intending power to do so.

643
00:57:42,681 --> 00:57:45,161
I still have it in my hand.

644
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:51,320
That is what it says, that if you want to feel the unity of the book, say I still have it in my grip.

645
00:57:52,121 --> 00:57:53,480
That doesn't change anything.

646
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,201
Have it in hand is an idiom.

647
00:57:56,201 --> 00:58:01,001
And have it in grip is just a metaphor that Merrill-Ponty is going to use for that.

648
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:10,360
So that my grip, which is, you know, as usual, the crucial issue, is I've got the past in my grip and I've got the future in my grip.

649
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:19,320
In the same way, I do not think of the evening to come and its consequences, and yet it is there like the back of the house.

650
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:26,281
This is everything hinges on that house, of which I can only see the facade or like the background beneath the figure.

651
00:58:26,281 --> 00:58:30,280
Our future is not made up exclusively of guesswork and daydreams.

652
00:58:30,281 --> 00:58:35,561
Ahead of what I see and perceive, there is, it is true, nothing more actually visible.

653
00:58:35,561 --> 00:58:48,840
That my world is carried forward by lines of intentionality which trace out in advance, at least the style of what is to come, although we are always on the watch, perhaps to the day of our death, for the appearance of something else.

654
00:58:48,840 --> 00:59:02,520
That would be, you know, an explosion of the Norima, an explosion of your expectations like the stone on the path, in which it turns out you have to retroactively relate to a different task.

655
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:11,840
But wait, what's important here, and I don't know how important, but to me it's very important, Husserl hasn't got potentials.

656
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:15,520
Why he knows there are potentials, he just doesn't put them on his diagram.

657
00:59:15,681 --> 00:59:20,561
He doesn't talk much about them, as I recall, in the internal time consciousness.

658
00:59:20,561 --> 00:59:31,441
That's because his view of the back of the house is that it has certain features that you know for sure because every house has to have them, like a wall.

659
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:35,521
And it has other default features, like it has some number of windows.

660
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,840
It's indeterminate, we indeterminate the wrong thing.

661
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,961
We don't know which number of windows.

662
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:46,880
But it's a different kind of back for him than it is for Merrill-upon-T.

663
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,520
Because for Merrill-upon T, you notice it's the style.

664
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,801
He said that before.

665
00:59:50,801 --> 01:00:05,521
It's something about houses in general or Georgian houses in particular, which give you an already present, indeterminate back of the house that you're coping with now already.

666
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:17,121
And the sense in which it's present is that you already have an indeterminate sense of what it'll be like, and you have a sense of how you could go around and get a better look at it, and you're being called to get a better look at it.

667
01:00:17,121 --> 01:00:23,281
And the call is coming from the present, indeterminate, yet, back.

668
01:00:23,281 --> 01:00:26,560
That's the, we've seen that picture before.

669
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,200
And the present, it's now it's gone.

670
01:00:29,201 --> 01:00:31,920
The present itself, in the narrow sense, is not positive.

671
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,920
The paper, my pen, and so forth are there for me.

672
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,360
I did not explicitly perceive them.

673
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:38,320
I did not so much perceive objects as regular the environment.

674
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,080
I see support in my tool.

675
01:00:40,081 --> 01:00:43,360
And now he goes on and he gives you the biography.

676
01:00:45,121 --> 01:00:50,961
And I have a feeling, this is now again a paper topic, more for me than for you, I think.

677
01:00:50,960 --> 01:01:04,680
But I have a feeling that Husserl has a problem with potentials that Merrill-upon T doesn't have because he doesn't have a notion of the style of the future or temporality of the style.

678
01:01:04,681 --> 01:01:09,320
And therefore, I don't know how he thinks about the future.

679
01:01:10,281 --> 01:01:25,721
Well, I don't know too much about what Husserl says, but it seems that one of the striking differences for Merlobon T that Husserl probably doesn't have is more intentionality, and so it's this kind of a bodily synthesis, and there is a sense of transition sympathy, but it seems like nuance.

680
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:26,920
Yes, good, good, good.

681
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:29,080
And the way to see where the anticipation is.

682
01:01:29,081 --> 01:01:38,681
The way to see that is, and that's just, I wrote down here somewhere about the doorknob, of course, which is the thing that's our favorite example of that.

683
01:01:38,681 --> 01:01:51,320
That is, the way I am already, right now, coping with the doorknob as I start to leave the room, even though the doorknob is over there, it's part of my present.

684
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:54,041
I'm already dealing with it now.

685
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:58,681
And in this big now, the doorknob is included.

686
01:01:58,681 --> 01:02:01,721
And the same thing is how the past of the house is.

687
01:02:01,721 --> 01:02:04,120
I'm already dealing with it now.

688
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:10,840
And Merrill-Ponty is saying, and he's attributing to Husserl with you, which is fine.

689
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:11,641
We don't care.

690
01:02:11,641 --> 01:02:14,120
I mean, and if he Husserl helped so much the better.

691
01:02:14,121 --> 01:02:23,081
And he's attributing the view that for Husserl, you're dealing with the past now, and you will be dealing with it for a long time.

692
01:02:23,081 --> 01:02:31,561
And you're dealing with the future now, and you will be dealing with it until it becomes past, and then you'll be dealing with whatever that future is.

693
01:02:31,561 --> 01:02:34,281
All this has got to be in there.

694
01:02:34,281 --> 01:02:36,120
Now, I've seen, where am I?

695
01:02:36,601 --> 01:02:43,201
Basic idea is a variation of Husserl 483, contrast memories and retentions.

696
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:50,801
Oh, yeah, this just to tell you, remember, I just made that sort of riff on the difference between a memory and a retention.

697
01:02:52,000 --> 01:03:05,601
In the middle of 485, he says, there are certainly identifying syntheses, but only in the expressed memory and voluntary recollection of the past, that is, in the modes derived from consciousness of the past.

698
01:03:05,601 --> 01:03:09,440
That is to say, there's a derivative representational kind.

699
01:03:09,761 --> 01:03:28,561
Just to give you the place where he says it, so it's not representational, but like on page 486, well, here's the operative intentionality, which he attributes to Husserl and Heidegger.

700
01:03:28,561 --> 01:03:41,040
And what the important thing is, it is a kind of motor intentionality that opens up a field, you know, is a kind of openness to everything as present.

701
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:44,000
That's the rich sense of presence, the wide sense of presence.

702
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:54,880
Remember, the way that the back of the house is present is the widest sense of present, the thought that in temporality, we want that wide sense of presence.

703
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:59,760
We don't want any kind of species present.

704
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:16,801
So in Husserl language, beneath the intentionality of the act, that's remembering, which is the fetic consciousness of an object in which an intellectual memory, for example, converts us into an idea, we must recognize an operative intentionality.

705
01:04:16,801 --> 01:04:18,801
So he likes that.

706
01:04:18,801 --> 01:04:23,520
When he says operative intentionality, I take it, he's equating it with motor intentionality, isn't he?

707
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,440
That's what he thinks with.

708
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,241
Or isn't he?

709
01:04:26,601 --> 01:04:32,600
He does every once in a while, I think, try to do that, which makes the former possible.

710
01:04:32,601 --> 01:04:39,561
That is, there's a kind of intentionality that makes remembering and expecting possible.

711
01:04:39,561 --> 01:04:43,000
It's the kind of intentionality that's already at the doorknob.

712
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:51,081
It's the kind of intentionality that's got anticipation and recall built into it.

713
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:55,000
And which is the Heidi transcendence.

714
01:04:55,081 --> 01:05:06,441
My present outlets itself in the direction of the immediate future and the immediate past and impinges upon them where they actually are, namely in the past and in the future themselves.

715
01:05:06,761 --> 01:05:08,281
Boy, that's a funny thing.

716
01:05:08,281 --> 01:05:15,400
To me, that's like a sentence that says, in the middle of one second, a host of string, you know, and a high-doe thing.

717
01:05:15,561 --> 01:05:18,200
Why wouldn't he say the immediate future?

718
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:24,041
As if there was something, as if somehow talk about the house.

719
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:37,401
That would be like sort of emphasizing the side of the house, the front of the house, whereas what he wants to say is that the whole future is already wrapped up in this.

720
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,320
I don't know what immediate future means.

721
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,960
An immediate home is the user.

722
01:05:44,121 --> 01:05:44,760
Yeah.

723
01:05:44,761 --> 01:05:52,281
But I mean, if I look at it so immediate sounds so much like the future present.

724
01:05:52,281 --> 01:06:00,360
It sounds like there's a special kind of future which will stop being immediate, whereas we all agree, and maybe he does too, that it shades off.

725
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:03,801
That there's no clear thing called immediate future.

726
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:06,600
I think it's kind of like a joke, like if there is an immediate.

727
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:18,801
So there is an immediate future and an immediate present, since I've got to see that as part, or there is an immediate past and immediate future, but we have to see that as part of the immediate present, in which case it just kind of employs this whole yeah, that's what you think he's doing.

728
01:06:19,121 --> 01:06:20,241
This is the thickness of time.

729
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,080
It gives you the fitness, okay.

730
01:06:22,801 --> 01:06:23,601
And it does.

731
01:06:24,161 --> 01:06:28,881
Mainly and and it opens us to the past and the future themselves.

732
01:06:29,201 --> 01:06:41,761
Well, that's true in Husserl and that's true in Heidegger because you could think that there was a species present which has just enough of an echo in the f of the past that it opens you to the immediate past.

733
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,681
I'm thinking of a melody now.

734
01:06:43,681 --> 01:06:52,081
And just enough of a sense of the if you can have this potential in Husserl, of what's coming next, that it opens you to the immediate future.

735
01:06:52,081 --> 01:06:54,960
And that's but he's taking it over.

736
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,161
I'll go along with Will.

737
01:06:56,161 --> 01:07:01,041
He's taking it over so that you have to read the immediate future as the whole future.

738
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,960
And the immediate past is the whole past.

739
01:07:03,281 --> 01:07:04,880
My present outruns itself.

740
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:10,560
And so it's just it's not an immediate and an immediate present wouldn't outrun itself, one way of putting it.

741
01:07:10,721 --> 01:07:11,201
I guess.

742
01:07:11,601 --> 01:07:12,641
That's the wrong way of thinking.

743
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:18,241
Yeah, it's a funny sentence, because if the present outruns itself, then there isn't an immediate future.

744
01:07:18,241 --> 01:07:18,880
You're agreeing.

745
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,081
It's a kind of joke.

746
01:07:20,081 --> 01:07:23,280
Well, I don't know if it's a joke or what, but it's it's a funny sentence.

747
01:07:23,281 --> 01:07:29,520
I don't start me as a joke, it's starting as a as a bit of undigested go through, but I hope it's a joke.

748
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,681
Uh you got your hand out?

749
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:37,281
Um see, if it were a melody, you could see how that would make sense, you said that.

750
01:07:37,601 --> 01:07:39,441
Okay, I'm gonna go on.

751
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,801
Struggle on.

752
01:07:40,801 --> 01:07:49,681
Uh but okay if you're unshorty oh great, I just want to see where I am.

753
01:07:49,681 --> 01:07:51,040
Okay, yeah.

754
01:07:52,160 --> 01:09:29,601
Maybe I don't stay there as a very flat way to read that sense um okay just just just in the sense that um the immediate future is the part of the future which is the fire happen and the immediate path would then let this happen just as you might say in hand yeah it's just you still have it in hand it's just near um direction so that okay so the president runs itself in that direction in that direction and uh and that's all he's saying you know it's a little exciting okay i i will i look why not just say that lends itself in the direction of the whole future i mean it did that's i mean i tell what makes me nervous is it seems to suggest that there's something special called the immediate future now if as you say if the immediate future just means it's like the house right if the house is mighty deposited right then there's a sense in which uh the rear that has a person yeah but now supposing not about the white house and watching the that's also there to have and if you think about it then but it's you have to you have to travel to go to something and that's and that's uh an expected not an anticipating you're not involved with the white house unless maybe you're the president i mean i paid for an open meeting well let's say well let's say you're president let's say you're sitting in copper texas and you're thinking about the paper you best on your office um it's it's present to you in some sense but it's not immediately present.

755
01:09:29,761 --> 01:09:31,360
You can't just look.

756
01:09:31,361 --> 01:09:33,280
You can't just reach out and grab it.

757
01:09:33,441 --> 01:09:35,200
Reach out and transitionally dream.

758
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:39,601
You have to get in your desktop and go there and che those are so it's still a little bit less immedium.

759
01:09:39,601 --> 01:09:40,721
It's a little bit better.

760
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:41,520
Yeah, okay.

761
01:09:41,521 --> 01:09:42,641
Well, that's fine.

762
01:09:41,641 --> 01:09:50,160
And it's still in your grasp, sort of, if you know it's on your desk and you know how to get it if you send an aide to get it and so forth.

763
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:51,681
And you can do that.

764
01:09:51,681 --> 01:09:55,040
But it's not in your grasp as much as the paper on your desk in front of you.

765
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:58,641
You have such a strong viscerality that is doing compared to it.

766
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:05,361
I think that's clear that we see him using motor intentionality and citing visceral as his as analysis.

767
01:10:05,521 --> 01:10:06,960
Yes, that's what makes me so annoyed.

768
01:10:07,441 --> 01:10:09,521
Christer has no melody of motor intentionality.

769
01:10:09,681 --> 01:10:11,200
That's the way he does it.

770
01:10:11,361 --> 01:10:13,360
Yes, but he's taking over visceral.

771
01:10:13,361 --> 01:10:15,360
I don't mind him taking over visceral.

772
01:10:15,361 --> 01:10:28,721
It's just that it makes me just worried because I think it probably makes it impossible to understand what operative intentionality really is if you think that it's the same as motor intentionality.

773
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:40,880
I think motor intentionality requires a bodily engaged set and listen to that melody where if that's where we have this operative intentionality doesn't.

774
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,840
So I would just like let's keep chiseral clear.

775
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:53,280
I think lister is right about the way time is manifest as a phenomenon, if not on reflection, at least somehow when you're not engaged in a shared task.

776
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,600
And I think we should have that.

777
01:10:55,601 --> 01:10:58,080
I just think we shouldn't learn something together.

778
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:58,320
Yeah.

779
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,080
Outrunning itself.

780
01:11:00,401 --> 01:11:02,721
You can think of the present as outrunning itself.

781
01:11:02,721 --> 01:11:09,840
And in this moment, I have an anticipation of a certain feature and ready at hand of a certain path.

782
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:15,920
And in the next moment, it's always outrunning that feature and outrun this path to be a different feature in a different path.

783
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:21,761
But at the same time, um, there can be something in my face that outruns my anticipation of it.

784
01:11:21,761 --> 01:11:30,280
Like I'm going to reach out and test the doorknob and notes to me it could be made of jelly or or something that I don't anticipate.

785
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:32,280
So enough trends are also outlined.

786
01:11:32,441 --> 01:11:35,000
So I'm just wondering that's okay.

787
01:11:35,321 --> 01:11:38,200
Yeah, I is there I mean, I'll go along with that.

788
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,721
I mean, is there a question in there?

789
01:11:39,721 --> 01:11:41,561
If there is, I don't I I'll try to answer it.

790
01:11:41,641 --> 01:11:43,400
I don't understand yet what the question is.

791
01:11:43,801 --> 01:11:56,840
Ah well, it's already I'm already dealing with I'm agreeing with you, I think, in Melpon T anyway, I'm already dealing with the doorknob as something solid that can be turned and will get me out of the room.

792
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:11,480
In that sense, I'm already that the I've already outrun the any notion of something special about the the the present that I haven't that I have to wait to get to the doorknob before I could cope with it or something like that.

793
01:12:11,481 --> 01:12:24,040
That I'm always when I'm engaged in a task in a non-reflective way, I'm always already engaged with a lot of stuff that that's not in some narrow sense present to me.

794
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:28,840
And it seems and that's this wide sense, and the doorknob is an example of it.

795
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:46,280
And that's then I think we should if if if talking about immediate past and future is talking about the way the doorknob is still present to me, is present to me before I ever turn it, and will be present to me after I've left the room, then fine.

796
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,200
That's all right.

797
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,880
I'm not sure we understand each other, though.

798
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:51,240
You're looking very worried.

799
01:12:51,561 --> 01:12:55,320
Oh, there ought to be, I see, yes, there ought to be room for surprises.

800
01:12:55,321 --> 01:12:56,840
Remember what I just read.

801
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:04,280
He thinks there is when he says, where did he say this, that I'm always waiting that maybe something will go completely wrong?

802
01:13:04,361 --> 01:13:05,960
Where did I just read that?

803
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:07,480
You know what I mean?

804
01:13:07,761 --> 01:13:18,320
And he said, there's always getting a grip on things, but as we get a grip on things, you also 483.

805
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,840
So I want to keep that built in for sure.

806
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,320
Whereas, oh, that something else could happen.

807
01:13:24,321 --> 01:13:25,920
Yeah, that's for something else.

808
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,200
That's also in there.

809
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:33,360
Not only am I set to deal with the doorknob, I'm set to be surprised when the doorknob doesn't do what it's supposed to do.

810
01:13:33,361 --> 01:13:37,761
That's built into the way I cope with things when I'm involved.

811
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,520
Always have to be ready for a breakdown, I think.

812
01:13:41,521 --> 01:13:43,521
And I think that's okay.

813
01:13:43,521 --> 01:13:44,561
Well, I have three minutes.

814
01:13:44,561 --> 01:13:47,280
Let me see if I can make sure that we've got what everybody.

815
01:13:47,361 --> 01:13:51,360
Oh, here's the doorknob on 489.

816
01:13:51,361 --> 01:13:53,920
Let me see if I need to talk about that.

817
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:55,521
Maybe it isn't the doorknob.

818
01:13:55,521 --> 01:13:57,681
Maybe I'm just reading the doorknob into it.

819
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:02,801
Well, but it's, I'm trying to interpret.

820
01:14:02,801 --> 01:14:11,120
So this statement, the passage, middle of the page, the passage of one present to the next is not a thing which I can conceive nor I see as an onlooker.

821
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,320
I affect it.

822
01:14:12,321 --> 01:14:18,080
I am already at the ending present as my gesture is already at its goal.

823
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:23,040
I am myself time at time which abides and doesn't flow.

824
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,200
And so never mind that we're getting off the cunt.

825
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:35,040
But that's the idea again, that I'm always, already at the door, even though I have, even though it could surprise me.

826
01:14:36,481 --> 01:14:40,160
Pretty strange thing that that seems to be the phenomenon.

827
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:42,000
Okay, let's see.

828
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:47,040
So it looks like there could be just one big present.

829
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,600
And I think that's how you'd come out with this.

830
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:53,440
Yeah, that's the field of presence in the wide sense again.

831
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,801
Halfway down on 492.

832
01:14:57,721 --> 01:15:03,801
Of that nature then, of what nature then is that waking time in which eternity takes root?

833
01:15:03,801 --> 01:15:10,840
It is the field of presence in the wide sense with a double arising of primary past and future.

834
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:15,880
Interestingly enough, Albert, instead of immediate past and future there, he's got his primary past and future.

835
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:16,761
What's the difference?

836
01:15:16,761 --> 01:15:17,400
I don't know.

837
01:15:17,401 --> 01:15:19,400
Why doesn't he stick to one or the other?

838
01:15:19,401 --> 01:15:24,440
And the infinite openness of those fields of presence that is ruled by.

839
01:15:24,441 --> 01:15:25,960
Why the world?

840
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:31,160
I mean, it seems to me the whole point is that there's one constantly shifting field of presence.

841
01:15:31,801 --> 01:15:39,320
And this is what he's attributing to Hutzworld too, in which there are these dimensions of future and past, and they're constantly shifting.

842
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:42,761
Why do there be that plurality of fields of presence?

843
01:15:42,761 --> 01:15:43,960
I don't know.

844
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,360
I'm not even sure Hutzworld would have done.

845
01:15:47,321 --> 01:15:52,360
And then we are present to the world, the middle of 492.

846
01:15:52,361 --> 01:15:54,840
That's what you hope he would say.

847
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:58,521
Now, who's he talking about here at the bottom of 492?

848
01:15:58,521 --> 01:16:01,240
I'm just telling you the things that puzzle me.

849
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:19,801
So a former experience, a far line in the bottom of 492, a coming experience, in order that they may appear to me, need to be born into being by a primary consciousness, which in this case is my inner perception or recollection or imagination.

850
01:16:19,801 --> 01:16:27,000
I don't really even know what that wide term meant, but it sounds awfully inner.

851
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:33,080
It sounds very different than this widest field of presence in which everything is present.

852
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:39,240
Uh I'm okay, I'm going to quickly try to, because they're going to throw me out of here, but I don't wanna go back to it.

853
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:45,521
Uh so we've got 492, I don't quite know what to make of that, but we will leave it.

854
01:16:45,681 --> 01:16:53,920
On 494, there is at the bottom of 494 an unfolded series of presence.

855
01:16:54,240 --> 01:17:00,400
How can there be a theory of presence if the presence is just this transitional row?

856
01:17:00,401 --> 01:17:04,960
Again, I don't even think Husserl thinks that there's a series of presence.

857
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:07,040
So I don't get that either.

858
01:17:09,601 --> 01:17:12,641
And then at the middle of 495, very different.

859
01:17:12,641 --> 01:17:22,400
We consider everything that bears a significant relationship to our concerns at the moment as part of our present, thus recognizing implicitly the time and significance of a one thing.

860
01:17:22,401 --> 01:17:26,561
So that anything that concerns me right now is part of the present.

861
01:17:26,561 --> 01:17:30,240
That's like Bush worrying about having left a speech on the desk.

862
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:31,840
That sounds right.

863
01:17:33,441 --> 01:17:37,360
And now I think I've got to the end about shared time.

864
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:41,521
So we've got this funny thing at the end, which I read that time has to interweave.

865
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:55,920
It turns out that time does interweave, and that the thickness of time gets us in a shared social being and so forth, but it certainly seems to have come out of a hat as far as I can see with no preparation.

866
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,440
And that's it.

867
01:17:57,441 --> 01:18:00,641
I I just tried to tell you why I worried about it.

868
01:18:00,641 --> 01:18:04,561
If you could keep your eye, always keep your eye on the phenomena as LeMoral.

869
01:18:04,561 --> 01:18:09,600
And if there are several different phenomena, keep your eye on the difference between the different phenomena.

870
01:18:09,601 --> 01:18:12,441
And if you don't, it doesn's a mess.

871
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:13,440
I don't know.

872
01:18:13,481 --> 01:18:15,441
But you know, I don't I don't know.

873
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:43,801
That's the way I was doing my message or they are not going to improve the part of the website.

874
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:01,880
Well, that means the 20th of June, is that right?

875
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:05,000
That's the last year.

876
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:10,360
Okay, because you don't gotta ask these people for money still because, oh, guess what?

877
01:22:10,361 --> 01:22:13,160
I fly to Paris on the 14th after tomorrow.

878
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:18,280
Yeah, I'll get in a month now.

879
01:22:26,681 --> 01:22:28,360
I think it's just that we can do it faster.

880
01:22:28,761 --> 01:22:32,360
You sit in the typewriter because I or the computer's not dislikes.

881
01:22:34,681 --> 01:22:35,801
I think we can do it in an hour.

882
01:22:36,441 --> 01:22:44,840
We've already written the most elaborate cover letter from me saying how important it is and how reliable and intelligent you are.

883
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:48,120
But I expect you've come in for an hour or something.

884
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:51,641
Yeah, I'm probably going to tomorrow's Friday.

885
01:22:51,801 --> 01:22:53,400
Actually, after Wednesday.

886
01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:55,080
Sure, after next Wednesday.

887
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:55,880
That's what you want.

888
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:56,441
Okay.

889
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:57,320
Yes.

890
01:22:57,641 --> 01:22:58,681
Then it would have to be.

891
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,920
I leave Notre Dame early on that Friday.

892
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:08,920
So it it could be, but I because I won't it could be Monday the ninth because I come back to Notre Dame on Sunday.

893
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:10,040
Monday the ninth.

894
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:11,801
That could be good from France.

895
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:12,681
Oh, whatever.

896
01:23:12,681 --> 01:23:13,240
I'll be fine.

897
01:23:13,561 --> 01:23:16,360
And I mean I could and we could do it at from three to four.

898
01:23:16,361 --> 01:23:17,000
Is that a good time?

899
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:18,360
Okay, at three to four.

900
01:23:19,561 --> 01:23:20,920
I have no idea that I want to tell you.

901
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:21,400
Okay.

902
01:23:21,401 --> 01:23:29,320
Um in case this family doesn't want to hop out um I thought maybe the French consular would be interesting.

903
01:23:29,321 --> 01:23:33,561
I I'm afraid I don't have a new one.

904
01:23:58,321 --> 01:24:00,960
Okay, maybe that's a more dangerous thing.

905
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,521
It doesn't pose a problem.

906
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:10,240
Okay.

907
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:16,240
I think the problem is everybody thinks that.

908
01:25:20,481 --> 01:27:07,880
I think the fountain in secret, how to keep it now, hey, I don't know about I mean, not the same both wall and actually I'm doing yeah.

909
01:27:07,441 --> 01:27:17,280
And didn't we ever talked about the people crazy, but we don't do any direct mode that's a only only the motion that we always hope for motion by slow.

910
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:30,801
I was gonna maybe I'll get wrong like you all go to a hooker which comes in and swallows something else like that and probably swallow a lot of stuff that we don't want.

911
01:27:48,641 --> 01:28:16,880
Well, you say regularly compute my time in the design while other people might need to I mean because we're trying to put in computer design in general to be doing the time that without being learning but you don't control the new time slow and if you have important your unique ideas and maybe my time if you don't use your own thing.

912
01:28:36,321 --> 01:28:41,920
It's the same process and the one you can't create all the time from those sets when you go see the house.

913
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:48,400
The house is a nice function on the device, but it's one definition for these two things.

914
01:28:48,401 --> 01:28:53,681
The big device on the extreme list you can do is different things when you record.

915
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:56,801
You have an expensive.

916
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:23,960
I started off this um Thursday uh twelve dollars.

917
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:33,160
Um and we are back uh inner country from Scotland and uh let's go forward checking up on my telephone.

918
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:38,120
Um uh power code reactor and probably for the rest of the day.

919
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:40,761
I'll be able to say it open or park the end of the day.

920
01:30:41,481 --> 01:30:44,880
Yeah, scored and students down.

921
01:30:45,441 --> 01:30:46,481
Yeah, it's possible to find
