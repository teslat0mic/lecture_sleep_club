1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,800
Now, there's plenty to talk about today to finish the Ponky Toe chapter, but I also said that if anybody now reads this thing on indeterminacy that I handed out and doesn't think it's right or doesn't understand it or doesn't get the great ha-ha you're supposed to get when you read it, that now all your confusions about indeterminacy have been cleared up.

2
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,200
If you could say so now, just you know, this is all times and visibility.

3
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,159
Okay.

4
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,119
Anybody, does anybody have a problem with it?

5
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,359
I don't particularly want to discuss it.

6
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,159
I want to, because I think, I think it's clear.

7
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,040
I'm certainly ready to discuss it, but if it isn't clear, then it needs to be clarified.

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,600
Yeah.

9
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,199
You're still not clear about something.

10
00:00:45,519 --> 00:00:45,919
Okay.

11
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,639
With the last sentence that I took.

12
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,240
Well, that's the hardest one.

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,880
Well, that's a, yeah, you're right.

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,680
We should discuss that.

15
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,479
I mean, that's just to say I would have to give Sean's lectures again.

16
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:00,639
That's the deepest and hardest thing.

17
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:02,639
I barely understand it myself.

18
00:01:02,639 --> 00:01:09,999
You heard me make the mistake of this very handout at the very end when I said to Sean, but what you're saying is on page so-and-so.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,680
And he said, no, that's not the kind of indeterminacy I'm talking about.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,919
That's the kind of indeterminacy you're talking about, in effect.

21
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:21,679
And if there's time, I'll go back over it.

22
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:26,159
But I guess I'll say it, but it's just so strange.

23
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:39,799
It's that you never experience that, quote, true color, which is always in the background and accounts for the normativity.

24
00:01:40,040 --> 00:02:06,359
Namely, that you're always experiencing whatever color you're, whatever, the true red, whatever red you're experiencing, you're always experiencing it as, I'm getting it better, I'm getting it worse, it would be better over there, I couldn't get it better than this, this is terrific, or boy, I need to do a lot to be able to see that color, change the light in the room to brighter, or take it outdoors.

25
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:21,640
And what you don't ever see is that normative something or other, which is always in the background, directing you to get better or worse sights.

26
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:29,959
Now, what is weird is there could be a situation in which you get the best view possible of the color.

27
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,799
The lighting is right, your position is right, the surrounding is right.

28
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:37,559
That's when it gets confusing between Sean and me.

29
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,519
Because then I want to say, but then you see the red as well as you're ever going to see it.

30
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,720
That's right.

31
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:53,479
It's just that Nero Bunch doesn't want to call that the true color because he's the name the true color is this norm in the background that you never see.

32
00:02:53,479 --> 00:03:04,919
What you want to say about it is there can be a situation in which you sense that you cannot get a more optimal grip than you have now.

33
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:12,359
And the way that color looks then is you could just call it the true color, but he's going to call it something else.

34
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,239
That's just the best look on the color.

35
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:20,440
And that's equally the zero point of your normativity tension.

36
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:32,320
That is, you're not feeling any tension, you're not feeling that there's anything you can do to make it better, when you're not feeling anything, and the color's looking just fine, that's the optimal grip.

37
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:55,759
And you can get an optimal grip on the color because in the background, there is this sense always there of how far you are deviating from this other sort of true color, which may be the best way to put it in person is you may never have an experience of this other color of the sort that now you really see it.

38
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,799
Because it's not the sort of thing you could ever really see.

39
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:08,960
It's directing you, and it's even going to direct you, if you're possibly, to the place where you think now I really see it as best you could ever see it.

40
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:21,679
But even if you never got that, the true color would still be there, so to speak, in the background, directing you and giving you the sense that you haven't ever got the true color.

41
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,679
That's not the true mark.

42
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,359
You haven't ever got the best view of the color you could get.

43
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:38,239
The kind of optimal I'm talking about under number one, which I've always thought was the, is a kind of optimal you might never experience.

44
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,479
But you could if you got the best light and everything.

45
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:53,119
The other kind of true color, the one that Sean is talking about, which is, I think, certainly deeper and something that Merlot Planty has a weak grasp on.

46
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,319
It's so original that it comes and goes in what he writes.

47
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:06,799
But that other color, or that normative color, is something you could never have an optimal grip on.

48
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:08,759
That's a different issue.

49
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,200
Now, go ahead.

50
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,800
Did I make it any clearer?

51
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:12,999
Oh, I'm still.

52
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:14,519
Okay, I just think.

53
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,479
Would it also say that reload points you would have influenced?

54
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:25,239
No, so in the info, or if it's not, so I mean, there are points of differences between color and shape.

55
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:29,239
And that, you know, with color, it seems like you can just get and call it once and for all.

56
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:30,520
But with the shape, it was a little bit more.

57
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:31,639
You're right, you're right.

58
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:37,479
You could still have the optimal view of the shape, where you had as clear a picture of the shape as you could get.

59
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:39,479
Getting any closer, you would lose stuff.

60
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:41,479
Getting any farther away, you would lose stuff.

61
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:43,960
Taking another perspective, more would be hidden.

62
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,080
There is an optimal.

63
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,720
Yeah, for shape and the size.

64
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,479
Well, I don't know about size.

65
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:57,320
Yes, I suppose you guess if you sense that you're not in a good position to see the size, if you were closer or further, you would see the size.

66
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:57,799
Yes.

67
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:12,439
All of the basic characteristics of the object have a true X in the background, which is always directing your sense that you could either get it better than you got it or telling you, look at that, no tension, you've got it.

68
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:14,679
And I can say one more thing.

69
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:15,799
Wait, but let me first.

70
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:16,199
Then you.

71
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,080
Well, no, because my thing is going to take us slightly astray.

72
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:19,560
Go ahead.

73
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,080
Where do you come from?

74
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:26,759
Because I can't think of it.

75
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:34,600
What I have in my background is always experience of degradation, which caused me to do more and more and more.

76
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:40,600
I don't need an original prime motivation and perfect color or shape.

77
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,999
I just know that my basics of the experiences that I need.

78
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,919
But that's that's interesting.

79
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,960
But it's not a sort of thing.

80
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:59,040
It is just that, which you name, that whenever whatever I'm perceiving, I'm always having a sense, too, of whether this is the best or whether it could be better.

81
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:02,479
And I have a sense of the direction that would make it better.

82
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,919
That's that is all there is to say about this, I believe.

83
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,320
Let me say let me think so.

84
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:26,400
I mean, if it it might help to say to some people that it's the you've got an attractor for red, and if they talk like Walter Freeman, and it's in that attractor landscape, when you're in that attractor, it's always experienced as, have you got to the least energy yet?

85
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,080
There is a least energy.

86
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:40,319
If you've got a category in your brain for red, or the rabbit has a category for a carrot, that in the brain, of course, isn't anything you experience directly phenomenologically.

87
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:55,439
But the phenomenological sort of effect of that way the brain is that you're always sensing that you are at the bottom of the attractor or you're not, which I now am going to tweet out the attractor.

88
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:57,759
You're always sensing you get it better or not.

89
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,559
And so you can say this much little bit more to you.

90
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:11,040
Well, experience with red or the smell of carrot sets up your brain in such a way that you've got this kind of normativity in your experience.

91
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:27,120
And the Merrow Ponchine's name for the the phenomenal the phenomena of this attractor, since he can't call it the brain attractor, that's the wrong level, is to say that it's the true color in the background that you never experience.

92
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,640
Is that a problem?

93
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,040
Go ahead.

94
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:43,879
If I were saying that the moon is an only fine one, but there's probably right.

95
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,199
I'm not sure, though, Basa.

96
00:08:47,400 --> 00:09:08,679
No, and maybe he should say what you're saying, but he does think that you're experiencing, and this is what Rick was saying, there is a perspective in which the most, you could almost say information, though that's a dangerous word, I mean, a perspective on the shape of the object in which you learn the most about the shape from that perspective.

97
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:11,000
It's better to see that there are perspectives in which you don't.

98
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,320
If you're right up against the back of a house, that's not a good perspective.

99
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:21,880
If you're sort of a house, you can't ever get a very good perspective because it's a three-dimensional object.

100
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,319
But take the red again.

101
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:36,600
It's not arbitrary that in a certain lighting, there you have an experience that if you change the lighting any other way, you're losing something.

102
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:42,519
And it's phenomenologically arbitrary, I think, but I don't think it's neuro-arbitrary.

103
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:48,760
Underlying that is the whole way the eye works and takes in the light and so forth.

104
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,799
But it's a good question.

105
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,999
You see your question?

106
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:01,640
I mean, I'm going to say, I mean, it's harder to see with color than with shape, or because it's hard to see that there are, but you can see it.

107
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:08,520
Look, it can't be right that in a dim light, you can best see the color of the tie or the book.

108
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:14,760
And it also can't be the case that they're not blindingly bright light, you can't see the color right.

109
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:21,800
So why should it be arbitrary that somewhere between, there's the point in which you see the color at its best?

110
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,919
I think it's not supposed to be arbitrary.

111
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:29,040
It has probably some Gibsonian information pickup story to be told about it.

112
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't think, I mean, it must be an optimal of invariant pickup, no?

113
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:38,400
I think it's kind of just moving.

114
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:48,799
I mean, with Gibson, you don't really have an indeterminateness or indeterminacy story in the way in which you do from low-pine feet, because it seems like tension and indeterminacy go hand in hand with reliance.

115
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:51,840
That is, a indeterminacy, which kind of creates a tension.

116
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,679
We have ID before is less tension.

117
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,120
The guy is more determinate.

118
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:55,919
Right, right, right.

119
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,200
That's true, all that.

120
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:02,560
I was just thinking that there has to be a physical story to be told about it.

121
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:10,000
And it would be something about which someplace there's the maximum pickup of the relevant information out of the stimulus array.

122
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,680
I don't know if Gibson would say it, but I don't see why he shouldn't say it.

123
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,600
But let's talk about it later.

124
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:16,400
Okay, Alva.

125
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:27,280
Just I'll make a very brief comment because I think I think all you need to say is that the true colour is like the back of the heart.

126
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,199
That is, there's absolutely no difference.

127
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:39,919
There's a sense in which the true colour is measured, because if there's a sense in which you see a house with a zeal or a house that's fully with back, that there's a sense in which the idea is very from you.

128
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,840
So there isn't something that needs to be explained.

129
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,640
There's a gap that defies the kind of information.

130
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,280
And more often, it's great.

131
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,240
It's very unclear.

132
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,120
Let me see one.

133
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:52,480
I've got to say one thing about that first.

134
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,439
Yeah, but you can go around and see the back.

135
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,560
And that sounds more like my kind of true color.

136
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:03,760
Under the best lighting conditions, there it is in your face, the red button, which would have happened before.

137
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:14,360
When you're looking around at you at the whole city, as it were, from every point of view available at once.

138
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:17,880
And that's all it means to say that you can't see the red all at once.

139
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:23,000
For me, anyway, that's exactly the difference between indeterminacy one and indeterminacy two.

140
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:31,640
You just told a story about the optimal and how there's whenever you try to get the optimal with houses, you lose something.

141
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:37,800
But you but this kind of true color story is supposed to be that you never get it.

142
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,800
Not that you when you get one of p one of it, you get you lose some other of it.

143
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,440
Where's the true color?

144
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,360
Never get it simply because you can't see an object of all sides at once.

145
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,280
And likewise, you can't see a surface in all colors.

146
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:52,280
No, that's my story.

147
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,040
No wonder everybody's confused, though.

148
00:12:54,040 --> 00:13:02,120
I mean, that's all correct, except it isn't as if you can't see the true red that Meryl Ponty and Sean are talking.

149
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:07,960
When Meryl Ponte is talking about what Sean is talking about anymore, you never see the true red.

150
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:10,839
And it's not like you never see the other side of the object.

151
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:12,760
The true red isn't even red.

152
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:24,200
The true red isn't any more red than the stimulus array or the attractor or something that is causing you to have the normative experience of being nearer or farther from it.

153
00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:25,880
Where's the true red quote?

154
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:31,160
We can't go on and on like this talking about a fan if we haven't got in front of it.

155
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,679
I have no idea where it is.

156
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,960
There's only one place I think, really.

157
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,160
Okay.

158
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:40,760
Now this is no, this is my optimal.

159
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,439
That's very interesting that you should find it.

160
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:46,120
That one is the, you reach the red color.

161
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,799
It's wonderful in founders.

162
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:57,839
You you should write it on your handout because the opt of the best statement of of my position on determines and true color, I want a pen.

163
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:58,720
Anybody got a pen?

164
00:13:53,720 --> 00:14:00,000
I seem to have run off without one.

165
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:07,119
Anyway, you got another one?

166
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,680
Yeah.

167
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:20,480
Okay, so 371 is exactly what I talk about, and Alva talks about too, and Merlot Conte certainly talked about a lot more than he talks about.

168
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,680
Now, look, I reached the real color.

169
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:26,560
The real color is not the same as the true color.

170
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,239
No wonder you're all confused.

171
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:36,560
When my experience is at maximal clarity, now we've got to find a tactic which in effect says we never reach the true colour.

172
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,640
Can you find that?

173
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,080
What?

174
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:42,480
356.

175
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,360
I hope.

176
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:45,439
Let's see.

177
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:46,880
The real color, but yes?

178
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,640
Yes, that's it.

179
00:14:48,640 --> 00:15:00,960
The real color posits beneath appearances, about five lines down, as the background beneath the figure that is not a scene or thought, not as a scene or thought quality, but through a non-sensory presence.

180
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,680
Now, the back also has a non-sensory presence.

181
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,079
No, I think the back has a sensory here.

182
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:12,959
That I am actually sensing the presence of the back the way I'm sensing the room behind my back, I think, for Merlot.

183
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,520
At least, but that doesn't matter.

184
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:20,880
The real color, notice he's using the same word, real color.

185
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,200
No wonder everybody's confused.

186
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,679
But John always said he was confused.

187
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,919
That is Merlot Conte.

188
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:42,440
And I've always said, well, I know what I'm talking about, because you know what you're talking about, but I never realized that he uses the name for some non-sensory presence, which is in the background.

189
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:53,800
And he uses the real color for something else, which could be in the foreground, namely, when I see the color with maximum richness and optimize everything, so forth.

190
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,240
So I'm very puzzled.

191
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,760
Oh, wait, but you can go ahead.

192
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,799
There's somebody I thought had.

193
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,679
No, go ahead.

194
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:10,840
Okay, I don't know what this thing was what Ala was saying, but it seems to me like one way you could think of true color or true shape would be the property as it would be seen if it were possible from all perspectives.

195
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:16,919
So for the house, that would be being able to see the front and back all sides at once, which of course we can't do.

196
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:23,160
And for the color, it would be, I think what Alva was saying, was being able to see the color in all lighting conditions or something like that.

197
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,919
And so those would be the true shape and the true color, and that's different than optimal grip.

198
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,679
No, that's not that different.

199
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,319
That just, well, that's the optimal.

200
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:33,959
The optimal for houses isn't very optimal.

201
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,640
You lose a lot when you get it as you go around it.

202
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:45,479
The optimal for color is very optimal when you get the light right and everything right and you see the color as the best we're ever going to see it.

203
00:16:45,480 --> 00:17:01,720
And the idea that you could describe that color that you see under the best conditions when you're in good shape and wide awake and so forth and so forth as something not seen or thought but a non-sensory presence, that can't be right.

204
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,760
I mean, I can't be right about the optimal experience.

205
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,959
I was trying to describe the other one.

206
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,920
I was trying to describe the one that was a non-sensory presence.

207
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,479
Well, how was that?

208
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,040
Tell me again.

209
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:18,599
If the idea was: what's non-sensory, what you could never sense would be the color under any lighting conditions, or the house viewed from all perspectives at once.

210
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,879
But that's what's in the background that we can never get a grip on, and that is.

211
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,520
Well, why would it be the color?

212
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,040
But the color under, oh, I see.

213
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:27,040
No, that would be the imperative version.

214
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:35,040
The color would then be sort of the sum total of color patches that this color looks like in all lights, in all shadows, and so forth.

215
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:42,079
That's not the non-sensory presence for him, because that wouldn't have the normative.

216
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,040
It wouldn't be drawing you toward one of them.

217
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,440
And that's an absolute feature of the real color on 356.

218
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:51,680
Whoa!

219
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,679
Where, where, where?

220
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,919
Okay, let's see.

221
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,319
Let's read.

222
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:00,160
Okay, wonderful.

223
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:01,520
Where's the somber power?

224
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,319
392.

225
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:03,280
Oh, yeah, okay.

226
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:03,760
Yes.

227
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,280
Well, that's another, that just says it again, but it's important.

228
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,399
There is a sensible one, and that's number one.

229
00:18:10,399 --> 00:18:13,760
And that's 371, and lots and lots of places.

230
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,319
And there is the non-sensible somber power, that's normativity.

231
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:20,319
And that's from 356.

232
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:26,799
And probably somewhere else in the whole of Meryloponty, I can't believe that Sean made all this up from one sentence.

233
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,799
But if he did, it's still something that Meryl-Ponty's got a hold.

234
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:42,399
It's just a name for the normativity aspect, that there has to be something that is giving you the sense of now it's going well, now I could get it better.

235
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:48,479
And the name of it is, I think confusingly, very confusingly, the real color.

236
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,959
That would great help if you called it something like the normative color.

237
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,000
Yeah.

238
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:03,280
I don't know what this has to do with somber blackness, but I don't see why the color under all lighting conditions, that which underlies the way the color looks in every condition, can't be.

239
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,640
How does it underlie it?

240
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,639
As a norm that draws you toward the best of them?

241
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,760
Well, it's going to be the best of them relative to your sensory system or something like that.

242
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:13,799
Well, you've got everyone.

243
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:19,399
One of those factors is the best of them, you've got laid out in your sort of empiricist picture.

244
00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:28,760
But we need a story about how the best of them actually dictates your behavior and everything else being equal draws you toward it.

245
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,559
That's what the empiricist can't understand.

246
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,639
Okay, you don't that's all right.

247
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,319
We can discuss it more, yeah.

248
00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:54,599
Well, under type one indeterminacy, you say in the last sentence that objects are infinitely rich, and I'm wondering, is there a sense in which colors are objects and in the same way infinitely rich like objects are infinitely rich because there's a sense of a true color or a real color or either?

249
00:19:54,839 --> 00:20:12,119
Objects, colors are infinitely rich in the sense that, and this is related to what James would think, there is an indefinitely large number of ways that that color could look in different lighting, surrounded by other colors, where you had a drug, and all that.

250
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,440
Those are all the ways that color can look.

251
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,200
And it's an infinite number of them.

252
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,879
And you could never see them all at once.

253
00:20:17,879 --> 00:20:19,559
You could only see them one at a time.

254
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,559
In fact, my story, not John's book.

255
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,760
Well, is that color the true color or the real color of that plant?

256
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:28,920
Unfortunately, Zara Pontius is real color for both of them.

257
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,240
But in fact, so we need, I don't know what to say.

258
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:38,599
I'm going to just, let's, for our conversation, we're going to call my story the real color story, which is the one we're having now.

259
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:47,479
That there is a red that is the best red, and there's an infinite number of other ways that red can appear.

260
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,559
And maybe that best red never appears.

261
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:51,720
Maybe you could just never get the best lighting on it.

262
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,199
That would be all right, too.

263
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:56,559
That's the, let's call that the real color.

264
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,719
Let's call Sean's, because he calls it that, the true color, which I'm going to call a normative color.

265
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,760
That's different.

266
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,839
That's just altogether different.

267
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,520
Let me, this might help.

268
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,359
Suppose I tell you the story, maybe you're going to get a kind of aha, and maybe it's going to just complicate things.

269
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:17,359
But there were experiments done.

270
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,760
I wish we had Eric here who knows more about these psychological things.

271
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,520
But they were done a while back when I, how was I doing?

272
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,119
I was writing my computer book, so it must have been about in the 70s.

273
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:36,480
And maybe they've been done since too, by the psychologist who was, I think, at the University of Oregon named Posner.

274
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,319
If I say all this, some of you may recognize it and tell me more.

275
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:48,479
He produced, using a computer, all sorts of distortions of an optimal figure.

276
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,040
Optimal, a particular figure.

277
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,799
Optimal doesn't mean anything yet.

278
00:21:52,799 --> 00:22:01,599
It was the figure of which the computer program had generated all these various distortions.

279
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:15,439
And in that sense, it was the paradigm of this abstract sort of figure, because every one of the distortions could be experienced as more or less far from it, if you thought it.

280
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:23,520
But he then showed people pictures or whatever of all these figures which were distortions of the paradigm figure.

281
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,960
And they could judge them as better or worse, even though they'd never seen the paradigm figure.

282
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,639
Isn't that nice?

283
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,839
There's got to be formed in a tractor or something.

284
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:36,240
Anyway, that's the somber power.

285
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:45,000
That there was a paradigm there that was directing them to be able to see every other example as better or worse, even though they'd never seen it.

286
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:50,439
In this case, they could have seen it, which makes a little difference from the story.

287
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,520
And that's why I was almost afraid to tell it.

288
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:57,799
But the idea is: don't bring that in if you can help it.

289
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:09,719
The way he set it up, it didn't ever have to be seen to do the job of making all the other figures look like good or bad examples of that kind of figure.

290
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,760
Does that help, or does that just blur the two?

291
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,720
I don't know.

292
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:15,319
I think I should go on.

293
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:19,319
This is absolutely amazing, but I think it's not at all a waste of time.

294
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:21,719
But it's not what I want to talk about today.

295
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:28,280
But I did say if you had questions we could ask, and you did, then I did my best.

296
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:28,919
Okay.

297
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:34,839
Now, before we discover that we had gotten nowhere, I still have to go back one more time.

298
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:50,520
Because that whole discussion of transcendence last time was sort of circling around a very, very deep, important idea, which I didn't quite have until I went home and thought and worried about it more.

299
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:55,240
I think that there were two views of transcendence running around.

300
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:00,440
But I think one of them was, well, let me say something first.

301
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,000
Okay.

302
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:07,239
He said after class, this is separate.

303
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,839
I want to get this off the table.

304
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:22,359
He said after class that transcendence is a very bad word for this whole discussion because it's built into the notion of transcendence, that something inner transcends to the outer.

305
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:29,760
So that transcendence would be the mind transcends, gets outside itself to the transcendent object.

306
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:38,799
So built into the very word transcendence in the philosophical use of it is exactly the view you don't want.

307
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,280
So no wonder if lots of people were confused, they were confused.

308
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:48,079
Now this is no accident that the very worst words of expression.

309
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:54,079
Remember, keep in mind that what we're really trying to talk about is the empty openness, that we are a field and all that.

310
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:55,280
I'll come back to that.

311
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:03,199
But talking about some transcending from, you know, in Husserl, you transcend from the inner to the outer.

312
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,119
And that makes sense of the word transcendence.

313
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:11,359
Well, Heidegger had a perverse, it's all Heidegger's fault.

314
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:24,399
He has an amazing desire to take other people's terminology and turn it on its head and make it mean exactly the opposite of what they meant it to mean and sort of take it away from them.

315
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:25,680
It's a great game.

316
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:41,040
He took Husserl's word transcendence and made it mean exactly the opposite of what it meant for Husserl, where there's no longer a coming out from the inner to the outer, from the inside to the outside, from the mind to the world.

317
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:48,240
That's exactly what Heidegger wants to deny, and who denies it by saying Dasein is transcendence.

318
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,359
And that means, to talk Tony Heideggerian, Dasein is the world existing.

319
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:55,839
And that's a very narrow contouche-like phrase.

320
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:57,520
That's been being in time.

321
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,680
So to begin with, you've got to not let the word transcendent fool you.

322
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:09,879
And just ask yourself, what else could it mean besides coming from the inner to the outer.

323
00:26:09,879 --> 00:26:20,119
Well, I think that it means something different than Husserl even, than this old sort of Cartesian kind of transcendence.

324
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:28,199
Husserl's very strong in another kind of, I think, not that Husserl would perhaps deny that transcendence, I don't know.

325
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:36,760
But he has his own interesting view of what transcendence is, namely, that there's always more to the perceptual object than I can ever experience.

326
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:44,599
That it belongs to the objects of experience, that they've got more aspects, you could be them under more conditions, and so forth.

327
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:45,879
That's what it is to be.

328
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,680
And Husserl's got that.

329
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:51,000
I don't know if he discovered it exactly.

330
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:51,480
C.I.

331
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:55,079
Lewis had it too, but they were about contemporaries.

332
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:57,960
And it's right phenomenology.

333
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,799
So now we've got Husserl transcendence.

334
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:02,359
It isn't the mind going out toward the world.

335
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:07,559
It's that the object always has more to it than we can ever experience.

336
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:13,240
Again, a weird transformation of what you would think the word could normally mean.

337
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:19,319
But Husserl transcendence then is totally different from Heidegger's Nero-Pontique transcendence.

338
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:22,520
Not that Heidegger and Nero-Ponti want to deny.

339
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,319
Far from it.

340
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:24,359
They both agree.

341
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:27,879
There's more to the object of experience than I can ever experience.

342
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:35,879
But they want to co-opt the word transcendence for the business of being an empty head turned towards the world, for the extas.

343
00:27:35,879 --> 00:27:43,719
This extas business is how I am always already outside of myself, where there isn't even any myself.

344
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,999
I'm just always already outside, period.

345
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,680
So that one is on 429, just to occasionally touch up with the text.

346
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:59,280
This is the one that Heidegger and Merlot-Ponty, just in the beginning of the Kokito chapter, the third sentence.

347
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,479
I probably have already read it.

348
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,439
I don't remember.

349
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:08,559
My life is constantly thrown headlong into transcendent things and passes wholly outside me.

350
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,799
Now transcendent things are the normal use of transcendent.

351
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,040
That means things in the world.

352
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:26,639
Calling them transcendent things is a very misleading thing to do because that already suggests the whole inner-outer story that you just think of them as things out in the world.

353
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:32,799
And it has a wholly, so my life passes wholly outside me.

354
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,559
And of course he says it amazingly many different ways.

355
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:46,159
Well, but now that's, now what I realized yesterday is that these two are very interestingly related.

356
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:51,760
There's the Heidegger, just call them the Husserl idea and the Heidegger idea.

357
00:28:51,760 --> 00:29:02,639
And now the Merlot-Ponty idea is the brilliant move of putting them two together and having both meanings of transcendence going all the time.

358
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:22,639
And that is that what Merlot-Ponty wants to say is because I'm absorbed in the object when I'm coping, the fact that the object has more aspects than I can ever cope with is essentially correlated with the way that I am always outside myself.

359
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:30,000
I'm always outside myself at the ground floor level as a transparent coping being.

360
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,040
And that has the two sides of it, of the two sides of the coin.

361
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:47,959
The object has always got more to it than I'll ever experience, and I'm always outside myself trying constantly to get a better and better and better grip and a better and better sense of that object.

362
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,119
I think that's the interesting thing.

363
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:57,799
They come, to sum it up, the two senses of transcendence in Husserl and Heidegger come together in motor intentionality.

364
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:14,440
Motor intentionality just is this combination of a totally always more object and a being that is always totally committed to constantly revealing more about the object.

365
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,079
Now, of course, there's lots more about us than that.

366
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:45,399
But remember, when Meryl-Ponty says that we are empty heads turned toward the world, or all our experience, how was I just read, is out there in the world, he's talking not about how we appear to ourselves on reflection, I'll come back to that, but how we experience ourselves, if you even do experience yourself, how we are when we are completely committed and involved in coping.

367
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,160
That's the picture.

368
00:30:49,159 --> 00:31:01,640
If you start asking, well, how am I when I think and sit at home and do the cogito and have an autobiography and have a breakdown and so forth, you won't find the phenomena.

369
00:31:01,879 --> 00:31:12,440
To find the phenomena, you've got to try to capture your unreflective, ongoing, successful, involved coping.

370
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,559
Then, then you get it.

371
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:14,119
Yeah.

372
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:18,239
So just to be clear, from what you said is going to be a comfortable understanding of things.

373
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,359
Good.

374
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,399
Good.

375
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:20,959
Yes.

376
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,600
And Meryl-Ponty's, there's the transcendence of motor intentionality which puts them together.

377
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:26,880
Wouldn't that be nice?

378
00:31:26,879 --> 00:31:28,079
I think that's just wonderful.

379
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:29,040
We can all just go home.

380
00:31:23,879 --> 00:31:30,160
That's a thought for the day.

381
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,240
But I have other thoughts, so we better go on.

382
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:46,399
It turns out that at the end of the cogito chapter, when he's finally putting it all together, he starts saying things like this, though they're pretty obscure.

383
00:31:46,399 --> 00:32:03,520
I think if you look at them now in the light of the special kind of openness I got, namely the openness that is being drawn into the coping with things and constantly revealing more and more about them, then you get the tacit cogito.

384
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,639
Remember, I just said something, but I didn't explain it.

385
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:13,199
The tacit cogito is the experience you got when you're doing your motor intentional thing, so to speak.

386
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,680
It's not the reflective cogito.

387
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:22,639
It's not an I think that's thinking about itself, which is a Descartes kind of reflection.

388
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:27,839
It's not a cogito put into words, which is also Cartesian.

389
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,400
The I think as a Cartesian concept.

390
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,520
It's supposed to be the tacit cogito.

391
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:43,119
That means the cogito which is in my most fundamental experience.

392
00:32:43,119 --> 00:33:02,559
And that's what he's trying to get at in the end, because the chapter is aiming at getting to the tacit cogito, which is in another sense you could say, well, what is Merrill-Ponty substituting for Descartes' most basic sense of myself doing my most basic essential thing?

393
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:07,199
Whatever that is, that's going to be Merrill-Ponty's cogito.

394
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:19,479
And it's going to be whatever it is that goes on in this unreflective, pre-linguistic, or at least it doesn't need to be linguistic, absorbed COVID.

395
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,839
Okay, now let's read the 474.

396
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:25,399
about five lines down starting on the right.

397
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:55,720
I am not myself a succession of psychic acts with the clipper thought, nor for that matter a nuclear I who brings them together into a synthetic unity, Kant thought, but one single experience inseparable from itself, one single living cohesion, one temporality engaged from birth and making itself progressively exquisite and confirming that cohesion in each successive present.

398
00:33:55,719 --> 00:34:04,040
That's the ongoing COVID, presumably, trying to always get a maximum or a more maximum grip on yourself and the world.

399
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:10,599
And it is this advent, or again, this transcendental event that the Cogel retrieves.

400
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:15,559
Look, I put in that extra sentence, that is the tacit cogito.

401
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:18,280
And why is it a transcendental event?

402
00:34:18,279 --> 00:34:23,799
Well, since all the well, all the round of the word transcendental, I thought I would just throw this last one.

403
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:31,399
Remember, transcendental can mean transcendental can mean the condition of the possibility of the experience of objects.

404
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,920
That's Kant's definition.

405
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,919
And I think he's taking that from Kant, taking it over Kant.

406
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:49,800
The transcendental event, that is the condition of the possibility of my experience of perceptual objects, is ongoing COVID toward attaining an optimal grip, I think.

407
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:56,319
And that now I want to do one more, and again on 475, about five lines.

408
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,519
Let's start on the far one, two, three, four, five, six, six, seven.

409
00:35:01,759 --> 00:35:05,360
475, seven lines down.

410
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:20,000
My existence on the right side in the middle of the sentence, my existence as subjectivity is merely one with my existence as a body and with the existence of the world.

411
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,799
The subjectivity is the Cartesian subject.

412
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:29,200
Now it's being turned into the way the body and the world exist.

413
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:36,720
And you can use the Heidegger slogan that's sort of my existence is the world, or I'm the world existingly.

414
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:51,120
And because the subject I am, you see, he's taking the word subject now away from Descartes, when taken concretely and unreflectively, is inseparable from this body and this world.

415
00:35:51,119 --> 00:36:04,320
The ontological world and body, which we find at the core of the subject, are not the world or the body as idea, but on the one hand, the world itself contracted into a comprehensive grasp.

416
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,840
And on the other, the body itself as knowing body.

417
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:15,919
Knowing body, you've got to read as know-how body, as skilled body, as grasping body.

418
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,599
Would have been nicer if I said that.

419
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:18,959
This is how I would read it.

420
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:26,160
So there's the world itself as graspable, always more optimally, always more explicitly.

421
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:39,000
And there's me as grasping it, always more optimally and more explicitly, or at least moving toward that, drawn toward that by the normativity of the whole thing.

422
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,880
Okay, now, yeah, I will kind of come back to that, so you needn't look too puzzled.

423
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:45,000
Well, but I see I have another one.

424
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:57,480
This all shows up again at the end of my lecture if I had time, because I jumped to the tacit Togijo that I thought it was the right thing to do, given that we are in the transcendence business.

425
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,840
Okay, I see that I want to do something also on 438.

426
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:08,120
Again, I'm still trying to get you to get used to the word transcendence.

427
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:20,760
And so, when he says about eight lines down, there is no sphere of imminence, that put the little car, no realm in which my consciousness is fully at home and secure against all risk of error.

428
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:25,640
That would be the sphere of imminence, would be the sphere that you transcend.

429
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,280
And this is the view he's against, of course.

430
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:31,880
There is no imminence, and in that sense, no transcendence.

431
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:38,920
The acts of the I are of such a nature that they outstrip themselves, leaving no interiority of consciousness.

432
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,760
That's the open head story.

433
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:46,119
Consciousness is transcendent through and through, not transcendence undergone.

434
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,880
Well, that's there.

435
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,480
He is, that's how you see he takes the word away from Husserl.

436
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,439
It's not imminence except transcendence.

437
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,160
It's all transcendence all the time.

438
00:37:57,159 --> 00:38:02,200
That means already, always, already absorbed in the things it's coping with.

439
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:04,759
That's transcendence undergone.

440
00:38:04,759 --> 00:38:10,279
It's just, again, the way he's, I want to show you how he's taking over this idea.

441
00:38:10,759 --> 00:38:22,280
One last thing where he, because I'm still trying to say he's putting Husserl and Heidegger together, not the Husserl imminence transcendent, but the Husserl who thinks there's always more to the object than you can perceive.

442
00:38:22,279 --> 00:38:26,639
He's putting that together with us who are always absorbed in that.

443
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:55,440
So about a little below the middle of 438, roughly four words in from the left, vision is an action, not that it is internal operation, but an operation which fulfills more than it promises, which constantly outruns the premises, and is inwardly prepared only by my primordial opening upon the world, upon a field of transcendence that is once again an ex-daz.

444
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:04,559
I picked that sentence because it seems to bring together the opening of a field which has more and more and more in it.

445
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:09,680
That's the husseral aspect of it, the opening of a field of transcendence.

446
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:11,759
And then there's the Heidegger aspect of it.

447
00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:18,880
It's an ex-das, where that always needs the outside itself openness.

448
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,000
Okay, well, I thought that was extremely worthwhile, and I'm glad I was pushed on it.

449
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,440
You can go push it more further.

450
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,799
If so, I'm happy to do it, because I think that's all extremely illuminating.

451
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,440
Yeah.

452
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:34,079
Do you think there's creating France Homes, Mark?

453
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,200
No.

454
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,919
That's wonderful, though, that you should say that.

455
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,479
No, it's the absolute opposite.

456
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,759
But I'm glad you mentioned it.

457
00:39:41,759 --> 00:40:10,999
Brentano is the perfect example of the really sensible, original use of transcendence, where the mind goes out to the world and there is in the mind a representation of the world, which is directed toward the object in the world, and that kind of intentionality, which goes from Brentano to Husserl to Searle, which is representational intentionality, is exactly what Merrill-Ponty is.

458
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:22,199
And I don't want to say denying, because he's perfectly happy to say, of course, we've got beliefs, which have representational content that are about, say, trees.

459
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:39,240
And we can also, I imagine, just stare at the tree and have a visual experience of it, which is directed towards it and successfully represents it.

460
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,160
That can be done.

461
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:48,360
That's what Searle's whole brilliant book, Intentionality, spells out in great detail.

462
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,480
And I think Merlot-Ponty would say, gets it right.

463
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:58,520
But Merrill-Ponty wants to say, and this is now why he's disagreeing with Brentano, motor intentionality isn't like that.

464
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,239
It is always already outside itself.

465
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:03,559
It doesn't have a representation.

466
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:08,520
It's just there in the level in which we are coping.

467
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:16,200
It only looks the way it looks to Brentano and Searle and Husserl when you reflect on it.

468
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:17,879
Well, that's too sudden.

469
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:35,960
It either looks that way when you're analyzing thought and reflection, because beliefs do have intentional content and are directed, or it looks that, and that's fine, or it looks that way when you reflect on perception.

470
00:41:36,279 --> 00:41:46,599
And then you think that perception is having a visual experience that has certain intentional content and can be true or false of the world.

471
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:48,280
And that's a mistake.

472
00:41:49,000 --> 00:42:04,240
For Merlot-Ponty, if you think that what you's revealed about perception on reflection is the bottom-level analysis of perception, you misunderstood perception.

473
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:11,599
And remember, I said that there were three objections to Descartes in what Merlot-Ponty is doing.

474
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:18,320
One, all the time he spent last time on sense data and whether there were any and whether they were indubitable.

475
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:24,320
Now we've got another one, and there are three, but we'll skip one for the moment.

476
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:29,360
Another one is whether the I think transforms our experience.

477
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:41,440
And I'm saying now that Mero-Ponty wants to say, yes, whenever you reflect and think, you transform the basic motor-intentional coping experience.

478
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:48,559
And likewise, when you reflect on perception, you transform the perception experience.

479
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:50,960
And so let's go directly to that.

480
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:59,920
Just in case you have an outline in front of you from last time, the three issues were the indubitableness of sensation.

481
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,960
That's done.

482
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,120
The next I'm going to get to, if there's time, is the transparency of thought.

483
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,280
I skipped that one for the time being.

484
00:43:07,279 --> 00:43:12,479
And the last of them is whether the I think transforms our experience or not.

485
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,400
Since you got us into Brentano, I don't see why we shouldn't do it.

486
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,719
There's nothing magical about the order.

487
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:20,320
Let's just do that.

488
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:37,360
So the claim is that what you discover about consciousness and experience on reflection is that changes that experience radically.

489
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:42,040
The person who's got the best account of this, if anybody gets really interested in this, is Sartre.

490
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:51,799
One of the first things he wrote when he was at his, he was sort of downhill all his life was Sartre, I think, getting more and more away from the phenomenon.

491
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,679
He wrote this brilliant book, The Transcendence of the Ego.

492
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:56,840
It isn't even a book, it's just a paper.

493
00:43:57,159 --> 00:44:04,599
And in there, he's got a whole story about how reflection radically transforms the structure of the experience.

494
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:07,079
And it sounds very Merlot-Fonte-like.

495
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:09,960
It goes, I'm here counting my cigarettes.

496
00:44:10,279 --> 00:44:12,360
Start was a change smoker.

497
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:17,000
And I'm absorbed in counting my cigarettes.

498
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,400
And then, I don't know, I forget what happens.

499
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,720
Something happens and I reflect.

500
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:26,599
So far, the good thing is there's counting of cigarettes that's going on.

501
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:27,479
And that's it.

502
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,120
Just absorb one cigarette after another.

503
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:34,840
And then when I reflect, there becomes I'm counting my cigarettes.

504
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:42,199
And there's an ego and an object, or a subject and an object in the experience.

505
00:44:42,199 --> 00:44:50,599
And then he has a whole book about how the ego is constructed and how at the ground level there really isn't any me and there really isn't any I.

506
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:52,680
There's just absorbed coping.

507
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:56,279
And he has the whole Heidegger Merlot-Fonte picture.

508
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:07,800
Because all I'm telling you this story for is so you can get an idea of why somebody might want to say that reflection radically transforms experience.

509
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:21,800
So, and it would be a mistake to say, and he's got lots to say about that, well, there was an ego there all along, unconsciously or marginally or whatever, necess but philosophically, necessarily, to unify it.

510
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,040
There must have been an ego there all along.

511
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:32,240
And Sartre just thinks, shoots down those positions one by one and says, no, if you're true to the phenomena, you will see that there was no ego there.

512
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:35,199
Now, I want to say one more thing, which you might be after, so I'll let you talk first.

513
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:37,040
There's an open, a loose end here.

514
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:37,920
Oh, we're not.

515
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:41,279
The question is, how are you going to talk about the unreflective one?

516
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,559
No, that is the right question.

517
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:43,440
I saw it in your eyes.

518
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,440
That's exactly the next question.

519
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:52,559
And the answer, and Sartre thinks hard about that and comes up with an answer that nobody else has taken up.

520
00:45:52,559 --> 00:46:00,880
I don't know whether they all just believe it or nobody believes it, but his answer is you've got something which he calls pure reflection.

521
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:08,639
And pure reflection is catching in your memory how it was just before you reflected on it.

522
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,720
That's how he knows he was absorbed.

523
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:19,680
He can get back to the experience of being absorbed in the cigarettes before he reflected on it because it's been his, it's recorded that way.

524
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:21,759
Now, if you like that, that's great.

525
00:46:21,759 --> 00:46:26,000
And if you don't, you've got a real problem how you can deal with unreflected experience.

526
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,159
I don't know what to say about Merlot-Ponty.

527
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:29,679
He seems to think it's no problem.

528
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:35,519
He constantly is describing his unreflected, absorbed.

529
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:39,599
I guess I think that everybody's doing what Sard thinks.

530
00:46:39,759 --> 00:46:50,000
I mean, you have to ask yourself, how was it a minute ago before something broke down or when I was climbing this cliff and I was indistinguishable?

531
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:56,000
People say that, mountain climbers, that when I'm climbing a cliff, there's no distinction between me and the cliff.

532
00:46:56,159 --> 00:46:57,440
How do they know it?

533
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,640
That's the question.

534
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:00,960
Because as soon as they reflect, there is.

535
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,400
I think they're just doing what Sartre made a kind of methodological thing out.

536
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,879
They can remember what it was like.

537
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,919
But there are two kinds of memories, Sartre things, pure and impure.

538
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:14,919
The pure one is to capture in memory how it was before it happened.

539
00:47:15,159 --> 00:47:24,040
But there is this retroactive thing that pretty soon you can't even remember how it was until without an ego, and that's impure reflection.

540
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:32,920
And then you have to get trained as a good phenomenologist, maybe, or maybe it's just locked if you've managed to capture the pure reflection.

541
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,520
Okay, so now where am I?

542
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:40,920
Okay, I'm going to show you the pages where he says reflection is derivative.

543
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,679
Huh, that's funny.

544
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:45,079
I said 345, didn't I?

545
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:46,679
And it is non-future.

546
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,320
Well, let me see if it's even distinct.

547
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:53,240
Ah, yes, it's 445.

548
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:54,200
I bet.

549
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:58,360
Yes, but let me fix it in my notes.

550
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:04,199
Okay, 445, about 10 lines from the bottom.

551
00:48:04,199 --> 00:48:08,760
It is through my relation to things that I know myself.

552
00:48:08,759 --> 00:48:17,880
That's me finding myself as a motor intentional something or other in the motor intentional activity.

553
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:27,320
Inner perception follows afterwards and would not be possible had I not already made contact with my doubt and its very object.

554
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,839
Doubt and its object is in the middle of Descartes, never mind.

555
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:34,199
Just stop with inner perception follows afterward.

556
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:43,000
What's really interesting about that is it's like I wish I could find, I'm not sure that's, give me a second.

557
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:52,279
There's a place where I wrote Seral Visual Experience in the margin, which is a clearer version of that very same claim.

558
00:48:52,279 --> 00:48:55,840
Ah, the look, this book at the bottom of 471.

559
00:48:56,159 --> 00:48:57,040
Put the two together.

560
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:58,159
I'll keep your fingers out.

561
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:14,320
You see, what I'm saying is that this is a claim that there's something more basic going on and an inner perception, which would be like me having my own private visual experience with its intentional content and you have your visual experience.

562
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:18,559
And we could have, you know, sort of very similar visual experiences.

563
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:22,480
We both look out the window and see the beautiful live oak.

564
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,079
But yours is yours and mine is mine.

565
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,760
That's what Merlot Ponty is trying to deny.

566
00:49:29,759 --> 00:49:39,280
But I think it's clearer on 471, where we can hear more about Peter and Paul or Paul and Merlot looking at the landscape.

567
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,360
Let's, about 20 lines from the bottom.

568
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:49,360
Suppose that my friend Paul and I are looking at a landscape, what precisely happens?

569
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,759
And how many have had self-invisual experiences?

570
00:49:51,759 --> 00:49:54,480
I don't want to totally waste my time talking to you all.

571
00:49:54,639 --> 00:50:00,239
Anyway, it's so commonsensical what Searle is saying about visual experiences.

572
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:07,119
You can have it without having read him, because after all, Merlot-Ponty is writing about it without having read him.

573
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:13,440
Must it be said that we both have private sensations that I think are the visual experiences?

574
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,879
That we know things but cannot communicate them to each other.

575
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:24,240
That as far as pure lived experience goes, we are each incarcerated in our separate perspectives.

576
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:27,199
That the landscape is not numerically the same for both of us.

577
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:29,839
That it was a question only a specific identity.

578
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:35,040
That is, you see your experience of the landscape, which is your experience.

579
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,120
I mean, you know, it's hard to deny this.

580
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:39,040
It's such a complicated little story.

581
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:50,599
How to describe the difference between your perspective and my perspective without saying you're having a private experience of the object from here and I'm having a private experience of an object from there.

582
00:50:50,599 --> 00:50:55,480
And this is certainly what Merlot Ponte wants to constantly say is not the phenomenon.

583
00:50:55,480 --> 00:51:01,719
And I gather why it seems so hard to get it is because you constantly reflect.

584
00:51:01,719 --> 00:51:12,200
And when you reflect, your experience is transformed into you've got your perspective, which is a private experience going on in your mind, and I've got mine.

585
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:16,599
And it's very hard to capture this previous thing.

586
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:17,800
But let's go on.

587
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:28,040
When I consider my perception itself, before any objectifying reflection, all reflection is going to turn everything into objects.

588
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:38,680
There's the eye, which is a kind of object, and the object I'm seeing, which is a kind of object, and the visual experience, which is a kind of object, all coming to spring up when you reflect.

589
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:49,320
Before any objective reflection, if I get that, then you see that at no moment am I aware of being shut up within my own sensations.

590
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:55,400
Now, maybe I'm wrong, but I take those sensations to be what Searle calls visual experiences.

591
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:12,519
Whether they are or aren't, you can get your own sense of this, just reflect and think that you are having your visual experience of me up here in front, I'm having my visual experiences with you over there, and it's hard to even make sense of the view.

592
00:52:12,679 --> 00:52:16,920
We're just empty on the world, and we're not having visual experiences at all.

593
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:22,120
We're just in direct contact with the world and objects and people and coping.

594
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:25,760
It's so, I mean, I don't know about you, but I'm torn both ways.

595
00:52:25,759 --> 00:52:45,359
And the way to see why you're torn both ways is when you're involved in coping, and when you're describing from the motor intentionality perspective, you're just open to the world, and there it is, and you don't have a visual experience and a perspective, you're just open to the object, and you're exploring that object.

596
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:49,280
And Peter standing next to you is exploring the same object.

597
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:53,120
And as soon as you think about it, it doesn't look that way.

598
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,400
And my, you know, I point out to each other certain details.

599
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:05,919
And Paul's finger, which is pointing out the church, is not a finger for me that I think of as oriented toward the George Tower.

600
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,199
I'm not having a visual experience of his finger either.

601
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:17,440
Or I'm just seeing his finger, and the finger shows me the tower that Paul sees, and so forth and so forth.

602
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:25,119
He goes on and on trying to get you to see it that way and realize if that's how you normally see it.

603
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,119
Why am I talking about this?

604
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:33,439
Oh, because reflecting on it turns it into private experiences of subjects.

605
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,680
And he's trying, and I remember where I am now.

606
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:45,599
And the Cartesian mistake is to believe that when you reflect on it, you don't transform it.

607
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,960
You just see it as it was all along.

608
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,759
Only you were so busy coping you didn't notice.

609
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,719
You were always the subject of having visual experiences.

610
00:53:54,719 --> 00:53:56,880
You were having mine.

611
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,559
That's what I'm talking about.

612
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:01,040
And I'm saying on 471 you get that.

613
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,000
And on 472, you get it again.

614
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,760
About 50 lines from the bottom.

615
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:11,000
Something is understood immediately.

616
00:54:11,159 --> 00:54:20,840
The world, subject, and so forth will never be understood as long as the world is made into an object, something thrown over against me.

617
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:28,520
It is understood immediately that the world is the field of our experience, and if we are nothing but a view of the world.

618
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:35,800
Well, of course, he says it over and over and over, and I just read it over and over and over because it's the crucial point.

619
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:42,760
So only on reflection do you get out of this difference of being a field open.

620
00:54:42,759 --> 00:54:48,440
And then I want to say, people who hold views like Searles aren't wrong.

621
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:57,000
They're just not on the ground level of where we are openly, just to say something different for kings, responding to the affordances.

622
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,760
They are always on the level of either breakdown or reflection.

623
00:55:02,759 --> 00:55:06,679
Or maybe they come together, however, or reflection is a kind of breakdown.

624
00:55:06,759 --> 00:55:08,839
You can cut it up in lots of different ways.

625
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:09,239
Yeah.

626
00:55:09,559 --> 00:55:18,920
Well, I think what you just said was problematic, and there was a sense in which Merlot wants to agree that reflection happens.

627
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:25,559
But I think he also wants to say that there is something completely wrong with the creativist conjugator.

628
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:34,040
In other words, specifically that there really are no private sensations if I am an empty head.

629
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:37,160
Okay, well, that's very interesting and important.

630
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:39,719
I don't, I mean, let's straight state the problem.

631
00:55:39,759 --> 00:55:40,919
I mean, I said.

632
00:55:41,040 --> 00:56:01,200
Is he saying, when he says that we are empty heads turned towards the world, the way I was reading it, when we are at our best, when we are motor-intentional beings, when we are doing what it is to be a Daseine or a motor-intentional being, we certainly don't have any of that.

633
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:10,319
But I would have thought he would say, in the cases of breakdown, then, well, we know, okay, this is still further.

634
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:18,000
And I think we all agree that you can get yourself into a frame of mind in which you think you've got an inner and you've got visual experiences.

635
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,199
I mean, Searle certainly wasn't sort of wasting his time.

636
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:24,639
He was really thinking about something, and Brentano and Bussero.

637
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:27,040
You can get yourself into that frame of mind.

638
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:51,200
And now Rick is asking the question, does Meryl-Ponti think that what you see on reflection is, as I'm saying, derivative and sort of parasitical on your experience of motor intentionality and a radical transformation of it and can't be read back as the truth that was going on or what was going on all along?

639
00:56:51,199 --> 00:57:05,840
Or is he saying something much stronger, that the whole tradition that there is a mind with visual experiences in it and pains in it and beliefs in it which are separate from the world and directed toward the world is just wrong?

640
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:07,439
You think he's saying that?

641
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,880
Yeah, so he's not going to say that you don't have a pain.

642
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:11,040
Yeah.

643
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:19,280
Well, I suppose we could cut that up too and say, well, it's not in the world.

644
00:57:19,279 --> 00:57:31,040
And if you think the mind, if you make the sort of mind just the place for stuff that is really private and not in the public world, like your headache isn't accessible to me and mine to you.

645
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,880
Well, I'm in there.

646
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,400
Okay, good.

647
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,599
Well, but do we have visual experiences?

648
00:57:38,599 --> 00:57:42,359
And are we just arguing about whether we should call them inner or private?

649
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:45,880
Or has he done a strong claim that we don't have visual experiences?

650
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,199
I think it's, well, neither.

651
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:52,199
I think it's specifically, I can make my point logically without referring to the phenomenon.

652
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:52,759
Okay.

653
00:57:53,079 --> 00:58:00,120
There is either outer distinctions in a kind of robust sense, or there isn't.

654
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:16,759
And it seems like when we're ONC, our own kind of misunderstanding of transcendence, being in the world, and how I'm going to get outside myself, or something like that, that there is no, you know, ONC that he does care about inner-house, or like love, for example, out of the inner.

655
00:58:17,239 --> 00:58:17,960
Well, but he doesn't.

656
00:58:18,279 --> 00:58:20,119
But that's kind of non-problematic.

657
00:58:20,119 --> 00:58:20,359
Okay.

658
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,599
Well, yes, let me let me hear us.

659
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:24,439
Don't get confused or lost.

660
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,359
This is all easily understood.

661
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:30,519
Maybe it isn't even a paper topic, although easily understood is probably.

662
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:40,599
But it's not a Cartesian inner, a self-sufficient sphere of contents.

663
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:49,480
It's always derivative from, and as I said, parasitical on the motor intentional level.

664
00:58:49,480 --> 00:59:04,840
But and that you wouldn't be having private experiences at all if you weren't already a conscious being aware of its self as coping and dealing with things.

665
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:26,159
But that doesn't mean that you have to give up the idea that there is, and if you don't want to call it in the mind, you just have to say, at least there is a kind of experience which you have on breakdown and on reflection, which is not the kind of experience you have when you're coping with things in a public world.

666
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:27,119
That's all I think he's saying.

667
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:31,520
Okay, well, I'm not objecting to that, and I don't need to say, I don't think you should say more.

668
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,880
In fact, I read the line in order to support that.

669
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:44,079
That, yes, there is, but then that means that he's not denying that there can be situations in which you can have visual experiences.

670
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:54,480
You just don't want to call them inner, and you don't want to think that they're self-sufficient and that they are your genuine, true access to the perception of the world.

671
00:59:54,480 --> 01:00:02,000
They are some kind of peculiar breakdown or entity produced by reflection.

672
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:02,799
That's all right.

673
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,719
I mean, but you don't, so we're green, I think.

674
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:16,559
I mean, he's denying that they are always there, private visual experiences and mental content.

675
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:35,440
And he's denying that what you discover when you do come across such things, which I think he thinks exists, you don't discover something that has been there all along and is the basis of perception and action, like intention and action and talk, like Searle.

676
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:40,319
Yeah, Jennifer, as the authority on Searle, I'm going to tell you, I hope you can go ahead then.

677
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,400
Okay, so if experiences are neither inner nor out.

678
01:00:45,279 --> 01:00:48,079
I think, see, now it's so hard to talk about all this.

679
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:50,079
I think there are inner experiences.

680
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:51,919
I mean, it's just a question of words now.

681
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,439
Don't panic.

682
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,840
I mean, there are experiences, and reflection is among them.

683
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:03,439
Belief, reflection, visual experiences, intentions and action.

684
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,359
I mean, go to Searle to find.

685
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:10,279
And Glycerl thinks sensations, Merlo Bunty thinks that's a wrong move.

686
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,079
There aren't any.

687
01:01:12,759 --> 01:01:30,920
But there's a lot of not in the shared public world and don't have any place when you're fully involved in coping, when you are an open field of motor intentional activity.

688
01:01:33,559 --> 01:01:36,280
But there are these experiences.

689
01:01:36,279 --> 01:01:39,399
And we can call them inner, or that might be misleading.

690
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,880
You could say they're mental.

691
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,320
That might be better.

692
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:50,760
Usually people say in the mind, and then you've got maybe bad ideas, too much Cartesian.

693
01:01:50,759 --> 01:01:56,200
But there is a mental bunch of stuff, and reflection is in it, and a lot of experience is in it.

694
01:01:56,199 --> 01:02:01,880
There's one, and even, I'll sort of give you one of my trump cards, I think.

695
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:19,079
If you're looking for the tacit cogito and you're looking for anything that we've got that is intrinsically private and basic and takes the place of all the stuff that has been assumed to be intrinsic and private and basic, what could it be?

696
01:02:19,719 --> 01:02:21,800
I think I know the answer to that.

697
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,439
I hope I'm right because it's very interesting.

698
01:02:24,759 --> 01:02:27,640
And if I'm not, I'd be very unhappy.

699
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:48,440
I think that what he's groping for and practically says at the end of the Coke-Toe chapter is, but he never says it explicitly, is, well, what is the private something that I've got when I'm acting motor intentionally and is not the result of perception and is pre-linguistic?

700
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:51,559
It's a sense that things are going all right or not.

701
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:52,839
That's private.

702
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:56,160
Nobody, each of us has his own or her own.

703
01:02:57,199 --> 01:03:02,320
You might be able to see the house from the same perspective I see the house, but you can't have my sense.

704
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:07,120
It's sort of what headaches are supposed to be, only whereas headaches are utterly unimportant.

705
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:12,239
My normative sense of whether things are going well or not is foundational.

706
01:03:12,239 --> 01:03:13,679
If anything, it's foundational.

707
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:15,280
It's rock bottom.

708
01:03:15,279 --> 01:03:18,559
It explains a lot of other aspects of experience.

709
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:20,800
It's totally private.

710
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,920
It would make no sense to say it's in the mind.

711
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:27,119
But that's not what he's trying to do.

712
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:29,759
He's trying to say, what is the tacit cogito?

713
01:03:29,759 --> 01:03:31,759
What truth is there in Descartes?

714
01:03:31,759 --> 01:03:38,479
Is there anything important and private that we can get at to talk about?

715
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,480
And the answer is yes.

716
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,800
We have a sense of how it's going.

717
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,199
That's absolutely crucial.

718
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:48,480
That's the movement for toward and away from optimal grip.

719
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:53,520
You can't understand perception or action or motor intentionality without it.

720
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,759
I think that's the tacit cogito.

721
01:03:55,759 --> 01:03:58,960
I'm not sure because I looked and looked and there's no line that says it.

722
01:03:59,199 --> 01:03:59,679
Yeah.

723
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:02,559
Oh, yes, I can, I think.

724
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:09,999
Private are things that I sort of accidentally know and you don't know, like things in my autobiography.

725
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:20,319
Like it's private that, let's say it would be private if I was keeping it a secret that some bad thing happened to I did some bad thing in my childhood or something.

726
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,960
I never told anybody, and I'm not going to tell anybody.

727
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,480
That's private.

728
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,480
But it's not intrinsically private.

729
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,400
I can tell anybody.

730
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:33,679
And in therapy, maybe my therapist could figure it out without I ever even telling him.

731
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:37,040
So that's important.

732
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:41,960
There are lots of stuff about that I don't know about you and you don't know about me.

733
01:04:42,279 --> 01:04:49,960
But the question is for philosophers: is there anything that is intrinsically, essentially private?

734
01:04:50,520 --> 01:05:01,160
And then you think, well, maybe your visual experiences, your intentions in action, your desires, your feelings like love.

735
01:05:01,159 --> 01:05:05,079
Those are all candidates for what is intrinsically private.

736
01:05:05,079 --> 01:05:09,960
And Maryland Paul Fielmans is saying, no, none of that is.

737
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:18,199
That is, I can't have your love, but it isn't somehow a secret you can keep.

738
01:05:18,199 --> 01:05:19,960
I mean, I can see whether you're in love.

739
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:23,320
I might even be able to do it better than you can tell whether you're in love.

740
01:05:26,679 --> 01:05:33,480
So I don't know if there's anything intrinsically private, according to Maryland Conte.

741
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,480
I got two choices.

742
01:05:38,119 --> 01:05:41,960
I think there is lots that's intrinsically private, according to Maryland.

743
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,799
And maybe, I think we're disagreeing with you.

744
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,159
No, that's where I was disagreeing with.

745
01:05:45,239 --> 01:05:46,119
No, no, no, no.

746
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:50,760
Because surely you don't want to say the pains aren't intrinsically private, do you?

747
01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:54,360
And I think my pains are intrinsically private.

748
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:54,920
I think mine.

749
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,079
I didn't say private is the only thing.

750
01:05:58,440 --> 01:05:59,639
I can't feel your pains.

751
01:05:59,719 --> 01:06:01,639
It's a little dirty word when you say that it's private.

752
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:02,440
Thank you.

753
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:03,239
Well, I don't know.

754
01:06:03,239 --> 01:06:04,839
I can't feel your pains.

755
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:06,759
They become my pains.

756
01:06:07,719 --> 01:06:14,200
And my tickles and itches, and to add a whole bunch of other things that Austin adds when he talks about these things.

757
01:06:14,199 --> 01:06:19,559
I think the issue is supposed to be not whether they're private, but whether they're important.

758
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:33,919
And the idea, I think, but I'm not sure, is really, and I think this is Austin too, there's a lot of sort of private garbage around, tickles, itches, and pains and so forth, that they just don't do any important role.

759
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:39,759
You can't ground knowledge in them, you can't ground your understanding of other minds in them.

760
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:45,199
But all the important stuff, I'm going to take this back in a minute.

761
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:48,319
All the important stuff isn't private.

762
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:56,879
It's something that you could tell me, or I could find out about you, even you might not know it about you, or there are facts about you that somebody might well know.

763
01:06:57,279 --> 01:07:00,000
But all that stuff isn't private.

764
01:07:00,239 --> 01:07:05,679
So the collection of stuff that's private is just not interesting.

765
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:08,960
Maybe your dreams are in this private area.

766
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:11,679
Maybe your intentions are in this private area.

767
01:07:11,679 --> 01:07:14,239
I'm not sure about that, because I can sometimes tell.

768
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:18,960
By Louise, do anybody read Ryle's concept of mind anymore in any course?

769
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:32,399
I mean, the book that tries to show what I'm just saying, more than any other book, is Gilbert Ryle's The Concept of Mind, where he's out to get Descartes and the whole idea that there's anything private.

770
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,360
He has to, even he tries to get rid of pains.

771
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:39,040
Oh, I want to say one more thing, though, so I don't seem to kind of hit myself and then you guys.

772
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:48,400
Because I want to say that I think that Meryl Oponte thinks that there is something intrinsically private and important.

773
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:53,920
And that's your moving toward your sense of whether you're moving toward an optimal or away from an optimal.

774
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:58,319
That that's got to be built in on the ground floor of motor intentionality.

775
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:06,399
And I have mine, and you have yours, and there's no, it's not the kind of thing you could ever communicate, your feeling of whether you're getting a better grip or not.

776
01:08:06,399 --> 01:08:12,519
And it's not trivial garbage, like that's the tacit cogito, I think.

777
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:15,319
And I have, I would love to get feedback about this.

778
01:08:16,119 --> 01:08:21,559
Not as many people are coming to office hours anymore if that's how they'd be going, you know, help me, please do.

779
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:22,359
Yeah, Al.

780
01:08:22,359 --> 01:08:26,599
I don't understand the nature of the thing that that's the tacit cogito.

781
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:37,559
What content do you think?

782
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:38,519
No, I see.

783
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:39,800
Well, good, good.

784
01:08:40,119 --> 01:08:53,559
See, I take him to be saying that the I think, which is the cogito, is a special experience that Descartes was analyzing.

785
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:57,559
And I don't want to go into now how much of it is private or not, or inner or not.

786
01:08:58,199 --> 01:09:12,839
Whatever it is that Descartes is talking about under the Cogito, the I think, it's supposed to be indubitable, it's supposed to be transparent, it's supposed to be foundational in that it's your sense of what's really going on.

787
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:15,399
You're seeming to see, you're seeming to think, and so forth.

788
01:09:15,399 --> 01:09:17,639
It's rock bottom and so forth.

789
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:21,159
And clearly, the tacit cogito is not that.

790
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:31,399
But it's also supposed to be something that is the sort of deepest thing about me, the cogito.

791
01:09:31,399 --> 01:09:34,439
I mean, I find in there the I think.

792
01:09:34,439 --> 01:09:43,079
Now, what is there that is really about me and private, foundational?

793
01:09:43,399 --> 01:09:46,040
That would be, I think, the tacit cogito.

794
01:09:46,119 --> 01:09:58,960
The tacit cogito certainly isn't how am I sort of unthematically and implicitly doing an I think, because then that would be something Mary LaPonte wouldn't want to say in a million years.

795
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:01,920
But he's trying to find the tacit cogito.

796
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:02,880
He says that.

797
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:16,319
And he says it, you know, I happen to know because I came across it the first time he says it, I think, is at the 282 at the end of no, that's not it.

798
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:18,239
I may get to the end of this first chapter.

799
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:19,119
If it isn't, I give up.

800
01:10:19,359 --> 01:10:22,000
But there was 240 points ahead to it.

801
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:22,960
Yeah, here it is.

802
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,599
On 347, the very last.

803
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,439
There is a world for me because I'm not unaware of myself.

804
01:10:29,439 --> 01:10:36,719
See, he's trying to get some kind of an awareness which is not reflective and yet involved in there being a world.

805
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:39,599
And I'm not concealed for myself because I have a world.

806
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:45,679
This pre-conscious possession of the world remains to be analyzed in the pre-reflective cogito.

807
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:46,960
I take it several things.

808
01:10:46,960 --> 01:11:10,399
The pre-reflective cogito is the same as the tacit cogito, that it's what he's talking about in the chapter called the cogito, and that it got to do with some way that I am aware of myself and something very important about me that Descartes was getting at wrongly, but we have to get the right phenomenology.

809
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:17,519
I was confused, though, that the phrase the cogito is sometimes used as the proper name for Descartes.

810
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:18,800
Descartes come on to music.

811
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:20,960
Okay, yes.

812
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:22,479
Well, that's not what happens.

813
01:11:25,359 --> 01:11:30,799
The basic experience of myself that I have when I'm doing motor infectionality.

814
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,399
That's what is enjoyable.

815
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,079
So if I'm doing the leading stable.

816
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:39,000
My feelings are going well or badly, therefore, that there is.

817
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:40,840
There is something.

818
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,279
I mean, the eye of venue.

819
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:44,119
It's going well or badly.

820
01:11:44,439 --> 01:11:46,599
I don't even know if you can really say for me.

821
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:49,079
I think the bottom line is it's going well or badly.

822
01:11:49,079 --> 01:11:50,439
Balance is in jeopardy.

823
01:11:50,439 --> 01:11:52,119
There's more people exist.

824
01:11:52,439 --> 01:11:52,599
Right.

825
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:54,119
Yeah.

826
01:11:55,640 --> 01:12:03,559
I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but it seems that everyone has their own, you know, passive coping feeling.

827
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:09,720
They're dealing with their environment as individuals and just absorbed coping as individuals.

828
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:18,199
Each and every one of us has this own way of dealing with the world that no one has the unique copy of it.

829
01:12:18,519 --> 01:12:21,399
Well, everyone has something.

830
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,800
I'm not sure, but I disagree before that.

831
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,599
You turned it into a style of coping.

832
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:29,079
And it's true, I think, that there are two things.

833
01:12:29,079 --> 01:12:32,359
Each of us have our own individual style of coping.

834
01:12:32,359 --> 01:12:37,000
But I think that's not inner enough.

835
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,079
I mean, you see my style of coping.

836
01:12:39,079 --> 01:12:49,719
In fact, you may see better my style of coping and see how the way I talk and the way I move and the way I write and so forth all has a common style of coping.

837
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:55,159
But I don't think that's inner, quote, unquote, enough, private enough.

838
01:12:55,399 --> 01:13:02,599
But I think my sense of how it's going, whether I'm moving toward or away from an optimal grip, that's private.

839
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:08,599
But it isn't, it doesn't have to be sort of idiosyncratic and individual like the style.

840
01:13:09,399 --> 01:13:13,319
But you know how you're doing is only no.

841
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:14,920
I'm glad you're saying that.

842
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:18,119
I mean, that people have to say brave things and be wrong.

843
01:13:18,119 --> 01:13:21,079
No, I mean, that's exactly wrong.

844
01:13:21,079 --> 01:13:26,319
You have a feeling of tension when you are not getting a good look at something.

845
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:28,159
Let's go back to the picture in the museum.

846
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,599
Unreflexively, you're drawn toward the point of this.

847
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:32,880
I mean, this is so wrong.

848
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,639
This is so decently wrong.

849
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:40,479
The whole point of the book is you're drawn toward the optimal as a case of motor intentionality.

850
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,680
That's what they're doing all the time, is trying to get it done.

851
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:56,319
But what I'm saying is that you only come to know about this passage inner ability only virtue of this little thing.

852
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:08,880
Well, if you're making the logical point that it's a class of things, each of which has, at least each of us has an instance of it, I don't see that that's a problem.

853
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:27,519
Yes, each of us are moving to optimize our grip on the world, and that means that there's some general something called something that falls under the category the sense of optimizing your grip on the world or the sense of tension and equilibrium.

854
01:14:27,519 --> 01:14:44,239
And the point is, every instance of that concept is a private something or other that a particular case of motor intentionality and a particular case of openness on the world, like this one, has.

855
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,880
I don't see any problem with that.

856
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:50,559
Before you say something, he has seven years or so.

857
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:51,119
Can you say something?

858
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:57,920
I mean, the eyes are not ego.

859
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:58,800
Ego.

860
01:14:58,800 --> 01:14:59,439
No.

861
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,880
That's how I told this art story.

862
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,519
There doesn't have to be any eyes who we say.

863
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,719
The more you're going to be encouraging coatings.

864
01:15:08,079 --> 01:15:11,319
I wish you should think about sports and everything about narrow farms.

865
01:15:11,399 --> 01:15:18,279
You think about whatever it is that is most totally absorbed and in whatever you're doing.

866
01:15:18,279 --> 01:15:23,159
Then I'm sorry to switch, and Merlot Farmsy just goes along the same view.

867
01:15:23,159 --> 01:15:28,599
There isn't any I'm counting the cigarettes, or I'm flying on this mountain, or I'm skiing down this mountain.

868
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:32,040
There's just successful skiing is going on.

869
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:36,519
And it would go on even better.

870
01:15:37,479 --> 01:15:43,079
Now you can't say this is true, if I move this way, that your lived body doesn't need that.

871
01:15:43,079 --> 01:15:50,119
Your lived body just senses that it's not going as well as it could be and moves in a way to make it better.

872
01:15:50,119 --> 01:15:54,040
That's what the lived body does.

873
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:55,319
That's his job.

874
01:15:56,439 --> 01:15:57,399
It does that.

875
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:59,880
You believe that the brain is pushed a certain way.

876
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:03,399
That's not our job to talk about that.

877
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:06,439
Now you there's no, there's not going to be an ego.

878
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:07,640
Who's thinking?

879
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:09,239
I'm not who?

880
01:16:09,239 --> 01:16:09,960
What?

881
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:14,920
The lived body of a human being is super.

882
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:20,599
When I'm skiing, it's my body seemingly optimal, but there's no I in the experience.

883
01:16:21,399 --> 01:16:23,239
Okay, let's see how we're doing.

884
01:16:24,359 --> 01:16:26,680
I'll listen to two questions, but I don't have time to answer them.

885
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:27,239
Yeah.

886
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:32,920
I was just going to suggest that there's a connection between the two.

887
01:16:33,239 --> 01:16:46,119
I think Descartes, the two coaches, is the imminent reflective, you know, foundationary thing that we know, which gets us all the rest of our knowledge, which corresponds to the transcendent that's beyond us.

888
01:16:46,119 --> 01:16:54,239
And for Merlin Marty, his kind of transcendence gets the world, gets us into the world, as it were.

889
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:56,639
And his yes, good.

890
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:02,719
But when you say my discovering myself as, you've got to be careful in the test, it shouldn't sound reflective, I think.

891
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:15,199
It should just sound, oh, how about I discover on pure reflection in my memory that I was, or that there was, pure optimizing coping going on.

892
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:16,239
Yes, something like that.

893
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:17,840
Okay, you get the last gun.

894
01:17:18,079 --> 01:17:22,159
Maybe you'll have a open.

895
01:17:22,399 --> 01:17:35,279
How do we count spaces where we get or cooperate and catch each other where it's the our writ on our sleeping?

896
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,719
I like that.

897
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:38,159
You like that.

898
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:38,800
Yes.

899
01:17:39,519 --> 01:17:43,679
I guess the answer, boy, that opens a whole new ballgame.

900
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:49,920
That suggests that the coping, there is something called intercorporeality.

901
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:57,920
We talked about that back in the Being with Others, though the word is never in being in kind, I mean in phenomenology of perception.

902
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:02,800
He uses the term in a late thing, a lake paper, the eye and the mind.

903
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:15,359
But by way of intercorporeality, I don't know whether I pick up directly your attention and your movement away and toward the optimal or not.

904
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:24,319
But it it it doesn't matter, I should say, because the tacit cogito it's it's not a crucial feature of the tacit cogito, perhaps.

905
01:18:24,319 --> 01:18:26,479
I just think is that it'd be private.

906
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:34,719
What what's the crucial feature of the task of Pogito is that it'd be my rock-bottoms experience of myself.

907
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:41,319
And i if somebody else could tune in on it, intercorporeality-wise, I think that's all right.

908
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:43,960
I make too much of a fuss about private, is what you're saying.

909
01:18:44,199 --> 01:18:58,840
It's really what is my basic experience of myself, unreflective, motoring pensionally, hoping that's and the answer is only this, the sense that it's going well or it's not.

910
01:18:59,079 --> 01:19:00,359
That's the best I could.

911
01:19:00,359 --> 01:19:00,759
Okay.
