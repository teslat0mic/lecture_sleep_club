1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Okay, there are problems from last time, all right, content problems.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:22,000
After conferring with and exchanging email with Jennifer and Rick and talking to Alva this morning, I see that I got things sort of off course at the end of the lecture last time when I was talking about attention.

3
00:00:21,999 --> 00:00:26,559
So I always thought it's a good idea to repent at least 10% of your previous lecture.

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,719
So we get an opportunity to do that because I do want to straighten out what I got wrong.

5
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:40,399
Then once I get it straightened, once I straighten out what I've got wrong, I want to talk about what his story about attention is.

6
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:48,239
And then that leads to the issue of realism and idealism, which I've been told by Jennifer I can't hide from.

7
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,440
I have to discuss.

8
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:50,959
So I will discuss it.

9
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:54,879
And that leads finally to a very puzzling passage that I don't understand.

10
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,159
If we make it there, we can all try to figure out what I think it's probably a work.

11
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,080
You'd have to figure out what it means.

12
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:10,239
In any case, I expect to get up to the chat, the phenomenal field plot, which luckily we have assigned for the whole week.

13
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,959
So I will do it next time if I don't get there this time.

14
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,800
All that should be clear.

15
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:28,599
Okay, so let's start with a straightforward quote, which I think I read, but which I now think I misinterpreted somewhat.

16
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:44,599
So, which is on page 31, which that means in the old version in the second full paragraph, within about 10 lines down, on 31, in order to relate it to the life of consciousness, well, it, what's it?

17
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,720
Attention, yes, yes, yep.

18
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:57,559
To the life of consciousness, one would have to show how a perception awakens attention, and then how attention develops and enriches it.

19
00:01:57,559 --> 00:02:05,080
You could use that as an epigraph for the whole attention chapter and what I want to try to talk about today.

20
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,119
It's got two important components.

21
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,800
It's perception which awakens intention.

22
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,200
Intention isn't first.

23
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,040
Intention is a response.

24
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,879
That's something I want to say a lot about, which I didn't say anything about last time.

25
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:26,519
And it's a response which develops and enriches attention.

26
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:29,320
That I said a lot about last time at the end.

27
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,279
And everything I said about it was not exactly wrong.

28
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,879
It was just premature and sort of off the track that he was on.

29
00:02:37,880 --> 00:03:01,360
So the basic idea, before I get into the details, is that normal attention, which he calls secondary attention, because he wants to talk about a more basic kind of attention, but normal attention is drawn to something which attracts us because we're interested in it or because it's just a bright thing or whatever.

30
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:07,440
And it could be because we're looking for something, could be because it just grabs us.

31
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,439
We're drawn to something.

32
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:16,080
And when we do, it becomes, it was in the background, but then it becomes figure.

33
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,920
And what was figure before gets changed into background.

34
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,999
That's just that's good common sense story.

35
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,519
Now and he's going to even elaborate it, and he's not going to take it back.

36
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,160
He's perfectly happy with that kind of everyday attention.

37
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,520
He thinks it's exactly what we normally do.

38
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:44,959
He just thinks that there's an even deeper kind of attention that has the same structure that he wants to call attention to.

39
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:53,600
But before we do, I went off now and said a whole bunch of things which weren't quite right.

40
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:04,720
I said analytic attention in our everyday experience has a positive job of opening up the conceptual world of substances and properties.

41
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,040
Well, that's just wrong in every dimension.

42
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,080
I mean, we're not talking about analytic attention at this point.

43
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:15,999
We're talking about everyday attention that turns backgrounds into figures and figures into backgrounds.

44
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:21,119
Remember, analytic attention is what breaks up gestalts into elements.

45
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:46,800
Analytic attention is what the empiricist sorry without realizing it uses and what the intellectualist makes a big fuss about because that's being awake, being clear-headed, is to have the kind of attention, the analytic kind of attention, that breaks up the gestalt, which is a sort of a confusion from the intellectual point of view, and shows you, remember, the sensory core, the elements.

46
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:56,920
I shouldn't have brought analytic attention in at all, but also we're not talking about how to get to the conceptual world of substances and properties yet.

47
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:08,119
He does need some time to explain how we get an experience of determinate objects, substances with properties, but that's not what he's doing here.

48
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,879
Then I said something about motivation, which is right, but I haven't heard you talk about motivation yet.

49
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:23,639
And I said that the true theory of attention doesn't think of attention as neutral, and that's right.

50
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,920
It doesn't think of attention as having the job of breaking up Gestalt, that's for sure.

51
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:36,439
But then I said, the true role of attention is to focus on the figure in such a way as to give us a determinate, stable world.

52
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,999
That's right, but that's something for later.

53
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:41,480
That's not what this chapter is about.

54
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:55,880
But then I said rightly, and we'll get back to that, very important, that we retroactively cover up the indeterminacy that our attention makes determinate.

55
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:58,439
But I didn't explain quite or at all.

56
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:00,360
Okay, so much for that.

57
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,559
I now scratch that in your notes, and let's try again.

58
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:13,800
So now we're on to something new, or at least sort of new, called, I think, would be called primary and secondary attention.

59
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,519
Those are not technical terms for him.

60
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,519
He just uses the words in passing.

61
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,960
But I told you already about everyday or secondary attention.

62
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,480
Now I'm going to tell you about primary attention.

63
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:45,840
And now this is going to be a critique of both the empiricists and the intellectualists who can't understand attention in the basic way that it functions in giving us a world of objects at all.

64
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:48,800
That's primary attention.

65
00:06:48,800 --> 00:07:11,280
So at the top of 33 in ours, and lost in some huge paragraph in the other, so huge that I better go from the end, about 20 lines above the paragraph that begins against this content, but for all of us, the top of 33, empiricism cannot see what we need to know.

66
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:14,480
Okay, this is a nice way of framing it.

67
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,639
He's going to tell us that I know that he tells it over and over.

68
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,640
Remember, I said he's always arguing with the dialectic.

69
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,319
Empiricism can't see it.

70
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,999
Intellectualism can't see it.

71
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:34,720
There's a third thing that everybody's missed in the whole history of philosophy that Gestalt sort of sees, and he sees finally right, all of which is true, I think.

72
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,559
And so here we go.

73
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:42,640
Empiricism cannot see that we need to know what we're looking for, otherwise we would not be looking for it.

74
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,519
That means empiricism thinks we've just got these clear impressions and that's that.

75
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:58,800
And he's going to set up the idea that there's something leading us to make our experience more and more determinate.

76
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,040
That there's something indeterminate calling on us to make it determinate.

77
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:08,000
He thinks that's the only way you can understand this puzzle that goes back to Labino.

78
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,600
How in the world you could be trying to find something?

79
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,800
Well, only if it's somehow there in some indeterminate way and calling you to make it determinate.

80
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,679
That's in the back of his mind.

81
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:31,800
And then you read again, so but empiricism can't see that because empiricism doesn't see that we need to know what we're looking for, otherwise we'd not be looking for it.

82
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,880
That is, it doesn't see that we're sort of seeking something.

83
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:42,920
And intellectualism fails to see that we need to be ignorant of what we're looking for, or equally again, we shouldn't be searching.

84
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:55,400
So that is, we're seeking something, we don't know clearly and determinately what, but we know that there's, that we've got some sense that there's something there to find and that it'll be called the finder.

85
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,520
They are in agreement that neither can grasp consciousness in the act of learning.

86
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:09,160
That is really now making this indeterminate solicitation, this indeterminate call, determinate.

87
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,000
That would be the kind of learning.

88
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:29,880
They are in agreement that neither can grasp consciousness in the act of learning, and that neither attaches due importance to that circumscribed ignorance, that still empty, but already determined attention, sorry, intention, which is attention itself.

89
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,839
I don't like quite that phrase.

90
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:37,640
I mean, I think that's very bad for him to say: empty, but already determined.

91
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,839
That's just exactly not what he wants to say.

92
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,480
Unfortunately, the French says it.

93
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:49,240
But what he means is the still empty but already somewhat determined.

94
00:09:49,240 --> 00:10:02,560
I mean, it's got to have enough content to be calling you to get it, and enough content so that you can get it right or wrong, but it isn't determinate until you get the right body set to unlock it.

95
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:04,800
I don't know where that is in Merrill-Ponte.

96
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:07,599
I was looking for it, but I think that phrase is very nice.

97
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:16,080
He talks about how we have to get the right body set in order to unlock what is calling us.

98
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,120
And when we do, it becomes determinate as the experience of some object.

99
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,520
But until we do, we want to see how Sprang put that.

100
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,839
Until we do, you don't want to call it or the set determinate.

101
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,960
They get determinate together when you finally unlock the object.

102
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,319
Then you are set to, say it becomes a house.

103
00:10:42,319 --> 00:10:43,600
Well, say it becomes the trees.

104
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:44,480
That's his example.

105
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:48,079
The trees and the ship, that's a kind of problem to unlock.

106
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,120
It's a kind of tension that needs to be resolved.

107
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,960
And then as you walk closer, it falls into place.

108
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:01,359
And on the side of the object, you get a determinate object math contrude.

109
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:11,200
And on the side of me, I get a clear determinate set that I can now go up and feed through museum and chips or get on chips or whatever I'm set to do.

110
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:18,800
So all I would say is not already an empty but already determinate intention.

111
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,359
You've got to say an empty but already determinable intention.

112
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:24,880
Ah, that would be a good way to put it.

113
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,400
I have to go back and look at French again.

114
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,840
Maybe it said that and I missed it.

115
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,120
Wouldn't that be nice?

116
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,360
Because otherwise it's not determined.

117
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,800
Yeah.

118
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:34,640
Empty of what?

119
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:37,679
Well, empty of determinateness.

120
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:40,640
That's just another way of, that's all he means there.

121
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:48,200
It's not got, and my set has not got any specific determinable expectations yet.

122
00:11:48,520 --> 00:12:10,599
And the object, the trees and masks, which aren't trees and masks yet, but just this tension like a storm on the horizon waiting to break, as he puts it, that's empty in the sense that there, you can't say yet, mass and trees, but it's not completely empty because then we'd be back in you to, you wouldn't be looking for something in it.

123
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:23,720
He's got trying to find this middle thing, remember, which has got to be determinate enough to get trying you to be trying to get a grip on it, but not determinate enough for you to get a grip on it.

124
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:31,560
And on your side, you're making it determinate enough to get, you're trying to get a determinate grip on it if you haven't yet.

125
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:34,200
And that's this business of seeking.

126
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:42,280
And you have to have some sense that there's something there to get it to get a grip on, and you have to have some sense if you haven't got a grip on it.

127
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,600
Okay, always about the trees and the mask.

128
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,000
That's what that helped?

129
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,719
Good.

130
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:48,679
Terrific.

131
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:51,000
Everything else okay?

132
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,400
Then let's see where we are.

133
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:57,720
So he's got that story to tell here.

134
00:12:57,719 --> 00:12:59,000
And he's got it almost right.

135
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,160
Oh, I wanted to write on here with my pen.

136
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,360
That's the French again.

137
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:03,400
It seems so long.

138
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,840
Write in the determinables.

139
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,279
I see if I can make it.

140
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,079
Oh, good.

141
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:12,359
Now, there's a whole lot.

142
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:14,520
This is what I was discussing with Alva this morning.

143
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:15,640
You want to come in?

144
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,679
More auditors.

145
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,040
Get up, please.

146
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:23,640
I'll find you and throw you out of the course if you take lessons for people who need to come in.

147
00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:27,480
It's not a good idea for people to be out in the hall.

148
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:29,679
But okay, here we go.

149
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:35,520
So the issue is: so I don't just copy what's out there.

150
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,320
That would be a prejudice of the world.

151
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:42,400
Now, we're talking about when I get the right grip to unlock it.

152
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,800
That's already says I'm not copying what's out there.

153
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,280
And I'm not creating it either.

154
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:56,400
So now the first qualification, I mean, the part of the trouble with this lecture, unfortunately, someone take that seat.

155
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:00,320
Some poor person has given it up for you to be able to sit and take notes.

156
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:06,400
So, and other, if anybody wants to sit and take notes, don't mention it.

157
00:14:06,719 --> 00:14:09,520
Nobody, people taking the course, they're just the exact thing.

158
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:16,000
Auditors are getting up seats for people who can come and take notes on what's going on.

159
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:30,720
So, okay, the next, I mean, before you say anything, not only do I have to try to fix that statement determinant, but I have to try to fix all through what's coming next the use of the word creation.

160
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:39,280
Because I think the basic point is you're not creating, at least you're not creating ex nilo anything.

161
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:44,240
You're, and he has another word, which is much the right word, articulating.

162
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,959
That is, you are making determinate.

163
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,800
You are bringing into focus.

164
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,480
When you bring something into focus and make it determinate, you don't create it.

165
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:55,679
That is just not a sensible way of talking.

166
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:11,679
But he's very sloppily using articulating, creating, and another word constituting, as if somehow we knew what they meant, or he knew what they meant, or they meant the same thing sometimes, and sometimes they don't mean the same thing.

167
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:16,400
It's always like, why didn't he write another draft and give it to some people to correct?

168
00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:18,040
But anyway, I'll correct it.

169
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,240
He should have given it to me.

170
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:19,400
Yeah.

171
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,640
Yes, yes.

172
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,959
Well, that's what I want to call articulating.

173
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:35,559
The only reason I don't want to call it creating is it sounds like like a blank canvas.

174
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,200
There's nothing there, and then you put something on it.

175
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:51,480
And the whole point is there's something there, this problem, this solicitation, this thing like a storm on the horizon, this indeterminate tension that's trying you're trying to get a grip on and unlock.

176
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:55,240
So it's like when you unlock something, do you create anything?

177
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:01,640
No, you manage to bring out something that's there, I think.

178
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,479
I mean, Alvin and I discussed it, and I'm really bouncing off that discussion.

179
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,040
Yeah.

180
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:13,400
But mine is not um a little bit more of the use of the term constitution because I'm gonna get to it.

181
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:16,280
Yeah, yeah, okay, but it comes around pretty soon.

182
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,439
Okay, well, but I can say something right now.

183
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:29,000
The constitution could mean what it means in Husserl, in which case it's pretty much creation ex voice, because in Husserl he has the form and matter picture.

184
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:39,559
There's pure fule, which is the Greek for matter, and then there's conceptual form, which consciousness imposes on it, and then pure intellectual position.

185
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:42,440
He considers it a certain point in here without naming it.

186
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,040
But it's not like that.

187
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,760
The the healer doesn't have enough solicitation.

188
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,679
There's food in the kind.

189
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:54,359
Uh and uh so and that kind of constitution is not the kind he wants.

190
00:16:54,359 --> 00:17:01,159
And since Husserl is sort of the one who put the word constitution into the ballgame, I think he shouldn't use it.

191
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:09,999
He and when he does talk about constitution, he usually talks about this kind of this intellectualist kind of understanding of constitution.

192
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,119
Yeah, it would be very much like Kusserals.

193
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,760
In Kant, I don't know, does Kant use the word constitution?

194
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,639
Anybody know?

195
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:27,679
Now that I think of it, I'm not sure he does, because the forms of sensibility, space and time, don't constitute anything.

196
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,079
They just form it.

197
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:32,639
And then we put the categories on it.

198
00:17:32,639 --> 00:17:41,200
If anything is constitution in Kant, it's putting the categories on the manifold of sensibility, which has already got a sort of structure.

199
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,800
I think we shouldn't go into Kant.

200
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:47,679
But if anybody knows whether he uses the word Constitution, come and tell me or send me an email.

201
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,360
I haven't got time to reread the critique of your reason to find out.

202
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,559
My colleagues who know are all often Germans right now.

203
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,919
Okay.

204
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:56,640
Yeah.

205
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,040
Is that attention and empty?

206
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,120
Yeah, what he says, yeah.

207
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:01,839
I don't like it.

208
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:07,040
That's why you read it back to by intention or given.

209
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:07,679
Ah, you know.

210
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,959
No, he means directedness, exactly.

211
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,880
And it isn't even a propositional representational kind of directedness.

212
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:22,879
It's just directed for lowering the confusion, resolving the tension.

213
00:18:22,879 --> 00:18:27,760
He doesn't know what it's directed for in the sense it has no goal, unless that's a goal.

214
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,679
That's a very peculiar kind of goal.

215
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:35,599
It doesn't have a representation of what would count as something specific that would count as success.

216
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:45,359
It has a kind of is built into it that success will be resolving the tension and getting something determinate.

217
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:55,399
And in that sense, it's intentional, because it has, I was talking with John Surrey for an hour yesterday, so I started falling into Thurley and talk, which is fine for here.

218
00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:59,079
That's why it's intentional, because it can succeed or fail.

219
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:02,840
You could just throw yourself into the confusion and never get out again.

220
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:05,639
It would never take shape.

221
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,359
So, okay.

222
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:13,159
So there is a kind of intentionality involved.

223
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:20,199
And, but it's not representational, propositional, intentionality.

224
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:22,120
Okay, so watch for that.

225
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:22,999
You see, is that okay?

226
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,839
You're still worried.

227
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:26,040
Okay.

228
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:32,760
There is the empty but already determinable tendency.

229
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,559
How's that?

230
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,679
Directedness.

231
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,800
Why not directed?

232
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:37,159
So there is the empty.

233
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,319
Let's do, what do we do with empty?

234
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:40,120
The blank?

235
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:41,160
Does that help any?

236
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:43,639
The well, no, it doesn't help any.

237
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:46,679
It has to be there.

238
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,680
The indeterminate, but already determinable.

239
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,520
Yeah, let's rewrite it all together.

240
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,079
Because I think he's right to sort of obsess about what that sentence means.

241
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:59,479
So the empty there means indeterminate.

242
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:05,719
There's no particular properties it has, but already determinable directedness.

243
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,879
If we tried to rewrite every sentence like this, we'd never get past the getting to the book.

244
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:13,480
But it helps to rewrite one now and then, a pretty important one.

245
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:13,880
Yeah.

246
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,000
But you can hear a whole bunch of things.

247
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:23,319
Do you understand these sections as the as leading to the votes, the idea of of motive?

248
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:25,639
And that's right.

249
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:27,879
Do I didn't see the sense of opposite?

250
00:20:27,879 --> 00:20:28,280
No.

251
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:30,199
Well, there is a sense.

252
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:46,559
Well, you talk about, um with the keep using uh it strikes me with this possibility does lend itself to to a more opposite word intention of perhaps like want.

253
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:48,079
Well, where?

254
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:55,520
The anti the the determinable neediness or something desire desire or intention.

255
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:55,920
Yeah.

256
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:58,159
Those are all intentional notions, of course.

257
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:58,800
You're right.

258
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,440
You're right.

259
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,480
I mean when you look when we get done with it, we would we could rewrite it again.

260
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,479
It's the indeterminate but determinable I can only say neediness.

261
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:18,319
We don't have a word like desiriness, but but that's the thing you're getting at, that there's some there's something that uh we haven't got that we want.

262
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,680
Or attraction.

263
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,480
Attraction.

264
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,919
Maybe let's try that.

265
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,960
Uh indeterminate, the determinable maybe.

266
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,399
I mean, I I hear from attraction too much as if there was something determinate there doing the attracting.

267
00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:40,079
And if I want to put it on our side, there is something that that we sense that because it's all in every context you're looking at something.

268
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:47,520
I guess attraction in the language we're attracted to the back side on the streets that we're going to be talking to attraction to it.

269
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,159
Yeah.

270
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,319
I think you build in things there that are are nice but but additional to the central point.

271
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:03,440
So I'll I'm going to stick to something something like neediness is all I can think of if you have to put it in there.

272
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,159
There's it there because we do have this, it's like a question that needs to be solved.

273
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,319
That's what it's in the context of that.

274
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:12,159
But it was something we're looking for.

275
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,280
How about seeking?

276
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,000
Well, the indeterminate, the determinable feeding.

277
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,880
Will that do?

278
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:18,919
That's good.

279
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:23,959
That's the kind of directedness it is, because you could have a directedness, but you just stare at something and don't seek it.

280
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,680
But how can it be intentional in John Surah's sense if it's indeterminate?

281
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,239
It can't.

282
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,520
That's why I was sort of trying to say it was not representational and propositional.

283
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,520
I am vector-surrowed sense.

284
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:50,280
But John was telling me yesterday that any feral-ponty-like point can always be put in terms of success conditions in a very broad sense because then you're asking, well, what is it?

285
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,919
Well, it's seeking determination.

286
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:58,600
But that isn't the normal kind of propositional representation because of its indeterminacy.

287
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:09,319
Whereas in John, you find more the paradigm kind of intentionality is you're trying to achieve some goal and you know what the goal is, you just haven't got it yet.

288
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:17,159
Here, you don't even know what the goal is, except in this very different way, that it's the goal is to get it clear enough so that you can deal with it.

289
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:18,919
The goal is to figure out what's there.

290
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:19,879
So there's this shift.

291
00:23:19,879 --> 00:23:28,280
You don't know what's there, but you're trying to is the actual change in consciousness that leads you to figure out.

292
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:35,399
Well, it's it's not the change, it's what leads you to change to have this change of consciousness and get a figure.

293
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:49,399
I think we disagree, but instead of so could you raise it as having the condition of factor of trying to figure out what that there is an X implicit again in all these statements.

294
00:23:49,639 --> 00:23:50,359
Right, exactly.

295
00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:54,760
So I guess why it has an indeterminate trajectory, just removing outwards.

296
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,159
You can get past the Searle.

297
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,760
Something about other than itself.

298
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,760
So you don't have to get a there as an X.

299
00:24:00,879 --> 00:24:03,040
Yeah, but you do have to get a kind of seeking in.

300
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,199
It's put in the terms of searching.

301
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:07,120
And then it's all right.

302
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:19,520
I mean, I don't mind if it's like Searle, as long as it's not a determinate kind of representation of a goal that you already know, where the emphasis is on the activity of achieving it.

303
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,439
Here there is no goal yet.

304
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,960
And the activity is the emphasis is on finding out what's there.

305
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,079
Well, I would consider that to be the goal.

306
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:29,760
Well, yeah, but it's a different sort of goal.

307
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,079
That's all.

308
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,400
Yeah, or some different level, anyway.

309
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,679
And that's right.

310
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:43,679
So it's a kind of intentionality, and it has conditions of success and failure.

311
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:49,679
I like to call it conditions of improvement because you can get more and more determinate.

312
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:58,159
Whereas generally, the way Searle thinks of it, you either get what you get satisfaction when you achieve the goal.

313
00:24:58,639 --> 00:25:04,000
Here, what you do is you're goal to get a better and better grip on it.

314
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,079
But that's still, you could succeed or fail.

315
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:10,000
So we're not making any, we're not, I'm not, I'm not disagreeing.

316
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:12,319
If I were disagreeing, let me think of this.

317
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:14,800
I think this is too complicated to explain.

318
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:17,599
I'll try to tell you how I would disagree with Sherlock.

319
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,280
I could do it.

320
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:29,280
All I can say is this sort of unhelpful and uninteresting thing that the doctrine functions in a different way, in the way Merlot does.

321
00:25:29,439 --> 00:25:33,520
Someday I may be able to say this when we've got more stuff on the table and I thought about it.

322
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:33,839
Yeah.

323
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:45,159
It's not an idea of a relation that's so intense with B and D, and I had an illusion.

324
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:46,040
Somebody said that.

325
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:49,239
Now I keep thinking that doesn't you say that last time to me the right way to think about it.

326
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,599
I don't want to think about it that way.

327
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:52,200
No intentionality with an S.

328
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,520
In fact, no more intentionality with a T.

329
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,000
Let me get back to this.

330
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:12,280
I mean, if you, by the way, want it clear with your CA thinking about this and Searle, I think it's a very illuminating enterprise if you have to convince your TA that you already knew Searle and that your job was thinking about this.

331
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:16,199
And you'd have to take sort of the Searle views for granted while explaining these.

332
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:16,760
Yeah.

333
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:22,280
No, there is because, like, he's calling attention a different kind of intention.

334
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,239
And we're going to talk about the intentionality like T, right?

335
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,159
And but somehow the intention that is attention is both determinate and indeterminate.

336
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:32,280
So naturally you wonder, well, how is it determined and how is it indeterminate?

337
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:36,520
Well, what's minimally necessary for an intention of the C to be determined is the direction.

338
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,119
That's what intentionality is.

339
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:41,480
What's indeterminate about the intention is what is the direction of.

340
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,479
So it sounds like he's calling me intentionally kind of directed without an end.

341
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,040
And that's a little bit like the intentional report.

342
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:52,919
The intentional report cuts out a hole that he built in.

343
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:58,040
So in a way, I'm not drawing a clue between an analogy.

344
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:10,040
Well, okay, but don't say more just because what's important to Meryl Fonte and me right now is the sense that there is this seeking to fill it in and that it's drawing you to fill it in.

345
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,199
It's already somehow it's already there pulling you.

346
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,359
That's like the storm on the horizon story.

347
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,479
I don't know whether that's with an S I got.

348
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,720
It's more than a hole.

349
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,719
It's sui generous.

350
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,920
It's unlikely that it's going to look like anything in Searle.

351
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:32,959
I mean, I don't want to talk about it more except in office hours because we're talking at a level of the jargon that it's not going to be helpful because lots and lots of people.

352
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,480
Okay, now I'm ready to go back to this.

353
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,239
I'm never going to get done.

354
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,520
Okay, so it's misleading to bring in creation, I think.

355
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,439
It's not the way we should talk.

356
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:51,359
He says on the number 34, and Rink alerted me to this, to my horror, that there is literally a question of creation.

357
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,199
I don't think there's a, there's certainly not a question of literal creation.

358
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,639
We'd have to go back and see if we could save that one from the branch, too.

359
00:27:58,639 --> 00:28:05,200
I mean, but I don't think there's any question of creation at all, however, you throw the litter leaves or the creation.

360
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,119
So I just toss that one out.

361
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:08,880
What about the object of creation?

362
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,800
There is no object of creation.

363
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,040
That's why there's this very thing.

364
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:19,119
I happen to know how we talk about the first operation of his answer then to create for itself a field.

365
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:21,840
But that's kind of different from creating an object.

366
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:23,919
I mean, God, we maybe create an object.

367
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,280
Yeah, I agree with you.

368
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,520
And maybe creation is like the organizational aspect of things or anything about life and that's what it is.

369
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:43,040
Well, I don't know what it means, but it comes in every once in a while, not just in this context of this particular sort of brain-injured person that he's talking about, as I recall.

370
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,440
Yeah, but let's, I mean, never mind how it happens.

371
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:53,119
I mean, every time you see it, I think it can be cashed out as articulation, and so why not?

372
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:53,839
Let's do it.

373
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:55,439
Okay, we'll do it.

374
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:02,159
So my body response to the context is foreign.

375
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:03,679
Well, not here yet, is it?

376
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:05,599
That's the next time it's talking about it.

377
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:06,479
At the bottom of the page.

378
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,559
There's a continuation of that phone.

379
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,159
No, there's this person who can't find located on their body.

380
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,520
So he says there's literally a question of creation.

381
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:16,760
For example, maybe.

382
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:18,119
Okay, now he's doing this.

383
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:18,599
Okay.

384
00:29:16,639 --> 00:29:20,040
Okay, now he's to the child.

385
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:28,440
And the child and he says about the colors for the child's world that they were indeterminate, which is interesting.

386
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,159
I mean, he doesn't say the child's world has no color.

387
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:32,920
He's trying to do his thing again.

388
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:36,760
That indeterminate on our thing is five lines from the bottom.

389
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:40,119
A world in which colors were indeterminate.

390
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:46,280
That is, again, a child's world has a kind of pull to color, but it can't get color yet.

391
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:54,920
Eventually it gets pulled into sort of distinguishing red, warm and cold, and then it gets maybe zero or four colors.

392
00:29:54,919 --> 00:30:02,439
And finally, this indeterminacy gets completely made determinate, and the child gets the colors.

393
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,280
But it didn't create the colors.

394
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,639
It didn't even create, you know, or the possibility of color even.

395
00:30:07,879 --> 00:30:09,639
That's all given.

396
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:14,359
What he needs, what the child needs, in my jargon, and which is Maryland Ponte's, but I can't find it.

397
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:16,040
It just unlocks the color.

398
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:21,000
It's the color for the child is like the rabbit in the woods and one of those puzzles.

399
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,599
I mean, something's in there.

400
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:25,399
Something's trying to get out and become clear.

401
00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:26,359
I don't know yet.

402
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:29,319
And then one day, aha, I see the rabbit in the trees.

403
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,839
Jennifer and then Rick.

404
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:30,919
Yeah.

405
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:35,879
With the rabbit in the trees.

406
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,639
But that's not intent.

407
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,439
It's like a sort of anxiety that's undirected, but there is some sort of resolution.

408
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:46,839
You can see that it's not a good idea.

409
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:50,679
There's always, and I'll give you lots of quotes as I get along.

410
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,119
Everybody's jumping ahead, but that's all I there's the set that's that this has got to do with motivation.

411
00:30:56,119 --> 00:31:08,559
There's always motivation, and motivation is always a pull to get something that you haven't got, but which which which you already sense is there and which you need, and that's it.

412
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,319
And that's why I talk that way.

413
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:10,800
Rip.

414
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:16,239
So in this question of creation, so he says that the colors were indeterminate.

415
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:22,000
And what's kind of contradictory about that is that the colors were for the for the developmental child.

416
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,079
They're already there and created, so to speak, in this indeterminate way.

417
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:28,720
And then there is this other act of creation that gets it been making it.

418
00:31:28,879 --> 00:31:31,120
Well, he's gotta he's gotta be careful.

419
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,319
He shouldn't say that the colors were there indeterminate.

420
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:38,559
What he should say is something's there indeterminate.

421
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:39,200
I know he does.

422
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:45,359
But what he's thinking is something is there, something there is indeterminate, which when it gets to be determinate will be colors.

423
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,680
That would be the right thing to say.

424
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,999
Well, we have to write this over bit by bit.

425
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,639
Could somebody close the door and there's a kind of cold wind across here, which normally I would like, but somehow right now I don't.

426
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,599
If it gets too hot, we can close it again.

427
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:05,680
And just to hit, the reason why we care about this is that, you know, the real question is, is he an idealist?

428
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,800
Well, yeah, we're getting there.

429
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,359
I hope we get there by the end today, of course.

430
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:11,119
And the answer is complicated.

431
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:11,520
Maybe.

432
00:32:12,879 --> 00:32:14,879
Lots of distinctions, which we'll get to.

433
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:15,839
Let's see.

434
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,839
So I don't want to bring in creation.

435
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:23,680
My body responds to the solicitations in the ground and brings out a new figure from out of the ground.

436
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,040
That's how he says it.

437
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,399
And right after where we are, the colors.

438
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:29,359
Next paragraph.

439
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:35,119
Now attention, this is ha has to be conceived on the model of these primary acts.

440
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,559
The secondary attention, that's everyday attention.

441
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:46,000
Which would be limited to recalling knowledge already gained, would once more identify it with acquisition.

442
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:58,919
See, all he's saying is that you have to do this primary thing of getting the object determined in the first place before you can then switch back and forth between the object and the field, and sometimes you pay attention to the object and sometimes you don't.

443
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:00,599
That's secondary attention.

444
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:10,360
He wants to go he wants to use the same structure, remember I said, that he wants to go to something that has, makes that ordinary attention possible.

445
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:15,559
And now, to pay attention is not merely further to elucidate a pre-existing data.

446
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:17,239
That's what we normally do.

447
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:25,000
We pay attention to the red lectern, then we're just paying attention to some 350 thing, which was in the background and now is in the figure.

448
00:33:24,999 --> 00:33:25,719
We do that.

449
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,319
But that's all he's interested in here.

450
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:31,640
It's to bring about a new articulation by taking them as figures.

451
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:35,160
Think of the mast in the ship and the trees.

452
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,720
They are pre-formed only as horizons.

453
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,479
They constitute in reality new regions in the total world.

454
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:46,600
That is, the colors are one example for that.

455
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:52,519
I wonder if the trees and the boats, I should say, is really secondary attention.

456
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:54,280
I mean, because you already know what trees are.

457
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,879
You already know what boats are.

458
00:33:55,879 --> 00:33:57,319
That's secondary attention.

459
00:33:57,319 --> 00:34:05,080
What he's interested in is learning about some new something or other for the first time.

460
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,160
That's primary attention.

461
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,359
And notice they have the same sort of structure.

462
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:16,760
The difference is you already know what trees are and masts are, and you're trying to get that to sort itself out.

463
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:27,159
It's not like the child already knowing what colors are and in a situation in which something is blurry and then it's so dark and then finally they manage to see the color.

464
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,719
It's not, they don't know what colors are yet.

465
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,560
And that's the primary story.

466
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,679
So let's see.

467
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:44,960
But the important commonality, the structure, is that you articulate something into a figure which was on the horizon before.

468
00:34:45,999 --> 00:34:52,480
And that means on the horizon in the sense that in the background, that's synonymous.

469
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:59,120
And in the background means there was already a sense that something was needing to be made determinate.

470
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,920
There was already you were seeking to get a better grip.

471
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:05,839
There was a sense that there was something there that you could get a better grip on.

472
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,640
That's all in it.

473
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,079
I think, okay, yeah.

474
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,800
So my body responds and so forth.

475
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:18,079
And I said in my notes, the ships, but now I think that remember where the chips are.

476
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,119
They're on page 20.

477
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:19,999
I'm not going to go back.

478
00:35:19,999 --> 00:35:23,280
Well, I keep using the language of page 20, so let's look at it.

479
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,240
Because though it's secondary, it's the same structure.

480
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,759
So let me go there.

481
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,879
If I walk along the shore way back, I just want to stick to the middle of the page.

482
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:35,999
The unity of the object is based on the foreshadowing.

483
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:39,280
This is what's the similar thing of a similar structure.

484
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:51,440
The foreshadowing of an imminent order, which is about to spring upon us, a reply to questions in their relation to the landscape, it solves the problem set only in the form of a vague feeling of uneasiness.

485
00:35:53,839 --> 00:36:02,080
That's the general way of talking about attention, which is the same whether it's secondary or primary.

486
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,600
It's like the thing I began with on page 31.

487
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,999
Perception awakens the tens attention and develops and enriches it.

488
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,239
And attention is about how that happens.

489
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:22,999
Now so but now we're looking at the primary kind, which is the kind that is something like creation, but better called articulation.

490
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,519
I just said it misleading to call it atten creation.

491
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,280
It should be called articulation.

492
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,039
See the bottom of page.

493
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,559
See page 45.

494
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,079
Notice I just ran over it too fast.

495
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,280
But pay attention is not merely to elucidate pre-existing data.

496
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,600
It's to bring about a new articulation.

497
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:43,720
I didn't make up that word because of the word he really needs.

498
00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:51,560
The articulate means to focus, to make clearer, to see the joints of, to see how it all hangs together.

499
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,039
That's what he's talking about.

500
00:36:56,039 --> 00:37:00,359
And he also says constitution lower down.

501
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:02,439
And that's where I and that's that's Husserl's word.

502
00:37:02,439 --> 00:37:03,639
But let's skip a little.

503
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:13,080
The miracle of consciousness consists in its bringing to light through attention phenomena which re-establish the unity of the object in a new dimension at the very moment they destroy it.

504
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,999
That's okay.

505
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:20,200
I mean, I think that's not always the way it is, and I don't think we should stop to think of examples.

506
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:29,960
Thus, attention is neither an association of images nor the return of itself to thought already in control of its objects, but the active constitution of a new object.

507
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:34,280
Well, if constitution means the same as articulation, yes.

508
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:39,720
But if it means, like in Husserl, imposing a form on an unstructured matter, no.

509
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,959
And which makes it explicit and articulate, that's good.

510
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:51,800
Making explicit, you know, is another version of articulation, except if making explicit is also not a good idea.

511
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,199
But we've been crossed that word out while we're editable.

512
00:37:54,200 --> 00:38:01,400
The reason it's not a good idea is when you talk about explicit, you usually think of it as already implicit.

513
00:38:01,399 --> 00:38:09,439
Now, there is a sense of implicit where it's in the indeterminate, but there's only one right way of making it determinate.

514
00:38:09,439 --> 00:38:13,519
And in that sort of way, the determinant's already implicit.

515
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:21,120
But it's a misleading because usually implicit, I mean, you can see it's just there already, and you can bring it out.

516
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:27,040
It's, I mean, if I say such, you know, I don't know, do I need an example of normal implicit?

517
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:47,839
There's a big fat book by Robert Brandon called Making It Explicit, and it goes on and on and on about how all the structures of what Merlot even call intellectualist stuff is in there all along, and we can bring it out, and it's a good job of philosophy to bring it out.

518
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:48,959
It's really image.

519
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:57,279
I know how to, I know, that was just blabbing, but here's the right thing to say: the sensory core people believe that the sensory core is implicit.

520
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:04,319
And when you break up the perceptual field, you make explicit what was in there all along, namely the elements, which were implicit.

521
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:06,080
That's bad.

522
00:39:06,399 --> 00:39:10,319
That's one connotation of implicit, and we don't want it.

523
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:13,200
Because it isn't as if the elements are in there all along.

524
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:19,040
It's just indeterminate solicitation or tendency or what is his word.

525
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:19,519
What was it?

526
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:21,680
It was nice about the mess.

527
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,560
Yeah, the vague uneasiness, right.

528
00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:27,680
Foreshadowing.

529
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,560
Yeah.

530
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,440
Good.

531
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:37,800
So now, so now I'm going to get rid of the, we're going to get rid of the implicit as soon as I find my own people.

532
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,800
Oh, Merlot Kind of put on lucky.

533
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,800
He's gone and we can't edit his book.

534
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:46,160
Where's the implicit?

535
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,079
Oh, yeah, here it is.

536
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,800
Okay, five lines from the bottom of 35.

537
00:39:50,120 --> 00:40:00,200
But the active constitution of the new object, which makes explicit, no, which makes articulate, what was until then presented is no more than an indeterminate horizon.

538
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,160
Indeterminate horizon equal ground.

539
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,120
That's just that he can use them interchangeably.

540
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,359
So articulation isn't copying, it isn't creating.

541
00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:14,919
Now we get to the next important move, which has sort of been guiding my discussion.

542
00:40:14,919 --> 00:40:18,200
He really wants to introduce the idea of motivation.

543
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,520
And a motivation isn't a cause, and it isn't a reason.

544
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:26,359
Causes and reasons come from the world of determinateness.

545
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:40,839
That is, sensations can cause input from the world can cause sensations, and reasons can cause me to act in a certain way.

546
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:44,040
They are all, they are determinate.

547
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:53,319
But what he's talking about, which is, again, these vague uneasiness, the vague solicitation, that's what he wants to call motivation.

548
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:55,480
That's not determining.

549
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,399
Let's see where that is.

550
00:40:57,399 --> 00:41:01,080
At the bottom of page, I'm right where I was.

551
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:09,559
At the same time as it sets attention in motion, the object is at every moment recaptured and placed once more in a state of dependence on it.

552
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:20,040
It gives rise to the knowledge-freeing event, which is to transform it, which by means of the still ambiguous meaning, which is required that event to clarify.

553
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:25,399
By the way, I think if you say transform, you don't mean the same as create.

554
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:30,439
I mean, that's another way to say creation is a bad word if what you're talking about is transformation.

555
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,200
Articulation is a transformation.

556
00:41:31,399 --> 00:41:37,199
It is, therefore, the motive and not the cause of the event.

557
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:42,560
Okay, there he slips in the word motive, and now we have to figure out what that is.

558
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:55,200
Well, it's a crucial notion in Merillo's Hungary because we are constantly taking what is indeterminate in our experience and making it determinate.

559
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:02,480
And we're doing that because we are called to do it, that's solicited talk and so forth.

560
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:15,359
And motive is my response to this kind of indeterminacy calling me to get a body set that will make it determinate.

561
00:42:15,919 --> 00:42:20,960
A motive is this pull to being, to unlocking it.

562
00:42:20,959 --> 00:42:23,439
And he used it in all sorts of ways.

563
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:57,120
I mean, from where the binocular vision motivates a sense of distance, because if I saw, if there was something wrong so that I saw two images in the scene, which were not quite superimposed, I would try to put it together for his way of thinking, it's the body schema outside of consciousness, which, because these two images don't quite fit, is pulled to get these images together and to produce an experience of distance.

564
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,400
That's the way he's going to use the term motive.

565
00:43:00,399 --> 00:43:07,920
Motive, it takes the place for him, of all kinds of intellectualist unconscious thinking, processing.

566
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:12,359
These two images are this far apart, the object would have to be that far away.

567
00:43:12,999 --> 00:43:19,720
For my two eyes, the image was that far apart, and therefore I now see the object as a certain distance.

568
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,800
That's the view he doesn't want.

569
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:34,920
He just wants to say the visual field is unstable, and then the object finds a certain distance and sits there, and that is the motive has done it.

570
00:43:36,439 --> 00:43:59,879
It's a way of saying that what he calls the body schema, I'll come to that in a minute, has in it already ways to respond to sort of unbalances, I guess, in the perceptual field and get a stable order.

571
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:17,640
Another way he puts it at some point about distance is that there's this sort of unstableness about some tree, and then the tree retreats into a certain part of the landscape, which is a certain, which is experienced as a certain distance from me, and settles down.

572
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:26,520
That's because there was a kind of motivation to get that tree there would be stable, and the visual system does it.

573
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:33,319
And it does it without consciously or unconsciously having a theory about it or doing any calculations.

574
00:44:33,319 --> 00:44:36,600
It has its own kind of logic, he says.

575
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,679
Okay, I'm going to read you things like that now.

576
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,280
I just jumped ahead.

577
00:44:40,919 --> 00:44:43,800
So, where am I just a second?

578
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:45,959
Done by the body schema.

579
00:44:45,959 --> 00:44:47,720
Have I got ready for that?

580
00:44:48,439 --> 00:44:48,999
Yeah.

581
00:44:49,999 --> 00:44:56,559
On uh on 55 in in the body schema is introduced in the middle of a long, long, long, long paragraph.

582
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,959
Endless paragraph.

583
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:09,039
Uh the only clue I can give you other guys is if they if you see a footnote, structure of comport, structure de comport dement 178, then you're in the vicinity.

584
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:20,720
But then he just says in passing, it's got to do with the body schema, and I'm not going to But he's talking about a motive there in italics earlier.

585
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:25,999
But I remember when I set this out that maybe I can read it to you now.

586
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,120
Let's see.

587
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,240
What's he talking about?

588
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,879
We had attention and judgment.

589
00:45:30,879 --> 00:45:31,919
Weren't we looking along?

590
00:45:32,879 --> 00:45:33,359
Same chapter.

591
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:34,479
Three or four pages.

592
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,680
He's talking, in fact, about how you see distance here, isn't he?

593
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:40,559
I'm not sure.

594
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:45,280
But when the movements of the body...

595
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,999
He's talking about that example turtling on where your eye was.

596
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:50,800
Oh, yeah, right.

597
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,800
That's why I didn't want to talk about it.

598
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,600
Because it's such a weird case.

599
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:00,079
But he introduces the notion of motive in italics, and he mentions the body schema.

600
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,280
I want to talk about it really.

601
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:04,879
It's not such an abnormal case, so I'm going to go on.

602
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:15,040
So articulation is a body, it requires a body response, and he spells it out on 56.

603
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,280
So that's three, from the middle of 56, another huge area.

604
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,319
The same pair.

605
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,359
Paragraph, but see about it.

606
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:26,720
You could have a lot of them.

607
00:46:26,879 --> 00:46:27,999
Anyway, I don't know.

608
00:46:27,999 --> 00:46:35,120
So the objects filling up the field do not act on the apparent distance in the relation of cause to effect.

609
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:38,119
Ah, yeah, this is the point I was making this point.

610
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,879
But I said distance has to do with motivation for him.

611
00:46:40,879 --> 00:46:44,720
When the screen is removed, you see remoteness born of the intervening objects.

612
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,440
This is the silent language whereby perception communicates with us.

613
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:52,440
Interposed objects in the natural context mean a greater distance.

614
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:53,479
Mean in quotes.

615
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,800
I mean, it doesn't got to do with meaning.

616
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:02,680
It's got to do with the fact that they're going to only become stable when you get the put far enough away.

617
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:08,999
It's not, however, a question of connection recognized by objective logic, because that's the intellectualist.

618
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:12,200
He thinks it's unconscious, normal logic.

619
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,640
The logic of constituted truth, that's not it.

620
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:24,200
For there is no reason why a steeple should appear to me to be smaller and further away when I am better able to see and detail the slopes and fields between me and it.

621
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:34,040
He's giving sort of gestaltist answer to an intellectualist account of how we come to see a tree a certain distance.

622
00:47:34,039 --> 00:47:36,359
There is no reason, but there is a motive.

623
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:53,560
It's precisely Gestalt's psychology which has brought home to us the tensions, see, I didn't make this up, that run like lines of force across the visual field and the system, own-bodied world, and which breathe into it a secret magic life.

624
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,280
They're a weird thought of Merlot-Ponty.

625
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:12,120
But the secret magic life is just the way your perceptual system will sort things out in certain distances, will sort things out to have just like trees and masts and all of this in a secret because it's in your body and you're not conscious of it.

626
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:24,760
Magic because it isn't doing logical calculations and it isn't doing memories of previous impressions that are somehow associated with trees looking like that.

627
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,920
It's doing some third thing.

628
00:48:26,919 --> 00:48:32,480
It's the visual system doing what Merlot-Ponty thinks visual systems do.

629
00:48:33,439 --> 00:48:34,319
Okay.

630
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,079
And then he says, I'm not sure I'm ready for it, though.

631
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:38,479
Let me just see.

632
00:48:38,879 --> 00:48:40,319
I'm trying to put this in my order.

633
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:41,839
I'm going to read my own stuff for a minute.

634
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:49,200
Attention is my openness to solicitations in the background, which my body responds to by articulating a new figure out of the background.

635
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,519
My response is receptive to the solicitation.

636
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:52,800
It's already there.

637
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,079
That's not news.

638
00:48:54,479 --> 00:49:03,920
Okay, I'm ready for 56, where he goes on to criticize the Gestaltists, having just taken over their notion of motivation, skipping down a bit.

639
00:49:03,919 --> 00:49:15,680
But when Gestalt psychology, well, sorry, what Gestalt psychology lacks for the adequate expression of these perceptual relationships is a set of new categories.

640
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:20,240
Now that's interesting and a strange thing to say.

641
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:24,400
But I think this is going to be, this is the transition to idealism.

642
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:28,319
But I want to be aware any other.

643
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:29,920
Yeah.

644
00:49:29,919 --> 00:49:30,319
Okay.

645
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:31,359
Now, what did they do?

646
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:34,880
They lack a new category.

647
00:49:34,879 --> 00:49:36,160
Think of this.

648
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:47,440
How many interesting Gestalt categories has Merlot-Ponty used, which are uniquely Gestalt, not intellectualist, not empiricist?

649
00:49:47,439 --> 00:49:49,599
And he's asking for new categories.

650
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,639
I'm going to list them.

651
00:49:50,640 --> 00:50:02,639
He's talked about equilibrium, tension, good form, maximum coherence, feel, norm, motive.

652
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,319
Even motive is one of theirs.

653
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:07,280
Indeterminacy and solicitations.

654
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,439
How many more categories would you want?

655
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,600
Those are all new categories.

656
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,200
And he's taken them over.

657
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:13,999
Did you really?

658
00:50:13,999 --> 00:50:18,679
I thought this was just plain craziness, that I now think it's not craziness.

659
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:25,319
What he really means is they aren't going to talk about this in the proper idealist language.

660
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,680
A weird way to say that.

661
00:50:29,319 --> 00:50:35,960
The new category that they lack is going to be for next time, the phenomenal field, the next chapter.

662
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:47,960
They've got fields, all right, and they've got phenomena, all right, but there's a certain way of hearing phenomenal fields in a crazy, idealistic way that they haven't got.

663
00:50:47,959 --> 00:51:06,999
Because he thinks there's something wrong with the Gestalt people because they're naturalists, because they believe that there's a physical world, and that the brain is functioning according to the laws of physics, and that they ought to be able to find fields in our brain to correspond to the fields in perception.

664
00:51:07,479 --> 00:51:10,040
He thinks that's just wrong.

665
00:51:10,039 --> 00:51:11,800
I think that's absolutely right.

666
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:15,720
I'm all for the Gestaltists, but that's, we don't have to take sides here.

667
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:22,119
The important thing is, for him anyway, and this I think is utterly unfair.

668
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:36,839
He says on the next page, about 237, Gestalt psychology, which, like all psychology, is imprisoned within the self-evident truths of science and the world, they do believe in science and the world, can choose only between reason and cause.

669
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:38,119
Well, that's not fair.

670
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:42,760
The Gestaltists are the one that introduced the notion of motion, which he just took over from them.

671
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:46,680
What he means by that, it isn't just a slip-up, it's worse.

672
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:54,359
What he means is they're looking for the physical causes behind the motivations.

673
00:51:54,359 --> 00:52:01,440
They want to find out how the visual system works as a physical object in the physical world.

674
00:52:00,999 --> 00:52:03,280
And I must say, more power to them.

675
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:09,039
And as I say every once in a while, Walter Freeman has made progress in this respect, and J.J.

676
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,359
Gibson has made progress in this respect.

677
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:18,560
I mean, it's true that at Merle-Ponty's time, the neuropeople didn't have anything helpful to say.

678
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:26,479
And the Gestaltists, when they looked for their fields in the brain, which they actually did, didn't find any that corresponded to the fields.

679
00:52:26,479 --> 00:52:39,200
They were hoping to find the ways in which the fields in the brain came to equilibrium, the way the perceptions, say, of the trees in the boat came, the masks in the trees came to equilibrium.

680
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:46,640
They were thinking, look, soap bubbles come to equilibrium by the least action, making it into a sphere.

681
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:51,040
We ought to be able to find the least action principles going on in the brain.

682
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:52,319
And they didn't.

683
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,039
I think there are two issues here that we need to distinguish.

684
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:02,000
One is the prejudice of the world, which the Gestalt technologists are making as well.

685
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,640
Oh, yeah, the Gestalts.

686
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,759
Everybody does pretty much.

687
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,999
They also believe that there's this determination.

688
00:53:07,999 --> 00:53:10,080
Well, I mean, it's a presupposition of naturalism.

689
00:53:10,879 --> 00:53:17,599
That the principle involves presupposing from the get-go that there is this natural science process.

690
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:18,639
I'm going to get to that.

691
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,439
I see what you mean.

692
00:53:19,439 --> 00:53:29,039
Yeah, when I talked about the lines of the motor liar illusion, which is how it came up in Jennifer's seminar, yes, there's a double objection to Gestaltists.

693
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,639
You're giving the sort of idealist metaphysical one.

694
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,159
Right now, we're just getting the fact that they shouldn't be naturalists.

695
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:40,560
Later, we're going to find out, and they shouldn't believe in physical causality.

696
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:45,039
Later, we're going to find out they shouldn't even believe in the objective, the external world.

697
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:53,559
But that's a distinct issue from the other issue, which is whether or not what's really out there at Serbus Age is brute meaningless stuff.

698
00:53:53,879 --> 00:53:57,559
And we're imposing the observer relative meaning onto the brute meaningless stuff.

699
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:00,119
So the Gestalt psychologists also believe in that.

700
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:00,759
Do they?

701
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:01,319
I think so.

702
00:54:01,319 --> 00:54:07,319
And that's where Bronze McCook is going to disagree by saying that, you know, I'm not convinced about that.

703
00:54:07,319 --> 00:54:08,599
You'll have to tell me that later.

704
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:10,359
Really?

705
00:54:10,359 --> 00:54:10,760
I don't know.

706
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,720
The imminent meaning.

707
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:14,679
And I don't.

708
00:54:14,919 --> 00:54:15,720
Well, where is the immune?

709
00:54:15,959 --> 00:54:16,839
Right after what you're reading.

710
00:54:16,839 --> 00:54:17,240
Now is that.

711
00:54:17,959 --> 00:54:19,959
Okay, let me read that sentence.

712
00:54:19,959 --> 00:54:26,680
Now, as we've seen, the perception of our own body and the perception of external things provided an example of non-causing consciousness.

713
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:31,880
That means not explicitly directed toward a determinate object.

714
00:54:31,879 --> 00:54:35,240
That is, a consciousness not in possession of a fully determinate object.

715
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,200
That's what he's interested in.

716
00:54:36,919 --> 00:54:38,599
That of the logic lived through.

717
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,560
That's motivation, which cannot account for itself.

718
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,959
And that of an imminent being, which is not clear to itself.

719
00:54:44,839 --> 00:54:45,879
Yeah, but that's fine.

720
00:54:45,879 --> 00:54:46,920
He's all for that.

721
00:54:46,919 --> 00:54:52,200
That an imminent being is not clear to itself and becomes fully aware only through experiencing certain natural signs.

722
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,079
Now read the next sentence.

723
00:54:54,039 --> 00:54:58,119
These phenomena cannot be assimilated by objective thought, and that is why Gestalt psychology.

724
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,640
Well, that's what I think is wrong.

725
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:02,119
I mean, I don't, I think he's just cheating.

726
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:11,959
The Gestalt psychologists have been describing in detail how imminent meaning becomes explicit, how the indeterminate becomes determinate.

727
00:55:12,839 --> 00:55:14,359
That's their game.

728
00:55:14,359 --> 00:55:14,839
And no?

729
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:15,719
I don't think so.

730
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:16,359
You don't think so?

731
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:20,119
I mean, it's a question of what Gestalt psychologists are trying to do and what he needs.

732
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,879
Maybe he's misunderstanding the development.

733
00:55:22,039 --> 00:55:23,639
No, I think he's not misunderstanding them.

734
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:28,919
They're trying to do two things at once, which I think is okay and he thinks is illegitimate.

735
00:55:28,919 --> 00:55:41,839
They're trying to give a motivation from indeterminate to determinate, from unbalanced form to form, story about our experience, and then trying to find a causal basis for that in the brain.

736
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:47,439
And that naturalism, that belief in the physical world, is their problem.

737
00:55:47,919 --> 00:55:49,839
I agree with that the way you put it.

738
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:56,319
But then the question is, in the, for example, if we just take water, is water drinkable?

739
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:09,039
I think the Gestaltists would be happy with the Gibsonian talk of affordances.

740
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:11,839
Why shouldn't they say the water looks to us?

741
00:56:11,999 --> 00:56:13,519
In fact, we know they say that.

742
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:14,880
The water looks drinkable.

743
00:56:14,879 --> 00:56:19,919
But if they say that, then that's not the objective world in the sense that we don't think he's going to criticize.

744
00:56:19,999 --> 00:56:20,319
That's right.

745
00:56:23,919 --> 00:56:26,559
It's all just about H2O, but not off the drinkability.

746
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:27,599
Right.

747
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:45,519
But notice that it's just unfair to the Gestaltists to say that they aren't aware that the water looks drinkable and the women looks lovable and this is what you were quoted as Kafka, one of the big of the two, they're two big Gestalt people, Werrheimer and Kafka.

748
00:56:45,519 --> 00:56:48,079
I get quoted all the time in the footnotes of Sidney.

749
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:52,319
So the Gestaltists were the first to make a big fuss about affordances.

750
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:53,839
But they were still Cartesian.

751
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,159
Well, let's go we'll get there.

752
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:07,600
I'm just gonna but but it's unfair to say if they didn't have any notion of motives and they didn't have any notion of affordances, they only believed in the realism of causal thinking, which is at the bottom.

753
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:25,079
That if in unless he just hasn't been reading a word of it, which makes no sense, he must, he means there that they expected to find objective, determinate, independent, physical, causal stuff underlying what they described.

754
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,280
And they can't do that.

755
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:26,760
Isn't that?

756
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,120
Are you disagreeing about that?

757
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:30,760
I agree with you as far as the truth of the matter goes, I think.

758
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,519
Okay, well, I'm trying to help him out as usual.

759
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:39,160
I think that's kind of a problem because, you know, maybe he really just doesn't have a couple lines he views.

760
00:57:39,399 --> 00:57:41,959
Okay, well, this would be beyond Laffey.

761
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:44,199
This would be sort of schizophrenic.

762
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:58,200
Having just used all this Vestal talk about motive, indeterminate, affording, soliciting, and so forth to say that they don't have it, that they need new categories so they can talk like he did when he was just talking like they did.

763
00:57:58,999 --> 00:58:00,839
That would be too crazy for words.

764
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:01,720
So I'm doing this.

765
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:04,120
I can't believe he's that crazy.

766
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,640
Anyway, so here's what I think.

767
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:20,280
He knows all that about Vestal psychology, and he knows that they made this big mistake from his point of view of expecting to find causal basis, causal correlatives in the brain for what they were talking about.

768
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,920
And as I keep saying, they didn't.

769
00:58:24,439 --> 00:58:29,159
But I want to say just one last time that Walter Freeman does.

770
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,800
The fields are now chaotic attractors.

771
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:41,880
They didn't know about chaotic attractors in his day, although he had this one amazing moment when he said what goes on in the brain should be described in terms of vortices.

772
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:46,679
I don't know where he got that, but he was looking in the right direction.

773
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:59,080
They didn't have it, and and the narrow tanti thinks that they shouldn't have it, and that he even had an idea about how the brain should be described as really alien to his project.

774
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:00,359
Think about this.

775
00:59:00,359 --> 00:59:16,080
For those of you who've got the structure of behavior, and look at these interesting footnotes taking you to interesting parts of the structure of behavior, there he's very interested in how the brain does it and has proposals and objections and so forth.

776
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:26,640
That's because the structure of behavior is written, so to speak, from within a belief in the objective world and science and the brain as a functioning object.

777
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:31,680
It's prior to the move to idealism which he makes in the phenomenology of perception.

778
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,720
This isn't a mistake.

779
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:33,839
I mean, he knows that.

780
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:47,120
He first gives uh he wants to give the best story that you can give on the level of the objective world and try to figure out how the brain does it because there does do there really seem to be brains seeming to do it.

781
00:59:47,120 --> 01:00:06,319
And then having done that, he wants to make the move we're making right now to sending, of course, that whole idea of a completely determinate objective world with its objective causes underlying our indeterminate behavior with its motivations is a big mistake.

782
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:18,240
And so he goes from the structure of behavior to rethink it philosophically, ontologically, and in a kind of idealism, which is where we are.

783
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:28,560
But it's good to go back and see what goes on in structured behavior because he has lots of interesting things to say about what's wrong with the current brain science in his day and lots of hints about why it might be better.

784
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:29,200
Yeah.

785
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:43,680
I I probably I mostly the first part of today was then trying to make sense that he's talking about creation and constitution without attributing to him the belief that the subject actually creates or constitutes it.

786
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,679
But they're ending now by saying that he is in fact an idealist.

787
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,559
So if you said that he's an idealist, why not?

788
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,999
Well, I'm going to do this way.

789
01:00:46,479 --> 01:00:53,639
No problem.

790
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,199
I have 15 minutes to do it.

791
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,159
But that's right.

792
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,439
And I think we have to, there's a very important teaching.

793
01:01:00,439 --> 01:01:02,839
I'll just say it right now, and then I've got to show it.

794
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:11,159
If you don't make the distinction between world and universe, you can't understand anything that I've been saying and he's been saying up to now.

795
01:01:11,479 --> 01:01:14,279
And so that's what I'm about to get there.

796
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:20,679
So we got the unfair critique of Gestalt, and then we got their new category.

797
01:01:20,999 --> 01:01:30,200
And what he thinks is now his story is that what are the new categories that he wants to use?

798
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,439
What is the phenomenal field going to tell us?

799
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:41,560
The phenomenal field tractor is going to tell us that the world, the perceptual world, is not determinate ever.

800
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:47,960
But is always, we're always moving to get more determinacy and more of a grip on objects.

801
01:01:47,959 --> 01:01:52,839
But there's always more indeterminacy because whenever you get a figure, there's always a background.

802
01:01:52,839 --> 01:02:01,160
And that's the way the world, the objective, perceptual world, this world.

803
01:02:01,399 --> 01:02:03,079
You can't say objective there, because that's that.

804
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:07,240
Oh, yes, you can, because I want to say he's an empirical realist like Kant.

805
01:02:07,399 --> 01:02:09,639
But he has his own technical use of the word objective.

806
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:10,680
Oh, he doesn't like objective.

807
01:02:10,999 --> 01:02:12,119
Which is the world in itself.

808
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:12,599
Oh, okay.

809
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:13,079
Sorry then.

810
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:15,879
Take back objective then.

811
01:02:15,879 --> 01:02:20,439
I would like objective, but let's just call it the shared world that we all experience and agree on.

812
01:02:20,439 --> 01:02:23,399
So he says perceived world technical terms.

813
01:02:23,399 --> 01:02:24,040
Very good.

814
01:02:24,039 --> 01:02:30,440
So he's got a view about the perceived world and how it's indeterminate and so forth.

815
01:02:30,439 --> 01:02:39,600
And he's got a view, and this is where we have to get now, about how this is always covered up by experience.

816
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:44,720
Only funny, I didn't write down, and now I've got a problem where he says that.

817
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,440
Well, I'll find it in a minute.

818
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:49,600
Ah, here we are.

819
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,000
On page 58.

820
01:02:53,039 --> 01:03:18,880
So the idea is now that when we respond to these solidifications, when the body schema responds to the motivation and makes the objects of our experience determinate, we can't help reading back into our experience the idea that that determinate object was there all along and it was determinate all along.

821
01:03:18,879 --> 01:03:20,959
That's the retroactive illusion.

822
01:03:20,959 --> 01:03:22,880
That's the crypto mechanism.

823
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:26,720
That's what he wants to say to all of you who are sitting here and saying that this is utter nonsense.

824
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,200
The world is full of completely determinate objects.

825
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:35,199
Look, there, strike this Jennifer Beautiful yellow car and dia form Carmen D out there.

826
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,000
They're all as determinate as you could get.

827
01:03:37,999 --> 01:03:39,839
And the answer is: no, they're not.

828
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:45,440
You just manage to make them determinate by focusing your attention on them.

829
01:03:45,999 --> 01:03:52,000
And in fact, there is a basic indeterminacy in experience.

830
01:03:51,999 --> 01:03:54,079
And this is what he's saying at the top of 58.

831
01:03:54,080 --> 01:04:07,120
To the degree, and this is in the last paragraph of the technique, to the degree, to the degree that the motivated phenomena comes into being, an internal relation to the motivating phenomenon appears.

832
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:10,560
The motivated phenomenon is the determinate object.

833
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:15,039
The motivating phenomenon is the tension.

834
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:32,519
Hence, instead of the one nearly succeeding the other, that is, the tension comes and then the determinate object, the motivated phenomenon, the determinate object, makes the motivating phenomenon explicit and comprehensible and seems to have pre-existed its own motive.

835
01:04:32,519 --> 01:04:34,679
That's a complicated way of putting it.

836
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:44,280
That says, it explains why there was a tension and why this was an answer by saying because there was a yellow and orange folks fogging there all along.

837
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:45,879
That is true.

838
01:04:46,039 --> 01:04:49,559
And now, let me just skip a second, and you'll see that this is what's going on.

839
01:04:49,560 --> 01:05:01,240
We place beforehand within perception a science constructed upon it, and we lose sight of the original relationship of motivation in which distance springs into existence ahead of any science.

840
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:12,280
Not from a judgment of the two images, so these are not numerically distinct, but from the phenomenon of the shift, from the forces which reside in this rough outline, which are trying to come to rest.

841
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:21,720
I mean, how much more anthropomorphizing of this tension is that trying to come to rest, which read it to the most determinate form possible.

842
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:33,240
So we read that whole story back into the world as it would read the result back into the world and think the world is the determinate objects.

843
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:40,040
And it's because they are already determinate that they solicit us to get the key to unlock them.

844
01:05:40,039 --> 01:05:42,680
But they are not like that.

845
01:05:43,319 --> 01:05:47,000
They are being determinate depends on us.

846
01:05:46,999 --> 01:05:48,680
We have to make them determinate.

847
01:05:48,999 --> 01:05:51,399
It's like it's related to authorities.

848
01:05:51,399 --> 01:05:59,640
I mean, the being author in eating is not a feature of things in the universe.

849
01:05:59,959 --> 01:06:04,720
And neither are these determinate objects features of things in the universe.

850
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:09,839
They are, I'm going to show you the quotes in a minute, features of things in the world.

851
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:28,480
The world is this perceptual, shared experience of lots of determinate objects, but always falling in and out of determination, covered up by this tendency to think that it's all determinate.

852
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,880
I see a hand up there.

853
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:31,599
Go ahead.

854
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:33,439
Oh, I'm getting there.

855
01:06:33,439 --> 01:06:34,079
I'm getting there.

856
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:37,679
We're still in the world story, but almost ready to get there.

857
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:38,399
Let me see now.

858
01:06:38,399 --> 01:06:41,359
I just want to say, where is it now?

859
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:43,520
Okay, we've explained it all.

860
01:06:43,519 --> 01:06:45,280
Oh, yeah, there's a crucial line.

861
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:49,280
I teach saying something, or I thought I'd been saying it, about crypto mechanisms.

862
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:58,400
To do that, you have to jump to the phenomenal field chapter, a paragraph that begins this phenomenal field, which is about five pages in.

863
01:06:58,399 --> 01:07:06,560
And it's way in a paragraph that begins with this phenomenal field, about two-thirds of the way.

864
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:10,639
Now, nothing is more difficult than to know precisely what we see.

865
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,319
I quoted that once before.

866
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:20,319
There was a natural intuition of a sort of cryptomechanism, which we have to break in order to reach phenomenal being.

867
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:24,800
Or again, a dialectic whereby perception hides itself from itself.

868
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:40,319
And although it is of the essence of consciousness to forget its own phenomena, although thus enabling things to be constituted, now constituted here means articulated or to take shape in our experience.

869
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:47,559
It doesn't mean mind imposing form on matter, but things coming into clarity.

870
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:51,399
It enables things to come into clarity, to become determinate.

871
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:57,800
This forgetfulness is not mere absence, it's the absence of something which consciousness could bring into its presence.

872
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:05,399
Now, that little clause says, well, we phenomenologists can break the crypto mechanism, otherwise he'd have nothing to write about.

873
01:08:06,039 --> 01:08:08,680
He's just saying, yes, of course it's all covered up.

874
01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:13,959
Yes, of course you think there's objects out there all already determinate causing you to have these experiences.

875
01:08:13,959 --> 01:08:35,079
But if you read this book and you look at experiences like the trees and the mass and the trees and you look at brain-injured people and you look at children and all this will lead you to realize that there is this indeterminate perceptual world and you will be able to break out of this.

876
01:08:35,079 --> 01:08:46,680
Although whenever you leave the study like Hume when he left his study to play billiards then he couldn't anymore even remember what he was, the weird things he was saying.

877
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:51,399
So I think Mira Lafontee when he eats dinner probably thinks the dinner is completely determined.

878
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:55,239
But if you're doing phenomenology you can resist that.

879
01:08:55,239 --> 01:08:57,319
Okay now we get to idealism.

880
01:08:58,199 --> 01:09:03,879
So we're going to criticize the Schaefer realism and see what I think I've already done that.

881
01:09:03,879 --> 01:09:06,599
So I'm going to go back in a little bit.

882
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:07,560
Well not really.

883
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:08,520
I think I'm 54.

884
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:09,800
Have I met 54 yet?

885
01:09:09,959 --> 01:09:10,839
I don't know anymore.

886
01:09:10,919 --> 01:09:12,999
Criticizing this fault realism.

887
01:09:12,999 --> 01:09:15,720
Okay, but there's a reason why I want to do it back there.

888
01:09:16,039 --> 01:09:18,199
So let me go back to 54.

889
01:09:18,199 --> 01:09:22,199
And now I don't know where I am for the other guys, unless I've cited it already.

890
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:25,159
It's after that long footnote.

891
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:36,480
However, he says, However, the psychologists, which always needs to be fault psychologists, who practice the description of the phenomenon are not normally aware of the philosophical implications of their method.

892
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:37,520
No, I haven't read that yet.

893
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:40,159
This is the transition to idealism.

894
01:09:40,159 --> 01:09:58,159
They do not see that the return to perceptual experience, insofar as it is a consequential and radical reform, consequently that English, I would think in English it's consistent, insofar as it's a consistent and a radical reform, puts out of court all forms of realism.

895
01:09:58,159 --> 01:10:03,839
That is to say, all philosophies which leave consciousness until it's given one of its results.

896
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:05,119
That's enough.

897
01:10:05,119 --> 01:10:20,479
So the idea is once you understand how the perceptual world works, then you understand that there isn't any completely determinate external world, and you can't be a realist.

898
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,400
Let me find you more quotes, though.

899
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,520
I'm going to read you now.

900
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:34,159
No, he's turning Gestalt, he's turning against Gestalt's realism, and he's proposing a kind of idealism.

901
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:37,760
It's an interesting kind of idealism because it's like Kant.

902
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,680
How many of you had the Kant course?

903
01:10:39,999 --> 01:10:50,879
Okay, when Kant says he's an empirical realist and a transcendental idealist, Merloponi is sort of like that, so we have to draw a little bit different distinctions and boundaries.

904
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:58,079
But Kant says he knows that the public world is public and shared and so forth.

905
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:02,559
It's just that it's only an appearance.

906
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,279
He calls it appearances.

907
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:13,999
He calls it phenomena because it hasn't got the kind of complete objective character that people think it has.

908
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:18,279
If it did, it would lead to terrible antinomies, which I won't go into.

909
01:11:18,279 --> 01:11:27,959
So you have to believe that the world is never completed, never completely determinate, but nonetheless, in Kant language, objective.

910
01:11:27,959 --> 01:11:35,959
In Merlot-Ponty language, we have to say public, shared, stable, and so forth, or relatively stable.

911
01:11:36,839 --> 01:11:42,680
So, so, insofar, so what kind of idealist is he then?

912
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:54,839
Well, he's already a kind of idealist when he says that this is a world of appearances, a phenomenal world, a world that wouldn't have the character if it did have, except for us.

913
01:11:54,839 --> 01:12:09,800
If we disappeared, there wouldn't be the indeterminacy changing to determinateness, and there wouldn't be the sort of objects out there with determinate properties which we retroactively read into our experience.

914
01:12:09,959 --> 01:12:11,879
That's pretty idealistic.

915
01:12:11,879 --> 01:12:17,800
But what's, and I don't object to that, I'm just telling you where I stand, that he's made a good case for that.

916
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:23,800
That this is a world, the perceptual world is a world of appearances, a phenomenal world.

917
01:12:24,119 --> 01:12:30,359
And he set you up for this way back on page six when he said that we compose the world.

918
01:12:30,999 --> 01:12:33,800
I don't see the quote anymore, but I quoted it way back.

919
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,919
He did say that anyway, we composed the world.

920
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:41,959
So now he's sort of pulled, you know, he's cashed in on that.

921
01:12:41,959 --> 01:12:43,479
And that's okay.

922
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:44,680
But what's wrong?

923
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:51,479
Well, what's really wrong is he thinks that he's got something to say about physics and the universe.

924
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:59,159
It isn't obvious at all that just because the perceptual world depends on us, that electrons depend on us.

925
01:12:59,159 --> 01:13:06,879
For all we know, and I believe, there are electrons out there, and they have a spin, and they have a charge, and they have a mass, and that's all very determinate.

926
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:08,640
Maybe electrons are a little fuzzy.

927
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,279
If so, take something else more determinate.

928
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:18,159
Galaxies are pretty determinate, very determinate, and have our causal history and so forth.

929
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:34,800
It's just wrong to think that because we could only get to the physical world by starting with the perceptual world and then doing lots of interesting things with it, that the physical world in any way depends on the perceptual world.

930
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,599
But that is what he thinks.

931
01:13:37,919 --> 01:13:47,680
He says, for instance, on 11, I just collected the quotes because Jennifer and I were discussing this, and this is just bad, about 10 lines from the bottom.

932
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:53,119
The scientist too must learn to criticize the idea of an external world in itself.

933
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:56,399
I don't think the scientist needs to learn that at all.

934
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:03,439
I think Merle-Ponty needs to learn that the access that he's been describing, what I would call access practices.

935
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:10,159
I mean, there's lots, without the perceptual world, we'd never get access to the external world as it is in itself.

936
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:12,959
But that doesn't prove that there isn't any external world.

937
01:14:12,959 --> 01:14:15,439
It just tells how we get access to it.

938
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,600
At least that's a possible view.

939
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,079
You don't have to believe this realistic.

940
01:14:20,079 --> 01:14:38,159
You just have to see that it, at least I think, makes sense to see that Merlot-Ponty hasn't the right to go from his phenomenalism with respect, or let's call it idealism, okay, with respect to the perceptual world, to goes to idealism with respect to the universe.

941
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:39,839
It's just a non-secular.

942
01:14:39,839 --> 01:14:40,239
Yeah.

943
01:14:41,839 --> 01:14:45,400
Well, there's a sense there's a way of understanding that science.

944
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,999
The scientist who was going to criticize the idea of an external world in myself.

945
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:51,640
What's wrong with that?

946
01:14:51,640 --> 01:15:06,680
Well, what makes all of this worky when you talk about it is that I hear a lot of Heideggerian influences in this, and I just want to call attention to the fact that there is an intermediate position between the Lookan's view and I guess the traditional realist view.

947
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:08,520
And I think that's the place for Heidegger.

948
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,600
Because I don't think you actually believe what you just said.

949
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,600
I believe exactly what it's said.

950
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:22,999
One of my greatest things that I want to say that external world isn't something that you would agree with.

951
01:15:22,999 --> 01:15:23,640
Well, I'll say that.

952
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:24,279
I see what you do.

953
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:28,919
Do you believe that there is an external world and it's an intelligible question of those in their external world?

954
01:15:28,999 --> 01:15:30,039
Do you think that's an intelligible question?

955
01:15:30,199 --> 01:15:32,279
Well, let's not go into Kantianism.

956
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:41,239
I mean, into that, if external world means that there's an internal world that's corresponding to it, of course, I don't believe it.

957
01:15:41,239 --> 01:15:42,680
No Heideggerian does.

958
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:46,680
But the way it's put here, it's sort of innocent, the external world.

959
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:48,440
You don't think it's innocent.

960
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:49,959
Well, I'll find you other ones then.

961
01:15:49,959 --> 01:15:53,239
I mean, yeah, there's another view of that segment.

962
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:54,520
Okay, let's find that.

963
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:55,879
Okay, let's go to page 10.

964
01:15:55,879 --> 01:15:57,079
10 and yours.

965
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:58,279
11 and mine.

966
01:15:58,279 --> 01:15:58,839
Okay.

967
01:15:58,839 --> 01:16:12,999
Which is just that there was talking about a particular Heidegger scientist, namely a scientist who is studying perception and that scientist who studied perception, not electrons, needs to take the lesson for combos and okay.

968
01:16:12,999 --> 01:16:14,439
In that case, you're right.

969
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:15,959
It could be read that way.

970
01:16:16,279 --> 01:16:17,560
Let's read it that way.

971
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:20,199
But then he's still an idealist without science.

972
01:16:20,199 --> 01:16:21,239
We'll find another quote.

973
01:16:21,239 --> 01:16:22,519
That's why I grant you.

974
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:23,800
But it applies to electrons, too.

975
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,159
But I mean, but that is the important point.

976
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:41,279
Yeah, it's ambiguous the way, but there, and he certainly correctly means if you don't believe he wants you not to think that you could do a science of the mind using causes and reasons.

977
01:16:41,279 --> 01:16:47,439
He's not a cognitivist and he's not a behaviorist, and if those are the scientists, they've got it wrong.

978
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:51,119
They have to bring indeterminacy into it and so forth.

979
01:16:51,119 --> 01:16:59,999
But he is getting out of this a conclusion that the universe somehow depends on us, and I'll find you wherever he does it.

980
01:17:00,959 --> 01:17:08,879
Well, at the bottom of 28, he talks about interesting way to put it, which I think is very revealing.

981
01:17:08,879 --> 01:17:17,199
He says we have to discover the natural world too and its mode of existence, which is not to be confused with the scientific object.

982
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:27,680
Now, I take that to be a way of saying we have to discover the shared perceptual world with its trees and animals and everything in it.

983
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:29,599
And we want that.

984
01:17:29,839 --> 01:17:31,199
We're not going to deny it.

985
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:32,560
It's a phenomenal world.

986
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:35,600
It's a world of appearances, but it's a natural world, too.

987
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,919
Nature shows up in the world of appearances.

988
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,599
Kant agrees with that.

989
01:17:39,999 --> 01:17:42,800
But we want to keep that.

990
01:17:43,119 --> 01:17:49,199
But we don't want to confuse it with a scientific object, because if we did, we'd be realists about science.

991
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:51,039
And we don't want to keep that.

992
01:17:51,039 --> 01:17:52,560
That's how I read that.

993
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,199
Let's go on.

994
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:58,720
The phenomena of the backgrounds continuing under the figure and seeing under the figure what it's exactly.

995
01:17:58,879 --> 01:18:00,399
No, that's not going to help him.

996
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,039
Let's just stop with that.

997
01:18:02,999 --> 01:18:05,439
Uh yes, time is up.

998
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,839
Anyway, but that's exactly how much I wanted to say.

999
01:18:07,839 --> 01:18:14,559
And I don't want it, if I could help it, to go back into the realism idealism issue, but it had to be brought up in once.

1000
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:15,119
Okay.

1001
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:20,039
Somebody come up and tell me how if they'll give me the last two things.
