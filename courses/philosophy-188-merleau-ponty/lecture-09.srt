00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
Okay, so in light of all that, I'll just go ahead and get started with number two there: traditional realism.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,320
So, the traditional realist picture of the world is, I can kind of just draw it as a picture.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:19,359
We can take this to be the world in itself, you know, WII, and this is the world for us.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:33,919
And this just corresponds to the general subject-object distinction, whereas all this is the objective world, and this is the subjective or intersubjective.

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:43,799
So, this is the world in itself, and the kind of a traditional common sense understanding is that this is what natural science does.

6
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,880
This is what's really out there.

7
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:57,880
This is what you see through science, which has the view from nowhere, or you could say the God's eye view, the way in which a lot of people traditionally talked about the world in itself.

8
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:03,000
And then the world for us, well, that's how we, you know, that's our experience of things.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,959
And in the world for us, that's where you, where some people, well, where a lot of people will say, that's where colors are.

10
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,560
And more importantly, you know, moral and ethical values are just part of the world for us.

11
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,960
So, you know, right and wrong aren't in the world in itself, that is in that world of natural science studies.

12
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:24,120
It's just in the world for us.

13
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:33,800
So in the traditional realist setup, you have the problem of how the world in itself relates to the world for us.

14
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:43,399
And so here's where you generate, among other things, the problem of appearance and reality and the problem of the external world and stuff like that.

15
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:53,559
For our purposes, though, I just want to emphasize this kind of this division between the objective and the subjective and the idea of a world in itself or a world for us.

16
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:01,879
So the natural way of understanding Malo-Ponte's prejudice of the world is that he's going to tell us, well, there is no world in itself.

17
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,159
That's the prejudice of the world.

18
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,320
They believe that there is a world in itself.

19
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:12,359
Now, if there is no world in itself, it kind of makes us wonder, you know, how are we to understand this?

20
00:02:12,359 --> 00:02:16,360
Because this only makes sense in contrast to the world in itself.

21
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:22,880
So moving on to the Gestalt psychologist, you know, they basically held this traditional picture that I've been describing.

22
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:28,640
And Merlot Ponte explicitly criticizes the Gestalt psychologist for being naturalists.

23
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:40,560
Now, I think the, I'm going to go through one of the important insights in depth of Gestalt psychology, and that's the understanding of a demand character.

24
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,560
I'll get to that there.

25
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:55,680
But for now, you know, I'll just reiterate some of the basic things we get from the Gestalt psychologist, the understanding that there's a figure ground perception, and we perceive figures on grounds.

26
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:09,360
And when it comes to understanding behavior, the Gestalt psychologist wanted to emphasize that we need to see the structure or the forms, the holistic nature of behavior.

27
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,479
So the Lopon T really discusses this in the structure of behavior.

28
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,400
So I actually haven't said this yet, but it's worth emphasizing.

29
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:30,320
In preparation for this, I really have to reread half of Merlot's The Structure of Behavior, because that's where that's where he really treats all of this stuff.

30
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:36,480
So you're kind of at a disadvantage in reading the phenomenology, because you haven't read the structure of behavior.

31
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:43,040
That said, if you think the phenomenology is hard to read, this is much easier, really a pain in the neck to read.

32
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,279
And it's written in a very different style.

33
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,839
It's more scientific, but it's still very difficult.

34
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:59,679
What's interesting and important about this book is that it ends with precisely the question we care about at the beginning of the phenomenology of perception.

35
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:07,200
So the very last section of this book is called something like, you know, is there not a truth of naturalism?

36
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:15,320
And so I was reading all this to see if I could find some justification from Merlot-Ponte of why he rejects the prejudice of the world.

37
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,760
Because it seems very often to start the phenomenology that way.

38
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,079
It seems like, if anything, that should be something he tries to prove.

39
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,960
So in reading this, he doesn't actually articulate the prejudice of the world in this book.

40
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:37,560
But I do think that in this book we'll find support for his rejection of the prejudice of the world.

41
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:47,400
And so that's partly what was motivating my whole attempt to penetrate into Merlot-Ponte's relation to the Geschalt psychology.

42
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,040
Excuse me, Ben?

43
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:56,120
Where in the phenomenology of perception does he say that he rejects the prejudice of the world?

44
00:04:57,239 --> 00:05:01,800
The first time he mentions it is around, it's in the first chapter.

45
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,640
And so he called it the prejudice of determinate being, and then it comes up again and again.

46
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,839
At one point, he calls it a prejudice of the world.

47
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:18,440
And other times he calls it the prejudice of an objective world in itself.

48
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:26,360
But yeah, but the very first time he mentions it is really four pages or so into it.

49
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,560
Actually, page six on this, Prejudice about the world.

50
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,520
Page six.

51
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,360
Oh, yeah.

52
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,800
Well, it's about three or four.

53
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:37,320
It's a little bit before the picture of the Mueller liar illusion.

54
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:46,600
So what's peculiar is that the prejudice, rejecting the prejudice of the world is such a radical, fundamental, essential element to Merlot-Ponty's metaphysics.

55
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:49,880
And it's how he's probably starting off the phenomenology.

56
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:57,360
So, you know, with respect to the Geschalt psychology, Merlot-Ponty criticizes them for having the prejudice of the world.

57
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,280
Is something on your mind?

58
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,920
Well, what he says here, he doesn't seem to be saying that there's sending a world to the world.

59
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:18,560
Because he seems to be rejecting certain assumptions that the experience of the world is determinant in ways that you think the world is determined.

60
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:25,359
But that's different from saying there is no world in itself.

61
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,999
Well, yeah, he says that elsewhere.

62
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,079
About specifically there is no...

63
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:42,240
So he has all of these idealistic kind of claims of how we can't conceive of a world without a subject and stuff like that.

64
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:46,159
So I mean, I'm not saying that right here on this page he's going to spell it out.

65
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,880
I think part of the problem of the book is that he doesn't spell it out.

66
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,160
But it's kind of a recurring theme throughout the book.

67
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:04,000
So I mean, just looking through, I see on page 45 here he says, he started off from a world in itself, which acted upon our eyes so as to cause it blah, blah, blah.

68
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:08,880
And so, I mean, all of this, I kind of have it all marked up in my book whenever he mentions it.

69
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:11,440
So, I mean, I can just kind of flip through it.

70
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:24,000
But it's whatever he talks about, the belief that there is a determinant world, or a world understood as part of five parts.

71
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:32,320
So that, you know, again, I mean, I guess, you know, for my students in the section, I've been pointing these passages out left and right.

72
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,079
But it's just something that comes up throughout the book.

73
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:50,920
But I do understand your kind of, I do see what you're getting at on how on that page six, he doesn't put together the entire sense that I'm giving to the prejudice of the world.

74
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,280
So moving on to what the Geschalt psychologists are saying.

75
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:10,680
The Geschalt psychologists thought that you could build up a meaningful perceived world of forms and structures from the meaningless forms and structures of the objective world of science, you know, that is the world in itself.

76
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:25,560
The interesting problem in studying behavior, as Merlot Pine C concentrates on the structure of behavior, is that the structure, is that the scientific understanding of behavior must recognize the forms and structures that exist for the behaving animal.

77
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:35,160
So this was the main contribution of the Geschalt psychologist as far as Merlot-Pine C can tell in the structure of behavior.

78
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:52,520
The Geschal psychologists showed how we can build up an understanding of animals, of animal behavior, by supposing that they're just, that behavior is just a bunch of isolated reflexes, you know, that kind of linear causality which we addressed earlier in the course.

79
00:08:52,839 --> 00:09:09,160
So you need to understand the animal as responding to the forms and the structures of its situation, as opposed to just atomic parts of its environment understood as a kind of physical, as a combination of physical stimuli.

80
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:20,600
So the Geschalt psychologists wanted to show not just that there are forms and structures for the behaving animals, but that all reality operates with forms and structures rather than atomic units.

81
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:25,360
So this is the metaphysical side of Gestalt psychology that's important to see.

82
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,800
Gestalt psychology presupposes an entire naturalistic metaphysic.

83
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,160
And in doing so, they want to give us a different understanding of the natural sciences.

84
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:51,040
So the Gestalt psychologists don't think that ordinary behavior, that to understand the science of ordinary behavior, that you can suppose that there are atomic units as opposed to structures, forms, and situations.

85
00:09:51,359 --> 00:10:00,960
But what they did, which was so unique, was to go beyond that in suggesting that the physical world is also not atomic.

86
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,839
In other words, the world of physics also has structure and form.

87
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:25,520
So that's why one of the examples that comes up again and again in the phenomenology is the example of a soap bubble or an oil drop, where the soap bubble we need to understand as kind of a tendency to form the shape of a bubble as a way of solving the problem of maximum and minimum.

88
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:35,200
So inside the bubble, the air is trying to maximize its volume, whereas the bubble itself is trying to stick together.

89
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,759
And so even physics we should understand as having structures and forms.

90
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,119
So far so good.

91
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,200
What's the Gestalt psychologist's mistake according to Verlopins here?

92
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:58,959
Well, what the Gestalt psychologists got wrong, according to Verlo-Pointee, is that they suppose that the forms and structures of behavior operated in a merely causal way without explaining the meaning of those forms.

93
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:08,920
So that's the big difference between the structure that goes into the equilibrium of a soap bubble and the structure that goes into the kind of equilibrium manifested in an animal's behavior.

94
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:18,519
The Gestalt psychologists recognized the meaningfulness of the forms and structures of behavior, but they thought that they were somehow in the organism's mind.

95
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:24,360
So the Gestalt psychologists don't really write that way, so it's kind of deceptive.

96
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:31,400
And it's actually very confusing to read this book if you don't know the Gestalt psychology jargon.

97
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:41,799
But the problem is: if what's really out there are meaningless forms, how do the forms and structures of behavior get their meaning?

98
00:11:42,759 --> 00:12:02,119
So by restricting their understanding of behavior to the kind of causal interaction of forms, the Gestalt psychologists kind of recognize that there is meaning to these forms, but it's not clear how their metaphysics can account for where the meaningfulness of these forms comes from.

99
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,119
In other words, where the meaningfulness of the objects in the world comes from.

100
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:17,879
So despite the Gestalt psychologists' opposition to crude atomism, they didn't go far enough in seeing that you can get meaningful forms of behavior from the meaningless forms of physics.

101
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:26,920
Instead, according to Merleau-Ponty, it should recognize that the perceived world itself is already meaningful and doesn't merely seem to be meaningful.

102
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,479
And it's not that we subjectively endow meaning to meaningless forms.

103
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:43,239
So the clear support for this I found is actually in The Primacy of Perception, page 23, at least 23 in my newer volume.

104
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:46,200
So here's his criticism of the Gestalt psychologist.

105
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:56,239
The very psychologists who have described the perceived world as I did above, the Gestalt psychologists, have never drawn the philosophical conclusion of their description.

106
00:12:56,239 --> 00:13:02,479
In that respect, they remain within the classical framework, and by that I mean this kind of naturalism.

107
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:16,479
Ultimately, they consider the structures of the perceived world as the simple result of certain physical and physiological processes which take place in the nervous system and completely determine the Gestalten and the experience of the Gestalten.

108
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:22,559
The organism and consciousness itself are only functions of external physical variables.

109
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:31,759
Ultimately, the real world, according to the Gestalt psychologist, is the physical world as science conceives it, and it engenders our consciousness itself.

110
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:36,799
So that shows the main general flaw of Gestalt psychology's metaphysics.

111
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,039
So what's Merleau-Ponty's alternative?

112
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:56,400
Well, like the Gestalt psychologist, he believes that there are forms and structures out there which make sense of the science of behavior, and that one of the consequences of doing the science of behavior is that the scientist is forced to recognize the meaningfulness of the forms in the situation.

113
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:09,039
So this is kind of the first time when doing objective science that you're forced to bring into your understanding of what you're trying to understand the meaningfulness of the world.

114
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:16,639
I suspect that Merleau-Ponty is against naturalism because he thinks all naturalisms are reductionist.

115
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:28,079
And Merleau-Ponty thinks that it's impossible to reduce the indeterminate, meaningful forms of behavior to the determinate but meaningless forms of physics.

116
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:45,799
So I'm not sure if Merlot Ponty has any good arguments against reductionism, but I think he also believes that if you can't get a scientific reduction to meaningless forms, and I think you just think that's an in principle truth, then there can't be an objective determinate world in itself.

117
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:52,359
So this might partly clarify sometimes when Merleau-Ponty refers to actions being magical.

118
00:14:52,360 --> 00:15:02,999
I mean, it just kind of hit me how when he says that these actions are magical, I mean, we kind of give, you know, the natural thing to say is, well, that just means our current science can't understand it.

119
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:12,359
But Merleau-Ponty might be making the more radical claim that the whole way in which we're thinking of the scientific world can't, in principle, understand it.

120
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,519
And so that would be a different claim.

121
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:18,279
You know, maybe he's just being dramatic when he says that.

122
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:21,319
So, I mean, we would have to look at those passages.

123
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:31,079
But the important thing I want to get at is that in reading this, there is this sense in which he's against reductionism.

124
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:53,479
And in trying to make sense of why Merleau-Ponty is rejecting the prejudice of the world, I've just kind of come to the conclusion or I've been kind of thinking of how Merlot-Ponty's belief in the irreducibility of the perceived world might be motivating what will ultimately be, I think, a bad argument for rejecting the prejudice of the world.

125
00:15:53,479 --> 00:16:02,599
So I'm kind of in a tough spot because I want to give as reasonable a justification for Merleau-Ponty in his rejection of the prejudice of the world.

126
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:13,080
The bottom line is I don't think you can come up with a sound argument that shows that the prejudice of the world is false because I think something like the prejudice of the world is true.

127
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:16,680
So it's kind of, you know, if you're interpreting Merleau-Ponty, you're kind of in a bind.

128
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:22,200
You either believe him all the way or you have to find out why he would say these kinds of kookie things.

129
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:22,719
Yeah?

130
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:32,719
When you say that the prejudice of the world means that physical determinants objective world doesn't exist well here.

131
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:53,999
Well, I guess maybe the alternative, which maybe you would agree with, you need to say that Lilopoxi's claim that the physical determinant objective world is just the for the perceived predetermined world is maybe priority because people like scientists, traditional scientists, they're just presupposing this.

132
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:57,359
Well, he really thinks just claiming that it doesn't just have an existence.

133
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:04,479
Yeah, so he has, there are a couple places where he says something like how it's inconceivable.

134
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:07,119
How an objective, we haven't really gotten to those passages yet.

135
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,799
They're later on in the book.

136
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:25,999
But it's along the lines of how a God's idea is inconceivable sometimes will say in that given the truth of the phenomenology of perception, we can't conceive of an objective world in itself.

137
00:17:25,999 --> 00:17:28,559
So I mean this is going to get supported later on.

138
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,839
But it's something to be on the lookout for in reading the text.

139
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:37,680
And in reading guys like Willopon Zion Heider, you're going to have all kinds of different interpretations running left and right.

140
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:46,240
So if you think he's saying something else somewhere, then, you know, at least in the course of, you know, in the course of the course, that's something worth mentioning.

141
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,999
But for now, I just want to kind of outline the picture I'm going to take.

142
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,200
It is mainly the.

143
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,039
Yeah, but he's not saying that there's not something that exists.

144
00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:03,039
The question is how, and so there is, there is a, and so he's going to give us what I call, I guess, a constructivist understanding of science.

145
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:13,239
So scientists are really doing something, but we just need to understand what they're doing in a different way from understanding it as giving us a God's eye view of reality in itself.

146
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,359
But yeah, hopefully these issues will get clarified as you get around here.

147
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:19,479
I mean, this is the crux of the problem.

148
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,119
So yeah, actually, I was going to mention this point.

149
00:18:23,719 --> 00:18:26,760
So there's still the constructed objective world of science.

150
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,119
So Millo-Ponty talks about an objective world.

151
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,400
In science studies, a quote-unquote objective world.

152
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,680
But it's not an objective world in itself.

153
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:38,600
I mean, that's a subtle point.

154
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,079
But you have to keep a lookout on the distinctions he's making.

155
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:52,359
And so the important thing is that this objective world of science isn't going to be able to explain for us the meaningful behaviors in the perceived world.

156
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:58,999
So Lilloponte suggests something like this at the very end of chapter one of the book.

157
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:04,599
But instead of reading that, there's another passage also in chapter one which I want to point out.

158
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,599
So in this volume, you can borrow mine actually for the lecture.

159
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:09,399
Actually, I haven't.

160
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,359
Okay, so this is page 12 of this edition.

161
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,359
It's in the middle of the page.

162
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,039
So again, I want to understand all these big metaphysical issues.

163
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:22,119
You can borrow mine.

164
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,959
I like my old.

165
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:24,680
Yeah, old.

166
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,279
I didn't know I used to put my old copy.

167
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:30,920
Here's my old phenomenal.

168
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:32,599
More colorful.

169
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:47,639
So in the middle of the page, page 12, he writes, if we return to the objective investigations themselves, we first of all discover that the conditions external to the sensory field do not govern it part for part.

170
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:54,239
And I think that's part of the prejudice of the world, that there is a universe that exists part for part in itself, determinate.

171
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:02,400
And that they exert an effect only to the extent of making possible a basic pattern, which is what Gestalt psychology makes clear.

172
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,519
So here he's kind of recognizing the insights of the Gestalt psychologist.

173
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:13,680
But now he's going to turn the tables against the Gestalt psychologist, you know, right in the next sentence.

174
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:22,799
Then we see that within the organism, the structure depends on variables such as the biological meaning of the situation, which are no longer physical variables.

175
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,079
And that's where the Gestalt psychologists are confused.

176
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:36,639
With the result that the whole eludes the well-known instruments of physico-mathematical analysis and opens the way to another type of intelligibility.

177
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:43,200
And here he has a footnote referring to the structure of behavior, which is what we would expect in light of what I've been saying.

178
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:57,200
If we now turn back, as is done here, and I think here refers to the phenomenology, towards perceptual experience, we notice that science succeeds in constructing only a semblance of subjectivity.

179
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:03,119
It introduces sensations which are things, just where experience shows that there are meaningful patterns.

180
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:09,279
It forces the phenomenal universe into categories, which make sense only in the universe of science.

181
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:14,959
He continues a couple lines down from that on the next page.

182
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:28,319
The theory of sensation, which builds up all knowledge out of determinate qualities, offers us objects purged of all ambiguity, pure and absolute, the ideal rather than the real things of knowledge.

183
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:40,999
So another part of his criticism against the prejudice of the world might be that if the world were determinate, meaningless in its self-stuff, we'd end up with a determinate, unambiguous perceptual experience.

184
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:45,160
Now, I hope that's not what he's saying, because that's just so obviously weak.

185
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,719
In a way, it's kind of begging the question.

186
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,759
So I'm not sure if that's what he's saying or not.

187
00:21:50,759 --> 00:22:04,279
I do think he's saying that at the very least, if you're going to do the science of perception, you need to recognize perception as having a kind of you need to understand the organism is kind of exploring.

188
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:15,799
And that's why in the next chapter or two chapters later, he talks about attention, the primary and secondary acts of attention, creating or constituting the figure.

189
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,359
Again, the problem with that is we can understand that in different ways.

190
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,239
But moving on.

191
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:35,959
Okay, so what I find interesting here is that I agree with Merleau-Pincey that the Gestalt psychologists need to realize the metaphysical consequences of their own research, which should get them out of their kind of naturalism.

192
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:39,479
The problem is I don't think Merleau-Ponty's alternative works.

193
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:50,920
So what I'm going to be suggesting is not a prejudice of the world the way Merlot-Pincey calls it, but there is a kind of prejudice of the world which we need to get clear on.

194
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:56,840
So now I'm going to move on to so that's really, I think, the murkiest and most unclear part of my lecture.

195
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:03,079
So and I think it's just the result that Merlot-Poncey is just not clear on why he believes in the prejudice of the world.

196
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:08,440
It's just an incredibly fast move to throw this at the reader at the very beginning of this book.

197
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:15,400
And I think part of the dirty work and part of his motivation for believing the prejudice of the world is what he says in here.

198
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:18,200
But that's just a kind of conjecture.

199
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,200
Okay, so now I'm moving to part three of my lecture, the richness of the Thing.

200
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:31,519
So now I'm going to actually read what I think is the most important thing, well, the most striking thing I learned in studying Geschal psychology as an undergrad.

201
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,879
Kafka says this in the Principles of Gestalt Psychology.

202
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,320
So I'm quoting Kafka.

203
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,959
Kafka is actually a very good writer, unlike Merlot Ponty.

204
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:53,759
So Kafka says on page seven of the Principles of Geschal Psychology: In the pre-scientific stage, man behaves in a situation as the situation tells him to behave.

205
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,200
The primitive man, each thing says what it is and what he ought to do with it.

206
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:07,119
The fruit says, eat me, water says, drink me, thunder says, fear me, and woman says, love me.

207
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,959
So, you know, they don't call him primitive man for nothing.

208
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:14,320
But, you know, what he means there is the pre-scientific man.

209
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,239
So hopefully we're not like that anymore.

210
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:19,119
But you never know.

211
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:25,600
So anyway, the important point is that the Gestalt psychologists really paid attention to the richness of our experience of things in the world.

212
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,959
And this is what draws Merleau-Ponty to the Gestalt psychologist.

213
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:39,519
It's an important feature of the way things appear to us that they seem to call out to us, or as Kafka says, they demand or invite us to do things with them.

214
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:48,559
The problem is that when we take a step back and think about things, especially the way scientists do, we overlook the way things ordinarily appear to us.

215
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,160
So, so far, so good.

216
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,999
This sounds like Millot Ponty's idea of solicitations.

217
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:59,200
Rillo Ponte also thinks that, you know, doorknobs call out to us to be turned.

218
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:06,839
And I'm always thinking of how my niece and nephew, whenever they go into an elevator, they're pushing all the buttons.

219
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:10,920
I mean, kids must have affordances left and right.

220
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:14,520
So when you stick a kid in an elevator, they fight to see who can push the button.

221
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:17,320
And so everything with a button just stands out for kids.

222
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:20,120
It's like calling them, push me, push me.

223
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:28,119
And so this is kind of the concept of a demand character gets at.

224
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:36,519
But there's a big difference between Rerlot-Ponty's solicitations and the Gestalt psychologist's understanding of the demand character of objects.

225
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:46,519
For the Gestalt psychologist, the real objective mailbox out in the objective world does not invite us or demand us or solicit us to do anything.

226
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:49,400
Only the subjective mailbox does this.

227
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,920
Now, those aren't the exact terms that Kafka is going to use.

228
00:25:53,160 --> 00:26:03,400
And his actual terminology is very deceptive, and I had to really reread it carefully to confirm my suspicions, which I'm really getting this from J.J.

229
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,680
Gibson, who sees this problem in the Gestalt Psychologist.

230
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:10,999
But I'll talk about Gibson in this context later.

231
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:17,560
So the example Kafka uses is a mailbox.

232
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:24,920
I mean, he has different examples, but one of them is a mailbox which invites us to drop the mail in it.

233
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:31,079
But of course, it only kind of invites us to drop mail in it when we have mail that we need to drop off.

234
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:41,400
So that's part of his, you know, the kind of common sense understanding that the mailbox doesn't really call out to us to mail letters.

235
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:47,319
We're just kind of, that's just our contribution to the experience.

236
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:52,640
So, Merleau Ponty, of course, thinks that the mailbox really does solicit us.

237
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,160
It's the real mailbox, the most real mailbox that there is.

238
00:26:51,719 --> 00:26:58,319
That's the one that is soliciting us.

239
00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:03,119
So, now I'm going to go to what Merlot Ponzi calls the in-itself for us.

240
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,119
As is apparent, Merleau-Ponty thinks the mailbox does solicit us.

241
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,479
And he doesn't think that there is a world in itself, so there is no mailbox in itself.

242
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:23,519
We can talk about the mailbox the way an actual scientist would, but that would involve objective thought, which constructs the objects of science from the perceptible world.

243
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:30,079
Bines doesn't talk about the way things are in themselves, according to Merlot Ponzi, even if they think they do.

244
00:27:30,719 --> 00:27:33,040
Remember, that would be the prejudice of the world.

245
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,920
But Merleau-Pine T has a slight problem here.

246
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,880
All things in the perceived world appear to us as if they were things in themselves.

247
00:27:40,879 --> 00:27:45,519
Moreover, these things are the most real things around, given Merleupon Z's ontology.

248
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,160
I mean, the mailbox is as real as it gets.

249
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:54,080
So, we might suppose that Merleau-Ponty would simply say that the mailbox in itself solicits us.

250
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:05,840
But that's not how he understands the richness of the thing, because he recognizes that our bodily existence in the world gives a certain kind of human character to all the perceived world.

251
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:10,719
We mesh with the world, as I put it, and the things in the world mesh with us.

252
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:13,680
We're kind of stuck together.

253
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:23,200
So, Merlot Ponzi makes a deliberately paradoxical claim about the thing, that a thing in the perceived world is a thing in itself for us.

254
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:34,959
So, the first time I read this a couple years ago, I remember scratching my head, like it was nobody's business, and I actually wrote a paper for Professor Dreyfus on some of this idealism-realism issue, and I got it all wrong, I think.

255
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,920
Well, I got it half right, half wrong, but hopefully, I think I've got it right now.

256
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,800
And it's just very confusing and puzzling.

257
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:50,759
But I think the centerpiece, at least to my interpretation of Roloffine, is to make a heck of a whole lot of a big deal out of this in-itself for us.

258
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:51,879
What the paradox is?

259
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,759
Oh, yeah, I'm going to quote the actual text, I think.

260
00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:56,360
Yeah, here it is.

261
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,080
I'm going to read it now.

262
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:01,160
It's on page 82 of, well, if my copy.

263
00:29:01,399 --> 00:29:02,360
71.

264
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,719
So yeah, we've actually already read this part of the text, I think, for last week's reading.

265
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:17,079
So it's the last paragraph of part one, the very last paragraph of the first chapter of part one, sorry, called experience and objective thought.

266
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:18,999
We must discover the origin.

267
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,080
That's how the line begins.

268
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:26,759
We must discover the origin of the objects at the very center of our experience.

269
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:35,000
We must describe the emergence of being, and we must understand how, paradoxically, there is for us an in itself.

270
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:50,040
So, you know, in light of my metaphysical interpretation of what's going on here, I think Werlochan He is trying hard to get rid of this entire dichotomy of a world in itself and a world for us.

271
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:57,799
So, part of his getting rid of this dichotomy is to say that there is this prejudice of the world.

272
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:02,200
There is no determinate world of parts for parts outside of parts in itself.

273
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,279
And so, then we're wondering, well, what does he believe?

274
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:06,920
Does he believe that everything is the world for us?

275
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:09,399
Well, there's a name for people who believe that.

276
00:30:09,399 --> 00:30:11,000
It's called idealism.

277
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,320
Now, what makes Kant's idealism different is that Kant really does believe that it's a thing in itself.

278
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:23,200
And he does believe that everything that we perceive is part of the will for us, is part of empirical reality.

279
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,560
So for Kant, but Kant goes, well, Kant goes a whole nine yards.

280
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:27,680
You really have to respect Kant.

281
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,359
Because Kant's going to say, well, even space and time are in the world for us.

282
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,880
And what scientists are doing is right here.

283
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:40,239
Scientists are not making claims about the thing in itself.

284
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:45,440
So, you know, Kant has a very powerful metaphysics, you know, transcendental idealism.

285
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:49,200
The problem is his understanding of the thing in itself seems incoherent.

286
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,440
I mean, one way of thinking of it is, well, the thing in itself is what God would see.

287
00:30:53,759 --> 00:31:02,560
So human understanding is stuck with the categories and forms of intuition, and that's the kind of world we have access to.

288
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:16,959
But we can also, there's also the world apart from our, at least we can, I mean, it's kind of incoherent almost, we can conceive of a world beyond the limitations of our possibilities for conceptual.

289
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:26,480
So the way Henry Allison puts it is, I guess other people, we can understand the thing in itself as the world from the God's eye view.

290
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:32,960
But in this case, the thing in itself as the world from the God's eye view is not the world of science.

291
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,960
Science is still here.

292
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:46,239
So in light of this historical problem, I'm trying to make sense of Merlot-Panzi's talk about the in-itself for us.

293
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:51,439
So now, you know, we'll have a concrete example from Berlot-Panzi.

294
00:31:51,439 --> 00:31:59,520
So whereas, it's kind of funny, you know, Heidegger's big example of solicitations and stuff like that is the ready-to-hand hammer.

295
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,000
And Kafka's example is a mailbox.

296
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,079
Berlot-Panzi's big example, which he kind of uses in his other books, is an ashtray.

297
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:13,319
I mean, I'm just, you know, I don't even want to know what he's smoking, but it's, he talks about it again and again, it's the ashtray.

298
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:14,759
Sorry, you have a question?

299
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,079
No, I haven't said what I really think he is.

300
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:23,160
I think he is a kind of transcendental idealist, but I haven't left that out and I haven't supported that at all.

301
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,359
But that could be.

302
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:31,239
Well, with Kant, it's kind of problematic in that there's a sense of being too objective looks.

303
00:32:31,239 --> 00:32:35,239
But to put it this way, what I actually think will come out later.

304
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:44,200
And so far as he's like Kant in that I think he's a kind of transcendental idealist, then perhaps there is a sense in which we could say Berlopanji is an empirical realist.

305
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,439
I mean, if that's what you would be getting at.

306
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:49,640
But I'll get to that later.

307
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,880
So here's the passage where Berlopanji talked about the ashtray.

308
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:59,320
It's on 372 in my book.

309
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,759
319.

310
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,079
319.

311
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,160
319 in the other book.

312
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:09,320
So it starts with a form of behavior.

313
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,520
It's the sentence before, the sentence with the a priori in italics, I think.

314
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:20,440
A form of behavior outlines a certain manner of treating the world.

315
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:30,200
In the same way, in the interactions of things, each one is characterized by a kind of a priori, to which it remains faithful in all its encounters with the outside world.

316
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,160
The significance of a thing inhabits a thing as the soul inhabits a body.

317
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,400
It is not behind appearances.

318
00:33:37,399 --> 00:33:51,000
The significance of the ashtray, at least its total and individual significance, as it is given in perception, is not a certain idea of an ashtray, which coordinates its sensory aspects and is accessible to the understanding alone.

319
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,360
It animates the ashtray and is self-evidently embodied in it.

320
00:33:56,239 --> 00:34:00,480
You know, that makes me want to light up right now and start using ashtrays.

321
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,800
But he goes on.

322
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:12,160
So given what he says about the ashtray and the thing in itself for us, we want to get to the bottom of his metaphysics and figure out whether he's an idealist or realist or whatever.

323
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:18,400
So the next passage where he mentions the thing in itself for us, he sounds pretty idealistic to me.

324
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:28,640
So it's a few pages after the one I just quoted on page 375 in the paragraph beginning, however, we have not yet exhausted the meaning of the thing.

325
00:34:29,439 --> 00:34:45,440
So 375 in my book, he writes, one cannot, as we have said, conceive any perceived thing without someone to perceive it.

326
00:34:45,759 --> 00:34:56,000
But the fact remains that the thing presents itself to the person who perceives it as a thing in itself, and thus poses the genuine problem of a thing in itself for us.

327
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,719
Now, we've already seen how Malo-Ponty is not a realist in the sense of a traditional naturalist.

328
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:12,800
He's also not a Barclayan idealist, because he thinks objects that are perceivable exist and that they have a fullness to their presence which includes their hidden sides, so to speak.

329
00:35:12,799 --> 00:35:17,680
But it's still an open question if he's a kind of transcendental idealist.

330
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:25,360
And I'm wondering if, like Kant, Malo-Ponty has in his metaphysics, the understanding of a non-human reality.

331
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,759
And I think, you know, and by that I mean a non-human reality that would correspond to Kant's idea of a thing in a dark world.

332
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,560
Yeah?

333
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:43,399
Well, I just think that we have to conceive of things that aren't perceptible, that we can't perceive, and so like atoms and quarks.

334
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,239
But we're claiming he's an idealist and the objective world does not exist.

335
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:48,439
So you're saying that.

336
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,719
Again, it's not, I'm not saying that the objective world doesn't exist.

337
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:55,160
I'm saying the objective world in itself.

338
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,600
For him, it's not that it doesn't exist, it's that it's inconceivable.

339
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,640
So that's his point.

340
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,999
So I don't agree with his point.

341
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,120
So the objective world thing itself does have to be conventional.

342
00:36:04,439 --> 00:36:07,239
I haven't told you my view yet because it's neither of the options presented.

343
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,839
Sorry, do you have a question back there?

344
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:16,920
We can share when we do what Milo Pante is doing, it may make it problematic to apply categories by realism idealism.

345
00:36:16,919 --> 00:36:19,080
Is there something really funny about it?

346
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:23,799
Being like, well, if we figure out whether Milo Pante is an idealist, then we'll understand the challenge.

347
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,359
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

348
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:25,560
Yeah, yeah.

349
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,080
I mean, it's kind of a chicken egg, but I can easily go the other way, too.

350
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:38,279
So, I mean, the point is, to support what I'm saying, I want to look at the text and try to show how he himself is working within these categories.

351
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:41,640
So we know that he is rejecting this.

352
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:48,759
And so if he's rejecting that, you know, what possible views are left up in the air?

353
00:36:48,759 --> 00:36:50,519
Well, that's exactly what I'm saying.

354
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:57,799
I mean, you might have a view that in challenging, you know, we set out that idealism idealism or whatever.

355
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,519
Yeah.

356
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,920
So to support what you're saying, actually, this is explicitly how he argues.

357
00:37:04,919 --> 00:37:13,799
So Milo-Ponte thinks that he's come up with a radical new ontology, which is beyond idealism and beyond realism.

358
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:19,000
So, there's a specific, actually, there are two specific passages I can think of off the top of my head where he says this.

359
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:32,640
Even though he says that, my point is, despite his intentions to achieve this view beyond idealism and realism, I think given what he actually said and what he actually believes, he's stuck.

360
00:37:33,279 --> 00:37:37,120
He's still stuck in this view in an incoherent way.

361
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,599
So, yes.

362
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,360
And not only you could, but you can because he's got it on the page.

363
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,799
So, I'll get to this later.

364
00:37:46,799 --> 00:37:55,759
The way in which he thinks he's beyond idealism and realism is his idea of being in the world, which he's just hijacking from Heidegger.

365
00:37:55,759 --> 00:38:02,719
This is very confusing because he actually doesn't have the same understanding of the world as Heidegger.

366
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:10,160
And so, part of my confusion in reading this text is I want to just kind of bring in Heidegger and fuse him with Lillopon T.

367
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:12,000
That's the natural thing to do.

368
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,360
That doesn't work.

369
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:24,959
I think ultimately, Heidegger has a much more coherent understanding of the world than Le Loopon T, an understanding of the world which makes sense of finance.

370
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,280
But also, it goes beyond this.

371
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,839
So, again, that's this alternative that I want to get at.

372
00:38:29,919 --> 00:38:30,719
Judgings?

373
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,039
I just want to be clear about what you're doing with this passage.

374
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:39,759
It says one cannot, as we have said, conceive any perceived thing, perceived thing, without someone to perceive it.

375
00:38:39,759 --> 00:38:41,600
It doesn't say we can't conceive anything.

376
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:42,239
Yeah, yeah.

377
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:46,640
I was just responding to his suggestion, which doesn't really have to do with that package before.

378
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,399
Well, okay, well, what do you want to make out of that?

379
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:57,279
So, I thought you were reading this as saying one cannot conceive anything without someone to perceive it.

380
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,159
But he doesn't say that.

381
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,000
Yeah, he doesn't say that there.

382
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,719
But you're right.

383
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:02,879
Is that what you think, the passage?

384
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:03,520
No.

385
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,319
So, moving on to Lillopine C and Khan.

386
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:14,200
So, I was just responding to that guy's question before, which was on a, which was on the problem of whether it is an objective world in itself and what I think.

387
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:17,559
And so it was kind of a this is happening again and again.

388
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,799
I mean, I want to distinguish my interpretation of Merleau-Ponty from what I actually think.

389
00:39:21,799 --> 00:39:26,280
And so I was asking, I was answering the question for what I actually think.

390
00:39:26,279 --> 00:39:26,920
Okay.

391
00:39:26,919 --> 00:39:29,560
So moving on to Merleopine C and Kant.

392
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:39,239
Okay, so I'm wondering if, like Kant, Malo-Ponte has in his metaphysics the understanding of a non-human reality, some kind of analog to Kant's thing in itself.

393
00:39:39,879 --> 00:39:44,520
So far, it seems that all of perceptible reality is the world for us.

394
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:49,239
And, you know, Merleponty calls this the in-itself for us.

395
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:51,320
But it's still a for us.

396
00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:58,040
So is it really still inconceivable to imagine a non-human world which is not for us, but just in itself?

397
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:02,120
Even if it's not the supposedly determinate world of science.

398
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:07,159
So couldn't there be an indeterminate world in itself?

399
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:14,919
So I think this is what Maloponty's philosophy commits him to in spite of his desire to admit it.

400
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:27,560
So I'm more than happy to admit that he's not going to, you know, he's trying to resist this kind of interpretation, but then he says things like he does on page 375.

401
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:31,719
So now I'm going to the bottom of the page that we were just on.

402
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:36,040
Ordinarily, I don't know what page is that in that.

403
00:40:36,279 --> 00:40:46,839
Ordinarily, we do not notice this because our perception in the context of our everyday concerns alights on things 322.

404
00:40:48,439 --> 00:40:50,840
So the sentence beginning ordinarily.

405
00:40:50,839 --> 00:41:09,839
So ordinarily, we do not notice this because our perception in the context of our everyday concerns alights on things sufficiently attentively to discover in them their familiar presence, but not sufficiently to disclose the non-human element which lies hidden in them.

406
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,560
Well, I'm wondering what in the world this could be.

407
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,520
You know, whatever it is, it's not the world for us.

408
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:22,960
It's this non-human element, and he has the prejudice of the world, so you would think it's not the world in itself.

409
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:30,079
Now, I think it's clear it's not the world in itself understood as a determinate world in itself.

410
00:41:30,399 --> 00:41:39,120
But I think, kind of like Kant, he's got this understanding of perhaps an indeterminate world in itself.

411
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:50,640
I mean, how do you make sense of us constituting figures or creating things on an indeterminate horizon if there isn't something there to begin with?

412
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,920
So I think it's still an open question whether there's an indeterminate something or other out there.

413
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:01,039
And that indeterminate something or other out there is not what science studies.

414
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,359
It's just this kind of mystery X.

415
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,120
And so, I mean, that's just a possible interpretation.

416
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:09,039
Now, I'm actually very cautious in saying that.

417
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,960
And I think it is possible that he's saying, he could be saying something else.

418
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:26,880
But the main thing I want to emphasize is that whatever he's saying, insofar as it has, insofar as what he's saying is a rejection of the prejudice of the world, it's going to run into some serious problem.

419
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:39,400
I mean, I'm assuming you would think that too, assuming you disagree with his understanding of the possibility of the existence of an objective determinate world in itself.

420
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:48,280
Okay, so now I'm going to actually get to want to talk about the alternative understanding of the world.

421
00:42:48,279 --> 00:42:51,959
And I think the clearest way of expressing that is J.J.

422
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,319
Gibson's own thoughts.

423
00:42:53,319 --> 00:42:54,200
So I think J.J.

424
00:42:54,200 --> 00:43:01,080
Gibson actually succeeds in getting beyond this kind of what I call world dualism.

425
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,479
The distinction between a world in itself and a world for us.

426
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,759
So any questions before I go on?

427
00:43:04,759 --> 00:43:05,560
Yeah, for Ken.

428
00:43:06,919 --> 00:43:10,439
He himself, I mean, I'll talk to you himself or not.

429
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:27,880
Just to clarify things, are you talking about his notion of that, you know, where things eventually progress toward our seeing it as a determinant object and we've taken it as something that's yeah, like this piece of talk is a thing in itself for us.

430
00:43:27,879 --> 00:43:32,920
Part of the richness of the talk is that it still solicits me to ride on the board.

431
00:43:32,919 --> 00:43:41,239
And so we can only understand the talk as being what it is insofar as we understand it as fitting in our kind of human world.

432
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:43,719
And this is as real as real gets.

433
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,319
I don't know if that answers your question.

434
00:43:46,439 --> 00:43:49,719
Or do you think that's where there's this progression on the terminal?

435
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,560
Is that what you're trying to capture?

436
00:43:53,799 --> 00:43:56,680
No, I think he's just trying to capture that.

437
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:01,799
Well, I feel like I will just repeat myself, that the this is as real as things get.

438
00:44:01,799 --> 00:44:08,680
So in that thing, it's in itself and not in my mind or for us.

439
00:44:08,759 --> 00:44:19,319
On the other hand, it's for us in that part of it being what it is is met in the world we live in, the kind of human world.

440
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:24,719
Now, if you talked about the answer, you speaker about the physical world, the ethical world in the human world is.

441
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,959
Yeah, yeah.

442
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,160
So, did you say for us being okay?

443
00:44:29,439 --> 00:44:30,239
Yeah, good question.

444
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:32,640
We'll get to that here with quick use.

445
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:52,480
Ultimately, I think Melopon T's view, not Gibson's, or mine, Loopon T's view is that we need to understand that when we understand like Freeman's rabbits hopping around, we're understanding it for the rabbit, you know, the relation of the character of the carrot to the rabbit who's hungry.

446
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,680
But in doing that, we are perceiving that event.

447
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,000
And so that's, so there's a tricky sense in which that's still part of the world.

448
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,640
Yeah, okay, but when the rabbit smells a carrot, and you speak about the care for the rabbit.

449
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,360
Yes.

450
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:15,439
All of that is happening just the way we're talking about it now in our human terms.

451
00:45:15,759 --> 00:45:16,400
Yeah.

452
00:45:16,399 --> 00:45:23,519
But at least we're, but that's still an important break from the kind of reflex theory or, you know.

453
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:34,399
So I guess what you're all okay, so now I'm just going to go ahead and present this alternative understanding of the world, which I think is what J.J.

454
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:35,200
Gibson has.

455
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,479
So what's interesting about J.J.

456
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:52,480
Gibson is that even though it's tempting to read him as being, and he is very similar to Lelofine T and Heidegger, I think LeLopine T is a heck of a lot closer to Heidegger and much more different to Lerlofine T.

457
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:57,039
So the big concept in J.J.

458
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,200
Gibson that I'll talk about is the management of an affordance.

459
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:10,280
An affordance is basically like a solicitation, like the ashtray, and the demand character of the mailbox.

460
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,120
The real difference here is a metaphysical one.

461
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:14,999
For J.J.

462
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:22,359
Gibson, the affordance is a real feature of the object.

463
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:24,759
It's not something that depends on us.

464
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:32,120
So, you know, Milo-Ponte wants to tag on this for us at the end of his understanding of a thing.

465
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,160
J.J.

466
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:47,239
Gibson is going to have, well, at the same time, more radical, but I think it's a more down-to-earth understanding of the metaphysics of solicitations, demand characters, affordances.

467
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:52,999
So a classic example of an affordance, I mean, other than aspirations and stuff like that, would be a chair.

468
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,999
So the chair has the property of being sit-onable.

469
00:46:57,239 --> 00:46:58,120
Right.

470
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,040
Yes, it is important.

471
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:09,559
And so the, and just like the, you know, things show up as being eatable, you know, you're eatable to a tiger.

472
00:47:10,439 --> 00:47:19,400
And so that just shows that we need to distinguish between the eatable items for tigers and the eatable items for people and the sit-onable items for people.

473
00:47:19,399 --> 00:47:27,799
And also you have a problem of, you know, people with age with disabilities who don't think we're people right there for us.

474
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:32,520
It's not for us because it's a feature of the object.

475
00:47:32,839 --> 00:47:39,719
A feature of the object which does relate to us, but it doesn't actually depend on our, I guess you could say, factively being there.

476
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:44,279
So let me quote what Gibson says to see if it clarifies it, because if this is the right question.

477
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:50,519
So this is actually for, if you're interested, pages 138 to 139 of J.J.

478
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,840
Gibson's ecological approach to visual perception.

479
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:54,799
138.

480
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:58,160
And there he actually explicitly disagrees with Kafka.

481
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:03,120
So it's very interesting how he just kind of repeats what I was saying.

482
00:48:03,439 --> 00:48:10,159
The concept of affordance is derived from these concepts of valence, invitation, and demand, but with a crucial difference.

483
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:16,239
So here's the difference between at least Rolo-Pinski and, I'm sorry, Gibson and the Gestalt psychologist.

484
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:21,920
The affordance of something does not change as the need of the observer changes.

485
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:29,600
The observer may or may not perceive or attend to the affordance according to his needs.

486
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:34,719
But the affordance, being invariant, is always there to be perceived.

487
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:38,239
An affordance is not bestowed upon an object.

488
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:41,519
That's the exact word that Kafka used instantly, bestowed.

489
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:46,160
Yeah, an affordance is not bestowed upon an object by a need of an observer.

490
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:54,160
And his act of perceiving it, the object offers what it does because it is what it is.

491
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:59,120
I mean, that's a deep metaphysical point he's making about what the object is.

492
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:03,120
Not what it is in itself, not what it is for us.

493
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,280
Just part of the richness of what it is.

494
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:08,719
This sucker here affords writing on the board.

495
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:12,719
Now, it could be Martians come down who did not invent the chalk.

496
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:20,639
We don't know anything about our chalk practices, but suppose they write with stuff, and they just kind of figure out this is something that you can write with.

497
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,359
It's true.

498
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:26,559
It's a fact about this piece of chalk, that it's right-withable, you could say.

499
00:49:26,879 --> 00:49:34,800
Now, there are some things like food, which perhaps there's only one kind of animal which can eat a certain kind of food.

500
00:49:34,799 --> 00:49:37,200
But the metaphysical point is this is a feature of the object.

501
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:54,919
And again, all I want to highlight for now, you know, isn't whether you believe this or not, but how this is a different way of understanding the phenomenology of perception with a metaphysics which is consistent with the phenomenology, but distinct from the metaphysics that J.J.

502
00:49:54,919 --> 00:49:56,280
Gibson has.

503
00:49:56,279 --> 00:50:01,239
So this is really the main thing that I want to say, kind of the take-home message.

504
00:50:01,879 --> 00:50:05,400
Don't confuse the metaphysics of this book with the phenomenology.

505
00:50:05,399 --> 00:50:11,960
Don't feel like you have to buy into the metaphysics if you also buy into the phenomenology.

506
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:21,399
All I'm saying is that the phenomenology of this book is consistent with a radically different kind of metaphysics from the one Merlopine T explicitly gives us.

507
00:50:21,399 --> 00:50:30,360
And I think that metaphysics is along the lines of what Gibson, Heidegger, and on my reading McDowell says, although the McDowell case is tricky when it comes to perception.

508
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:46,600
But the basic point of an affordance we can clarify with an anthrax for the chair affords sitting, but when I'm walking past the chair to get out of the room, the chair presents itself as an obstacle.

509
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:53,960
Now in that case, I don't have access to the chair, I don't have access to the chair's sit-on ability.

510
00:50:54,279 --> 00:51:00,520
But just because I don't have access to the chair's sit-on ability doesn't mean that the chair is not sit-onable.

511
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:05,880
It doesn't mean that the sit-on ability of the chair just is in my mind.

512
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:12,920
I mean, that's not, you know, it's not, we're not forced to the conclusion that the sit-on ability of the chair is subjective.

513
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:19,719
Now, I think there's a there are a lot of natural objections to race to raise to this view.

514
00:51:19,719 --> 00:51:23,439
And I think there are all kinds of responses that can be made to these objections.

515
00:51:23,759 --> 00:51:35,120
But rather than getting into the nitty-gritty back and forth objections and arguments on that, I just want to emphasize that this is just a different way of understanding the phenomenology of perception.

516
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:41,680
A different way of understanding the phenomenology of perception that has a different underlying metaphysics.

517
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:50,880
So now the actually before getting to being in the world, I need to clarify this understanding of reality that Gibson has.

518
00:51:50,879 --> 00:51:57,999
I don't know what probably increases the number of questions that you have, but I think I just want to present it as an alternative.

519
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,160
It's original.

520
00:52:00,799 --> 00:52:13,120
So instead of having these three verticals of the world in itself and the world for us, Gibson makes the distinction between the environment and what he calls the physical world.

521
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:16,959
So while thinking of how I could draw Gibson, here's how I draw it.

522
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:21,759
If we take this to be, so Gibson has a level to description story.

523
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:30,080
Kind of the late 20th century philosophy, a lot of people have different understandings of levels of description, so it shouldn't be all that new to you.

524
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:35,120
The way Gibson understands it is that there are all kinds of different levels of description.

525
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,520
This is how he begins his book.

526
00:52:38,399 --> 00:52:46,719
So we can take this to be the level the level of descript the level of description of physics.

527
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,640
And this would be the level of description of chemistry.

528
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,360
And this is the level of description of biology.

529
00:52:53,359 --> 00:53:01,759
This up here is a whole new level of description that Gibson thinks he discovered and calls this the ecological level.

530
00:53:01,759 --> 00:53:07,200
So that's why this book is called the Ecological Approach to Visual Perception.

531
00:53:07,719 --> 00:53:20,520
The ecological, so just as the level of description of physics contains certain physical particles like atoms and quarks, the chemical level description contains molecules, I guess.

532
00:53:20,759 --> 00:53:25,480
The biological level description contains stuff like I guess cells or whatever.

533
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:35,320
The ecological level description contains drinkable water, walk on a little sidewalk, sit on a little chairs, and all that.

534
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:44,040
Now here, what's important to distinguish, which was motivating Professor Gregis' question, is that we need to distinguish between the different animals.

535
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,880
Because what's edible for humans is inedible for other animals.

536
00:53:48,200 --> 00:54:04,359
So even though there is a kind of referentiality or relationality to the very concept of an affordance, we're not denying that there is this relationality to affordances.

537
00:54:04,359 --> 00:54:06,280
I mean, that's the essence of the concept.

538
00:54:06,279 --> 00:54:13,719
The point is, the referentiality of an affordance is not to be understood as being objective or subjective.

539
00:54:13,719 --> 00:54:19,479
And when it comes to describing the different animals, yes, I think each animal has what J.J.

540
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,440
Gibson calls an environment.

541
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:37,239
So since, you know, to use a little confused terms, just as we mesh with the perceived world, you know, we mesh with the chalk, and the chalk, as we experience the chalk, meshes with us, J.J.

542
00:54:37,239 --> 00:54:43,320
Gibson's going to call that the mutuality between an organism and an environment.

543
00:54:43,319 --> 00:54:47,400
This is actually explicitly how he begins chapter one of his book.

544
00:54:47,399 --> 00:54:55,759
And it's great that he does that because I think what he's doing is articulating high-gger's understanding of the kind of cosmological mutuality.

545
00:54:55,919 --> 00:55:05,360
And so that's really just another way of saying we're not to understand ourselves as being subject as opposed to objects and the traditional subject topic distinction.

546
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:07,999
We're just supposed to understand ourselves as being moral.

547
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,719
And we should understand animals as being in an animal environment.

548
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:29,040
So to take the classic example of a bat, we need to describe, if we want to understand the bat, we need to describe the kinds of things in the bat environment which attracts and repulse bats.

549
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:35,360
The kinds of objects and properties to which the bat has access.

550
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:37,759
You know, given its sonar and whatnot.

551
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:41,359
So if you want to know what's it like to be a bat, I think if you're J.J.

552
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:45,359
Gibson, your answer to that question is, you know, look at what attracts and repels bats.

553
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:49,440
Look at the things that show up to bats as edible.

554
00:55:49,439 --> 00:55:50,400
Show up.

555
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:54,000
Show up that the bat has access to.

556
00:55:54,399 --> 00:55:55,999
Perspective access to.

557
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:56,319
Yeah?

558
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:59,279
Is this a multiple individual life is congruent?

559
00:55:59,279 --> 00:56:09,839
Because an individual details all the algorithms itself to the people are taller and shorter than others.

560
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:15,280
So I mean, you know, for what it's worth, a basketball group is not dunk onable.

561
00:56:15,279 --> 00:56:22,799
Like, you know, well, when I'm kind of trading and driving the lane on a fast break, I don't think maybe now would be a good time to dunk.

562
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:25,679
You know, it doesn't, the basketball group doesn't show up that way.

563
00:56:25,919 --> 00:56:32,320
It doesn't afford dunking, you know, given people from my perspective and stuff.

564
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:52,439
And so that's also an important part of understanding the understanding of an affordance in that we need to think of it in terms of possible perceivers, you know, possible organisms, as if they were standing here with, you know, as tall as I am with my physical capabilities in that room.

565
00:56:52,439 --> 00:56:56,920
But it's still not in my mind subjective.

566
00:56:56,919 --> 00:57:01,879
And it's still not objective in the sense that it's not a part of the world of physics.

567
00:57:01,879 --> 00:57:05,560
Like, you're not going to find affordances with your microscopes.

568
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:11,239
You're doing the research in the wrong library if you think you're going to find an affordance there, there, or there.

569
00:57:11,879 --> 00:57:21,560
So the metaphysical problem is there's a general bias in philosophy and science that if something doesn't exist at this level, then it just doesn't exist.

570
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,319
I mean, some people have gone that route.

571
00:57:23,319 --> 00:57:26,920
So if you can't find colors here, there are no colors.

572
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:35,480
Now, of course, there are sophisticated philosophers and scientists who will try to make room for colors being here, like a dispositional account and stuff.

573
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:40,439
But this is just a genuine alternative that I want to present.

574
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:43,960
Ah, good.

575
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:44,599
Good.

576
00:57:45,239 --> 00:58:00,200
Well, what's very interesting about that question is what looks like a serious objection to the very idea of being in the world is the way in which Malofine C himself introduces the idea of being in the world of the phantasm.

577
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:14,040
So I do think that phantom wings, illusions, dreams, sinus studied experiences are all the most serious problems, the most serious objections for making sense of this alternative I'm presenting.

578
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:25,519
One question is: even if you can't handle these objections all that great, are the alternatives like that, in other words, who can give you a really good account of phantom limbs and stuff?

579
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:33,200
But if those people can give you a good account of phantom limbs, kind of the catch-winning view, then they give you a good account of other stuff, like ordinary reflections.

580
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:38,879
So I do think these are the biggest things that were a problem for you.

581
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:39,439
Phantom limbs.

582
00:58:41,919 --> 00:58:42,960
Okay, good, yeah.

583
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,640
Yeah, thanks, Jay.

584
00:58:44,879 --> 00:58:54,160
So phantom limbs would be a problem for this view, and illusions and hallucinations, because this view is basically a form of direct realism.

585
00:58:55,120 --> 00:59:04,239
And the normal way of explaining illusions and hallucinations is to say that, well, the phantom limb is just in your mind.

586
00:59:04,879 --> 00:59:11,440
Because obviously there is no limb there, but you're still experiencing the pain in your phantom limb.

587
00:59:11,439 --> 00:59:15,680
So, you know, the natural question asked is, well, where's the pain if it's not in your mind?

588
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:17,920
Not in your mind and it's not in the world.

589
00:59:17,919 --> 00:59:27,920
So when Taylor Carmen came here last year to talk about Holo Pine C, I raised my hand because he mentioned phantom limbs and I said, where's the pain of my phantom limb?

590
00:59:27,919 --> 00:59:31,039
And it's kind of not very nice of me to ask because I know he can't answer it.

591
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,479
So I just wanted to see what he would say.

592
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:35,920
I think he just gave an honest answer, which is that I don't really know.

593
00:59:35,919 --> 00:59:46,960
But I think, well, in light of this, I'm kind of curious to reread what Model Pine C says about being in the world in Phantom Limbs.

594
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:56,480
But I do think that this is a serious problem, hallucinations and illusions and phantom limbs for this direct realist view.

595
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:01,279
But I also think the the alternatives, I mean, there are problems for all the alternative metaphysical views.

596
01:00:01,279 --> 01:00:04,160
And I would rather be saddled with these problems than the alternatives.

597
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,839
But I mean, what I think doesn't really matter.

598
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:09,960
This is an important objection.

599
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:10,999
Yeah?

600
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:21,560
Getting back to affordances, talk affordance writability, regardless of whether I'm a human being or what is the basketball food.

601
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:26,680
Well, the question amounts to: well, what is dunkability?

602
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,840
You know, what is the importance of dunkability?

603
01:00:28,839 --> 01:00:35,719
What else goes into a basketball group being dunk onable?

604
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:39,320
And I think just the concept of an affordance is very rich.

605
01:00:39,319 --> 01:00:56,759
And you have to get into, well, in the case of it really being a slay-and-dunk and not just a physical action, in other words, for it to be a slam dunk as being worth two points in a game of basketball, you need to bring in something like, well, what's real called collective intentionality.

606
01:00:56,759 --> 01:00:59,879
And you need to get into, well, you don't need that.

607
01:00:59,879 --> 01:01:02,759
You just need to get into institutions and premises.

608
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:11,239
So what I haven't mentioned yet, which is worth emphasizing, is that there is a sense in which we're distinct from the animals.

609
01:01:11,239 --> 01:01:14,999
And there's a sense in which the world we live in is a rich cultural world.

610
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,640
We have history and tradition and language.

611
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:31,559
And so in that sense, you've got more, as Heidegger understands, Heidegger's going to understand all this stuff for animals to be Boomfeld environment or surrounding world.

612
01:01:31,879 --> 01:01:36,999
And then Heidegger's going to understand all of this to be the present at the end.

613
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,559
And so I mean, while I'm here, I mean, so this is my understanding of Heidegger.

614
01:01:41,559 --> 01:01:50,439
And what's important is that this understanding of Heidegger succeeds at getting beyond the world-in-itself, world-for-us dichotomy.

615
01:01:50,439 --> 01:01:57,120
And the way it avoids that world-in-itself, world-for-us dichotomy is by having those kind of levels of description.

616
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:16,960
But I guess ultimately, the problem of an affordance of predemponability, I mean, I just think if you read the way Gibson describes affordances, yes, you do have to take into account my particular body, but really, really just the possible particular bodies that could possibly dunk a bathroom.

617
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,120
Say, why don't you take into account group?

618
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:29,919
I do take into account my particular need to write or not write insofar as that is an essential part of my having access to the affordance.

619
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:35,519
But just because I don't always have access to an affordance doesn't mean that the affordance isn't already there.

620
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:42,319
So, I mean, that's the main difference between Gibson's understanding of it and somebody like, I guess, Dave Morobox here.

621
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:48,799
And this is puzzling, and I sympathize and I encourage people to object with everything I've said in the last 10 minutes.

622
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:53,359
And I'm just trying to go back to contrasting this with the geostalpus.

623
01:02:53,359 --> 01:03:02,719
So, an apple for Gibson that doesn't say eat me, it says if it still looks edible, even when I'm not hungry.

624
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:03,359
That's the difference.

625
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:04,319
Ah, exactly.

626
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:10,880
I think, well, using the metaphor, you can't just simply say that the apples have eaten me, you just don't always hear it.

627
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,319
Oh, okay.

628
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,759
Or rather, around you, you hear it but ignore it.

629
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,279
I mean, I guess there are different ways of thinking of it.

630
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:25,679
It looks like it looks atedible, but if you're hungry, you're attuned to that and have access for that.

631
01:03:25,679 --> 01:03:26,160
Yeah.

632
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,040
And it doesn't even look edible again.

633
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:29,359
I don't know.

634
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,599
I mean, it is why would you look?

635
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:34,559
Well, I could walk by the garbage came here and it might be a happy apple.

636
01:03:34,639 --> 01:03:38,679
Technically, if I were a starving person, you know, I'd be looking.

637
01:03:38,679 --> 01:03:39,960
So I'm just walking off the roof.

638
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:43,399
So okay, I'll satisfy that person.

639
01:03:46,279 --> 01:03:47,639
Everything can be affordable.

640
01:03:48,359 --> 01:03:53,479
The Martian I came down, you may not have to write with anything.

641
01:03:54,279 --> 01:03:55,720
What is write with the whole thing?

642
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:57,800
Right, you may not even have a concept of writing.

643
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,439
You may never need to write anything to this point.

644
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:04,279
And yet you're still seeming to say that the chalk don't have its green.

645
01:04:04,599 --> 01:04:05,719
It still affords writing, yeah.

646
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:07,000
It's just still afforded writing.

647
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,519
And so it seems that everything can afford anything.

648
01:04:10,599 --> 01:04:11,319
Depends upon the.

649
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:13,319
Well, not anything can afford anything.

650
01:04:13,319 --> 01:04:17,000
But what you're suggesting is what I freely admit, the world is rich.

651
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,799
Well, what about the Martian likes to be metal?

652
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,800
You know, so it comes down and eats the biochemistry.

653
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:29,959
Yes, that's just part of the peculiarity of the eatability or edibleness of metal.

654
01:04:30,279 --> 01:04:35,959
So what I like about the way you're thinking is this is exactly how I want to criticize Thomas Nagel.

655
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:42,599
Nagel is very interesting because he recognizes that there's something fundamentally problematic with the subject-object distinction.

656
01:04:42,599 --> 01:04:52,040
But his solution isn't to get rid of it, but to say that the subject-object distinction is a difference in degree, and that we have to think of it as tendencies or directions of our knowledge.

657
01:04:52,040 --> 01:05:07,559
And the way he argues for it is with Martians and stuff like that, and you know, what does it like to be a bat on the one hand, but you need to understand the what does it like to be a bat argument in light of what Nagel says about Martian scientists trying to understand us.

658
01:05:07,559 --> 01:05:30,639
So, whereas if we take here into account the different kinds of organisms and levels of description for the different species and stuff, and include Martians, Thomas Nagel's subjectivity, objectivity story is going to be kind of this directional way, where it depends on your point of view.

659
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:42,879
So, his book is The View from Nowhere, where The View from Nowhere is kind of the rock-bottom asymptotic view that we get in doing natural science like physics.

660
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:49,599
And so, what I really think is a very fruitful way to think of this in contrast to it.

661
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:55,679
Because, I mean, why not just, my response to Nabel is why not just get rid of the subject-object distinction itself?

662
01:05:55,679 --> 01:05:57,759
I mean, he wants to turn it into a matter of degree.

663
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:05,040
So, I mean, my way of thinking of it is really, we're either stuck with world in itself or for us, and one of its variations.

664
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:07,839
Or we just have to get rid of the whole thing.

665
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:13,120
Now, it would be nice if Milo Fine C were saying, but I don't think he is.

666
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:19,439
I think despite his intentions, he's still stuck in a kind of perverted rejection.

667
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:23,040
In rejecting the world in itself, he's still kind of hungry.

668
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:28,639
But that said, you will read at least two passages where he says that he's going beyond idealism and realism.

669
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:31,120
He is the barker that is being in the world.

670
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,519
And I don't think he's succeeding at them.

671
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:42,479
We make sure that we hold up this thing that Niggy belongs to the point of the left there.

672
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:43,679
That's mine.

673
01:06:45,519 --> 01:06:46,160
Oh, good.

674
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:53,920
And you understand this brief is going to give a gender perception.

675
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,599
You know which one is where they all have.

676
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,679
Somebody tell me what room where I should do.

677
01:06:58,479 --> 01:06:59,759
Well, let me uh write this down.

678
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:03,160
When and where when and where?

679
01:07:05,639 --> 01:07:09,080
Oh, I think it's 11 in one night.

680
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:10,920
Tomorrow?

681
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:15,239
I don't know if you had a chance to read McDowell's two sorts of natural requirements.

682
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:20,519
But there he explicitly talks about this this getting beyond the in-itself or at the function.
