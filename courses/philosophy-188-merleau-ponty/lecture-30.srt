00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:15,481
So so ex I I would like to to find out if if brain science uh can can can shed some light on what's going on in this in this very brief episode uh where we move away in the elevator to the right distance now I focus on a few aspects within neuroscience a few perspectives the neural basis of skills utilization behaviour performance monitoring actually I've been mentioning this all before so I won't go through the list again very briefly there's a whole body of literature on the neural basis of skills sometimes it goes on the name of procedural memory or system memory the most important thing to know is that there is a widely distributed network of brain activity involved in executing a skill and from neuroscience it becomes quite clear which areas of the brain are particularly involved in this type of skillful motor action.

2
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,201
I've written down the most important areas, I won't go through the list now.

3
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:42,761
One question that isn't answered by these people working on the neural basis of skills is how all these deep areas that show up in imaging or in lesion studies, how actually this the activity of all these areas is being coordinated for the realization of some tasks.

4
00:01:42,760 --> 00:02:02,001
And in order to understand how that may be the case, it's useful to study the literature on self-organization and functional integration or neurodynamics, where they do have a story about how functional integration can occur.

5
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:18,241
And one of the most important hypothesis at the moment is that it's translated global phase synchronization that makes it possible for areas to be integrated and to generate behavior at the global level.

6
00:02:19,841 --> 00:02:36,881
So far for the skills, now I will pay attention to utilization behavior, but starting from first there's some parts or some descriptions from Melo Ponty about know-how and what we could call affordances.

7
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:51,441
So as you all know he describes some concrete situations of know-how like the woman with the feather on her head making sure that it doesn't break or the people in the desert immediately knowing where to go when they want to go home.

8
00:02:53,841 --> 00:03:00,241
When you look for it you find something somewhere in phenomenology of behavior of perception.

9
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:11,441
Often it's important that this type of action occurs freely rapidly and it doesn't come from nowhere.

10
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:19,840
The body unifies many capacities, capacities attuned to certain parts of the world, you can say.

11
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:31,040
There is a direct link between the organism's capacities and what I perceive the possibilities for action in the environment.

12
00:03:33,121 --> 00:03:40,080
However, one of the limitations, as you know, is that Melo-Ponty's descriptions leave some some quite some mystery.

13
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:45,800
Sometimes he speaks about how metric a real is.

14
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:58,520
Neuroscience doesn't, of course, immediately shed light on this, but indirectly I think it helps to get a better feeling for what's going on.

15
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:05,961
So what would be accordances in Mel Ponty's pre-Gibsonian descriptions?

16
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:21,961
The subject, I put here the craftsman, but actually it's about Snyder, but in this situation, I think Meloponty is also trying to describe a normal concrete feeling with the world.

17
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,680
So I put there the craftsman or it should be the wallet nail, each wallet maker.

18
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:37,880
When put in front of his status needle and familiar tasks, he doesn't need to look for his hands or his fingers because they are potentialities already mobilized by the perception of scissors or needle.

19
00:04:37,881 --> 00:04:49,241
The central end of those intentional threats which link him to the object given is the piece of leather to be cut up, it's a lining to be stood.

20
00:04:50,201 --> 00:05:01,800
Now another place is Meloton T often stresses that in familiar environments we do not deliberate with reactive movements, a possibility for action.

21
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:10,360
Or as he said, if the body starts towards objects to be grasped, objects speak to the body subject, objects invite our reactions.

22
00:05:10,681 --> 00:05:17,000
Objects are already look attractive or repulsive before you perceive your objective qualities.

23
00:05:17,641 --> 00:05:22,040
He speaks of being called by a situation if you do some work.

24
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:40,961
One way I like to think of the portion rule is as an integrated system where the open situation can ask for some kind of work and elicit the necessary movement by some sort of remote retraction as an electromagnet.

25
00:05:42,481 --> 00:05:51,840
So from other competitive descriptions, it's quite clear that familiar objects do not even feel cold but move you or do something with you.

26
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,441
Then there is this pathology called utilization behavior.

27
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:04,000
It was described in the 1980s by Lamit, a neurologist from Perl.

28
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:19,520
His patients had patients with utilization behavior in general have acquired labial fungal lesion, but it is part of the brain.

29
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:24,640
Often acquired after a stroke, that can also be other causes.

30
00:06:25,201 --> 00:06:33,280
These patients tend to grasp and use objects, familiar objects, when they see them.

31
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,121
So I could grasp and use this thing.

32
00:06:39,121 --> 00:06:41,841
Yeah, that's playing with it, but it's not familiar for me.

33
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:50,641
But a patient may be attracted by this type of object if it is familiar to him.

34
00:06:51,121 --> 00:06:55,120
They even use it when they are told not to do it.

35
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:02,560
And it's important that they disregard part of the situational context.

36
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,600
I'll come back to that later.

37
00:07:06,161 --> 00:07:11,120
Finally, about the pathology, it's a trenching pathology.

38
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:35,641
If they recover, because often of course they don't and they die, but if they recover it's transient and it occurs after a period of akinetic mutism, which basically means that they are without initiative and don't speak their mood, being without initiative.

39
00:07:37,481 --> 00:07:42,680
Characteristics of utilization, it occurs spontaneously.

40
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:47,241
These patients disregard personal concerns.

41
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:56,280
So with personal concerns or also situational concerns, I mean their needs or interests or preferences.

42
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,280
They also disregard social context or social norms.

43
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:06,600
And the behavior is normally instrumentally correct.

44
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,241
So here you see a picture of one of the next patients.

45
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,641
One example would be a patient seeing a pair of glasses laying on the table, putting it on.

46
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:21,241
Well, nothing is wrong with his eyes.

47
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:24,600
Then he's disregarding his personal concerns.

48
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:30,441
Another thing that can go wrong is grasping the pair of glasses from the experimenter.

49
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:33,000
That would be disregarding social context.

50
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:50,840
And something that often also occurs is in this case, they keep on using so here the patient puts on two pairs of glasses, which is also again disregarding personal concerns because one pair of glasses should be another.

51
00:08:51,401 --> 00:08:58,201
Note that instrumentally correct Euroce means that the movement is fluent and technically adequate.

52
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:07,120
It doesn't put the glasses on the top of his head or on his shoulder or try to put it on upside down or just scratch the pair of glasses.

53
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:15,040
It's a normal movement and such a movement is often in neuroscience called a complex movement.

54
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:18,400
It's called a rectified sequence.

55
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:30,560
So examples of eucalyptizing behavior would be taking pen and paper to write when they are laid down in the room where you are.

56
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:41,840
Eating from an apple, like these patients are often tested while doing neuropsychological, other neuropsychological tests.

57
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:56,560
And then there may be all kinds of objects in the room and one of them may be the experiment with apple and the patient can grasp and use this apple eat it.

58
00:09:57,201 --> 00:10:04,081
Another old example is the patient being in the house of Lamit.

59
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:12,800
The neurologist being shown to the house on the writing in the bathroom sees the shaper and uses it.

60
00:10:13,121 --> 00:10:23,920
Another example from the same case is the patient starting to undress well on seeing a bed, but not his own death.

61
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:34,640
And it could also be that that patient takes the first means of transportation instead of the one that goes to the right direction.

62
00:10:34,641 --> 00:10:41,360
So, to summarize the main characteristics, behavior is instrumentally adequate, personally and socially inadequate.

63
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,241
It's called a rective complex action sequence.

64
00:10:44,441 --> 00:10:53,560
It's triggered by objects in the environment, triggered when they perceive it, when they perceive the object.

65
00:10:53,560 --> 00:11:01,881
Their lived experience is that the object orders the patient to use it.

66
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:08,680
And importantly, they are not aware of the inappropriateness of what they are doing.

67
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:20,360
And of course, we are not so much surprised that they don't have an explicit intention before they act because we don't have an explicit intention before we sit down in a chair either.

68
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:29,080
But for neuroscientists, I like to remember that it's not so strange that there's no intention beforehand.

69
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:37,640
So, what we can learn from utilization behavior is that familiar objects have some impact on this at the subpersonal level.

70
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:44,920
There may be a link with miracle-piece descriptions of object affectiveness.

71
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:55,000
Moreover, our everyday behavior is very well attuned to the complexities of the context.

72
00:11:55,641 --> 00:12:02,200
And there is a medial frontal system in the brain that seems to contribute to this attorney.

73
00:12:03,161 --> 00:12:06,201
Then, something about the lesions.

74
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:15,400
Now, if you're not interested in neuroscience, then you may forget the areas, but for the people that are, I do want to mention it.

75
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:33,441
The most common lesions of utilization behavior are generally bilateral lesions of the medial control cortex, ACC, pre-SMA, SMA, and often also it's connected to cortical structures like Cardassinucleus.

76
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,080
And two cases are known of anterior and medial euclid.

77
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,400
Here, a picture of the medial frontal lobe.

78
00:12:44,401 --> 00:12:47,681
So you look at, imagine the brain is scratched like this.

79
00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:53,040
You look at the medial side, at one of the sides.

80
00:12:54,641 --> 00:13:12,961
Then, I don't have a pointer, but when you see all the dots in the right picture there, that's the part of the grain that often gets damaged in patients with utilization behavior.

81
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:22,721
The areas there are the pre-SMA and the anterior singlet, the dorsal part of the anterior singlet.

82
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:39,840
Another word for the area that comes back later in the presentation is muscle singlet zone, RCZ, that means the red part in the top left picture.

83
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:47,520
Again, it overlaps ACC, dorsal ACC, and pre-SMA.

84
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:56,320
Remember also that these areas, this is a picture of areas involved in performance monitoring.

85
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:04,800
And the same regions that are lesions with utilization behavior are also lesions.

86
00:14:05,121 --> 00:14:12,961
No, the regions that are lesions by patiagnosis with utilization behavior are the same regions that are normally involved in uh performance monitoring.

87
00:14:12,921 --> 00:14:20,840
Okay, so there is a new basis of performance monitoring where you where you see all the all the dots.

88
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:31,000
Uh these are um uh studies that um that investigated performance monitoring for aspect of performance monitoring.

89
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:33,400
Don't mention there are there.

90
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:44,841
Um these um these studies point out that uh uh an important part of the brain for performance monitoring is this this region.

91
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,561
So each one of the stars is somebody's region.

92
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,800
Now is one study on performance monitoring.

93
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:57,000
Yeah, so it's uh it's a a review of many articles uh that study performance monitoring.

94
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,721
And I just use this picture for utilization data to show which part of the brain is involved there.

95
00:15:03,721 --> 00:15:15,721
And moreover, because later on I will be talking about performance monitoring in the sustainable mode of the brain for hostile singlets on ACP.

96
00:15:16,921 --> 00:15:31,320
But at the moment the the latest articles on utilization behavior they they tend to focus or think out of a different frame of thinking.

97
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:44,760
This is a model by Gary Goldberg from 1985 where two systems are being distinguished, the medial premotor system and the lateral premotor system.

98
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:56,120
The green lines here point to areas of the lateral premotor system and the red lines areas of the medial premotor system.

99
00:15:57,401 --> 00:16:03,201
One area of the media with medial premotor system which is not clear is the ACC.

100
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,360
And also the distinction between SMA and pre-SMA wasn't made at that time.

101
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:34,961
The hypothesis of the people working on utilization behavior, so these are normally neurologists doing review work, the hypothesis is that there's a loss of inhibition and more specifically there is an imbalance between the medial pre-motor systems and the lateral pre-motor system.

102
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:43,680
The lesion in the medial system is the cause of this imbalance.

103
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,280
And they tend to speak of a loss of internally driven motor control.

104
00:16:50,881 --> 00:16:59,600
And they also note that normally the medial system functions upstream and controls the lateral one.

105
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:12,560
Going back to this picture, you see that both the green, so the lateral system projects on the motor cortex and the medial system projects on the motor cortex.

106
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:19,840
So when the medial, the red corner is lesion, the green gets dissignated.

107
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,160
That's the picture in the crystal.

108
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:38,800
But it's not very clear what they mean with this internally driven motor control, which should be endogenous and self-regul regulated that gets generated there in the medial pre-motor system.

109
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:55,000
And one way to investigate this further is by asking why aren't our everyday automatic actions, immediate actions, normally in line with our concerns and why are they contextually adequate normally?

110
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,481
And what are the neural mechanisms involved?

111
00:17:57,721 --> 00:18:16,201
And another question which I find very interesting and which is neglected in the literature, almost neglected in the literature in the visitation behavior, is how can it be that these patients are not aware that they do something inappropriate when they press somebody else's cup of coffee?

112
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:41,961
You can confound them with their behavior and then they won't they they don't care that they did it and they are not bothered that they did it.

113
00:18:43,241 --> 00:18:49,721
But you can you can convince them that they did something which is uh which is not uh appropriate.

114
00:18:49,721 --> 00:18:58,680
So it's not that they that they cannot be made to realize, but it's just that at the moment when the act doesn't play any role whether it's uh it's uh appropriate or not.

115
00:18:59,241 --> 00:19:00,840
We have to discontent.

116
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:15,000
That's the point, because they're in the room and the bed is ready to get into when they are you said something they feel or they say they're ordered to do it by the object.

117
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:17,721
Yeah, that's not when you ask them, so why do you do it?

118
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:28,201
They said the object ordered me to do it, but this should be more seen, I think, as a rationalization and that it's really precisely that they hear a voice uh from from the object they're hearing.

119
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:40,000
It could be a kind of description of a tendency that it's feel they feel bad there and they feel discontented there and they put the bed looks like they're the bat they feel good over there and contented over there.

120
00:19:40,161 --> 00:19:47,441
But they they don't they don't experience this uh this inappropriateness or uh they don't experience that something is wrong.

121
00:19:47,441 --> 00:19:56,400
They just I think the best way to to understand it is by just seeing it as as some attraction that that occurs and that they that they do experience.

122
00:19:56,401 --> 00:19:59,920
Uh but then when asked to describe it they say the object ordered me.

123
00:19:59,921 --> 00:20:14,081
But uh one problem with this literature is that the the the phenomenological part is often not so well described because neurologists tend to think of uh people like machines often, not all of them, but some of them do.

124
00:20:14,081 --> 00:20:17,201
So uh it's uh it's a bit neglected.

125
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:32,081
This sounds I don't know this is open questions for us, but I'm saying that's why this sounds very similar to act syndrome and it seems an argument for avoidances, but it argues against loner intentionality actually.

126
00:20:32,081 --> 00:20:37,361
What's missing is rationality and that they can't be lowly behavior at all.

127
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:49,600
And it seems like when you combine at a free or some personal level those avoidances, it seems at a personal level you have the ability to make a judgment as to the appropriate okay.

128
00:20:50,081 --> 00:20:50,960
Why would it be that?

129
00:20:51,121 --> 00:20:56,641
Yeah, it's it it would be being restored by personality of pure classes as well, I think.

130
00:20:56,641 --> 00:21:14,840
And then I don't like the word in this in this context, but it's um the way to think of it I think is to to remember that no how if I can call uh you're sitting down in a chair an automatic action, but only when I realize that it's controlled in a sense you can stop it.

131
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:21,241
It's not you uh doing something weirdly you if you would like to you can you can you can stop.

132
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:27,080
So um uh it refiner in a very limited sense of having control of what to do.

133
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,921
In all action.

134
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:35,880
For example, suppose they're about to sit in a chair and you say, Don't sit in that chair, the chair is broken.

135
00:21:36,201 --> 00:21:40,920
Now the way Jennifer thinks of it, they just can't stop, they just go on anyway.

136
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,800
And the way I understood it, well sure they wouldn't stop.

137
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,440
They're not autonomous.

138
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,721
They are they the the chair won't look comfortable anymore and they won't it won't order them anymore.

139
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:58,201
No, but when when they are told not to use the objects, they they do continue using it.

140
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:07,880
But um it may be um when you tell them to stop um I w I wouldn't know how they would trip.

141
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,360
I wouldn't know.

142
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,641
It's it's not as fair.

143
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:18,121
It's something that the importance of the good person having dormitivity goes that since the fast open relativity comes in.

144
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:30,360
You pointed out that the guy doesn't flash on the topic of the test and without thinking honestly and legalizing them in a probably and cannot position instead of styling another way.

145
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,520
But then what makes them I mean reason comes in at a certain time.

146
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:40,920
It doesn't sound like there's an argument for mono intentionality when the appropriate person sees a badge and thinks about it.

147
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:50,920
He doesn't have or he doesn't think they would well no, I I mean what's the argument that that you know um bad behavior is right.

148
00:22:50,920 --> 00:23:01,040
I don't think there's a there isn't a the reason of that I don't have an argument, but I think it doesn't think from from your own technology and from oils, I think there's no thinking over it going on.

149
00:23:07,201 --> 00:23:14,880
Uh perhaps it is this this uh perhaps in our case this performance monitoring system but then it's again a loss.

150
00:23:19,121 --> 00:23:25,920
So that you do have some some some control intensive ones in point of if you don't think about it.

151
00:23:27,201 --> 00:23:37,840
Partly in my thoughts, you benefit from the same point, but I think it's sort of it's a valid objection that there isn't a sort of correct uh argument for that disposition.

152
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:50,161
But one thing in favor of it is um is that it has a lot of understanding of the subject is not alternative of what actually would be the body setting if we engage in the motoring technology.

153
00:23:50,161 --> 00:23:59,121
But one thing that I find this demonstrates uh raises the question of the relation between um tasks in motoring technology.

154
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:23,681
Because one way of understanding utilization behavior is that you know part of the reason why I don't just grab her coffee is that I'm engaged in a task right now and the task is to drive off maybe work this one to the slide or if you're walking or talking part of the utilization behavior maybe the monitoring and finding out is a a lack of or disruptions of whatever it is that enables us to be caught up in tasks.

155
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,161
Yeah precisely this is correct and ever uh the task is being neglected.

156
00:24:28,161 --> 00:24:38,241
But the task are new situational concerns and so personal needs and tasks and has um preferences and and incorporated social norms.

157
00:24:43,241 --> 00:24:56,120
Well I mean I just think this is connected to a discussion we've been having all semester because what I think what the these um people who have the lesions, what the results suggest is that there's really two levels of normativity involved with affordances.

158
00:24:56,121 --> 00:25:03,080
There's the um norm of how to deal with the objects, you know, to eat the apple as opposed to you know your army or something.

159
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:06,041
Um and uh then there's another norm of win.

160
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:17,641
And it seems to me that uh that win norm is um much richer and more complex and uh really goes beyond the sort of barely perceptual um in a way.

161
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:28,681
And so um this does as Rick was just suggesting I think um bear on this question of when you're fully des describing uh affordance related behavior and perception and things like that.

162
00:25:29,001 --> 00:25:34,681
In normal behavior in normal behavior, do you need to include something of that personal level?

163
00:25:34,681 --> 00:25:35,800
I think so yes.

164
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:42,520
And so this this instrumental correct use as I call it which is one one level of normativity isn't sufficient.

165
00:25:42,521 --> 00:25:56,521
There should also be uh something more which is the um a broader type of of normativity and takes account of um yeah uh the the so the the social uh conventions for example.

166
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:59,800
But I guess the question is do you think that's a distinctively perceptual norm?

167
00:26:00,121 --> 00:26:03,241
I don't care about perceptual norms, it's just a norm in action.

168
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,121
I don't know if it's distinctively per perceptual.

169
00:26:07,641 --> 00:26:13,560
I think perception and action cannot be just cannot be uh separated in this type of behavior.

170
00:26:13,641 --> 00:26:14,520
Well let me put it this way.

171
00:26:14,681 --> 00:26:22,121
Uh does a normal subject, when they see the bed as something that could be lied down in, do they see it as something that's not to be lied down in now?

172
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,041
Um that's a phenomenological question, I think.

173
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,040
Um I think they just don't lie down in it.

174
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,560
I don't think they experience it.

175
00:26:32,081 --> 00:26:37,840
I don't think they experience normally a bed as not to be laying down in.

176
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:48,081
Only perhaps when someone tells them go laying down in the bed, but normally it just doesn't occur to them to lay down when the situation isn't appropriate.

177
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,681
I think that the normal people don't think about a bed for something to lie down in.

178
00:26:53,681 --> 00:26:55,280
Well, I was asking whether they see it that way.

179
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,960
They don't see lying that way.

180
00:26:58,081 --> 00:27:06,640
It depends on the situation if your music is comes up as something in which you look at that normal right now, but these bases.

181
00:27:06,641 --> 00:27:07,760
They only see it.

182
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:15,601
So when a normal person is tired of spend time, they'll have a relation to the bed, but that orders they don't go to it.

183
00:27:16,241 --> 00:27:24,161
And the utilization of the person is just like the normal person, except that the relationship objects isn't sensitive to the problems behind that.

184
00:27:24,241 --> 00:27:24,400
Yeah.

185
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,040
You receive that, you don't think that.

186
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:38,000
So then you should that's true that you speak from brain studies that show something happening in those medial areas for the normal.

187
00:27:38,001 --> 00:27:44,721
When the normal is engaged in the expert task or the task appropriate.

188
00:27:47,280 --> 00:28:02,321
The performance monitoring system, for example, should should sell a different and there may be a very small chance that the people working on neural performance monitoring in Instagram are going to do experiments.

189
00:28:02,561 --> 00:28:06,921
I really hope they will, but it's part of Shelby.

190
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,080
Okay.

191
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,920
So a bit more of the neuroscience part.

192
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:20,441
So the part of the brain damaged by these patients is the mediofrontal lobe.

193
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:31,961
This part of the brain is involved in motor planning and attention, in conflict and conflict monitoring and error monitoring.

194
00:28:33,721 --> 00:29:03,001
The people working on that topic of monitoring, performance monitoring, there seems to be now quite some convergence of opinions that the medial frontal lobe should be seen as a general performance monitoring victim involved from various types of actions and that it monitors in relation to what they call anticipated rewards.

195
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:06,441
This is a notion that comes from reinforcement learning.

196
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,441
I'll come back to that later.

197
00:29:09,721 --> 00:29:23,001
For the moment it's important to know that this part of the brain that's missing in these patients is seen as the interface of cognition, motivation, autonomic arousal and motor control.

198
00:29:23,001 --> 00:29:34,760
And that projections from this area, there are motor neurons projecting to other motor areas in the brain.

199
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:47,161
One thing that I would like to call your attention to is that this part of the brain is also involved in pain fun in pain functions.

200
00:29:47,121 --> 00:29:55,321
It um you can see it as like monitoring pain and it it responds to the uh affected distress of pain.

201
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:07,841
So another part of the brain is involved in more the sensory components of pain, but this part um uh has something to do with uh the unpleasantness uh experienced well in pain.

202
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:21,600
Um and I want to tell a bit about that now because um this may be an explanation why these patients are not um aware of the inappropriateness of their actions.

203
00:30:21,601 --> 00:30:34,561
Um so the the um this dorsal ACT activity there is related to the felt unpleasantness of physical pain.

204
00:30:34,561 --> 00:30:44,561
And recently it has been shown that uh that it's also uh active uh and plays an important role in the um experience of social pain.

205
00:30:44,561 --> 00:30:52,481
And an example of that uh would be the experience of distress that you can experience when you are excluded from a social group.

206
00:30:52,480 --> 00:31:11,280
And these uh Eisenberger and Lieberman, they did an experiment, an imaging experiment, um, where they put uh a person in a scanner and told him that they would be playing a game with other persons in two other people in two other scanners.

207
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:20,160
Um and um uh on the left you see uh a drawing of the first episodes of playing this game.

208
00:31:20,161 --> 00:31:23,361
It's a virtual bulb tossing game, as they call it.

209
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:35,201
And so it occurred that the players are towing to each other and also charing to the small handwriter on the bottom, which is the the the the person that is actually being scanned.

210
00:31:35,201 --> 00:31:43,920
Um and then in the second uh condition, uh at the beginning, this this uh person gets well the legal and he's uh excluded.

211
00:31:44,360 --> 00:32:05,561
And then what these uh uh experiments did was trying to um uh to to locate the the the the correlate the activity in the brain um of the difference between these situations, which activity was um uh measured in the dorsal ACT again.

212
00:32:05,561 --> 00:32:15,481
Uh and uh they correlated with uh a questionnaire about the experience distress that these people uh experience while being excluded.

213
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:25,800
And there's quite a strong correlation between uh this activity in the anterior singlet and this uh experience distress.

214
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:35,561
And the the experiment suggests that this may be uh the the experience of the social uh unpleasantness of pain.

215
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:43,000
Um this is just the first study on this topic, so it's not it has been replicated with just anything.

216
00:32:43,001 --> 00:32:58,681
Um but what it suggests is that um the the area that gets lesion in these patients um can be seen as as an alarm system uh and perhaps also as an as a first responder of title first aid.

217
00:32:58,681 --> 00:33:05,881
So there's this monitoring going on there uh which detects that things are going worse than than expected.

218
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:12,841
Uh then when when this happens at the same time uh it other areas of the brain are being engaged.

219
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:22,840
Uh but moreover there's also um uh this this self-unpleasantness uh that alerts the organism as a whole, or that may alert the organism as a whole.

220
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,441
This is not such a defect, it's just suggested.

221
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:42,320
Um and at the same time, this area, due to its motor capacities, also has the ability to give a first online reaction to what's going wrong to contribute to making a correct effect.

222
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,321
I think I skip this one.

223
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,121
And you can ask after the next two slides.

224
00:33:51,121 --> 00:34:00,640
Unless there's very let me do one question that we have personal, you can either have any utilization.

225
00:34:00,641 --> 00:34:03,121
Like I forget what he's done when he's making the wallets.

226
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,120
Is it that you just stick them in a wallet making a room and you'll use the wallet?

227
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,880
He was very good at making wallets.

228
00:34:10,161 --> 00:34:14,721
Actually, his performance was not normal, but almost normal.

229
00:34:15,201 --> 00:34:16,800
And well.

230
00:34:20,081 --> 00:34:21,040
It wasn't compulsive.

231
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,241
No, it wasn't that.

232
00:34:22,241 --> 00:34:25,040
It wasn't more like an approach to something.

233
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,760
No, there are people elsewhere.

234
00:34:28,081 --> 00:34:31,201
So I guess my question is what exactly makes nothing utilization behavior.

235
00:34:31,201 --> 00:34:36,241
So it usually case that you have normal, you put them in a room and you just start making wallets.

236
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,241
Where they put the patient in and let him make technological tests.

237
00:34:46,561 --> 00:34:49,520
And at the same time, there's this object on them.

238
00:34:49,681 --> 00:35:09,681
If he puts on the head, then they just score the occurrences of this behavior and then they also score if it's just throwing around if they're doing it like this, or if it's really normal sequence or something.

239
00:35:09,681 --> 00:35:12,721
How far from much of the legalization they go?

240
00:35:12,721 --> 00:35:16,201
So let's say you sit down as a green peers.

241
00:35:14,161 --> 00:35:20,601
You show him a piano and he just starts playing data doing work.

242
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,681
Or is it that he just goes and lists up the talk to the piano?

243
00:35:24,681 --> 00:35:27,081
I mean, how far is he playing to the fashion stuff?

244
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:35,080
One of the, again, one of the problems with the symbol needle, but it there's many and not many open questions.

245
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:44,041
But I suspect it would be always going.

246
00:35:44,121 --> 00:35:54,121
I didn't do mine and just opening piano, it was certainly that same, but I couldn't say how you thought the slightly just opened the piano.

247
00:35:55,001 --> 00:36:05,721
Since people can play the piano or at least the saxophone, so I read it in their sleep, then it looks like you're able to do a lot, even though you're you've lost the higher monitoring stuff.

248
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:09,960
Well, I was looking at the ballerina that's stuck in parallel and sockets.

249
00:36:11,641 --> 00:36:22,360
How uncontrollable is I guess this is a bit of a spare situation because there's no visual cube to create a yeah maybe there's a lot of music.

250
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:34,201
I think the music may behavior in case of the Callerina, but this is disk activation, I mean it doesn't make much sense.

251
00:36:35,001 --> 00:36:36,840
How much time has I made them go on?

252
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,360
You have a seven minutes.

253
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:46,681
Okay, so I'm afraid I won't have time to go into both freedom.

254
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,920
But anyway, I will just finish working again.

255
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:57,560
Yeah, no, but I will I will finish this one because I think it's important to speak about reinforcement learning and anticipation.

256
00:36:57,601 --> 00:37:08,721
Partly because you write about reinforcement learning, excluding reinforcement learning in your articles on maximum grid and for example in the one on that team Cambridge campaign.

257
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:18,721
So anticipation, first a bit from medical T and then some more on neural aspects of anticipation.

258
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,321
So Medical T writes somewhere at a very important presence actually.

259
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:34,081
We are brought to the recognition of something which is an anticipation of or arrived at the objective, which means your aim.

260
00:37:34,721 --> 00:37:43,201
And it is ensured by the body itself as a motor power, a motor project, radius and work, a motor intentionality.

261
00:37:43,521 --> 00:37:52,081
Now in many places in phenomenology of perception, you see anticipation playing an important role.

262
00:37:52,241 --> 00:37:59,121
It's very unsurprising because as I said in the beginning, when you acquire a skill, you acquire the ideas to anticipate.

263
00:38:00,081 --> 00:38:12,641
There's also a neural basis of anticipation and the core of it is shown in this, no, not the core, but one of the core systems involved is shown in this video.

264
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:20,241
So on top, the green, no, let me first explain the experiment.

265
00:38:21,521 --> 00:38:44,001
There has been done many experiments with monkeys and with humans where they which is a simple uh stimulus response uh uh um uh experiment where they um show a light and then um later on they they give the juice after a fixed uh period of time.

266
00:38:44,280 --> 00:39:10,921
And in the early learning stages, which is on top of the in the green, when the light is greater than here, then um nothing happens in the part of the brain that is involved in uh or that yeah that contributes to amphication, which is the uh uh the the upper part of the brainstem, the uh dopaminatic midbrain.

267
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:16,121
Um these these graphs show activity in that part of the brain.

268
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:28,280
When there is a light flashed, nothing happens, but then when there is a reward delivered, in this case the juice, you see this this phasic increase in uh the dopaminatic activity.

269
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:44,441
Uh the this juice arrives uh unexpectedly and then the monkey or the human uh brain um activity in that area uh reacts to it after the arrival of this what they call rewards, in this case juice.

270
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:51,080
But the interesting thing is that with learning um you don't have to wait.

271
00:39:51,081 --> 00:39:59,641
The the reaction of the of this part of the brain doesn't wait until the uh juice is being delivered, but anticipates its delivery.

272
00:39:59,641 --> 00:40:07,961
So then when the light is being flashed, when the light is being flashed, there is already a basic increase in this uh dopaminatic activity.

273
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:15,401
Um and uh that's not even the late training stage, the blue uh figure here.

274
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,121
So um there is what they call back propagation.

275
00:40:20,121 --> 00:40:32,961
The the uh the the flashing of the light already um makes uh triggers the reaction that normally would have been only there at the moment of arrival of the of the juice or the reward.

276
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:49,041
Then the lower figure is um when um when the lights flash, but then at the moment that uh you've learned to expect the uh the juice being delivered, there is no juice coming.

277
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:53,280
So um they call delayed reward because it's given later.

278
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,201
And then at that time there is this uh this activity again.

279
00:40:57,201 --> 00:41:04,241
So there is um the light flashes, you expect the juice to come, but it doesn't come.

280
00:41:04,241 --> 00:41:10,641
Um at that moment there is uh what they call negative reward prediction error.

281
00:41:10,641 --> 00:41:19,521
Uh and next one when the juice is delivered, there is another um another response and increasing the dolphinetic activity.

282
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:39,041
This is important because this this type of activity um contributes to um to reinforcement learning and uh contributes to building a a system that is able to anticipate um yeah, to build a system that is able to anticipate rewards.

283
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:43,840
And not any rewards actually, basic to any anticipated action.

284
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:58,961
Um so this this system is called oh actually no, this this what we've seen so far about the the passive uh just sitting there and getting the juice uh are not um situation.

285
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:07,681
There is a more active situation where they have people uh choosing uh responses, which is called extra critic reinforcement learning.

286
00:42:07,681 --> 00:42:12,641
Uh which is the paradigm coming from control theory and uh animal decision making.

287
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,441
Schulz is a neurophenologist working on this.

288
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:22,920
The idea is that with learning the system becomes able to anticipate future rewards.

289
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:29,721
The interesting thing for it is that there's no need for any goal representation here.

290
00:42:29,721 --> 00:42:44,601
And that's because one part of the brain, what's called the adaptive critic, learns to predict future rewards and the other part of the brain, the actor, learns to select better and better actions.

291
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:58,681
It's being trained by the critic and it responds not only to the stimulus being given but also to the activation at a certain moment in the brain.

292
00:42:58,681 --> 00:43:05,081
So it takes the current activation of the brain into account when it selects an action.

293
00:43:07,241 --> 00:43:09,241
I'll skip this one.

294
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:18,041
There's increasing neurobiological plausibility for this type of learning to occur in the brain.

295
00:43:18,681 --> 00:43:25,800
So it's even more useful, I think, to read this with this article on reinforcement learning and maximum grift.

296
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:37,481
Recently an fMRI study has been able to dissociate these two roles in the human brains before it had been done already in apes or monkeys.

297
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:51,241
And it becomes more and more clear that the dopamine protections from the midbrain play an uh an important uh computational role uh in anticipation uh or anticipatory behavior.

298
00:43:51,241 --> 00:43:58,921
Um so what's the effect of this this phasic increase uh in dopamine that we've seen in the colorful picture before?

299
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:16,721
Actually, it occurs within about 100 milliseconds, so one tenth or two tenths of a second, very rapidly, rapidly enough to guide online behavior of the organism in the complex and uncertain environment.

300
00:44:18,001 --> 00:44:21,600
And they tend to describe it as follows.

301
00:44:21,601 --> 00:44:36,241
Doppler increases the likelihood that an action, a valuable action for the organism gets chosen now because this impact is immediate, but also in the future because of the learning.

302
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:48,321
There's also a theory on performance monitoring that includes this work on the neural weight of rewards by Schultz.

303
00:44:48,480 --> 00:45:05,841
And they say that this area that gets damaged in utilization behavior, and that's involved in performance monitoring, shows that it receives these dopaminatic projections.

304
00:45:06,241 --> 00:45:19,521
And when things go worse than expected, a basic cause in mid-brain dopaminatic activity triggers something which they call error-related negativity or O shit potential.

305
00:45:19,521 --> 00:45:31,681
It's seen in in between experiments, it's just like the the same spot that you've that you've seen before in the colourful uh picture, it's a certain area.

306
00:45:31,681 --> 00:45:36,241
Um, what's the singleton, uh as they call it?

307
00:45:36,241 --> 00:45:40,000
Um it's like it's like the alarm signal that we've seen before.

308
00:45:40,001 --> 00:45:46,441
It engages other uh areas uh perhaps or for top down control later on.

309
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:51,560
But more importantly, there's also something happened uh something happening immediately.

310
00:45:51,561 --> 00:45:56,280
So there's some immediate uh adjustment to the situation.

311
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:00,601
Something goes seems to go wrong, something goes worse than expected.

312
00:46:00,601 --> 00:46:07,321
Um this is the this is the moment that that it may be adequate to select another uh possibility for action.

313
00:46:07,721 --> 00:46:10,361
Are you saying that that's directly disconcerting?

314
00:46:10,681 --> 00:46:21,241
No, I'm not I'm not I I hope it will be related in some way to direct to this because in the end I try to figure out what will be the mechanisms underlying it.

315
00:46:21,241 --> 00:46:24,280
Um but you cannot say it is direct to discontent.

316
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,800
No, no, of course it might be.

317
00:46:27,001 --> 00:47:02,280
And interesting is that so it's the same type of area and it may be that this this experience of unpleasantness or so the the pain you say you feel when you when you experience something going wrong you can call it pain, the displeasantness of it, that that when this this area gets damaged often with point to the documentariatic signal arriving doesn't occur.

318
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:15,080
But it's at the moment it's just open and so this part of the brain is involved in value-based action selection as they call it.

319
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:23,481
So guiding decisions about which actions are worth doing based on the expected value.

320
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:30,481
We take into account the future and this is possible thanks to the critic activity that we've seen before.

321
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:55,280
And it's interesting that the value-based action selection occurs not in just any situation, but in situations that seem to fit everyday activity very well, namely free choice situations, which can be distinguished from situations where an experimenter tells you what to do.

322
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:01,681
And moreover, there's activity there when immediate action is required.

323
00:48:01,681 --> 00:48:14,400
So it's online directly after a change in expectations like you would correct your behavior online immediately when your copy slips out of your hand.

324
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:23,441
Now going back to utilization behavior, so now we've seen all this about performance monitoring and the important learning.

325
00:48:24,561 --> 00:48:32,241
Can we say more about what may be the mechanism underlying utilization behavior?

326
00:48:32,561 --> 00:48:45,280
So the area that's used as virtual HTTP and PSMA, such a lesion may increase the likelihood of the selection of an inappropriate possibility for action.

327
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:58,881
The impaired monitoring because of the lesion may lead also to less corrective action being taken.

328
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:28,040
And as the same area is also involved in the unpleasantness experience with an error or with social pain, lesion there may lead to the absence of an awareness of and if that is the case, then you would expect because of the relation between physical pain and social pain, you would expect patients with utilization behavior to have some attenuated unpleasantness experience of physical pain.

329
00:49:28,041 --> 00:49:31,881
So that would be a a way to test uh test this.

330
00:49:32,201 --> 00:49:36,361
I I'm going back to Sanskrit's actual question while you were involved.

331
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:47,720
So skeptic might say that you're purchasing non-deliberation and non-judgment at the personal level by just shifting them all down to the quite personal level.

332
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:53,721
You've got mountains, you've got boundaries, you've got volumes, you've got volumes, you've got deciders.

333
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:58,760
So are you really giving a possible non-judgmental effect?

334
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,081
Stop giving give a quick answer, really.

335
00:50:01,241 --> 00:50:01,560
Okay.

336
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:21,001
A way to account for that would be and by means of the the the the critic role that that that um that is able to do all this that should be able to do all this without uh uh taking uh without referring to explicit goals and explicit deliberation.

337
00:50:21,001 --> 00:50:26,840
So that would be the way to go uh like like Professor Greyfus did in his article on reimportant learning.

338
00:50:27,001 --> 00:50:28,840
The actocritic models would be the way to
