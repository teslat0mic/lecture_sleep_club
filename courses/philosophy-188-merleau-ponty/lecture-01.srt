1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,240
So Searle's course, which is dedicated to understanding the relation between mind and world in his philosophy of mind, and doing it by talking about representations, propositional representations in the mind, which represents the world.

2
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:29,359
That's exactly the view which Merilo-Ponty considers the Cartesian view that he's opposed to.

3
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:43,120
And it's important to have that because it's so neat that somebody should be defending in a very detailed and convincing way the view that Meriloponty is criticizing.

4
00:00:43,119 --> 00:01:01,919
Meriloponty hasn't read Searle, naturally, but he's read Husserl, who has some commitments, surely, that Searle doesn't have, and Searle has some developments that Husserl doesn't have, but at the level that Merillo-Ponty is objecting, they would be very, very similar.

5
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:17,080
So, and I, and I will put it in the website, I have to explain this now, instead of making a reader of relevant papers, on the back of your syllabus, you see a whole bunch of relevant papers, I decided that I think it'll work to just have a virtual reader.

6
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:28,919
A virtual reader is a website, I give you the number at the bottom of that, in which I will put all the papers that I think would be helpful, really good papers by Merleau-Ponty.

7
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,679
Up to about two or three years ago, there weren't any.

8
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,679
But suddenly, there's a bunch of good ones around.

9
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:44,039
And I could add a paper I wrote putting up the Merleau-Ponty view against the Searle view.

10
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,479
How many of you had Philosophy of Mind?

11
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:46,519
Is it worth it?

12
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,479
Oh, yeah, a lot.

13
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:54,520
Okay, I'll put my Merlot-Ponty versus Searle paper on the virtual website.

14
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:08,999
And then in terms of Kant, Merle-Ponty is always criticizing what he calls an intellectualist account of what makes possible our experience of objects.

15
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,400
He's constantly talking about conditions of possibility.

16
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,239
And that's Kant.

17
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:24,280
And he is opposing that to what he calls conditions of existence.

18
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,359
And that's Heidi.

19
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:34,280
And he's, and it's going to just sound empty and mysterious to you now, but that's inevitable.

20
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:41,240
I mean, what it looks like to work out an intellectualist account, and you'll see him doing it for everything that he takes on.

21
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:48,520
He'll tell you how it would look to a Kantian or neo-Kantian, and he'll tell you how it would look to a human.

22
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,479
I'll come back to this, or you would get an empiricist account.

23
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:55,439
And then he'll give you his version.

24
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,640
And his version is always about what he calls conditions of existence.

25
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:11,359
It's about, one way to put it, is how what the enabling conditions are for what the possibility people are talking about.

26
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:28,799
And that always turns out to be what experience is like when you're involved in ongoing coping with things, as opposed to being detached and being a subject observing things.

27
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,039
I come back to all of these in a minute.

28
00:03:31,999 --> 00:03:50,239
So Heidegger, against the representationalist view and against the conditions of the possibility view, has got a non-propositional, non-conceptual account of what he thinks of as our primordial openness to the world.

29
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:54,239
And that's what Merleafoni is interested in, too.

30
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,039
That's what he calls conditions of existence.

31
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:05,519
Now, all of this got suddenly more relevant by the fact that about, was it five years ago now, maybe a little more, Ms.

32
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,880
Dow John McDowell published a book called Mind and World.

33
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,160
How many have come across that in some philosophy course?

34
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,160
Not as many as I would have thought.

35
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:27,919
But it's mind and world is as near to a Merleau-Ponty-like account of perception as you could get, and still get it, from Merlot-Ponty's point of view, completely wrong.

36
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:52,600
That is, having described perception and the conditions that it must satisfy to connect us up with the world, and saying that we are open to the lay of the world thanks to perception, all Heidegger and Merle-Ponty-like sounding things, McDowell goes on to say, and the only way perception could do that is if it were conceptual all the way out.

37
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:57,400
Now, what exactly he means by that, I'm not sure I know.

38
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,280
But whatever it is, I'm sure that it's not what Merlot-Ponty wants to say.

39
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:13,559
Merle-Ponty wants to say, in the current jargon that's going around, that what he's discussing is a preconceptual, pre-linguistic relation between us and the world.

40
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,600
And perception is like that.

41
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:27,240
And you can't treat it as having, in some kind of jargon, propositional content.

42
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:38,200
And you can't think that when we perceive something, it's just like believing something, except that it's got some sensuous characteristic.

43
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:45,319
You know, it's totally different than thinking something, believing something, and inferring something.

44
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,999
And Merle-Ponty is going to try to explain how that is.

45
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:57,479
Whereas McDowell thinks somehow it has to be enough like believing and inferring so that you can base your beliefs and inferences on perception.

46
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,880
Interesting puzzle is going to turn up.

47
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:13,000
One of the interesting puzzles is to figure out how, even though perception isn't propositional and conceptual, we nonetheless can base our beliefs and our inferences on perception.

48
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:14,680
That's interesting.

49
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,560
That's basic.

50
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,280
That's one of the things you've got to keep in mind in the course.

51
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:24,479
It's not altogether clear that it isn't as if Mary LePonte's got this one figured out very well.

52
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,160
He knows that perception isn't like conception.

53
00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:34,239
Sentience isn't like sapiens, as Brandon puts it.

54
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,520
He knows that.

55
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,360
And he knows that we're going to have to figure out how perception can ground thinking.

56
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,600
But he hasn't got anything to say about that.

57
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,640
He promised a book on the subject, and then he died before he wrote it.

58
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:55,760
And I don't think he could have written it because he had something like 20 years between the time he promised it and the time he died that he didn't write it.

59
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:05,360
But in the background, you've got to realize that he sort of owns that.

60
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:14,960
But even if he only got perception right and showed that it wasn't conceptual, that was a special mode of relating, or it isn't even relating.

61
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,680
It's a certain mode of our engagement with reality.

62
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,840
That would be a huge contribution.

63
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:30,239
And then it would be up to us, which is what I think is that the current interesting issue in philosophy that McDowell has run up against from one angle.

64
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:34,400
And how many come across Bob Brandon's book, Make It Explicit in some course?

65
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,200
These are the big heroes of Pittsburgh philosophy.

66
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,320
It's amazing how provincial philosophy is.

67
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:53,840
Anyway, it's a problem that people are beginning to worry about more and more, which is the relation of perception to thought.

68
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,080
And but it and before you can even worry about it, you've got to get perception right.

69
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,520
So you have to think of this course as doing that.

70
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:09,720
Now, it's interesting that this is just a kind of gossip aside, and this is an intellectual history that I find it I find it fascinating.

71
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:20,760
It's quite interesting that analytic philosophers have come up against this question of whether perception is conceptual or not.

72
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:32,440
And they come up with it because a philosopher at Oxford, Gareth Evans, was very interested in this issue.

73
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:45,960
And Gareth Evans is interested in this issue, partly because Charles Taylor was one of his teachers, who was very, very interested in this issue, because Charles Taylor's a Marilla-Ponty and through and through in analytic philosophical disguise.

74
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:56,840
And so that the idea that analytic philosophers are coming around now to have a question that Marilla Ponty had on his mind in 1945 is not an accident.

75
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:02,920
It just took sort of a long time to germinate in Oxford and in our tradition.

76
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:12,680
So I mentioned Charles Taylor because he's the first one I put on the list of background on the virtual website.

77
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:20,200
Taylor's got this sort of overall view of Marilla Ponty and why you think they're important.

78
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,080
And it's interesting to read it, though he never works it out in detail.

79
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:33,960
He's just but he's got but he is sort of and he would be the first to say so well he he said to me once that he was about to give up philosophy at Oxford.

80
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,720
He's bicultural.

81
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,239
He's Canadian French, but he also perfectly uh third English.

82
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:46,840
And he was at Oxford, he was a Rhodes scholar, and he said he was about to give up philosophy, it was so boring.

83
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:52,960
And then he came across Marillo-Ponty, and ever since then, he's been one of our most interesting philosophers.

84
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,840
So you might want to read the Charles Taylor thing on the virtual website.

85
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:03,440
And now, and the person, well, I'll say one more thing.

86
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:17,519
And another person you've never heard of, Daniel Totis, who's written a book called Body and the World, is the one who's gone furthest, sort of taking up the Merlot-Ponty line and going further with it.

87
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:25,200
He wrote this book in 64, and it's been as his PhD piece, but right now it's becoming very relevant.

88
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:48,960
So I put Totis' book on reserve in the philosophy, and he gives an account of perception that, well, when you read Merleau-Ponty, you'll see that though Merilloponte is all about the role of the body and perception, you never could find out by listening, by reading Merillo-Ponty what in the world having a body is like.

89
00:10:48,960 --> 00:11:05,200
If you were a Martian reading Merlot-Ponty, you know that the body is something that we move around, and that it's very important that we move around, and that perception is intimately connected with the fact that we've got that we are embodied and moved around, but that's about it.

90
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:20,320
And Totis is trying to figure out sort of the role what the basic structure of the body, that it's got an up and a down, a right and a left, a front and a back, moves forward more easily than backward, and balances in a gravitational field.

91
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,560
All those important facts about the body, what role do they play in the way we perceive the world?

92
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:39,239
So eventually, after we've got Merlot-Ponte, if there's time at the end, I will read a chapter of TOTIS, but I will put it on your list there as something that as back in.

93
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,560
Where's my version of the witch?

94
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,160
I don't remember how soon I put it in, and maybe too soon.

95
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,960
Maybe I didn't put it in at all.

96
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,520
I'm happy to be too late.

97
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,080
Yeah, but it's not on my background reading.

98
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,000
So I think of it as background reading for the last week.

99
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:01,239
So we don't need to worry about it yet.

100
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:04,760
But that's where Merlot-Ponty was heading.

101
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:12,920
Okay, now it's the still a little bit more background, and then I get to the phenomenological method, which is where we should be starting.

102
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:17,639
Merloponty's relation to Husserl and Heidegger is something I mentioned.

103
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:24,680
Merleau-Ponty, for reasons that I don't know, wants to think of himself as a Husserlian, not a Heideggerian.

104
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:39,960
And he's going through contortions and distortions in the preface to the Phenomenology of Perception, trying to say that really he's the heir to what he calls the third period of Husserl, where Husserl became an existential.

105
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,159
Well, that's wrong.

106
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:42,039
It's nonsense.

107
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,280
Husserl never became existential.

108
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:54,840
And Merlopony was basing this all on unpublished manuscripts which he had read, which now that they are published, nobody can find some of the crucial sentences that Merlot-Ponty was basing this on.

109
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,880
So don't read the prefaces tomorrow with this.

110
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:04,680
Start where I find this one page, with the book itself.

111
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:06,440
Is it called preface?

112
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,080
It is, isn't it?

113
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:09,720
It's called preface, right?

114
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,320
That was obviously written later.

115
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,600
That was obviously written.

116
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:16,519
I think what's really happened, but this is, again, just intellectual gossip.

117
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:34,479
I think that in 1945, it was not politic to be a Heideggerian when Heidegger had turned out to be a Nazi and the French had just been liberated, whereas Husserl, a good Jewish philosopher, was a great patron to be the descendant of.

118
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:45,520
So I think he was just sort of covering up his Heidegger tracks and pulling out the Husserl resonances to get his book to be acceptable.

119
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,880
In any case, I don't think you need to read it.

120
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:56,160
And because he really agrees with Heidegger, not with Husserl.

121
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:02,560
Husserl has propositional representations, and that's what he doesn't agree with.

122
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:19,680
We got to go back to our experience of the world that is non-representational, non-propositional, pre-conceptual, pre-predicative, etc.

123
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,160
Sometimes pre-linguistic.

124
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:26,800
And he's got to go to Heidegger for that.

125
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:35,039
But when he does talk about Heidegger, I'll just read you one place to show you how strangely dismissive he is.

126
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,959
On the top of Roman numeral seven.

127
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,159
What?

128
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:43,359
That's very interesting.

129
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:44,639
I must be cracking up.

130
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,999
Is it true that there's no Roman numeral seven?

131
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,040
That it goes from six, oh, seven is here.

132
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,759
I see.

133
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,720
And eight is there.

134
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:55,600
Okay, seven just doesn't have a number on it.

135
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:09,160
But at the bottom of the first page of the preface, which is Roman numeral seven, he's talking about how phenomenology tries to give a direct description of our experience as it is.

136
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:19,639
That's fine for Husserl and Heidegger, without taking account of its psychological origin and the causal explanations which science, historian, and sociology may be able to provide.

137
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:30,039
And then, skipping a little, he says, one may try to do away, oh, well, he's talking about how Husserl seems to be saying that and yet not doing that.

138
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:37,639
And he says, one may try to do away with these contradictions by making a distinction between Husserl and Heidegger's phenomenology, which is the right thing to do, I think.

139
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:56,439
Yet the whole of Reinhard, being in time, springs from an indication given by Husserl, which amounts to no more than an explicit account of the natural world concept, the naturalist of Eltegrift, or the Leibnizfeld, the life world, which Husserl toward the end of his life identified as the central theme of phenomenology.

140
00:15:56,439 --> 00:16:07,479
But the basic thing to see is that when Husserl talks about the life world, it's always from the point of view of a detached observer looking at objects.

141
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:24,840
The big switch in Heidegger that Merlot-Ponteen is taking up is that they want to describe human experience when you're most engaged, when you're in the flow, when you're actually coping with objects in the most skilled way.

142
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:36,439
It isn't even enough just to sort of observe an object while walking around it, which is the nearest Husserl ever got to an engaged attitude, is to describe what it's like to walk around a tube that he had on his desk.

143
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:39,159
No, you've got to actually, in Heidegger, be hammering.

144
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:46,119
In Merlot-Ponte, you've got to be perceiving the world and trying to get a better look at it all the time.

145
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:54,800
And that's the flipple from Husserl to Heidegger, which he knows is thought, but which he isn't going to tell you about.

146
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:03,199
So now let's go to the phenomenological method that he's got.

147
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:13,279
Husserl's phenomenological method is detached reflection on your experience while you're observing.

148
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:19,840
Now, Merilloponte's is to describe the world while you cope with it.

149
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,999
But I can't find him saying exactly that, but I'll give you a few references.

150
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,080
By the way, what I'm doing is telling you things from the preface that I think are important, because I don't think you should read it.

151
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,519
It would just confuse you.

152
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:38,959
But at the bottom of the first page, he says, I've read that, giving you a direct account of experience.

153
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:48,800
That means don't take what neuroscience tells you, don't take what physiology tells you, don't even take what common sense tells you.

154
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
You've got to go back and look.

155
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,679
And it's very hard to look.

156
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:01,600
So, and he says, I'll skip ahead, because now that I've said it, it's very hard to look.

157
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,239
Someplace he says, nothing can be harder than to describe experience.

158
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:08,320
Where is that?

159
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,239
On page 58.

160
00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:14,560
Oh, well, it must be 58 in this one.

161
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,919
I think it is.

162
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,439
Then I have to tell you where it is in that one.

163
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:20,720
Yeah, oh dear.

164
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:21,999
I had it in this one.

165
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,279
That's so funny.

166
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,679
And now, why don't I have it here?

167
00:18:26,879 --> 00:18:28,479
I just didn't type it in.

168
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,919
I don't think it's a good idea for me to spend time looking for it right now.

169
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,199
I'll just read it to you.

170
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:38,199
Nothing is more difficult than to know precisely what we see.

171
00:18:38,199 --> 00:18:40,279
There is a natural intuition.

172
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:49,159
There is a natural intuition that is just seeing things, a sort of crypto mechanism, which we have to break in order to reach phenomenal beings.

173
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:53,879
Or again, a dialectic whereby perception hides itself from itself.

174
00:18:53,879 --> 00:19:03,239
But although it is of the essence of consciousness to forget its own phenomena, thus enabling things to be constituted, this forgetfulness is not mere absence.

175
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,320
It's the absence of something which consciousness could bring into presence.

176
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,879
In other words, that's a stop with that.

177
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:26,840
So those of you who had the Heidegger will recognize this claim, which is that phenomenology deals with something which in Heidegger language withdraws or remains hidden so that you can have experience of objects.

178
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:34,039
But this is, though it withdraws and is hidden, it's not absolutely unconscious or unaccessible.

179
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:36,199
It's just hard to get at.

180
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,840
And the job of phenomenology is to get it.

181
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:47,480
Merlot-Ponty has, well, Heidegger's main way of getting it is breakdown.

182
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:59,720
So when equipment, like hammer, equipment to function well, you become aware of the world and a lot of the background that's involved in being able to use equipment.

183
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:02,359
Never mind that for those who haven't had Heidegger.

184
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:04,920
Merloponte's got an entirely different angle.

185
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:23,280
What he's got is the same structure, that there is something crucial in our experience, which has to be hidden and withdrawn for us to see things, but which under certain conditions we can notice and pay attention to anyway.

186
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,679
The example I used when I teach Heidier comes from Marillo-Ponty, is what went by.

187
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,719
Marilo-Ponty, I listened to Mariloponte's lectures at the College of Home for a long time ago.

188
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:50,399
And one of the interesting things he said was, and talked about, was the way the illumination in the room has to become invisible in the you don't notice its color, its brightness, or if you didn't have any lights, particular lights, you could just have general illumination.

189
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:55,119
The illumination is what you don't see in order for you to see the objects.

190
00:20:55,119 --> 00:21:01,759
If the room was full of dust so that it was as if you could see the illumination, you couldn't see the objects.

191
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:15,600
So the way perception works, a lot of what makes it possible for theology, has to be done, so to speak, outside of your main focus.

192
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,719
And that's what he wants to talk about.

193
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:20,879
Now, how do you talk about that?

194
00:21:21,199 --> 00:21:29,919
Well, you'll see he has at least three techniques, which he never just sort of risked, but I can try to risk them.

195
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:37,439
So he's got breakdown cases.

196
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,679
It's got to be breakdown cases.

197
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:52,080
There's got to be cases, because when perception is going just fine and you're all into it in a flow, you're not going to notice what makes it possible for you to perceive things.

198
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,520
The first thing he's got is lots of neural cases, which is something getting more and more popular.

199
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:15,719
He was way ahead of his time, I think, to be a philosopher who draws on all kinds of brain-injured people, stages of various to see what it's like when some one of our perceptual capacities is missing.

200
00:22:15,719 --> 00:22:27,159
And then that helps you realize what this missing part is like by seeing what it'd be like to be somebody with a certain kind of brain injury.

201
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:31,000
There are lots of interesting cases, and you'll get them as you get them.

202
00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:32,519
Yeah, just perfect.

203
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:59,080
You're now going to explain Rolapanti's methods for getting at, it's so hard to understand, to see personally see that what's really going on when you perceive all the background, the work that the phenomena are doing, like the color constancy and the brightness constancy and the stability.

204
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:08,759
Let's put it this way: seeing a stable figure here, me as a lecture, fixed, determinate, with properties, and so forth.

205
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,840
That's an amazing achievement.

206
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,320
Of course, it's a big achievement on the level of what the brain is doing, but that's not our business.

207
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:17,080
We can't deal with that.

208
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,000
We're not neuroscientists.

209
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,439
But it's an amazing achievement on the level of phenomenology.

210
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:27,560
You can actually get at it in various ways.

211
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:32,679
So it's what is with, how is it on 58?

212
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,840
Nothing words equivalent to know what we see.

213
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:41,959
Yeah, but then that turns out to mean not just the objects we see, but our experience of seeing them is one way to put it.

214
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:43,560
We've talked about that.

215
00:23:43,560 --> 00:24:00,080
So because perception hides itself, that is, we see the objects, but what he I see why you're asking this, but he wants to say, yes, but the consciousness forgets its own phenomena, enabling things to be constituted.

216
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:06,320
And that means that there's something going on that enables us to see objects.

217
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,199
And we're conscious of that too, but only marginally.

218
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:18,159
What confused me was talking about what makes it an investigation of what makes it possible to include that.

219
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:23,760
Of course, that's why we said this from the investigation of what you saw along.

220
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,679
You don't see your real estate.

221
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:25,999
No, right.

222
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:27,840
Right.

223
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,239
So that.

224
00:24:28,639 --> 00:24:40,800
Okay, I guess that's where one should say, not scientifically possible, not even logically possible, but this story about conditions of existence.

225
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:57,600
What experiences of objects makes it possible to make it possible for us to see stable objects, which, when we're looking at stable objects, we're not bringing attention to those theory.

226
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:13,519
It helps to go right on from that because you're not going to find that out directly by looking at these neuro gigs, although you will learn something by seeing what specific laps that people can have.

227
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:19,600
But one way you can see it directly, he thinks, is to see what artists do.

228
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:28,159
And particularly Cézanne, who thinks that Cézanne was actually sort of, I guess, the great phenomenologist of perception.

229
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:41,240
That Cézanne was able to paint a painting that slowed down and brought in all the factors that contribute to seeing an object of movie.

230
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:48,999
So that when you saw his painting, it wasn't like seeing a finished object made in the days of perspective and so forth.

231
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,800
It was as if an object was coming into being as you looked at the painting.

232
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,679
You'll never see Cézanne again once you had read this article.

233
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:02,440
Certainly, now I could spend hours in front of Cézanne and got one in my office.

234
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:07,159
But Meryloponte is trying to get what Cézanne saw.

235
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:09,320
And now that's something to read soon.

236
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,119
And that's, I'm going to have that on reserve.

237
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:24,919
I can't put that on the virtual website because it's in the book, Sense and Nonsense, which is, and you can take it out and Xerox it.

238
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:45,720
But there is an article there that Cézanne's doubt, in which he tries to show how Cézanne manages to describe our experiencing of objects instead of describing, or paint our experiencing of objects, instead of painting the objects as we finally see them, as finished.

239
00:26:46,040 --> 00:27:04,119
He paints what Merlopony thinks is our objects coming into the kind of determinateness and stability that they have in our everyday, well, what we see in our everyday feeling.

240
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:11,320
He paints the, not, he doesn't paint the object and its properties, he paints our experience of, okay, that's the second thing.

241
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:16,199
And you might want to look at Cézanne's piece pretty soon because it's so good.

242
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:31,199
And finally, and this is something he never kind of thematized, but he's got a genius for slowing down our everyday perception so that he finds cases where it isn't exactly breakdown.

243
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:43,519
It's just that something is happening that makes perception difficult, so that you can see your perception at work, trying to get a grip on the objects.

244
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,600
I'll give you two examples, which will come across later in the book.

245
00:27:48,000 --> 00:28:01,600
He wants to tell you that we're constantly trying to get what he calls a maximum grip on objects, where we will get the most clarity and the most detail and the most shape and so forth.

246
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:09,279
And you'll find yourself sort of struggling to get a maximum grip on your intellect or unit blackboard.

247
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:15,119
But he says, consider what you do when you're looking at a new painting in a museum.

248
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:23,919
Then you have to move around to try to get to the position where you get the optimal of detail and the optimal of the overall shape.

249
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,239
And moreover, you don't sort of move around willfully.

250
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,320
Your body moves you around.

251
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:38,560
You just find yourself either getting closer or getting further away, trying to get the best view you can of it.

252
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:50,320
And he wants you to see in that what you're doing all the time, only you're not noticing it because I think you're so good already at getting the best distance from people and doors and tables.

253
00:28:50,320 --> 00:29:05,399
You've got to bring in some weird situation where, as in a museum, you've got some new kind of object and you haven't got a, your body hasn't already got a a skill for just going to the right place to get the best sight of it.

254
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:06,359
Okay, here's another one.

255
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:15,159
These will be more relevant to you when they come up in the context, but I do want you to just see that he keep your eye open for these wonderful moves.

256
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:21,320
He wants you to see that your perception is indeterminate.

257
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:38,840
And that means something like confused, ambiguous, unstable, and then you have to sort of find the right attitude or the right body set to get the clarity in it.

258
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:52,679
And his example is: you're walking along in, I think it probably Stockholm, where he doesn't say, but you're walking along someplace where the boats and the trees are all sort of mixed together.

259
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:55,720
And you come across something and it doesn't look right to you.

260
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:57,720
You can't quite figure out what it is.

261
00:29:57,719 --> 00:30:01,479
And you're looking at it and looking at it and it's sort of unstable.

262
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:12,439
And then it clicks into place and you see that it's what you thought was a mishmash is a combination of some trees and some massive boats.

263
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:15,480
And that gets stabilized in there.

264
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:32,519
But you're supposed to be able to experience this unstable thing and this ability that we have to finally get a grip on it, whereby seeing a case in which it's bizarre enough so that our normal getting a grip on it gets slowed down and we can see it.

265
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:43,239
That's the kind of example that he's going to use to get you to see the kind of perceptual activity we've got.

266
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,239
I'll give you one more.

267
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:55,919
He talks, he wants to convince you that what you see is not what is projected on your retina.

268
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,199
And he has neat ways of doing that.

269
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:16,080
He says, well, in a movie where the movie camera just actually is like the retina, that is, on the film, you're going to get whatever it is that the optics puts there, an approaching train seems to get bigger and bigger at a great rate.

270
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:25,439
And that's because the camera hasn't got the ability to give the approaching train size constancy.

271
00:31:25,439 --> 00:31:32,639
Whereas, another way to put the same thing, he talks about when you take a picture of somebody with their foot toward the camera, you've got this great big foot.

272
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:34,480
That's for the foreshortener.

273
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:38,480
When you're using your cell phone to take your own picture, you've got a great big nose.

274
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,600
That's because it doesn't have size constancy.

275
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,800
It really gives you what the kind of see you've got on your retina.

276
00:31:46,799 --> 00:32:00,079
He's trying to convince you that you don't see the perceptual world the way the world is projected in your eye.

277
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,719
That's, and now I want to get to the next point.

278
00:32:02,719 --> 00:32:04,240
That's a transition.

279
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:24,880
That if you thought that perception amounted to copying what you got on your eye, you would be making the, what he calls, you would be making the mistake of having of entertaining the constancy hypothesis.

280
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,520
He talks about that very early on.

281
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,440
Let me show you where.

282
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:35,080
On page seven of the old one, let's go to the new one, page eight.

283
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:56,760
I'm telling you this partly to avoid you getting into a confusion, which you'll bound to if you, on the middle of page eight, he says, physiology of perception begins by recognizing an anatomical path leading from a received through a definite transmitter to a recording station equally specialized.

284
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:10,440
The objective world being given, it is assumed, oh, sorry, being given, it is assumed that it passes on to the sense organs messages which must be registered and deciphered in such a way as to reproduce in us the original text.

285
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:18,920
Hence, we have, in principle, a point-by-point correspondence and constant connection between the stimulus and the elementary perception.

286
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:23,159
But this constancy hypothesis conflicts with the data of consciousness.

287
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:29,560
See, the constancy hypothesis says that there ought to be a constant relation between what's on your retina and what you see.

288
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:33,159
That would mean like the train getting bigger and bigger as it came towards you.

289
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:40,760
Or like the, well, there are lots of other cases, but that's enough.

290
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:54,839
The constancy hypothesis thinks that that's what you see, and then somehow the visual system has to interpret that as the object remaining in the phase of it.

291
00:33:54,839 --> 00:34:08,839
It has to do something with this constancy data that you're getting from your sense organs to fill it in or fix it so that it looks a stable size per second.

292
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:33,359
And I want to, so the constancy hypothesis is a wrong view that leads you to think that somehow the job of the visual system and the job of perception is to compensate somehow for our direct experience of what is hitting.

293
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,200
our sense organs.

294
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,400
And he thinks that's wrong.

295
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,680
He's very influenced by Geschal psychology.

296
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:54,080
He thinks that we directly experience objects having constant size, even though the light is changing in color somewhat with constant color and so forth.

297
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,999
There are, and you'll hear lots about this in your reading Thursday.

298
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,680
There are perceptual constancies.

299
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,600
And our experience has, we have them directly.

300
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:22,800
We don't have to start with experience of what's on the retina and then somehow explain how it seems that things remain the same size or how we manage to conclude that they remain the same size as they approach us, that they really look the same size as they approach us.

301
00:35:22,799 --> 00:35:24,879
Unless, of course, perception is broken down.

302
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:31,360
If something gets really far so close to us like this, then it might, then you don't know what size it is.

303
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,399
Or, as I like to look from airplanes, you may have done this.

304
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,360
You've seen that the houses and cars and everything look the size they look as you start to take off.

305
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:43,520
And then all of a sudden, I've never been able to catch exactly where and how it happens.

306
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,560
They look like little toy cars and little toy houses.

307
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,760
You've broken out of the perceptual constant, the size constancy thing.

308
00:35:51,759 --> 00:35:57,520
And then you're getting really what's registering on your retina, little tiny cars and little tiny houses.

309
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:11,880
So, but now the thing I want you to notice is the constancy hypothesis is, he thinks, a mistake of assuming that we got the experience of what our sense organs pick up.

310
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:17,960
The constancy phenomena is his name for what he thinks is right.

311
00:36:18,279 --> 00:36:29,240
That we see things as having constant color, shape, size, and so forth, even though we can pick them up, we pick them up in all sorts of incomplete and distorted ways.

312
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:29,799
I don't know.

313
00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:32,440
It took me years not to get confused about that.

314
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:46,039
You've just got to remember, just bear in mind the constancy hypothesis is bad, and that constancy phenomena is the Gestalt's answer to the constancy hypothesis.

315
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:54,600
It tells you that the constant hypothesis says there's some kind of direct correlation between what the sense organs are picking up and your experience.

316
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,119
The constancy phenomena says, no, there isn't.

317
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:06,920
That you experience stable objects with stable sizes, not what your sense organs are picking up.

318
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:09,960
And, okay, he must take them.

319
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:10,520
Yeah.

320
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,759
So the reason I constantly see it, something that does follow you?

321
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:16,839
Exactly.

322
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:20,040
A camera has got the constancy hypothesis.

323
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,720
So let me give you another example.

324
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:25,639
He doesn't use this one, but he could.

325
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:38,880
You think that, well, he does say, notice that when you've been outside in what looks like normal light, and you come into, well, or you look in through the window.

326
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:45,159
Let's think of a snowy evening, and you look in through the window, and the room inside looks all yellow and orange.

327
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:51,519
And then when you get inside, then it looks like the room's got normal light, and outside it looks all bluish.

328
00:37:52,239 --> 00:38:08,960
That's because the constancy story is the room that you are in, you see as having a constant normal color.

329
00:38:09,279 --> 00:38:14,800
And but I made it more complicated for myself.

330
00:38:14,799 --> 00:38:31,840
But when you look out of that room into some other outside, for instance, then you're outside of the constancy, like when you look at the tiny cars, and the fact that there's bluish light coming from out there makes it look bluish out there.

331
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,000
So constancies could break down.

332
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,919
But normally, you don't even notice that the color of the light is changing.

333
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,439
The constancy phenomena fixes it.

334
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,639
I forgot what I was, I made it more complicated.

335
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:50,159
My version is simple.

336
00:38:50,560 --> 00:39:00,320
In the old days, when you had coat of color film and coat of chrome film, it said on the box, don't take pictures within an hour of sunset.

337
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:01,440
And why?

338
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,119
Because if you did, they all turned out to be all orangey.

339
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:10,400
Because you didn't notice that the light had changed, because your color constancy fixed it.

340
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:16,319
But the camera, again, I'm still talking to him, but you see the point, the camera hasn't got the color constancy.

341
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:19,440
I think by now sophisticated digital cameras do.

342
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,280
I think you can take a picture within an hour of sunset and it still looks normal.

343
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:39,560
But the old, old, just plain film was being just like the retina with a lens in front of it, and it exactly had the constancy, the constancy hypothesis was right about it.

344
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:45,880
But when you turn that into a story about your experience, the constancy hypothesis becomes wrong.

345
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:54,200
Because within the limits of the perceptual constants, you don't experience what's happening in your eye.

346
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,639
And that's what that distinction is trying to tell you.

347
00:39:57,639 --> 00:39:58,040
Yeah?

348
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:04,919
Can you say anything more about what you mean when you say we experience constancy phenomena directly?

349
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:12,199
Because the idea that constancy can break down there's some kind of deviation happening at some level.

350
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:12,520
I think.

351
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,239
Okay.

352
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,080
What happens to the constants when the constancy?

353
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:23,320
I think these are all the right good questions.

354
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:26,359
Let's take Aladis first because I find that easier.

355
00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:40,360
It seems to me that what happens when the constants break down is your experience of truth of the constancy hypothesis becomes true.

356
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:50,600
Your experience is directly correlated with the frequency of light and the size of the object as it is on your retina.

357
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,239
Is that because you're investing age toward the world?

358
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:58,119
Yes, it's like no, I don't think so.

359
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:00,439
Although I maybe have to think about that.

360
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,839
No, I don't think so.

361
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:03,399
I don't think so.

362
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,600
Let's just figure it out.

363
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:09,399
No, because when the sun gets low enough, you experience it orange.

364
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:21,199
I mean, even your constancy hypothesis is the story breaks down and you get, say, often, at least, say, half an hour before sunset, everything starts looking oranger.

365
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,760
Yeah, that's not because you're less engaged.

366
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:25,759
I see why you might think so from the airplane.

367
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:34,000
It looks like when you're not on the ground anymore dealing with these objects, but you're way up there contemplating them, your constancy story breaks down.

368
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,520
But I don't think that's right.

369
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:45,520
Because if you're just on the top of a building and not engaged with the cars on the street, the normal side of the building, not the Empire State Building, they don't go wrong.

370
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,679
It isn't a question of engaged, disengagement.

371
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:49,439
Well, don't add me another one yet.

372
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,480
I'm not going to add the word.

373
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:51,519
Okay, okay.

374
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:56,080
So I have a friend who's like, and I've never been bigger at hypothesis, right?

375
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:05,840
Like, you can see the exact colors, shading differences, and gradients as they move along, you know, shadows and stuff like that.

376
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:07,200
I could see that.

377
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:13,119
I think this is kind of like what we're talking about with the whole phenomenon versus hypothesis.

378
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:18,400
Like, you can see like the camera sees all the different actual light changes and color changes.

379
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,679
Or I'm just saying, like, what's the direct object of my perception?

380
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,959
Wait, yeah, you could do that.

381
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,079
This is related to the Seison Doubt article.

382
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:39,919
One thing you could do as an artist is see things as always breaking down the constants, as always from the point of view of the constancy hypothesis.

383
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:53,199
For instance, when Monet paints the Roulen Cathedral, I don't know if you've seen this, at all hours of the day, from morning till night, he paints it reddish and he paints it whitish and he paints it gray and so forth.

384
00:42:53,199 --> 00:43:00,799
He's learned to see, like your artist friends, the color experience without constant.

385
00:43:00,799 --> 00:43:02,440
That's what the impressionist would do.

386
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,759
But and that can you can do that.

387
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:12,680
Now that's you get into a very, very special detached attitude, not just any old detached attitude, because I can be passionate about this.

388
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:14,600
You've got to be trained to do it.

389
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,959
And then you can see it.

390
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:20,359
You can see what your sense are, what your eyes are picking up.

391
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:20,520
Right.

392
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:28,440
I guess what I was going to do is like, I don't think neither of us he can see by way of the constant phenomenon as well.

393
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,879
Like that's how he deals with the world.

394
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,879
He can, you know, kind of change it over.

395
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:32,839
That's right, of course, yeah.

396
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:39,719
So none of us are like less engaged or anything like that, but he has the ability to be able to see like the cameras can see.

397
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,839
Yeah, that's right.

398
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:43,560
And that's what the impressionists were trying to do.

399
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:58,359
And Cézanne said he didn't want to do that, that he wanted to think objects the way they really look, but not also the Renaissance people tried to think objects as they look, but they trained them as completely determinate perspective when he finished.

400
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:05,319
He wanted to explain how we experience objects in their coming to look.

401
00:44:05,319 --> 00:44:06,359
Yeah, you'll see.

402
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,480
But let me s say something about Alda's question still.

403
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:22,840
I think it's good and I haven't answered it, which is, how does Merrill Pomosi think of this business of when the perceptual constant breaks down and you're left seeing why does that happen?

404
00:44:22,839 --> 00:44:23,639
I don't know.

405
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:24,759
I don't think he knows.

406
00:44:24,759 --> 00:44:26,520
I don't think the Gestaltists know.

407
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:30,679
I mean, the people who have an opinion about this are the Gestalt people.

408
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:35,720
They're the ones who got the constants and the notion that, of course, they also break down.

409
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:40,600
Does anybody know enough Gestalt psychology to tell me what their view of why they break down?

410
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,080
Yeah.

411
00:44:41,799 --> 00:44:42,439
Wait, wait.

412
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:43,719
Okay.

413
00:44:44,279 --> 00:44:45,799
Don't talk out there, please.

414
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,600
I can't hear you.

415
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:46,839
Go ahead.

416
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,960
It's not a question of mediation.

417
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,040
It's a question of fundamental change in the structure of structural virus.

418
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:54,000
So, what J.J.

419
00:44:54,080 --> 00:45:02,880
Gibson would say, or even with the science stuff, what's changed is somehow the relationship of different objects and colors to each other.

420
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:25,279
So, the principle on the fiction science table that we're perceiving on the table when you're trying to look at the color of a cloud paper on a brown table is not a question of the change in constancy that you see have to do with changes in the structure of light, in the opposite array, it has to deal with the color of what are the invariants that are still invariant.

421
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:31,040
While there were some fundamental changes in mobility, previously invariant, it's not now variants.

422
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:44,159
That sounds, I see what you mean, sort of, but we have to talk about this because it's always been varying, and somehow we've been able to pick up the invariants.

423
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,719
I see what you're talking about here, Gibson.

424
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:55,440
And now there are no invariants for the perceptual system to pick up because the plane is too high or the light has gone too far in some direction.

425
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:08,000
And when we haven't got in the stimulus the kind of invariants that the Gestalt people understood we could pick up, then we have to fall back on what we got on the retina.

426
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:38,199
I think what Conis would say about that is, and I think his actually does his plane example: is that if human beings do not have bodies that were geared for perceiving from high altitudes looking down, that is not on normal, in terms of the background, you want to way of perceiving from the body's point of view, that's not something that's either a socially acquired way of perceiving that's complete model, nor is it an evolutionary denominator that human needs perceive.

427
00:46:38,759 --> 00:46:43,480
There's certain ways you can stress these things out that in fact get these kind of breakdowns.

428
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,199
It's funny.

429
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:51,000
This is, I mean, do your own phenomenology the next time you get a plane trip, because it can't just be the angle.

430
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,759
Because for a while, while you're looking down, it's still okay.

431
00:46:54,759 --> 00:47:01,400
Like it would look if you were on top of barrows looking down, you could definitely see the car as the normal size.

432
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,199
It's a combination, and that might make Gibson happy.

433
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:14,439
A certain combination of the looking down and the lack of detail maybe that you get from at a certain distance together will give it to you.

434
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:28,920
But anyway, the basic point is, I think they argue one should say that it's a job of psychologists to figure out what keeps the input, what invariants in the input make us able to see the constants.

435
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:35,320
And they can make experiments, which they do, where you change those and you lose the constants.

436
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:39,319
And I'm sure there must be books about this, but I don't know them.

437
00:47:39,319 --> 00:47:41,319
But is that any help?

438
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:56,840
Well, I thought that you mentioned the constant phenomena was part of a motivation of the idea that active engagement or active coping of good violence is important.

439
00:47:56,839 --> 00:48:04,679
But it now sounds as if there's no connection between active engagement and deep livering with the explanation of what we sometimes have constantly, sometimes doesn't.

440
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,159
So I wonder whether it is important.

441
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,920
Uh-huh.

442
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:24,320
I it seems that moving through the field, that's a Gibson-like thing, is important, which is different than whether you're moving through the field engaged or detached.

443
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,839
It's then you'd you'd be happy with that.

444
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:26,879
I mean move, wouldn't you?

445
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,800
Moving is the crucial thing.

446
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:35,520
Your attitude of whether you're engaged or detached doesn't seem to be the crucial factor.

447
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,959
So now it comes back to me.

448
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,800
Why am I making a fuss about engaged or detached?

449
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:47,600
And saying, you know, the husseral is detached, and then you get the wrong answer.

450
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,359
Let me switch to that.

451
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:51,679
I guess I put your question on hold.

452
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,360
There's too many questions.

453
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:53,839
Keep it.

454
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:55,439
You would start with it next time.

455
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,320
Okay, because I want to say something about this interesting issue about engaged and detached.

456
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:14,879
And the best way to see what's at stake is something like how to put it.

457
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,880
Well, I don't know where this is going to lead, but I'll have to start where I am and see where it leads.

458
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:52,119
I mean, the extremist, wrong-headed way of looking at this, is let's start with that, is to think that when you are introspecting in a completely detached this is where I sort of what I was going to say when I if I come across it in the course of the lecture is the the wrongest way to think about what phenomenology is is to think that it's the same kind of thing you get when you meditate because then you are totally aware of your experience.

459
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:55,959
And after all, that's what the phenomenologist ought to be, is aware of their experience.

460
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:01,359
And you discover amazing things that you don't have any stable self, there are not any stable objects, and so forth.

461
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:05,719
How anybody know Varela, Roche Evan Thompson book?

462
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:10,840
Well, that's an extremely interesting example of the total mistake in this direction.

463
00:50:11,319 --> 00:50:17,240
Varela thinks that he's got, he's telling us what Meryl-Ponty should be doing.

464
00:50:17,239 --> 00:50:25,400
And the real important empirical investigation about what a self is and what objects are and so forth is arrived at through meditation.

465
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,439
Well, that's completely wrong-headed.

466
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:47,400
From a Meryl-Ponty point of view, that may tell you something interesting about what happens to your brain when you detach it and detune it from the world, but it certainly doesn't tell you what it's like to experience having a self and having objects and coping with them.

467
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:59,320
Meryloponty thinks, I think, that there are just two long ways of trying to find out about our most basic experience.

468
00:50:59,319 --> 00:51:13,560
One would be to be completely subjective and turn in and meditation, and whatever you found there wouldn't be illuminating about your normal engagement with the world.

469
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:16,600
The other would be, that's the subject side.

470
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:20,600
The object side would be just to stare at things and describe them.

471
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:30,840
That also, and that might be your impressionist story, that wouldn't tell you about your direct engagement with the world.

472
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:34,760
And why should you be concerned about your direct engagement with the world?

473
00:51:34,759 --> 00:52:04,320
Because, and this is the crucial thing, it's on not only is it our normal position to be actively moving around, coping with things, but uh it's that which is the background of everything else I mean you can you can be subjective and you can be objective but always on the basis of your general experience of objects in the world that you have when you are dealing with them.

474
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:08,159
And I think really, I'm just trying to put this to extreme, I think I just want to give you a feel for this.

475
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:13,920
I think really, as somebody once said to me, the phenomenology of perception is really a book about sports.

476
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,600
Why is it a book about sports?

477
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:25,840
Because that really says if you want to understand people's relation to the world at its best, then you ought to look at what an athlete in flow is finding.

478
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:33,840
An athlete in flow isn't finding that they've got a subject itself with inner states that they can contemplate it in meditation.

479
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:41,600
And it isn't finding that there's some object over there opposite them which they can contemplate the properties of.

480
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:49,360
Whatever it is that an athlete in flow is experiencing, it's something that is not like subjects and not like objects.

481
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:58,480
But it's this business of being in the world where that hyphens, where you are totally engaged in the situation.

482
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:07,040
The way Merle Ponty puts it at one point is that Descartes has got us stuck with the two kinds of being ontology.

483
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:12,639
There's the being of subjects and their inner states, and there's the being of objects and their properties.

484
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:14,879
And we need a third kind of being.

485
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:20,159
And the third kind of being is really the being of athletes in flow, if you want to put it that way.

486
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:23,760
It's the being absorbed in dealing with the world.

487
00:53:23,759 --> 00:53:30,560
And that's supposed to be us exercising our perceptual capacities at their best.

488
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:37,000
And that's why the phenomenologist wants to study that.

489
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:46,759
And why the phenomenologist has, so to speak, from the phenomenologist's point of view, the right to say that what you discover in meditation is like breakdown.

490
00:53:46,759 --> 00:53:50,839
It's like detuning your television set and seeing a lot of static on the screen.

491
00:53:50,839 --> 00:53:56,680
You can do it, and the static will tell you something about how television sets work and the pictures weren't real.

492
00:53:56,679 --> 00:53:59,320
But it's a breakdown situation.

493
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:01,639
And the same as you just sit and stare at objects.

494
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:03,239
That's a breakdown situation.

495
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:14,119
If you want to understand what perception is like, you ought to understand what it's like when human beings are behaving at their optimal relation to the world.

496
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,920
And that's what it's going to do.

497
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,479
Now, I've got to stop.

498
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,080
Let me hear your question again.

499
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,679
I don't think I'm going to be able to answer it in one minute.

500
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:26,439
Okay.

501
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,679
Yeah, we directly, yeah, let me try.

502
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:29,639
Give me one more minute.

503
00:54:29,719 --> 00:54:30,600
I've got the challenge.

504
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:38,040
He's asking you, why do I say we directly experience objects with color constancy, size constancy, and so forth?

505
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:48,039
Clearly, there's a lot of processing going on in the brain, and there's a lot going on, too, in the visual hoping.

506
00:54:49,319 --> 00:55:12,839
Directly is meant, and this is the first approximation, directly is meant to be the opposite of that there is some kind of processing that intervenes between the experience of what is on your retina and the experience you have of the world.

507
00:55:13,159 --> 00:55:16,520
You, I'm still, I'm not sure I can do this, let's see.

508
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,439
This isn't going to work, but I'll just say it.

509
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:45,119
If you want to describe again the phenomena of us at our best, if that's what your job is, as the phenomenologist's job is, then the fact that there's other, on the level of the brain, there's lots of processing going on, is not incompatible with the experience that I am just an open head turned towards the world.

510
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:58,880
What you want to get rid of is some kind of notion of sense data or representation or anything like that, on the basis of which you have to do some mental work in order to get the experience of the world.

511
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:11,839
There isn't any, of course the brain's doing lots of work, but there isn't any phenomena that on the basis of which you then produce this stable experience of the world.

512
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:41,520
This is a good transition because what you're going to read about now is the view of sensation and association and how, if you don't get this direct story, what it is that people try to propose that mediates between what the constancy hypothesis says they've got in their experience and what the result is.

513
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:47,440
And he's going to try to show, this is my last attempt, all these mediating stories don't work.

514
00:56:47,440 --> 00:57:03,079
You've just got to leave it on the one level to the brain doing it however the brain does it, but on the phenomenological level, there's no story more basic than that you are opening your eyes and seeing directly stable objects with constant properties.

515
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:06,359
I don't that's more like a a promise than an argument.

516
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:07,159
But that's the best I can do.
