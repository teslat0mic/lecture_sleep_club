1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,241
The two questions are the basis of intersubjectivity.

2
00:00:04,241 --> 00:00:31,040
How we ever get open to other beings, other human beings, as independent human beings and react to them in terms of them as other, I don't even know how to say it, minimally, somehow uh demanding a kind of response from us that that natural things don't.

3
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,641
So we're going to talk about that.

4
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:50,200
And then the other one, I think it's a really interesting issue that I was on the edge of my seat wondering how he's going to figure it out, is how he's going to get together the fact that we see the world from a perspective, but we are all it's always the same world that we see.

5
00:00:50,201 --> 00:00:52,201
We don't get caught in our perspective.

6
00:00:52,201 --> 00:01:03,241
The way I would put it is, the second issue is the priority of the world to my world, where you try to keep my world somehow into this story too.

7
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:13,880
And they keep flipping over back and forth, the dialectic goes on and on between my world and the world for the second half of the chapter until it ends in total obscurity, I think.

8
00:01:14,201 --> 00:01:17,160
But I know what he wants, and I could be right.

9
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,920
He wants somehow to keep hold of both.

10
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:27,400
That is, somehow we have our own, each of us has our own perspective on one shared world.

11
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,521
Now, here we are, ready to start.

12
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:40,201
So the first thing is that we want to, why have I got this?

13
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,041
It's already in serious other mindset.

14
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,481
Let me look at four things.

15
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:47,961
Oh, yes, Defici could.

16
00:01:47,961 --> 00:01:51,400
But it turns out to be this is such a disorganized thing.

17
00:01:52,201 --> 00:01:57,560
He launches out into a criticism of objective thought at the bottom.

18
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:04,120
But I wanted you to notice that it's tell you, as I always try to, that it's, oh, I want to just start.

19
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:05,961
Let me talk about confusion.

20
00:02:05,961 --> 00:02:10,201
I wanted to do one thing first, which is sort of separate, so I just want to get it out of the way.

21
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:33,280
Something he says at the top of 405, which because this issue keeps coming up in office hours, that I, even if I walk down the street, the students who seem to me sometimes to be strangers come up and worry about my view that the natural object is somehow prior to and more basic and the grip we get on it.

22
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:43,361
The grip we get on it is non-task dependent, and the object we get a grip on is some kind of natural object that is prior to social and culture.

23
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:44,880
We've gone through it again and again.

24
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:47,201
I just wanted to show you on 105.

25
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:48,560
He says it again.

26
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:55,600
And I'm going to tell you what I think it means in a way that's become clearer in discussions in office hours maybe than I was before.

27
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,480
About four lines down on 405.

28
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:09,360
And every object will be in the first place and in some respect a natural object made up of colors, tactile, and auditory qualities insofar as it's destined to enter my life.

29
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:17,681
What I want to talk about is that first, obviously there's this natural object, the top of 405, which we perceive.

30
00:03:18,001 --> 00:03:20,720
If you're in a different book, who's got the concordance this time?

31
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,121
Anybody?

32
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,321
Alva, you should.

33
00:03:22,321 --> 00:03:23,840
Okay, just the end of a paragraph.

34
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,881
The next paragraph right after is just as nature fine.

35
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:28,240
Very top of 405.

36
00:03:28,801 --> 00:03:29,681
347.

37
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:30,881
347.

38
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:39,921
Okay, so right before that new paragraph, every object will be in the first place, in some respect, a natural object.

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:04:03,680
I don't know what the in some respect is, but I think I understand what in the first place it is and why it bothers people when I say it, because it doesn't mean that genetically we first experience natural objects before we experience them relative to our interests or relative to our culture or as equipment or whatever.

40
00:04:03,681 --> 00:04:06,441
That can't be what he wants to say.

41
00:04:04,641 --> 00:04:08,840
It isn't genetically first.

42
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,321
What is it then?

43
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:15,720
Well, I think it's what phenomenologists call a founding kind of relation.

44
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,480
That is, you could experience a natural object.

45
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:26,121
You don't very often, but he does talk about how you could do it in the Place de la Concorde if you just stop and stare at a wall.

46
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:37,400
You can experience natural objects without past relative and without culture relative characteristics.

47
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:59,320
But you can't experience cultural relative characteristics and past relative characteristics without a perceptual object there which has its, remember that Sean was talking about, it has its color, its tactileness, it makes its sound when you hit it, and so forth, and so its faith and all that.

48
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:16,360
Those perceptual constants that are in the chapter on the thing in the natural world all have to be there as the properties or characteristics of an object before you can have these higher order of things, like past relative and culture relative.

49
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:40,600
I just thought I, I mean, I now think that's a sensible thing to say, and I think it maybe gets rid of people's feelings that I go around thinking, and I do really, but I shouldn't, that we just have this kind of general body schema which gets us into relation with sort of near objects which are just there with their aspects and their colors and shapes and so forth.

50
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,881
It's not like that.

51
00:05:41,881 --> 00:05:48,601
By the time we are conscious and dealing with objects, they've already got a style that goes with our culture.

52
00:05:48,600 --> 00:06:04,321
They already, you know, rattle already something already for a culture where kids are allowed to make noise and it's already got its already in equipment and you can pay attention to some aspect of it task-wise and so forth.

53
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:06,001
Okay, that's all I want to say about that.

54
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:07,280
Is there something puzzling about that?

55
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,000
Alva, yeah.

56
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:29,521
Okay, I'm trying to exclude on the one hand the claim that we start by genetically, either in a culture or in the history of the race or in the history of the individual, these natural objects, and then add cultural predicates and task-relative predicates later.

57
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:32,241
I think that he doesn't want it, he shouldn't have to say that.

58
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,761
I think we get them all at once.

59
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:38,321
Any object you get now, like this book, is going to be task-relative.

60
00:06:38,321 --> 00:06:44,081
You're interested in some page, remember, and there your optimal grip is relative to your task, and so forth.

61
00:06:44,081 --> 00:06:54,320
So I want to say, now I don't want to claim that that's the sense in which the body schema and the natural object are basic.

62
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:57,521
So that's why I'm excluding the priority of that.

63
00:06:57,521 --> 00:07:05,841
I want to say, but I want to exclude, on the other hand, a kind of constructivism, maybe I never made that clear, which says there's nothing basic at all.

64
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:15,041
I mean, once you see that it's permeated with culture and task relativity, you see that there isn't any and there never was any natural object at all.

65
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,041
That's what I was resisting.

66
00:07:18,161 --> 00:07:41,880
There is still some sense in which there is a level of natural object, which according to Merlowe Pointillan seems right to me, and a level of the body schema, which is, of course, the thing latches onto it and is the key to unlocking it, that there is that level, and that level is, in some sense, what's the word prior here?

67
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,761
I've actually gotten the word I was talking all about.

68
00:07:47,081 --> 00:07:48,761
In the first place.

69
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,681
And every object will be in the first place.

70
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,601
I'm just trying to explain first place.

71
00:07:52,600 --> 00:08:03,881
That if there is a natural object, it isn't cultural all the way down, but it isn't as if the natural object ever shows up as independent or needs to.

72
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,081
That's what I'm trying to say.

73
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,921
Want any better?

74
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:18,921
He wants that it's not cultural all the way down, but that the better is experienced independently of the cultural object.

75
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:19,561
That's right.

76
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:27,081
Although I never seems to be too strong because he gives this example of staring at the wall in the classical concord.

77
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:40,681
It could be, there's nothing in principle against you're latching on with your body schema to the natural object which is not equipment, it's lost its cultural style, you're just staring at it and haven't got any task in mind.

78
00:08:40,681 --> 00:08:41,400
You can do it.

79
00:08:41,401 --> 00:08:45,481
There's a painter whose name I've been trying to find, which somebody once gave a lecture on.

80
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:52,761
I know who, so I have to just call it, who's apparently made it his life's work to try to paint objects as mere objects.

81
00:08:52,760 --> 00:09:01,720
And they're sort of weird and their color is sort of vague and it's clear that they've got some kind of shape, but it's not very this very specific and so forth.

82
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,321
And I think that's a real experience.

83
00:09:03,321 --> 00:09:09,081
I think this is the sort of seismic of mere objects that they're trying to kind of put it on his canvas.

84
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:37,041
I'm wondering whether you're the moving to this light with the thought that in some sense the natural properties are something that's more real for more crazy, not in an experiential sense, because they owe their nature to nature, whereas the other properties only show up against the cultural background, the absence of work.

85
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,520
Well, that's what I think about this founding thing.

86
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:48,240
Yes, there's a level of nature, and the nature is something that our body schema has, I would say, evolved to be exactly in tune with.

87
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,360
I mean, he never, I guess, evolutionary kind of thinking wasn't in the game then.

88
00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:08,481
But anyway, there is this natural us, and we've got this natural body schema, and it's linked, it's in sync with these natural objects, and that can be independent of everything, of all these other levels.

89
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,120
That's the sense in which it's in the first place.

90
00:10:13,441 --> 00:10:22,881
But it almost practically never experienced it, and that's all right, because it's always already transformed by all these overlays.

91
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,120
But it's never transformed away.

92
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,840
That would be the other mistake, that it's culturally so determined that there isn't any natural object in it.

93
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:40,001
You need to feel the cultural background to understand the experience of the cultural properties.

94
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:40,800
That's what I would say.

95
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:46,401
And then the idea is that the body schema is itself not conditioned by culture.

96
00:10:46,401 --> 00:10:48,161
Well, is that culture independent?

97
00:10:48,161 --> 00:10:49,441
That's a good question.

98
00:10:50,081 --> 00:11:10,441
I would have thought that it was the same as the object, that it could be independent, that it is a level, it doesn't require culture and it doesn't require tasks, but that once you've got a culture and a task, that ought to be get into your body schema just the way it gets into the way the object shows up.

99
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,921
They ought to become a complete Corellium.

100
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:13,481
Yeah.

101
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,360
Well, yes, she's right.

102
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,801
I mean, if the culture, she could put it this way, but it's what she said.

103
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:31,480
The cultural schema is innate, whereas whatever else comes along is based upon our habits.

104
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,120
It's true that there is the innate part and the acquired part.

105
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,041
And of course, obviously, the cultural part's got to be acquired.

106
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:43,161
It couldn't be innate because it's different for all these different people.

107
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:59,001
And it's, and if you want to use the body schema, and you should probably, as the innate, already, always already given a history that has a prehistory, all these funny ways he talks about it, and the inborn complex, weird things he says.

108
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,481
If you want to find this, then you find it, then you better call that the body schema.

109
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:26,681
So I'll take back the idea that the body schema gets changed, but what you get to is a lot more body sets than this original body schema, where you're set to see all sorts of cultural things, stylistic things, and they go together on the side of the object, and they go together in the intentional arc.

110
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:43,001
That is, the world that showed up, that might show up, in principle could show up, as mirror, mirror, he loves them, so I call them mirrors, as objects with all kinds of wonderful inter-synergistic, inter-sensorial properties.

111
00:12:43,321 --> 00:12:51,761
That world, which is a product of the intentional arc, because it shows up for me because of my body schema.

112
00:12:51,760 --> 00:13:00,241
Thanks to the intentional arc, not only does all this other stuff get added to the body schema, but of course all of this other stuff gets added to the world.

113
00:13:00,561 --> 00:13:02,721
It shows up in our world.

114
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,720
That to talk about as P.I.J.

115
00:13:04,801 --> 00:13:07,041
does, that Rick mentions every once in a while.

116
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:13,281
Mailboxes show up as mailboxes, and they show up as four mailing letters, and they look like that.

117
00:13:13,281 --> 00:13:19,361
And that's all I that just shows that there's a lot added to the original schema, to that good word.

118
00:13:19,681 --> 00:13:21,201
You don't need any more.

119
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:21,920
Oh, yeah.

120
00:13:21,921 --> 00:13:22,401
Yeah.

121
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:23,281
Did I say that?

122
00:13:23,281 --> 00:13:23,921
It could be.

123
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,081
I know I meant Gibson.

124
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,161
Oh, really?

125
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,440
Gibson takes you over.

126
00:13:31,681 --> 00:13:32,321
Okay.

127
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:33,921
Yeah.

128
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,561
It's not engineering.

129
00:13:39,921 --> 00:13:45,600
I don't want to say that the personal discovery are disrupted.

130
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,481
Is it what?

131
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,441
Disruption.

132
00:13:47,441 --> 00:13:48,321
Disruption.

133
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:49,600
No, I don't think it's.

134
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,000
I want to resist that.

135
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,201
Absolutely resist that.

136
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:54,401
Does he say that somewhere?

137
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:55,440
Well, let's find it.

138
00:13:55,441 --> 00:13:56,480
Good if you're quoting.

139
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,961
But let me say, well, I'll resist it first, but then I'll be shot down.

140
00:13:58,961 --> 00:14:00,961
At least he'll know what's happened.

141
00:14:00,961 --> 00:14:15,281
I mean, I want to say that what's built into the body innate and the objects with their kind of, we call it, lost the word for a minute, stable, but that's not the word I'm looking for.

142
00:14:15,681 --> 00:14:28,161
The properties like the constant, the constant properties that objects have of size and shape and remember and keep telling yourself this and color and texture and so forth.

143
00:14:28,161 --> 00:16:06,401
That, I'd be very surprised, but I'm ready to be surprised, that that would ever be disrupted by what the tasks we had the kind of equipment we had the cultural style we had why would that disrupt it instead of add to it now tell me where he says the other 85 38 by the way I can't I might forget so let me say right now my example would be how many seen the gods must be crazy okay well I'm thinking I'm on the side of the coke bot that is I take it that those natives who never saw anything like the coke bottle saw a green cylindrical solid thing which they then had to figure out why the gods dropped it into their world from nowhere but they didn't it didn't it and they didn't and when they did it didn't disrupt it it just they finally thought it was for rolling things and for hitting people and so forth uh okay now yeah didn't they first you and what you just said didn't they first see something that's all from the gods and not just the nearby property about it before that's interesting i guess i want to say to that i don't think that that was the way things look uh that that it did or i want to say i don't know which we don't have to we have to interview maybe it did look like it fell from the gods so we want to say that's added on to the coke bottle shape but then my example is gone i was hoping it was a a natural object that fell rick's got me there maybe you have to where's the 385 okay for those who want to know the other pages when we're 330 right before the new paragraph?

144
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,321
Okay, I'll read it to myself.

145
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,921
Everybody reads it to themselves, starting with the natural world is the horizon.

146
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:14,161
I think that's what i said.

147
00:16:14,161 --> 00:16:25,921
If they're given unity underlying all the disruptions of my personal life and historical life, that doesn't mean a unity disrupted by my personal historical life.

148
00:16:25,921 --> 00:16:27,600
It says exactly what I said.

149
00:16:27,601 --> 00:16:30,881
There's this unity which that's a I love it.

150
00:16:30,881 --> 00:16:34,320
I mean, that's the founding relation I'm trying to talk about, isn't it?

151
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,961
I mean, it doesn't say it gets changed by the disruptions of my personal life.

152
00:16:39,361 --> 00:16:48,881
Maybe the next sentence, 10 minutes, we're given general pre-personal existence of my sensory functions, which would just, that's exactly what I was saying.

153
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:50,800
I mean, your sensory functions don't change.

154
00:16:50,800 --> 00:17:08,561
Your eyes do what they did, your hands and all of them, your ears, and it stays there as a pre-personal that would certainly be task-free and I think culture-free, something or other, no matter what happens.

155
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,841
It underlies them.

156
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,320
Why do you think it says the opposite?

157
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:12,720
Anyway.

158
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,000
What I mean of that is that I don't see anything about disrupt the disruptions.

159
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,441
I see, well, I see you mean, I see how you're reading it now.

160
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:28,961
A unity underlying in spite of the way my personal and historical life disrupts it.

161
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:36,720
Well, even then, whatever that would mean, the unity stays there underlying it, the way the sentence is.

162
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:43,120
I mean, whatever disruptions there are, they don't change the constants.

163
00:17:43,921 --> 00:17:47,680
We have to think of an example of what it would what would you think what are you thinking of?

164
00:17:47,681 --> 00:17:48,480
What would disrupt it?

165
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,160
We're back to the Torah and the sacred baby.

166
00:17:50,641 --> 00:18:01,601
Something somebody declares it sacred, and that even I, my picture is, yeah, it's sacred, that'll do funny things to your maximal grip and where you're going to stand, but it doesn't.

167
00:18:01,601 --> 00:18:08,840
It still keeps a constant color, constant shape, constant weight, constant size, and so forth and so forth.

168
00:18:08,841 --> 00:18:10,921
And nothing can disrupt that.

169
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:12,041
That's what I think.

170
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,400
And this passage doesn't change my mind about it.

171
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,840
And I like the idea of underlying that's the sense of first.

172
00:18:20,841 --> 00:18:31,161
I mean, not first, not first in the tempered genetically first, but always there with a certain peculiar kind of priority, which I will repeat one last time.

173
00:18:31,161 --> 00:18:43,961
You can have that level without any of these disruptions from these higher levels, but you can't have any of the personal and historical levels if you didn't have already the pre-personal thing.

174
00:18:43,961 --> 00:18:44,281
Yeah.

175
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,761
I'll just give it a way of thinking about natural audience.

176
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:57,160
Is there a way of thinking about yourself as a natural self which steps on and extends away from raising your gender, your nationality, all these things?

177
00:18:57,881 --> 00:18:59,240
Yeah, I think there is.

178
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,400
And I think it's relevant to this chapter.

179
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:06,520
It's probably one of the many balls in the air in this chapter which I can't keep track of.

180
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:14,201
The natural self would be the body FEMA, which we share with all human beings, and we perceive in the same way.

181
00:19:14,201 --> 00:19:24,441
And our eyes, you know, we get death in the same way, and we follow brightness attracts us in the same way, and we go to the brightest light, or the light is right to see what we're seeing.

182
00:19:24,441 --> 00:19:32,680
All that stuff, that would be the natural self, which underlies the social self.

183
00:19:32,681 --> 00:19:34,600
I'm sure, I think we know that.

184
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:37,080
And so that's sort of related to this.

185
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:42,600
It's pre-personal, meaning not personal and not historical.

186
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:48,760
And the body, of course, this is also true of the fact that the body has arms and legs.

187
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:57,840
It moves forward more easily than backward, it balances any gravitational field, the kind of things that Samuel Torres is interested in, that we share with all human beings.

188
00:19:57,841 --> 00:20:00,160
That's not the body in the L Ponte.

189
00:20:00,161 --> 00:20:07,121
The body of Heloponte is this schema for inter-translating all of the sensory input.

190
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,640
Okay, Saturday, what you want to say?

191
00:20:10,641 --> 00:20:12,080
I don't think it does anything else.

192
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:20,801
Anything you do is going to be in action, which will be constituted by humanity constituting the body.

193
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,520
It's not.

194
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:32,720
But in some sense, anyways, you can eat or anything that would get you to with your body is not schema.

195
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:36,720
I know, but you know what you mean, like what you were going to be doing.

196
00:20:36,881 --> 00:20:38,081
Good, that's just social.

197
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,560
Yeah.

198
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,401
Okay, so that's all right.

199
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,600
It's not, I see now a new distinction.

200
00:20:43,601 --> 00:20:51,921
It's not that there's some kind of animal thing that your body organism does that's not social, like eat or sex or breathe.

201
00:20:51,921 --> 00:20:53,921
Let's suppose that's all social.

202
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:57,280
That every culture has their own style for doing it.

203
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,640
That's not the issue.

204
00:20:58,641 --> 00:21:15,600
The issue is whether the body schema is pre-personal and not social, and whether the object that it gives you is, remember, no matter how you eat, you've got to eat something that keeps its shape, or at least you do, keeps its shape and size and color and texture and weight.

205
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,121
I could get a list and just hold it up every once in a while.

206
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:21,040
Anyway, I'm glad I brought this up.

207
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,080
I knew that it was a tiny fan of worms that's sitting there in the background.

208
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:32,720
And I don't think we need to bring it up again because it's not, I don't think it's the issue in this chapter.

209
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,760
I think that there are these two other issues, so let's go to them.

210
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,681
Okay, and as I say, I think they're interesting issues.

211
00:21:42,681 --> 00:21:46,201
So we go to 407.

212
00:21:46,520 --> 00:22:04,201
Now, what's happening on 407 is, well, that's why we have to go there, to warn you that it starts being all, at the bottom of 405, he asks the question about how an action of human thought can be grasped in the mode of the one.

213
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:10,600
But that then he sort of drops that and goes on to other things.

214
00:22:10,601 --> 00:22:11,881
I don't want to read all this.

215
00:22:11,881 --> 00:22:17,560
I just want to tell you that 406 is not narrow quantity from five lines down.

216
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,081
You may be getting used to this now.

217
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,000
I should probably take a poll.

218
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,400
Do you realize that it's five lines down?

219
00:22:23,401 --> 00:22:32,121
The reply will at once, once more be that I see a certain meeting made by other men and implements, I interpret their behavior, an analogy with my own.

220
00:22:32,121 --> 00:22:34,040
Do you realize that's not his view?

221
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,441
He doesn't think we interpret other people.

222
00:22:36,441 --> 00:22:38,760
He doesn't think it's a mental activity.

223
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:46,601
He doesn't think that it's, but he do it by analogy, they do that, and if I do that, I'm an increase, so they must be an increase, and so forth.

224
00:22:47,161 --> 00:22:50,520
So that's not narrow-quantity at all.

225
00:22:51,080 --> 00:23:01,641
And then at the bottom, of course, it's still not narrow quantity, because now he's going off to say the existence of other people is a difficulty and outrage for objective thoughts.

226
00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:03,000
And he thinks that.

227
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:14,040
But he then goes on, so that phrase isn't parallel quantity, but then he goes and develops objective thought anyway for all of page 407, which is also not narrow quantity.

228
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,880
Now I need to tell you something else.

229
00:23:15,881 --> 00:23:21,441
How many from some other courts or something know Sartre's talk about being for others and being in time?

230
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:27,921
Well, anyway, who's got Sartre always in the background of this discussion?

231
00:23:27,921 --> 00:23:36,560
If you're going to write on this, for instance, you better leave the section of being in nothingness called being with others or being for others.

232
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:36,961
I forget.

233
00:23:37,121 --> 00:23:39,120
Anybody remember what it's called?

234
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:46,560
And it's also the subject of no exit, but no exit, the ontology started in the background.

235
00:23:47,201 --> 00:23:51,201
And Sartre's got this whole story, which you get in here in clear, condensed form.

236
00:23:51,201 --> 00:23:54,480
Merloponte is very good at summing up other people's views.

237
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:12,801
And the important thing to see is in the middle of 407, that for this person, for this captain who he is really discussing in this chapter without telling you, namely Sartre, there's two modes of being: being in itself, which is being an object, and being for itself, which is being conscious.

238
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,240
You see where that is, right?

239
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,161
Smack in the middle of that page.

240
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:19,921
In the middle from the top to the bottom, and in the middle from the right to the left.

241
00:24:21,201 --> 00:24:24,720
And then there's only two ways of relating to other people.

242
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,720
You need to treat them as objects, or they treat you as an object.

243
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,240
And they're subjects.

244
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,681
And this is the story of no exit, whether they're the sadist.

245
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:40,240
One of them is sadism, and one of them is masochism, according to him.

246
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,681
Saddest wanted to stay for the self and treat everybody else as in itself.

247
00:24:45,681 --> 00:24:49,201
They want to be conscious and free, and that's one kind of being.

248
00:24:49,201 --> 00:24:54,240
And the only way to do it is to make sure that nobody else is conscious and free, treat them as objects.

249
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,320
Or some people, who are masochists, want to be objects, because that's very reassuring to get your property.

250
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,000
So they go around looking for somebody to do it because they treat them as an object.

251
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,961
And those are the only two modes of being, according to Sartre.

252
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,560
A little further down, he says, thus, there is no place for people in a plurality of consciousness in objective thought.

253
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,640
Sartre has now become the objective thought person.

254
00:25:19,641 --> 00:25:23,320
And it stops, and all 407 is Sartre.

255
00:25:23,641 --> 00:25:35,080
And now comes Merlot-Ponty finally, that we have, in fact, learned to shed doubt upon objective thought, and now we're off on Merloponty's own territory.

256
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:49,800
And just to finish this sort of thing, and his ontological answer to Sartre's ontology that there's only two modes of being, be a conscious subject or be a thing object, is to say there's a third mode of being.

257
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,281
That's just a little below the middle of 408.

258
00:25:52,280 --> 00:26:03,000
At the same time, as the body withdraws from the objective world, it forms between the pure subject and the object, a third genus of being.

259
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:29,800
So it's very important that Merlot-Ponty thinks that his notion of the lived body is neither, and you should be used to this now, a lucid, conscious, free, meaning-giving subject, which is Sartre, nor is it to be a body, just a physiological, I mean, an object, a physiological thing that you just study as part of your nexus of causality in the world.

260
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:35,161
It's amazing that this view, just to tell you, how many of you come across Brandon in any of your courses yet?

261
00:26:35,401 --> 00:26:37,720
It isn't as if this view is is gone.

262
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,201
It's just sort of metamorphosized.

263
00:26:40,201 --> 00:26:43,720
I mean, and I Dick Lordy, another one, you've come across Horty.

264
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:52,320
I mean, for Brandon and Ordon, there's only two kinds of being, the being of all kinds of stuff in causal relations with each other.

265
00:26:49,881 --> 00:26:57,120
And now it's no longer the consciousness, but the language using being.

266
00:26:57,681 --> 00:27:00,881
Us as only as pure language users.

267
00:27:00,881 --> 00:27:08,480
So somehow there's these language users who can make inferences and there are these pure things which are in causal relations.

268
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,161
And that's all there is.

269
00:27:10,401 --> 00:27:12,161
That's just a new view of this.

270
00:27:12,161 --> 00:27:17,201
And Merlot Ponty wants to say, no, there's a third kind of being.

271
00:27:17,201 --> 00:27:18,720
It is meaningful.

272
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,961
It has intentionality of a sort.

273
00:27:20,961 --> 00:27:22,640
It's got significance.

274
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:29,040
It's not the mere causal parts outside of parts of being.

275
00:27:29,361 --> 00:27:32,961
But it's not a lucid consciousness either.

276
00:27:32,961 --> 00:27:42,401
It's and Lord wrote me a note lately, this is why it's on my mind in an email saying, there is no other kind of intentionality than linguistic intentionality.

277
00:27:42,401 --> 00:27:49,040
I don't know why you want to go around saying that children and animals and experts have a kind of intentionality.

278
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,961
Well, that's exactly what I want to say and what Merlot Fonty wants to say.

279
00:27:53,760 --> 00:28:05,441
There's a kind of body intentionality which is in this meaningful relation with everything else and is a few words of it is an object.

280
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,161
That's what's going on here.

281
00:28:08,961 --> 00:28:14,640
Pete Debden, a little and why he's saying next and do I want to talk about it?

282
00:28:14,641 --> 00:28:16,161
I don't remember this before.

283
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,281
No, he just takes another hit at the sense data.

284
00:28:21,441 --> 00:28:23,280
We might as well read it right after that.

285
00:28:23,441 --> 00:28:41,480
Objects stand before me and throw this the subject loses its purity and its transparency in this third mode of being because we're meaningful, intentional, coping beings, but we don't have the purity that Sartre attributes to the fore itself.

286
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:47,640
Objects stand before me and throw on my retina a certain projection of themselves, and I perceive them.

287
00:28:47,641 --> 00:28:49,800
That's everybody please to that.

288
00:28:51,641 --> 00:28:58,120
There can no longer be any question of isolating in my physiology representation of the phenomena.

289
00:28:58,121 --> 00:29:05,161
The retinal images and their counterpart form a total field, the actual and possible in which they appear.

290
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,520
Now, why am I reading this?

291
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,961
Why is he saying?

292
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:26,681
The physiological event was merely the abstract schema of the oh, he's saying, yes, he's against some any sort of view in which you can give a kind of mechanistic account of perception.

293
00:29:27,401 --> 00:29:37,080
There is, and that would be some kind of physiological story about how the images hit the retina and then they get up to the central processor and so forth.

294
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,280
That's just not the perceptual event.

295
00:29:40,841 --> 00:29:49,961
And you can't invoke under the name of mental images discontinuous perspective views corresponding to successful retinal images.

296
00:29:49,961 --> 00:30:02,921
He's back again worrying about the view that we have a bunch of perspectives first and then schematized and ready to deal with and then we synthesize them.

297
00:30:02,921 --> 00:30:09,800
I mean, that's the same thing as on 378, but it's always important to see it.

298
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,760
But then now we're going to get into the interesting thing.

299
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:19,760
That he's claiming, I want to come back to the middle of 409 at this time, by the way, just a little.

300
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:23,120
I'm going to signal it so we'll remember to come back to it, or at least you'll notice it.

301
00:30:23,441 --> 00:30:29,921
I'll mention it now, because I think we probably won't come back to it given that we always go into discussions, and that's fine.

302
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,401
Notice the sentence in Middle of 409.

303
00:30:32,401 --> 00:30:41,121
How many have come across Nagel's view that you couldn't possibly have an understanding in third-person form of our first-person experience?

304
00:30:41,601 --> 00:30:42,881
Some of you, I'm sure.

305
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:44,800
Well, there's a Nagel sentence in here.

306
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:59,040
He says, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, exactly half on down in 409, how significance and intentionality could come to dwell in molecular edifices or masses of cells is a thing that can never be made comprehensible.

307
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,360
And here, Cartesianism is right.

308
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:02,320
Wrong.

309
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,520
So there we are.

310
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,040
There's at least this much truth.

311
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:10,161
The first-person perspective can never be reduced to the third-person perspective.

312
00:31:12,401 --> 00:31:28,640
And one more, and following this, a kind of typical narrow-puncture assault on science, it is simply a question of recognizing that the body as a chemical structure or as an agglomeration of tissue is formed by a process of impoverishment.

313
00:31:28,641 --> 00:31:36,480
That's, you've got to get used to him saying about science that it somehow leaves out a lot.

314
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:44,320
And what it talks about somehow isn't as real and isn't as causally basic as what it's explained.

315
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:53,360
I mean, I think that's a, I think, the wrong way to think about science and the wrong way to think about the physical organism.

316
00:31:53,361 --> 00:32:10,040
But he wants to say that insofar as science describes the organism, it's leaving out whatever it is that's really important, namely, that it be the organism already has existence, has being in the world, copes with things.

317
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:16,520
And if you can't explain that, then you have things that you can't explain anything that's important.

318
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:21,801
I'm going to argue in a minute that science explains something very important that Meryl Ponte can't understand.

319
00:32:22,121 --> 00:32:24,120
That's why I want to set this up.

320
00:32:25,161 --> 00:32:26,760
I think he's wrong about this.

321
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,681
Okay, one more preparatory point.

322
00:32:28,681 --> 00:32:31,000
All are running around on 409.

323
00:32:31,401 --> 00:32:37,961
As always, I want to try to see how much he's going to get out of his optimal grip story.

324
00:32:37,961 --> 00:32:56,041
And what he says at the bottom is that what we, through phenomenological reflection, I discover vision, not as a thinking about seeing, to use Descartes' expression, but as a gaze at grips with the visible world, and that's why, for me, there can be another gaze.

325
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:15,881
But all of a sudden, he's given a one-sentence solution to how I can see these objects moving around, you objects moving around, as if you were a conscious, meaningful, intention, entity with intentionality.

326
00:33:15,881 --> 00:33:17,401
And how would I see it?

327
00:33:17,401 --> 00:33:21,480
Well, I just see you coping with things.

328
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:27,801
No, no, no, you don't need optimal grip, but I see you out there trying to get a grip on things.

329
00:33:27,801 --> 00:33:33,480
And that's, and just because I see that, I see intentionality.

330
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:39,321
I see your body already having this kind of purposive activity.

331
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:45,161
And immediately then, I see that you're a special kind of being.

332
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,881
And having defendered.

333
00:33:47,881 --> 00:34:03,601
And on 4.11, we come back to it at the bottom of 4.11, no sooner than has my gaze fallen upon a living body in the process of acting, than the objects surrounding it immediately take on a fresh layer of significance and so forth.

334
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:11,841
That is, they now are understood as what this organism is coping with.

335
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,480
Now, that's as far as he ever gets to this interesting problem.

336
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,720
But I think he comes close enough that we can push him further.

337
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:35,360
The interesting problem is: how is it that I come to recognize other people as other meaningful acting beings like me?

338
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:39,280
And his answer is not by analogy.

339
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,401
That would be this objectivist mistake.

340
00:34:42,401 --> 00:34:49,200
I see them making movements, and I figure if I make those movements, I feel so-and-so, so they must be feeling and thinking so-and-so.

341
00:34:49,520 --> 00:35:01,841
He hasn't got any criticism to make of the equally wrong view I think he would surely hold, which is empathy, that I just have some kind of natural feeling for others.

342
00:35:01,841 --> 00:35:03,281
Well, he's closer to that.

343
00:35:03,281 --> 00:35:04,560
Maybe it's empathy.

344
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:10,321
He talks about how I can just directly see other people's anger and so forth at a certain point.

345
00:35:10,321 --> 00:35:11,680
No, I don't think that's empathy.

346
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:21,441
Empathy is supposedly the view that I have feelings in me and that I then can have a direct sense that you have those feelings in you.

347
00:35:21,441 --> 00:35:23,841
He thinks he's got a third view.

348
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:40,520
When I'm coping in the world, you could see me coping in the world, and I can see you coping in the world, and it's that that we manage to make me able to see you as a being like me, namely with intentionality.

349
00:35:40,841 --> 00:35:42,520
That's what he keeps.

350
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:55,881
That's this, that's the claim with it back here anyway, that you can see the person, you can see this being coming to grips with the world, and when you see that, you see another being like you.

351
00:35:55,881 --> 00:35:57,161
Yeah, Alan.

352
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,801
Um, I was doing so maybe you can just try to identify that.

353
00:36:01,801 --> 00:36:08,520
Um, have you been in yourself, and then you can say other things?

354
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,720
Oh, okay, right, right.

355
00:36:09,721 --> 00:36:10,680
Sorry, I did miss.

356
00:36:10,761 --> 00:36:13,641
But that's just as bad for him, but it's better to get it right.

357
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,360
Yeah, but it's but it's too inner for him.

358
00:36:16,361 --> 00:36:25,081
I mean, it's not a question of finding out to you that other people are also people by understanding their feelings.

359
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:32,040
That for him, I think he would, I don't know whether he'd say that that's impossible wrong or why, but he's not.

360
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,760
He agree is he wrong.

361
00:36:34,921 --> 00:36:45,720
It's not an analogy view, but but I, but he, it makes it, but his view is not an empathy view, I think, because it's because it's not about feelings, it's about acting, he wants to say.

362
00:36:45,721 --> 00:36:46,040
Yeah.

363
00:36:47,241 --> 00:36:50,520
There's an argument in one sentence at the top of 409 that I don't believe.

364
00:36:51,080 --> 00:37:07,000
Myself, in reflecting on perception, the perceiving subject appears to provide with primordial setting in relation to the world, drawing in its train that bodily thing in the absence of which there would be no things, other things for it, then why should other bodies, which I perceive, have similarly, being habitated by consciousness?

365
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:14,240
So the argument seems to take the form of saying having a body is a necessary thing for perceptual consciousness.

366
00:37:14,241 --> 00:37:16,761
That's something we've learned already in the book.

367
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:26,640
But then he seems to go from that to the thought that certain kinds of bodies are therefore sufficient for consciousness at the end of the sentence.

368
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,600
And I don't understand what.

369
00:37:27,841 --> 00:37:29,761
I don't think that's what he's arguing.

370
00:37:29,761 --> 00:37:54,720
That is, all he's trying to argue, set up here is what he's going to kind of call out at the end of the page, that when you understand the kind of bodies we have, then you will understand them as having meaning and purposes, and see them as having, you can see them directly as having meaning and purposes acting in the world.

371
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,680
I don't know.

372
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,320
I can't tell.

373
00:37:56,961 --> 00:37:59,040
I have nothing to say about it further.

374
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,520
Yeah.

375
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:04,801
I'm still not clear on Mello-Ponte's solution, so the argument.

376
00:38:04,961 --> 00:38:06,241
Well, we haven't done it yet.

377
00:38:06,241 --> 00:38:07,040
The solution.

378
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,200
Okay.

379
00:38:09,361 --> 00:38:10,560
It was a fast solution.

380
00:38:10,801 --> 00:38:11,920
We should go over that.

381
00:38:11,921 --> 00:38:14,800
You're not clear about the fast solution that we can just see.

382
00:38:14,801 --> 00:38:28,161
No, then he's got a much more interesting solution when he goes on on the next page on 410 and begins to spell out this solution about grips and gazes.

383
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,761
And then that's when I want to say he's got an interesting issue.

384
00:38:31,761 --> 00:38:35,440
He's got an interesting answer, but in the end he thinks it's miraculous.

385
00:38:35,441 --> 00:38:36,640
We'll talk at 410.

386
00:38:36,721 --> 00:38:46,000
When I turn towards perception and pass from direct perception to thinking about perception, I reenact it, and I find it work in my organs of perception of thinking older than myself.

387
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:54,241
And those organs are merely the trace, of which those organs are merely the trace in the same way I understand the existence of other people.

388
00:38:54,241 --> 00:38:56,160
Now, how is that?

389
00:38:56,801 --> 00:39:02,640
Well, he says, whatever that same way is, and now it's going to take a while to figure out what he's talking about.

390
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,961
It's not a question of analogy.

391
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:16,121
And then he says, and that's because it's more direct, but he doesn't, just to keep the empathy ball in the air, too, he doesn't say it's a question of empathy.

392
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,241
He says it's something much more basic.

393
00:39:19,241 --> 00:39:22,361
And then he says this fascinating thing in the middle of the page.

394
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:31,640
A baby of 15 months opens its mouth as I playfully take one of my fingers between my teeth and pretend to bite it, and so forth.

395
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,401
Well, there's more to this now.

396
00:39:33,401 --> 00:39:37,961
I mean, you know that if you smile at a very, very early baby, I don't know the Tom Daniel.

397
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:38,441
What?

398
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,320
45 minutes, it smiles back.

399
00:39:41,321 --> 00:39:42,920
And how about keeping your tongue out?

400
00:39:42,921 --> 00:39:44,041
About that, too.

401
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,600
Sean tells me, since you know Sean, the funny story, he just had a baby.

402
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,441
So he tried this out, and he stuck his tongue out at the baby.

403
00:39:52,441 --> 00:39:55,800
And lo and behold, then he stuck his tongue out at Sean.

404
00:39:55,801 --> 00:40:00,040
And now every time, for a long time, and ever Sean came into the room, the baby stuck its tongue out.

405
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,480
So there is this.

406
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:08,840
So there is, anyway, this very important fact about kids.

407
00:40:08,841 --> 00:40:09,401
Yeah.

408
00:40:14,361 --> 00:40:24,600
They're reading by analogy, but that the very season, the coffee between early settings, the natural world, and I don't know if you can say.

409
00:40:24,921 --> 00:40:26,040
Well, no, I don't know.

410
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,120
Well, I reenact the alien existence.

411
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,081
Never mind, though.

412
00:40:29,801 --> 00:40:32,520
I don't want to talk, but I don't want to talk about that.

413
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:40,441
I just want to, in order to get cover what I want to cover, I've just got to say, sort of brutally every once in a while, we've got to go on.

414
00:40:40,441 --> 00:40:41,560
I'm sorry, James.

415
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,881
I'm sorry, Sophie, but I'm going to come on.

416
00:40:43,881 --> 00:40:48,761
Okay, so because I'm now, I want to talk about this biting business a little further down.

417
00:40:48,761 --> 00:40:53,281
The biting has immediately for it an intersubjective significance.

418
00:40:53,281 --> 00:41:00,561
It perceives its intentions in its body and my body with its own, and thereby my intentions in its own body.

419
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,681
That's what this is supposed to show.

420
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,841
Well, that seems a bit much to actually claim.

421
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:13,200
All we know is that he knows it's not an allergy because he knows the baby doesn't even.

422
00:41:13,281 --> 00:41:14,401
Let's do the smile.

423
00:41:14,401 --> 00:41:16,560
So you smile and the baby smiles back.

424
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,000
Well, that's strange.

425
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:29,681
How can it know even that it's got a face and a mouth and what muscles to pull to get it to its face which it doesn't know it has and its mouth which it doesn't know it has to do what your face which it's seen it has?

426
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:37,921
It certainly isn't normal kind of understanding of an intersubjective significance.

427
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,800
It's more basic than that.

428
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:46,241
And so later he wants to explain how it's more basic at the bottom of the page.

429
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:47,520
I think he's wrong.

430
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:59,921
But here's between my consciousness and my body as I experience it, between the phenomenon body of mine and that of another as I see it from the outside, there exists an internal relation which causes the other to appear as the completion of the system.

431
00:41:59,921 --> 00:42:06,081
I take that that's supposed to explain the biting and sticking your tongue out and smiling.

432
00:42:06,321 --> 00:42:14,321
The other is evident to me because I am not transparent to myself and because my subjectivity draws its body in its wake.

433
00:42:14,321 --> 00:42:19,041
That seems to me very, very vague, what that's saying.

434
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:31,841
And it wouldn't have seemed vague if it hadn't the neuroscience has actually stumbled on what seems to be the real facts about what's going on here, and that is mirror neurons.

435
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:33,600
And I think it's fascinating.

436
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:47,400
I said I was going to tell you in a minute how Nero Panty is wrong, that science can't tell us anything about this, that just because the brain is a bunch of neurons all and nothing else in their physical things, we can't cast any light on significance.

437
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:48,200
Sure, we can.

438
00:42:48,200 --> 00:43:05,561
The mirror neuron story, if I, if those of you who know more about it, could correct me, is that it's been discovered that there are certain neurons that fire when, what is it, a chimp or kind of monkey sees another pick up something.

439
00:43:05,881 --> 00:43:14,601
Then the neurons that fire for seeing the monkey pick up something are the same neurons that fire when that monkey picks up something.

440
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:26,520
That is, there is an immediate connection between seeing a meaningful action on the part of the monkey and doing that meaningful action.

441
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
It isn't something you figure out.

442
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,761
It isn't something mental.

443
00:43:32,761 --> 00:43:47,480
It's something just wired into the neurons that already interact with the organisms that do these kind of things in a way which picks up that gesture.

444
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:57,801
Now, I don't know why, but there must, I mean, I gather you inhibited most of the time, you who know more about mirror neurons, who don't go around always picking up something when we see somebody pick up something.

445
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:01,321
They think the monkeys, the manhacks have been inhibited, I suppose.

446
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:12,681
If you did the repeated colours hard, the gesture of the other, but that covers up the question.

447
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:19,881
And if there's some neuron that fires when I see it happening, and it's the same neuron that fires when I do it, why don't I do it?

448
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:44,720
And from then on, the stove looked, you know, and there's a you know, I can see the the repul the repulsion of the stove.

449
00:44:44,721 --> 00:44:46,241
And I mean, it seems like a neuron.

450
00:44:46,401 --> 00:44:46,801
Yeah, yeah.

451
00:44:47,441 --> 00:44:49,040
It seems like a mirror-neuron explanation.

452
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,801
That sounds right to me, but that's not the question I'm asking.

453
00:44:53,761 --> 00:44:54,961
Let me give you one second.

454
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,441
Now, well, yes.

455
00:45:01,841 --> 00:45:03,921
And that the mirror neuron wasn't helping you down.

456
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:10,000
If it's the same neuron that fires, when you guys can help me out.

457
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,280
But first, okay, go ahead, Gabriel.

458
00:45:15,441 --> 00:45:18,961
The proparation for doing that there is where the mirror neurons are fired.

459
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,321
Just because mirror neurons are fired, don't even know how to do that.

460
00:45:22,321 --> 00:45:22,961
I think it's a good idea.

461
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:26,401
Okay, so it needs some other contribution from the brain to do it.

462
00:45:26,401 --> 00:45:31,121
My pa my picture of mirror neurons, so I don't know if anybody's written about this, is yawning.

463
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,201
I mean, that's the pure case.

464
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,161
You see somebody yawn and you yawn.

465
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:44,480
And I mean, there I take it, that the shortcut between the see the seeing it and the doing it is really there.

466
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:50,480
But the eye as and I don't know how and maybe for the baby, the tongue's sticking out and the smiling must be like that.

467
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,121
You see somebody doing it, and you do it.

468
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,961
And and and that's that's mirror neurons that they're mirroring us.

469
00:45:56,961 --> 00:46:05,080
And but what I want to say is, Meryl Fonte has no, of course, has no clue about this, so he says these very vague things.

470
00:46:04,801 --> 00:46:09,720
There exists an internal relation which causes the other to appear as the completion of the system.

471
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:13,561
That's supposed to be the baby sticking its tongue out, I presume.

472
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,160
And we're going to just say one thing, Albert.

473
00:46:15,241 --> 00:46:19,401
I want to find out where he tells you it's miraculous on the middle of 412.

474
00:46:19,721 --> 00:46:23,160
Now it is precisely my body who perceives the body of the other.

475
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,200
That's right, all right.

476
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:36,041
I stick my tongue out, and the baby's body perceives my tongue going out and sticks its tongue going out, and discovers in that other body a miraculous prolongation of my own intentions.

477
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:39,640
So I stick my tongue out, and the baby miraculously sticks its tongue out.

478
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,760
It's big deal.

479
00:46:40,761 --> 00:46:42,760
I mean, that's not any help.

480
00:46:42,761 --> 00:46:55,560
But he, I mean, now we can say I stick my tongue out, the baby sees it, the same neurons that enable it to see it are turned on, and with nothing else needed, it automatically does it.

481
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,280
I take it.

482
00:46:56,281 --> 00:46:58,281
I mean, that's supposed to be what's happening.

483
00:46:58,281 --> 00:47:00,681
And that seems like an explanation.

484
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:13,241
It also seems like an idea that maybe you can understand some of the phenomena he wants to understand by understanding what's going on in the brain, which means that the brain isn't just an abstraction that leaves out everything important.

485
00:47:13,241 --> 00:47:17,241
The brain might even be doing some of the things that are important.

486
00:47:17,241 --> 00:47:19,240
So I find that all interesting.

487
00:47:19,241 --> 00:47:20,841
Now, I asked if there was another hand up.

488
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:21,800
Yeah, James.

489
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,041
It's very important in that kind of way.

490
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:29,080
Is it important 409 that thousands of individual intentionality comes as well in a massive cell?

491
00:47:29,961 --> 00:47:30,600
I guess you're right.

492
00:47:30,841 --> 00:47:31,321
You're right.

493
00:47:31,801 --> 00:47:35,000
I realized that, but I didn't say it, so I should have.

494
00:47:35,160 --> 00:48:04,480
Yes, I mean, it the negative question is how consciousness really gets into the cells, that the cells could pick up what that something like the significance of what's going on without it having to pass through the mind or consciousness is seems to me a funny thing that he finds that actually could happen and that he can't understand.

495
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:23,361
We have to talk about this, but I mean, it certainly can't pick up consciousness, and maybe it's too, I see what you're saying, too automatic and too minimal to say that the cells are picking up the significance of my yawning and yawning back, or my tongue going out and going back.

496
00:48:23,361 --> 00:48:26,721
How could cells ever pick up the significance of anything?

497
00:48:26,721 --> 00:48:28,161
And, okay.

498
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,520
Well, there are models.

499
00:48:29,761 --> 00:48:38,881
Walter Freeman comes back in here, of how cells could pick up the significance of something, but it would take a lot more cells and a lot longer story.

500
00:48:38,881 --> 00:48:40,480
I'll buy your point.

501
00:48:40,801 --> 00:48:56,080
Albert introduced something about back in the 60s, New York and Beetle discovered that certain cells had receptive fields, for objects here being certain orientation in the visual field.

502
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:03,280
And I always thought, wow, we can build up some accounts of how we experience physical copies of objects by the cognition of those receptive fields.

503
00:49:03,281 --> 00:49:04,640
That is completely therapy.

504
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,961
There was no such theory in the audience.

505
00:49:06,961 --> 00:49:14,241
All we know now, is that the moment any cells do live, some cells have to change receptive field property with your sense.

506
00:49:14,241 --> 00:49:17,120
If they're showing those things, monkey does that.

507
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,401
We don't know yet.

508
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,361
There's no theory of human minds that makes any sense to dominate.

509
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,881
Well, I'll buy all that.

510
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:37,000
But in the context of whether he owns page 410, he's thinking about this deep story, supposedly, about the baby, and the baby, you know, sticking a pen out of that.

511
00:49:33,921 --> 00:49:41,401
It came from a psychological theory of mutation.

512
00:49:41,961 --> 00:49:44,840
Imitation, all you can say is imitation.

513
00:49:44,841 --> 00:49:48,120
But uranium is what all neuron is playing.

514
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,601
Okay, I'll buy that.

515
00:49:51,160 --> 00:50:00,040
But there must be a brain story about imitation, and it's not going to be there exists an internal relation which causes the other to appear as the completion of a system.

516
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:06,281
Or maybe there is, maybe that sort of sentence is just an empty placeholder for the story.

517
00:50:06,281 --> 00:50:09,881
But the mirror neurons is a little piece of that story.

518
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:10,361
I agree with you.

519
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:14,921
Maybe it isn't even like the Google and Weasel cells never turned out to amount to anything.

520
00:50:14,921 --> 00:50:16,441
I've always, I've been so happy about that.

521
00:50:16,441 --> 00:50:20,520
I from the start who never believed in the Eogle and Weasel pages.

522
00:50:20,921 --> 00:50:21,801
Well, good.

523
00:50:22,841 --> 00:50:23,961
They can work on it.

524
00:50:24,281 --> 00:50:27,161
Let me go back to this because time is getting short.

525
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:34,200
I think all I want to say is, let's see if I've got this, that there is something which Merrill Plantees got onto.

526
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,401
I mean, the phenomena is certainly important.

527
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:41,720
It's you got 129 414.

528
00:50:41,961 --> 00:50:43,401
Now that's a different phenomenon.

529
00:50:43,401 --> 00:50:44,921
I'm getting clear about something.

530
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:45,720
I wasn't clear.

531
00:50:46,441 --> 00:50:50,041
So I talked about 410.

532
00:50:50,361 --> 00:50:51,160
Okay.

533
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,080
Now let's switch.

534
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:57,321
What I want to switch to is what starts on the top of 414.

535
00:50:57,321 --> 00:51:00,761
And that's really on 413.

536
00:51:01,401 --> 00:51:23,680
It's nevermind this business of now a mirror neurons, of the well, as he puts it at the bottom of 412, another attempt to say something, the body image ensures the immediate correspondence of what he sees done and what he himself does, which is a statement of the baby thing again.

537
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,600
Then maybe that's all we can say yet.

538
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,121
We don't know anything more.

539
00:51:28,321 --> 00:51:30,720
But it's probably not going to turn out to be miraculous.

540
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:33,520
It's going to turn out to be a complicated story.

541
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,081
But now I said all I wanted to say about that.

542
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:42,081
The other issue is a much later developmental story on 413.

543
00:51:42,401 --> 00:51:46,400
So remember, on one I said, he sort of waves his hands and he says miraculous.

544
00:51:46,401 --> 00:51:56,080
On this one, he goes on and on worrying about it and saying interesting things until at the end I think he just vanishes in a cloud.

545
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,241
The question is wonderful.

546
00:51:58,241 --> 00:52:07,281
The question, it starts with some research again, which hadn't happened yet, but he's got a kind of version of it.

547
00:52:08,241 --> 00:52:17,921
That is, on 413, two-thirds of the way down, the child lives in a world, the child is on the left margin.

548
00:52:17,921 --> 00:52:22,800
The child lives in a world which he unhesitatingly believes accessible to all around him.

549
00:52:22,801 --> 00:52:32,881
He has no awareness of himself or others as private subjectivities, nor does he suspect that all of us, himself included, are limited to one certain point of view on the world.

550
00:52:32,881 --> 00:52:34,641
Now that's interesting.

551
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,480
Now there's been experiments done.

552
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,320
Children at the age of three begin the following experiment.

553
00:52:42,321 --> 00:52:47,760
This just confirms what Merlot Fonte is saying here, only it's much more dramatic.

554
00:52:48,401 --> 00:53:00,321
There's a box of a kind of candy, and you show the kid, the three-year-old, the box of the kind of candy, and you open it, and lo and behold, it hasn't got candy in it, it's got pencils.

555
00:53:00,321 --> 00:53:08,361
Then you have some adult come into the room, and you ask the child, what does he think is in the box?

556
00:53:08,361 --> 00:53:12,841
And interestingly enough, at the age of three, the child says, pencils.

557
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,280
You see what that means?

558
00:53:14,281 --> 00:53:20,040
That means the child thinks that there's one shared world and we're all open on it and it knows there's pencils.

559
00:53:20,761 --> 00:53:26,520
It's open to the world in which there are pencils, so this other person's open to that same world in which there are pencils in the box.

560
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,680
So that other person knows there's pencils in the box.

561
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:29,801
That's wonderful.

562
00:53:29,801 --> 00:53:33,241
By four, the child doesn't know that.

563
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:37,961
It's funny, the bottom of 413, Narrow Ponchi thinks it's 12 years old.

564
00:53:37,961 --> 00:53:39,480
Lots of progress has been made.

565
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:46,441
At about 12 years old, says Piaget, the child acquires the cobitof and reaches the truth of rationalism.

566
00:53:46,441 --> 00:53:51,081
At this stage, he discovers himself as a point of view on the world.

567
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:54,360
Well, apparently at four, the kid discovers.

568
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:55,321
But that's not important.

569
00:53:56,361 --> 00:53:59,080
What's important is how to make sense of this.

570
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,000
This is really the most interesting thing.

571
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:07,801
Now, what does the child learn when it learns that it's a point of view on the world?

572
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:11,961
Well, it's such an unstable thing that you see in the rest of the chapter.

573
00:54:11,961 --> 00:54:14,361
I'll try to state it in its purest form.

574
00:54:14,361 --> 00:54:21,000
The purest form of misunderstanding it, I think, is represented by Allison Goffnick in the psychology department.

575
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,561
And she knows I say this about her, so I've been wanting to give a seminar with her.

576
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:35,801
She says at four, the child discovers the idea idea, that it's got an eternal representation of the world, and the other person's also got an internal representation of the world.

577
00:54:35,801 --> 00:54:45,561
And in the kid case, the kid now knows that in its representation of the world, there are pencils, and in the other person's representation of the world, there are this candy.

578
00:54:45,560 --> 00:55:00,081
And there's something right about that, but it's gone to the whole switched over from we're open on a public world to we've each got a private representation, a private model of the world, and you have your model, and I have my model.

579
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:05,601
In my jargon, it's got it put my world prior to the world.

580
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:10,321
Is it that the three-year-old the world is prior to my world, it hasn't even got a my world?

581
00:55:10,321 --> 00:55:20,161
At four, the child has flipped over into pure Sarkrean or cognitive science or Cartesian craziness, I think.

582
00:55:20,321 --> 00:55:24,480
At any rate, you flip over into this view that my world is prior to the world.

583
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:30,881
It's on the basis of my model of my world that I'll have to figure out what your model of your world is.

584
00:55:30,881 --> 00:55:46,321
And then we can construct a model of the shared world, which there really isn't any, of the shared world, that we've all got our, but we can make this whatever it is in common into a shared understanding of the shared world.

585
00:55:46,321 --> 00:55:49,840
But you got your representation, all that you've got, really.

586
00:55:49,841 --> 00:55:51,280
This is pure Sartre.

587
00:55:51,921 --> 00:55:55,680
Sartre has worked this out in detail, and it's for Judy Speck.

588
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:05,201
That is, that from the point of view of each individual subject, that individual subject has got to have its own world.

589
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,040
And look at this on 415.

590
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:12,321
He's talking Sartre, though he doesn't say so, about halfway down.

591
00:56:12,801 --> 00:56:14,720
Well, I think I jumped a little ahead.

592
00:56:15,361 --> 00:56:19,761
Oh, yeah, one thing I want to say, which is very important, we're going to come back to it on 414 first.

593
00:56:19,761 --> 00:56:22,881
So, there, the child achieves the coquette.

594
00:56:22,881 --> 00:56:28,721
All of a sudden, the child turns into Descartes, discovers mental representation.

595
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:36,200
See, what I want to do is give a seminar with Alice and Dopnik and say, How do we know that the child discovers private mental representation?

596
00:56:36,441 --> 00:56:42,841
How do we know that the child isn't brainwashed into your model of representation at this point?

597
00:56:42,841 --> 00:56:53,081
All the child has understood, which is very important, is that it's got a perspective on the world, and it's different, and so have you, and yours is different than its.

598
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:58,201
But it doesn't say that you've got your private model of the world and the other person's got it.

599
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,281
But now comes the point I want to raise.

600
00:57:00,281 --> 00:57:16,120
It's very hard to understand how to talk about this, which where you either looks like we've all got the same world, and then you get the view which he attributes, which is really a kind of Kantian view, where he's not, it's not his own view anymore.

601
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,881
There's all these non-views.

602
00:57:18,361 --> 00:57:21,000
If I can refer to it so you know where it is.

603
00:57:21,961 --> 00:57:30,841
Yeah, okay, the bottom of 417, he's doing, starting with after this failure, he does the view that we are all happy.

604
00:57:30,841 --> 00:57:33,801
But let me try to say it just clearly first.

605
00:57:33,801 --> 00:57:46,360
So either you think like the child, the three-year-old, you not only think, you experience like the three-year-old, but you are, as he puts it on the next page, an empty head turned towards the world.

606
00:57:46,361 --> 00:57:48,441
Or someplace says that.

607
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:51,080
And where's the empty head turned towards the world?

608
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,600
Is somebody saying?

609
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,480
I'll tell you what it is.

610
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:59,240
I'm used to feeling these in the other version, which makes it hard for me to figure that way they are in this version.

611
00:58:03,401 --> 00:58:04,600
I didn't underline it.

612
00:58:05,401 --> 00:58:07,801
It's one of my favorite phrases.

613
00:58:08,761 --> 00:58:10,441
You didn't underline it either?

614
00:58:11,401 --> 00:58:12,480
Oh, no wonder I was.

615
00:58:11,881 --> 00:58:13,480
I'm glad you.

616
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:17,641
Okay, well, well, I was behind it instead of, but I don't see it yet.

617
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,160
You see it?

618
00:58:20,401 --> 00:58:21,280
The bottom.

619
00:58:22,721 --> 00:58:24,080
413, the bottom.

620
00:58:25,441 --> 00:58:26,080
Oh, yeah.

621
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,400
For him, that's the child.

622
00:58:28,401 --> 00:58:32,720
Then our empty heads turns toward one single self-evident world where everything takes place.

623
00:58:32,721 --> 00:58:33,361
That's wonderful.

624
00:58:33,361 --> 00:58:34,240
That's very important.

625
00:58:34,241 --> 00:58:36,081
That's the view of the three-year-old.

626
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:46,321
Now, and you can and then you flip from that to everybody's got their own perspective on the world, and all they can ever experience is their perspective on the world.

627
00:58:46,321 --> 00:58:48,801
That seems to be what you flip to it for.

628
00:58:48,801 --> 00:58:50,721
But it can't be.

629
00:58:50,721 --> 00:58:55,440
That's what, I mean, that's what the theory theory people think you flip to.

630
00:58:55,441 --> 00:58:59,360
But America Concy has this strange and interesting thing to say about it.

631
00:58:59,361 --> 00:59:01,841
It's a top of 414.

632
00:59:02,961 --> 00:59:04,160
It's not an answer.

633
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:04,961
It's a puzzle.

634
00:59:04,961 --> 00:59:08,241
And the puzzle just gets more and more puggling for the rest of the chapter.

635
00:59:08,801 --> 00:59:22,400
He says, at this stage, it is held, he, the child, discovers both as a discovered himself, both as a point of view on the world, and also called upon to transcend that point of view and construct an objectivity at the level of judgment.

636
00:59:22,401 --> 00:59:27,681
But perceptually, he's now limited to his point of view.

637
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:35,120
Piaget brings the child to a mature outlook as if the thoughts of the adult were self-sufficient and disposed of all the contradiction.

638
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:38,160
Piaget and Albert Krumbotnik are the same in that.

639
00:59:38,321 --> 00:59:40,401
All cognitivists are.

640
00:59:40,401 --> 00:59:51,601
But in reality, it must be the case, and this is the funny claim that's interesting, but in reality, it must be the case that the child's outlook is in some way vindicated against the adult and against Piaget.

641
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:59,041
Now, what that means, in some way, it must still be true that we experience ourselves as open on a shared world.

642
00:59:59,361 --> 01:00:00,240
And that's right.

643
01:00:00,241 --> 01:00:01,040
I mean, look at this.

644
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:01,600
Here we are.

645
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,401
You're looking at me.

646
01:00:02,401 --> 01:00:03,200
I'm looking at you.

647
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,921
We're all looking at this classroom.

648
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:08,840
You don't feel that you're in prison in your perspective and I'm in prison in my perspective.

649
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:20,281
We really feel, see, the phenomenon is that we are open heads turned toward the world from a point of view.

650
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:25,240
And that's what he's trying to say and preserve here.

651
01:00:25,241 --> 01:00:33,161
And he says, with all these cognitivists, leave out the empty head part, but you've got to have both.

652
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:37,961
And the question is, for the rest of the chapter, how do you have both?

653
01:00:38,281 --> 01:00:43,480
Because what he says is, then, okay, let's start at the top of 415.

654
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:54,841
When you can see other people's anger and without recourse to any inner experience of suffering or anger, aha, maybe that's the anti-empathy part.

655
01:00:54,841 --> 01:01:04,761
I perceive the grief or anger of the other in his conduct, in his face, in his hands, without recourse to any inner experience of suffering or anger.

656
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:06,440
That's anti-empathy.

657
01:01:07,321 --> 01:01:08,520
Where are we now?

658
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:21,881
And because grief and anger are variations belonging, variations of belonging to the world, undivided between body and consciousness, and applicable to others' conducts visible in his phenomenal body, as in my own conduct is presented to me.

659
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:26,760
But then the behavior of another and even his words are not that other.

660
01:01:26,761 --> 01:01:29,641
The grief and anger of the other have never been quite the same.

661
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:51,520
And now, having said that there's some sense in which I can directly experience from the the shared world from my perspective, the shared world being your anger, you've got it, I've got it, and I can see it just like you could see it in your heavy breathing and red face and fist and so forth.

662
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:57,040
That's the total, we're just open to the world.

663
01:01:57,361 --> 01:02:03,681
He goes back on the other side and says, yeah, but your anger is experienced by you and your grief in quite another way than mine.

664
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,081
They don't have the same significance.

665
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,520
You're really in grief.

666
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,681
And I'm feeling bad that you're in grief.

667
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,480
And now that's all a Sartrean story.

668
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:18,000
Sartre is definitely a believer in my world is prior to the world.

669
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,881
So you tell him the story about anger and stuff.

670
01:02:20,881 --> 01:02:30,401
And then Sartre answers, yeah, but your anger is experienced by you as a private thing, and my anger would be experienced to me as a private feeling, an inner feeling.

671
01:02:30,401 --> 01:02:38,081
And you can't get over that just by seeing this common sort of action that is angering him.

672
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:41,121
And so this is all on this page now.

673
01:02:42,321 --> 01:02:44,720
It's, I guess, two-thirds down.

674
01:02:44,721 --> 01:02:52,561
It's from the subjectivity of each of us, that each one projects this one and only world.

675
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:57,280
That is, it's not really a one and only world.

676
01:02:57,281 --> 01:03:00,320
There really is the private subjectivity of each of us.

677
01:03:00,321 --> 01:03:02,401
The one and only is in quotes.

678
01:03:02,401 --> 01:03:10,401
That DeSarte thinks that the shared world is a kind of, I don't know, not exactly an illusion, but a projection.

679
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:16,641
Your experience is of your anger from inside, so to speak.

680
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:27,760
The difficulties inherent in the perception of others did not stem from objective thought, nor do they dissolve with the discovery of behavior, Merlot-upon-T viewed that the Tsar talking against Merlot-upon-T.

681
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:35,000
Or rather, objective thought and the uniqueness of the Covita which flows from it are not fictions but firmly grounded in the phenomenon.

682
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:41,160
All that is, that's all Sarah's answering him, Merrow-upon-T.

683
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:59,160
And then I guess the next paragraph is probably Merrill-upon-T, but it becomes SART again on 416, where he says, I, on the other hand, share no common ground with another.

684
01:03:59,401 --> 01:04:01,881
This is to be really inside your perspective.

685
01:04:01,881 --> 01:04:08,441
For the positing of the other with his world and the positing of myself with mine are mutually exclusive.

686
01:04:08,441 --> 01:04:11,320
Now that's to say my world is prior to the world.

687
01:04:11,321 --> 01:04:15,000
The true phenomenon is that each of us has our own world.

688
01:04:15,321 --> 01:04:28,761
And there's whatever sense there is of the shared world, it's something we sort of each agree on, as something that we find to be common between our private worlds.

689
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,961
Once the other is posited, this is still Sartre.

690
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:49,561
Once the other's gaze is fixed upon, the other's gaze fixed upon me by inserting me into his field, stripped me of my part of my being, before itself has turned me into in-itself, in other words, it would readily be understood that I can recover it only by establishing relations with him and so forth.

691
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:56,281
Then you get all these relations of neutralizing the other guy and so forth.

692
01:04:56,761 --> 01:04:58,601
We're not going to go into that.

693
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:07,161
And now, about 15 lines down of 417, there is here a solophysium rooted in living experience and quite insurmountable.

694
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,801
I take it that we're still inside.

695
01:05:10,761 --> 01:05:19,881
And because I'm the only one, you talk about whatever happens, and it's in the middle of the page, I'm the only one by whom these experiences are experienced.

696
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:29,041
And there's something about inalienable subjectivity.

697
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:32,321
And then the paragraph ends on 417.

698
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,160
And now, this is the dialectic.

699
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,761
It's going back and forth.

700
01:05:35,761 --> 01:05:39,040
First, it looks like you've got to be open to the world.

701
01:05:39,361 --> 01:05:45,040
Second, it turns out, and it looks like there's phenomena that suggest you are, the anger, seeing the anger.

702
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:48,641
Then it looks like, no, each one of us has our own private world.

703
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,400
We're caught in our perspective.

704
01:05:50,401 --> 01:05:51,841
That's what we just have.

705
01:05:51,841 --> 01:05:56,881
Now, in the next paragraph, we flip back to the objectivist view.

706
01:05:56,881 --> 01:06:05,360
And it turns out, and it's really like Kant, everybody shares the same universal understanding.

707
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:15,921
So there's only one impartial spectator, one universal subject, and there's no problem of other mind for the objectivist, reflective person.

708
01:06:16,241 --> 01:06:20,880
I think, I don't know whether it starts with Kant, but he's certainly got Kant in mind.

709
01:06:20,881 --> 01:06:35,281
He talks about how the ego, the individual, is, there is an impartial spectator, and that constitutes the individual self, the bottom of 417, as just another thing.

710
01:06:36,401 --> 01:06:40,560
This general consciousness takes my empirical self to talk like Kant.

711
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:51,360
My transcendental consciousness, which is universal, posits my empirical self as that individual which has a view on the world, that I'm really this transcendental subject.

712
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:54,160
So then he's going to criticize that for a while.

713
01:06:55,360 --> 01:07:04,200
But now you should have in the back of your mind as you read it, by the way, this goes to the middle of 418, did not Nero-Ponte.

714
01:07:04,601 --> 01:07:06,120
Now it's not Scarte either.

715
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:07,000
It's Kant.

716
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,520
It's the opposite of Sartre.

717
01:07:08,761 --> 01:07:13,881
Instead of everything is completely my world, there is only the world.

718
01:07:13,881 --> 01:07:17,881
And me and my world are just constituted and posited.

719
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:27,720
Now he comes back to trying to find out a place for my world at the top of 419.

720
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,881
Remember what the question is.

721
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:31,720
I don't want to lose it.

722
01:07:31,721 --> 01:07:36,841
How do we keep both the three-year-old and the four-year-old's truth?

723
01:07:36,841 --> 01:07:50,040
We've got to keep the fact that we're empty heads turned toward the world, and we've got to keep the realization that I see things you don't see, and you see things that I don't see, that each of us have our own perspective.

724
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:59,000
And the idea is, somehow, Nero-Ponty thinks Piaget and Sartre all go in the direction of we're trapped in a perspective.

725
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,160
We stop thinking we're open heads.

726
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:05,320
And Kant, the transcendental ego, is like an open head turned toward the world.

727
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,320
All transcendental egos do the same.

728
01:08:07,961 --> 01:08:11,000
And Nero-Ponty rightly says we've got to keep both.

729
01:08:11,801 --> 01:08:14,360
And he hasn't told us how to keep both.

730
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:15,881
And so we keep looking.

731
01:08:15,881 --> 01:08:18,120
And I'm going to tell you, we've got five minutes.

732
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,641
He never tells us how to keep both.

733
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:22,200
He keeps flipping back and forth.

734
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:30,280
And then finally, you'll see, he tells you something very important, but something that won't help much.

735
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:31,000
Yet.

736
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:39,881
So he says at the top of 419 that I have to be experiencing other people, and I don't need to talk about that.

737
01:08:39,881 --> 01:08:43,720
On 420, it's started again, the middle of the page.

738
01:08:44,601 --> 01:08:46,761
The other transforms me into an object.

739
01:08:46,761 --> 01:08:48,360
He denies me.

740
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:51,040
I transform into an object and deny him.

741
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:51,921
It's asserted.

742
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,160
The middle of 420, that's straight star.

743
01:08:49,561 --> 01:08:56,240
That is Dory, no exit.

744
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:03,440
And we're going around in circles back and forth.

745
01:09:03,761 --> 01:09:15,520
So then he switches to solipsism and the question of solipsism, which is a different thing, whether I can understand what it is, whether the notion of other minds makes sense to me at all.

746
01:09:15,521 --> 01:09:17,760
I'm not going to say anything about that.

747
01:09:18,641 --> 01:09:27,040
And then he switches to the social world and goes on and on about Russian peasants and so forth on 422 and class consciousness.

748
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:30,320
It is a mess, an immense, crazy chapter.

749
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:34,000
The Russian peasants get completely analyzed in the freedom chapter.

750
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,320
He should have saved that.

751
01:09:37,601 --> 01:09:46,000
So, and then at the bottom of 423, in italics, something interesting that he attributes to Husserl.

752
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:53,760
And it seems to be sort of hard to know which way to take it, but it's in italics, so we should certainly try to figure out how to take it.

753
01:09:53,761 --> 01:10:01,760
We're now in the paragraph that begins, the problem of the existential modality of the social is here one with the problem of transcendence.

754
01:10:01,761 --> 01:10:06,400
That then gets him out of the Russian Revolution and back into phenomenology.

755
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:18,881
So then, how the presence to myself, which establishes my own limits and conditions every alien presence, is at the same time depresentation and throws me outside myself.

756
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:21,040
That's what we have to figure out.

757
01:10:23,601 --> 01:10:24,561
The topic's important.

758
01:10:24,561 --> 01:10:28,640
I said, well, let me, okay, the problem of ex where should I start there?

759
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:30,801
Okay, I have a good idea.

760
01:10:30,801 --> 01:10:43,320
That's a whether we are concerned with my body, the natural world, the past, birth, death, the question is always how I can be open to phenomena which transcend me, which nevertheless exist only to the extent that I take them up and live them.

761
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,560
Oh boy, is that important to use that sense?

762
01:10:45,561 --> 01:10:48,921
Because that could sound terribly much like idealism.

763
01:10:48,921 --> 01:10:50,520
But I don't think it's meant to be.

764
01:10:50,521 --> 01:10:50,841
What?

765
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:54,360
Well, the one I just read is the one after it.

766
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:55,881
Let's get this.

767
01:10:55,881 --> 01:11:05,240
I don't think he's saying that the question is how I can be open to phenomena which transcend me and which nevertheless exist only to the extent that I take them up.

768
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:11,320
That would be that nothing in the world exists except that I take it up.

769
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:12,761
That can't be right.

770
01:11:12,761 --> 01:11:19,801
It's got to be something I wrote, but my translation of it into something you could possibly could possibly believe.

771
01:11:20,921 --> 01:11:23,320
No, I don't see why I wrote it, but I'll tell you what I think.

772
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:32,120
It seems to me he's saying that we've got to understand that the significance of the phenomenon depends on.

773
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:41,720
That is, that the phenomena won't exist, that is, won't be significant unless I take it up, unless I take up the significance and live it.

774
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:44,360
I think something like that is what he wants to say.

775
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:49,721
Well, remember, you said that existence and significance are one and inseparable.

776
01:11:49,721 --> 01:11:50,200
That's right.

777
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,120
Well, that's what I'm basing it on, right?

778
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:58,921
You don't think existence for him isn't existence objectively like electrons exist.

779
01:11:58,921 --> 01:12:02,200
Electrons, I don't know what his word would be, but it would he's taken.

780
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:05,160
I guess probably electrons are real, he might say, or something.

781
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:08,280
But exist means for him, has significance.

782
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:13,320
And of course, something has significance for me, only to the extent that I take it up and give it significance.

783
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:13,721
Yeah.

784
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:15,160
Oh, really?

785
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:15,801
Oh, wow.

786
01:12:15,801 --> 01:12:17,641
I don't see how to do that, but I love to do that.

787
01:12:17,641 --> 01:12:17,881
How?

788
01:12:17,961 --> 01:12:18,680
Tell me.

789
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:25,360
That's just a case of experiencing something in a way which is not the majority of the fine by just your own perspective.

790
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,080
So there's a certain similarity.

791
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:32,400
And so the funny man, by taking the light, is important to me from it.

792
01:12:32,641 --> 01:12:33,600
Yes, of course.

793
01:12:33,921 --> 01:12:35,761
And I see that so interesting.

794
01:12:35,761 --> 01:12:47,200
So you take up the house and you take it up s from a perspective, but because you're open to the world from a perspective, but you're open to the whole house.

795
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,641
Maybe that's what the final thing.

796
01:12:48,801 --> 01:12:51,440
Look, we've got just a few minutes and skim to the end.

797
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:56,400
Because that might be what he's trying to say when he gives his solution, which I couldn't understand.

798
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:01,200
Okay, this is on page 424, 425 at the end.

799
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,681
I will get it now.

800
01:13:03,681 --> 01:13:04,961
Let's see.

801
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,520
There's all this stuff about death and birth.

802
01:13:07,521 --> 01:13:11,600
I swear that's just smoke in our eyes when we're trying to deal with it.

803
01:13:11,921 --> 01:13:14,961
I don't think for a minute that that's important.

804
01:13:14,961 --> 01:13:19,921
But we could look at the last paragraph.

805
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,360
Let's see how we start.

806
01:13:24,641 --> 01:13:32,641
Well, he thinks that it's a kind of contradiction that we are both open to the world and from our perspective, I think.

807
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:38,640
And now about eight lines down on 425, that perhaps he maintains that a philosophy cannot be centered around a contradiction.

808
01:13:38,641 --> 01:13:43,440
That all our descriptions, as they ultimately defy thought, are quite meaningless.

809
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:54,801
The objection would be valid if we were content to lay there under the term of phenomenon or phenomenal field the layer of pre-logical or magical experiences.

810
01:13:54,801 --> 01:13:57,360
For in that case, we should have no choice.

811
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:07,961
We would we should, for in that case, we should have to choose between believing the descriptions and abandoning thought, or knowing what we are talking about and abandoning our descriptions.

812
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,921
That's what Sartre is speaking about.

813
01:14:10,921 --> 01:14:17,160
Sartre is saying that only his view is really make sense, his ontology and his understanding of all this.

814
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:24,120
What Mero-Conte is saying is just the magical dobbly loop from Sartre's point of view.

815
01:14:24,681 --> 01:14:28,040
And Sartre in general, and Mero-Ponty has this wonderful relation.

816
01:14:28,761 --> 01:14:36,200
Sartre has got this very clear ontology, and if the phenomena doesn't fit it, he just says so much the worse for the phenomenon.

817
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:41,961
So there is no mutuality, there is no love, according to Sartre, because those are just illusions.

818
01:14:41,961 --> 01:14:46,440
And then Mero-Conte comes around and says, no, the most important thing is to get the phenomenon right.

819
01:14:46,601 --> 01:14:50,040
If we have to do something for the ontology, we'll fix it.

820
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:54,360
In case you think this is a strange relationship, it's the Plato-Aristotle relationship.

821
01:14:54,360 --> 01:15:01,400
Plato's always got all sorts of arguments and then denies change, denies all sorts of things that we see around it.

822
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:05,000
And then Aristotle comes along and says, no, the most real thing is this lectern.

823
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,761
And we'll fix our ontology.

824
01:15:06,761 --> 01:15:07,801
So here we go now.

825
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:10,040
Now let's see.

826
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:22,440
These descriptions must become an opportunity, his phenomenology, his sort of Aristotelian attitude, for defining a variety of comprehension and reflection, altogether more radical than objective thought.

827
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,600
Remember, Sartre is objective thought.

828
01:15:24,841 --> 01:15:31,240
To the phenomenology understood as direct description needs to be added a phenomenology of phenomenology.

829
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:41,561
We must return to the Kogeco in search of a more fundamental logos than that of objective thought, one which endows the latter with its relative validity and at the same time assigns to it its place.

830
01:15:41,721 --> 01:15:43,000
I think these are just words.

831
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,040
I'm going to think more about what Alvis said, but let's finish it.

832
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:49,560
So far, I find that absolutely unhelpful.

833
01:15:49,681 --> 01:15:58,801
At the level of being, it will never be intelligible that the subject should be both natural and naturalatis, that is, infinite and finite.

834
01:15:58,801 --> 01:16:04,480
But now this is what I called at the beginning of the lecture, just explaining the obscure by the Morris here.

835
01:16:04,481 --> 01:16:18,721
That if we rediscover time beneath the subject, and if we relate to the paradox of time, those of the body, the world, the the world, the thing, and others, we shall understand that beyond these, there is nothing to understand.

836
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:24,640
Well, maybe that's going to cash out as meaning something someday, but it certainly doesn't mean anything yet.

837
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:35,680
I don't understand, but Alvis said this now, I have to think about it, why he didn't just try to use the house story to do this instead of blow it up to Catherine's time and everything.

838
01:16:35,681 --> 01:16:39,761
But anyway, I this is why I didn't want to teach this, and I'm not going to teach it again.

839
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:40,320
Okay.
