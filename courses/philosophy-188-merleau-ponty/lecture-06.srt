00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,721
And I want to sort of sum up something about the idealism.

2
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:14,721
Try to sort out the vocabulary, which is, I think, hopeless, but try to be a little clearer than I was last time because I feel that I didn't get it quite right.

3
00:00:14,721 --> 00:00:19,920
But I'm going to lay it out in an order I think is clear.

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,481
I want to go back to page 10.

5
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:25,681
That's where, it's just the phrase I was looking for.

6
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:28,161
About 10 lines from the bottom.

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,601
We talked about it before.

8
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:39,481
Normal functioning must be understood as a process of integration in which the text of the external world is not so much copied as composed.

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,921
That's what's going to make the idealism.

10
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:48,361
There isn't any external world to copy.

11
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:54,121
There is us composing the perceptual world.

12
00:00:54,441 --> 00:01:08,361
And I think the process of integration is sort of interesting because he has this terribly sloppy discipline of constitution, which really ought to be left to Husserl and idealists because Husserl started it.

13
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:14,121
And I think integration would be a nice word for what our articulation remember.

14
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:15,241
We talked about that.

15
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:26,441
What we do, according to Merlot Fontey, which is that it's a kind of composing of the perceptual world, integration is, or articulation is.

16
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:42,841
And as such, it means that the perceptual world is always relative to us because there is no perceptual world except so far as we integrate it, articulated, organized it, in other words, he says constituted.

17
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:51,000
And he never tells you, I've been keeping my eye open, well, how he's using the word constituted, and it flops all over.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,920
So anyway, that's a nice line on page 10, which sets up page 47.

19
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm just jumping down to what we were talking about last time.

20
00:01:59,321 --> 00:02:03,320
Only I found another quote, which I didn't mention last time.

21
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:05,320
I had it in my notes, but I missed it.

22
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:12,760
And it's important to be one of the places where he makes the distinction between the world and the universe, which I made a lot of fuss about.

23
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:22,560
Unfortunately, there are other places where he doesn't make a good, the same or clear distinction between the world and the universe, but I'll try to explain as I go what's happening.

24
00:02:22,721 --> 00:02:30,641
Anyway, on 47, which is in attention and judgment, the best way is always to look for the footnote.

25
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,041
Here, the footnote is Kostero F.

26
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,201
R.

27
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:33,361
M.

28
00:02:33,441 --> 00:02:35,601
Wortile, page 331.

29
00:02:35,601 --> 00:02:37,601
That'll get you in the neighborhood.

30
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:42,321
That paragraph on 47 ends.

31
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:57,520
If, however, this de facto power is used without being explicitly posited, we become incapable of seeing past the rending of separate experiences, the phenomena of perception, and the world born in perception.

32
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,801
And never mind all that talk.

33
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,441
Now we want to, now the crucial.

34
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:10,241
If we get it wrong, we dissolve the perception and the world, sorry, we dissolve the perceived world.

35
00:03:10,561 --> 00:03:14,961
Remember, we've been using the term perceptual world a lot.

36
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:20,161
I don't know whether that's very frequent, but this is a place where he says perceptual world.

37
00:03:20,481 --> 00:03:28,481
That's what he's going to call the phenomenal field when he finally gets settled on his terminology.

38
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:34,481
So, and it's a mistake to dissolve the perceived world into a universe.

39
00:03:34,801 --> 00:03:51,841
And the universe is the galaxies and the molecules and everything that's there determinate independent of us and our activity of integrating or organizing.

40
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:52,241
That's it.

41
00:03:52,321 --> 00:03:57,840
If we dissolve the perceived world into a universe, which is nothing, and now, now comes the idealism.

42
00:03:57,841 --> 00:04:01,200
I mean, so far, anybody could agree.

43
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:14,681
There is a perceived world, it's relative to us, and we can make a move in which we go to the universe, which is whatever there is not relative to us, and you'd be a realist.

44
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:25,561
But what he says about the universe is: into a universe which is nothing but this very world cut off from its constitutive origins and made manifest because they are forgotten.

45
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:28,201
Well, that's to say, and he always seems to think this.

46
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:36,121
I mean, the universe is some derivative abstraction from the perceived world.

47
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:46,280
In the preface, which you're not reading, he says that science is to the perceived world the way a map is to the landscape.

48
00:04:46,601 --> 00:05:05,000
It's a very attenuated representation of some features, and it's important that the universe is nothing but this world cut off from its constitutive origins.

49
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:16,760
I mean, so you can't believe, if you believe that, that the universe is electrons and galaxies and stuff, if that means things in themselves that are not relative to us.

50
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:24,201
Because he's saying the universe is defined as leaving something out of the perceived world.

51
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:27,321
I just think it's wrong, but that's what he says.

52
00:05:27,321 --> 00:05:31,000
Now, I'll go on because all this is sort of relevant to what I said last time.

53
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:42,921
Thus, intellectualism leads consciousness on a footing of familiarity with absolute being, while the idea of a world in itself, now that's the world in itself is the universe.

54
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,201
I mean, that's, I talk about confusing terminology.

55
00:05:46,201 --> 00:05:50,801
It persists as a horizon, as the clued analytic reflection.

56
00:05:51,121 --> 00:06:07,761
So if you make this move and leave out the way we organize our experience into the perceptual world, then if you could do that, which he thinks you can't really get away with, you'd have a world in itself, and that is the universe.

57
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,481
I believe.

58
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:08,641
Yep.

59
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:09,601
You don't think so?

60
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,441
So are you saying that he thinks that the universe is the world in itself?

61
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:14,561
It's another name.

62
00:06:14,561 --> 00:06:18,721
He thinks that the universe, he thinks what the universe really is.

63
00:06:18,721 --> 00:06:35,201
I mean, people think the universe, people like me, benigned realists, think the universe has got galaxies and electrons and water and black holes and stuff in it, and they're just like they always were, and they'll be that way after we're all gone, and so forth and so forth.

64
00:06:36,241 --> 00:06:38,160
That's what people think the universe is.

65
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:53,841
But what the universe really is, is some aspect of the perceptual world, which if you leave out a whole lot, it's very Cartesian or Galileo-like in a way.

66
00:06:53,841 --> 00:07:14,721
You leave, instead of saying you leave out the secondary qualities and you find out what the universe is, which is the realist way, he thinks the universe is a kind of residue left after you leave out meaning and everything relative to perception, and that you couldn't even make any sense.

67
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,680
I think I have it later in my lecture.

68
00:07:18,961 --> 00:07:21,641
All the concepts used by science.

69
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,801
Our only meaningful.

70
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,241
Maybe I can find it, but I was writing no all over the margin.

71
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:30,880
Are only meaningful relative to the, yeah, here we are.

72
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,481
68 is part of the answer to what you just said, Rick.

73
00:07:36,361 --> 00:07:43,000
About four lines down, scientific consciousness borrows all its modes from the structures of living experience.

74
00:07:43,321 --> 00:07:44,760
You don't have to believe that.

75
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:52,040
You don't have to believe that quantum physics, which is bizarre phenomena that he doesn't know about, but it refutes him.

76
00:07:52,040 --> 00:08:01,321
I mean, these particles that are waves do and go through two slots at once and the weird entanglement that they talk about and so forth.

77
00:08:01,321 --> 00:08:05,000
That's not modeled on living experience.

78
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:18,841
Science has the perfect right and capacity to come up with totally new concepts, aliens, everyday experience, to describe what they discover out there as the properties of things.

79
00:08:18,841 --> 00:08:22,361
Let me finish that paragraph, three lines from the bottom.

80
00:08:23,081 --> 00:08:30,361
The pre-scientific life of consciousness alone endows scientific operations with meaning.

81
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,881
And to which these latter always refer back.

82
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,401
That's about the end of that paragraph on 68.

83
00:08:37,961 --> 00:08:41,001
Now, again, again, I just think that's wrong.

84
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:47,720
I don't see how quantum weirdness refers back to our everyday experience.

85
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:56,200
And that's what he thinks, which means that the universe is, there isn't any universe in itself.

86
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,680
There is what science talks about, and what science talks about is relative to us.

87
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,081
Okay, so let's say it's the terminology of theory.

88
00:09:03,081 --> 00:09:06,601
Rouletain T has a distinction between the universe and the world in itself.

89
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:09,240
And it seems like he wants to say there is no world in itself.

90
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,440
That's the prejudice of the world.

91
00:09:10,521 --> 00:09:11,960
That's the problem that he gets.

92
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,281
That's what you get.

93
00:09:12,281 --> 00:09:17,160
So he's got a story of science where he's going to call the object of science the universe.

94
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,841
And you think that the world in itself is the universe.

95
00:09:20,081 --> 00:09:21,841
Well, no, that's interesting.

96
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:22,640
Let me think.

97
00:09:19,321 --> 00:09:25,521
We just know what this includes into the universe, which is nothing.

98
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:26,640
Yes, that's true.

99
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,440
So he thinks there is stuff that science talks about.

100
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,240
What science talks about is the universe.

101
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:45,680
But science thinks the universe is in itself, whereas in fact the universe is a kind of abstraction from the perceived world.

102
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,160
And it's a kind of cultural construction, he says later, about nebulae.

103
00:09:50,160 --> 00:10:00,880
And as I keep saying, if this was an important part of his philosophy, I would I didn't say it this way, but I wouldn't be teaching it, and I would hope you would all leave.

104
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,920
But this is not an important part of his.

105
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:10,000
It doesn't matter to what's important in that he's an idealist of the universe.

106
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:14,640
It doesn't play any important role finally in his argument.

107
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:19,280
And so he's okay.

108
00:10:19,281 --> 00:10:22,800
I mean, he's as okay as Kant, which is pretty okay.

109
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:26,800
Remember, Kant, for those who had it, is an empirical realist.

110
00:10:26,801 --> 00:10:31,200
He thinks Newtonian science isn't about things in themselves.

111
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,440
It's about appearances.

112
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,920
It's about the phenomenal world.

113
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:43,920
But as a science, about the phenomenal world, it's got inner subjective agreement and lots of control and beautiful structure.

114
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,081
And he and Mirlupensky is like that.

115
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:48,561
He's a very likely like economy.

116
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,121
Yeah.

117
00:10:49,440 --> 00:11:04,241
Well, given what you just said, you may have just answered my question, but it sounded to me like you were saying that Mirlupansky is making sort of a strong metaphysical claim that uh about, you know, the kind of sort of different kind of idealism, that the universe and electrons are just something, you know, we make up or they're all relative to us.

118
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:18,041
But I I read it in this sort of just making an epistemic claim that the kind of knowledge that science gives us is only possible against the background of our sort of ordinary understanding of the world and things like that, which you might agree with if you're a mental health.

119
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:29,321
But I think that epistemic claim is he turns it into a metaphysical claim because he really wants to say, and you can see it around the notion of determinant, there is nothing determinate.

120
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:33,721
There is no determinate the perceptual world is never fully determinate.

121
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,000
It's always just in the process of getting determinate.

122
00:11:37,001 --> 00:11:52,680
And it and the idea that there's a universe out there that is determinate, that metaphysical realist claim he thinks is false because there's we or at least that there's I I think he thinks it's false.

123
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,321
I don't know if he thinks it's unintelligible.

124
00:11:55,321 --> 00:12:17,400
He certainly yeah, I don't know how he would have the right to think it's unintelligible, but I have a feeling he does think it's unintelligible because he thinks that if we get access to it only through the perceptual world, then it must be that the perceptual world is in some way necessary for it.

125
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,361
And that it's such a loser argument.

126
00:12:20,361 --> 00:12:22,920
I mean, he doesn't have a concept of access.

127
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:34,361
He doesn't have a concept that the practices by which we find out about the universe could be completely accidental to the structure of the universe.

128
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:41,121
That however we find out about electrons, which is very interesting in the sociology of science can study it.

129
00:12:41,121 --> 00:12:43,560
Those are not essential properties of electrons.

130
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:50,880
They're contingent properties, but they show up in it's under certain conditions and you can use them to bombard things and so forth.

131
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:56,801
And there's stuff out there, at least it's intelligible, I suppose, that has its own structure.

132
00:12:57,121 --> 00:13:01,200
And we get access to that.

133
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:17,121
Anyway, so but he thinks he turns the epistemological, to put it your way, into an ontological claim that there couldn't be any completely determinate thing in itself because our only access to it is through the perceptual world and the perceptual world isn't going to ever be determinate.

134
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,680
I find it strange to be defending relative onto yourself.

135
00:13:19,761 --> 00:13:20,560
Oh, I'm glad you are.

136
00:13:20,561 --> 00:13:24,081
I think determinants need to be an epistemic notion as well.

137
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,841
I don't see that.

138
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:27,281
Well, let me think about it.

139
00:13:28,321 --> 00:13:34,081
So the perceptual world is only experienced as determinant.

140
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:49,760
But then why would he say that it's a kind of illusion that we have to break this crypto mechanism that we think that there is an objective determinate world?

141
00:13:50,880 --> 00:14:20,480
Why doesn't he just think that's why doesn't he think, like normal people think, that we discover this objective determinate world through our epistemological, our capacities for learning about things, and that it's only insofar as it's our learning about it that it's indeterminate, but really we find out through our learning about it that it's determinate.

142
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,521
He has a name for that.

143
00:14:21,521 --> 00:14:23,680
He keeps criticizing those guys.

144
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,121
What does he say?

145
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:28,801
He says that, oh, that's the prejudge du Monde.

146
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:31,280
That's the prejudice of the world.

147
00:14:31,281 --> 00:14:33,921
Oh, that's the, what's the other word for that?

148
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,321
The experience right?

149
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:37,481
I think we jump from the experience error.

150
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:37,640
Okay.

151
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,601
Experience error.

152
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:39,480
That was the world I live in.

153
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:46,041
These are all pretty insulting sounding notions for just an epistemological distinction, I think.

154
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,361
So we can discuss, we have to discuss it more.

155
00:14:48,361 --> 00:14:52,201
But I would love to, I mean, if there's a way to defend him, I would love to defend him.

156
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:57,880
It's my second to Heidegger as far as being somebody I think has got a lot of truth.

157
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,361
Yeah.

158
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:05,960
Do you not think this ongoing is on his density?

159
00:15:06,361 --> 00:15:07,000
He do I what?

160
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,000
He doesn't hold in respect to the perceived world as well.

161
00:15:09,001 --> 00:15:14,680
He doesn't hold in respect to the he doesn't hold what with respect to the perceived world.

162
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,320
You've got to think the same objection you were talking about.

163
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,040
Right, right.

164
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:18,921
No, no, right.

165
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,400
Good point.

166
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,680
I have to keep saying that.

167
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,880
And I found a place, but now I've lost it for a moment.

168
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,640
But keep your eye open for it.

169
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:36,841
He thinks, certainly he thinks the perceived world is always somewhat indeterminate and always being made more and more determinate in some direction and being losing its determinacy in another.

170
00:15:36,841 --> 00:15:43,080
And I even found a place, I wish I had grabbed it, where it seemed, maybe I've got it in my notes, but I don't think so.

171
00:15:43,081 --> 00:15:47,240
Where he says, in effect, that it happens extremely fast, which is what I want.

172
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:54,201
In microseconds, the world is thinking, oh, it's got to do with the vegetable kingdom and all that funny talk.

173
00:15:54,200 --> 00:16:02,601
Where is that, where we're supposed to experience the vegetable kingdom taking place in, in effect, in milliseconds in front of our eyes?

174
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:03,640
It's a big footnote.

175
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,841
So maybe.

176
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,081
Isn't it in that huge footnote?

177
00:16:07,081 --> 00:16:08,040
That's what.

178
00:16:08,281 --> 00:16:19,160
Because I was surprised to see that, and I like that, that he thinks that the world is indeterminate, but it's all that we're constantly making very fast, making it determinate.

179
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,040
I mean, we normally you don't see that.

180
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,441
You have to slow it down with the ship, for example.

181
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:26,081
But where is you?

182
00:16:26,081 --> 00:16:31,841
We're supposed to be like the beginning of the vegetable kingdom taking.

183
00:16:31,841 --> 00:16:33,441
At every moment, we've got to find it.

184
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,040
At every moment, trees and nature, and all that.

185
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,521
What?

186
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,880
I don't know yet.

187
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,680
I mean, I'm not reading yet.

188
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,041
I'm not saying, but I remember.

189
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,800
At every moment, trees and nature and everything like that.

190
00:16:44,801 --> 00:16:45,280
There we are.

191
00:16:45,281 --> 00:16:45,761
There we are.

192
00:16:45,761 --> 00:16:47,841
50 and 51.

193
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,240
Now we're in attention and judgment with the footnote, the faculty of judging.

194
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:55,761
Yeah, let's look at this.

195
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:57,121
This is just another point.

196
00:16:57,121 --> 00:17:00,240
I mean, see, this is just, I'm agreeing with him.

197
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,601
One, that Merlot Ponty thinks that the perceptual world is indeterminate.

198
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,240
And I agree with him, that he convinces me that it is.

199
00:17:10,801 --> 00:17:16,000
That there is, that we're always organizing it.

200
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:18,800
What was the word we just found back there that I liked?

201
00:17:18,801 --> 00:17:19,841
That's page six.

202
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,520
Things in the air.

203
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
We're doing, is that integrating it?

204
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,041
Yeah.

205
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,720
Now, here's what he says here.

206
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:36,321
When I glance rapidly about at the objects surrounding me in order to find my bearings and locate myself, I scarcely can be said to grasp the world in some instantaneous aspect.

207
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:42,880
I identify here the door, there the windows, and so forth and so forth, which are given to me as simple meanings.

208
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,920
When I contemplate an object with watching it and so forth, this isn't getting to be where I want yet.

209
00:17:48,240 --> 00:18:02,000
I become aware that each perception, not merely that the sights which I'm discovering for the first time, reenacts its own account of the birth of intelligence and has some element of creating an intelligence about it, in order that I may recognize the tree.

210
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,201
Here's the line.

211
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:12,920
In order that I may recognize the tree as a tree, it is necessary that beneath this familiar meaning, the momentary arrangement of the visible scene should begin all over again.

212
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,761
That's a really strong claim.

213
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:20,280
You walk into the room, and very quickly, you've got to make sense of everything.

214
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:27,081
It gets very easy, and you could do it very quickly in microseconds because you're very familiar with this room of chairs.

215
00:18:27,081 --> 00:18:35,400
If you walk into a strange enough situation, like the mass in the ship again, where he found one to slow you down, it takes you a while to arrange it.

216
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,240
But it's very interesting here.

217
00:18:37,561 --> 00:18:46,440
The momentary arrangement of the visual scene should begin all over again, as on the first day of the vegetable kingdom, to outline the individual idea of a tree.

218
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:50,200
That's the secondary.

219
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:55,241
Yes, that's the role of secondary attention, normal attention.

220
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,281
Only it's missed by the people who are doing it.

221
00:18:58,281 --> 00:18:59,241
It's so fast.

222
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:11,960
I thought, I was very suspicious of this because I think it's always dubious when a philosopher tells you that something happens so fast or so marginal or so small or so unconscious.

223
00:19:12,841 --> 00:19:18,601
As I hear the joke goes, it's like excusing an illegitimate child on the grounds that it's a very small one.

224
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:25,000
It sounds like he's saying that it goes so fast, you don't have to worry about it or something.

225
00:19:25,001 --> 00:19:45,240
And so I asked Walter Freeman, my neuroparallelocontean, do you think it's so that the brain has to actually start with a kind of chaos and disorder, and organize that into an attractor every time I recognize an object like a tree, even if I'm familiar with it?

226
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,200
And he said, yes, it takes, I forget how many microseconds.

227
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:56,640
But he, with his electrodes on rabbit brains, says he can actually see the brain correlate of this happening.

228
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,841
So that's fine.

229
00:19:57,841 --> 00:19:59,361
I'm arguably by that.

230
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,240
It happens so fast you don't see it.

231
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,841
It doesn't, you know.

232
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:15,841
You therefore think, go back to the crypto mechanism, you therefore think that you were always encountering determinate objects because this ordering it, what was the phrase here?

233
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:20,960
There's some arranging of it happens there, very, very fast.

234
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:28,400
And sort of outside consciousness, not in some unconscious place, but just too fast for you to see it.

235
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:31,200
Okay?

236
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:37,200
So the important point that you're answering the question is how we can accept what he says.

237
00:20:37,521 --> 00:20:38,640
About the perceptual world.

238
00:20:39,121 --> 00:20:41,601
Yeah, I accept what he says about the perceptual world.

239
00:20:41,601 --> 00:20:55,601
Of course we have to keep constantly arranging it and ordering it and taking some things that were in the background and indeterminate and making them a figure and making them more determinate and losing other bits of determination.

240
00:20:55,601 --> 00:20:57,361
That's just how it goes.

241
00:20:57,361 --> 00:20:59,441
Therefore, it seems sort of obvious.

242
00:20:59,521 --> 00:21:03,040
I can't imagine how anybody would want to deny it.

243
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:11,601
If it weren't for us, there wouldn't be this kind of perceptual world, always becoming more determinate, but never completely determinate.

244
00:21:11,601 --> 00:21:14,561
If that's how it is, that's the wrong claim.

245
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:21,761
If that's the phenomena, then it clearly depends on our capacity to arrange it.

246
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,361
That's now.

247
00:21:23,361 --> 00:21:23,841
Yeah.

248
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,040
You know, I, yeah, yeah, well, that's why I was hedging.

249
00:21:29,281 --> 00:21:30,321
That's a deep question.

250
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:35,001
Yeah, and she's calling me on saying that it takes place outside of consciousness.

251
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:36,200
That is the wrong way to put it.

252
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:36,440
What?

253
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,720
Yes, this arranging of the world.

254
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:57,240
And he wants to say, he says I'll get there in the lecture, that it's the job of phenomenologists to describe the process, and yet he also seems to say that it happens so momentarily that you don't see it, and it's very hard to see it.

255
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,841
And how does he get us to see it?

256
00:21:58,841 --> 00:22:01,560
Well, two ways that I can think of.

257
00:22:01,561 --> 00:22:06,920
One, I keep saying he's brilliant at finding sort of breakdown situations that slows it down.

258
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:18,440
And that's how we find ourselves trying to arrange the ship and the trees, the math and the trees, and there's this instability, and we're sort of uneasy because we can't get a good grip on it.

259
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,880
And then we do.

260
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,400
And that's one way he does it.

261
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:29,321
The other way he does it, and this is now a pitch for you to read the Cézanne essay in Sense and Nonsense, which I've got on reserve.

262
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:46,521
Great artists, particularly Cézanne, and maybe only Cézanne, as far as I can tell from reading him, have been able to see it and slow it down enough to paint it so that when you look at a Cézanne painting, you experience this coming into stability of the objects in it.

263
00:22:46,521 --> 00:22:49,960
That's why they're painted so weird, and yet you don't know they're painted weird.

264
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,321
It's a brilliant essay.

265
00:22:51,321 --> 00:22:58,121
Anyway, so, but it happens usually so fast that you're not aware of it.

266
00:22:59,001 --> 00:23:02,281
That's a better way of saying than outside consciousness.

267
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,801
You can't see it, it just goes too fast.

268
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,040
There are things in the world all over that go too fast.

269
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:13,800
The fluorescent light is flickering at 60 cycle, but you don't see it.

270
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,681
And that's it.

271
00:23:17,081 --> 00:23:25,440
But it's the job of the phenomenologist to convince you, to get you to see it in special situations and to convince you that, of course, it's happening all the time.

272
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:27,361
And this thing about the tree is fascinating.

273
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,201
I mean, I'd never paid attention to it before.

274
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,000
It's a very interesting, strong claim.

275
00:23:32,001 --> 00:23:34,480
And so, say, I don't paint trees like that.

276
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,321
You paint trees coming into stability as trees.

277
00:23:38,321 --> 00:23:39,121
Yeah.

278
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,640
I thought Father Van Dande's feeling this comment.

279
00:23:42,801 --> 00:23:50,320
I don't see why the natural world is different from the perceptual world and why the reason.

280
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,601
Well, Mrs.

281
00:23:51,601 --> 00:23:53,041
Belov and she is giving it.

282
00:23:53,041 --> 00:24:02,561
He pointed out that the fact that our access to the sensory world is different from the very great way doesn't mean that electrons depend on its own costs.

283
00:24:02,561 --> 00:24:02,880
Right.

284
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:15,760
Well, the fact that our access to the perceived objects, electronic most, doesn't depend on our.

285
00:24:15,761 --> 00:24:16,801
No, no, you're right.

286
00:24:16,801 --> 00:24:18,160
It doesn't mean it.

287
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:26,400
And in fact, the predatory fade duo, the world, the prejudice of the world and the crystal mechanism and everything, according to him, hides it.

288
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,121
And common sense and the meaning of even our words don't capture it.

289
00:24:31,121 --> 00:24:32,321
So it's his job.

290
00:24:32,321 --> 00:24:34,400
And that's tied up with what I said to her.

291
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,321
He doesn't think it's obvious at all.

292
00:24:36,321 --> 00:24:44,000
He thinks it's his job to get us to see that even though it could be the case.

293
00:24:44,001 --> 00:24:45,440
Maybe I'm missing the point.

294
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,161
I don't know yet.

295
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,041
I mean, you're ready to say, of course, we're having this experience of organizing it.

296
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,801
I think that I misunderstood you.

297
00:24:52,801 --> 00:25:05,721
But why couldn't that be that we're not that we're imposing it, but that we are getting back representing it, getting it right about it.

298
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,280
I see your point now.

299
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:12,041
I haven't understood any reason to think that the left turning is any more mind-dependent than the other encounter.

300
00:25:12,521 --> 00:25:13,721
Very, I see your point now.

301
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,441
Very interesting.

302
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:14,920
Very good.

303
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,720
I missed you.

304
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:16,200
Dr.

305
00:25:16,361 --> 00:25:18,121
James was sort of his mind-ending change.

306
00:25:18,361 --> 00:25:18,680
I see.

307
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,121
Well, that's that's good.

308
00:25:24,281 --> 00:25:26,121
Yeah, perceptual and learning.

309
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:32,841
Either you ought to be an idealist about the perceptual world and the world of science, or you ought to be a realist about the idea.

310
00:25:33,001 --> 00:25:36,121
But you can't have girls, which is realistic about mind-blooded ideals.

311
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:37,000
Interesting.

312
00:25:37,081 --> 00:25:38,121
Oh, dear.

313
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:39,801
I have to think hard about this.

314
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:40,841
Let me see.

315
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:48,041
I'm certainly not happy with the alternative, so I see exactly what you're saying.

316
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,640
I have to think about it.

317
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,361
Let me make Alva's point in as simplest possible way.

318
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,960
So take the tree example.

319
00:25:55,961 --> 00:25:59,961
So in X microseconds, I organize my experience as a tree.

320
00:25:59,961 --> 00:26:03,801
Why shouldn't I think there was a completely determinate tree all along?

321
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,121
And this is how I come to perceive it.

322
00:26:06,121 --> 00:26:09,001
So that I didn't compose it, I copied it.

323
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:10,441
That's what you're saying.

324
00:26:10,441 --> 00:26:19,800
And if you can say that, and if I'm going to say that about electrons, that science copies them, it doesn't compose them, why shouldn't I say it about trees?

325
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,680
This isn't electrons.

326
00:26:21,401 --> 00:26:26,121
I'm just not just neither compose it nor copy it, but in charge of it.

327
00:26:34,121 --> 00:26:36,920
No, no, that I can I think I agree with him.

328
00:26:36,921 --> 00:26:38,521
I want to resist that.

329
00:26:38,521 --> 00:26:51,520
That that that's that would say that you don't have in your experience the coming into uh determinateness of your experience of the lectern.

330
00:26:51,521 --> 00:27:13,440
He thinks that with his Manuel-Conte story and with his masts and ships and with endless other stuff about motion, about space, about time, about everything that the whole book is going to be about, that he's got a story about how stable objects with stable properties are composed by your bodily response.

331
00:27:13,521 --> 00:27:14,720
I'm not going to give that up.

332
00:27:16,561 --> 00:27:18,560
That's what you need to do to get a grip.

333
00:27:18,561 --> 00:27:21,440
Yes, but getting a grip on something isn't inventing that nature.

334
00:27:21,521 --> 00:27:22,961
Oh, he's clear about that.

335
00:27:22,961 --> 00:27:24,160
Well, that's fine.

336
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,760
I mean, there's so there are three levels.

337
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,400
Let's see.

338
00:27:27,441 --> 00:27:36,081
I'm assuming that he can tell us how we come to get a determinate, stable experience of trees and electrons.

339
00:27:36,081 --> 00:27:38,481
I'm also saying we don't have anything like that.

340
00:27:38,481 --> 00:27:40,880
Sorry, not electrons, trees and lecterns.

341
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:47,041
I'm saying there's no story about how we come to get a stable grip on electrons of the same sort.

342
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,121
There's a sociological story of how we get to discover them.

343
00:27:51,121 --> 00:27:52,080
That's all right.

344
00:27:52,081 --> 00:28:03,601
But it isn't as if every time a scientist sets about to think about electrons, he has to compose them because he's thinking about them and not perceiving them.

345
00:28:03,601 --> 00:28:09,841
If he's perceiving something, like through a telescope or something, then of course he has to go through this constitution thing.

346
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,760
But oh, it's so complicated.

347
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:30,401
If what he perceives, I'll just say this once more and put it aside, has a nature, a natural kind, and essential properties, then the process he goes through to perceive it is clearly irrelevant to what it is.

348
00:28:31,121 --> 00:28:34,441
And I just think that's okay.

349
00:28:34,441 --> 00:28:35,800
That's the prejudice of the world.

350
00:28:34,081 --> 00:28:36,840
Well, that's the prejudice.

351
00:28:36,921 --> 00:28:43,401
Well, that's yes, I suppose so, except that Electra isn't a natural kind, and that's important.

352
00:28:43,401 --> 00:28:44,440
But what a minute.

353
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:50,761
So, but I want to worry about the first thing he said, which is much harder.

354
00:28:50,760 --> 00:29:02,440
Why can't we say that we're just perceiving, that is, copying, that is, I mean, this this is this isn't just a trivial objection from Alva.

355
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:05,880
This is what everybody in the cognitive science business thinks.

356
00:29:07,001 --> 00:29:09,480
Everybody, say Alice and Goffnick, for instance.

357
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:21,881
I mean, they've got this idea that what we're doing is making, learning to form the representations which copy the way things are.

358
00:29:21,881 --> 00:29:28,761
And the things are completely determinate, and the representations are determinate, and it takes a little bit of indeterminacy to get there.

359
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,440
And Merle Ponty is making a big fuss about this indeterminacy it takes to get there.

360
00:29:32,441 --> 00:29:38,841
But what right does he have to say that we're composing the world instead of representing it?

361
00:29:39,401 --> 00:29:41,000
That's the question.

362
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,560
It's about the perceptual stuff, never mind the science.

363
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,440
Following Alva's point, I think there are three possible provisions here.

364
00:29:50,441 --> 00:29:50,840
Okay.

365
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,280
One, that we are creating the object, and that's just idealism.

366
00:29:54,521 --> 00:29:58,680
The other, that we're representing the world, and that's indirect realism.

367
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:03,081
So then, right, the third option, which I think people figure that, which is that we have access to it.

368
00:30:03,081 --> 00:30:05,801
Direct access would not be a direct realism.

369
00:30:05,961 --> 00:30:09,960
We have indirect realism, idealism, and direct realism.

370
00:30:09,961 --> 00:30:14,201
And I thought with Iron Allen, your story would be the access to it.

371
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,320
To everyday stuff.

372
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,520
And that's not incompatible with this talk of composing, because composing can mean sort of two things.

373
00:30:19,961 --> 00:30:22,720
It can mean like cooking up.

374
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:30,881
But also, if you think about composing a photograph, it's sort of deciding what's going to, or not deciding, but making something the foreground and something the background.

375
00:30:30,881 --> 00:30:36,000
And, you know, just a simple shift in perspective can change that without you inventing anything.

376
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,201
It's one thing to organize your experience.

377
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,840
If we're named enough of that, it's the other, to organize the world, creating the world.

378
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,520
And that's where the idealism comes in.

379
00:30:45,521 --> 00:30:52,241
So it seems like if we're composing, you know, there's an organizational sense in our experience, that's one thing.

380
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:58,961
But if we're actually organizing the world to create the authors in the perceived world, that seems to be the kind of idealistic.

381
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:00,320
I was trying to agree with you.

382
00:31:00,481 --> 00:31:01,760
Yeah, I'm even reading it with you.

383
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,121
It's more direct realist.

384
00:31:05,121 --> 00:31:09,200
Yes, square that direct realism is just indeterminacy, determinacy talk.

385
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,481
And this is the problem, I think.

386
00:31:12,001 --> 00:31:12,800
It's turning in.

387
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,880
I mean, it keeps, there are two different issues.

388
00:31:14,881 --> 00:31:18,160
I have no question about what Meryloponty thinks.

389
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:27,761
It's not epistemological with him because he actually keeps saying it's a mistake in your metaphysics to think that there's a determinate world.

390
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,360
This is Cartesian.

391
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:35,680
He says, wow, there are these subjects and they have access, however, to a determinate world.

392
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,321
No.

393
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:43,360
He's got a whole story, and the whole book is a story about how we make this stuff determinate.

394
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,920
Not just our experience of it, but we make the perceptual world determinate.

395
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,600
That he believes.

396
00:31:49,601 --> 00:31:55,200
Now, I think the interesting problem that Alva has posed me is: why does he think that?

397
00:31:55,521 --> 00:31:56,480
What's the argument?

398
00:31:56,481 --> 00:32:00,160
It may end up having to say that we don't know yet.

399
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:09,480
There's a funny footnote where he says, only when we get to the chapter in time will you understand why this is transcendental idealism of the sort that I'm giving you.

400
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:24,280
I don't remember how the chapter on time is going to help, but I guess he's going to argue, like Kant, that if time is dependent on us and the kind of bodies we have, and somehow argue that there wouldn't be any time if it weren't for that.

401
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,881
I don't know how he's going to argue that.

402
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:36,520
Then he'd have the right to say what Alva thinks he doesn't have the right to say, and I grant you, I don't see how he has the right to say it yet either, or whether he ever will.

403
00:32:36,840 --> 00:33:03,081
That at some point, the idea could be that we have direct access to determinate objects, and the description of how our direct access to them has to become determinate in our experience doesn't show that it's metaphysically wrong to think that this world is made up of determinate objects.

404
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:03,800
I take it.

405
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,081
That's what you say.

406
00:33:05,081 --> 00:33:06,440
And I think that's right.

407
00:33:06,441 --> 00:33:07,240
Do you have an answer?

408
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:07,640
You look like.

409
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,521
Wait a minute.

410
00:33:08,521 --> 00:33:10,360
There's somebody up there and then I want to hear what you have to say.

411
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:10,680
Yeah.

412
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:17,400
Yeah, I think this example might enforce the whole manner of the paper that shows that you may echo.

413
00:33:17,561 --> 00:33:24,601
If you imagine the camera in pictures, like we're very passive, it has a lot of things.

414
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,721
Interesting.

415
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,041
Yeah.

416
00:33:26,601 --> 00:33:27,160
Ah.

417
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,400
Now.

418
00:33:30,521 --> 00:33:35,081
Now, it's true that when we're looking at the photograph ourselves, we are kind of composing.

419
00:33:35,081 --> 00:33:38,001
We know, that, you know, this is a violent beef.

420
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,561
Good, good.

421
00:33:38,521 --> 00:33:40,961
Show it to a fly, it might not understand it that way.

422
00:33:41,081 --> 00:33:44,121
So it's true that we are in position depth as sensitive.

423
00:33:44,121 --> 00:33:48,760
So I don't know if it's kind of like the positive word inside of why we outside anymore.

424
00:33:49,001 --> 00:33:49,920
It's very funny.

425
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,121
It's like the quantum business.

426
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:58,800
I mean, it's as if somehow everything gets resolved into indeterminacy until you look at it and make it determinate.

427
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:13,601
Not only the picture, but the tree that it's got a picture of isn't just there, completely determinate, such that if you and all human beings cease to exist, there'd still be that determinate tree.

428
00:34:13,601 --> 00:34:15,280
I think that's what he thinks.

429
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,200
I mean, I'm glad we're having this discussion.

430
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,721
It's very illuminating to me.

431
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:23,201
I've never realized how completely weird his position is.

432
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:35,601
I mean, it is really strange to claim that there is this composing or that doesn't work, whatever these other words are finally constituting, but I don't like that word.

433
00:34:35,601 --> 00:34:39,441
Organizing, articulating, going on.

434
00:34:39,441 --> 00:34:42,721
And there's something there, by the way.

435
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,640
We don't make it up out of whole cloth.

436
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:51,680
He's got there, there are boundary conditions on what you can make of it.

437
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:56,561
The tree and the photograph, you can't look, you can't turn them into a picture of an elephant.

438
00:34:57,121 --> 00:35:10,801
But given those boundary conditions, it's only when you get the right set, you unlock it, and it becomes determinate in your experience.

439
00:35:11,121 --> 00:35:14,081
And this is the amazing move.

440
00:35:14,081 --> 00:35:18,720
And there is no determinate perceptual world.

441
00:35:19,521 --> 00:35:24,481
The perceptual world just is the world as you experience it.

442
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:25,481
Why?

443
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,321
Yeah.

444
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:36,200
I think Waggy thinks that, and I think he's wrong in his thinking, as we go in the first couple of pages with the experience error, you know, prejudice of the world in constantly, I thought it was dope.

445
00:35:36,441 --> 00:35:50,441
But I'll actually suggest something like this last week, I think, where he wants to criticize the scientists who are starting with the prejudice of the world understood as the scientific universe, the world in itself.

446
00:35:50,441 --> 00:36:05,081
And that if you start with that, and if you drill in the experience error, then you're going to get this understanding of perception as external stimuli, mechanisms producing sensations, and you're not going to have room for the indeterminacy percept.

447
00:36:05,481 --> 00:36:10,680
I'm going to start off by recognizing the phenomenology of the indeterminacy of percept.

448
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:10,920
Right.

449
00:36:11,001 --> 00:36:11,640
This is part of it.

450
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,720
I think James was talking about the epistemic issue.

451
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,320
And then he's going to confuse this.

452
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:15,800
But I'm going to say that.

453
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:18,201
So it seems.

454
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,241
So it seems.

455
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:24,601
So first we let's just give ourselves an assignment for the rest of the semester to keep our eyes open.

456
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:49,160
I mean, I don't think it's any problem to see that he thinks that he did, thanks to Gestaltsists and going on beyond the Gestaltsists, he's got a story of how in each person's experience there is indeterminacy and turning into determinacy, and it's all like the masks and the ships happening all the time, only very fast.

457
00:36:49,481 --> 00:36:58,201
It's when he turns that into metaphysics and says, and that shows there aren't any determinate objects in the everyday world.

458
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:03,800
That move, I have no idea where it comes, how he can justify that.

459
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,680
So he tries to justify the science.

460
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,440
I think he's just wrong.

461
00:37:07,441 --> 00:37:08,961
I can get started with James now.

462
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:13,920
He's just preventing using the epistemic active story and turning it into an unblocking mold.

463
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:15,240
I think that's right.

464
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,480
But we add now something you and Albert were just saying, or you were attributing to Albert.

465
00:37:19,481 --> 00:37:54,240
It looks like he thinks that if it were the determinate way that the prejudice of the world thinks it is, then we would be, I don't know whether tempted or forced to have the wrong view of perception, that this determinate thing sends out determinate waves that get picked up by my sense organs, which are transfusers, and gets processed in the brain up to the point where I am able to recreate in my experience the determinate object whose information and energy was sent to me.

466
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,121
That's become very hard to resist, I take it.

467
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,401
That's part of the thing.

468
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:11,521
He thinks there's no way to resist that wrong-headed way of thinking about it, except to realize that this is a phenomenal world of appearances which has to be made determinate all the time.

469
00:38:11,521 --> 00:38:22,481
Once you think that, then you're free to have a kind of Walter Freeman neuroscience and a Merlot-Ponty phenomenology of perception.

470
00:38:22,481 --> 00:38:32,560
And you can just say, well, the usual way of thinking about perception and the usual way of thinking about how the how the brain deals with it is just wrong.

471
00:38:33,921 --> 00:38:35,760
But that doesn't give him the right to say it.

472
00:38:36,001 --> 00:38:45,121
I think to say that if you don't hold the view his way, you can hardly resist holding a view which a lot of people like him and me think is wrong is not enough of an argument.

473
00:38:45,121 --> 00:38:45,440
Yeah.

474
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,360
Wait, wait, I'm going to close that door.

475
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,160
There's enough background noise, I can't hear him.

476
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:51,600
Yeah.

477
00:38:52,001 --> 00:38:57,640
If you think that's how we find the unjusted expression of our perception, how long is that?

478
00:38:59,441 --> 00:39:01,481
Maybe I don't really make sense of things.

479
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,840
Let's see what you're saying.

480
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,041
Wait till we get to the chapter on the things.

481
00:39:04,881 --> 00:39:11,480
I don't know whether what you're saying makes sense or not, but it's too hard to go into at this point.

482
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:26,920
He's got, maybe it's true that our view of what it would be like to be a completely determinate house is somehow incoherent or can't be put together with our experience of the house coming into determinacy.

483
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,081
That's, I think, what you're saying.

484
00:39:29,081 --> 00:39:29,960
I don't know.

485
00:39:29,961 --> 00:39:30,840
Keep your eye open.

486
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,361
That's what you should watch.

487
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:40,121
Where in this book and how often and with what sort of arguments is he going to get you over into his idealist camp?

488
00:39:40,121 --> 00:39:41,481
That I don't know.

489
00:39:41,881 --> 00:39:45,480
And as possible paper topic, it's sensational.

490
00:39:45,481 --> 00:39:50,121
If anybody finds the argument and makes it persuasive, that's an A-plus paper.

491
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:53,001
Okay, now back to where we were.

492
00:39:53,001 --> 00:39:55,240
It's going to be hot in here if we close the door, isn't it?

493
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:55,560
Yeah.

494
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:56,840
Close the door again.

495
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:01,001
I'd rather have noise than everybody going to sleep from the heat.

496
00:40:01,481 --> 00:40:02,121
Thanks.

497
00:40:02,121 --> 00:40:03,481
Sorry about that.

498
00:40:03,481 --> 00:40:08,280
Okay, now I'm just going to catch up because I'm already way behind where I want to be.

499
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,961
I don't think this is a waste of time at all.

500
00:40:13,561 --> 00:40:15,561
Let's look at 48.

501
00:40:15,561 --> 00:40:17,240
This is all part of the same argument.

502
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,921
Maybe it'll be helpful.

503
00:40:20,521 --> 00:40:27,960
Against philosophy with two guides and observable in any doctrine of the understanding.

504
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,880
So here's what philosophy has.

505
00:40:29,881 --> 00:40:35,721
A week is undertaken from a naturalistic view which expresses, oh, I see.

506
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:40,121
This, by the way, I just quit sort of vlogging, because this is not his view.

507
00:40:40,121 --> 00:40:41,640
This is a thing.

508
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,160
I wanted to show you a typical not marilo-Ponty passage.

509
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,360
This is listerl.

510
00:40:46,601 --> 00:40:57,281
He says, what you go is, you bring up a subject who is a constituting agent and exists only and the subject exists only for the constituting agent.

511
00:40:57,601 --> 00:41:01,440
And I could be only and so forth.

512
00:41:01,441 --> 00:41:04,721
There's the idea of absolute constituting consciousness.

513
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:09,841
And that's the other side of there being an absolutely determinate universe.

514
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:20,001
And I just want to read the last sentence, because it's interesting when Marilo Ponty is giving you a husseral kind of that's constitution in a very strong idealist.

515
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:34,321
And he says authentic reflection instead of turning from one to the other, that is, the universe is completely constituted, created by transcendental consciousness, or the universe is completely determinate already.

516
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:53,440
Those two views, which are just the subject-object view from Descartes, taken to their natural extreme, he says authentic reflection, that's him, instead of turning from one to the other as both true, that's Descartes, in the manner of philosophy of the understanding rejects them both as false.

517
00:41:53,441 --> 00:42:08,720
I mean, there is no, for him, the idea of a totally constituting consciousness that just sort of puts together objects out of phylody data on the one hand, and the idea of a completely determinate universe in itself, you've got to give them up.

518
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:16,561
That's a subject-object metaphysics, or sometimes later you'll see in the reading, I just want to tell you so you'll recognize it.

519
00:42:16,561 --> 00:42:25,121
He switches over to Sark vocabulary, where a Cartesian subject is a for-itself, and the objects are in themselves.

520
00:42:25,121 --> 00:42:33,281
That that for that subject-object or for-itself, in itself oncology, he's rejecting them both as false.

521
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,721
That's sure.

522
00:42:36,441 --> 00:42:51,961
And he has a right to do that regardless of what the answer to our previous question is, because he can say about these people, they don't understand the process of perception by which we get access to the perceptual world.

523
00:42:51,961 --> 00:43:05,800
And he can, that's a different point than whether the world we get access to by our perceptual process has been determined all along, or whether it being determinate depends on our access to Albert's question.

524
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:13,481
So, what interests us is a story about how we come to have the perceptual world we have.

525
00:43:13,481 --> 00:43:21,561
And then he wants to say, not by being a pure transcendental consciousness, we've got to be embodied in a way that I'm going to come through right now.

526
00:43:24,041 --> 00:43:32,921
And it's not because we are sort of pure open reflectors of a completely determined world and universe which is already there.

527
00:43:33,561 --> 00:43:35,160
That's out of the question.

528
00:43:35,401 --> 00:43:38,200
I mean, I think he makes that case absolutely convincing.

529
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:51,081
I mean, he's got plenty to say against volcano kind of constitutive phenomenology and plenty to say against any kind of behaviorist empiricist information that comes in from the world out there, and the brain just reconstructs it.

530
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,280
Why?

531
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,640
So, let's go on.

532
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,840
The 54.

533
00:43:55,401 --> 00:43:57,400
This is all supposed to be just reviewing.

534
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,841
The 54 one is the.

535
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:10,041
So, now see, again, in the light of this discussion, I'm going to see what extreme views he's got here.

536
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:21,601
He says, at the end of the page, however, the Gestalt psychologists, I quoting Gestalt, who practice the description of phenomena are not normally aware of the philosophical implications, and I don't think that's just epistemological connection.

537
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:30,640
They do not see that the return to perceptual experience, insofar as it's consequential and radical, puts out of court all forms of realism.

538
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:35,680
See, there he goes, James, right, from epistemology to metaphysics.

539
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:44,721
That is to say, all philosophies which leave consciousness and take as given its results, its results being a world and the universe of things in themselves.

540
00:44:45,041 --> 00:44:51,680
The real sin of intellectualism lies precisely in having taken as given the determinate universe of science.

541
00:44:52,401 --> 00:44:54,640
So there we go.

542
00:44:55,601 --> 00:44:58,481
So Elephantine has this view.

543
00:44:58,481 --> 00:45:00,961
I'm going to skim it, but we covered a lot of this in our discussion.

544
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,240
Beware right there.

545
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:08,561
And well, we can get right around, of course, just to remind you of the what?

546
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,601
I've got a page in the old book instead of the new book.

547
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,280
Wonder where the crypto mechanism is.

548
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,960
I'm just going to align through it.

549
00:45:14,961 --> 00:45:17,841
There it is, on page 67 here.

550
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:30,160
This is just the other half of the story that we cover up all this activity of making the perceptual world determinate.

551
00:45:30,481 --> 00:45:41,121
That's the view he's going to hold, and I think rather plausibly, no matter whether the perceptual world is determinate all along or not, the crypto mechanism.

552
00:45:41,921 --> 00:45:43,521
Maybe I'm not making sense.

553
00:45:45,121 --> 00:45:45,920
Let me read it.

554
00:45:45,921 --> 00:45:48,081
Nothing is more difficult than to know exactly what we see.

555
00:45:48,081 --> 00:45:52,880
There's a natural intuition, a sort of crypto mechanism, which we have to break in order to reach phenomenal being.

556
00:45:52,881 --> 00:45:53,440
Oh, yeah.

557
00:45:53,441 --> 00:45:54,960
No, I think I was wrong.

558
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:57,121
I mean, that's another metaphysical claim.

559
00:45:57,121 --> 00:46:12,921
That says that there's something in us that hides this making determinate of the indeterminate and makes us think wrongly the metaphysical view that everything is determinate.

560
00:46:12,921 --> 00:46:18,601
That's how perception hides itself and enables things to be constituted.

561
00:46:18,601 --> 00:46:23,640
That is, makes us believe in the metaphysics of the determinant things.

562
00:46:23,961 --> 00:46:37,080
So and so there is no world, no determinate world, no determinate universe, only our job is to describe the.

563
00:46:37,081 --> 00:46:43,240
And now this could be just epistemological, which would be fine, because that's what he's interested in doing.

564
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:53,160
About five lines down in 66, the first philosophical act would appear to be to return to the world of actual experience, which is prior to the objective world.

565
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:58,121
Now you can hear that prior as necessary in order to get an objective world.

566
00:46:58,121 --> 00:47:00,041
And then that's fine.

567
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:04,680
Remember, I keep saying don't feel that you have to drop the course or give up on marriage fine.

568
00:47:05,001 --> 00:47:06,920
That's for him the interesting issue.

569
00:47:06,921 --> 00:47:23,800
To describe the way our perceptual activity gives us the experience of a determinate objective world and then covers up the activity by which he did that.

570
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,441
I mean, that's that's what the book is about.

571
00:47:26,441 --> 00:47:32,440
All this metaphysics is just him finds a one-up science, I think.

572
00:47:32,441 --> 00:47:41,640
Well, also and also head off a bad account of perception, which you've all driven through if you take the view he doesn't want.

573
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:42,840
So let's see now.

574
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:54,321
There's a shared perceptual world, it's an intersubjective world, and we take it for landing without experience, and we can uh study how we came to have it.

575
00:47:54,320 --> 00:48:01,680
And now I just want to s set strengths and vocabulary that I was not very clear about, although Rick corrected me.

576
00:48:02,001 --> 00:48:04,881
There is a public shared world.

577
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:08,481
Let's call it an intersubjective world.

578
00:48:09,041 --> 00:48:12,160
And he uses that term somewhere, but I give him finds it.

579
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,640
But that means he wouldn't deny it.

580
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:20,640
But it's really not only an intersubjective world we'll see later, it's an intercorporeal world.

581
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:27,520
Because our body organizes it in cooperation with all these, my body organizes it in cooperation with all of you guys' bodies.

582
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:34,320
And if you say intersubjective, that's too much buying into Cartesian thought.

583
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,841
But there is a shared intercorporeal world.

584
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:52,640
Only if you think that's an objective world, he hears that as making a metaphysical claim that there is a completely determinate world in itself already there.

585
00:48:52,640 --> 00:49:04,160
So I last time said this shared intercorporeal world that's got all the stuff into we've got, it's okay to say that's the objective world, but not the way he's receiving it.

586
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:11,521
The objective world for him is a metaphysical misunderstanding, and I had to straighten that out before I think I just did.

587
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,960
Let's see, I have quotes, let's see if I know how many I have to read.

588
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:21,680
By the way, well, here's one that's back a little bit in what I said, about five lines down in 62.

589
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:28,881
He says, the decisive moment in perception, because that's what he wants to talk about, the upsurge of a true and exact world.

590
00:49:28,881 --> 00:49:32,160
I mean, that's what he's interested in.

591
00:49:32,481 --> 00:49:34,920
How that comes into stability.

592
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:41,640
Of course, he's always hearing it metaphysically too, how there comes to be a true and exact world at all.

593
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,160
That's his metaphysical spin on it.

594
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:51,320
And now this is getting to the phenomenal field, the middle of the page.

595
00:49:51,320 --> 00:50:11,961
The criticism of the constancy hypothesis, more generally, the reduction of the idea of the world, opened up a phenomenal field, which now has to be more accurately circumscribed and suggested the rediscovery of the direct experience, which must be at least provisionally assigned its place in the relation to scientific knowledge and psychology and philosophical reflection.

596
00:50:11,961 --> 00:50:25,721
So that's to say, and I keep wanting to stress it, the phenomenal field means that there is some way that we organize experience so that we've got this shared world.

597
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,561
And that's what he's interested in.

598
00:50:27,881 --> 00:50:37,320
And he wants to understand how that phenomenal field is opened up by us in our active bodies.

599
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,081
Did I see a hand back there?

600
00:50:39,401 --> 00:50:40,200
You're right?

601
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,721
I'm like, all right, okay.

602
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:42,680
Let's see then.

603
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,680
62.

604
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:54,601
And he's just against what he's talked about in the next paragraph, that there is a truth in itself in italics, which is the reason underlying appearances.

605
00:50:54,601 --> 00:50:55,960
There isn't any reason.

606
00:50:55,961 --> 00:51:06,201
There may be, maybe in Kant, and maybe he'd be happy with that, some unknowable thing in itself, which somehow puts the boundary conditions on what we can take to be what.

607
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:18,121
But there isn't any world with any content, any description, any structure in itself, accordingly, which explains why we have the experiences we have.

608
00:51:18,121 --> 00:51:21,121
It's got to be turned around and be the other way.

609
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:24,241
Okay, very much for that.

610
00:51:24,561 --> 00:51:36,881
So he wants to, about 66 lines, 66, about six lines down, he wants to return to the world of actual experiences, experience which is prior to the objective world.

611
00:51:36,881 --> 00:51:39,920
I keep repeating this now in the new language we've got.

612
00:51:39,921 --> 00:51:51,441
Well, it's at least prior to it in the epistemological, chronological sense that we've got to keep doing this job before you have it.

613
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:54,481
And he thinks also metaphysically prior.

614
00:51:54,481 --> 00:52:04,640
So skipping down a bit, our task will be to rediscover phenomena, the layer of living experience through which people, other people, and things are first given to us.

615
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,920
You see, that's okay.

616
00:52:05,921 --> 00:52:07,121
That's safe.

617
00:52:07,121 --> 00:52:13,361
The system self, other things is coming into being, reawaken perception and foil its trick.

618
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:26,320
That's the crypto mechanism of allowing us to forget it as a fact and as perception in the interest of the object which it presents to us, the determinate object, and the tradition, which so forth.

619
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,041
Okay, that is all okay.

620
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:33,840
Now comes the whole attack on introspection.

621
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,440
I don't have to say much about it.

622
00:52:35,441 --> 00:52:49,761
I just recommend that you read 66 and 67, because when you tell people that you're doing phenomenology, they will inevitably think you're doing introspection, and they will think that introspection has been shown to be wrong, which he would completely agree.

623
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:58,961
That is, everybody just sitting there inactive, meditating on their own private experiences, get all sorts of weird answers.

624
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:10,360
The different introspectionist schools of psychology got different answers, as I think I mentioned, my favorite is the Buddhist meditating of Varela in his awful book, The Embodied Mind.

625
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:26,121
I wouldn't mind Varela doing his Buddhist meditation and coming up with the idea that there are no selves and no objects, but in that book, the idea is that's what Meriloponte was trying to do when he did phenomenology, but we doing meditation do it better.

626
00:53:26,441 --> 00:53:33,480
But meditation is certainly introspection, and there's nothing further from what Merlopony is doing.

627
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:40,121
He's separating himself for two or three pages from doing introspection.

628
00:53:40,121 --> 00:53:45,801
And he even says, in this nice footnote on 67, that he will begin differently.

629
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:53,640
Pay attention to internal experience and external experience of perceiving subjects.

630
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:59,640
That is, he's interested in how I experience the trees and the mask taking shape.

631
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:07,481
He's interested in sort of a Vishnal description of how a whole population of people all agree that this figure is similar to that figure.

632
00:54:07,481 --> 00:54:09,241
That's all right, too.

633
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:24,041
The one thing I think he's against, and that's the meditation in introspection story, is that you could be a passive, reflective observer of your experience and find out anything important.

634
00:54:24,041 --> 00:54:26,121
Because he thinks for two reasons.

635
00:54:26,121 --> 00:54:35,000
One, you're really an active, engaged body coper, and that's where you find out what's important about experience.

636
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:44,160
And second, reflection modifies what you're finding and gives you false stuff.

637
00:54:44,481 --> 00:55:00,801
So that you've got to be able to unreflectively catch yourself or observe people, it doesn't matter which, in their embodied interaction with the world if you want to find out what he wants to find out, which is the nature of perception.

638
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:06,880
The thing about how reflection falsifies things, I thought was pretty important, so I'm going to look for it in a minute.

639
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,800
We have the footnote here.

640
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,441
Right.

641
00:55:09,441 --> 00:55:15,440
I don't think that for those of you that know that meditation is introspective.

642
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,521
I don't think he's misunderstood.

643
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:28,800
Okay, I think, no, I, well, well, look, I think that Varela thinks that phenomenology, and I talk to Varela a lot about this, that phenomenology is introspection and Buddhism is better than introspection.

644
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,121
But I'll find you the quotes next time.

645
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,840
And if he didn't, that would be terrific.

646
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,320
And maybe he doesn't.

647
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:40,801
I mean, anybody who's got the body mind can try to figure find out.

648
00:55:41,441 --> 00:55:48,720
Okay, so now where reflection in this leads you is on 72, about two-thirds of the way down.

649
00:55:48,720 --> 00:56:00,321
Reflection is truly reflection only if it's not carried outside itself, only if it knows itself as reflection on an unreflected experience and consequently is a change in structure of our experience.

650
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:08,000
So if you want to find out what your experience is, then you don't want to do it by doing something to it that changes its structure.

651
00:56:08,001 --> 00:56:11,761
You'll just find out what happens when you reflect on it.

652
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,601
And so it's what he's doing is not introspection.

653
00:56:15,601 --> 00:56:16,240
This is true.

654
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,881
We'll find out what Varela thinks he's doing.

655
00:56:18,881 --> 00:56:23,520
But what Merlot-Fontee thinks he's doing is not introspection and not reflection.

656
00:56:23,521 --> 00:56:33,600
And it's a tricky job of finding out what our experience is like when we're actively engaged in coping with the world unreflectively, sort of in flow.

657
00:56:33,601 --> 00:56:37,961
Somebody told me they thought this book is all really the phenomenology of sports.

658
00:56:34,961 --> 00:56:39,640
I think that's a nice way to think about it.

659
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:49,160
If sports are people most engaged in the flow, unreflectively, dealing with the world, that's the model Merlot Ponty wants.

660
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:53,561
That's how you find out what it's really like to be a perceiving human being.

661
00:56:53,561 --> 00:57:03,720
So there's a university of sports in Norway, the Chancellor of which is a Merillot Ponty scholar, and they're big fans of Merilo-Ponty.

662
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,960
And Merlot Ponty would be happy with that.

663
00:57:06,441 --> 00:57:06,921
Yeah.

664
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:10,601
I just want to think about the photograph analogy.

665
00:57:10,601 --> 00:57:19,481
It seems like this leading to me because it seems like the K-Doint photograph is an objective capture of our things.

666
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:26,680
But it's like the camera process is built to replicate our optimization.

667
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:31,881
And we build in replicates our retina structure.

668
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:38,041
And then the chemistry re-release of our sensation.

669
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,081
It's not a reflection of our perception, so we have to interact.

670
00:57:41,081 --> 00:57:45,720
But if the photography, like the fly candy, I say, well, let's not go back to that.

671
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:46,840
I mean, you're right.

672
00:57:47,481 --> 00:57:49,080
But yet, it's true.

673
00:57:49,081 --> 00:57:56,041
The photograph is doing the, what do you call it, getting this, the sensation, it's getting the sense impression.

674
00:57:56,521 --> 00:57:57,400
What's these words?

675
00:57:57,401 --> 00:58:00,360
I'm going to be remembering the constancy hypothesis.

676
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:05,561
What's on the film is like what's on the retina.

677
00:58:05,561 --> 00:58:12,760
And the question then becomes sort of, and what does that tell us about perception?

678
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:19,320
And Merylot Ponty would have to say not much, because the role of what's on our retina isn't what people think it is.

679
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:25,840
It isn't sort of giving us the picture of the world, which needs to be cleaned up and fixed up a bit.

680
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,600
And when it gets to the highest level, we'll have a good picture of the world.

681
00:58:29,601 --> 00:58:30,720
Now, I don't want to go back.

682
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:35,680
Just that time is really running out and I'm very far from where I want to be.

683
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:39,601
74, not infrospective.

684
00:58:39,601 --> 00:58:40,241
Okay.

685
00:58:40,561 --> 00:58:48,321
And then you can have an objective science of your prior, of first-person experience.

686
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,320
Pearl says that rightly.

687
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,000
The Gestaltists understood that.

688
00:58:52,001 --> 00:58:53,121
That's what they were doing.

689
00:58:53,121 --> 00:58:55,521
And Merylo-Ponty's footnote says that.

690
00:58:55,521 --> 00:58:58,961
There's no problem with that.

691
00:58:58,961 --> 00:59:18,640
Now, the important thing is, and that's what I don't want to miss, that when he starts this chapter on the phenomenal field, we're now finally to the phenomenal field, which is, I'm going on next time, by the way, no matter what, go read for next week the problem of the body, at least that first section of the problem of the body.

692
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:24,561
I hope to get to the Phantom Limb talk next week, so try to get over the weekend, try to get through that assignment.

693
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,200
It's 30 pages, it's not impossible.

694
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,761
But now, here we are in the phenomenal field.

695
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:36,321
And he starts by telling you about a whole bunch of affordances, which are nice, but we can just run page 60.

696
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:43,201
Then he tells you about how things afford, well, what?

697
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:45,360
Well, and anti-affordances.

698
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:48,960
A child sees a candle, is repulsive once, he gets burnt by it, and all that.

699
00:59:49,521 --> 00:59:56,081
This is just good Gestaltist and uh Gibsonian-like talk.

700
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:03,680
What I want to focus on is 61, this, which struck me as important in the time I was reading it through, the third line.

701
01:00:03,681 --> 01:00:07,480
Sense experience on the other hand, well let's see what on the other hand watch.

702
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,841
Well there's no pure quality.

703
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:09,961
He said that lots of times.

704
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:13,961
Sense experience on the other hand, which are not like sense data.

705
01:00:13,961 --> 01:00:18,200
That would be pure quality, red patches here now.

706
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:21,480
Sense experience is responding to affordances.

707
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:25,160
Sense experience invests the quality with a vital value.

708
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:29,160
Yeah, you know, to eat, to walk on, to run away from.

709
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:38,440
Grasp it first in its meaning for us, for that heavy mass which is our body, whether it comes about that it always involves a reference to the body.

710
01:00:38,761 --> 01:00:41,240
That's a sentence which I think is interesting.

711
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:47,320
The first thing is, it's so important that all of this is done in terms of its vital value for us.

712
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:53,160
And I don't particularly like that jargon, but it's the same point I keep wanting to say.

713
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:57,961
It's our engaged experience when we're trying to cope with the world.

714
01:00:57,961 --> 01:01:00,360
We're trying to get a maximum grip on it.

715
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,880
That's the bottom line for him.

716
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,920
And he'll come, I'll give you other quotes.

717
01:01:06,921 --> 01:01:12,041
By the way, just for fun, you should look at the idea of that heavy mass that is our body.

718
01:01:12,041 --> 01:01:17,560
Have I ever told you this TOTUS thing about why I've got body and world on the list?

719
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:25,320
I mean, if you keep your eyes open, you'll see that Merillau-Ponty never tells you what the body is like and never makes any use of it.

720
01:01:25,961 --> 01:01:33,881
As TOTUS said to me once, I mean, if a Martian read Merleau-Ponty, he wouldn't have any idea what human beings were like.

721
01:01:33,881 --> 01:01:37,240
They would just be this sort of heavy mass that moves around.

722
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,001
That's the one thing the body does.

723
01:01:39,001 --> 01:01:43,560
It moves around in order to get a better look at things and a better grasp of things.

724
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:56,880
But a batted body has a front and a back, an up and a down, a right and a left, and it moves forward more easily than backward and copes with things that are in front of it and balances in a gravitational field.

725
01:01:56,881 --> 01:01:59,280
All this is what TOS is interested in.

726
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:03,520
It's super important that Merlot-Ponty, you can't do everything at once.

727
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,640
He hasn't really got an idea of the body.

728
01:02:06,641 --> 01:02:18,800
The body for him is, it is the capacity to respond to the solicitations of things, and the solicitation of things are their vital significance to me.

729
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:26,240
It's to get the affordances, get a grasp on your coffee mug, or be able to walk out your door.

730
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:29,520
So now, let me go more about that.

731
01:02:29,841 --> 01:02:32,160
I'm trying to get a better grip on my world.

732
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:35,041
I experience there's always promising the world.

733
01:02:35,121 --> 01:02:40,320
Well, the perceptive world is promising me more, calling me to follow solicitation.

734
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:44,160
And I'm partly repenting my previous time teaching this.

735
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:49,680
And for years, I've said, well, the point is to have a set to go around the house, for instance.

736
01:02:49,681 --> 01:02:50,800
Let's talk about a house.

737
01:02:50,801 --> 01:02:56,560
But you're set to do, if you go around the back, around trying to go see the map, if you think of that.

738
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,001
If you can take it, and so forth.

739
01:03:00,001 --> 01:03:04,480
I think that's not capturing the vital values, Joy.

740
01:03:04,721 --> 01:03:08,001
It's not that I'm simply set to see more.

741
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:13,760
And this is the slogan that you've got to keep in mind all the time in this part and everywhere.

742
01:03:13,761 --> 01:03:19,280
I'm not just set to see more, I'm not just ready to see more, I'm drawn to see better.

743
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:23,041
That's the vital norm that he's built in.

744
01:03:23,041 --> 01:03:29,520
That we're always drawn to get a better view, more detailed, firmer group.

745
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,280
And that makes everything different.

746
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,400
That turns all this talk into talk about norms.

747
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,280
It's always not a question just of other possible perspectives.

748
01:03:35,121 --> 01:03:41,480
It's always a question of better perspectives.

749
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:49,560
And I went, if you look at the primacy of perception, you'll see that that's the crucial point of the article.

750
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,880
I'll just call your attention to it.

751
01:03:51,881 --> 01:03:58,600
He says perception can't be understood in terms of possibility or necessity.

752
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,520
Take that with a house.

753
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:11,081
If you're a Husserlian, you think that you've got a mental structure of a house and it shows you the necessary, tells you the necessary properties.

754
01:04:11,081 --> 01:04:14,440
Like, for instance, it's necessary that it's a house that will have a back.

755
01:04:14,761 --> 01:04:19,081
That's not what perception is.

756
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:22,041
Well, maybe it's then got to do with possibility.

757
01:04:22,041 --> 01:04:23,801
Then you get to somebody like C.I.

758
01:04:23,801 --> 01:04:35,640
Lewis, who sort of converts the husseral position of this meaning that tells you the necessary structure of a house to possibilities.

759
01:04:35,641 --> 01:04:37,560
If I go around, I'll see the back.

760
01:04:38,121 --> 01:04:41,640
That makes the back not a necessity, but a possibility.

761
01:04:41,641 --> 01:04:44,200
But Meryl Fonte says the neither is right.

762
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,280
The back is an actuality.

763
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:52,600
But that connects with his constantly thing, which I stress, saying, remember, it's the presence of the back that matters.

764
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:55,720
It's the presence of what's under the spaker family.

765
01:04:55,721 --> 01:04:59,480
How something can be concealed but present.

766
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,720
And that's what we're worrying about.

767
01:05:01,721 --> 01:05:08,200
And he says, so the back of a house isn't necessary, and it isn't possible.

768
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,160
It's actual.

769
01:05:09,641 --> 01:05:11,800
He has all kinds of words for this.

770
01:05:11,801 --> 01:05:12,841
And real.

771
01:05:13,961 --> 01:05:14,440
Real?

772
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,160
Yeah, real.

773
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:16,121
Not actual.

774
01:05:16,681 --> 01:05:17,160
Really?

775
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,600
You are really actual.

776
01:05:18,841 --> 01:05:19,081
Really?

777
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:21,121
Okay, I've misremembered it.

778
01:05:21,121 --> 01:05:22,240
I haven't read it for a while.

779
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,680
So it's actual.

780
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:26,160
So not necessary or possible, but actual.

781
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:32,560
And I'm just trying to call your attention to the fact that this is tied up with all this talk about vital things.

782
01:05:32,961 --> 01:05:36,480
One more passage on 61, about 12 lines down.

783
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:44,961
Sense experience is that vital communication with the world that makes it present as a familiar setting of our life.

784
01:05:44,961 --> 01:05:48,320
See, it's not just looking at the world.

785
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:55,520
It's not, it's got this thing he called vital communication is constantly trying to get a better grip.

786
01:05:56,081 --> 01:06:00,961
It is to that that the perceived object and perceiving subject owe their thickness.

787
01:06:00,961 --> 01:06:06,640
It is the intentional tissue, which is, which the effort to know will try to take apart.

788
01:06:06,641 --> 01:06:11,280
Intentional tissue is another word for the actual or the real.

789
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,760
I mean, it's supposed to be, or thickness.

790
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:17,280
These are all words for the same thing.

791
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,721
And I had another one that I wanted to.

792
01:06:21,841 --> 01:06:24,961
But the point is, it looks like it has a back.

793
01:06:24,961 --> 01:06:26,160
Yeah, that's right.

794
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,041
It doesn't matter.

795
01:06:27,041 --> 01:06:28,480
This is not telepathy.

796
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:31,680
I talked to Rick about this before office hour yesterday.

797
01:06:31,681 --> 01:06:37,041
But the point isn't whether you can tell from the front of a house whether it's a facade or a house.

798
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,881
That would be telepathy.

799
01:06:38,881 --> 01:06:40,640
That would be impossible.

800
01:06:40,641 --> 01:06:42,720
That would make illusions disappear.

801
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:49,761
If you've been on a set in which you've seen lots of facades, then you don't even have to believe it's a facade.

802
01:06:49,761 --> 01:06:51,041
You're just taking it.

803
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,961
You just take the next building as a facade.

804
01:06:53,041 --> 01:06:53,761
It looks like that.

805
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:57,280
And if you take it as a facade, it looks like a facade.

806
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,440
Or if it looks like a facade, you take it as a facade.

807
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:00,560
The other way around.

808
01:07:00,881 --> 01:07:01,520
Both.

809
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:05,880
I mean, once you've been surrounded by facades, you see facades.

810
01:07:05,041 --> 01:07:08,041
And that means that it looks thin.

811
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:17,001
And if you've been walking down a normal street with normal houses and you don't even notice you've walked onto a movie bed, then it will look thick.

812
01:07:17,001 --> 01:07:22,200
It will look like that not only does it have a necessary back and a possible bag.

813
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,720
He isn't denying that.

814
01:07:23,721 --> 01:07:29,160
It also looks, and this is the important thing, like it has an actual or real.

815
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:39,720
And when it doesn't, right then, not just deductively, has to be there, necessary, not just possible that if I go around I'll see it, but actually there.

816
01:07:39,721 --> 01:07:49,160
And he can only get that argument going, and that's what I want to be expressing, when he brings in this vital function.

817
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:50,680
That is the vital functional.

818
01:07:50,681 --> 01:07:53,800
There's another, I know what I'm looking for, my last chance here.

819
01:07:53,801 --> 01:07:57,881
There's another fascinatingly obscure passage which I think I can make sense.

820
01:07:57,961 --> 01:07:59,560
It's got to do with practicity.

821
01:07:59,801 --> 01:08:01,160
Let me look over here.

822
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:12,121
By the way, there's this whole history of modern philosophy from 62 to 65, which is fine and brilliant, really French achievement.

823
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:14,121
But it's just like a French philosophy paper.

824
01:08:14,121 --> 01:08:18,041
You could skip it and you wouldn't hurt anything for your reading again.

825
01:08:18,041 --> 01:08:20,280
So there's the world going up well.

826
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:21,400
Okay, 71.

827
01:08:21,641 --> 01:08:23,160
I think the vital thing comes back.

828
01:08:24,121 --> 01:08:27,001
Yes, at the top of 71, that's the last thing I'll read.

829
01:08:27,001 --> 01:08:28,280
I've got one minute.

830
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:45,001
If then we want reflection to maintain in the object on which it bears its descriptive characteristics and thoroughly to understand the object, we must not consider it as a mere return to universal reason, this is old stuff, and see it as anticipated in unreflected experience.

831
01:08:45,001 --> 01:08:48,200
We must regard it as a creative, be careful there.

832
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:57,520
That just means articulation, operation, which itself participates in the facticity of that experience.

833
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:00,160
Now, I thought that was fairly obscure.

834
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:12,081
What it means to participate in the faculty, in the facticity of the experience, is you are solicited by a call to get it better.

835
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:15,121
I think that's what it's got to mean.

836
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:25,121
And that's why there's a place now where he says that we there's no separation between us and the world.

837
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:27,440
I think I have to give up.

838
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:28,881
It's too bad, Isaac.

839
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:33,200
There's no separation between us and the world.

840
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,041
Oh, well, let me, here, quick.

841
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:43,840
Notice it's not Merlot-Ponty from the middle of 69 to about 50 lines down on 70.

842
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:46,720
And then it says, now the phenomenal field.

843
01:09:46,721 --> 01:09:49,121
He says, the weed reveal.

844
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:53,200
And now, if I could just find what there is, this interesting.

845
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,921
He talks about, it's the vital point again.

846
01:09:55,921 --> 01:09:58,480
I'm going to read the chunk starting in the middle of the page.

847
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:03,600
But although the Gestalt is fast for a while, it may be expressible in terms of some internal law, and so on.

848
01:10:03,681 --> 01:10:06,320
Their experience is not the external unfolding and so forth.

849
01:10:06,641 --> 01:10:17,600
It's not because the form produces a certain state of equilibrium, solving a problem, the maximum coherence, making a world possible, that it enjoys privileged such and such, skipping down.

850
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:21,520
It is the birth of a norm and is not realized according to a norm.

851
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:27,520
It is the identity of the external and internal, and not the projection of the internal to the external.

852
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:33,680
That norm talk and identity talk is this vital significance call.

853
01:10:33,681 --> 01:10:53,081
That is, there my being solicited to cope with something and something showing up as having importances for me to cope with is the essential is the total interconnection between internal and external.

854
01:10:53,081 --> 01:10:56,840
So it doesn't even make sense to talk about internal and external anymore.

855
01:10:56,841 --> 01:10:57,961
Okay, I did it.

856
01:10:57,961 --> 01:10:58,680
I talked too long.

857
01:10:58,681 --> 01:10:59,240
I'm sorry.

858
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,121
I'm stopping.
