1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,639
Well, then I want to start by discussing issues that came up when Rick talked and that came up in a message that Alva sent to Rick by email, which you haven't seen, but which will come into the discussion, and things Alva said to me after what Rick said when we had lunch.

2
00:00:17,639 --> 00:00:19,640
And there are so many important issues.

3
00:00:19,639 --> 00:00:22,120
What is not important is idealism.

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,640
We are not going to talk about idealism anymore until the last lecture.

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:37,159
I have Merlot-Ponty on my side where he says at some point, I think I may have referred to this already, it won't be until you get to the time chapter that you can understand what I think about this.

6
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:41,080
It's where he's doing his crypto-mechanism act.

7
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:44,760
And what's your position?

8
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:45,799
My position?

9
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,080
What difference does it make?

10
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,800
And I'm just saying.

11
00:00:48,759 --> 00:01:03,080
No, all I'm going to say is that whatever it is that he is, he doesn't think he's convinced you of that position until the time chapter, which is, of course, very hard and practically incomprehensible, which you would expect, given the complexity of this issue.

12
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:09,159
But we just, it's just, it's fascinating, but one, it's too early to discuss it.

13
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,199
And two, no matter what he is, it doesn't matter.

14
00:01:12,199 --> 00:01:20,279
Because what's important is he's a terrific phenomenologist who's got an amazingly original and deep and convincing view of perception.

15
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:24,680
And whether he's, whatever metaphysics he holds, doesn't matter.

16
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,279
It's the phenomenology.

17
00:01:26,279 --> 00:01:29,159
That's why we don't want to go back and talk about it anymore.

18
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,360
Not even what I'm saying.

19
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,960
Cancel what I just said.

20
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:54,440
Because we're going to go right into the issues, the phenomenological issues, and also psychological issues that got raised in the, and that means I want to talk about the Gestaltis and Gibson, because that was sort of on the margin of what Rick was saying, and it was what interested me and Alva centrally.

21
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,560
So let's see where we are.

22
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:04,879
And I want to relate it to the phantom limb, which is how it came up in a way, at least between me and Rick and Alva.

23
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:16,879
That is, the question is, if you got rid, if you lost your limbs, would cups still afford grasping and floors still afford walking on?

24
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,319
That's the question.

25
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,639
It's partly a question of definition and of making the right distinctions.

26
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,560
But I can't just jump into it.

27
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,680
I have to go over it step by step.

28
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,600
It's a remote, sort of go back.

29
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:40,720
I'm sort of trying to go on with my lecture about the phantom limb and integrate it as we go with what Rick said and what came up afterward.

30
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,120
So we're on 43.

31
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,959
One of the things we want to understand is near the bottom of 43.

32
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,040
I'm afraid I can't tell you any other book, but you will have the accord.

33
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,079
37.

34
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:54,480
Okay.

35
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,360
Yeah, 37.

36
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,079
You might as well use it.

37
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,639
How many people are using the book that doesn't have the page numbers?

38
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,919
Most of us have.

39
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,999
Okay, well, just shout out from your concordance for those of you.

40
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:10,879
But here he says, this is near the bottom of 93 for us.

41
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,919
It's a huge paragraph and no footnotes, so that can't help you.

42
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,719
43.

43
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:15,759
93.

44
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,840
Did I say 43?

45
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:18,639
That doesn't help any.

46
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,360
81.

47
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,480
81.

48
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:30,879
All I want to say is that the fact we want to consider is he tries to walk with his phantom leg and is not discouraged even by a fall.

49
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:37,519
And now the first thing is, is just to understand what's going on there.

50
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,439
Well, obviously what's going on there is the floor still looks walkable on.

51
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:49,159
Now you might want to also say, and the leg feels still walkable on.

52
00:03:50,040 --> 00:04:02,040
But that's tricky because there isn't it isn't as if your leg normally feels walkable on and you stop and it still goes on like that.

53
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,879
It's in the background.

54
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:09,399
It's not an experience like that you're directly aware of.

55
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:25,959
And it's and because it's in the background, I think Merloponte wants to say, if you stop believing that you've got a leg to walk on, that doesn't mean that you won't still try walking on the floor and fall over.

56
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:33,079
Because it isn't as if that belief is what's keeping you in the circuit of the world, as Merloponte would say.

57
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:41,879
It's that in the background you have the sense of the power to walk, that that's something sort of diffusely in your body.

58
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:48,199
And that sense of the power to walk doesn't go away just because your leg went away.

59
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:54,439
And it doesn't go away even if you believe that you recognize that you don't have a leg.

60
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:59,560
And he's talking about this at the bottom right after this.

61
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,199
But he can describe quite well, in spite of this, the peculiarities of the phantom limb.

62
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:14,680
And if he treats it as a real limb, this is because, like a normal subject, he has no need when he wants to set out walking, have a clear and articulate perception of his body.

63
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,839
It's not some body image.

64
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:27,999
It's not some kinesthetic experiences that he has or hasn't got.

65
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:32,480
He's got an overall fence that he can get around by walking.

66
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,399
And since it's just in the background, it's very hard to get rid of.

67
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:47,360
Going on, it's enough for him to have at his disposal as an undivided power and to sense the phantom limb as vaguely involved in it.

68
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:57,680
And so that's why it doesn't go away when he loses it and believes that he's lost it.

69
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,240
And because it continues in the background.

70
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,759
I'll read you one more quote like that on the next page of our quote.

71
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,520
This is getting right before the next paragraph, ten lines before the next paragraph.

72
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:28,079
The refusal of mutilation in the case of the phantom limb or the disablement and agnosia is not the deliberate decision and do not take place at the level of positive consciousness which takes up its position explicitly after considering various possibilities.

73
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:30,720
That's just another point.

74
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,800
So now that now I tried to organize this lecture, but I couldn't.

75
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,040
There's just sort of a branch point here.

76
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,400
I want to ask the question: what is it that continues in the background?

77
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,120
What is this power, this vague power?

78
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:59,840
And I'm going to get to that, but I was going to put that aside now and talk specifically about the issue about whether the floor affords walking and the cuffs afford grasping when you haven't got an arm or a leg.

79
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:06,760
And I'll come back in a little while to this thing which I've left vague and he leaves vague at this point.

80
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:18,520
Just exactly what is this background sense of having this power, which is my being in the world by way of my body.

81
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:18,920
Yeah?

82
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:27,000
I don't want very well close, but if you could explain for those of us who haven't taken Heidegger and Hanspond background, I just try to articulate it in the way that.

83
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,280
Oh, I see background.

84
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,400
Well, it's not in Heidegger.

85
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,920
He uses the word maybe three or four times in his Nietzsche lectures.

86
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:40,360
I had to make a lot of effort to show that my reading of the background into Heidegger was not absolutely arbitrary.

87
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:46,759
I don't know who uses the term background to technique and Surreal as a regular important concept.

88
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,240
Do you?

89
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:48,839
What?

90
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:49,640
Husserl.

91
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,839
Husserl.

92
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:53,160
Well, they're the horizons, yes.

93
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,760
The Hintergrund.

94
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,319
The Hinter.

95
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,199
Ah, the does he talk about the Hintergrund?

96
00:07:59,079 --> 00:07:59,880
Where?

97
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,719
Well, that's something to look at.

98
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,839
I didn't know that, or I must have known it because I read it once, but I probably didn't think about background then.

99
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:18,840
The person who put background, I think, into the foreground, so to speak, was Wittgenstein, who talks about the background a lot in on certainty, the last book he wrote.

100
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,040
And it's a kind of background acceptance of the world.

101
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:24,199
It's very Heideggerian.

102
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,520
In German, it's the Überkommene Hintergrund.

103
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,639
It's the kind of background which you just take over and inherit.

104
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,800
You don't have to have it ever explicit.

105
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:37,719
Okay, now, and what is it?

106
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:48,280
Well, it's what you always are taking account of, and you're taking account of, or not even that's already wrong.

107
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:59,920
You're taking account of things, but you're doing that always on the basis of something else, which one would like to say is a belief system.

108
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,719
Then it would be nice.

109
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:04,240
You could just spell out the belief system and you can imagine what a belief system is.

110
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:08,880
It's a whole network of beliefs that that Searle used to talk about a lot.

111
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,200
And I don't think he does much anymore.

112
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:21,600
But the background, as Searle is very clear in saying, isn't a bunch of, which he gets from Wittgenstein on certainty, it isn't a bunch of beliefs.

113
00:09:21,599 --> 00:10:35,360
It's the taken for granted way you have of behaving and what you pay attention to and what's what what is stands out for you in w in your experience the same thing and uh I don't know how to say much more about it it's your overall way of coping with things I would say you could try to say it's what you take for granted but then again that sounds too conscious and too explicit and you could sort of you might think you could make a list of things you took for granted but you couldn't make a list of the background so I don't know if that helps any it's very hard to talk about but and it'd be very interesting Olivia if you can tell me where to look in experience and judgment I will look at where Husserl sounds like the very first chapter the very first chapter yeah okay look I mean usually when Husserl talks about horizons and not background then it's not very much like this because his examples are that this building is on the horizon of the city that has the city of Berkeley on the horizon and it becomes a pretty different story about what you o it's like the back of the house is on the horizon of the house.

114
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:46,199
It's what you're not explicitly directly seeing, but which you're already taking for granted of, for granted, or what was already showing up in what you're seeing.

115
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:58,600
Useral has an understanding of that to some extent, but usually puts it in terms of this kind of spatial horizons, which not a very helpful way to put it.

116
00:10:58,599 --> 00:11:03,800
But if he has the notion really of background, is it a Gestalt notion of background?

117
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,680
I'm so intrigued that he's...

118
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:12,439
What you say is true, because Uster means by background, this was behind the house sort of thing.

119
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:16,520
But then he can hear a secretary in speech with a concept of style.

120
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,080
Style?

121
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:19,320
Yeah.

122
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:21,479
Okay, I've got to go look at it.

123
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:24,040
That really is nice.

124
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:34,999
I don't usually find things in Useral that I like, but experience and judgment is one of the most close to Heidegger and close to things that I do like.

125
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,759
So I should go look.

126
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,360
Anyway, let's not get sidetracked.

127
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:43,080
This is just telling you why it's hard for me to tell you much about the background.

128
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,600
Did it help?

129
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:45,079
Okay.

130
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:46,600
So.

131
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:57,640
It's worth it's worth just noting that the term background isn't used by Merle Ponty, but he has these funny terms like a vague power when he's talking about the body and so forth.

132
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:04,439
I don't know what do you think the general term for that does the job of background is in Marielau Ponty.

133
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:14,840
Of course he's got the Gestalt term, ground, but the ground is different than the background because the ground is just what you're not paying attention to when you're paying attention to the figure.

134
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:28,319
Now it's true that the ground of the the that the Gestaltists and Marilo-Ponty talk about is related to this other background, except that it's interesting.

135
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,520
The Gestaltist and Merlot-Ponty ground can be made into a figure.

136
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,479
You can notice it.

137
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:36,800
You can pay attention to it.

138
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,720
But the background, he calls it an atmosphere later in the Cogito chapter.

139
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:50,319
It's totally like the water to the fish, and you can't turn it into a figure.

140
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,760
You can sort of pay attention to it and spell it out as a bunch of beliefs.

141
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:05,120
So when Merlot Ponty is saying ground, he's not going to be using this kind of term, the Wittgenstein kind.

142
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:06,640
We're not using anything.

143
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,959
But you see, here, I think he's actually not articulating this notion.

144
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:12,160
You don't think so?

145
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,759
Well, when he's talking about the fastened length, he's talking about his sense of his having the power, the power to walk.

146
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,560
Right.

147
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:22,000
But it's part of the way he has that power.

148
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,479
I think, let's go look, is as part of this general something or other that you've got when you've got a body.

149
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:31,199
It might become clearer in the chapter which we're going to get to.

150
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:32,079
So let's make me change.

151
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,680
No, no, it's the body.

152
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,720
The body has this peculiar background character where it's everywhere and you can't, it isn't a question of belief.

153
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:49,120
And you it's like an atmosphere, you take it with you, so to speak, wherever you go.

154
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,800
Okay, that's okay then.

155
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,840
We are all we stay on the same wavelength.

156
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,360
So here we are.

157
00:13:55,599 --> 00:14:04,160
Now, I said I would put aside what, not I wouldn't have put aside what the what what the word background means, and I'm glad you asked me now.

158
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:16,040
What I'm putting aside is what, how much does Meryloponty fill in this notion of background so as to give you some kind of sense of what he's talking about.

159
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:22,600
What is it that's always there taken for granted in everything you do?

160
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,360
What can you say about it?

161
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:27,399
And is correlative with your body and so forth.

162
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,960
I'll come back to that because it's something I think Alvin and I disagree about.

163
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:33,880
But I'm not sure what the answer is.

164
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,800
I want to give it to you as a puzzle later.

165
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,760
Okay, but now, so let's go back.

166
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:58,359
Even if I manage to free my tendency to grasp the cup and walk on the floor, then re-educate my arms and leg, as they sort of take them out of this general power and cancel them, which I can do with lots of practice of changing my habits.

167
00:14:58,359 --> 00:15:13,240
Remember, there is somehow an autonomous current running from the leg, and it's just normally for Meryl-Ponty, just part of this general coping stance I've got.

168
00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:20,920
But I can separate it out and learn to not believe it, so to speak, not act on it.

169
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,479
You have to relearn.

170
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:31,959
I mean, I know you re-educate people who haven't got legs and arms, and eventually, I presume, they stop standing up and falling over.

171
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:44,280
Just as I presume, and I'm always trying to find a phenomenon in our experience, remember I said when the electricity fails, my arm at least goes out to every light switch as I go into the room to look for the flashlight.

172
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,919
It's absurd, but it's part of the general power I've got to get light.

173
00:15:48,919 --> 00:16:00,639
But I presume, though I haven't done it, that after doing that for, I don't know, a week or a month or whatever it takes, my arm will stop going out towards the light switch in every dark room I enter.

174
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:03,839
That just won't draw me anymore.

175
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,999
And you can, so that's all right.

176
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,880
You can educate yourself finally to not do this, it will stop looking graphical.

177
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:25,119
I think Merrill Punch is talking about this on 95, about halfway down, right before the paragraph begins, in that way, the phenomena is absorbed into that of repression.

178
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:51,999
By the way, I didn't put it in the paper topics finally, though you shouldn't, if you like, if you take up the phantom limb issue in your paper, which is such an interesting one, from 95, when I've said this, to 99, he's talking about repression and psychological issues, which he talks about a lot more and a lot better than the Cogito chapter.

179
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,200
Just parenthetically, this won't mean much to you, but I've gone this far.

180
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:08,399
He's got this fascinating idea that what somebody doesn't know, which the normal psychology counts as something repressed, he thinks it's something that's gone into the background.

181
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:12,399
So he turns death psychology into breadth psychology.

182
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:20,879
When something becomes so pervasive that you can't even make it an object anymore, it's gone from your consciousness, but it's controlling your life.

183
00:17:20,879 --> 00:17:26,159
And he can redo psychoanalysis in his terms.

184
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:27,040
And he does.

185
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,879
And he's starting on it here, but don't pay any attention to it.

186
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:40,479
Skip it if you want to, where it says in that way on 95 until the paragraph on 99, which says, now why does the severing of the sun-sex nerves?

187
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,800
We'll get back to the other one later.

188
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:54,280
But I was going to read now on 95, just before in that way, he says, how can I perceive the objects as manipulable when I no longer manipulate them?

189
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:00,280
Manipulability must have ceased to be what I am now manipulating.

190
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:00,680
What?

191
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:05,560
The manipulable must have ceased to be what I'm manipulating and become, oh yeah, that's a whole other thing.

192
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,639
But that's very relevant to this discussion.

193
00:18:07,639 --> 00:18:09,879
What one can manipulate.

194
00:18:09,879 --> 00:18:16,040
That is, emphasize now, how can I perceive objects as manipulable?

195
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:20,439
Anyway, perceive objects when I can no longer manipulate them.

196
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:31,879
And this is now the question that Alva raised after my lecture when I said that cups would stop looking graspable, would stop affording grasping.

197
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,719
I'm not saying true things now.

198
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,479
I'm saying things that I said.

199
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:42,839
And Alva said he didn't think that was so, that they went on looking manipulable.

200
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:45,560
And I think the answer is yes and no.

201
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,159
You need a distinction.

202
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:51,399
And one way to make the distinction is what Merlot Ponte Neck says.

203
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:54,920
And I'll tell you another way to make it in what Rick said.

204
00:18:54,919 --> 00:19:01,479
But here he says the manipulable must have ceased to be what I'm now manipulating and become what one can manipulate.

205
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,680
So you see the idea.

206
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:09,079
You look at a cup, and it's still certainly what one can grasp, if not what I can grasp anymore.

207
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:10,520
That's what he says here.

208
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,720
And I have this capacity to see things the way one normally sees them.

209
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:21,079
It must have ceased to be a thing manipulable for me and become a thing manipulable in itself.

210
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:22,440
He's got no objection to that.

211
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:31,839
Correspondingly, my body must be apprehended not only in an experience which is instantaneous and so forth, but also in some general aspect in the light of an impersonal being.

212
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:49,439
Well, that's just to say that I am capable with my body of doing and seeing things the way anyone with a body does and sees things, as well as having my particular body, which if I've got certain very good skills I can do that nobody else can do.

213
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,999
And if I've lost a limb, there are things that I can do that everybody else can do.

214
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,719
But there's also a level of what one generally does when one has a body.

215
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:07,999
Now, that's another way to talk about this, and that gets us to Rick, is Gibson on affordances.

216
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,479
You ask yourself, well, does the cup still afford grasping to somebody who hasn't got an arm?

217
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,560
And there I thought what Rick said was extremely illuminating, a distinction I had never thought of.

218
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,440
But it seems to be a very interesting and important distinction.

219
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:32,159
It's the distinction between what the Gestaltas would say about the cup or somebody who's lost their arm and what Gibson would say.

220
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:49,040
If afford grasping means is generally graspable by organisms with bodies like ours that can grasp things, then it's something, a cup is something one grasps, and you don't lose that.

221
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:53,040
It doesn't lose that when you lose your arms.

222
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:58,639
That's because it's really there in the world that the cup affords grasping.

223
00:20:58,639 --> 00:21:02,319
And that's how Gibson's going to use the word affordance.

224
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,839
Well, what about the Gestaltas?

225
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,520
Are they just wrong?

226
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,319
No.

227
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:08,800
And Rick was saying this.

228
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,359
The Gestaltas say, ah, but there's something else.

229
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:14,199
There is the solicitation.

230
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,599
The cup does not draw me anymore to pick it up.

231
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:26,839
I'm now assuming that I've reconditioned my habits and I've gotten re-educated toward my amputation.

232
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:36,520
Then the cup does, it still looks affordable because one can pick it up, but it doesn't look, it doesn't solicit me to grasp it.

233
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,679
I think that's the important distinction, right?

234
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:41,639
So a good example of how to use it is bait.

235
00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:47,479
So it looks easable and delayed when we're hungry, but then most of the telecommunication dogs are buying you to eat it.

236
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,879
So we just make that distinction.

237
00:21:49,879 --> 00:21:56,760
And then there's still something left in Alvis' question, which I'm not so clear about, though I don't know how to settle it.

238
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:58,839
I have a strong feeling about it.

239
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,839
Let me see if I've done what I want to do here.

240
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:06,760
Now let's read the top of 95, because here's where the Gestalt thing comes in.

241
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:15,959
Now Fonte is sort of talking about both these issues, and he knows there's a distinction, and he distinguishes it by bringing in what one does and what I do.

242
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:36,119
But at the top of 95, he says, it is precisely when my customary world arouses in me habitual intentions that I can no longer, if I've lost the limb, be effectively drawn into and be usable objects precisely insofar as they present themselves as usable, appeal to a hand which is no longer I no longer have.

243
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:41,719
So that is this drawn into is the solicitation business.

244
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,760
I can't be drawn into it anymore.

245
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:59,679
Now, the question I have, and that may not be the best quote, I'm sure there would be better ones, because he certainly does have a sense that objects solicit me to pick them up or walk on them or eat them or drink them or whatever.

246
00:22:54,919 --> 00:23:03,520
Now, the question I don't know the answer to is: do they look different?

247
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:14,240
My hunch is that once you reconcile yourself to having no arm, cups look different.

248
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,879
They look different exactly in the way that you would expect them to look different.

249
00:23:18,879 --> 00:23:21,439
They don't attract you to pick them up anymore.

250
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,679
And attracting you to pick them up is a very interesting sort of form of visual experience.

251
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:39,200
It's of the same interesting sort as how the back of how the front of a house can attract you to go through the front door into the house with a facade that looks exactly the same.

252
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,040
It's been built to look exactly the same.

253
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,560
That's what it will look like in a movie.

254
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,439
You won't be able to tell the difference between it and a house.

255
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:56,239
To you, with a body moving around, either the front door looks like something that's inviting to go into, or it looks just flat and you'll bump your head if you try to go into it.

256
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,439
That's a different look, according to this story, I think.

257
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,919
And if you can believe that look about the door of a facade and of a house, you ought to be able to believe it about a cup, too.

258
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:11,040
A cup stops, and now it's just a question of language.

259
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,040
Looks is clearly ambiguous.

260
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:17,280
A cup still looks like the kind of thing that one drinks from.

261
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,800
Can't get rid of that.

262
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:25,520
But a cup does not say to pick me up, drink from me to you when you've got no arms.

263
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,679
That's how I want to do it.

264
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,040
Does that sound right to you?

265
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,599
I'm not sure we haven't had a chance to discuss it.

266
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,999
I find it crazy to say that a house looks different from a girl.

267
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,560
Well, I see.

268
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,400
Well, if you question that, we have to go back to lunch.

269
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,760
I mean, I think that's very important.

270
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,119
No difference about it.

271
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:46,600
Yeah, sure.

272
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:48,760
Right.

273
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,879
It's not best described as a difference in the book of the thing.

274
00:24:53,879 --> 00:24:59,479
Because there is no visible difference, as you said at the example, between the facade and the actual house.

275
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,360
I think they really present the story of God.

276
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,760
You're falling into the stimulus error.

277
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,160
You mean that there's no difference on your retina.

278
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:08,600
There's a big visible difference.

279
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:10,919
At least you can't just say there's no visible difference.

280
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:16,199
I say the back of a beautiful girl is visibly different than the back of a guy with a beard and a mustache.

281
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,199
But you were just you were equally attracted to the guy.

282
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,479
Oh, of course I was, because I thought it was a girl.

283
00:25:23,879 --> 00:25:24,919
That's not the point.

284
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:26,280
We're going to get that clear.

285
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:30,999
This is not magical.

286
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,560
This is not clairvoyance.

287
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,120
It's not a question of what, and it's very important.

288
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:39,639
If you don't make this distinction, of course it comes out sounding like, oh, look.

289
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:54,599
It's not a question of whether you could tell when you walk up to a building-like thing, whether it's a facade or a house, or when you walk behind a human being, you can tell whether it's a man or a woman.

290
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:57,959
The question is when you, and now it's tricky.

291
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,679
You don't want to say believe, because that already gives the game away to the intellectualists.

292
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:08,600
I mean, then there is some kind of sense datum and a belief that it's the back of a man or a woman.

293
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:09,800
That's not the point.

294
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:22,839
It's when you're set to see, given the whole ambience of your past experience with backs and long hair and so forth, when you're set to see a woman, then the back looks like the flat back of a woman.

295
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:25,919
And when you're set to see a guy, it looks like a guy.

296
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:31,359
And just to repeat it boringly, if you're on a set in a movie, there's no point on setting it up.

297
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,240
When you're in a movie, maybe there is.

298
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:48,319
Anyway, when you're a movie fed and you've got it, you've been going into the facade business all day and you walk out and you see a real house, it's going to look like a facade to you, because this is not a question of clairvoyance.

299
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:51,600
And when you're walking down the street, all the houses look real to you.

300
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:56,319
Even the facade looks like you could walk right in at an attractive open front door.

301
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:09,919
But the issue is, given what you are, and the best word I know for this is anticipated, already, facades I claim are visibly different than houses.

302
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,599
And certainly that's what Merlot Ponte claims.

303
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,040
We're not, I don't think, disagreeing about interpretation.

304
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:31,439
The whole book would be different if Merle Ponte thought that there was something called the visual experience that was the same in entities that I took for beautiful girls from the back and entities I took for Harry Men from the back.

305
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,879
That would be different.

306
00:27:32,879 --> 00:27:33,359
Okay.

307
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,520
By the way, let's open the windows.

308
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,599
It's not raining and there's no air.

309
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,919
I think, well, can some of you open them too?

310
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,920
I mean, if it gets too cold, close them again.

311
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,319
But every once in a while, a little air wouldn't hurt.

312
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:46,639
Yeah.

313
00:27:46,639 --> 00:27:51,999
Yeah, it's nice to say, having personal experience where every semester, we live in this house, right?

314
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,120
There's a bunch of rooms.

315
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:55,599
Every semester, we shift into a different room.

316
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:57,520
Now, it takes me about three weeks.

317
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,679
Like, I'll pull open fire.

318
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,759
I'll go into my old room to find a key.

319
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,280
Right when I'm about to put my key into the keyboard, then it fits me that this is not my room.

320
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,079
And here it's a little bit more.

321
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:08,879
Yeah, three weeks.

322
00:28:08,879 --> 00:28:18,359
And three weeks later, though, that old room does not give the importance of environment or welcomable.

323
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:21,319
Okay, well, look, now you've gotten to the crucial point.

324
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,240
I mean, you're taking my side.

325
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:33,319
I mean, it's not a question, I thought you were just repeating the sort of the obvious boring points of the light switch or whatever, that it takes you a while to get your body to recognize that the world is different.

326
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:40,280
But if you tell if you're telling me now, and moreover, when your body does recognize the world is different, the world looks different, which is what you're saying.

327
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,719
The room doesn't look inviting and comfortable anymore and so forth.

328
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,319
That's well, that's what I think.

329
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:47,319
And that's what Merlot Conte thinks.

330
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:52,040
And it's so important that it's sort of amazing to be going over it again and again.

331
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,399
But let me just repeat.

332
00:28:53,399 --> 00:29:00,520
The only alternative view I can see is that you have a sense data of some sort.

333
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,599
It's the given.

334
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:05,480
And then you have an interpretation of that given.

335
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,159
Now, let me just put it in terms of the body.

336
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:10,040
You can go back to the guy and girl again.

337
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:18,599
In this story, the given stays the same, but you have an interpretation in one case that there's a woman and expectations of one sort.

338
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:23,719
On the other, you have anticipations, let's say better, of the other sort.

339
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:32,040
But when you go around and looked and you drop behind again, it's the same visual experience you're having.

340
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,040
It's just the different interpretation.

341
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,959
So there is an identical sense datum in the two cases.

342
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,719
That's the thesis that Merlot Conte denies.

343
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,839
That's a version of the stimulus error.

344
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:48,119
Or it's a version of the indubitable given error.

345
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:51,239
There are all kinds of reasons to think it.

346
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,919
And finally, it's a question of phenomenology.

347
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:56,720
That's what's sort of depressing in a way.

348
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,280
I mean, I don't know.

349
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:05,520
If Algo goes on insisting that it looks the same to him when he drops behind, and that visually is the same, he's got a different interpretation.

350
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:07,200
I don't know what to say.

351
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,920
We'll have lunch and talk about it so far.

352
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:10,639
Yes, James.

353
00:30:10,879 --> 00:30:17,839
I mean, I think not that many people would deny the phenomena of what you're talking about, but I think there is an issue of how to describe it correctly.

354
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:22,719
And one way, I don't know if it's admissible to bring up the notion of content of a visual experience.

355
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,240
Yes, I think that's all right.

356
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,600
I mean, I don't know.

357
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:28,399
How many feel comfortable with the notion of intentional content?

358
00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:31,839
I mean, that's really amount of time that people have had Searle, I guess.

359
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:32,720
Or maybe others.

360
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,040
How many have come in any of your courses come across the talk of intentional content?

361
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:39,839
Not all that many say it, but I think it's.

362
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,399
Well, I just wanted to ask you, I mean, would you say that the content, the visual content, is different?

363
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:44,960
Totally.

364
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,599
And notice, and Searle is so helpful here.

365
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:52,319
I mean, Searle, we gave a seminar in which Merlot Ponty was in it.

366
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,399
We were teaching it together.

367
00:30:54,399 --> 00:31:01,839
And Searle always gets, when he gets one of these things, he sees what's really interesting and he grabs it and runs with it.

368
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:11,040
He comes up with the idea then that visual experiences have intentional content and the visual experience of a house has different content than the visual experience of a facade.

369
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,119
He's got no question about that.

370
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:24,399
Now, that sounds right to me, but I can't, and there's no reason to think intentional content meaning sort of what you are, never mind.

371
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,160
Well, or if I exactly what it means.

372
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:27,760
Yes.

373
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:28,959
That's all guys.

374
00:31:29,879 --> 00:31:33,839
The choice between, well, it all needs to do with the sense types of me.

375
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:43,479
Because we have viewings which you basis of the guys for the girls has the same content that he has.

376
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:46,040
And you don't even know what you're saying in terms of it.

377
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,639
But that doesn't require that the content you have, the shared meanings or anything like that.

378
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:56,839
It's in the question of where you put the marker down between the leaf and digitally screen.

379
00:31:57,159 --> 00:31:58,040
Oh, hey.

380
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:02,680
I mean, that marker seems to be not this isn't just a linguistic question.

381
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:08,119
I mean, somehow or other, we're trying to discuss whether it looks different afterwards.

382
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:18,439
And you could say, by digital experience, I mean all that part of your experience with is the same under both those key years or something.

383
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,400
I don't know what that would be, but that's what I mean.

384
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,599
There is a further funny complication in this, which I guess I'll mention.

385
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:41,000
It sort of function, because Lewis saw, finally, that you came to believe the Gestalt point that houses and facades actually looked different.

386
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:50,359
This could have been a disaster to his epistemology because the point was to find the perceptual given.

387
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:56,119
And the perceptual given was what was supposed to be indubitable because you hadn't put any interpretation on it yet.

388
00:32:56,119 --> 00:33:00,919
And then you can interpret it as the back of a man or back of a woman or in front of a house or a facade.

389
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,240
And then, of course, it isn't indubitable anymore.

390
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:05,400
You can turn out to be wrong.

391
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:19,880
So at that point, a philosopher that no one's ever heard of, and rightly so, I think, but was my thesis advisor nonetheless, as Reverend Roderick Firth.

392
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,799
Firth saved Lewis.

393
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:36,960
He got hired at Harvard, got tenure at Harvard because he saved Lewis by saying what's indubitable is the seeming to see the back of a beautiful girl or seeming to see the back of a man.

394
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,479
And then it's related to you.

395
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:45,680
That is, in other words, put the interpretation into the experience, into the intentional content.

396
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,960
What happens there is the two issues come apart.

397
00:33:50,000 --> 00:34:04,640
You can keep the indubitability and the Gestalt point by saying that the given is seeming to see such and such, because that's still indubitable, that you seem to see a house, even if it turned out to be a facade.

398
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:11,520
But that's got in it the claim that it looks different when it seems to be a house than when it seems to be a facade.

399
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,839
So Lewis took that.

400
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,840
And we don't care because we're not doing epistemology.

401
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,599
And there are probably lots of issues in there.

402
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:30,560
But that's the way you could go if you wanted to preserve the indubitability.

403
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,079
But notice what you give up.

404
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:40,640
You'd give up that anything was the same across the two backs, seen when you knew which they were.

405
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:47,200
Because what would be, well, nothing's the same between seeming to be the back of a beautiful girl and seeming to be the back of a hairy guy.

406
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:54,719
It turns out that they're totally different visual experiences now on Firth's Gestalt's view.

407
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,800
He was influenced by Hurler.

408
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:06,639
And but if for your epistemology, you're all right because you haven't made any claims that will be refuted since you haven't claimed that they are the back of blah, blah, blah.

409
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:10,279
Okay, I gather that Stroud taught Lewis, the way he's epistemology.

410
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:12,920
How many took the epistemology course and Stroud was teaching Lewis?

411
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:17,319
So bringing Lewis back out of total obscurity is not completely crazy.

412
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:19,560
But we don't want to spend too much time on this.

413
00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:23,480
You already said something, you already said something, unless it's vitally important.

414
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,440
I want to go on.

415
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:26,599
Yeah, I do need to say one thing, yeah.

416
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:47,000
Um there's I'm not sure what the best way to put this is, but you yourself, second ago, I think you have the real tension, which is that both Leopard T and CI Lewis recognize that they're confronted by the same problem.

417
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,079
That you have a sense in perception of something that you don't really see, that's not a view.

418
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,759
And you don't want to say that, so C.I.

419
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:03,000
Lewis uses intellect, cognition, to get from what is given to what is experienced.

420
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,560
So what is the OKP whenever it gets together?

421
00:36:10,279 --> 00:36:20,920
But when it comes to Leopardi's view, you say the same thing, only you add science lecture, which is anticipation, it's set, something like that.

422
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:27,000
But he's using a mechanism to bridge the gap.

423
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:39,719
So, see, if what you said was right about the interpretation of Little Panti, that from the very start, we are aware of the housiness of what we're seeing rather than the facilities of what it is.

424
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,319
It would sound the very starting sense that you don't know what object we're talking about.

425
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:52,200
But in the phenomenology, if you were really immediately given a house and not the sky, then there would be nothing to be explained in terms of set.

426
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,959
Because set you're going to be what gets you from the given to the house in the facade.

427
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:01,679
So phenomenologically the climate perception is explicit.

428
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,879
She just says, in what sense am I aware of the back side, right?

429
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:12,079
But that means another just in straightforward sense.

430
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,560
Oh, and I wouldn't put it that way.

431
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:20,320
I'd say, in what sense does the back side visible in the front side, what do I need to account for that?

432
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:26,400
Right, and it means something exactly something which performs the function, which the intellect is function.

433
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,039
Yes.

434
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,560
Something has to explain.

435
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,520
And I see what you mean.

436
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,400
That's right.

437
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:38,640
Something has to explain how you can, if you do, see the whole house from the front as opposed to see the front of a house.

438
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:45,519
And that gets explained by people like Marilo Ponty in terms of set and readiness.

439
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,200
But now there's a whole new peculiar move, an important move.

440
00:37:49,199 --> 00:38:06,400
It isn't as if Marilyno Ponty thinks that there is some common visual thing and that between seeing a house and seeing a facade, and then which you're set to do plays the role of the mental interpretation.

441
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,040
He thinks that it never even happens.

442
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:17,599
That you have the it isn't sort of something you got and something else, your anticipations, your sets and so forth.

443
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,000
You got your anticipation from the start.

444
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:30,480
But don't confuse this with the com you know, confronting a building and you don't know which it is and you're right on the border of the of the movie lot, and it could be a house, and it could be, of course, then you don't have it from the start.

445
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:56,680
But if you're just walking down the street, you don't have to get first the visual experience and then the set, Marilo Ponty thinks, since since the whole determines the parts, and since the other thing we need, the sense in which I'm already open to a world determines the experiences, if I'm in a city on a street, the facades just start showing up.

446
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:02,759
Now, and here's the way to put it for you, and this is interesting, and Merloponte is somewhat confused maybe about this.

447
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:03,880
I'm not sure.

448
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,040
There are two ways to hear the set story, or the anticipation story.

449
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:23,960
One is, first there's, I mean, not first chronologically, but just basically, there's this experience, and then thanks to the set, it gets this thickness, or it has this thickness.

450
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,920
Sometimes Merlot Ponty talks that way.

451
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,320
He shouldn't, and he doesn't later.

452
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:47,720
Because what you really ought to say is, and this is, I think, the way I'll put it, I put it to myself, if the cup looks reachable, it's equally okay to say that it looks reachable because I'm set to pick it up, and I'm set to pick it up because it looks reachable.

453
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:50,680
You shouldn't give any priority to the body in this.

454
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:55,720
You shouldn't, because that makes it look like, just what you're saying, and Merle Ponty comes dangerously close.

455
00:39:55,719 --> 00:40:02,119
There's something like the experience and then the set that makes it look thick.

456
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:09,560
But you wouldn't have the experience on the Merleau-Ponty picture except when you've already got the set.

457
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:33,760
Because you're always already, if the intentional art talk, you're always already taking in whatever's coming into you on the basis of your past experience with houses and on the basis of your recent experience with particular streets and particular houses so that there's so that it comes in, you could say, already pre-processed by that.

458
00:40:33,759 --> 00:40:35,359
And now I don't know what to say.

459
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,520
I mean, but that's that's very helpful the way you just put it.

460
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,760
Okay, but that that then means there is no problem about the present.

461
00:40:41,759 --> 00:40:42,799
There is no problem.

462
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,319
Well, he's present.

463
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:44,960
That's what he does.

464
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,399
What do you mean there's no problem?

465
00:40:46,799 --> 00:40:59,119
It means that from the start, the back of the house is given to you in the way I put it, in the way the front of a house looks, as that which is conveyed by the front of the house.

466
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:06,640
Yeah, yeah.

467
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:07,199
I think.

468
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:09,199
Let's go to the end say something, and we got to go on.

469
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:15,519
This is but this is something if you don't get this ground floor picture, you're nothing is going to be helpful.

470
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:29,119
How would you analyze this volume where you look at a building and I know as a matter of fact that it's a real building in past experiences, but when I see it from a certain angle, it looks like thought that a dust was building will bring you on.

471
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,639
And this I've experienced with a set of friends at this particular building where I live.

472
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:35,919
But at this angle, it looks like a facade.

473
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,880
And we know as a matter of fact that they don't know the building.

474
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,880
It's interesting.

475
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,040
You'd have to figure out what it means.

476
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:48,000
It's got to mean that it looks like a tough blood painting instead of like a building, the way you described it.

477
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,880
Is that right?

478
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,599
It looks like you couldn't go into the front door.

479
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,680
You just smash against the wall.

480
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:55,599
And that's how it looks to you.

481
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:01,760
Even though from past experience you know that it's a a building with an interior and all that.

482
00:42:01,759 --> 00:42:04,959
I I don't know what to think about that.

483
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:05,799
It's not just me.

484
00:42:05,799 --> 00:42:07,119
We're part of my paper.

485
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:10,199
Well, I want to go see it.

486
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,639
Take me to see it.

487
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:13,000
I'll think about it then.

488
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,480
Okay.

489
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:15,560
Now, I'm going to go on, right?

490
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,119
Okay.

491
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:17,319
Because it's amazing.

492
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,040
I'm still on page one, but this is important stuff.

493
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,440
Okay, I don't know whether they look different or not.

494
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,239
All the things they don't look different.

495
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,560
I think they do look different.

496
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:32,839
I've now given you sort of the way it looks that Meryl-Ponty wants to think about it.

497
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:34,680
I think I have to go on.

498
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,920
And now where do we go on?

499
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,759
To son, okay, it's totally related what happens next.

500
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:49,719
I want to go, I said I would come back to what exactly is going on, so to speak, with that background that he's talking, that he doesn't even call the background.

501
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:51,400
What is this atmosphere?

502
00:42:52,040 --> 00:43:02,919
In fact, what is, in his jargon, what is the being in the world, which is neither subject nor object that is the condition for there being subjects and objects.

503
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,439
That's his talk.

504
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:17,079
Notice his Heidegger talk, but as some of you had Heidegger know, it's radically different than Heidegger talk because he thinks ants have being in the world, and Heidegger thinks only human beings have being in the world.

505
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:24,759
Although I could show you a place to make your hair stand on end where Heidegger talks about snails having being in the world, I think he must have just lost it for a minute.

506
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:26,760
Not in being in time.

507
00:43:26,759 --> 00:43:57,280
But any case, Meryl-Ponty, but Meryl-Ponty and Heidegger both think that there is this global something or other, which is our openness to the world, which is prior to, in some very basic phenomenological sense, that it's always already there and makes it possible for us to encounter anything, objects and people and houses and so forth.

508
00:43:57,279 --> 00:44:02,240
And I'm trying now to say a little bit more about what that is, because that's very important.

509
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:39,760
So in the case of the phantom limb, it comes up because he wants to say all inputs to the body, which come down nerves, of course, like all visual stuff, which has to get there by way of the retina, all these nerve impulses and what look like the reflex reactions to them, if you're going to talk about walking now and not perceiving, get their meaning insofar as they fit into the organism's whole way of relating to the world.

510
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:41,520
That's the first thing to say.

511
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,360
That's what he certainly thinks.

512
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:59,839
That's the sense in which, just to keep the elements, the thing to me, that's the top-down whole determines Hart's theory on the level of the mechanism of the body, in this mechanism of the body chapter.

513
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:22,560
The body as object and mechanism turns out to have the top-down character that Gestalt say it does, that any impulse coming in on any nerve already gets interpreted as it comes in in terms of the whole, whatever whole, the whole set to do things, I think it is, of the organism.

514
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,000
That's crucial to this whole discussion of the phantom limb.

515
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,679
But do you remember he keeps saying it's not a question of the for itself or the in itself.

516
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:33,119
It's not a question of something conscious and mental and in a subject.

517
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,079
It's not a question of something mechanical in an object.

518
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:38,319
It's got to be a third kind of being.

519
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,079
That's so important in him.

520
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:48,680
And the third kind of being is this holistic, top-down, already on a background characteristic of all experience.

521
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,720
That's the point I want to make.

522
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
If the whole determines the elements, and if the elements are nerve impulses, okay.

523
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,599
If they're reflexes, it's okay.

524
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:00,279
There are no real reflexes, he's saying.

525
00:46:00,279 --> 00:46:07,400
In effect, reflexes always happen on some meaningful stance that the body has.

526
00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:16,519
So the organism is always set to respond to specific solicitations on the basis of its overall response to the environment.

527
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,440
That's the thesis.

528
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:28,520
Now, we're getting so far, I think, and I haven't deviated from Merlot-Ponty, but I'm going to deviate, or at least I'm going to say something controversial, dive in.

529
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:32,760
But why does it respond to certain solicitations and not others?

530
00:46:32,759 --> 00:46:36,039
Why is it attracted this way and not that way?

531
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:42,519
Well, because at any given time, it's trying to cope with this or that.

532
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,799
I mean, this is back to Rich's point.

533
00:46:43,799 --> 00:46:46,759
If it's thirsty, it's going to respond to the solicitations of water.

534
00:46:46,759 --> 00:46:49,800
And if it's hungry, of steak and so forth.

535
00:46:49,799 --> 00:46:50,920
That's fine.

536
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:56,040
But there's this, but what is this global threat in the background?

537
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,560
That's the crucial thing.

538
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,919
That's what I'm trying to define.

539
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,680
That's the being in the world.

540
00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:13,320
Well, that's when I say, and I think he says something similar, though I wouldn't know what words he uses, but the organism is always set to cope, always set to find its way about in the world.

541
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:28,879
And now I just want to go a little further and say, and I think it's in him, that the organism is always set to get an optimal grip on things, to balance itself, to not fall over, to get reach for the object and not miss it, and so forth.

542
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:43,599
Ultimately, the whole, which determines the meaning of the elements, and this, which is called being in the world, is this tendency to achieve a maximal grip.

543
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:52,560
Now, I know Alva thinks that I'm reading maximal grip in, and I say I'm not sure that I'm not, because he only said optimal grip three or four times in the whole book.

544
00:47:52,560 --> 00:48:00,079
But there are, but when he's doing the phantom limb, he's awful close to it saying things like that.

545
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:06,400
And I'll find them in a minute where I want to talk about them.

546
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:18,879
Well, maybe I should now just go, no, I think instead of that, I'm going to go now and lay out the rest of the phantom limb chapter, which I would definitely do in the next half hour.

547
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:23,200
Let's hope that I dare, because we're supposed to be going on to motility.

548
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:24,399
So let's do it.

549
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:31,760
So starting on page, we're now on page 89, in sort of the middle of the phantom limb.

550
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:44,240
So we discovered the chapter that begins, what's to be understood is what we're trying to understand is how the psychic determining and the physiological conditions gear into each other.

551
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:53,200
Well, that's this issue of what sort of other mode of being is there that gets these two modes of being to relate to each other at all.

552
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:58,160
And that's just another way of putting, you need this third thing, and he says this in the middle.

553
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:12,680
Even to objective processes like nervous influxes, which belong to the realm of the innate cell, and cogi-tationes, that's the cogito mental stuff, such as acceptance and refusal and so forth.

554
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,159
They're the order of the for itself.

555
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:17,160
They've got to get together somehow.

556
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:24,920
And then he says, finally, that they've got to have some meeting, which is what he calls at the end of the paragraph the middle term.

557
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,279
That's the new kind of being.

558
00:49:26,279 --> 00:49:29,000
I'm just telling you where he says what I said he said.

559
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:44,999
And when he gives you an example of the new kind of being, it's a kind of maximum grip story, because he then says, well, it's always got to do with the fact that we are engaged in an activity which is doing something.

560
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:49,720
I mean, what are we actively ready to do?

561
00:49:49,719 --> 00:49:55,720
Well, in the insect case, that's why you keep thinking being in the world goes clear down to insects.

562
00:49:55,719 --> 00:50:00,040
The insect is trying to use its powers to get around in the world.

563
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:05,800
And if you tie up one of its limbs, it'll use another to get around in the world.

564
00:50:05,799 --> 00:50:16,520
Because what it's trying to do is get a grip on things, and it'll use, if you've got, if it's got, if you've got two arms and somebody ties up one of them, you'll use the other.

565
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:20,439
And if you've got six legs and somebody ties one of them, you'll use the others.

566
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,520
And that's the power he's talking about about 15 lines down.

567
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:29,160
The insect continues to belong to the same world and move in it with all its powers.

568
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:32,280
And why does it do it?

569
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:48,280
Well, you get, when he tries to tell you that, that there is this current activity flowing toward the world through the nerve, he gives you the soap bubble story of the soap bubble solving a maximum and minimum problem.

570
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:56,720
And I think that he thinks that the insect is solving the maximum minimum problem, what he calls the vital problem.

571
00:50:56,719 --> 00:50:58,320
What's the vital problem?

572
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:06,079
It's not just to stay alive, it's to be successfully, actively coping.

573
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:09,200
And it says that, I'm in the middle of 90.

574
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:16,400
Thus, what is to be found behind the phenomenon of substitution of one limb for another is the impulse of being in the world.

575
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:25,280
Well, the impulse of being in the world, I think, is to solve the vital problem, is to get a grip on things, to stay alive.

576
00:51:25,279 --> 00:51:35,200
And that's, and the point, I hope you can see this because it took me till this time to see it as clearly as I think I see it now.

577
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:49,119
When he talks about there being some kind of special nerve impulse going down the nerve to the leg and coming back again, and it can't be just mechanical, and it can't be just mental.

578
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:54,480
It's always the idea that the nerve impulse is trying to do something.

579
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:59,199
It's trying to get this grip, and therefore, that's the third thing.

580
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:02,400
Well, just a third point.

581
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,960
It's not the, you have to understand the organism has a whole good.

582
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,679
I know, I have to say the other half.

583
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:10,799
We've each got half.

584
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:16,879
The organism is trying as a whole to get a grip, and right now it's using that nerve impulse to do it.

585
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:22,239
That's why you can say a current, because he's got this phrase that I've been spending years trying to figure out.

586
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:25,200
A current of existence is going down the nerve.

587
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:26,400
What can that mean?

588
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,999
Well, just what we said together.

589
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,079
Just what we said together.

590
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:37,680
From the top down, namely the organism trying to get a grip, it happens to be using right now that nerve to do it.

591
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:42,200
So you can, and you have to be able to see it that way to understand the phantom limb.

592
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:47,719
And so you talk about the current of existence going down the nerve.

593
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,279
The existence of the whole organism.

594
00:52:50,279 --> 00:52:51,159
Yes, the current.

595
00:52:51,560 --> 00:53:18,119
Well, it's the whole organism trying to be in the world, trying to exist, trying to get a maximal grip, I think, which is now using that limb because it hasn't got another if it's the insect, or using that limb because even though you haven't got it, if you're a phantom limb person who doesn't know it yet, there's a current of existence going down that nerve because it's got, when that nerve fires, it's got a meaning.

596
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:19,480
It signifies something.

597
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:25,159
The nerve is firing the way it's firing because the organism is trying to do something.

598
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:29,480
And what it's trying to do, I think, is to get a grip.

599
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,399
So we could agree about that.

600
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,599
I think that's so important.

601
00:53:32,599 --> 00:53:33,319
It's so hard.

602
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:46,759
I mean, I think if anybody, unless you're a lot smarter than most people, I think, if somebody came up and said, this is a crazy book, he talks about an impulse of existence going down the nerve.

603
00:53:46,759 --> 00:53:49,880
What in the world could that possibly mean?

604
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,999
And it's taken me till this time to think I now do get it.

605
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,360
And I think it's interesting.

606
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:58,280
And it's a version of the top-down story, which is the structure.

607
00:53:58,279 --> 00:54:09,720
Or it's a version now, remember, of how being in the world is there in the background, always determining the significance of what goes on.

608
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:32,000
And also of every impulse that you that you uh use when you act, and also every bit of uh light and energy that comes into your sense organs, all are being determined top-down by what the organism is trying to do, or crying is too mental, what the organism is just led to do in the world.

609
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:39,680
And remember, just to put it extremely, that the organism is led to do what it does in the world because of the world.

610
00:54:39,759 --> 00:54:40,879
I'm going to say that again.

611
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:53,840
I mean, it's it isn't just coming from the from the organism and the nerve, but the nerve is trying to the organism is trying to get a grip on the extremist statement of that to the point of complete madness.

612
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,879
I wasn't even going to read it, but it's so weird.

613
00:54:57,199 --> 00:54:58,079
Where is it now?

614
00:54:58,799 --> 00:54:59,679
I can find it.

615
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:02,639
It's the last sentence of, I think, the previous chapter.

616
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:03,360
Yes.

617
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:05,440
It's weird on 83.

618
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,679
I thought it must be the French, but it's not.

619
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:08,560
It's there.

620
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,599
So let me read this.

621
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:14,079
The last sentence on 83, the last sentence of experience and objective thought.

622
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:34,479
And since the genesis of the objective body is only a moment in the constitution of the body, the body, by withdrawing from the objective world, will carry with it the intentional threads that we're talking about, linking it to its surroundings and finally reveal to us the perceiving subs, the perceiving subject as the perceived world.

623
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:43,440
Well, either that's a miscreant in the French, because you would think he was going to say, I will reveal to us the perceiving subject and the perceived world.

624
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,320
But no.

625
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:45,520
No, he says that.

626
00:55:45,520 --> 00:56:05,599
He says, and that's because we are just this openness to these affordances, and that there's nothing else but my power to respond to them, and uh that's why there are these affordances, but also that's uh how that's why there's me.

627
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:12,920
For those who know being in time, it's it's just his version of this amazing sentence, Dasein is its world existingly.

628
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,199
That's that's it.

629
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:30,440
I mean, the if you sort of empty out everything from the mind except this power to get a grip, and everything from the world, except that it solicits you to get a grip, then the perceiving subject the the perceiving subject is the world perceived.

630
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,039
That's and vice versa.

631
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,919
I mean, it's quite mad, and he just dumps it there.

632
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,279
He needs a lot of explaining.

633
00:56:36,279 --> 00:56:36,520
Yeah.

634
00:56:36,759 --> 00:56:42,199
That's this understanding being in the world as being this overarching structure as you objective.

635
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:46,440
And so the structure doesn't have an isolated part, which is an organism.

636
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,719
They're going to pay for it anymore.

637
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:51,319
The whole structure is made by being in the world.

638
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:51,960
That's right.

639
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,039
That's good.

640
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:54,680
That's good.

641
00:56:54,679 --> 00:56:55,799
That's what I want to say too.

642
00:56:55,799 --> 00:56:56,599
But I it helps.

643
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:59,480
It's not kooky, it's just no, I'm just half joking.

644
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,919
It's it's not kooky.

645
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,439
It's it's it's deep.

646
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:07,880
I think it's right, but it's hard to get used to if you've been a Cartesian all your life, as we all have.

647
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:20,119
But what is kookie, at least by how can do but hyperbirds, is what the objective world means in context of Well, how does this maybe we could in that sense, let's see that sentence.

648
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,839
Where's the objective world?

649
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,679
Oh, the constitution of the object.

650
00:57:24,679 --> 00:57:42,359
By the way, the objective world will carry with it because of a sort, namely that the objective world is something which depends on there being this overarching thing.

651
00:57:42,679 --> 00:57:46,439
You can you can't you'd be misleading to put it the way he puts it.

652
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:50,200
As if there were an objective world already and we're just withdrawing from it.

653
00:57:50,199 --> 00:57:57,520
Well, I think he wants to highlight the contrast between the objective world as scientists generally understand it, with live, removable, or practice.

654
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:59,599
Yeah, in which level of it.

655
00:57:55,239 --> 00:58:01,759
In which you don't even want to say in which objects show up.

656
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:07,840
You want to say something neutral, like in which things show up for us, which is what he did, their whole chapters on the thing.

657
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:13,440
I mean, because that's and it's all in terms of this overarching structure.

658
00:58:13,759 --> 00:58:17,760
The things show up and our bodies show up for us.

659
00:58:17,759 --> 00:58:21,360
And let me say one more thing, which sort of gives you an intuition of this.

660
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,079
We sometimes behave as subjects.

661
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:25,119
We do have beliefs.

662
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:27,200
He's not denying that.

663
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:36,160
And we sometimes encounter objects which we then have to interpret or feed up or try to make into something useful or something.

664
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:50,560
But those are kind of us limited cases where something is, in a certain sense, going wrong with the normal way in which this whole thing just works.

665
00:58:50,560 --> 00:59:05,359
And I'm involved in flow, in coping, in which I'm not having beliefs about it or needn't have, and in which I don't confront objects with properties that I have to make use of and turn into equipment, but I'm just pouring myself into the equipment.

666
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,640
I'm just flowing through the world.

667
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:14,319
And that's when the distinction between me and the world just disappears.

668
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:19,999
That's what happens when you find you reveal the perceiving subject as the perceived world.

669
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,040
Subject goes into quotes too, like object.

670
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:37,119
At its best, another way to put it, that at its best, for all organisms and for us too, I say for us too, because we can become subjects in objects, while most organisms, ants can't.

671
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:45,000
But for all organisms, when they're doing, when they're doing what they're doing best, namely coping, there isn't any distinction between subjects.

672
00:59:45,159 --> 00:59:47,160
There aren't any subjects and objects at all.

673
00:59:47,159 --> 00:59:50,519
And subjects and objects are sort of the limit that you can go to.

674
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:55,240
It's sort of like in my picture, there's this being in the world.

675
00:59:55,239 --> 01:00:01,240
And there's sort of a direction over here where you get to be more or less a subject under some conditions.

676
01:00:01,239 --> 01:00:04,840
And over here, you may get to be more or less of an object under some conditions.

677
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:09,720
And then you may even have some kind of Cartesian question about how to get subjects and objects together.

678
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:17,319
But all of that is completely derivative from and within this third thing, this third kind of being.

679
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:19,720
Where is somebody I saw a hand back there?

680
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,000
Yeah, I'll be.

681
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:36,119
Yeah, what it is that from a consource study, you get an experience and judgment, the fact that the objects are just constituted by the consciousness, and that one has to have the design that is not going to say that.

682
01:00:36,119 --> 01:00:38,840
Not nearly all about T, but obviously.

683
01:00:41,239 --> 01:00:56,999
Since he said that one has to remember that these constituents, we give their independent being, we give their independent being, sort of this in itself for us being to the objects around us by moving our body.

684
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,599
And this is what Resource says, in thing in space and in experience and judgment.

685
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:13,160
It's when he's doing it, it seems to me, that's just when he's not being true to his own Heideggerian ideas, because that gives too much priority to us and our bodies, it seems to me.

686
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:19,759
When we really do it, when he's doing it right, it's in the field of being in the world, of the openness of the organism.

687
01:01:19,639 --> 01:01:26,159
Oh, well, okay, good.

688
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,439
He's often doing that.

689
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:38,560
Oh, I meant to tell you, by the way, good thing, something that you should be careful of when you're reading the next assignment, which is going to be, because I'm not going to get to it enough to tell you much about it, but I'll get there next time.

690
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:43,119
But on 103, the experience of the body in classical psychology.

691
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:44,879
That's really Husserl.

692
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:51,199
And he's not, and it's interesting, I'll be interested to see what Olivier studies this Husserl Merloparte connection thinks about it.

693
01:01:51,199 --> 01:02:03,920
It stays pretty much Husserl, at least until 105, where there's this footnote where he talks about God is never completely constituted, and then he refers to unpublished Husserl manuscripts.

694
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:15,119
But it isn't as if he's agreeing with it or disagreeing with it, but it's all put in a way that even on 107, it's still compatible with Husserl.

695
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:16,880
We'll talk about that more.

696
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:27,760
In fact, I think probably the whole chapter is what he is saying, a kind of Husserl line and laying down his line.

697
01:02:29,759 --> 01:02:31,279
And we will talk about that.

698
01:02:31,279 --> 01:02:38,079
It's a very, because there's always a sense in which he will go so far with Husserl and then he has to branch off.

699
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:41,440
Let me remind you what that is, so you won't forget.

700
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:50,400
Bear in mind, always, the difference between the transcendental field and the phenomenal field that he makes a fuss about.

701
01:02:50,400 --> 01:03:05,359
If you find yourself asking what is our consciousness of this, and how does our consciousness of this constitute our experience of this, you are in the transcendental field business of the wrong sort.

702
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:11,560
You're asking, you're bringing it all back to the consciousness of a constituting transcendental subject.

703
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:22,360
Now, the phenomenal field is transcendental too, but if transcendental just means that it's the condition of the possibility of encountering anything.

704
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:29,480
But the transcendental field, when Husserl hears it, it's a got to do with subjectivity and consciousness.

705
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,399
But when Heidegger hears it, we're back to that again.

706
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,840
It's being in the world.

707
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:41,320
It's the phenomenal field understood as where the buck stops, that that's the order of things.

708
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,480
That doesn't get constituted.

709
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:49,319
Constitution is finally, I think, Husserl's word, not Merlot-Ponte's.

710
01:03:49,799 --> 01:04:09,800
I think you've got to give up constitution as an activity of a conscious transcendental subject if you really get the Heidegger picture that the ultimate thing is being in the world, which is neither subject nor object, which is always already organized.

711
01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:14,199
One way to ask yourself, no, enough of that.

712
01:04:14,759 --> 01:04:16,360
Going back to this.

713
01:04:16,599 --> 01:04:21,639
We have to have lots of talk, so I don't understand why you think this has much to do with Husserl.

714
01:04:21,639 --> 01:04:26,039
But I may just be repressing the Husserl in it.

715
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:26,919
Let's see.

716
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:27,639
So here we are.

717
01:04:27,639 --> 01:04:29,160
We're looking now.

718
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:33,400
We're going on to the body as object and mechanistic psychology.

719
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:37,719
And we are, or are we, is that where the phantom wind is?

720
01:04:37,719 --> 01:04:38,440
Are we in the phantom?

721
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:39,159
Yeah, okay.

722
01:04:39,159 --> 01:04:40,920
We're still in the phantom wind, in other words.

723
01:04:41,239 --> 01:04:42,360
89.

724
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:45,239
I want to say what I, what that's the common term.

725
01:04:45,239 --> 01:04:49,000
I'm catching up with where I was, maximum grip where I was.

726
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:49,960
Okay.

727
01:04:50,279 --> 01:04:54,079
And all of this is pretty much I've explained it all now.

728
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,839
There's this current of activity that blows down the nerve.

729
01:04:53,719 --> 01:04:59,680
We've talked about that.

730
01:04:54,840 --> 01:05:05,599
There's this top-down story on 91.

731
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:12,800
It's the global presence of the situation which gives meaning to the partial stimuli and causes them to acquire importance.

732
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:13,599
Notice that.

733
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:16,079
I mean, that's sort of coming from the world.

734
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:25,440
The global presence of the situation, not consciousness, not my anticipations, even, not even our expectations.

735
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:32,560
The global situation gives meaning to the partial stimuli and causes them to acquire the importance, value, and existence for the organism.

736
01:05:33,279 --> 01:05:34,399
That's right.

737
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:45,760
And it's right only in the sense that it's half right, that usually he forgets this and gives all the power of constituting or organizing experience to the body.

738
01:05:45,759 --> 01:05:51,199
But you could equally well say that it's the situation that organizes it all.

739
01:05:51,199 --> 01:05:54,880
It's not going to make that distinction.

740
01:05:54,880 --> 01:06:12,079
The biggest being in the world story is not going to be analyzable in terms of what the body does or in terms of what the situation does, because it's what makes it possible for them both to do it in collaboration together.

741
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:22,000
And remember, just keep saying to yourself, the cup looks reachable and therefore I'm said to reach it, and it looks reachable because I'm said to reach it, and I'm said to reach it because it looks reachable.

742
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:28,799
If you keep saying that sort of mantra to yourself, you will avoid falling into visceral and be a good Heideggerian.

743
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,959
So now let's see.

744
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,959
So we get to this thing called being in the world.

745
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:42,679
I wonder if I shouldn't look more at the situation, because it sounds like the best statement.

746
01:06:42,839 --> 01:06:51,719
The reflex does not arise from a depth that didn't arise, but move back toward them, invest them with the meaning which they do not possess, only when taken as a situation.

747
01:06:51,719 --> 01:06:54,520
It causes them to exist as a situation.

748
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:59,239
Well, I don't know, that's the too much reflex stuff, did it, that we had to talk about.

749
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:03,159
It's got to do with the intention of our whole being, he says that.

750
01:07:03,959 --> 01:07:05,799
And then we're back to being in the world.

751
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:12,919
Although, one of the things that maybe priorities for the reflex and moment is inside.

752
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:13,799
Yes, I know he does.

753
01:07:13,879 --> 01:07:14,200
It does.

754
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,480
He goes back and forth.

755
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:21,400
On that one, he's not clear until he gets to the next book, which is unfortunately totally not clear.

756
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:30,119
And that's the visible and the invisible, the unpublished manuscript he was working on and he died, which if you think this is a mess, you should see that one.

757
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,520
But yeah, because it's working notes.

758
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:37,400
The part that isn't working notes is pretty clear, but it doesn't get beyond the phenomenology of perception.

759
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:46,360
And when he does, he's clear that there is equal priority, so to speak, for the body and for the world, and he calls the whole thing the flesh.

760
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:49,560
That's his new name for the overarching being in the world.

761
01:07:49,560 --> 01:08:08,679
But he stresses, I think, I mean, I think the only thing wrong with the phenomenology of perception, from his point of view, if I understand it, is this tendency to make the body the organizing principle.

762
01:08:08,679 --> 01:08:16,679
And I think that in the visible and the invisible, he's clear that the body doesn't organize the world any more than the world organizes the body.

763
01:08:16,679 --> 01:08:19,079
So we'll just call the whole thing the flesh.

764
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,039
That's how I read it.

765
01:08:20,039 --> 01:08:20,839
Is that how you read it?

766
01:08:20,919 --> 01:08:22,360
You're looking worried.

767
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:28,799
I think you don't think that the body is the center, organizing center of the world in modern perception.

768
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,119
I agree.

769
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:34,879
Because you can see that you can figure out the proper correlation between the body and the consciousness.

770
01:08:34,879 --> 01:08:39,999
And as soon as he thinks he leaves the consciousness point of view, that is in the world and the body are correlated.

771
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:41,440
Okay, we do agree.

772
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:41,919
Good.

773
01:08:41,919 --> 01:08:43,359
That would be bad if we didn't.

774
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:44,719
Let's go on then.

775
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:45,280
Let's see now.

776
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:45,679
Where am I?

777
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:47,679
I'm just looking at all the things that say.

778
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:52,879
Okay.

779
01:08:53,759 --> 01:09:12,959
I'm puzzled by how this view of the sort of equality of the body world creates in this equation you're getting some actual griffin and simple well so much to be about continuum.

780
01:09:12,959 --> 01:09:15,839
I see well, I go through them separately.

781
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:19,759
The intentional arc, it seems to me, is a is goes in both ways.

782
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:30,079
I mean, it it says that my experience shows up for me in terms of the attractiveness or the repulsiveness of the things in the world, and the things in the world solicit my actions in terms of that.

783
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,799
That's just totally reciprocal.

784
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:42,719
You could say if you even there's no s we don't need the notion that the intentional arc is somehow only in the body.

785
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:53,119
It's everything that happens to you and what meaning things have isn't stored anywhere in you, not certainly not in mental representations.

786
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:56,239
And but not even in your body schema.

787
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:58,320
It's stored in the way the world shows up.

788
01:09:58,639 --> 01:10:05,440
Now that only happens because it's correlative with your body set and so forth.

789
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:10,560
But it's not supposed to be one way, I think, for the essential art.

790
01:10:10,759 --> 01:10:25,159
Now, the maximal grip story is more where it looks too much to me, like, although I say it a lot, it can look too much like it's all back to your body getting a grip on things.

791
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:37,159
And all you have to say there is that he should have equally well talked about how the world maneuvers you around so that you get to appreciate it in its maximal grippy.

792
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:37,799
That's right.

793
01:10:37,799 --> 01:10:39,639
There are all these norms that are out there.

794
01:10:39,959 --> 01:10:40,520
That's right.

795
01:10:40,679 --> 01:10:49,719
And you are being pulled, so the world's helping you get a grip on it and drawing you to the best place to get a grip on it.

796
01:10:49,719 --> 01:10:53,639
It's again, I mean, that's how I think one ought to think about it.

797
01:10:53,639 --> 01:10:59,400
And you should be keeping your eyes open for at least two things that Alva and I are disagreeing about.

798
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:09,560
One is, and this one is going to look definitely like a lot of the time he is indeed giving priority to the body.

799
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:13,480
And you can just try to keep your eyes open to where he is and where he isn't.

800
01:11:13,719 --> 01:11:15,240
I'm not saying he isn't.

801
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:16,919
I'm saying he shouldn't be.

802
01:11:16,919 --> 01:11:24,039
Now, the other thing you can look for, because Alva thinks that I'm leading maximum grip into it, and that's very important.

803
01:11:24,039 --> 01:11:32,759
Never mind whether it's the body trying to get the maximum grip on the world or the world trying to get maximally gripped by the body.

804
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:36,199
That issue put aside.

805
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,759
Is it maximum grip that it's all about?

806
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:41,879
Or is there something else that's behind it all?

807
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:51,879
If there is, what is this current of existence going down the nerve, if not the tendency of the whole thing to reach optimal equilibrium in his talk?

808
01:11:51,879 --> 01:11:52,919
Well, yeah, go ahead, Brick.

809
01:11:52,999 --> 01:11:54,200
Well, I kind of agree with both of you.

810
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:56,160
I think you are overemphasizing the maximum grip.

811
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:57,999
There is something else there.

812
01:11:58,639 --> 01:11:59,839
Well, what is it?

813
01:11:55,560 --> 01:12:02,639
That's what I've written, my maximum grip in the margin.

814
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:03,599
Tell me about it.

815
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:10,320
Brian in all the paper in terms of the refusal of the efficiency?

816
01:12:19,759 --> 01:12:22,560
The natural momentum with the rows that include the majority of the markets.

817
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:30,879
Okay, but isn't the natural momentum the constantly trying to get a maximum grip?

818
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:34,320
I think it's it's the tendency the void is away.

819
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,239
Yeah, I'm not sure.

820
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,480
Well, I hear it the other way.

821
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:42,959
I hear that having tasks are all sub-forms of trying to get a maximum grip.

822
01:12:42,959 --> 01:12:46,079
Sometimes it's eating, sometimes it's moving around to get a better view.

823
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:52,320
Maybe we're talking about getting a getting a maximum grip would be something like my relationship.

824
01:12:55,599 --> 01:12:56,639
Ah, well, that's good.

825
01:12:56,639 --> 01:12:57,919
That's a good distinction.

826
01:12:57,919 --> 01:12:59,759
Now, I think maybe you're right.

827
01:12:59,759 --> 01:13:00,480
I don't know.

828
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:03,119
You'd have to look at the few times he mentions it.

829
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:06,719
But there probably is a local kind of maximum grip.

830
01:13:06,959 --> 01:13:08,240
It certainly is, certainly is.

831
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:09,919
You want to get the best grip on the mug.

832
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:20,879
In his example, you want to get the best pic you want to stand in a museum so that you can see the most detail and the most overall form of a picture because that's a maximal.

833
01:13:20,879 --> 01:13:22,160
You want to cut optimal.

834
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:25,200
Optimal and maximum.

835
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:26,639
You make a distinction?

836
01:13:26,959 --> 01:13:29,359
I think there's numbers, but I'm not here.

837
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,159
I don't know.

838
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:34,159
But anyway, let me say something more about this a second.

839
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:43,239
Yeah, I want to say that he says something like, you want to get, I think it's maximal, and so we'll stick to that.

840
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:58,440
Maximal richness and where your expectations will be maximally met, and that you're all, that's his picture of a kind of equilibrium you're always tending toward and never managing to fully achieve.

841
01:13:58,839 --> 01:14:01,879
Is that the maximal grip of the whole picture?

842
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:05,560
Because it's fit to be good.

843
01:14:05,959 --> 01:14:21,079
I realize it's a different context where the statement occurs where it talks about the maximal richness and that your actions will be maximally responded to by the world.

844
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:21,959
We have to look.

845
01:14:21,959 --> 01:14:24,280
My hunch is, keep your eyes open for this.

846
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:25,959
These are important distinctions.

847
01:14:25,959 --> 01:14:41,079
Whether maximal grips talk ever is in there, and if it is, whether it's for local jobs like getting the right distance from pictures, or whether there's some general thing like what Heidegger and Wittgenstein call finding your way around in the world.

848
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:51,639
That is, always being, always trying to get a grip on things such that you're not surprised by anything and you're able to do whatever you want to do.

849
01:14:51,639 --> 01:14:55,239
That higher story, I don't know whether that's in there.

850
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,119
I think it is.

851
01:14:56,120 --> 01:15:07,160
So just to raise that question, what comes, what is higher the engagement, or the tendency, which I guess you would say free, we are.

852
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:08,119
Perfect.

853
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:08,759
Perfect.

854
01:15:08,759 --> 01:15:18,520
And of course, and notice that the structure of what you said is sort of, on my side, only in the sense that he's always going to the bigger, bigger holes, which make the possibility.

855
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:19,639
I don't agree with the bigger hole.

856
01:15:19,879 --> 01:15:23,480
Yeah, but I mean, but it looks like the candidate for the bigger hole can't be the individual.

857
01:15:23,879 --> 01:15:28,239
The individual task is going to be a bigger hole than this particular action.

858
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:33,200
I think it's the tendency towards the future to have more tasks.

859
01:15:33,839 --> 01:15:35,599
Well, the tendency towards tasks.

860
01:15:35,599 --> 01:15:37,440
Okay, well, that's getting close.

861
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:43,440
Because if you want to know, sort of, that's almost there to a global optimal grip.

862
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:46,879
Because the tendency toward tasks, why are there tasks?

863
01:15:46,879 --> 01:15:56,879
Well, because there's constantly things that aren't working out like you would expect, or you can't see them very well yet, or you want them, but you can't reach them.

864
01:15:56,879 --> 01:15:57,360
I think.

865
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,199
You see the picture I had of it.

866
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:02,400
And I just, this sentence is in front of me, and then somebody else can talk.

867
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:08,560
He talks about you've got the natural momentum which throws us into the tasks.

868
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:12,400
I think that that's a derivative function?

869
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,639
Yes, but what I'm going to try to find.

870
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:18,560
Well, this is so general, I don't know.

871
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:21,839
A certain energy in the pulsation of existence.

872
01:16:21,839 --> 01:16:23,360
It phrases like that.

873
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:25,520
That's on 92.

874
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:26,959
What are you going to make of that?

875
01:16:26,959 --> 01:16:31,839
I mean, I'm trying to say that the energy, that's like the nerve again.

876
01:16:31,839 --> 01:16:44,480
The energy in the pulsation of existence is that the organism is, and now we can say it maybe in both our ways, sort of moving to constantly take on new tasks and succeed at them.

877
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,240
I would say by tendency, like it's not a terrible term.

878
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,039
Okay, a tendency.

879
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:50,240
It's being a tendency towards.

880
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:58,480
Which is correlative to its being constantly pulled into new tasks because they're always correlative.

881
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:02,879
Okay, oh, well, it's now time to tell you where we are and what's going to happen next.

882
01:17:02,879 --> 01:17:06,560
I pretty well finished the Phantom Limb story.

883
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,159
I may not even go back to it.

884
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:24,440

885
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:29,799
Tomorrow if you came with tomorrow and the course right, we'll have them revive it.

886
01:17:29,959 --> 01:17:30,520
That's right.

887
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:31,799
That's absolutely right.
