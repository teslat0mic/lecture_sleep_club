1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,120
But the next assignment to make up for this one being very short, is I'm afraid going to be very long, if you could see on this.

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,759
The first one was to read it from 3 to 14.

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:11,839
How many managed to do that?

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,120
Oh, good.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,360
How many thought they understood it?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Well, if you did, that's probably a bad sign.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,559
But because it's so incomprehensible.

8
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:24,320
He is such a terrible writer.

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,039
He reads certain things that closes that you know stuff where you that you don't.

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,280
And worse, I'm going to explain in a minute.

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:39,439
He tries to sort of tricks you into believing that you're reading his view when you're really reading his version of the view he's going to review.

12
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,200
Let me say a word about that right away.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,799
That doesn't happen in the part you read, but it starts happening like mad in the next part.

14
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:47,999
And I'm going to spend some time.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:05,120
It may seem crazy, and I've never done it before, but I'm going to tell you where he's not talking about his view, but the opposite, because he doesn't give you any clue, and it can happen in the middle of a paragraph, and in fact, two pages later, in the middle of a paragraph, he's back giving you his view.

16
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,359
Once you understand the book, you can sort of learn to play that game.

17
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,640
But for the first time through, it's just devastating.

18
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,880
And so I'm going to just tell you the places.

19
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,719
I'm going to write it on the board right now.

20
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:29,039
The places where, well, open your book, and we're going to look at, what, I didn't bring it after all this advertising.

21
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:30,160
That's amazing.

22
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,439
I can't believe it.

23
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,239
Oh.

24
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,159
I'll warn you if I haven't got it.

25
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,319
Well, I can't, because I marked it in here.

26
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:37,200
So don't worry.

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,640
We'll just go through and find it.

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay, here we are.

29
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,879
Starting right out on page 15.

30
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,599
He starts out giving you somebody else's view.

31
00:01:49,920 --> 00:02:00,119
And then on page 17, it says the fact that a shape is, well, you'd think if he says the fact that, that must be his view.

32
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,920
And it would be.

33
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,079
The French, the translation is wrong.

34
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:05,799
I mean, the word could have been translated the fact that.

35
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:06,920
I think it's probably at all.

36
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,879
But the right thing to put there is but.

37
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,479
But the but is still part of the other view.

38
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:22,680
It doesn't become his view until page 18, where it says now, the sensation and image.

39
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:25,319
Then he's telling you what he thinks.

40
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:31,719
It's just his way of doing things to, and it's interesting, and once you understand, it's sort of brilliant.

41
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:40,359
But to try to get you to see the other view as convincingly as possible before he tells you what's wrong with it.

42
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:53,240
It's not unlike Wittgenstein, but on a smaller scale, giving you this interlocutor that comes in in the investigations and tells you just the sensible things that you already believe, only you'll discover that this is not what you should be thinking.

43
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,440
Okay, so that's one of them.

44
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:58,760
I'm just going to go through and find them here because I didn't bring the page in which I wrote them down.

45
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,039
Okay, so much for that.

46
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:10,439
In the next chapter, attention and judgment, in the second paragraph, he starts with this maybe shown.

47
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:18,519
That's not his view, and it's not his view for about 15 lines until it says attention.

48
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:22,919
And then it goes over his view, but not for long.

49
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:30,520
On page 31, at the bottom, when he says it's true, that turns out to be a bad sign.

50
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,199
That probably means he doesn't think it's true.

51
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,680
And it may be that that's but, but I'm not sure.

52
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,879
I can go back to the French.

53
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:51,280
It starts to be the view he opposes three lines from the bottom of 31, and goes on being the view that he opposes until four lines from the bottom of 32, where it says object question mark.

54
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,239
Those are the main ones.

55
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,919
I don't remember whether there's any more.

56
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,399
No, here's another one, a long one, again.

57
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,879
Okay, on page 43, just always in the middle of a paragraph.

58
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,239
Not that there are very many paragraphs.

59
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:16,800
Anyway, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleventh line down on 43 to the world or opinion.

60
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,879
Well, that's a good clue there.

61
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,760
I mean, the world and opinion are usually bad guys.

62
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,279
I mean, we know better.

63
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,959
I mean, that's, Wittgenstein said something like that.

64
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,319
But it goes on being the view of the world or opinion.

65
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:35,519
One, two, three, thirteen lines down on 44, where it gets to reflecting.

66
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,759
Then it goes back to being his view.

67
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,280
I'm going to give you one more help on the I see where, no, this is a different point.

68
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,759
I'll tell you this one too.

69
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,680
This is a long assignment.

70
00:04:47,680 --> 00:05:01,839
What I just said was a kind of bracket, and what I also want to say is because we only read from 3 to 14, which is a very short, to catch up with where I want to be and cover all we have to do.

71
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:07,759
I'm afraid next time you're going to have a big chunk to read, from 15 to 59.

72
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,399
And now you've been warned how long it took you to read that.

73
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,639
Now it's going to take you a long time to read this.

74
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,479
So please start trying.

75
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:28,480
It's pretty important that you read it before I talk about it, because you have to get some sense of what's going on so that you can either agree with me or disagree with me or understand why I'm helping you with this or that.

76
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:34,920
And then, of course you're going to have to read it again after I've talked about it and you're going to have to read it again before you write a paper on it.

77
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,240
And that's that's just what happens with a hard book like this.

78
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:54,680
But all I can do to help this big giving you this other chunk of reading, which finishes his destruction of what he calls the traditional prejudices and gives you the return to the phenomena, is you can skip the part on Descartes.

79
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:05,080
Because even if you've had 25B and even if you have read a lot of Descartes, you wouldn't recognize the complicated details about Descartes that he's going into.

80
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:10,759
Being French, he's got to sort of settle his score with Descartes and set up his relation to Descartes.

81
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,759
And you can assume that everybody's read Descartes since they were literally in high school.

82
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,360
And but we can't assume that and we don't care.

83
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:26,920
And so you can you better skip from 48 to 52 plus the huge footnote on page 40.

84
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,680
Oh no, footnote 40.

85
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,359
Footnote number 40.

86
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:38,040
I mean you can go back and read that someday, but in order to get all that read, anything you can skip is the better.

87
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,319
Now that's all just laying out things.

88
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:48,840
Do you have any questions about that or about how we're gonna proceed or any practical problems?

89
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,800
If not, I'm just going to start trying to explain it.

90
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,280
Yeah.

91
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,639
Well, I just want to know, um, you think we who how many people do you think we will have?

92
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:03,400
Ah, well, I are are there people here who weren't here last time?

93
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,960
Let's start with that, who think that we want to be in the course.

94
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,160
That would be upsetting.

95
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:07,880
Uh-oh.

96
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:08,839
Put up your hands high.

97
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,399
Don't hide.

98
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,920
I've got to cope with it.

99
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,680
One, two, three, four.

100
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,639
I don't know about how of that.

101
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:27,680
But the way it looks now, we have 72 people who are in the course, on the waiting list, and filled in forms to being in discussion sections, even if they weren't.

102
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,759
And that's all we can take.

103
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:36,879
But I can pretty well assume that there's going to be some attrition that we're going to lose some of those 72.

104
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:42,960
And therefore, if you were here last time and wanted to be in it, you're in it, isn't that right?

105
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:43,360
Yeah.

106
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:43,920
Yeah.

107
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:53,920
But if you weren't here last time and wanted to be in it, and you hang around, you four or five people, I could pretty well assume that you will.

108
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,680
I can't imagine that four or five people won't give up on this stuff.

109
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,639
So, but that's the situation.

110
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,839
The graduate students, by the way, I should say, aren't assigned to discussion sections.

111
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,560
They can go to any discussion section they please.

112
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,319
It's definitely a positive thing, and you should take advantage of it if you possibly can.

113
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:24,240
But the way graduate students are treated is generally they don't have to go to discussion sections, and I will grade their papers, not anybody in the discussion sections.

114
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,360
Whether I meet with the graduate students or not, I'm not sure yet.

115
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,519
I have to think more about that.

116
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,280
But there was one more thing.

117
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,240
Oh, yeah, about discussion sections for undergraduates.

118
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,080
They are required.

119
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,400
By that, I just mean that basically you'd be crazy not to go.

120
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,920
We've got two super TAs, and this is super hard stuff.

121
00:08:45,919 --> 00:09:03,240
But I also mean that if you're on a borderline, the students say A minus and B plus, and your TA is making out, figuring out your grade, naturally, if you came to discussion sections and contributed, coming there just and taking up space is not, you don't get any credit for that.

122
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:11,160
But if you come to discussion sections and discuss, then of course then you'll be bumped up to the A minus side.

123
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:16,440
And if you haven't, if the TA doesn't even know who you are, that's a very bad sign after 15 weeks.

124
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,760
You'll probably bump down to the lower.

125
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:23,799
So that's the way the requiredness of it actually has teeth in it.

126
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:28,040
But the important thing is you'd be crazy not to come to your discussion sections.

127
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:33,879
And we say it up so that everybody can come to discussion, come to a discussion section.

128
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:36,200
Now, anything, I mean, that had to be said at some point.

129
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,480
Any questions about that?

130
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,600
So if you weren't here last time and you wanted to involve in the course, send me an email.

131
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,280
Okay, yeah, send Rick an email so we have you on some kind of list.

132
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,680
I took this, didn't I, and sent it back to you.

133
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,320
Okay.

134
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,559
Anything else?

135
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:55,720
I mean, it's sort of almost too good to be true that everything is clear this year.

136
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,799
Have you all found copies of this?

137
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:01,320
When you, I mean, is there anybody looking for the book who hasn't been able to find it?

138
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:02,600
That would be very upsetting.

139
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,079
Last time I talked, of course, half the class didn't have the book because it was not ordered.

140
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:08,200
Okay, you've all got it.

141
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,360
Yeah.

142
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,520
Some of the recommended texts are called.

143
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,040
Okay, that's interesting.

144
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,399
Tell me, do you remember which?

145
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:14,519
I think all of them.

146
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,000
All of them.

147
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,040
Oh, yeah, I noticed that.

148
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:18,200
I went to the bookstore to check up on it.

149
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,919
So I guess we should order more recommended texts.

150
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,600
Let's talk about that for a minute.

151
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:39,200
I mean, it's let me say something about the recommended text because I really don't know sort of in what sense they're recommended, since your hands are going to be full reading the phenomenology of perception, and you're you probably haven't got any more time.

152
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,679
And if you read it carefully and listen to me and go to your discussion sections, you should be able to understand it it.

153
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:49,920
Just because they are so relevant, I put down three recommended.

154
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:59,280
The structure of behavior is the book Merleau-Ponty wrote before and in conjunction with the phenomenology of perception.

155
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,360
It's his minor thesis.

156
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:04,720
To get a PhD in those days, you had to write two theses.

157
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:24,960
And so the structure of behavior takes up a lot of the sort of empirical data and goes through the stages from the minimal organisms up to human beings and tries to show how at each stage they have a different structure of their relation to the environment.

158
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,400
It's interesting.

159
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:36,480
Sometimes it says things that are very relevant, but unless you're sort of particularly interested in that, you probably won't have time to read it.

160
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:46,879
I'll cite it a bit when it comes to his discussion of the relation of empirical science to phenomenology, because he's got to talk about that in that book.

161
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,000
And he does.

162
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:54,560
Okay, so sense and nonsense, again, it's sort of ambiguous whether you should get it or not.

163
00:11:54,559 --> 00:12:01,360
On the one hand, it's got in it this article which I think you should all read for sure, which is Cézanne's doubt.

164
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,720
I mentioned it last time.

165
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:18,800
It's just a brilliant sort of encapsulation of what he thinks is what happens in perception that you don't normally see, but a great painter sees and puts it down on the canvas where you can see it if you've got Merleau-Ponty as a guide.

166
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,920
Well, I put sense and nonsense on reserve in the Housing Philosophy Library.

167
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:24,800
I should mention that.

168
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:29,199
That's the library on the second floor of Moses next to my office.

169
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,280
I'm 303.

170
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:30,680
I don't know.

171
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,639
The library doesn't have a number.

172
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:39,240
Anyway, even if it does, if you stand in front of my office, 303 Moses, the library is next to you on your right.

173
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:45,240
And I put all three of these books on reserve and the phenomenology of perception.

174
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:52,519
And so there's not much else in Sense and Nonsense besides the Deisenstadt, which is really helpful.

175
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:57,639
There is one for those interested in film called The Film and the New Psychology.

176
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:58,600
And that's helpful.

177
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,800
It shows how thinking about developed psychology can help you understand the film.

178
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,040
Those are about the only two that you really need.

179
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:19,560
But it's a very interesting book because it's Merylo-Ponchi trying to write for an intelligent general audience instead of just who knows who's supposed to read this thesis.

180
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:28,680
But it's articles he wrote for the Tomodan, which he and Sartre founded in about one three, I think.

181
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:37,799
And these articles are all written brilliantly well and totally differently than the phenomenology of perception or the structure of behavior.

182
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,960
Maybe he had some editor who went over there.

183
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,559
Maybe Sartre fixed them.

184
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:42,440
I don't know.

185
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:46,759
So everything else being equal, it's nice to buy Sense and Nonsense.

186
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:51,160
But it's not just Xerox, the two articles that are in there that are important.

187
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:55,639
So it's Dezan's Daut, and for some of you, the film one.

188
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:58,200
Now, the third one is different again.

189
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:02,200
Sam Totis was a fellow graduate student of mine.

190
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,159
He is absolutely brilliant.

191
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:07,399
He is the stage after Merlot Ponte.

192
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:13,799
I talked about this last time, but I don't think I don't remember whether I mentioned his name, but I mentioned his, I did, okay.

193
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:13,840
Okay.

194
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:21,040
Yeah, he brings in the actual structure of the body, which is just a step, the next step after Marilla-Ponty.

195
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:31,120
He does it in a book where it's surrounded by discussion of Kant and how you would have to rewrite Kant to take account of perception.

196
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:38,080
And it's sort of what Kant would be if Kant had read Marilla-Ponty.

197
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,200
And that's interesting.

198
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:48,560
When I put it over here, I put that the pages you really want to read, it's on the back of the syllabus for week seven, would be TOTUS 102 to 129.

199
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:53,360
That's where he just does the phenomenology and doesn't mention Kant at all.

200
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,360
And again, you could just Xerox that.

201
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,040
I put it on reserve.

202
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:22,080
Or, in particular, if you're interested in how to relate this to Kant, you will find it fascinating because it amounts to saying, well, look, Kant had a story about conception and a conceptual, the level of our experience of the world, which is propositional and conceptual, but he didn't have an account of the preconceptual, perceptual way we're in the world.

203
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,440
What would the critique of pure reason look like if he had?

204
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,200
And that's what is up to you in the rest of the book.

205
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,280
Okay, now I told you about that.

206
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:33,520
Now I'm curious, got this far.

207
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,480
How many would like to buy, now I can find out what to tell the bookstore.

208
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,440
How many sitting people here want the structure of behavior and haven't got it?

209
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,719
Okay, two, three, four, five.

210
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,120
Okay.

211
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,800
And how many would like sense and nonsense and haven't got it?

212
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:51,919
But let me write this down.

213
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,520
I'll just tell them what to buy.

214
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,800
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

215
00:15:58,799 --> 00:15:59,279
Okay.

216
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,159
How many would like San Totis's Body and World and haven't got it?

217
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,600
One, two, three, four.

218
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,079
Did I have five, six, seven?

219
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:14,039
I think I maybe did I miss people last time because I see let's try just once more.

220
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,120
Structure behavior, put your hands up high.

221
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:18,280
This is such a I'm surrounded so much.

222
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:25,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, five, eight.

223
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,439
Fuck a big difference.

224
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,840
And how about sense and nonsense?

225
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,680
Let's try that in front of it.

226
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:36,600
One, two, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.

227
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,080
Okay, big difference there too.

228
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,519
Okay, I'll try to get the bookstore to order a dozen of each of these.

229
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:44,440
See what happens.

230
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:48,440
Now, maybe everything is clear?

231
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:48,920
Yeah.

232
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,360
Is the website up?

233
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:53,319
Ah, the website is up in a certain way.

234
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:54,440
We should talk about that.

235
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,480
It's got the syllabus on it and these readings.

236
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:00,520
It's got all that what you've got in your hands.

237
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:18,439
Plus, and it's hard to keep up the website, but I have got on it so far week one, the Charles Taylor paper and the I haven't got my Primacy of Perception paper and my Introduction to Sense and Nonsense yet.

238
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:23,799
Oh, well, my introduction to Sense and Nonsense is not going to be on a website because it's published.

239
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,000
It's there.

240
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,039
It's maybe another reason for buying Sense and Nonsense.

241
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:32,440
But it's a very general introduction, which I wrote 40 years ago.

242
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,640
It covers up well how little I understood, I think, in rereading it.

243
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,879
But I don't think it's all illuminated.

244
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:45,279
So, and but the second week is already there, Taylor Carmen's Sensation Judgment in the Phenomenal Field.

245
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:51,759
That's a very good exposition of this first four chapters that we're reading.

246
00:17:52,400 --> 00:18:01,359
The section that is called, I read it, I meant I said it once, but I'll say it again, but you don't see it except here on this page called Introduction.

247
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:12,879
Oh, the whole thing on traditional prejudices and the return to the phenomena, which has got the sensation, association, and pension, and finally the heart on the phenomenal field.

248
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:15,279
That's what we're going to do all next week.

249
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:17,359
That's a sizable chunk of the book.

250
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:20,319
And we all have to re-read it.

251
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,519
After we read it, you have to read it hard.

252
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:36,720
Now, so that's what's not going to be on the website because of the general agreement between me and the PAs that it's not good to sort of seduce you into any easy way out.

253
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm not going to put these lectures on the website the way I sometimes put lectures for courses on the website.

254
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,200
You really got to come and take part and pay attention and take notes.

255
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,880
And I've got it all on recorded.

256
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:58,799
And then after the course, I'll make it, I'll put it on the website and make a CV out that you can copy.

257
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,439
But you're not supposed to be leaning on that for this.

258
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,040
I think it's a trade-off.

259
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:14,159
I mean, some people will get a lot out of going back and listening to the lectures, and it wouldn't keep them termed, and it wouldn't keep them sort of not taking notes.

260
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:20,079
But some people, too many people, will use it as a clutch.

261
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:22,559
So, anyway, that's the story about the website.

262
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:29,640
You'll find on it as quickly as possible all the stuff that's on the back of the syllabus that is outside reading.

263
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,480
That outside reading, I wouldn't put it on here if it weren't really useful.

264
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:40,679
That is, it's supposed to actually give you some help in reading all this hard stuff.

265
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,519
And if you get time, it pays to read it.

266
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:49,480
However, if you haven't got time, just keep reading the phenomenology over and over.

267
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,839
Anything else?

268
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,759
Those people out there, I feel bad about that.

269
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,039
There's no way to get them in?

270
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:54,759
Yeah.

271
00:19:54,759 --> 00:20:04,679
Is there material from the three later prerequisites that you would recommend that you list on the website to look at to sort of help us along as we go, or would that be?

272
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:06,279
You mean on the prerequisite?

273
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:07,159
Well, I did that already.

274
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,519
I decided to thank you.

275
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:11,480
I've put what part of CODIS you should be looking at.

276
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:18,039
I put what part of sense and nonsense, namely the doubt, says Anne's Doubt.

277
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,279
And I don't know what to tell you about what's in destructive behavior.

278
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:25,319
That's a challenge, but I haven't, and I can.

279
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,559
It's sort of all over the place.

280
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,320
It sort of touches up here and there.

281
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:32,599
There's no sort of chapter the way there is in the other two.

282
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:37,639
What I'm actually referring to is Searle, Kahn, and Heidegger that you have listed on the prerequisites.

283
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,519
Ah, oh, I misunderstood you completely.

284
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:42,279
What's the question?

285
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:51,159
I mean, if there's places, it would be helpful, it seems like, to if there's places that we can look at for sort of uses supplementary readings as we go along today.

286
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,720
I see.

287
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,759
Yes, I can tell you.

288
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:53,799
I can tell you.

289
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:54,759
At least I can begin.

290
00:20:54,759 --> 00:21:05,079
Searle's book, Intentionality, where he does perception and action, and thereby is in a head-on collision with Merlot Phone T.

291
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:13,879
And that's what I write about a lot in this paper, The Primacy of Phenomenology, which I'm going to get on the website.

292
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:24,000
And Kant, I have no idea what would be Kant is just so hard.

293
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,680
I can't think of any, is there anything that we could tell people to read in Kant?

294
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:29,440
The Critique of Pure Reason.

295
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,319
Take off the mirror, the Critique of Pure Reason.

296
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:34,400
It's the only advice I got for that one.

297
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,200
And what else?

298
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,720
And the history of modern?

299
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,119
Well, we could talk about that a minute.

300
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,559
Somebody came in and told me they were reading Berkman Russell on the history of modern.

301
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,920
That's not a good idea.

302
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,799
At least he doesn't understand it very well by general opinion, though he writes very well.

303
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:57,279
Does anybody know of a good book on the history of modern that would help people who want to?

304
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:58,960
Roger Scruton, what's it called?

305
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,319
History of modern philosophy.

306
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,000
History of modern philosophy.

307
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,879
Okay.

308
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,159
So that's now that's that's those sort of prerequisites, aren't they?

309
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,639
25.

310
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,960
I just did 25B, Roger Scruton.

311
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,879
I've done 132, Earl.

312
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,079
I give up on Kant.

313
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:21,759
I don't think there's any way to talk about anything I should read that would get them what they would have had if they went through a perception course.

314
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:25,439
That seems a bit hard to say.

315
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,400
Okay.

316
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:32,480
And being in time, well, that's a whole world in itself.

317
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:43,600
I mean, if you had to read something for being in time, I guess you should read my commentary on being in time, in which I try to put being in time in just the right relation to Merlot-Ponty, you might say.

318
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:54,480
That is, as the first attempt to get rid of this distinction between subject and object and explain us as being in the world, that he's that that's a big influence on Merlot-Ponty.

319
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,039
And so okay, that was a good question.

320
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,039
That's that's the best I can do for an answer.

321
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:05,960
Now, I think we're ready to go into the complications of the text.

322
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:11,079
Okay, first, let's talk about the structure of the argument overall.

323
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:14,359
What's going on in these first four chapters?

324
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:27,240
Well, he says philosophers have traditionally tried to understand perception as the reconstruction of the objective world based on sensations caused by input to the sense organs.

325
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:33,400
And that's the view that he wants to attack.

326
00:23:34,839 --> 00:24:07,080
The idea that there is something a sensation, which is between some intermediary between the object as described by science, and the subjective experience, that that's how the sensation turns out to be how the impact of the universe, so to speak, on the organism gets picked up and is experienced as a sensation, which then the mind has to work on to give us, reconstruct the world of objects.

327
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,439
That's how it looks to scientists.

328
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,120
That's how it looks to neuroscientists, but he thinks that's wrong.

329
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:26,119
I'm going to say this over and over in various ways, but the sensation has this sort of meaningless atomic impression, to use Hume's terms.

330
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:34,519
There is no such thing, and even if there were, there'd be no way to get from there to experience of objects.

331
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:50,960
Now, the argument is sort of like the legal argument when somebody is accusing somebody of having broken a pot, but borrowed and broken a pot, but you can argue in the law, one, the person who's accused says, I never borrowed the pot and decides when I gave it back it wasn't broken.

332
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,799
It sort of narrow points.

333
00:24:52,799 --> 00:25:00,160
He is saying, well, there are no such things as sensations, but even if there were, they wouldn't do any job, they wouldn't do the job you expect them to do.

334
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,519
So he's sort of overkill, in a sense, in this two-part argument.

335
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:13,599
So the first chapter is the argument that there isn't any such basic unit as a sensation.

336
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:17,119
There's no ground for such an assumption.

337
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:35,359
The reason we think there is, according to him, where's the impression is supposed to be determinate, isolable, and it makes up the elements out of which somehow you construct the whole of perception.

338
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:46,560
And he thinks that it's only because people assume that our experience of objects is like the object of experience that we get this idea.

339
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:52,000
The object of experience, this, is determinate, roughly isolable.

340
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,480
I mean, you can take the electer and put it in any other context you please.

341
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,519
It'll be looking like an electer.

342
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:05,759
And it has, in the Cartesian jargon he likes to take up, parts outside of parts.

343
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:14,879
That it's, it's made up, it's an element, it's a separate thing, and then you could take it apart into lots of separate elements at lots of different stages.

344
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,799
That's how the world is.

345
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,720
The objects in the world, or the objects in the universe, both.

346
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,439
I mean, the objects in the universe are made out of electrons.

347
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,039
The objects in the world are things like the electern.

348
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,320
But in those cases, it seems that you can isolate them from their context and get the bare impression.

349
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:37,720
And he thinks that's wrong.

350
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:44,039
The whole introduction is trying to argue with the whole first chapter that there aren't any sensations.

351
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:50,119
And the rest of the introduction is supposed to tell you why if there were, they wouldn't do you any good anyway.

352
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:54,519
So I'm going to read you things.

353
00:26:54,519 --> 00:27:03,879
I'm going to read you lots because I'm just almost when I started looking at this, rereading it, I realized that I sort of wanted to cite every sentence.

354
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,679
And so let's start on page three.

355
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:15,159
He's describing this impression and how it's this pure sensation at the bottom of the read.

356
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:15,960
Yeah.

357
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,519
Oh, the first sentence.

358
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:20,279
Ah, I see.

359
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:21,000
Okay, right.

360
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,879
Well, I might as well just give the, I guess I could give both the pages.

361
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:25,319
Well, no, I'll give the first sentence.

362
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:26,039
That's fine.

363
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:29,720
This sentence, this paragraph begins, I might in the first place.

364
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:31,960
And then skipping down.

365
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,759
And then maybe I'll read something I didn't.

366
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:40,679
It's just an example of a little moment of not narrow upon heat.

367
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,480
He's describing the sensation.

368
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:51,159
And he keeps saying, I might, in the first paragraph, I might in the first place understand by sensation, but he doesn't.

369
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,440
And then he goes on a little further.

370
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:58,200
I might have said to have a sense experience is to coincide with what's sensed.

371
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:03,480
And the important thing is that this impression signifies nothing for me.

372
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,319
Yeah, he might have said those things.

373
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:09,720
That would be the right things to say about sensations, if there were any sensations.

374
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,839
But since he doesn't think they are, he wouldn't say that.

375
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:14,759
It's a funny way for him to put it.

376
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:27,439
So the bottom of page three, which is still our same paragraph, he says, pure sensation will be the experience of an undifferentiated, instantaneous, dot-like impact.

377
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:34,160
Well, that's what maybe people, that's what people who believe in sensations believe, but that's not what he believes.

378
00:28:35,759 --> 00:29:01,200
And if it were, we'd have to add something to get from there to a meaningful experience of objects, which is very complicated, but just for the minimal, we could get to intentionality where we experience something as having various aspects and having our mind, we could have our minds directed toward it.

379
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:10,240
All of that requires a whole lot if all you've got is a bare, point-like, meaningless impact to start out with.

380
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,320
But then this is this overkill.

381
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:32,240
Because the tradition is the way it is, he's got to deal with the whole history of philosophy since Descartes was devoted to showing how you could get from these meaningless, minimal, atomic impressions to an experience of a world with objects.

382
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,079
So chapter two is a critique of empiricism.

383
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:40,240
And empiricism is human, in effect.

384
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,399
And it says, well, what are you going to add to these, to an impression to make it about something?

385
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,399
Well, lots more impressions.

386
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:59,720
So if I get the impression of something that looks like a front of a house, to get the experience of a house, you've got to associate that with the experience of the back and the sides and everything.

387
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:06,440
I'm going to erase your, I made a sort of list of that.

388
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:06,680
Okay.

389
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:42,599
That he's got always, and this is why I'm going to give you this list, in mind a kind of way of, he has a way of arguing, which is always to say, well, the empiricist says such and such, and that means, I'll say it now, but I'll write on the board in a minute, that means Hume and Locke, mainly, have a way of trying to explain, analogous to the way science explains, how we get from impressions to experience of objects.

390
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:49,160
So Hume said, well, I'm going to do in my treatise what Newton did for physics, I'm going to do for the mind.

391
00:30:49,160 --> 00:31:00,039
I'm going to give you a causal account of how a meaningless impression gets associated according to some laws of association so that you get an experience of objects.

392
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:16,679
And that tradition, which I'll print this up here, there's one place where he says early on that I won't go look at it in the preface, that he's not doing explaining and he's not doing analyzing, but he's doing describing.

393
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:24,519
And explaining and analyzing, I think, are his names for these two wrong approaches, which won't work.

394
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:30,519
Empiric, and that gives you Milton Locke, and gives you causal account.

395
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:32,200
I'm not good at writing things.

396
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:34,120
Can you read that from way back there?

397
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:35,399
Probably not.

398
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:36,440
Can you?

399
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,000
Almost.

400
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,559
That's good.

401
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:38,679
I'm trying hard.

402
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:43,720
So, and they want, probably I could have put it here.

403
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,640
I'll put it up here.

404
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,160
This is where you get a meaningless impression to start with.

405
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,480
I have to put that in there somewhere.

406
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:51,279
Impression.

407
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:58,480
I put it up there because, after all, then you get a causal account of, and you get the laws.

408
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:07,759
So these guys had this idea that there were meaningless impressions, and then they had a causal account giving you the laws of association.

409
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,599
And as long as they got this whole picture on the board, I'll try to get out of the way.

410
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Then we want to go, and if this is at all of interest to us, well, there must be some contemporary version of it, people who still believe that in some way.

411
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:45,599
Well, the main people that were at Marilo-Conte's time were the behaviorists, or if it's not his time, it's where Marilo-Conte connects up with us, is that behaviorism also is trying to treat the mind like physics, find the laws of association and reinforcement by which you get from their impressions.

412
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:53,119
And that's interesting because Charles Taylor's first book, The Explanation of Behavior, nobody reads any of it.

413
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,599
It did such a good job.

414
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,759
It destroyed behaviorism.

415
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,319
It didn't get the credit for destroying behaviorism because at the very same time Chomsky destroyed behaviorism and got more publicity from it.

416
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:19,519
But in any case, what Charles Taylor did was just read Marilo-Conte, translate it all into analytics, turn it against Skinner and go if it was the project for Skinner and behaviorists or even incoherent.

417
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:35,799
And he did it without having to assume a lot of the things that Chomsky well, no, Chomsky criticized Skinner's book, Verbal Behavior, and showed that that the phenomena was such that Skinner's way of dealing with it missed it.

418
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:37,880
And I think Taylor's saying the same thing.

419
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,679
So there you've got it.

420
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,159
I'll just read it for those of you way out there who can't see it.

421
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,319
So this is the con called explaining.

422
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:45,399
The people who do it are empiricists.

423
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,559
Hume and Locke are the main ones.

424
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:50,839
They believe that we start with meaningless impressions.

425
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:55,319
Then they want to give a causal account of how we get from there to experience the objects.

426
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:58,599
They do it by telling us about the laws of association.

427
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:06,519
And nowadays it's empiricist, it's behaviorists, or really nowadays, in some way, I think it's neural net people.

428
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:16,120
I like neural nets, and I think probably it's unfair to say that people who are going to do neural nets and reinforcement learning are just behaviorists.

429
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:18,120
People like Fodor say that.

430
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:26,360
But for the sake of this rough taxonomy, we can say, though, it's an interesting issue, not for this course.

431
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:31,960
We try to figure out whether, in a way in psychology, this thing just keeps repeating itself.

432
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,400
The behaviorist found in the narrow story doesn't work.

433
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:44,519
So these other people, which who are the intellectualists, come around, and they're Kant and followers.

434
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:54,360
They say, well, you can't do this with these causal laws, but the mind has to do something to get from the impressions to objects.

435
00:34:54,360 --> 00:35:07,239
So what you do is you have a story about a judgment and subsuming these impressions under categories and finding their rule-like relations.

436
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:09,400
Instead of, let's start here now.

437
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:12,119
They got their meaningless impressions.

438
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:13,239
Let's put that up here.

439
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:15,840
Some kind of impression, some kind of given.

440
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:25,599
And then they're going to say that what you have to do is you find you have to, I like, what do I like next?

441
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:30,080
Instead of a causal account, you get a rule.

442
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,319
Rules, symbolic represent.

443
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:35,360
This could begin to be found in familiar.

444
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,039
That is, look, this fell into the bottom line.

445
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,239
This is cognitivism.

446
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:42,480
And it was artificial intelligence.

447
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,239
It died.

448
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,840
I mean, that symbolic representation died as a form of art.

449
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:56,239
If they found a way to make computers intelligent, but it's still something that is a going business, cognitivism.

450
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:00,960
And it's got, what else do I need?

451
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:03,120
Yeah.

452
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:05,600
Dash your hand.

453
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,400
Can you?

454
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,720
I'll read this now for you guys out there.

455
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,279
I really worry about this out there.

456
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,079
You don't.

457
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:13,679
Can you hear me out there?

458
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:14,079
Yeah.

459
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,199
Oh, well, good.

460
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:15,840
I'll just read it.

461
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,000
So I wrote analyzing.

462
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:26,240
Analyzing means sort of trying to find the rules or the principles.

463
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:35,280
Yeah, in Kant, it amounts to saying sort of what is the mental contribution.

464
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:40,720
Analyzing is as in the transcendental analytic.

465
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:50,879
You try to, in Kant, you try to find out what the contribution of the mind has to be to get from whatever the given input is to objects.

466
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,720
So you under analyzing, this is what Merlin-Conte calls the intellectualists.

467
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:04,360
And it's Kant and a whole lot of people that he talks a lot about who are French neo-Kantians, who you'll never have heard of.

468
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:06,519
I don't know, Le Chez Ray is one of them.

469
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:10,279
I can't remember because I never pay any attention since we never read them.

470
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:19,880
But anyway, Kant and all of his French followers, whatever they start with something too, that's some kind of given that is meaningless.

471
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:26,519
They don't call it impressions, but whatever they call it, I mean, I think they sometimes just call it the given.

472
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:40,920
And then they're going to try to find the mental machinery that gets you from this meaningless given to the experience of objects.

473
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,640
And cognitivism and AI is a part of it.

474
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:45,719
My teacher, C.I.

475
00:37:45,719 --> 00:38:06,600
Lewis, and you don't read anymore, was one of these neo-Kantians who tried to explain how the perceptual given, together with some whole conceptual machinery, enables you to have the experience of objects.

476
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:09,240
And so that's the other project.

477
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:17,480
And Meryl-Ponty wants to say that neither the empiricists or the intellectualists can account for perception.

478
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:26,679
And his argument goes, sort of as the history of psychology goes, sort of like what Kant calls an antinomy.

479
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,160
Each side tries to give their story.

480
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:31,160
It shows finally, it doesn't work.

481
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:37,720
We've just lived through this interesting one 50 years ago now, where finally Skinner's behaviorism does work.

482
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:46,960
Chomsky comes along and destroys it and says, well, the only other possibility is we're applying all these rules to language.

483
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,679
And then after a while, that doesn't work.

484
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:57,440
It's got so patched up with ad hoc attempts to save it that people stop believing it, and they go back to the other side again.

485
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:03,039
And that flip-flop is what Mero-Ponty makes into an argument.

486
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:09,839
And as an argument, an antinomy says, Well, there are only two possibilities, and if this one doesn't work, it must be the other one.

487
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,559
And then that one doesn't work, and it says it must be that one.

488
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:16,800
And the way out of an antinome is to say, well, these aren't the only two possibilities.

489
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:24,000
In Mero-Ponty, that means, well, let's say we don't start with these meaningless given sensations.

490
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,760
Since every time anybody tries to get from there to the meaningful world of objects, they can't do it.

491
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:40,559
And that, so his argument is always doing that, showing that neither the empiricists, first of all, always the empiricists can't do it, then it's the intellectualists can't do it, and he always looks more like the intellectuals.

492
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:53,840
He has much less sympathy for the empiricist, behaviorist British version than he does for the neo-conjugate, intellectualist, rationalist French version.

493
00:39:53,840 --> 00:40:02,640
After all, they're in the big line of Deshart, Leibniz, Kant, and not in the line of human lock, that they can't do it either.

494
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:24,160
And then saying, all we can do is give a description of what's going on, and that always turns out to be a Gestaltist story about, and this is also very important, it turns out to be a story that says always, well, the amazing thing about human experience is that the whole is prior to the parts.

495
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:29,880
That is, that you, what's wrong with both these views is that they're atomistic.

496
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,840
They're trying to build up experience out of elements.

497
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,960
You can't do that.

498
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:44,519
The way the brain works, and we don't know how the brain works, but however it works, we have an experience of the whole from the start, the world and us in it.

499
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:54,280
And we don't have an experience of these elements except insofar as we use some special analytic attitude to break down this whole into elements.

500
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,920
Or something goes wrong and it just breaks down.

501
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,559
Or we have brain injuries and then you get elements.

502
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:06,440
You know, there's a kind of brain injury where you get to be at convent where you have to be where you have to figure out, what's his name?

503
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:18,440
Oliver Sachs writes about it in the man who mistook his wife for a hat, who has to figure out what a glove is by saying, well, it's got five out poachings and it's got this and that.

504
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,399
And then he deduces that it's a glove.

505
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:30,760
And everything this guy does, he has to deduce, if you show him a triangle, he says, well, it's got this side and that side and that side and it's closed.

506
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,280
It's a closed figure.

507
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,640
It's a triangle.

508
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:40,039
Whereas the argument is supposed to be from Merlot Ponte, you can see from this breakdown, that's not how we do it.

509
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:45,000
We see a triangle first and then we see these lines as composing it.

510
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:54,600
So the general argument always is that there's some third thing that comes out of this holism.

511
00:41:54,599 --> 00:42:03,799
For instance, if you read later, you'll read, if you read Mark Rathol's paper, which is, what's the title?

512
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:10,200
Motives, reasons, and causes, you can see you've got causes over here.

513
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,359
Where do we put causes?

514
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,800
Causes.

515
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:15,759
We put reasons over here.

516
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,559
I put rules.

517
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:25,039
Well, he gives you a whole story about trying to have a causal account of perception, trying to have a rationalist rule account.

518
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:38,160
And then he introduces this descriptive, weird notion of what he calls a motive, which isn't like a motive, or you know, did you have a motive when you killed him, kind of motive.

519
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:47,280
What a motive is, is a tendency in experience to organize so as to produce better and better gestalts.

520
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,239
And we'll have a lot to say about that, lots to say about that later.

521
00:42:50,239 --> 00:43:04,320
But that's supposed to be an example of how you sort of break the antinome by coming in with your whole Gestalt story and then having an account of each of these opposed views by introducing some third thing.

522
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,920
Motive is very obscure.

523
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,919
It's very hard to know what he's talking about.

524
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:14,640
It isn't part of our normal vocabulary, common sense or scientific.

525
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:17,519
And his view is you've got to have a whole new version.

526
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:43,360
If you stick to description, you're going to need a whole new vocabulary because common sense and science are equally wrong because they don't understand the Gestalt story, because they think that experience and the physical universe and the everyday world can all be broken down into elements and built up out of the elements, and that's just wrong from the story we're going to tell.

527
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:44,000
Yeah.

528
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,480
When do you reference Gestalt?

529
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:50,399
Oh, oh boy, I thought you'd be perfectly sensible to ask that.

530
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,559
That's a ground floor question we better be dealing with.

531
00:43:54,559 --> 00:44:01,000
You'll notice that he's that you could have asked it right away, but you could always ask about the reading.

532
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:09,639
And when he says, notice right in the middle of page four, which is that huge paragraph that doesn't help much that they didn't kind of like.

533
00:44:09,639 --> 00:44:14,599
But anyway, in the middle of page four, he says, when Gestalt, it's perfect to read that right now.

534
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:17,799
And I'm answering you as I read it, as soon as I read it.

535
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:37,879
When Gestalt's theory informs us that a figure on the background is the simplest sense-giving available to us, that's Gestalt, then we, this is Merlot-Ponty, reply, that this isn't a contingent characteristic of factual perception, which leaves us free in an ideal analysis to bring in the notion of impressions.

536
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,480
Those would be the elements.

537
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:48,680
It is the very definition of the phenomena of perception, and without that, without which a phenomenon cannot be said to be perception at all.

538
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:52,600
The perceptual something is always in the middle of something else.

539
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:55,240
It always forms part of a field.

540
00:44:55,239 --> 00:45:04,200
Okay, the Gestalt psychologists were writing in, what, the early 1900s, I think.

541
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,519
That's right, isn't it, I guess?

542
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:13,639
And they are, their names, I won't write them on the board, but their famous ones are Kafka, I think K-O-F-F-K-A.

543
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,159
Well, you'll find it in the footnotes.

544
00:45:15,159 --> 00:45:16,199
He refers to them a lot.

545
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:20,200
Kafka, Werkheimer, those are the main two.

546
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:29,559
And they are the ones who introduced this idea that Gestalt, which is their name for this hole that I was talking about.

547
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:31,640
Gestalt means form.

548
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,760
But it doesn't mean platonic kind of form.

549
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:43,399
It means that there's always some whole of which, whatever, more basic than the elements.

550
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:44,920
Let me explain some more of that.

551
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:57,440
There's this deep misunderstanding around, I think, that people say all the time, you read in books, that the Gestaltists said that the whole was greater than the sum of the parts.

552
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:02,319
They probably did say that, but that's a trivial thing to say.

553
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,000
They wouldn't have gotten very far.

554
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,680
Because that's obviously true, even the brick wall.

555
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:12,160
The brick wall is certainly more than the sum of all the bricks in it.

556
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:14,400
But that's not what they're trying to say.

557
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:20,160
They're trying to say something much stronger, that the whole determines what counts as a part.

558
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,039
But if you had the brick wall, you could have sensations.

559
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:28,400
I mean, the brick wall, every brick is like a sensation, and then you give us the rule for putting it together as a wall.

560
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,599
That's not what they think.

561
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,680
That's what they think is wrong.

562
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:36,400
And their kind of example is a melody.

563
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:53,200
And they claim that the same note, let's say C, middle C, which is the same in the sense that you get the same frequency, and if you hear that frequency alone, you hear every time you hear it, it sounds the same.

564
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:57,039
That same note will sound different in different melodies.

565
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:04,720
It gets a certain quality from being in a certain place in the whole.

566
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:06,159
I wish I could think of more.

567
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:11,440
I mean, it's so pervasive what they're saying, but that's the only example that keeps getting.

568
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,639
Let me see if I know any others that's an example of work.

569
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:16,960
Right.

570
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,679
Oh, yeah, that's right.

571
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:18,159
That's good.

572
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:18,360
Yeah.

573
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,160
See, that's another example they have.

574
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:22,000
You can do, what is it?

575
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,279
Tap and pat?

576
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,319
No, it isn't cat.

577
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:27,319
It has to be something, the letters and the letters.

578
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:27,840
Right.

579
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:30,440
Let's see if we can write one on the board.

580
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,480
What are they?

581
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,519
The hat and something.

582
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:36,120
Well, but if someone is the cat can't be right, can it?

583
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,719
Because it just won't work.

584
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:38,839
Well, go try it.

585
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,039
Ah, the duck the duck rabbit is terrific.

586
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:45,399
They're all full of good examples.

587
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,000
I don't know why I couldn't have thought of them.

588
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,559
I was stuck in the chapter all morning.

589
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:53,159
But he's gonna he's gonna tell us how to do it.

590
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:54,039
So you have it.

591
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:55,320
Okay, and now what happens?

592
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,679
Well, if you now it's the okay, go ahead.

593
00:47:59,159 --> 00:47:59,719
Okay, good.

594
00:47:59,719 --> 00:48:11,719
So the the gestalt, the overall whatever, determines the meaning of or what counts as or how we see well, how what we see to be the supposed elements.

595
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:13,240
Oh, I just remembered another one.

596
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:22,039
There's so many you think of there's something called the word superiority effect, which I don't know what people do with, but in the old days it was a big problem for cognitive.

597
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:42,679
It turns out that if I was going to ask about that one next, let me do while I think of this one, it turns out to be the case that you can recognize a word faster than you can recognize letters in the word, which suggests that the way your mind works is you grasp the gestalt.

598
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,160
It's just more of this same story.

599
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:48,519
You grasp that before you grasp the letters in it.

600
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:49,880
We just showed that.

601
00:48:49,880 --> 00:49:05,559
Or or the duck rabbit, as somebody here said rightly, well, if this is a duck looking that way, when we draw it, there should be something that's the eye of the duck in one moment.

602
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,799
Well, I don't have the stones in there.

603
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:10,440
Okay, yeah, there's a rabbit and it looks that way.

604
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,039
That's not a stuck with the eye.

605
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,079
Okay, I know that.

606
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:29,679
But you as the way I remember it, What you need in a duck rabbit is not only you can do two things with it.

607
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:31,440
You can say, look, it's an ambiguous figure.

608
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,800
You can see it two ways.

609
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:38,080
And which way you see it will depend on what you've got surrounding it or what you expect.

610
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:40,559
But there is another thing that you see about it.

611
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:49,680
I always see when I see the drawings of it, is the Gestalt point that what looks like a black spot in one is the eye of the other one.

612
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:57,440
Or in all these ambiguous figures, of course, like the woman who's an old lady or a girl and so forth, everything switches.

613
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,360
What looks like her nose in one is her scarf in another.

614
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,360
And those are all Gestalt.

615
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,199
No, that's the motor liar illusion.

616
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:10,319
That's another Gestalt phenomenon that he talks about.

617
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:13,199
Those lines at the bottom of where, what page are you on?

618
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,120
Pick.

619
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:24,480
Where the overall thing, which is getting those two things on the end of these, those two lines are equal.

620
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,760
It's hard to believe.

621
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,960
But you measure them.

622
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,640
They better turn out to be.

623
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:36,079
But what counts as the length of the line is determined by the overall Gestalt.

624
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:39,519
And so you switch the length of the line by putting the ends on there.

625
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:43,360
Anyway, so the Gestaltists, this is all worth going through.

626
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:57,280
We're just spending their time doing marvelous experiments to show that the hole determines what counts as a part, that we always see things first in terms of holes, and then looking out in every direction.

627
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:17,480
And you'll find them their work coming up again and again and again in the in this book, because they were doing the the phenomenology of of perception and and resisting the it's the both both the empiricist and the uh intellectualist uh versions of perception.

628
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:23,640
They were way ahead of their time in a way because they thought there must be fields in the brain that corresponded to these holes.

629
00:51:23,639 --> 00:51:36,840
And now there are lots of brain models of, say, attractors and so forth where there are holes, where there don't seem to be holistic phenomena in the brain correlated with perception.

630
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,719
It's an interesting story.

631
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:38,759
I can't go into it too much.

632
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:49,559
The Gestaltists went and tried to find in the brain these holes and they just didn't have the equipment and they couldn't find it and that was used so much against them that they just disappeared.

633
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:51,000
I mean they dropped out.

634
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:58,039
Kohler was teaching at Swarthmore which is a pretty good place to be but given that he was sort of that genius of a whole little movement.

635
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:01,000
It just was wasn't where he should have been.

636
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,440
And by the way TOTUS was a protégé of Kohler so this sort of comes together in a way.

637
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:17,559
TOTIC was an undergraduate at Swathmore until when he read Meryloponte it always seemed just perfectly obvious and clear to him and which was Meriloponte and which wasn't.

638
00:52:17,559 --> 00:52:20,919
It was very helpful to have him as a fellow graduate student.

639
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,439
Okay, back to this.

640
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:25,400
Any more comments on that?

641
00:52:27,639 --> 00:52:28,280
Yeah.

642
00:52:29,159 --> 00:52:30,519
About impressionism.

643
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:31,239
Yeah, right.

644
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:32,680
Yeah.

645
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:33,479
Right.

646
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:39,159
I wonder, do you think that that according to Malong Merlotty or Never Impression?

647
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,960
Well, I think he thinks you can get them.

648
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:46,399
I think he thinks there are two places where he seems to talk about what it would be to get them.

649
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:51,599
One is the sort of funny thing at the beginning of the book where he asks himself, well, what would it be like to have an impression?

650
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:55,920
And he says, in effect, it would be like waking up in the morning before you've got any wits at all.

651
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,960
Where is that?

652
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,400
It's right at the beginning of what we're reading, I believe.

653
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:11,279
Well, I'm looking at page four, and he just invites how the pure impression is therefore not only indiscoverable, but also imperceptible and so inconceivable.

654
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:11,440
Ah.

655
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:12,480
And it incidentally perceptible.

656
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:16,319
Okay, so I'm not sure if he really wants to make this really strong question.

657
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:16,799
Yeah.

658
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,079
I think it's always within the whole, even the rainbow cases.

659
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:20,559
Okay.

660
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,159
I'm going to say something about that.

661
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:28,319
But here, by the way, is this where he talks about the sounds that encroach on my drowsiness?

662
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,760
They're in my head.

663
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,600
And when I close my eyes.

664
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:36,399
And so he tries there to say what would become close to being an impression.

665
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,319
It would have to be just something so meaningless that it wasn't even in the world.

666
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,320
It was just a state of me.

667
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,680
That's one example.

668
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:50,879
The other one in the Down of Cézanne, he seems to think that painters, after much effort, can see impressions.

669
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:56,000
And his big example is the cathedral at Louis, painted by Monet at various times of day.

670
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,480
I mentioned that, where he could see just the color patches.

671
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,559
We've got to get on to color patches pretty soon.

672
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:11,359
But one version of impression would be sheer color qualities, which don't get affected by the whole.

673
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:31,320
I mean, the whole point of these pictures of the Rouen Cathedral is supposed to be that Monet is managing to paint the various colors from sort of purple to orange to yellow and so forth and how they change as the lighting changes as if they were meaningless and isolable color impressions.

674
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:34,359
So I think, let me say, well, I'll let you talk in a minute.

675
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:37,079
I think that there are two stories going on at once.

676
00:54:37,239 --> 00:54:38,680
I was puzzled by this.

677
00:54:38,679 --> 00:54:45,080
There's one, which is the Hegelian story, and that is the very notion of an impression is inconceivable.

678
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:48,440
That's how Hegel begins the phenomenology of mind.

679
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:57,559
And that says, if you take the notion of impression absolutely seriously, so that it isn't meaningful at all.

680
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,119
It isn't even categorizable.

681
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:02,599
It can't even be a red patch in here and out.

682
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:08,600
Hegel says already, look at this, you're using the word red, you're relating it to other red patches and so forth.

683
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:10,600
That's not a pure impression.

684
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:12,920
A pure impression, you just have to go, ah.

685
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:17,240
And then, and you, so Hegel says there is no pure impression.

686
00:55:17,239 --> 00:55:22,519
But Merlot-Ponty is much more interested, although he makes that move in here, that there's no such thing.

687
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:36,280
He's really interested in what the impressionists thought they were talking about, which was something like a red patch here and now, and that is supposed to be the minimal stuff of the experience.

688
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:45,240
And then he thinks that you can break down your experience and actually have sense impressions.

689
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:52,920
And he's got all kinds of evidence for that, from brain-injured people to great painters.

690
00:55:52,920 --> 00:56:03,640
But he thinks that that only comes when you get really analytically skilled at undermining the gestalt, the whole in which it appears.

691
00:56:03,639 --> 00:56:05,480
Never mind the Hegelian one.

692
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,639
I mean, that's not interesting to us.

693
00:56:07,639 --> 00:56:19,039
And I don't know why he's bothering to tell us that the really pure, absolutely meaningless, absolutely uninterpreted theory doesn't exist.

694
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:21,280
That's not what he's concerned to argue.

695
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:27,519
He's concerned to argue that the impressions of the empiricists don't exist.

696
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:29,039
Well, no, that's not.

697
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:31,839
No, wait, not quite.

698
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:50,160
He's arguing that the impressions of the empiricist don't normally take be are not normally a part of our experience, but they do exist in the sense that if you get in a certain attitude, you can get something like an impression.

699
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:52,960
Introspectionists were supposed to be doing that all along.

700
00:56:52,960 --> 00:57:03,039
They were able to study what their experience was like when they didn't see it in a context, didn't interpret it, and so forth.

701
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:03,920
You look worried.

702
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:11,519
Yeah, because I'm thinking maybe an alpha explanation that he might be getting on the very exact.

703
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:17,920
So like the breakdown phases and the same phases would still be an example of default at work.

704
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,000
I don't think that's what you're talking about.

705
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,400
No, no, he's because of the motor liar illusion and so forth.

706
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,199
He says you can isolate it from the ends.

707
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:32,960
If you get really skilled so you could see that illusion without the ends, you'd see that the two lines were the same.

708
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,480
That means there really is, so to speak, an impression there.

709
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:41,199
There really is, well, oh boy, that's a wrong thing to say.

710
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:42,400
You got to be careful.

711
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,599
That's a dilemma, I think.

712
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:46,559
No, no, not a dilemma, but something very important.

713
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,280
Which is jumping ahead, but we better say it now.

714
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:55,680
I mean, if you can break down your experience, does that show the impressions were there all along.

715
00:57:55,679 --> 00:57:57,679
It helps you to look ahead.

716
00:57:57,679 --> 00:57:59,799
That's the issue of the chapter on attention.

717
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,199
That's the next chapter after the one on...

718
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:05,720
Well, first we get the sensation chapter, which we're talking about.

719
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:13,640
Then we get the association chapter, which is how the empiricist tries to get objects back from sensations by way of association.

720
00:58:13,639 --> 00:58:15,480
Then we get the attention chapter.

721
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:22,600
The attention chapter says, well, look, these, I'm making it simple in connection with what I just said.

722
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:27,240
Well, look, these impressionists can break down their experience into impressions.

723
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:30,200
And they were what was there all along.

724
00:58:30,199 --> 00:58:31,799
That's the crucial move.

725
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:44,360
If we really get good at paying attention, as these artists are, and these introspectionist psychologists are, we discover impressions and we discover them.

726
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:47,400
That's the sensory core theory, he calls it.

727
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:54,919
That's the theory that we can break down the Gestalt and find the impression of the data.

728
00:58:55,239 --> 00:58:57,480
Now, there are two parts to that.

729
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:04,920
One, that we can break down the Gestalt, and I think he thinks we can, but after all, there's been ages of impressionists did it.

730
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:09,240
And then that reveals what is there all along.

731
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:13,960
Oh, I think he calls it, the sensory core theory is what people called it when I was a graduate student.

732
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:17,239
He calls it the exposure hypothesis, right?

733
00:59:17,239 --> 00:59:18,359
Does that sound familiar?

734
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,199
The exposure hypothesis, same thing.

735
00:59:20,199 --> 00:59:24,519
The exposure hypothesis says you've revealed what was there all along.

736
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:28,119
He says, one, there's no evidence for that.

737
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:29,880
Why should we believe that?

738
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:41,320
And two, if we had, if we did believe it, we'd be right back at his arguments in chapter one, that you couldn't figure out how to get from there to the the hole, which you have destroyed brilliantly.

739
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:45,000
And that's because the the hole was never made out of these therapy.

740
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:10,559
Looking at their forms instead of their detail or elements that make them up, we were talking about our team.

741
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:11,519
Yes.

742
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:21,440
But, and when we should wait till we get to the attention chapter, the argument is supposed to be they were there all along, but we weren't paying sufficient clear analytic attention.

743
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:25,759
We had this sort of confused Gestalt experience.

744
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:33,680
I mean, it's no, no Gestalt is going to buy this, but there's certainly something you can say if you can break it down into these elements.

745
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,519
Why shouldn't we think that it was made up of these elements?

746
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:41,600
And the Gestalt's going to say, you've got none of that in your experience.

747
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:48,800
And the attention person is going to say, well, not in your everyday not paying attention, coping with objects kind of experience.

748
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:52,639
But you've got it there on the margin of your experience.

749
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:53,920
Well, how do we know that?

750
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,600
Well, because by paying attention, you will see it.

751
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:04,880
And then the model of attention is a kind of spotlight which you shine on this and discover it was there all along.

752
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:23,200
So you've got to change your whole view of what attention is so that you can argue that you get that there is no such thing as that kind of attention where you just discover that something or other which you didn't have in your normal everyday experience was there all along.

753
01:01:23,199 --> 01:01:24,399
There is something like that.

754
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:33,159
There is paying more attention to the details of your experience, but not uh well, do I mistake?

755
01:01:33,159 --> 01:01:34,839
You can have this wait a minute.

756
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:37,319
So there's no I misspoke.

757
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:40,760
It's not that there never could be such an ex uh a breakdown.

758
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:43,320
It's just that he wants to argue it's a breakdown.

759
01:01:44,679 --> 01:01:56,360
There is no good argument that it was dimly in your experience, which is what you were when you were you want to say, why should we phenomenologists and gestaltists think that this was dimly there all along?

760
01:01:56,360 --> 01:02:02,920
Well, there's an assumption about what attention is, namely that it brings out what was there all along.

761
01:02:03,239 --> 01:02:08,760
And it's true, since it's true that you can, by attention, isolate these elements.

762
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:19,480
If you also believe that attention is what brings out what was there all along, and then of course you're you're where you want to be, or not you want to be, but the anti-defyus wants to be.

763
01:02:19,639 --> 01:02:20,039
Yeah.

764
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:22,440
That's right.

765
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:29,000
You said that, but I don't think that's right.

766
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,920
I mean, I was sort of disagreeing with that.

767
01:02:31,239 --> 01:02:32,200
That's true.

768
01:02:32,199 --> 01:02:38,279
But the issue isn't whether they were there in the world all along, or whether they were there in your experience all along.

769
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:40,039
And that's what I was answering.

770
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:46,519
Now, there were people, Burke Russell at a certain stage, thought that there were sense data in the world all along.

771
01:02:46,519 --> 01:02:52,039
And that we that's what we really experienced because they were out there.

772
01:02:52,039 --> 01:02:53,559
But you don't have to hold that.

773
01:02:53,719 --> 01:02:56,679
That's a really big I gather Russell gave it up.

774
01:02:56,679 --> 01:03:16,640
But anyway, so all you really need to be in if to be on the column over here of empiricists is to claim that in your experience there is data which is not produced by the whole, but which is what makes, what would be put together to make up the whole.

775
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:20,959
If that isn't, maybe a happy time talking puzzle.

776
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:21,440
Yeah.

777
01:03:21,679 --> 01:03:23,440
Can you be totally explicit in my opinion?

778
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:25,199
Well, it covers too many things.

779
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:26,240
That's a good question.

780
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:30,799
I mean, if you that's what came up with Rick's question.

781
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:44,159
I mean, if you think an impression is just the absolute minimum of whole meaninglessness and uncategorized, then you go in the Hegel direction and you get that becomes an unintelligible huh.

782
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:49,039
And you can't say anything about it because as soon as you say anything about it, you already categorize it.

783
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:53,119
Charles Taylor does a great version of that in his Hegel book.

784
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:55,119
And that's one way.

785
01:03:56,239 --> 01:04:09,680
But you can also think that an impression is any perceptual experience which has a determinate character and is independent of any context.

786
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:14,880
And that's what the impressionist is trying to do in making their painting or what the Gestalt is.

787
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:22,960
They're trying to isolate this experience from the context and what's left is the impression.

788
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:31,199
And it's further complicated just so you know by this epistemological issue because the sense data stuff is supposed to be indubitable.

789
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:33,840
That was the big deal when I was a graduate student.

790
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:34,239
C.I.

791
01:04:34,239 --> 01:04:40,079
Lewis thought that you've got to have something called the given as the rock bottom of knowledge.

792
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:42,000
It goes back to Descartes.

793
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:44,639
And so you get two things when you do this.

794
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:53,760
So they were busy, the sense data people, trying to get back to these impressions because they were the basis of knowledge.

795
01:04:53,760 --> 01:05:06,039
But there are also these psychological types who don't care about building their knowledge on indubitable impressions, but they want to know how the impressions get put together to give us an experience of objects.

796
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:11,879
And that's the same impressions, I think, that they're just using in two different ways.

797
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:17,000
There's an epistemological story, and then there's a what?

798
01:05:18,119 --> 01:05:33,640
Philosophical story of how to explain how we get the hume issue and the Kant issue, how we get an experience of a whole with whole objects in it, given that what we start with are these context-free impressions.

799
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,000
You got a hand up?

800
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:35,399
Yeah.

801
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:44,679
Something like the Gonsfield experiments kind of show that the equivalent of creating or trying to create pure sensation or pure impression is simply not to receive.

802
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:46,920
Tell me more.

803
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:50,519
Do you think they put the goggles over somebody's eyes or the other?

804
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:51,399
Okay, yeah.

805
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,279
They create essentially a constant impression.

806
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:59,320
The consequence seems to be that you simply stop seeing or you simply stop computing.

807
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:00,839
That's fine.

808
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:02,839
But that's that sort of the Hegel thing.

809
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:13,479
If an impression were sort of so undifferentiated that it didn't even have any color or any shape, that's what you can't get.

810
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:22,679
And if you give people a world in which there is this thing like when you're waking up in which there is nothing, just a sort of fog, they don't see anything.

811
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:23,640
That's the point.

812
01:06:23,639 --> 01:06:27,319
But remember that the impression, again, it's sort of like his point.

813
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:33,960
Guevane an impression, just keep telling yourself it's something like red patch here now.

814
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:38,440
That is, it's context-free, it's completely determinate.

815
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:49,439
But that doesn't mean that it has to have no color and can't be, because it's true that if it has a color, you seem to be already saying something more about it than minimal.

816
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,239
But they were willing to say something more about it than minimal.

817
01:06:52,239 --> 01:06:57,519
All they cared about is that it was context-free and determinate.

818
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:00,239
Did I have any other thing on my little list when I read it?

819
01:07:00,239 --> 01:07:01,920
If so, it's time to go back to it.

820
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:03,280
Just a second.

821
01:07:04,159 --> 01:07:07,840
I don't want to lose the opportunity to connect up with one thing I already said.

822
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,119
What happened to page one?

823
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,239
Isolable.

824
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:11,679
Oh, that's just context-free.

825
01:07:11,679 --> 01:07:12,079
Good.

826
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:12,559
Okay.

827
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:14,000
Yeah, that's all I said.

828
01:07:14,719 --> 01:07:21,279
Now, so I've got to go back to this for a while because I wanted to go slowly, but not that slow.

829
01:07:21,519 --> 01:07:24,399
I'm on page two, and I want to.

830
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:26,960
So we.

831
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:37,279
So I've done my page.

832
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:39,199
I want to feel happy.

833
01:07:39,519 --> 01:07:41,599
Well, I want to.

834
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:43,599
Okay, I guess it's here.

835
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:44,000
I see.

836
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:44,719
Yeah, now I see.

837
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:47,279
I don't know what happened to page one, but I don't need it.

838
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,480
So we've got the critique of empiricism.

839
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,200
I'm giving you the overall finding of the book.

840
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:54,320
And there we are.

841
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:57,199
And we share this common assumption about the world.

842
01:07:57,199 --> 01:07:58,159
There's faith one.

843
01:07:58,480 --> 01:07:59,279
Fair luck.

844
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:03,759
That doesn't need it, except it's reality.

845
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:09,440
Okay, so now, and Merloponty, in chapter four, I was just running over the whole layout.

846
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:29,119
In chapter four, Merloponty is going to propose instead his view, which you could call existential phenomenology, that our experience of the world and of objects is field-like from the always normal experience.

847
01:08:29,119 --> 01:08:46,439
I think when you really say experience, you always, I want to say normal, because after all, there are these introspectionists and these train injured people and these artists who can have these, not the absolute minimal kind, but the kind that the humans would be happy with.

848
01:08:46,439 --> 01:08:54,359
But normally, we experience what he calls a phenomenal field, which is correlative with our body.

849
01:08:54,359 --> 01:08:59,880
Our body is going to turn out to be the sort of most basic holism.

850
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:05,639
And the way the body is holistic sort of rubs off on everything else in experience.

851
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:09,639
And the way the body organizes.

852
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:16,840
The body organizes this phenomenal field from the biggest to more and more restricted fields.

853
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:26,439
TOTUS is very good on that, about various fields, vertical, horizontal, and so forth, that the body organizes.

854
01:09:26,439 --> 01:09:32,519
Okay, now, just believe it or not, I got to the sensation chapter, which is what I was going to talk about today.

855
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:36,599
So let's see if I can skim this is what I want to make sure we get across.

856
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:46,199
Another way I wrote it here is we wanted the sensations are supposed to be the raw material out of which the world is put together.

857
01:09:46,199 --> 01:09:57,479
And we assume there are such things because we think that we read back our experience of objects.

858
01:09:57,479 --> 01:09:59,319
This is what I was a long time ago.

859
01:09:59,319 --> 01:10:04,920
And that gets us to this important story about Geschwalt's, which is where we were thanks to this question.

860
01:10:05,239 --> 01:10:09,159
And I want to read you on page four, even if we don't get past page four.

861
01:10:10,279 --> 01:10:14,960
He describes the Geschwald phenomena right before he gets to what I read last time.

862
01:10:14,439 --> 01:10:20,079
He says, think of what you might think of as a simple impression.

863
01:10:21,039 --> 01:10:26,559
I'm now reading about five lines down on page four, which is still in that one huge paragraph.

864
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:32,559
Now he says, Let us imagine a white patch on a homogeneous background.

865
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:36,559
Well, that is a simple impression, you would think, if ever you had one.

866
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,519
But he then gives you a Gestalt analysis of it.

867
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:45,759
All the points in the patch have a certain function in common, that of forming themselves into a shape.

868
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:49,760
That's like to say that the sides of a triangle don't just look like lines.

869
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,920
They look like sides of triangles.

870
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:55,039
It's like the way the notes look in the music or sound.

871
01:10:55,039 --> 01:11:00,239
The color of the shape is more intense and, as it were, more resistant than that of the background.

872
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:07,439
The edges of the patch belong to it, like the sides of the triangle, and are not part of the background, although they adjoin it.

873
01:11:07,439 --> 01:11:10,000
The patch appears to be placed on the background.

874
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,439
It does not break it up.

875
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:20,079
That is, you experience the background is going on under this white patch, not as if this white patch were a hole in a black background.

876
01:11:20,079 --> 01:11:25,679
He's telling you all that is already involved in this very minimal.

877
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:30,079
Supposed in perception, it's already holistic.

878
01:11:31,039 --> 01:11:32,960
The hole is defining the edges.

879
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,039
The hole is affecting the color.

880
01:11:35,039 --> 01:11:39,519
The hole is selecting the spot out against the background.

881
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:48,159
And then he says, what I read before, there's always a figure on a background, which is a further, Gestalt's point.

882
01:11:48,479 --> 01:12:02,840
Now, something crossed my mind as I was saying, and I was thinking this, namely that I wanted to make sure that I told you for the next four minutes or five minutes, I want to tell you about an important mistranslations that may have messed you up when you tried to read this.

883
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:04,760
Right after what I just read, where it says feel.

884
01:12:06,039 --> 01:12:16,279
It says, A really homogeneous area offering nothing to be cannot be given to any perception.

885
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,880
It says, offering nothing to see in the frame.

886
01:12:20,039 --> 01:12:25,639
This is amazing that this has been through, I don't know, 30 printings, and they haven't just simply corrected that.

887
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:26,599
You see where we are?

888
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:30,279
Okay, where it says Gestalt theory informs us stuff about the field.

889
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:32,359
That's right after what I was reading about.

890
01:12:32,359 --> 01:12:34,519
Right after the stuff about the point.

891
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:39,079
Then there's the Gestalt, when Gestalt theory informs us.

892
01:12:39,079 --> 01:12:43,239
That's brilliant because I finished that whole thing up to feel.

893
01:12:43,239 --> 01:12:44,039
You got that now?

894
01:12:45,399 --> 01:12:45,640
Yes.

895
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:52,039
Now the next sentence, a really homogeneous area offering nothing to be cannot be given to any perception.

896
01:12:52,039 --> 01:12:52,840
That's nonsense.

897
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,920
It's offering nothing to see.

898
01:12:55,880 --> 01:13:00,679
While I'm at it, let's go back to the thing I just read.

899
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:03,079
It's full of bad translations.

900
01:13:03,079 --> 01:13:07,880
Going back to each part arouses the expectations of more.

901
01:13:08,279 --> 01:13:11,399
Philip Huntington Francis announces more.

902
01:13:11,399 --> 01:13:14,519
That's a kind of, I don't say, metaphor.

903
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:23,159
But what we should avoid is expectation, because expectation is much too intellectual and mental.

904
01:13:23,159 --> 01:13:34,279
I mean, it isn't as if each part in this little part you're describing leads us to expect the background underneath and expect the edge and so forth.

905
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:41,719
It's, I want to say something like, each part arouses a readiness for more.

906
01:13:42,039 --> 01:13:50,880
That is, when you see any part of it, you're already getting ready to see other aspects of it.

907
01:13:51,039 --> 01:13:52,159
And now let me go on.

908
01:13:52,479 --> 01:13:57,599
More than it contains, and this elementary perception is therefore already charged with a meaning.

909
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,519
Again, too intellectual.

910
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,279
In French, it's sance, S-E-N-S.

911
01:14:03,279 --> 01:14:07,599
Sance is a very, very much more general word.

912
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,439
And so you should look at their sense.

913
01:14:09,439 --> 01:14:11,039
We have a word like that in English.

914
01:14:11,039 --> 01:14:16,719
Every charged with sense, meaning that it points beyond itself.

915
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:19,599
So the edges point to the figure.

916
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:24,399
And the figure points beyond itself to the background that's being covered up.

917
01:14:24,399 --> 01:14:26,719
Okay, one, two more, and I'll stop.

918
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:28,319
That whole sentence is messed up.

919
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:30,000
So charged with meaning.

920
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:36,079
But if the shape and the background, say figure effect, it's just common gestalt talk.

921
01:14:36,079 --> 01:14:37,119
They never say shape.

922
01:14:37,119 --> 01:14:38,159
They always say figure.

923
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:40,079
Figure is in a relative with that way.

924
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:44,159
There's always a figure on a ground, and any ground has a figure.

925
01:14:44,479 --> 01:14:49,279
They're interdefined, where shape is just could be out of context.

926
01:14:49,279 --> 01:14:51,199
Okay, and now let's go on.

927
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:59,279
But if the figure and the background as a whole are not sensed, they must, this is a weird sentence.

928
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:00,960
I couldn't think this out for a long time.

929
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:01,760
Are not sensed.

930
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:05,119
They must, let's see, they must be sensed.

931
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:07,279
Are not sensed?

932
01:15:07,279 --> 01:15:08,719
I can't even read it now.

933
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:09,600
Let me try again.

934
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,079
We quite aroused blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

935
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:18,119
But if the figure and the background as a whole are not sense.

936
01:15:18,119 --> 01:15:23,599
Uh they must be sensed when they object in each of their points.

937
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:29,960
That if you can write instead of whole, collection.

938
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:30,760
That makes sense.

939
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:32,920
The French is ensemble.

940
01:15:33,239 --> 01:15:44,599
And it says if the figure in the background as a ensemble, as a collection, aren't thin, they must be thin when they object in each of their points.

941
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:48,519
Well, see, it isn't as if they've got these points.

942
01:15:48,520 --> 01:16:00,439
And suddenly it sounds like you're stopping the Gestalt story and where the points are all defined by the whole, and you're saying that what you really get is a lot of points.

943
01:16:00,439 --> 01:16:24,039
Well, that says if you saw the figure in the background as a collection instead of a whole, then you would, I think he's saying, uh, but if the figure in the background as a whole are not thin, they must be different if they give you the point.

944
01:16:24,039 --> 01:16:26,759
Um I don't know what that says.

945
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:31,799
But uh but if you write I think collection instead of whole, that's the right translation.

946
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:39,239
So if you've got the right translation, you figure out uh okay, that's we got we got clue page one.

947
01:16:39,239 --> 01:16:40,439
This is hard going.

948
01:16:40,439 --> 01:16:44,199
But we you you do the assignment for next week 'cause I'm gonna rush through it.

949
01:16:44,199 --> 01:16:46,439
I've gotta go faster from here on.
