1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,120
I guess the biggest thing I want to say first is it's if the I remember I told you this, but it's important to know that from 122 to 140, he's explaining Yelp Goldstein.

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:21,201
And I'm going to go through it in detail because it's so hard and yet so interesting, because they are Gestaltists.

3
00:00:21,201 --> 00:00:24,240
And like Gestaltists, they've got it sort of right.

4
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:26,000
They've got it sort of wrong.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So it just occurs to me as I'm talking to you that a further complication I didn't realize till this minute is that they've got it wrong in a different way than Kafka and Kohler have got it wrong.

6
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:42,480
It's not the same mistake that he's accusing them of.

7
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,601
Well, in the end it is.

8
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:46,640
In the end it is.

9
00:00:46,641 --> 00:00:48,161
So they've got it wrong.

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:01:05,040
At the deepest and most broad level, they both, that is the Gestaltists we studied when we did the perception part on sensation and association and Yelp Goldstein, who are these neuro-Gestalt people, have all missed being in the world.

11
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:30,840
And it always comes back to that again, that they try to understand these Gestalts without bringing in this way that organisms are always involved in the world trying to achieve something, what John Kelly calls the normative dimension, that there's always something that they can be, that they're trying to do that they can do better or worse.

12
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,200
That's the deep level that the Gestaltists miss and that Gal Goldstein misses.

13
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:37,881
But now we have to go into detail.

14
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:49,560
But I want to make one other general statement, which I really didn't realize fully until this time through, that there's a big chunk you can skip, which isn't really getting us anywhere.

15
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:52,040
Now I wrote down very clearly.

16
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,921
I know where it is.

17
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:53,561
Here it is.

18
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,840
From 141 to 150.

19
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,000
Rereading it, I just found myself marking nothing.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:10,360
He's going on and on in some detailed argument with intellectualists and empiricists, but not of the kind that we know, that's a neuro kind.

21
00:02:10,361 --> 00:02:14,201
And it's not advancing the argument a bit as far as I can see.

22
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,841
So you can, I mean, you don't have to skip it.

23
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:23,641
In fact, of course, I would recommend that you read it because maybe there's something in there that I miss that I don't see anything.

24
00:02:24,441 --> 00:02:31,320
So, I mean, TG is what's being done from 122 to 140.

25
00:02:31,961 --> 00:02:35,961
You could sort of get along without that too, but I'm going to try to explain that.

26
00:02:35,961 --> 00:02:43,081
But then you can skip 140 to 1 to 140.

27
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:47,160
There's at least plenty to struggle with and to read.

28
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,361
So let's start.

29
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:49,641
Did you see that?

30
00:02:49,641 --> 00:02:50,201
Okay.

31
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,680
And now, let's go to going into this in detail.

32
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,160
As I find the first page.

33
00:02:58,521 --> 00:02:59,480
Okay.

34
00:03:00,121 --> 00:03:07,000
So it's first we have to look at what Georg and Goldstein think is normal.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,641
And they've got a fairly okay view of the normal phenomenon, but they've always got.

36
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,561
Can you close the door already?

37
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,001
There's an adventure window.

38
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:21,200
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:22,881 --> 00:03:26,561
Let me leave the windows open when there's everything's open in the big room.

40
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,320
And if he gets took hold on the people by the window, he can close that too.

41
00:03:30,321 --> 00:03:34,320
Okay, so let's start with the take of 125.

42
00:03:34,641 --> 00:03:41,680
I'm going to have to stick very close to the text because it's trying to unravel the text that you get into all the things.

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:04:11,521
Well, really, at the bottom of 124, they're basic, let me give you the big picture, that they try to understand normal human beings in terms of having both a concrete, tactile, grasping attitude and an abstract visual, mental, standing back attitude.

44
00:04:11,521 --> 00:04:16,480
And in normal people, both these attitudes are fine.

45
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:28,800
And they work together by a kind of, quote, mixture, which Merle Ponty thinks is a completely inadequate way of understanding how they work together.

46
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,121
They don't really, they're not a mixture.

47
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,961
They're two aspects of this deeper thing called being in the world, according to him.

48
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,961
You can't get that by spurring together these two abstract, and I want to use that word for him.

49
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:52,160
These two modes that are aspects that Yelvin Goldstein singled out.

50
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,441
Not to say that they're wrong, he says in one place.

51
00:04:55,441 --> 00:05:03,081
It's just to say that this way of thinking about it is too abstract because it leaves out, again, I have to use the word abstract.

52
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,161
The abstract attitude is this intellectual thing.

53
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:29,240
But now, just using abstract in the normal way, by taking out these two aspects and separating them, the concrete, the abstract attitude, then they never can mix them back together again because they leave out the deep thing of which they're both aspects.

54
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:43,481
And they can't understand fully what's wrong with Schneider, since they can't understand Schneider in terms just of these two aspects without getting at the underlying thing that's wrong with Schneider.

55
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,321
Now, I'll give you the punchline now, which we should be arriving at in an hour and a half.

56
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:49,720
His intentional arc has gone limp.

57
00:05:50,521 --> 00:05:58,521
If you see what that means, you see that that's supposed to be the real meaning that explains all of his problems.

58
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:01,481
Okay, but now we have to get there bit by bit.

59
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,680
I just didn't want to lose you.

60
00:06:02,681 --> 00:06:05,160
At the bottom of 124.

61
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:18,840
On 124 and 125, we're all now in Yeld-Goldsheim, and we're looking at what they understand as the normal and how they see that in terms of these two attitudes.

62
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,480
Another way to use these two attitudes, I want to make them not seem so strange to them.

63
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:33,881
The concrete is the practical involved, and the abstract is the theoretical detached.

64
00:06:33,881 --> 00:06:41,160
That's just another, that may be more familiar way of talking about them, and more the way I talk about them.

65
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:49,040
And remember, there it is true that people can be involved and the people can be detached.

66
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,160
That's fine.

67
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:57,600
But the question is that those are two variations of something else.

68
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,001
And that's what they don't see.

69
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,160
Yeah, Richard, do you mind?

70
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,280
I mean, what I'm covering.

71
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:05,201
Yeah, don't I think we're all right.

72
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:14,561
But the way they, in history, the contrast is just between actually doing something and sort of something more like pretending to do it.

73
00:07:14,561 --> 00:07:18,720
Abstract movements, say, would be movements performed with the eyeshadow.

74
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:27,361
But precisely what the ability to perform the abstract movement consists in is being able to sort of join the second nature.

75
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,120
Just, you know, sort of salute and intellectual system.

76
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,320
Oh, absolutely.

77
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,840
That's what's all we got to pay for.

78
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,001
But there isn't no reference to that.

79
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,680
Okay, well, that would be with me for the movement.

80
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:48,801
If you don't get those pages, you see them going on and on and on, talking about the intellectualist way of viewing the problem.

81
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,720
And the intellectualist way of viewing the problem just is to try to do it all in terms of the abstract.

82
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,041
If I can think what place to refer to.

83
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:02,961
Let's just keep Aldith's comment in mind and we'll get there.

84
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:10,000
Certainly just being able to salute with your eyes shut is not normally the abstract.

85
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,881
If he calls it that, we'd have to figure out what to do about it.

86
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,161
It's the concrete.

87
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,281
Well, no, I see.

88
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:21,601
The concrete, you have to really be in your sit in a situation.

89
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,041
The abstract I see always has to do with what you can imagine.

90
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:35,561
Okay, so the patient is unable to perform abstract movements with his eyes sucks.

91
00:08:35,561 --> 00:08:38,840
Movement status, which are not relevant to any actual situation.

92
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,840
Movement doesn't make sense order.

93
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,520
But that's all theoretical.

94
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,480
That's all.

95
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:45,800
Why?

96
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:47,561
Because it's not relevant to any situation.

97
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:48,921
It's de-situated.

98
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:56,921
The essence of the theoretical way I'm using it is not to be involved in a concrete practical situation.

99
00:08:56,921 --> 00:08:57,801
So imagining things.

100
00:08:59,640 --> 00:08:59,801
What?

101
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:05,721
Because the aspect of Bunker characterized that they don't actually perform any situation as you imagine.

102
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,801
So you're not involved in a real situation.

103
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:12,521
Well, if you are involved in the situation, you're imagining you're involved in the situation.

104
00:09:12,921 --> 00:09:14,521
You're involved in an imaginary situation.

105
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,161
That's right.

106
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:15,721
All day.

107
00:09:17,081 --> 00:09:18,921
Being involved in that.

108
00:09:20,201 --> 00:09:21,641
No, throwing out into your own world.

109
00:09:21,801 --> 00:09:24,201
Yeah, it shouldn't project the world in either.

110
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:33,561
But if you're involved in an imaginary situation or imagining you're involved in a situation, that's not practical hands-on activity.

111
00:09:33,561 --> 00:09:35,481
You're not getting any feedback.

112
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,801
You're not getting any, you know, you can't fail to get a grip.

113
00:09:39,801 --> 00:09:54,921
Try to, you know, imagining getting a grip on your coffee mug or imaginary, although getting a grip on an imaginary coffee mug, it comes to the same thing, is not the same as actually getting a grip on it.

114
00:09:54,921 --> 00:09:56,601
Here's one way to say it.

115
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,321
Only this is not in here, but it might help.

116
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:03,481
I know this might help a lot, might just blur things.

117
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:25,201
In Milner and Goodale, who are these people who are the interesting ones who actually videotape people's hands when they were getting ready to go out the door and actually showed how their hand was magically at the door for as soon as they formed the intention to go out, meaning their hand began to take the shape of the doorknob as soon as they got ready to go out, which is terrific.

118
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:29,761
I also discovered something which I haven't mentioned, but it's now become very interesting.

119
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,801
You can also say, imagine that you're just getting up and going out the door.

120
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,201
What do you think happens to their hand then?

121
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,920
Well, it's hard to just picture.

122
00:10:39,921 --> 00:10:49,761
But it takes a sort of a door shape, but not an actually concretely relevant door shape.

123
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,281
That's very interesting.

124
00:10:51,281 --> 00:11:00,401
That shows that the attitude of imagining going out the door is not like going out the door or getting ready to grip an imaginary cup.

125
00:11:00,401 --> 00:11:09,681
Your hand will sort of get somewhere, but if it's getting ready to grip your coffee cup and drink your coffee, it has to get exactly right to get where the handle is and everything.

126
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:10,961
That's different.

127
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,961
And now, we'll have to rethink.

128
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,481
Yeah, one last problem.

129
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:21,201
I think that Schneider's problem is that he cannot perform abstract movements without picking up.

130
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,001
It's not the definition of abstract movements that requires him to get theoretical sense.

131
00:11:26,081 --> 00:11:27,201
There isn't real contrast, though.

132
00:11:27,201 --> 00:11:28,961
I'm not questioning the contrast to draw it.

133
00:11:28,961 --> 00:11:34,961
But the concrete abstract is a contrast between two different kinds of anomalous experience.

134
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,961
He has a great number of different abstracts.

135
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:38,641
Snyder tends to do the abstract.

136
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,961
Snyder really can't do either one of the lines.

137
00:11:40,961 --> 00:11:43,041
That's why it's so hard to follow.

138
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,440
He can't, he does have a certain abstract, a very weird abstract.

139
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:58,681
Remember, he has to do as if he was a computer, figure out where his arm is and where his head is and bring his arm in relation to his head when he's imagining the mood.

140
00:11:56,401 --> 00:12:01,561
But that by the terms, he's not just seems to me.

141
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,201
That is all given as evidence that he's unable to do his abstract movement.

142
00:12:06,201 --> 00:12:10,441
He does this weird flux and both are right.

143
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,641
I think.

144
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:19,881
When he both have this peculiar character, that's what I want to talk about.

145
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,761
There's a sort of a right way to do abstract and what normal people do.

146
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:35,081
And then there's Schneider version of it, which is somehow a broken down, distorted version of it, so that he has to find his hand and find his head and bring his hand in an objective place to his head.

147
00:12:35,081 --> 00:12:40,681
That's abstract, all right, but it's not the way people imagine that the solutions.

148
00:12:40,921 --> 00:12:43,801
And he has to figure out analogies, whatever.

149
00:12:43,801 --> 00:12:49,001
When he behaves like a computer, he's certainly not in the concrete attitude.

150
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,601
And he's certainly not in the normal abstract attitude because he's not normal.

151
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,880
But I think he's in the abnormal abstract attitude.

152
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,521
But maybe that's not the way they talk about it.

153
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:01,321
Let's look.

154
00:13:01,641 --> 00:13:01,961
Yeah.

155
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:04,201
Yeah, and this is kind of a point Ola mention last week.

156
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:12,360
I think it's certainly important to pay attention to how, at least when Grailton Goldskin talked about it, it spent about obstructing how to movement.

157
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,840
And I think bringing in attitudes is complicated.

158
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,241
I did find a path where he doesn't talk about that.

159
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:17,721
Yeah.

160
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,241
It's not till later on.

161
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,721
So I'm not sure what the relation is.

162
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,520
Easy.

163
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:28,600
What you make in the concrete attitude are concrete movements, and what you make in the abstract attitude are abstract movements.

164
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,041
I don't see any big deal.

165
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,201
Well, I think it might be a big deal.

166
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:35,081
Well, then tell me how, or maybe we don't know yet.

167
00:13:35,401 --> 00:13:35,961
Keep an eye open.

168
00:13:36,201 --> 00:13:46,240
Okay, well, one thing I think is that, well, when we're talking about attitudes, it's kind of well, I just give it a kind of Heideggerian take where it's like that, I mean not what's that.

169
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:48,961
I see, no, no, that would that would be giving them too much credit.

170
00:13:49,201 --> 00:13:49,681
That's right.

171
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:51,281
That's what I'm afraid of, yeah.

172
00:13:51,281 --> 00:13:52,081
I see.

173
00:13:52,401 --> 00:13:53,520
Well, keep your eyes open.

174
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,321
I'm pretty sure that concrete and abstract attitude are their terms.

175
00:13:58,321 --> 00:14:00,561
And we have to just get used to that.

176
00:14:00,561 --> 00:14:02,161
Well, no, movement is the one that's.

177
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,521
Well, so is attitude, no?

178
00:14:04,161 --> 00:14:04,640
I don't see it.

179
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:07,281
You said you found it about one place.

180
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:09,201
Well, but it's their term.

181
00:14:09,201 --> 00:14:12,961
I mean, Nikki, the fact that it's their term, and that it's not.

182
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,241
I don't know whose term it is.

183
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,201
I mean, it might just be more little scientific, but I guess I want to go back to the previous point in this page.

184
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:29,601
There is this important distinction of abstract movements that make with his eyes open versus abstract movements with which he cannot make with his eyes closed.

185
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,840
So, I mean, that's, I feel like that's the important distinction to get it clear.

186
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,121
Why is that important?

187
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,441
I don't know.

188
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:38,081
Well, one thing that's how the problem is introduced.

189
00:14:38,081 --> 00:14:46,480
And so, if you want to know what striders can and can do, we want to really try to do the abstract movement with his eyes open in a very weird important way.

190
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,041
Can do the abstract movement with the vital.

191
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,401
Well, that's tied up with the role of the visual in it, which has got some very important thing.

192
00:14:54,401 --> 00:15:03,681
The visual, insofar as he's got a little bit of vision, which isn't much, he has more of the abstract way of being able to cope.

193
00:15:03,681 --> 00:15:05,921
I'm trying to find a word that's different than abstract movement.

194
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,561
What you want is a word for abstract behavior.

195
00:15:08,561 --> 00:15:09,520
I mean, who cares?

196
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,120
Movement is too specific.

197
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,961
Maybe if you don't like attitude, let's get it.

198
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,201
Right, but what's the word that Galvin Geltengoldstein are using, but we want to know what's wrong with that way of thinking, but it's not a problem.

199
00:15:18,401 --> 00:15:20,561
Well, I'll settle for movement.

200
00:15:20,561 --> 00:15:22,161
I'm our comportnite.

201
00:15:22,161 --> 00:15:24,561
Anyway, he has, what was I just saying?

202
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:34,360
He has the abstract comportment, and vision helps him out insofar.

203
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:40,281
And that's why you get all this discussion of the relation of abstract movement to vision.

204
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:45,321
And he doesn't have much vision, and he doesn't have much abstract movement either.

205
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:51,000
But if vision does help him, he can't do it at all without thinking what he's doing.

206
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,321
Yeah.

207
00:15:59,321 --> 00:16:02,760
The language also does critique of their view.

208
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:14,120
Also that it's too cognitive, that it's absolutely another clue.

209
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,561
He thinks that they do it in terms of consciousness or else mechanical.

210
00:16:19,961 --> 00:16:30,201
That's when he gets, I will get to that, when he starts putting it in Sartrean forms, that they think that it's either physiological, that everybody's behavior.

211
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,120
It isn't just Schneider.

212
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:58,280
That's their basic understanding, but Schneider has it in a they think, I understand it, everybody's behavior is misunderstood if you think that it's either physiological and mechanical or that it's mental and computational, roughly, or intellectually.

213
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:03,800
Those are the wrong ways of thinking about the way people behave.

214
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:18,000
And when he's talking about the wrong ways, he'll use terms like the in-itself, which is the empiricist mechanical understanding of movement in faith.

215
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:26,240
And then he'll call the other one, when he'll use for itself, which is Sarkrian terminology, for the conscious part.

216
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,560
And those are clues that it's not his view he's giving.

217
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,601
It's not even Geld and Goldstein at their best.

218
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:54,400
But he's saying that, well, really, because Geld and Goldstein separate the abstract and the concrete movement and don't see how they're commonly grounded in being in the world, you can push their view to the extreme where it really becomes the physiological versus the mental.

219
00:17:54,401 --> 00:17:56,880
And that just shows that it's wrong.

220
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:03,201
And because it does so, it can't get near what's wrong with Schneider.

221
00:18:03,201 --> 00:18:06,240
Because I'll just keep repeating this, but it helps to know where you're heading.

222
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,280
Schneider's got something wrong with being in the world.

223
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:13,761
He has funny words for it's leveled, it's limp, it's weak.

224
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:21,760
So whatever it is, it's not something wrong with their abstract movement or their concrete movement, although it expresses itself that way.

225
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,921
There's a deeper something wrong.

226
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,601
Yeah, Olivia.

227
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:39,600
Well, Mario says that you thought that the moment is open to those verbal and imaginary situations which you can choose for himself, and we don't need to get it to give him rewards to come to you.

228
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,281
Oh, that's just a pun on situations, I think.

229
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:45,361
I don't see what you're saying there.

230
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:50,560
The important thing is he's open to something real and imaginary.

231
00:18:50,800 --> 00:19:04,201
If you want to use the word situation, both for being in a situation which is coping and being in a situation in which you're just staring at something without doing anything or have anything at stake, call them both situations if you want.

232
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:11,240
But the important thing is there are two ways of doing things, being involved and being detached.

233
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:16,921
And you're making that joke, it seems to me, to say, well, being in detached is a situation too.

234
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:17,480
Yeah.

235
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,400
But then there are two kinds of situations: being involved and being detached.

236
00:19:21,401 --> 00:19:23,560
And you have to re just rese the whole thing.

237
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,560
But nothing is added, is it?

238
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:30,121
I think being an aspect of two doesn't mean that you're detached.

239
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,760
Is there why you shouldn't be in the theory of it?

240
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,201
You don't.

241
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,881
You don't either.

242
00:19:35,881 --> 00:19:37,401
Well, tell me why not.

243
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:55,320
Because I I well, it's like I think this thing of somebody making an abstract movement without actually being going into a situation with all these comments in your head, being in the world, how you must have that confidence the door be situated with being situated having a concept that others.

244
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,280
You have to be situated.

245
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,880
I want you to have an abstract movement going for the door.

246
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:07,161
Well, minimally situated, you have to find where your arm is and where your head is.

247
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:17,800
Your body is an un your your your body is just a blob and your directedness is very uh what?

248
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,001
Well, and you remember what happens.

249
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:35,640
Your directedness is either sort of totally mechanical, in which you just go to the door in a completely involved way, or it's so uh unsituated that uh well, oh what?

250
00:20:35,641 --> 00:20:41,880
Or you can't get to the door what what what does he have to do to go out the door if you want?

251
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:49,040
If he isn't involved, he has to, when you tell him, don't go out the door, just go up to the door and stop.

252
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,321
That's what he can't do.

253
00:20:51,441 --> 00:20:52,321
That's clear.

254
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,081
But let me just say, why can't he?

255
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,800
Try to get the, keep your eye on the phenomenon.

256
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,280
We'll go to the vocabulary later.

257
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,720
What is it that he can't do about doors?

258
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:10,080
He can certainly march right out the door if you tell him to, as long as he's in the situation as, let's say, now it's time to go home.

259
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:17,760
And he can go into his own house too, remember, if he's trying to go to his house, but he walks right by and doesn't recognize his house if he's not.

260
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,201
That is, then when he's in the concrete situation, he's just like an ant.

261
00:21:21,201 --> 00:21:25,921
He's totally involved, and he has no other options and can't stand that.

262
00:21:25,921 --> 00:21:28,081
That's what it is to go out the door for him.

263
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,361
What's so funny is that you can tell him, well, just go up to the door but not out of it.

264
00:21:33,361 --> 00:21:34,880
And he can't do it.

265
00:21:34,881 --> 00:21:35,840
Why?

266
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:47,600
Well, because if you're going to go out the door, your hand has to start taking the form, and your body has to start taking the shape that it's going to need when you get there and go out.

267
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:54,481
If you tell him you're going to go to the door, but you're not really going to go out, then his hand and body can't take the right shape and he can't go.

268
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,400
He can't do it, as I understand it.

269
00:21:56,401 --> 00:21:57,840
But first him, then I'll go.

270
00:21:57,921 --> 00:21:58,480
Okay, go ahead.

271
00:22:01,201 --> 00:22:06,560
Concrete wants to be part of the very highest involved in an imaginary situation.

272
00:22:09,841 --> 00:22:10,240
Right.

273
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:17,201
But signers and concrete situations has been willing to participate in the experiment.

274
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:24,320
So these con like when he's trying to perform a concrete task, we're still kind of messed up because of the intentional artist messed up.

275
00:22:24,321 --> 00:22:26,961
So he's going to do all these preparatory movement and stuff like that.

276
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:36,281
When it comes to the abstract situation Oh, he can, in his peculiar way, he can figure out that something's a triangle by feeling that it's got three sides.

277
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:41,961
He can figure out that it's a metaphor by saying, well, it's the hearing and seeing is done by sense organs.

278
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:43,560
That's why it's a metaphor.

279
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,080
He can do abstract stuff.

280
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:57,961
It's just very, uh very peculiarly unrelated to any feel for how you normally involve in dealing at triangles or metaphors, I think.

281
00:22:57,961 --> 00:23:26,361
Well, you have to do the abstract you have to bring it into a concrete situation, like you have to actually phrase like the triangle or something like that, and then do like, oh, the triangle has no like like when um he was describing how the uh subtract and you all have didn't have the concept of numbers, like five plus four minus four, they said, well, five remains, but they didn't understand the plus four minus four, like the abstract concept right there.

282
00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:33,640
Like because numbers were just a sequence of things that just count in the moment in the concrete situation, but he couldn't like abstract them.

283
00:23:33,961 --> 00:23:38,760
And I think that's because the intentional art is not and he can't doesn't have the background.

284
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,601
Yes, that's always because of that.

285
00:23:40,601 --> 00:23:44,760
But all we're just all we're discussing, I keep thinking, is our terminology.

286
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:56,360
Are you going to say that he hasn't got any abstract attitude because he can't do these things, or his abstract attitude is sort of utterly minimal and computer-like?

287
00:23:56,361 --> 00:24:02,760
It's like saying, does he have a concrete attitude if he can go out the door, but he can't go toward the door and stop.

288
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,921
I would say in both cases, maybe I'm all off on this and I'll learn a lot.

289
00:24:06,921 --> 00:24:15,601
In both, if he has some kind of pathetic parody of the abstract and some kind of pathetic animal-like parody of the concrete.

290
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:22,161
It isn't as if he doesn't have them, he can make these wallets, but he has them in ways that normal people don't.

291
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:25,280
And the question is sort of what's missing.

292
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:32,000
And Gelb and Goldstein really say, I think, listen, we'll pay attention to this, what's missing is the right mix of the two.

293
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:41,760
There's a footnote where he catches Geld talking about we need the proper mixture of the abstract and the concrete, and Schneider doesn't have it.

294
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,600
But of course, and immediately, Merolopante says, surely that's not going to explain the weird.

295
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,401
And then he catches Geld saying in another meeting, well, I was wrong about that.

296
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:53,520
I shouldn't have said mixture.

297
00:24:53,841 --> 00:25:01,120
But the problem is they don't have anything else to say because they don't have this fundamental thing of which those two are aspects.

298
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,840
Okay, Topi and then Faldom.

299
00:25:03,841 --> 00:25:04,240
Yeah.

300
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,401
That's all I did.

301
00:25:06,961 --> 00:25:14,560
How in both cases, in the abstract is a concrete, situation, but in the abstract case, this is an anti-reading situation.

302
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:24,080
And we think the point he's going to make is that if Golden, if he's a normal person, you can have abstract things that they both have the other word, but in different ways.

303
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:30,640
So they both retire like situations, but one of them creates.

304
00:25:30,881 --> 00:25:32,001
For normal people.

305
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,040
Yes.

306
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,921
I guess I'm just, I know, only worried about the word situation.

307
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:47,921
I'll give him the word situation, but then we need a new word for what I was calling the concrete situation where you're involved in actually doing something.

308
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:56,600
Call that situation A and another situation where you're not involved in concretely coping and doing something.

309
00:25:56,601 --> 00:25:59,161
You're imagining things and so forth.

310
00:25:56,161 --> 00:26:02,441
If you want to call that a situation, call it situation I, the imagining.

311
00:26:02,681 --> 00:26:04,600
It's just a question of words.

312
00:26:04,601 --> 00:26:07,240
They're just two different things you can do.

313
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:21,560
You can cope in an involved way, or you can cope in a way which is not animal-like, not grounded in some task that is going on.

314
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,840
Well, task is ambiguous.

315
00:26:22,841 --> 00:26:23,961
They're all ambiguous.

316
00:26:23,961 --> 00:26:26,760
But the phenomenon isn't ambiguous.

317
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,640
It's clear enough that there are two kinds of tasks, as well as two kinds of situations.

318
00:26:32,681 --> 00:26:33,081
What?

319
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,120
And you're coping to.

320
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,801
And there are two kinds of cope.

321
00:26:37,401 --> 00:26:39,401
So don't worry about the vocabulary.

322
00:26:39,401 --> 00:26:40,601
Worry about the phenomena.

323
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:47,560
But what matters, what matters is that what we're dealing with in tasks is not a two-way argumentation of the phenomenon.

324
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,441
There's three different phenomena, all of which are on the plan.

325
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:55,720
And you don't want to get caught up in the vocabulary, but I think it's important to see that there are three different tell me the three.

326
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:03,160
Well, the three are the first is worldistic behavior, which is concrete.

327
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,040
That's it.

328
00:27:04,201 --> 00:27:07,001
That's what he calls centripetal.

329
00:27:07,161 --> 00:27:07,961
Use that term.

330
00:27:08,121 --> 00:27:11,000
Yes, it's coming from world in.

331
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,961
That's right.

332
00:27:11,961 --> 00:27:20,921
And then there is centriputal, which is where the background is thrown at the soul and page 143.

333
00:27:21,161 --> 00:27:22,681
The background is thrown out.

334
00:27:22,681 --> 00:27:23,560
You're imagining.

335
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:23,961
Right.

336
00:27:23,961 --> 00:27:25,240
And that's abstract.

337
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:25,641
Right.

338
00:27:25,961 --> 00:27:33,240
Both of those are forms of normal behavior.

339
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,360
Both of those are forms of situated behavior.

340
00:27:36,361 --> 00:27:38,840
Both of those are forms of lived experience.

341
00:27:39,161 --> 00:27:39,800
Those are two.

342
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,761
And then there's a third contrast.

343
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:48,161
Even though there is a difference between the dwarfs listening to me and my imagining the presence of the door, those are different.

344
00:27:48,881 --> 00:28:01,361
But the third contrast is where I must use my intellect and my vision to find my arm, flex my muscle, and go through the motions that my mind tells me I would perform if I were engaged.

345
00:28:01,361 --> 00:28:07,921
And he writes me, you know, the all three on 827, when he first describes a situation where I'm ringing to a friend.

346
00:28:07,921 --> 00:28:08,161
Yeah.

347
00:28:08,161 --> 00:28:09,441
Oh, yeah, I'm going to have your pain.

348
00:28:10,161 --> 00:28:47,201
Then he says, if I then execute, quote, the same movement, but without any presence, that is to say, not in confidence in the frame, or even imaginary partner in my mind, that is to say, it's not in my abstract situation, but treated as a set of movements and steps, if I perform a flexion of the forearm in relation to my upper arm, with the combination of matter, a flexion of the fibers, my body, which a moment ago was the vehicle of the movement, both in the abstract and in the concrete case, now becomes its own energy.

349
00:28:47,441 --> 00:28:54,240
Its motif function is no longer going to be called someone in the world, but towards my body itself, towards my forehead or arm.

350
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,560
And so that's the third class.

351
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,560
So there's these new distinctions.

352
00:28:58,881 --> 00:29:03,121
Well, it seems to me that only two of them play a big role.

353
00:29:03,121 --> 00:29:05,520
I mean, that third thing doesn't come around.

354
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:17,841
And Prince White is saying, you know, continuously, on the novel, every event, factor or whatever events ranges, predictions, uh, conventions, the growth, probability as virtual action centers, towards.

355
00:29:17,401 --> 00:29:25,600
So, the body itself, or towards the object or these two sides are parts of the leader and is really.

356
00:29:25,601 --> 00:29:28,520
And the third thing of sort of scary and searching the world is.

357
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:33,400
That may be true, but that's just still in a more local manner.

358
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:40,361
Because what's extinct is whether he wants to understand the contrast here, between a theoretical past attitude and an engagement attitude.

359
00:29:40,441 --> 00:29:47,161
The point is, this is evidence of what a truly detached attitude would look like, but it's not what he's calling the abstract attitude.

360
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:51,160
That's right, because maybe they're both abstract.

361
00:29:51,161 --> 00:29:53,640
I don't give an it's a kind of parody of the normal attitude.

362
00:29:56,681 --> 00:29:58,441
Good, good, but let's do that.

363
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:03,000
It's as if he had, let's say that for the Heideggerians.

364
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:11,001
It's as if the concrete attitude is ready to hand is dealing with things ready to hand, and the abstract attitude is dealing with things present at hand.

365
00:30:12,201 --> 00:30:13,480
Sometimes ready to handle something.

366
00:30:13,641 --> 00:30:16,040
No, no, they have no present at hand in the abstract.

367
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:27,641
I think his point was that there can be an abstract attitude where you've already looked at something that is present of hand and really articulating your body to do something in a very present-of-hand way.

368
00:30:27,641 --> 00:30:30,281
That's the abstract attitude that's not coping.

369
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:35,400
But there is an abstract attitude that is coping, that a normal person, you know, develops.

370
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:47,000
Like, if I was my original point before was if I was going to go open that door and had an abstract attitude towards it, um, I wouldn't actually calculate when the harm goes and look at it in my having to go right at it.

371
00:30:47,000 --> 00:31:03,921
I would just do it with my head and that's this abstract attitude that't the actual wait wait wait wait man if you just want to go out the door, that's not the abstract attitude.

372
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,280
Oh, big three minutes.

373
00:31:09,641 --> 00:31:12,961
If you imagine going out the door, you're in the present at hand business.

374
00:31:12,961 --> 00:31:21,761
Well, my point was that usually when I imagine the moment right now, I'm not calculating looking at that door handle, even in my imagination.

375
00:31:22,161 --> 00:31:24,880
I'm just kind of doing it to my imagination.

376
00:31:25,201 --> 00:31:31,681
Yeah, so I mean, it's hard to know what that third thing is, I guess, in Heideggerian terms.

377
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,601
I don't even know.

378
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,720
Excuse me, Boston.

379
00:31:34,961 --> 00:31:38,320
If you imagine going out the door, you have to do Heideggerian terms.

380
00:31:38,641 --> 00:31:41,840
Are you looking at the door as a present-at-hand thing?

381
00:31:41,841 --> 00:31:45,041
Or are you weird?

382
00:31:45,441 --> 00:31:46,001
I don't know.

383
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,561
I don't know.

384
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,201
Do you know?

385
00:31:48,401 --> 00:31:50,560
I think sometimes I've never done it before.

386
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:55,760
I've just learned that, yeah, I've actually got to look at the thing in a present-hand way.

387
00:31:55,921 --> 00:32:04,961
I've already done it here, and then I have this memory of it, but I still don't have that open attitude, so I've got to actually look at the present at hand, even though it's actually going out the door.

388
00:32:05,201 --> 00:32:08,880
But I mean, I think there's two ways of having this abstract attitude.

389
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,160
Well, I'm completely agree.

390
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,760
There's all of the important ones.

391
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,961
I would review that.

392
00:32:14,961 --> 00:32:32,640
There is, if you want to do it in Heidegger and quick, there is the ready-to-hand and the present-at-hand, and then, of course, there is transcendence, being in the world, openness, which with both of those modes of intentionality, that's what they're called now, and not attitude and not motion.

393
00:32:32,641 --> 00:32:44,641
The ready-to-hand kind of intentionality, the present-hand kind of intentionality, presupposes being in the world, which is not itself a kind of intentionality, Heidegger says, but the condition for the other two.

394
00:32:44,641 --> 00:32:47,841
That's exactly what Marlowe Punty has thought.

395
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:52,720
Like Heidegger, he calls it existence sometimes, and sometimes he calls it things in the word.

396
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,921
Those are synonymous for him and for Heidegger.

397
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,080
Yeah.

398
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,080
You're going to say that?

399
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,761
Oh, with this one passage.

400
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,360
Any quote?

401
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:13,000
There is this quote, which is sort of funny quote, where he does it with, I mean, we might as well look at it, where he introduces, here we are, on page 140.

402
00:33:13,961 --> 00:33:16,840
It's got Husserl in it, but it doesn't matter.

403
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,800
Husserl's been credited with this distinction.

404
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,880
Well, at least we have to read what he's talking about.

405
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:24,441
There's one of these punchlines on 140.

406
00:33:24,441 --> 00:33:34,521
The distinction between concrete and abstract movement, between Greyfen and Seigen, comes down to the distinction between the physiological and the Tsaigig.

407
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,601
This is not his view.

408
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,240
Existence in itself and existing for itself.

409
00:33:39,241 --> 00:33:40,520
That's wrong.

410
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:45,961
That's what happens if you push Geld and Goldstein with their mixture to the limit.

411
00:33:45,961 --> 00:33:47,320
And then there's the footnote.

412
00:33:47,321 --> 00:33:51,320
Husserl's often been credited with this distinction, which is a bad distinction.

413
00:33:51,401 --> 00:33:53,800
In fact, it is found in Descartes and Kant.

414
00:33:53,801 --> 00:33:55,801
It's bad wherever you find it.

415
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:59,720
In our opinion, Husserl's originality lies beyond the notion of intentionality.

416
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:08,920
I mean, if you don't giving him credit for this distinction, which is what Sartre would do, by the way, it's Sartre, too, who has the for-itself in itself distinction.

417
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,520
That's not important.

418
00:34:11,881 --> 00:34:25,560
If Husserl's got anything right, it's to be found in the elaboration of his notion of the discovery beneath the intentionality of representations of deeper intentionality, which he's always claiming Husserl's got, which I'm not going to do as Husserl's got.

419
00:34:25,721 --> 00:34:29,480
But anyway, what others, and this is the funny part, have called existence.

420
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,441
Who's the others?

421
00:34:30,441 --> 00:34:31,801
That's Heidegger.

422
00:34:31,801 --> 00:34:33,641
That's the deeper thing.

423
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,040
It probably shouldn't be called deeper intentionality.

424
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,640
At least Heidegger won't call it that.

425
00:34:37,721 --> 00:34:38,840
But it doesn't matter.

426
00:34:38,841 --> 00:34:45,201
It's what, it's this deeper thing that makes the two normal kinds of intentionality possible.

427
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:53,201
And giving a little, the next footnote sort of gives away where he is.

428
00:34:53,841 --> 00:35:07,280
It says Galvin Goldstein never named the third term between the psychic and the physiological, between the for itself and the in itself, to which their analysis always led them, and which we call existence.

429
00:35:07,281 --> 00:35:10,640
So now he's taken over the Heidegger term.

430
00:35:10,801 --> 00:35:12,000
It's very confusing.

431
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:14,161
That's why I want you to look at this quote.

432
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:20,081
It's unfortunate that there's just two different meanings of existence right next to each other.

433
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:34,641
There's existence for itself and existence in itself, which is the Tharkean, Cartesianized, Husserlian understanding of the two modes of being.

434
00:35:35,281 --> 00:35:45,681
And then there is existence the way Heidegger uses it, which is neither of them, neither in itself nor for itself, but something deeper which makes them possible.

435
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,000
And unfortunately, that's also called existence.

436
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:49,520
I can't do anything about it.

437
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,401
Everybody's claiming the word existence, except maybe not Husserl.

438
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,640
I think only Thark.

439
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:07,201
Thark, just to get a you have to understand just for a minute that the way things develop is absolutely peculiar in the history of continental philosophy at this point.

440
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:21,121
Husserl has his view, which is, I think, basically Cartesian, basically for itself, in itself's talk, and representation, intentionality, transcendental consciousness, and so forth.

441
00:36:21,361 --> 00:36:30,921
Heidegger reacts against that, develops his whole notion of being in the world and existence as more basic than any kind of intentionality.

442
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:53,000
And then the funny thing is, Sartre comes around, and being French and unable to think outside of Descartes, at least in those days, Cartesianizes Heidegger, turns it back into consciousness and objects in itself, for itself, and links up with Husserl.

443
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,520
So that Sartre can be thought of as sort of existentialized Husserl.

444
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:00,041
And Husserl thought, and Husserl, no.

445
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,441
There's one other peculiar twist.

446
00:37:02,441 --> 00:37:06,841
The Husserl thought that Heidegger was existentialized Husserl, but never mind that.

447
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:13,160
The main thing is that you see what Husserl looks like when put in existential terms, you look at Sartre.

448
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,040
Then he got it partly by actually listening to Husserl.

449
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:26,520
Then he got it in part by trying to sort of state what Heidegger's saying, but state it in a way that a Cartesian could understand it.

450
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:32,201
And the crucial thing to pay attention to is whether consciousness plays a crucial role or not.

451
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,361
In Husserl and Sartre, consciousness plays an absolutely crucial role.

452
00:37:36,361 --> 00:37:41,881
Whether it's active or passive, it's always constituting, it's always synthesizing.

453
00:37:41,881 --> 00:37:45,961
And in Heidegger, consciousness doesn't even appear in Demon Terms.

454
00:37:45,961 --> 00:37:51,640
And it's not a question of actively or passively synthesizing.

455
00:37:52,441 --> 00:37:55,561
It's this whole issue of opening up the world.

456
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,121
Yeah.

457
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,880
The other question.

458
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,240
If I just follow my notes, we'll get there.

459
00:38:01,241 --> 00:38:03,081
I'm going to go to following my notes.

460
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:10,201
And maybe we will also discover the answer to some of this difficult terminological trouble we're having.

461
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:19,441
I mean, as far as I'm concerned, if we keep our, if we can agree on the phenomena, the vocabulary can fall where it may, but I'm not sure we're agreeing on the phenomena.

462
00:38:19,441 --> 00:38:24,081
But let's start at the bottom of 124, which is where Alva picked it up.

463
00:38:25,361 --> 00:38:41,361
At least we can say that the normal subject can immediately come to grips with his body, enjoys, let's see, enjoys the use of his body, not only insofar as it is involved in a concrete setting, given situation, not only in relation to the tasks imposed by a particular job.

464
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:44,561
He is not open merely to real situations.

465
00:38:44,801 --> 00:38:49,601
I don't think that's what got us into this discussion.

466
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,800
And that's true.

467
00:38:51,281 --> 00:38:58,480
So, but the normal person is also involved, and it's very important in the concrete setting.

468
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:06,000
And he also has this other use of his body, which I don't think makes much difference here.

469
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,760
But over and above all this, his body is correlated with pure stimuli devoid of any practical bearing.

470
00:39:11,761 --> 00:39:20,081
He is open to the verbal and imaginary situations which he can choose for himself or which may be suggested to him in the course of an experiment.

471
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:34,241
Well, roughly, anyway, that's Gelden Goldstein's distinction between involved, I think, and abstract, though I see that there are two different ways that he has his body.

472
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:39,361
I don't think it's going to turn out to be important, but we will see.

473
00:39:39,361 --> 00:39:43,361
On 125, there's more about the normal about 59.

474
00:39:43,441 --> 00:39:51,121
And in the case of the normal subject, the body is available not only in real situations into which it's drawn, it can turn aside from the world.

475
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:54,321
You see, let me just gloss it the way I understand it.

476
00:39:54,321 --> 00:39:59,161
The real situations into which the body is drawn is what I call involved.

477
00:39:56,801 --> 00:40:04,040
And I was calling situations, but let's call them real situations.

478
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,361
Hooray, we've got a vocabulary now.

479
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:14,041
Real situations means a situation in which you're really doing something, you're not just imagining it, you're coping actually.

480
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:18,200
So you could be involved in a real situation, and then you're drawn into it.

481
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:18,841
We know all that.

482
00:40:18,841 --> 00:40:21,321
That's the affordance talk.

483
00:40:21,321 --> 00:40:23,321
It can turn aside from the world.

484
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:29,721
I call that as a disengaged attitude, of which theory would be a part.

485
00:40:29,721 --> 00:40:31,881
But let's call it turning aside from the world.

486
00:40:31,881 --> 00:40:35,720
Notice he does it, and that's called, he doesn't call out a situation here.

487
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:38,121
If you did, you'd have to call it an unreal situation.

488
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:48,040
He can turn aside from the world, apply its activity to stimuli, which affect its sensory surfaces, lend itself to experimentation, and generally speaking, take a place in the realm of the potential.

489
00:40:48,361 --> 00:40:49,720
And that's fine.

490
00:40:49,721 --> 00:40:51,720
That's what I think of disengage.

491
00:40:51,721 --> 00:40:58,281
It is because of the confinement within the actual, that an unsound sense of touch calls for special movements and so forth.

492
00:40:58,281 --> 00:41:16,201
Now, Niger is, in a certain way, confined within the actual, though only partly, because he also has this sort of weird, computer-like way of trying to make sense of the world when he isn't in the actual, but it's pretty pathetic.

493
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:24,200
And just as his confinement in the actual is pretty pathetic, because whenever he's confined in the actual, there is not on the horizon any other attribute.

494
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,360
That's what I mean, that he's behaving like an animal.

495
00:41:26,361 --> 00:41:30,041
He's locked into wallet-making or going home.

496
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,401
Remember this funny example.

497
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:36,601
If he's going home, then his house is going to whistle to him and call him and draw him in when he goes by.

498
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:43,520
But if he's not going home, he won't even recognize his house when he goes by because he doesn't have on the bargin of whatever project he has.

499
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:58,161
Let's suppose if he's not going home, he's walking home with Gurvich, then that's his project to go to Gurvich's house, then his house won't even solicit him because it's not on the margin of his current involvement.

500
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,321
Okay, so that's what's happening here.

501
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:04,721
So now let's see, Don Larry's Morgan, all of this is important.

502
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,321
So there's his body.

503
00:42:08,321 --> 00:42:10,720
I'm skipping a little to the left side of the page.

504
00:42:10,801 --> 00:42:13,520
Body dependent on actual situations.

505
00:42:14,401 --> 00:42:17,441
I'm going to begin that kind of long sentence.

506
00:42:17,441 --> 00:42:31,600
For a key, for instance, to appear as such, you might have experienced the kind of bullet per touch that requires Taspa field and global impressions may be coordinated into a shape, just as notes, mere stepping stones, are stepping stones in a melody.

507
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,480
By the way, this is all Gut Gestalt talking anyway.

508
00:42:34,721 --> 00:42:37,441
This is Gal Colstein talking.

509
00:42:37,441 --> 00:42:46,720
And when Narrow finds he is, no, but he is trying to do what he always does, so get the best out of them, but show how they've missed something important.

510
00:42:46,721 --> 00:42:50,160
So now he's getting the best out of them in the button.

511
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:57,201
So very viscosity of Haspile data, which makes the body dependent upon actual situations.

512
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,841
That's Schneider anyway.

513
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:10,321
Reduces the object to a collection of successive characteristics, perception to an abstract account, recognition to a rational synthesis.

514
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:12,881
See, these are things that he can do.

515
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:28,600
Now, whether you want to call the abstract account and the rational synthesis abstract attitude or not, I think depends on whether you mean normal, which it isn't, or what's left of the abstract attitude in Schneider, because Schneider can do it.

516
00:43:26,881 --> 00:43:30,760
But it's just worth nice and rhetoric, you know.

517
00:43:31,321 --> 00:43:36,520
Or just maybe there's been slightly as the confinement to the concrete, that's what he really means.

518
00:43:36,841 --> 00:43:41,240
And the symptoms are the confinement to the concrete is negative.

519
00:43:41,401 --> 00:43:45,720
It's not an identification of the abstract with the rational synthesis.

520
00:43:45,721 --> 00:43:54,200
It's precisely because he lacks a normal abstract note of the modules that he's forced to use rational synthesis.

521
00:43:54,361 --> 00:44:00,520
But that isn't, surely it's not out of confinement as a concrete that we can perform.

522
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:04,921
It does give you this abstract account that he sounds that locks him around.

523
00:44:04,921 --> 00:44:05,640
This is what he said.

524
00:44:05,961 --> 00:44:07,400
Well, where does he take it?

525
00:44:07,401 --> 00:44:16,281
He does it above the middle of the page because he's confined to the concrete and actual, and he has an unsound sense of touch.

526
00:44:16,281 --> 00:44:18,361
And then he goes to the key.

527
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:27,480
And in the key, the body is dependent on the actual situations.

528
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:44,441
But it looks, oh yeah, and in the concrete, when he tries to deal with the key, all he gets is a bunch of isolated tactile impressions, which he then has to put together in a kind of rational synthesis and say, I guess after feeling it a while, this is a key.

529
00:44:44,761 --> 00:44:46,200
Okay, now let's see what else.

530
00:44:46,200 --> 00:45:00,601
Whereas the normal person, every event related to movement or sense of touch causes consciousness to put up a host of intentions, which run from the body as the center of potential action, either toward the body itself or toward the object.

531
00:45:00,921 --> 00:45:12,480
Well, we all agree that kind of what Schneider doesn't have, whenever he's written anything involved or detached, he can.

532
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:21,681
He doesn't have any other intentions but the thing that he sort of stuck in.

533
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:30,801
Either he's stuck in isolated fragments like tactile impressions, or he's stuck in some job like making your own wallet.

534
00:45:30,801 --> 00:45:41,681
And nothing, he laps all of this other intentions, hold of other intentions that normal people.

535
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:48,560
By the way, it's so hard to follow this because notice he's doing Gel Goldstein, Gestald's talk.

536
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:57,760
He wouldn't say consciousness puts up a host of intentions that run from the body as the center of potential action toward the body itself.

537
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:03,040
That's much too necessarily sarcarian in Trump's project language.

538
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:06,561
It puts too much activity on the side of consciousness.

539
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:16,400
But he would say, not consciousness sprouts out a host of intentions, but that the body responds to a host of solicitations.

540
00:46:16,401 --> 00:46:20,161
That even Gel Goldstein will sometimes say that.

541
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:28,401
But at this point, it sounds, whenever you see the word consciousness, I would be willing to bet, though I could go wrong and mislead you.

542
00:46:28,401 --> 00:46:30,640
It's never going to be Merloponte.

543
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:35,041
It's going to be the Gail Goldstein view in these pages.

544
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,400
And that's what he's saying here.

545
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,200
So he's giving you their view at the bottom of that paragraph.

546
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:49,601
Now, the normal person reckons with the possible, which thus, without shifting from its position of the possible, requires a sort of actuality.

547
00:46:49,921 --> 00:46:51,000
I don't know what that means.

548
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,640
That's a question line.

549
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,000
Do you understand that?

550
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,561
The normal person replies, well, ah, this is it?

551
00:46:58,921 --> 00:47:00,680
Possibilities, provided it's possible.

552
00:46:56,801 --> 00:47:01,801
It doesn't even normalize that.

553
00:47:03,881 --> 00:47:08,361
Although, if it is, then it's no, it can't be for him.

554
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:12,920
At least the back of the house is never possible, but actual, if you know the house.

555
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,600
The normal person recognizes.

556
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,961
I don't know what that means.

557
00:47:16,441 --> 00:47:17,401
I really don't.

558
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:18,600
Let's try the next sentence.

559
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:26,921
In the patient's case, however, the field of actuality is limited to what is metrics in the shape of a real contact or related to these data by explicit process of deduction.

560
00:47:26,921 --> 00:47:28,120
Well, there you get the two.

561
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:33,961
Real contact is the broken down version of the gauge actual.

562
00:47:33,961 --> 00:47:43,000
And putting it together by a process of deduction is Snyder's broken down version of the abstract rational.

563
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,560
And people have nothing in between.

564
00:47:46,761 --> 00:47:52,361
I don't claim to have understood that very well, although I don't think I've betrayed it either.

565
00:47:54,441 --> 00:48:00,921
So they think Snyder has an impoverished concrete because he lacks the abstract.

566
00:48:00,921 --> 00:48:05,161
That's what I think what I've just been reading say.

567
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:14,600
That if he didn't have all this possibility, if he couldn't also bring in an abstract account, he couldn't do what he's doing.

568
00:48:14,921 --> 00:48:19,161
I'm going to go fast over this because I'm going to get to the end and you used a lot of time.

569
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:24,600
So they don't see what's missing in Schneider that normal people have, which is the body schema.

570
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,761
They don't have that way of putting it.

571
00:48:26,761 --> 00:48:34,041
They see Schneider lacks motor intentionality, which is an openness to other situations.

572
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,601
They see this on 126.

573
00:48:36,921 --> 00:48:38,120
This is what they say.

574
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:41,921
What he lacks is neither motility nor thought.

575
00:48:41,921 --> 00:48:44,641
And we are brought, oh, this is the amazing point.

576
00:48:41,401 --> 00:48:46,640
I've got to go through this probably.

577
00:48:46,881 --> 00:48:51,841
This is really hard because they get so close to getting it right at this point.

578
00:48:51,841 --> 00:48:54,240
And it sounds almost like Meryl-Ponte.

579
00:48:54,241 --> 00:48:55,280
He's owned you.

580
00:48:55,281 --> 00:48:57,040
But it's not Meryl of Funti's own view.

581
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,080
I don't know what to make of it, but I'll read it and try to tell you what I think.

582
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:11,361
What Schneider lacks, and this is got to be, I take it, speaking in the name of Gail Goldstein, all the footnotes of Gel Goldstein, the whole context, is neither motility nor thought.

583
00:49:11,361 --> 00:49:28,081
We are brought to the recognition of something between movement as a third-person process and thought as a representation of movement, something that there's an anticipation of, arrival at the objective, and ensured by the body itself as a motor power, a motor project, motor intentionality.

584
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:36,080
And that's to say that Gestaltists normally already recognize responding to a force.

585
00:49:36,401 --> 00:49:48,721
That is, they normally don't think that it's all the projects of consciousness that direct our movements, that our movement can be responding to the solicitation of things.

586
00:49:48,721 --> 00:49:55,120
So, and the Schneider lacks that, it looks like, though, I can't believe it because I would have thought that's what he had.

587
00:49:55,441 --> 00:49:56,240
So let's go on.

588
00:49:56,241 --> 00:50:02,480
The patient either conceives the ideal formula of the movement, or else he launches his body and blind attempts to perform it.

589
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:08,080
Whereas to the normal person, every movement is indissoluly movement and consciousness of movement.

590
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,080
See, that's a bad way to put it.

591
00:50:10,241 --> 00:50:18,240
Mixture of the physiological, mechanical on the one hand, and the mental on the other.

592
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:23,280
That's what they see within motor intentionality is.

593
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,760
I guess I'm trying to think this through.

594
00:50:25,761 --> 00:50:39,000
It looks like they have the phenomenon of motor intentionality, but they don't have a way to express it except by saying that it's a mixture of movement and consciousness.

595
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,240
But they've got, and I think that's right.

596
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:50,121
I think that's the, remember, I said the criticism of the Gestalt people is always that they've got the phenomena right, but they've got the wrong way of describing it.

597
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,201
And that's what he's saying here.

598
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,961
And now comes in the background.

599
00:50:53,961 --> 00:50:56,920
They've got a notion of background, but it's not his background.

600
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,401
So let's look at it.

601
00:50:59,721 --> 00:51:07,241
This can be expressed by saying that for the normal person, every movement has a background, and that the movement and its background are moments of a unique totality.

602
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:14,441
The background to the movement is not a representation associated with it, but it's input in the movement, inspiring and sustaining it at every moment.

603
00:51:14,441 --> 00:51:16,761
That's good Gestalt thinking.

604
00:51:16,761 --> 00:51:23,641
The plunge into action is to the subject's point of view, an original way of relating itself to the object, and is on the same footing as perception.

605
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,601
Okay.

606
00:51:24,921 --> 00:51:29,400
Light has thus thrown on the distinction between abstract and concrete movement.

607
00:51:29,401 --> 00:51:37,640
The background in concrete movement is the world as given, whereas the background to abstract thought is built up.

608
00:51:37,721 --> 00:51:51,801
So there's top-down background and there's bottom-up background, and it's certain that Nero Hunting says, remember his notion of background is supposed to be deeper than and take account of both kinds of backgrounds.

609
00:51:51,801 --> 00:51:54,361
I read that quote last time.

610
00:51:54,361 --> 00:52:04,601
So they're ready to say that when you're concretely engaged, you do it, you have motor intentionality on a back of it.

611
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:14,800
And when you're abstractly thinking, you have mental stuff going on on a mental sort of background.

612
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:26,161
What they can't say is that all of this is always in a bigger background, namely the organism trying to get an optimal grip on the world.

613
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:32,000
That's not even in there as a candidate, and that's what's missing for them, I think.

614
00:52:32,241 --> 00:52:37,441
So then comes the motion to the friend and the journal, can we done that with those sorts of systems?

615
00:52:37,761 --> 00:52:38,641
Okay.

616
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,920
Let me see where I am and what I can skip.

617
00:52:42,401 --> 00:52:44,080
I think so.

618
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,000
There are two backgrounds.

619
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,361
And that's as near as the Giacaltis can get to getting it right, I think.

620
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,680
I want to read now on 129.

621
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,800
By the way, there's more background talk on 120.

622
00:52:57,761 --> 00:53:03,760
There's a kind that doesn't take place in the realm of being of the actualist, the middle of 128.

623
00:53:03,761 --> 00:53:09,441
The latter, on the other hand, the virtual, that's what the abstract deals with.

624
00:53:09,441 --> 00:53:11,280
The first adheres to a given background.

625
00:53:11,281 --> 00:53:13,200
The second throws out its own background.

626
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:19,121
See, these are not the background that Heidegger and Merlot want to talk about.

627
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,961
So let me say that.

628
00:53:20,961 --> 00:53:24,801
So now on 129, about five lines.

629
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:36,000
The reason is that all the operations require the same ability to mark out boundaries and directions in a given world, sort of where we're talking about lots of things that he's listed.

630
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,441
I hope you don't go back and get them.

631
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:53,441
Established lines of force to keep perspectives and view in the world, to organize the given world in accordance with the projects of the present moment, to build into the geographical setting of behavioral ones, a system of meanings outwardly expressive of the subject's internal activity.

632
00:53:53,441 --> 00:53:57,480
There, we're clearly not in Merlot-Ponte-Haydeck.

633
00:53:57,721 --> 00:54:09,561
But the idea of the subject's internal activity getting expressed outward, the whole conceptual framework of inner and outer is something Merillo-Ponte and Heidegger both are not.

634
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:18,921
In Heidegger the phrase is, you know, Gaussian is the world grispingly, and I just read you a similar phrase in Merillo-Ponte, that we are perceiving we are the world.

635
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:23,881
So this inner-outer talk is clearly something you won't buy.

636
00:54:23,881 --> 00:54:33,320
For the patient, the world exists only as one ready-made in Kijio, whereas the normal person, his projects polarize the world, and he magically gets to view.

637
00:54:33,321 --> 00:54:37,721
I used to think this was a perfect statement of Merilo-Ponte's position.

638
00:54:37,721 --> 00:54:39,480
Now I think it can't be.

639
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,961
For one thing, it's in Miguel Goldstein's section.

640
00:54:41,961 --> 00:54:49,080
The two, projecting, remember, is always, I think, too Sartrean, too, non-Eigen, too Heideggerian.

641
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,401
It starts kind of understanding of Heidegger.

642
00:54:51,401 --> 00:54:57,961
It's an active, never mind what projection is in Heidegger, Persar is this kind of activity.

643
00:54:58,361 --> 00:55:06,040
Bringing magically a host of signs which guide action as notices in a museum guide the visit.

644
00:55:06,361 --> 00:55:09,400
See that's that's fine, but that's sort of off.

645
00:55:09,401 --> 00:55:19,401
It isn't that the subject projects a meaning which then gives things in the world significance.

646
00:55:19,401 --> 00:55:25,321
It's that things in the world just have significance and draw actions out of you.

647
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:32,601
So the function of projection or summoning in the sense of meeting summons out in the person is also what makes abstract movement.

648
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,880
I guess, I mean, it's that's why I say this is hard.

649
00:55:35,881 --> 00:55:39,081
And I may be wrong, and I'm reading it differently than I used to.

650
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:42,161
I used to think there's Merleoponchi stating this view.

651
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:46,320
But I want to say now that three things suggest that's wrong.

652
00:55:41,801 --> 00:55:48,560
And I'm saying it, and then you can figure it out on your own.

653
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:51,601
One, the footnotes are all together with Goldstein.

654
00:55:51,841 --> 00:55:55,361
He's explaining their view of Schneider.

655
00:55:55,361 --> 00:56:06,401
And he's using the vocabulary, projection, subject, consciousness, which is not the kind of his vocabulary, I think.

656
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:06,881
Yeah.

657
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,080
Yeah, I think you're right.

658
00:56:08,881 --> 00:56:13,361
In rereading this, I've only used the terms geographical setting and a behavioral one.

659
00:56:13,441 --> 00:56:14,801
And that's gestalt psychology.

660
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,120
That's exactly what he thinks is wrong there.

661
00:56:18,321 --> 00:56:19,840
So they'll say a little more about that.

662
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:26,880
So the geographical setting would be, I guess, what we could call the objective world and corresponds to objective space.

663
00:56:26,881 --> 00:56:31,040
So the gestalt psychologist would think that there's the real objective space that's out there.

664
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,760
And we're, you know, in the sense perceptions.

665
00:56:33,761 --> 00:56:41,601
Well, and the behavioral setting or the behavioral environment is kind of the virtual or phenomenal one, but not the real one.

666
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,520
It's the one we project onto that.

667
00:56:43,761 --> 00:56:44,560
That's the clue.

668
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:44,720
Right.

669
00:56:44,881 --> 00:56:50,400
So the reason why this is important is because, you know, this chapter is on the spatiality of one's own body and motility.

670
00:56:50,401 --> 00:56:57,600
And it's these two kinds of spaces that we need to get clear on the objective world space, you know, in this paper and with our lives with another.

671
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,280
And that's the kind of space that we need to.

672
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:06,800
Okay, there's not a projection of the mind or subject or consciousness, I think the Gestaltists would have said.

673
00:57:06,801 --> 00:57:13,841
It's not a projection of consciousness on to this physical geographical space.

674
00:57:13,841 --> 00:57:21,200
It's the lived world, the real bottom line, which will call forth the appropriate action from us.

675
00:57:21,841 --> 00:57:23,040
The objective view.

676
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,520
That's the richness.

677
00:57:25,761 --> 00:57:33,560
It's interesting, though, I mean, I always get tripped up because the Gestaltas have the phenomena right of the world calling forth the action from us.

678
00:57:33,961 --> 00:57:36,921
They think it's all exactly.

679
00:57:36,921 --> 00:57:43,160
They got keep saying this, the Gestaltas have the phenomena right, but they have the conceptualization of it wrong.

680
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:48,441
They've only got the categories of conscious and physical world.

681
00:57:48,441 --> 00:57:51,000
They've got for itself and in itself, maybe.

682
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:51,800
I don't know about that.

683
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:52,601
Do they?

684
00:57:52,841 --> 00:57:54,280
I don't know whether they use those terms.

685
00:57:54,281 --> 00:57:56,280
I doubt that they're just disguised.

686
00:57:56,761 --> 00:57:58,921
They come up with their own terms like geographical.

687
00:58:00,841 --> 00:58:08,201
Okay, but it it it certainly seems always to be the right phenomena described in the wrong way.

688
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,921
That's what I think this whole chapter is going to go on about.

689
00:58:10,921 --> 00:58:12,120
Ooh, fifteen minutes.

690
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:12,280
Yeah.

691
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:16,680
Well, you mentioned Stars in that paragraph drawing book 29.

692
00:58:16,761 --> 00:58:23,880
But when you put it off the paragraph, it talks about more of the requirements and an aspect of it, of the projection.

693
00:58:24,361 --> 00:58:27,560
So is he basically saying that even the critical projection?

694
00:58:27,801 --> 00:58:31,000
There's an ethical ethical.

695
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,760
This is just utterly unethical.

696
00:58:33,241 --> 00:58:34,040
Why would you say that?

697
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:38,440
But come and tell me in office hours or after class, because we're so far from anything ethical.

698
00:58:38,441 --> 00:58:39,640
I just don't know.

699
00:58:39,801 --> 00:58:47,961
Well, these critical projections, if you're saying it's right, projection is the wrong category for understanding how meaning gets in the world.

700
00:58:47,961 --> 00:58:49,560
Let me put it when they're in the museum.

701
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:54,041
The mind does not put meaning in the world like putting signs in a museum.

702
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,320
Meaning is in the world.

703
00:58:55,321 --> 00:59:00,921
Meaning is as in the world as you can get in a Heidegger in the world.

704
00:59:00,921 --> 00:59:07,401
I mean, if you were asking where did the meaning get put into the physical universe, then you could say, well, maybe consciousness put it there.

705
00:59:07,401 --> 00:59:08,921
Who knows how it got there?

706
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:10,760
In fact, well, never mind.

707
00:59:10,761 --> 00:59:18,961
But if you're talking about the world in which people live and act, they don't go around projecting onto this world meanings.

708
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:19,681
Yeah.

709
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,040
This is what the book is.

710
00:59:24,881 --> 00:59:25,360
Really?

711
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:26,321
Tell me, where?

712
00:59:26,961 --> 00:59:31,280
It's around 100 CPI content from this point.

713
00:59:31,361 --> 00:59:42,240
I think the intentional artist says, rather, that the massive consciousness is underlined by intentional art that projects around us all that.

714
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,361
Anchor screen.

715
00:59:43,361 --> 00:59:43,760
Wow.

716
00:59:43,921 --> 00:59:45,360
Let me tell people where that is.

717
00:59:45,361 --> 00:59:49,361
This is on page 157 for us.

718
00:59:49,361 --> 00:59:51,601
But I was going to get to that and read that.

719
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:52,480
Oh, is it?

720
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:53,040
Yes.

721
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,720
That's interesting.

722
00:59:54,801 --> 00:59:56,000
Very interesting.

723
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:56,480
Okay.

724
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:57,680
That's a tough one.

725
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,120
I don't know what to say about that.

726
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:01,280
I'll have to go back to the drawing board.

727
01:00:01,281 --> 01:00:03,281
But I don't like it.

728
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,480
And let me think of this, Lee.

729
01:00:06,801 --> 01:00:12,000
See, I think what, well, let's get the phenomena right first.

730
01:00:12,321 --> 01:00:21,520
Okay, the phenomena is that the more we learn about the world from experience, the more and what we learn shows up in the world for us.

731
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:33,121
So that you talk meralte like a city which once you had to figure out, now it looks like this is the way to the grocery store and this is the way to the bank and it and the streets look like that.

732
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:40,881
So that the intentional art is the way experience feeds back into the world so that you don't need a representation of the world in your mind.

733
01:00:42,881 --> 01:00:43,841
Well that's that's the question.

734
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,040
But the question is, are we projecting meaning onto the world?

735
01:00:47,361 --> 01:00:48,720
And that's what we're not doing.

736
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:59,320
But here in this passage, there is a this other kind of temporal projection which inherently our sensitivity for receiving the meaning as well.

737
01:00:56,401 --> 01:01:02,200
Let me say it by way that that's exactly right, Rick cited.

738
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:05,080
It's very helpful, and I don't think you disagree with this.

739
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:15,720
It's the difference is between a blank world that has no meaning, on which consciousness projects meaning, and the intentional arc, which is what I was trying to describe, the phenomenon.

740
01:01:15,721 --> 01:01:22,681
The world is already full of meaning, but as I get more and more experience, the world gets more and more meaning.

741
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:34,520
And I I'm sorry he calls that projection, but at least it isn't the kind of projection that Sark talks about where it's influenced by either direction.

742
01:01:34,761 --> 01:01:35,160
Right.

743
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:47,000
Okay, but it's wrong to call it projection because projection really sounds like when it's normally used by these people, all meaning comes from us and is put on the world.

744
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:55,480
And we agree, in this passage, projection means as I have experience, my world acquires more and more meaning.

745
01:01:55,480 --> 01:02:00,600
And it's true, this experience that it has meaning, and so the meaning is that there before your experience is.

746
01:02:00,921 --> 01:02:05,240
That's true, but it's so subtle, but it's so different, fundamental.

747
01:02:05,241 --> 01:02:06,200
Consider again.

748
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:13,000
It's like this blank world in which consciousness puts up these signposts that tell you where to turn in the coil.

749
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:13,961
Let's take the city.

750
01:02:13,961 --> 01:02:15,080
It's a funny difference.

751
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:18,120
It's as if the city were just the sort of geographical setting.

752
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:19,881
It had these buildings and streets.

753
01:02:19,881 --> 01:02:22,201
And then consciousness projects on that.

754
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:26,361
Turn right here to go to the grocery, turn left here to go to the cleaners.

755
01:02:26,361 --> 01:02:29,000
And that's that's close.

756
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,881
That's the way Sartre thinks about it, I think.

757
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:47,280
Now, but what Merrill-Ponty thinks is, well, it's true when I come to the city, this already has a lot of meaning, but as I cope with it, it gets more and more, and this street comes to look like the way to the cleaners and the way to the soul.

758
01:02:41,801 --> 01:03:05,841
And now, the only difference is, instead of saying consciousness projects onto the city that meaning, what he says is the lived body, in coping with the city, gets a richer and richer experience of the city.

759
01:03:05,841 --> 01:03:08,000
And that's called the intentional arc.

760
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,441
Now, are we disagreeing about that?

761
01:03:09,441 --> 01:03:10,720
I'm just trying to get the distinction.

762
01:03:10,961 --> 01:03:20,161
I don't think we disagree, but I think the important thing to bear in mind is that there's a third round between consciousness and pure mechanistic approach.

763
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:24,240
But still, there's a discrepancy between the body and the consciousness.

764
01:03:24,241 --> 01:03:26,720
The body is here before the consciousness.

765
01:03:26,801 --> 01:03:29,280
You're not conscious, that's your body.

766
01:03:29,281 --> 01:03:29,841
The lived body.

767
01:03:30,721 --> 01:03:35,361
The feedback is being guided by the consciousness.

768
01:03:35,361 --> 01:03:44,240
So the consciousness thinks that the significance, the meaning, are in the world in an almost objective way, because they're here because the body is in the world.

769
01:03:44,241 --> 01:03:50,560
Just like the consciousness doesn't understand, cannot grasp the fact that the body is in the world before consciousness.

770
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,120
I see what you mean.

771
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:57,600
I mean, what he's saying is it's from the that's what Sartre is missing, in other words.

772
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:29,881
If you don't have a sense that the lived body outside of consciousness can be responding to meanings and feeding meanings back into the world, which is what we'll do what the intentional arc is, then you have to think that you have consciousness gave meanings to this meaningless world, which is what Bart does think, and Kant, I mean, all intellectualists think it, because any intellectual sees that the world is full of meaning and they wonder where it came from, and it couldn't have just come from the physical world, so the mind must have put it there.

773
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:31,480
That's the mistake.

774
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:36,041
But they proved that something put it there, meaning the body put it there.

775
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:43,081
And that's, and now the only problem is that it'd be unfortunate to use the word projection for both of these, but he did.

776
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,160
And so now we've got, and now, Eric, yeah.

777
01:04:48,281 --> 01:04:48,760
Oh, really?

778
01:04:49,881 --> 01:04:50,280
Really?

779
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:51,240
Where's that?

780
01:04:51,881 --> 01:04:53,321
The bulk area of this movement.

781
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:54,200
Really, really.

782
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,000
Well, show me, show me.

783
01:04:55,321 --> 01:04:56,601
I'm delighted.

784
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:57,801
Why does he use it?

785
01:04:58,841 --> 01:04:59,560
I'm lost yet.

786
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:00,120
I'm not expecting it.

787
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:01,160
Which page?

788
01:05:01,241 --> 01:05:02,361
Yeah, the same page.

789
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:04,040
Which page?

790
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,721
157 of this.

791
01:05:07,721 --> 01:05:08,361
What do you want?

792
01:05:08,361 --> 01:05:09,561
You get the old one.

793
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:10,280
No, no, no.

794
01:05:10,921 --> 01:05:12,120
This one was very sick.

795
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,200
136 and the other one?

796
01:05:14,761 --> 01:05:17,240
But I still don't see it, and I think it's so funny.

797
01:05:18,441 --> 01:05:19,321
Okay, searchlight.

798
01:05:19,401 --> 01:05:19,720
Thanks.

799
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:21,160
Virtual.

800
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:22,120
Where's searchlight?

801
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:22,600
Oh, yeah.

802
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:23,160
Okay.

803
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,680
Searchlight is inadequate.

804
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,441
Is that projection?

805
01:05:26,921 --> 01:05:28,520
In French, it's polyclon.

806
01:05:30,841 --> 01:05:31,401
Interesting.

807
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:33,320
Well, it's sort of a joke.

808
01:05:33,321 --> 01:05:34,761
But okay.

809
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,040
The idea that phenomena is the same.

810
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:44,921
I mean, it's something, the searchlight has the light in it, and it puts it onto the objects which are intrinsically dark.

811
01:05:44,921 --> 01:05:50,441
That's the SARC language, the for itself, gives all the meaning to the in-itself.

812
01:05:50,441 --> 01:05:59,321
And Gel Goldstein, it's the, what do you call it, gives the meaning to the geographical what do they call the other thing?

813
01:06:00,841 --> 01:06:01,480
Okay.

814
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:03,401
So, uh, okay, but good.

815
01:06:03,401 --> 01:06:05,000
We've got something here anyway.

816
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,281
So now let's read it again, because it's a very important quote.

817
01:06:08,281 --> 01:06:11,721
And then it's sort of summing up what what we've just been saying.

818
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:19,360
The life of consciousness, cognitive life, the life of desire, perpetual life, all of that.

819
01:06:21,361 --> 01:06:22,160
Perceptual view.

820
01:06:22,241 --> 01:06:23,040
Yeah, what did I say?

821
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:23,600
Perpetual life.

822
01:06:24,961 --> 01:06:25,600
Very funny.

823
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:34,000
Okay, perceptual life is suspended by an intentional arc which projects around about us.

824
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:43,441
And that's, now you have to understand that to me, always already has projected and goes on projecting, put it in the Heidegger chart.

825
01:06:43,441 --> 01:07:01,441
Always already projects and goes on projecting around us our past, our future, our human being, our physical and ideological and moral situation, or rather, which results in our being situated in all these respects, situated in this engaged sense of situation.

826
01:07:01,441 --> 01:07:13,601
It is this intentional arc which brings about the unity of the senses, of intelligence, of sensibility, and motility, and it's this which goes limp in illness, that is, in Schneider, particularly, in this case.

827
01:07:13,841 --> 01:07:18,401
Do we, let me see, as I said all this, let me say it again, it's so important.

828
01:07:18,721 --> 01:07:20,081
You see what he's doing?

829
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:48,721
He's saying the whole view that somehow either the whole world, that we have a representation of the world, and as we learn more and more about the world, we update our mental representations, which is the cognitive view, or that we have this conscious capacity to project meanings onto the world, which is the psychoanalytical or psychosomething psycho psychological view.

830
01:07:48,961 --> 01:07:53,440
I don't know who to attribute it to, besides Sart, but it's certainly not just Sartre's view.

831
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,600
I mean, it's a big view.

832
01:07:55,601 --> 01:07:57,480
That neither of those views is right.

833
01:07:56,881 --> 01:08:03,560
We neither have a mental representation of the world nor do we project the meanings onto the world.

834
01:08:03,881 --> 01:08:11,080
The world is, this I put in my computer book way back, the best representation of itself.

835
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:15,400
You don't need a copy of it and you don't need to give it meaning from scratch.

836
01:08:15,801 --> 01:08:24,680
The world is always already there and giving you a whole lot of meanings and guidance and gets more and more the better you get at dealing with things.

837
01:08:24,681 --> 01:08:28,600
That's just a brilliantly right thing to say.

838
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,841
You're not looking unhappy with that, are you?

839
01:08:30,841 --> 01:08:33,240
You're looking that you look like you're unhappy.

840
01:08:33,641 --> 01:08:47,480
The problem is that I think you were saying that what I described is very likely to be reasonable, for example, but the problem is that the body has not existed at the beginning of this chapter, but it is only a part of the system of the world itself.

841
01:08:47,481 --> 01:08:50,520
And so it's like this thing designed the world existing.

842
01:08:50,521 --> 01:08:51,400
Yeah, it's this stage.

843
01:08:51,801 --> 01:08:52,120
Right.

844
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:53,160
It's this circle.

845
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,240
If people don't see this in there, I feel...

846
01:08:58,521 --> 01:09:03,640
At the very end, the remote part of the body says, well, because of the path towards the world itself.

847
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:07,320
It's always for him.

848
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:13,240
I keep saying, keep remembering that the body is responding to the solicitations of things.

849
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:15,961
Of course, things don't solicit if you don't have a body.

850
01:09:15,961 --> 01:09:21,080
But the body couldn't respond to their solicitations unless they actually had them.

851
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,240
And that's the intentional art.

852
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:24,520
That's the feedback loop.

853
01:09:24,521 --> 01:09:27,240
That's the basic story he's got.

854
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:28,760
And he doesn't give it up.

855
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:37,721
He makes it even stronger in the next book, The Visible and the Invisible, where, you see, there's certain interesting, important, general things to say.

856
01:09:37,721 --> 01:09:47,360
There is a tendency in this book for it to look sort of Kantian, meaning it looks like the body is really the source of the unity of the world.

857
01:09:41,881 --> 01:09:49,280
It's the body schema that does it.

858
01:09:49,601 --> 01:10:02,480
And then it looks too much like the body's got some kind of privilege over the meaningful world, whereas what we've just been saying about the intentional arc shows that it's totally equal, the body and the world.

859
01:10:04,481 --> 01:10:04,801
Exactly.

860
01:10:04,881 --> 01:10:06,480
But you can't talk about the bitty anymore.

861
01:10:06,641 --> 01:10:06,881
I know.

862
01:10:06,881 --> 01:10:08,400
Well, that's what I was leading up to.

863
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:26,640
In the visible and the invisible, he stops talking about the body because the body has gotten too much over to looking like a constituting subject, an entity which gives the meaning to things and has some kind of prior unity, which it objects on things.

864
01:10:27,521 --> 01:10:29,520
When he's at his best, he never says that.

865
01:10:29,521 --> 01:10:34,160
But he does sort of go in that something like using the word project and so forth.

866
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:40,640
And so when he writes his next book, which he didn't finish, he just dropped the body and talks about the flesh.

867
01:10:40,641 --> 01:10:43,440
And the flesh includes the body and the world.

868
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:47,841
It's that whole big gestalt, which he's always had his eye on.

869
01:10:47,841 --> 01:10:52,560
The big gestalt, which is bigger than us and the world.

870
01:10:52,561 --> 01:10:54,640
And so you see why.

871
01:10:54,641 --> 01:11:01,280
And then the people read the visible and the invisible, and they get it so wrong and say, well, Nero Ponte has totally changed his position.

872
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,280
He doesn't believe in the body anymore.

873
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,560
He believes in the flesh.

874
01:11:04,561 --> 01:11:06,160
Well, he hasn't changed it.

875
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:08,160
He's been true to it.

876
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:09,841
He's taken it to its limit.

877
01:11:09,841 --> 01:11:11,120
He's cleaned it up.

878
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:14,721
All you have to say is that he's cleaned up his act between this book.

879
01:11:14,721 --> 01:11:19,040
Don't let anybody tell you, though, I think it's all over the French literature as far as I can see.

880
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:23,280
Nero-Ponte made some kind of radical change, repudiated this book.

881
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,881
You read that again and again.

882
01:11:24,881 --> 01:11:25,921
It's just not so.

883
01:11:25,921 --> 01:11:30,520
I'm glad we've got Olivier here to represent the good French reading of it.

884
01:11:30,841 --> 01:11:31,160
Yeah.

885
01:11:26,721 --> 01:11:33,160
I was going to make a small point on the quote.

886
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,961
You won't want to stand up here when there is an investment on art.

887
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:40,921
If we just do the word orience after that instead of project, it would make a lot more sense.

888
01:11:40,921 --> 01:11:42,200
Well, let's try that.

889
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:44,040
Where is that projecting?

890
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,040
The light, the consciousness, the conscious light.

891
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:46,600
Oh, yeah.

892
01:11:47,481 --> 01:11:47,801
Okay.

893
01:11:47,801 --> 01:11:51,881
Which I say which projects around us, which orients us in.

894
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:56,360
Well, no, because he wants the word light to projects.

895
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:05,560
In this, don't forget that he is saying, quite sensibly, that it's because you get experience of the world.

896
01:12:05,561 --> 01:12:07,560
I mean, how do we put it?

897
01:12:07,561 --> 01:12:09,240
It's a tricky sub-think.

898
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,560
But your world looks different than my world.

899
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:19,721
The city that looks easy to get around into you looks like it's a puzzle to solve with a map to me.

900
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:25,721
So there is some sense that each of us is putting our meaning into the world.

901
01:12:25,721 --> 01:12:27,560
We don't want to deny that.

902
01:12:27,881 --> 01:12:42,280
And so each, so at one level, and that's he's got this right in sort of, there is the body projecting around all of us our physical situation.

903
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:47,320
It's projecting around all of us our basic perceptual situation.

904
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:53,240
It's projecting around us our shared moral situation, where his comment comes in.

905
01:12:53,561 --> 01:13:03,720
That is, with our general sense of who's good and bad, and what's right and wrong, and what's disgusting, and what's admirable, and so forth, which we all share.

906
01:13:03,721 --> 01:13:11,520
Because remember, sort of, it's one perceived in me, one perceived the world, one perceives all these moral qualities too.

907
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:18,560
But then there is also going to have to be my own past and future.

908
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:23,600
Besides this general human setting, I don't know whether that's going to be in here.

909
01:13:27,841 --> 01:13:29,680
The example of the friend.

910
01:13:29,681 --> 01:13:34,721
So like a friend, like my mother, you know, has a sense of whether I'm happy or sad, but you know my voice.

911
01:13:34,721 --> 01:13:35,040
Okay.

912
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:39,440
And if it's part of the friend, in fact, what I wouldn't hear, but here is this primary world.

913
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:40,400
Where do you see that?

914
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,440
Oh, yeah, the primary world.

915
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:44,480
Okay, the primary world is the one I was describing.

916
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:49,280
And its secondary meaning target out in the primary world.

917
01:13:49,280 --> 01:14:05,921
And so all I went on to this speech about is, but there is a sense in which I'm organizing, that is enriching this world and responding to maybe the better thing is to say the rich sort of thing.

918
01:14:05,921 --> 01:14:12,400
The world is already rich, but as I get more and more tuned into it, I can respond more and more to its richness.

919
01:14:12,561 --> 01:14:14,320
Let me say that again about the city.

920
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,240
You could hear a clue where it's have to stop.

921
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:26,320
You could hear that as I get more and more experienced, I project into the city more and more signposts, the bakers over here and the restaurants over there.

922
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:31,600
Or you could say, the funny thing to say, but I think it's what Mario Ponte and Heidegger think.

923
01:14:31,601 --> 01:14:34,641
There's all this rich and gibbs and things.

924
01:14:34,641 --> 01:14:36,480
There's all this richness in the world.

925
01:14:36,481 --> 01:14:37,520
There are two different views.

926
01:14:38,721 --> 01:14:45,961
Well, as you just said, I mean, I think we're looking, he has a kind of more view that Olivia was suggesting, where we're kind of finally getting meaning.

927
01:14:45,961 --> 01:14:47,721
I think that's it.

928
01:14:45,841 --> 01:14:48,360
We have another one.

929
01:14:48,641 --> 01:14:50,801
But then there is a better view where we're just getting more.

930
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,160
Keep your eyes open.

931
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:53,120
I will too.

932
01:14:53,120 --> 01:15:01,400
I mean, it does look like Mario Ponte in this book, anyway, thinks that we play a role in adding more and more meaning to the city.

933
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:10,040
It could be, you could have a weird metaphysical view, but it may be the right one, is to say all this meaning is already in the city.

934
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:13,881
The street that leads to the baker and the street that leads to the restaurant and so forth.

935
01:15:13,881 --> 01:15:22,841
And as you get more and more familiar with the city, you get more and more attuned to all the meaning and references that are already there among the objects.

936
01:15:22,841 --> 01:15:27,641
I think that that's what he would like to say, but I don't know anywhere where he says it.

937
01:15:27,641 --> 01:15:31,560
Last you look like you want to say, do you find any place where he says anything like that?

938
01:15:31,881 --> 01:15:34,040
No, you don't think it's Merloponte.

939
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:34,440
That's me.

940
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:35,320
No, that's me.

941
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:36,761
Okay.

942
01:15:36,761 --> 01:15:37,961
Well, let me.

943
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:42,921
And no one else probably were bumping around.

944
01:15:42,921 --> 01:15:45,000
We read the crucial quotes, I think.

945
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:48,440
I'll go back, and if we haven't, I'll bring them in next time.
