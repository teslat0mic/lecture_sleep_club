1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,520
We're going to go being going on to freedom, but I want to go back to temporality.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:14,160
Freedom is sort of a freebie in the sense that we don't really need it to understand the rest of the book.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:26,640
Whereas, of course, as disorganized as ever, the book should have ended with temporality and put freedom before temporality, because it keeps promising that temporality is going to be the big final aha where it all fits together.

4
00:00:26,639 --> 00:00:33,119
And then you get temporality, and then he met Gard in a cafe and they had a big fight about freedom.

5
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,119
So you get another chapter on freedom, which is a very interesting chapter.

6
00:00:37,279 --> 00:00:38,799
I definitely want to get to it today.

7
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:44,240
I think it's one of the most understandable and original of all the chapters.

8
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,119
But there's this funny situation about temporality we have to talk about first.

9
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,680
I can't decide whether it shows that I'm very smart or very stupid.

10
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:09,040
But what happened was that I complained and complained that there was no place in the temporality chapter where he talked about what he should be talking about, which is my world prior, sorry, the world prior to my world.

11
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,080
And in the same way, it should be the present prior to my presence.

12
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:21,439
There ought to be a shared present on which I am open and from a perspective.

13
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,240
And there wasn't any in that chapter.

14
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:34,639
And remember, I said therefore it's the most confused chapter I've ever seen because sort of 95% talks about my present and in the last paragraph it mentioned the present.

15
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:42,879
Well, as I say, either he's stupid or brilliant or just memory, he does talk about the present.

16
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,240
He talks about it in two very important places.

17
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,999
He talks about it, of course, not in the time chapter, that would be asking too much.

18
00:01:51,999 --> 00:02:00,679
But in the freedom chapter and in the thing in the natural world chapter, the piece of temporality that's crucial to the whole time chapter, there it is.

19
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,279
So I'm going to talk about it.

20
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:10,119
I would be so pleased that I had sort of invented it, except, of course, I read the book before, and I probably just remembered it.

21
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,799
But in any case, whatever, we've got to talk about it.

22
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:20,119
First, reminding you of the problem that we're supposed to be talking about.

23
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:30,279
That is, he's talking about on 483 in the first paragraph, which you need to think for transposing it.

24
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,559
He talks about my field of presence in the widest sense.

25
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:48,199
And you don't know what he's talking about there, but it seems to be very much mine because he goes on and talks in the paragraph about my present and my life and so forth.

26
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:59,959
And then, about two-thirds of the way down, he gets to mentioning the field of presence, just in the passing, everything causes me to revert to the field of presence as the primary experience and so forth.

27
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,879
So, and I just find it all utterly confusing.

28
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:09,000
And on four, I'm not going to go into this much, but to remind you of the problem.

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:19,639
So, on 490, he's talking about two-thirds of the way down, that one single explosion or thrust, which is subjectivity itself.

30
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,679
We must understand time as the subject and the subject as time.

31
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:27,799
Well, that all makes it come back, seemingly to me again.

32
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:48,959
And so that every, it's as if I said last time, and I still believe it, it's as if in this chapter he has one foot in Husserl, which is always about my subjectivity and my present and my time, and occasional glimpse of Heidegger, which is always about openness through the shared world and shared time.

33
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:57,439
And it doesn't, it goes on flipping mostly back and forth till the end of 503, on 503.

34
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:03,279
And then you get about halfway down that paragraph.

35
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:16,400
The two temporalities are not mutually exclusive, as our two consciousnesses, because each one knows itself by projecting itself into the present where they interleave.

36
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:31,680
So now it looks like something like there are two different temporalities, two different streams of time, in inner sense, you would have to say, that project themselves into the shared world, and there they intervene.

37
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:32,720
They interleave.

38
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,320
That's not good enough.

39
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:45,119
I mean, that still seems to give the priority to the subject, which then projects this time, and then you put together out of it a shared time.

40
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,879
That would be Husserl's view.

41
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,559
That would be Sartre's view.

42
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:51,199
That shouldn't be Merrill-Conte's view.

43
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,440
And then he gets it more together as my living present.

44
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:03,519
That's still my, opens up on a past, which I nevertheless am no longer living, and on the future I no longer live and never will.

45
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,799
My living experience, that's this streaming inner something.

46
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,120
And perhaps never will.

47
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:18,239
I can also open to the temporalities outside my living experience, inside and outside mine.

48
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:18,720
And V.

49
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:27,040
It's just crazy, and acquire and acquire a social horizon as if I could be a living, living present first, then get a horizon.

50
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:35,880
And then, and then so that you get a collective history which my private existence takes up and carries forward.

51
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:40,199
And I wrote in the margin, what happened to nature time?

52
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:54,280
And then he quickly, the solution of all problems of transcendence is to be thought in the thickness of the pre-objective present in which we find our bodily being, our social being, and the pre-existence of the world.

53
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,840
Well, that is nature time, but he doesn't say so.

54
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,479
And that's as far.

55
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,559
And so we have to go look for it.

56
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,359
Olivier helped me by saying, you messed up last time.

57
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,240
The natural time you're looking for is in the book.

58
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:12,359
And I said, I missed it.

59
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:14,840
I have to go back and read the time chapter more carefully.

60
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,080
And he said, no, it isn't in a time chapter.

61
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:19,239
That would be asking too much.

62
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:21,479
It's in the freedom chapter.

63
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:29,320
Okay, so we'll go to the freedom chapter on 525, starting really at the bottom of 424.

64
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:29,639
What?

65
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,600
524.

66
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:31,640
Sorry.

67
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,199
And now, there's a whole different story about time.

68
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,199
It's about 10 lines up.

69
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:58,440
There is therefore no occasion to ask ourselves why the thinking subject or consciousness perceives itself as a man or as an incarnate or historical subject, nor must we treat this apperception as a second order operation which somehow performs starting from its absolute existence.

70
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:01,080
Somehow, I don't know what that means.

71
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,639
And now comes this weird new thing.

72
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,119
The absolute flow.

73
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:08,439
That's going to turn out to be nature time.

74
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,119
It could have been my own most private time.

75
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:15,200
And if that's what it is in historical time time consciousness, but it isn't here.

76
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:28,320
The absolute flow takes shape beneath its own gaze as a consciousness, a man, incarnate subject, because it is a field of presence to itself, to others, and to the world.

77
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:41,919
So now it's looking like, at least what I'm going to say is, you better sort of expect him to say sooner or later, that there's going to be a field of presence, and I'm going to be a perspective on it.

78
00:07:41,919 --> 00:08:01,280
And so let's go on and because this presence throws itself into the natural and cultural world from which it arrives at an understanding of itself, we must not envisage this flux as absolute contact with oneself and density with no internal fault, but as a being which is in pursuit of itself outside.

79
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,600
Now this is getting what you want.

80
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:17,200
If the subject makes a constant and at all times peculiar choice of himself, one know why his experience always ties up with itself and presents him with objects in definite historical places.

81
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,799
So this is not his view.

82
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:26,879
We have why we have a general notion of time valid through all times, why finding the experience of etherebus links up with that of others.

83
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,919
You better not be starting to be a subject.

84
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,360
You keep talking about Sarter or Husserl there.

85
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,480
Okay.

86
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:42,880
But it is, but it is the question of itself which must be the question itself must be questioned.

87
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,000
What is the question?

88
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:56,240
How does my private, inner, subjective, temporal experience connect up with the world so that there's continuity in the world, connect up with others who are temporal?

89
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,400
That's the wrong question.

90
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,600
Well, what is given?

91
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:02,840
And now we finally get what we want.

92
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:06,760
It is not one fragment of time followed by another, one individual flux then another.

93
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:14,520
There is a taking up of each subjectivity by itself and of subjectivities by each other in the generality of a single nature.

94
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:28,439
Now, he was getting close in this intertwining of subjectivity, but now the intertwining of subjectivity doesn't seem to be what sort of you get at as second order when you find out how my subjectivity links to yours.

95
00:09:28,439 --> 00:09:30,280
No, there's something behind it all.

96
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:35,880
A general nature, the cohesion of an intersubjective life and a world.

97
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:45,080
The present mediates between the four itself and the four others, between individuality and generality.

98
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:48,600
And then skipping one sentence because he doesn't do anything there.

99
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:50,200
It just free lines from the bottom.

100
00:09:51,319 --> 00:09:54,360
I am an intersubjective field.

101
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,600
That's what you want to be.

102
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:58,520
I mean, that's what you want him to say.

103
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:01,800
That would mean I am an openness on the world.

104
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:11,240
I am an intersubjective field, not despite my body and historical situation, but on the contrary, by being this body in this situation, and through them, all the rest.

105
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:21,480
Well, it's still a little hard to get, but I take it through them meaning being a perspective on the shared nature time.

106
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:27,240
Well, if that was all we had to go on, I must say we wouldn't know for sure what to think.

107
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,919
But there is more to go on.

108
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:39,240
At the middle of 426, he talks about a little above the middle, the notion, oh, yeah, five for correcting, but I thought 526.

109
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:49,840
The notion of a generalized or natural time, he's going to say, we have seen that there is no natural time if we understand the time of things without subjectivity.

110
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,240
Remember, that's the beginning of the time chapter.

111
00:10:52,240 --> 00:11:02,799
But if you try to have a time laid out without any subjectivity, then you would just have sort of a blocked universe of, it wouldn't make any sense.

112
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,000
There'd be no temporality and no way to get into it.

113
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,840
But we don't want, there won't be no natural.

114
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,320
And that he agrees with Heidegger.

115
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:25,040
There is no natural time, if that means time without some involvement of Dasein or whatever we are in it.

116
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:50,000
Because Heidegger thinks, and I think Nero Ponty thinks, there wouldn't be any now, and there wouldn't be any earlier and later, except insofar as we bring the now into something like a universe in which without us there would just be a succession of states, that there wouldn't be any now state.

117
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:56,160
And that's what Heidegger calls the time-free movements of nature.

118
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,599
He's got a fuel about this.

119
00:11:57,599 --> 00:12:00,080
But I think Aeroponte has a similar view.

120
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:07,680
Nature by itself doesn't have temporality because it doesn't have now and earlier and later.

121
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:16,559
On the other hand, it isn't that we sort of out of our inner streaming experience constitute temporality either.

122
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:18,319
I mean, it's the usual thing.

123
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:25,280
We have to link up with our subjectivity and unlock this natural time.

124
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:31,000
And there wouldn't be any natural time until we unlocked it.

125
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,079
And when we don't make it up, we do unlock it.

126
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:42,040
We get in sync with something that's happening in nature, this usual story, this are boot-given.

127
00:12:42,040 --> 00:13:09,240
And when we get in sync with it in the right way, we then experience a natural time which is shared, when our body's human, which is impersonal and in that sense shared, gets in sync with this natural something or other, then we get a shared nature, time, of which we then all have, which we then all have perspectives on.

128
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,759
So he doesn't want the generalized notion.

129
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,880
There's no natural time if we understand the time of things without subjectivity.

130
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,720
There is, however, at least a generalized time.

131
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:23,640
That's what we're trying to understand.

132
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,240
And about 15 lines from the bottom of 526.

133
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:48,840
As long as we place an opposition with no mediator before itself and the inn itself, start and so forth, and fail to perceive between ourselves and the world this natural foreshadowing of a subjectivity, this pre-personal time which rests upon itself, acts in the sustaining the upsurge of time.

134
00:13:48,839 --> 00:14:07,240
So there is a pre-personal time which rests, which is somehow there, and then we, by getting in sync with it, make it into the upsurge of time which we experience, I guess.

135
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,440
I mean, I'm giving you the clearest passages.

136
00:14:10,439 --> 00:14:13,720
It makes it sound, just if that's any help.

137
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,560
How many have had contacts with asking and forgetting?

138
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:24,720
Well, it's as if there's something which in itself isn't temporal.

139
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:35,759
And then there's us and our way of getting in touch with it, which makes for their being a shared time.

140
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:46,240
Whoever talks about this has got to get a shared time out of it somehow, because we, as Heider says, we all say the same now.

141
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:51,520
This gets to be a mystery in personal thought.

142
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,880
And it sounded like a mystery when you talk about my presence.

143
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,359
Why is my presence going to be like the same present as your presence?

144
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:17,520
So there's got to be something in nature which is general and something in us which is general which gets together with that something in nature and produces this impersonal shared nature time.

145
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,880
And then I'm going to keep saying that's the present.

146
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,760
That nature time has a constantly shifting presence.

147
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:35,600
And it's shifting, so this unboxing thing I don't want to go back to, so that what's in the future gets nearer and nearer, and then it recedes into the past further and further.

148
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:40,640
That's the field of presence that we all open on.

149
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,000
Okay, let me see.

150
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,760
Let me just make sure I've got every quote that I can find that will help.

151
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,080
Oh, no, there's still another whole bunch of quotes.

152
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,679
So let me look.

153
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:56,560
Now we're really going to go to Did We Do Thor and He Dead.

154
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:56,999
Yeah.

155
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:10,840
Now, now for more on the subject, bring into page 385, where he talked about it already when he got to the end of the thing in the natural world.

156
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:18,120
And he talked about it, I guess, a little clearer, about six lines down in 385.

157
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:36,200
The natural world is the horizon of all horizons, the style of all possible styles, which guarantees for my experience a given, not a will unity, a given, not a will unity, underlying all the disruptions of my personal historical life.

158
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:47,000
Its counterpart within me is the given, general, and pre-personal existence of my sensory functions, in which we have discovered the definition of the body.

159
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:49,800
So there's this business again.

160
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:54,919
In me is this pre-personal something, and out there is the natural world.

161
00:16:54,919 --> 00:17:04,599
And together, they produce this shared experience of time.

162
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:11,799
At the bottom of 385, my last attempt almost to tell you what it's about.

163
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,199
No, 386.

164
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,760
Oh my gosh, that can.

165
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:19,719
My perceptual field.

166
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,079
Now, what can my perceptual field mean at this point?

167
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:28,760
Well, it's got to mean my point of view, this shared, impersonal, natural time.

168
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,199
And it looks out that way.

169
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,920
My perceptual field with its spatial horizons, I am present to my surroundings.

170
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,919
I coexist with all the other landscapes stretched out beyond it.

171
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,760
And all these perspectives together form a single temporal wave.

172
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,280
That's the unboxing and boxing thing of the world's instance.

173
00:17:47,920 --> 00:18:05,440
So my perceptual field connects me up with the temporal wave, which is this woo-shin presence that's coming through and constantly shifting at a whole thing so that the present keeps changing and taking up the future.

174
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,199
That's got to be the world.

175
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:17,119
So through my perceptual field with its temporal horizons, I'm present to my present, to all perceiving past and future.

176
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,280
Well, it isn't going to get us any more than we've already got.

177
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:35,439
But it's getting clearer, I guess, I mean, at least I hope so, that there is a my perceptual field and a my present, but it's not basic one.

178
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:41,359
It's the opening on the natural time, the general, the pre-personal.

179
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:43,040
That's got to be the basic one.

180
00:18:43,040 --> 00:19:00,799
Just keep saying to yourself, as far as I can tell, the slogan that either you're going to have my world prior to the world, then you've got SARS and first of all, or you're going to have the world prior to my world, and then you're going to get either in Verlo upon T.

181
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,280
And the same thing has got to be true of time.

182
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:16,559
So you're going to get either my stream of inner experiences as prior to a shared, objective, public, temporal world where we interweave them and constitute the shared one.

183
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:26,240
Or you're going to get an a shared, natural, general, temporal shifting field.

184
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:36,760
And then you're going to have to get some story about how my subjective perspective sort of scans that in.

185
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,280
But then it'll be the world prior to my world.

186
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:47,079
Now, there are uh there's of course and I want to say I got to be careful something.

187
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:51,799
There's no the temporal world though prior to my perspective on it.

188
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:54,920
The right thing to say is that we are open heads.

189
00:19:55,079 --> 00:20:02,599
We turn toward a fair natural temporality from a perspective.

190
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:07,240
We have our own life, our own history, and so forth.

191
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,799
And that's what he wants, that's what he should be saying.

192
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,199
I just let me just I go get two more quotes.

193
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,079
Now maybe one.

194
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:19,319
Okay, this is the final one, 387.

195
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:24,280
I just saw what I was looking for earlier and couldn't find, so let me put it in where it goes.

196
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:32,760
Remember the first thing I read to you said something in the widest sense, and I didn't know what the widest sense was, and I have question mark in the market.

197
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,319
You don't know that.

198
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,479
What's the first thing I read to you?

199
00:20:35,639 --> 00:20:38,439
That's my field of the 43, of course.

200
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,399
483, my field of the presence in the 483.

201
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:46,119
Okay, you're section 483?

202
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,960
In your book, in my book.

203
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,159
48.

204
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,360
487.

205
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,799
Oh, yeah, you're right.

206
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:54,439
Okay, you're right.

207
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,240
That's where it is.

208
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,479
Yeah.

209
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:59,720
So the top in my field of presence in the widest sense.

210
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,639
Now, what is that?

211
00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:07,079
Well, it's related to 387, the time in the widest sense.

212
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:15,839
You could sort of get them together because otherwise, that phrase, he thinks you remember that phrase, because he presumably wrote that chapter the day before he wrote this chapter.

213
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,200
We don't remember that.

214
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,159
I was looking for it.

215
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,839
I dimly remembered it.

216
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:24,479
So, because otherwise, who knows what time the lightest could be.

217
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,040
Okay, so time in the widest sense, that is the order of presence in the widest sense.

218
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,359
What?

219
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,119
Well, I mean, one of them says the field of presence in the widest sense, right?

220
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:33,919
I'm 483.

221
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,440
But I'm now on 387.

222
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,799
I think they're related.

223
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:37,920
I think they're the same.

224
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,280
Time in the widest sense.

225
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:47,760
Time in the widest sense, that is the order of coexistence as well as that of succession, is a setting to which one can gain access.

226
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,680
See, this is now this idea I want.

227
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:54,000
The public time, which we have access to from a perspective.

228
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:12,879
It's the coexistence is a setting to which one, that is, an individual, can gain access and which this individual can understand only by occupying a situation and by grasping it in its entirety through the horizons of that situation.

229
00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:34,719
So you've got a situation, your situation has horizons, and that gives you the grasp you get on the totality of this shared time, which is, I think, what he calls nature time, general time, impersonal time, and all that.

230
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,440
I think that's all I could say about it.

231
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,160
I mean, if anybody wants to say anything about it, go ahead.

232
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,839
I don't have any more to say about it.

233
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:42,559
Yeah.

234
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,480
Which book then?

235
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,679
Of the new magician.

236
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,159
The new one.

237
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,839
How you managed to make yours stay open?

238
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:48,399
What's it?

239
00:22:48,399 --> 00:22:49,199
279?

240
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,159
279.

241
00:22:50,399 --> 00:22:51,040
Okay, great.

242
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,760
Let's see.

243
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,159
Look at all.

244
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,200
The page down, it says perception is always in the vote of the impersonal one.

245
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,520
Yeah?

246
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,720
It's not a personal action, even enabling me to do a question of this to my life.

247
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:12,199
Person who, in sensory exploration, gives a past to the present and directing towards the future is not myself as an October subject, but myself insofar as I am a body and able to look.

248
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:17,319
Yeah, that's as far as that is the essence of time.

249
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:17,720
Yeah.

250
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:28,040
There would be no present, that is today, no sensible role because thickness and the gospel of richness, the perception in Hegel's words did not retain a past in the depth of the present, so that contraval.

251
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,400
That past with that depth.

252
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:33,160
So he specifically says perception is always in the vote of the impersonal one.

253
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,079
Where does he say that?

254
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:36,439
He says that in the first sentence I read.

255
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,479
Always in the motive.

256
00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:39,559
Okay, and that's temporality too.

257
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,319
It's a motive and the personal one.

258
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,319
No hope.

259
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:47,959
I'm trying to see if there's any more because this is another piece of the time story.

260
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,559
I didn't know he was around.

261
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:50,919
I'm going to put it in here.

262
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,199
Okay, so we get it also in 279.

263
00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:11,079
And does it, because I'm always hoping he'll say clearly that the way that I have a perspective on this general share of impersonal nature time, he never sort of doesn't say it, but he never denies it, but he never says it in so many words.

264
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:13,399
Okay, I put together the best I could.

265
00:24:13,399 --> 00:24:15,959
Anybody else want to say anything about it?

266
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,919
I'm ready to go on.

267
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,639
Yeah, Albert.

268
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,319
Just keep going.

269
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:28,439
Your presentation, I was puzzled about the role of the size of this is always funny, and I'd like to know if you agree with them.

270
00:24:29,879 --> 00:24:36,839
Because that one said, I was thinking about what you said earlier about the pre-personal perception of saying tree's color.

271
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:42,040
The pre-personal perception of the tree's color is not supposed to depend on users of the world.

272
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:48,159
So why should the pre-personal perception of time in anyone's kind of interception world?

273
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,319
And then, of course, the answer is that it doesn't.

274
00:24:50,319 --> 00:25:00,959
But that which is perceived, experienced pre-personally in a temporal fashion, must also be that very same thing which is accessible interpersonally.

275
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:06,960
Just as that which is perceived as the color of the tree must be available to another perspective as well.

276
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,799
That's good, that's good, that's right.

277
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:19,760
Just as the thing is always experienced from somebody's perspective or other, but it's the shared thing that we all have perspectives on.

278
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:30,000
So time is always experienced from somebody's situation or other, but it's the shared thing that we all have percept the shared time that we all have perspectives on.

279
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:30,959
That's what you're saying.

280
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:39,040
Right, but I think to be consistent, he doesn't want to be able to do that in some sense, my experience of time to anything that is other people.

281
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,440
No, did I say that?

282
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:41,839
No.

283
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,239
No language they worry.

284
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,120
That's what he was saying.

285
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,719
So I was just trying to.

286
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,159
I wasn't going to challenge it.

287
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:48,959
He's doing Steve.

288
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,479
I thought it wasn't great.

289
00:25:50,879 --> 00:25:51,040
Okay.

290
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:51,839
I thought it was my.

291
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,879
I stunned.

292
00:25:52,879 --> 00:25:53,439
Okay.

293
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:04,399
Before you said though, I was saying one thing about that just repeat in my own term, in my own words.

294
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:17,919
Yeah, just that we don't make up the shared time by interweaving the personal times any more than we make up the shared thing by interweaving the perspectives on it.

295
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:21,280
I'm just repeating the same point.

296
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:25,280
And that's why I think it's bad for him to talk about interweaving.

297
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:31,959
That makes it sound too much like that I have to construct the shared thing out of the perspective.

298
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,680
Maybe not.

299
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:37,879
But I mean, at least if anybody thinks that, he shouldn't be saying anything like that.

300
00:26:37,879 --> 00:26:38,680
Okay, now.

301
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,079
Well, he does.

302
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:44,760
I think the end of the passage sounds very worried and like that.

303
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,199
When he favorably decides Husserl and the self-constitution of your time.

304
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:52,359
He does not favorably decide against him exposively.

305
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,040
Well, let's go.

306
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,680
Where are we?

307
00:26:54,839 --> 00:27:05,399
See, in my book, there's just this passage I'm thinking of, views at the bottom of page 240, because in your book, it was involved in knowing.

308
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,679
Oh, well, maybe he.

309
00:27:15,879 --> 00:27:21,079
It will be by thinking about time, explaining how it exists only for subjectivity.

310
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:27,720
Since without the value, the past would itself be no longer featuring yourself to be not yet.

311
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,239
So being in the time.

312
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:36,440
And however, that you can study that God or refer with Husserl to a self-constitutional time.

313
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:42,040
Okay, well, I don't understand where he's writing in order to protect the tendency.

314
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,119
And they're like, well, that's that's possible.

315
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:57,559
But to begin with, a lot has got to do with the notion of subjectivity, whether there could be a shared pre-personal, non-individual, non-private kind of subjectivity.

316
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:02,359
Because he does, we don't don't think that I'm saying that you could have time without subjectivity.

317
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:05,079
Remember, he's very clear at the beginning of the time chapter.

318
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:09,799
Dependent objective, there is no such thing as purely objective time.

319
00:28:09,879 --> 00:28:11,599
So the question is, what sort of subjectivity?

320
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,639
What does he mean by subjectivity?

321
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,040
And there must be several.

322
00:28:13,639 --> 00:28:21,520
And something like my individual private subjectivity would be one possible thing.

323
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:29,359
My perspective on the world would be, I think, the right notion, one of the right notions of subjectivity.

324
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:54,399
And then this shared nature thing, which we all produce together by our shared body set to deal with things, that still got subjectivity in it, but now it's not talked about from the point of view of each individual perspective, but as a kind of co-production of human beings in nature.

325
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,200
That's the good one.

326
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:59,200
That's what I think he calls nature time.

327
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:08,799
I mean, nature time tends to be your time and my time, and it better not be something that we sort of constitute out of our individual times.

328
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:27,359
It ought to be this co-production of bodies with all of our bodies with this universal unlocking schema produced, co-produced along with whatever there is, this group being out there, nature time.

329
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,760
But it's got subjectivity in it.

330
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,559
That's right.

331
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,639
He's clear about that.

332
00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:33,679
And so is Heidegger.

333
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,799
So is Husserl.

334
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,280
The question is, what sort of subjectivity?

335
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:45,599
I think in Husserl, it's this private inner streaming kind of experience of time, which is the subjectivity.

336
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:55,760
I think in Marilo-Ponte, it's supposed to be the shared, well, that's the complicated one.

337
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:03,559
The pre-personal, general, natural time seen always from some perspective, experienced always.

338
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:08,520
All I want to keep saying, and now I'm going to stop this, is you've got to keep your eye on the phenomenon.

339
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,040
Isn't that how it is?

340
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:27,799
Don't we all experience ourselves as empty heads turned toward the present from each of us from our own experiencing of the present, from our own perspective, but it's one shared time that we all feel we open onto.

341
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:28,359
Yeah, with.

342
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:34,200
Okay, well, when I speak of the phenomenon, it seems like if we all died, the Earth would have been here way back when.

343
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,920
You know, if Earth was here before we were all born, now we died.

344
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:43,559
That things are going to keep on going, and that part of it's fine is that the plants exist in time, that they grow and that you know.

345
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,599
And it would have happened whether we were ever around or not.

346
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:48,040
Yeah, and it all just happens in time.

347
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:51,719
So that's, you know, I think the phenomenon I see advanced in nature.

348
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,159
Are you agreeing or disagreeing with Marillo-Pontino and with me?

349
00:30:55,879 --> 00:30:56,839
That means two different things.

350
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:59,160
Well, first, I'm just trying to stick to the phenomenon.

351
00:30:59,159 --> 00:30:59,400
Okay.

352
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:07,480
Second, sort of in response to something that you said of any during Berlin, you talk about like a brute eating or something like this.

353
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,000
And this is precisely why I used them as being a kind of transformer.

354
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:12,839
Oh, Scott, I thought that's what you were having.

355
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,040
That's fine.

356
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,720
Remember, that's the subject.

357
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:26,119
This will come back for sure in the last meeting where I said we could devote the whole time to what kind of idealist he is or isn't, and time will bring it, of course, all back, but not now.

358
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:27,879
Yeah, I sort of...

359
00:31:31,879 --> 00:31:32,439
Let's not talk.

360
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:42,280
I mean, I said Brood Being, which is, by the way, not a phrase from this book, but a phrase from the next book, The Visible and the Invisible, the book that he was writing and never finished.

361
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:57,119
But Broot Being is sort of always surrounding this group in the background, so to speak, because it's that whatever it is that we have to unlock in order to get a world and we have inherited.

362
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:03,440
Behind it, it helps me to think of him as a kind of evolutionary epistemologist.

363
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:11,760
I don't know if that occurs to anybody else or not, and he wouldn't like it because, of course, that would suggest being much too much of a realist.

364
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:27,359
But it does look like whatever it is and our body schema for coping with it, which is innate and which has always been in human beings and will always be not only human beings, but all higher primates.

365
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:30,799
And it works to unlock the world.

366
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,119
But you wonder why in the world do we all have this?

367
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:35,600
And why in the world does it work to unlock the world?

368
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:37,599
Well, you can't help thinking it better.

369
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,240
It's evolved to do just that.

370
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:48,879
And I don't, Merlot Ponty wouldn't say it, but if it helps you to think about it, to think about it that way, it helps me.

371
00:32:48,879 --> 00:33:14,799
I mean, that makes it so much less of a mystery that we all share, us and the primates and the pre-linguistic children and so forth, a general, impersonal body schema that enables us to perceive objects with stable properties and perceive time as pattern and so forth, get a grip on space and so forth.

372
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:20,719
All the stuff he talks about is somehow supposed to be the way nature is.

373
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:32,520
Well, I don't know what nature is before we get a grip on it, but whatever it is, that what nature is, is the sort of thing that this kind of schema can get a grip on.

374
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:37,000
And this sort of schema is there because it can get a grip on nature.

375
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,359
I don't think even Nero Ponty would want to deny that.

376
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:47,879
It's just that saying, and thank goodness and why not, and evolution, I don't think he wants to talk about that.

377
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,159
Yeah, no.

378
00:33:50,760 --> 00:34:17,000
If he said, yeah, I don't want to challenge the shared time thing, but it's just that the experience of time was the moment that I have any kind of perception on that time is when I have a mistake between my I have respect for receiving the shared schema, either when it passes very slowly or it's good.

379
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:24,759
I mean, these are the moments that I have any knowledge about the phenomenon of the market.

380
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,400
I think some of you could write an interesting paper on that.

381
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:31,239
So I wonder if Michael was kind of what it doesn't want to do.

382
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:33,079
I think that's a terrific question.

383
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:39,320
And I have an answer which I've given, I think, once or twice already, but it always looks different in different contexts.

384
00:34:39,880 --> 00:35:09,280
I think that when there's a kind of breakdown, then you have a different experience of time and you experience the inner time as your own temporal perspective which can be in or out of sync with other people's time and with nature time and it looks like that must be and this is the crucial move, the basic one, that inner stream of time, and it must look like this other one, this shared one, is some kind of construction out of it.

385
00:35:09,279 --> 00:35:11,199
That's how it certainly looks to Dart.

386
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,720
I would say that's how it certainly looks to visceral but then if Olivier were here, he would probably say no.

387
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:20,319
But in any case, and what is Mario-Ponty supposed to say to that?

388
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,760
What would I say to that?

389
00:35:21,759 --> 00:35:29,520
That's this issue about whether your experience is transformed when you have a breakdown and reflect on it.

390
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:44,559
And it's supposed to be the idea that then you experience yourself as having private experiences, as having your unique temporal inner flow and so forth.

391
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:53,919
And then the question really becomes the issue: is that the way it was when everything was going right and you were coping?

392
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,679
And then the answer is, well, no.

393
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:03,840
But then, did you discover that that was what was going on when you were supposedly all shared in this transparent coping in this shared world?

394
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:16,400
Well, as soon as you say yes, if that's a discovery of what was really going on all along, then my world is prior to the world, and my time is prior to nature time, and so forth.

395
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:29,599
So you've got to say, if you're a Mario-Ponty or a Heideggerian, that kind of reflection, which produces an ego and a self and a stream of innerness and all that, isn't a discovery, it's a production.

396
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:41,679
It's the way that shared time is transformed when you reflect on it, which is usually either doing philosophy or having a breakdown, or maybe the other thing.

397
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,120
But anyway, so then that's the deep, deep issue.

398
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:59,639
And his, and in remembering the answer to the coquetoe, he's got to say, and he does in effect, that the I think can come to uh accompany every representation, as Kant says.

399
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:07,880
But you can't read that back and say that there is an I think that's constituting and accompanying every representation anyway.

400
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,400
In fact, you've got to deny it.

401
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,839
But that's a great place to stop.

402
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,040
You have a new quote or something?

403
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:20,200
But I think Ralph Ponty would say that you experience this phenomenon of shared time whenever you run into something that's familiar.

404
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:26,119
Whenever you turn the doorknob, this is based on your path and habits of turning the doorknob.

405
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:29,559
I mean, I think that's what he means by experiencing the phenomenon of time.

406
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,359
That's not quite what I think.

407
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,960
I mean, not that I disagree with it.

408
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,319
But that happens too.

409
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,279
But no, no, no, they're going to we can't plunge back in.

410
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:40,279
I just let's stop while we're ahead.

411
00:37:40,279 --> 00:37:42,599
Or if we're not ahead, if we're going to stop anyway.

412
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,400
Well, happy reflection on the fucking paper.

413
00:37:46,759 --> 00:37:47,639
I can't say more.

414
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:51,879
And I don't want to say more, because freedom, we've got now time, very little time for freedom.

415
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,959
And it's important because it's so good.

416
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,720
It's such an interesting chapter.

417
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:58,280
You can do it sort of on your own, it's so good.

418
00:37:58,279 --> 00:38:02,839
And you can do it probably after you've written your paper, since I doubt if anybody's going to be writing their paper.

419
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,079
Anybody writing on the freedom chapter?

420
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:05,959
So, okay.

421
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,119
But still, we should talk about the freedom chapter.

422
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:13,000
To begin with, just curious, and I won't be upset if I thought if you tell, just tell me the truth.

423
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
How many have already read the freedom chapter?

424
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:22,520
Okay, the really interesting question is, how many realize that the first uh four pages are not a marvel pong tea?

425
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,480
Or did you get suckered into it, as one always does?

426
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:34,280
Okay, the first convincing four pages starting from four from five oh four to the middle of five oh seven will start.

427
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:44,400
And it's the claim that consciousness is a pure nothingness and gives whatever meaning anything has to anything.

428
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:46,960
And it therefore follows necessarily.

429
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:57,599
Tartan patrol Husserl, as having this notion of this meaning-giving consciousness, radicalizes it to pure nothingness and pure freedom.

430
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,920
and then says that whatever meaning anything has is up to the individual.

431
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:11,999
Then you get this amazingly pure kind of freedom in which you can, everything gets its significance according to you.

432
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:21,280
Therefore, there can be no causal action on you from the outside because you'll have to give to whatever has any causal effect on you, whatever meaning it has.

433
00:39:21,279 --> 00:39:44,559
I forget whether it starts here or somewhere where he talks about the people who give to their athletic activity the chance to enjoy the nature and to enjoy hard work, and the other people who think it's like him, the nerds who think that it's sweaty and unpleasant, and why would anybody ever go out and hike around in the outdoors?

434
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:58,719
And the answer is, you create a kind of outdoors which is exhilarating and good if you give it that meaning, and you create a kind of outdoors which is depressing and bad for your health if you give it that kind of meaning, and it's all up to you.

435
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:00,800
That's the first chunk.

436
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:08,240
And on 506, he's talking about that, then total freedom to give meaning to everything.

437
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:21,840
And then the next three pages, starting on 507, he rebukes Sartre by not yet by giving you his view, not at all.

438
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:25,359
He just takes Sartre to the limit and shows how crazy it is.

439
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:42,680
That starts the middle of 507, where he starts to say, if you believe Thark's view, you end up believing all sorts of crazy things, and that you can completely determine the meaning of the world for you.

440
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,440
And that goes to the bottom of 508, I think.

441
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,360
I mean, since Meryl-Ponty isn't telling us, we don't know.

442
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:57,320
But I think his view starts three lines from the bottom in the middle of the page.

443
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:59,480
We shall soon see that.

444
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,240
We as him and us.

445
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:02,839
Versus Thart.

446
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:07,160
He's now sort of taken Thark to the limit.

447
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:09,399
And now he's going to go on his version.

448
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,239
We shall soon see that we have indeed always the power to interrupt.

449
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:15,079
That's the proven start.

450
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:16,519
That's the freedom part.

451
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,680
Sartre's got a point that Merlopony never wants to take back.

452
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:23,400
That you can radically change your life.

453
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:31,960
It used to be in the little town where I come from that there would always be these alcoholics who would one day or the next would become born again Christian and completely un-alcoholic.

454
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,319
That just goes, and that's Sartrean freedom.

455
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,240
And that really exists.

456
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:45,000
But Merloponty is going to say again and again that that's always done on a background and so forth and so forth.

457
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,119
And that's sort of not the way to think about our normal kind of freedom.

458
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:54,360
So he says we shall soon see that we have indeed always the power to interrupt.

459
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:56,440
That he's never going to deny.

460
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,559
But it implies, in any case, the power to begin.

461
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:04,040
But there would be no severance unless freedom had taken up its abode somewhere.

462
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,800
I mean, you can't stop being an alcoholic unless you are an alcoholic.

463
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,640
And how did you get to be that?

464
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,000
And now freedom's taking up its abode somewhere and prepared to move it.

465
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:26,559
Unless there are cycles of behavior, open situations requiring a certain completion and capable of constituting a background to either confirmatory or transformatory decision, we never experience freedom.

466
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:32,000
So, and then he's off criticizing Sartre again, about ten lines down, as J.P.

467
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,799
Sartre himself observes, which is very funny because he almost never names Sartre.

468
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,279
He always usually says one can object.

469
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:44,399
It might be said, I don't know what game those two are playing with each other.

470
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,559
You realize this book comes out, I think, two years after being in nothingness.

471
00:42:48,559 --> 00:43:01,200
So it's just every, it's in every philosopher's mind that already what Sartre said, and this is to take it as assumed that you all know Sartre code, and Merrill LePonty is finally getting his turn.

472
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:13,120
And so the big argument in this chapter is the blurred ideas that the limit on our freedom, there's a threefold limit on our freedom.

473
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:17,520
There's the shape of my body.

474
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,399
Well, maybe there's four if you want to cut it off then.

475
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,559
The shape and size and power of my body limits my freedom.

476
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:37,840
The way my perceptual system works, my own past as a sedimented background, and I think the most interesting part is about the power of the background.

477
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:42,480
My own past as a sedimented background limits my freedom.

478
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:50,760
And my own past as the history of my, he's got my class that you could say, my culture.

479
00:43:51,159 --> 00:44:01,720
Let's just say that they're all this, I mean, being a Westerner, being an American, being in the working class, but all this shared stuff limits my freedom.

480
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:07,480
And in most of the cases, we're free also to break out of it.

481
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,040
But we can't break out of the first two.

482
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:13,480
So I ought to make a distinction, which I haven't in my notes.

483
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:18,040
The first two are the body-determined ones, literally bodies.

484
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:31,240
Certain mountains are going to be impossible to climb, he says, and certain passes you can get through, and certain passes you can't, because you've got a body of a certain size, and you've only got a certain amount of energy, and so forth.

485
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:32,999
That's not something you can fix.

486
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:46,280
And this wonderful example, Anthony Carpenter on the bottom of 5'11, you know, the way your perceptual system works is not something that your freedom can explode or totally transform or even mess with.

487
00:44:46,279 --> 00:44:48,440
And those are those dots at the bottom.

488
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,440
The Gestalt figures is the way the visual system works.

489
00:44:52,440 --> 00:45:03,319
And all the freedom in the world, you can't make those dots group any other way than in those set of seven or whatever it is fixed, I guess, fixed, group.

490
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:14,120
That's a wonderful, elegant, just brilliant refutation of Sartre because you ought to be able to just freely give them the meaning two sets of three groups.

491
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:17,480
I mean, I mean, yes, you could group them.

492
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:25,400
You could group them, you know, you could, in theory, you could move them around any way you want, group them any way you want, but your visual system won't.

493
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:32,919
And that's, so there are two body ones, the size and shape of your body and the way your perceptual system works.

494
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:39,640
And then there are two background ones, your personal history and the personal history of your culture.

495
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:45,840
Those aren't up for grabs in freedom, in the way that Sartre thinks.

496
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:49,679
Okay, now we can look at that in detail because it's all me.

497
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:55,120
So, what's the point here?

498
00:45:55,279 --> 00:46:02,079
Starts at the bottom of 507, about the middle of 507, the start of his own critique.

499
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:08,400
And that's where the result, however, of the first inflection would appear to rule it out all.

500
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:12,079
No, that's the eternal critique.

501
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:17,839
And now, in 508, he starts in film, no, those and field consequences are few.

502
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,319
509 or so, we'll take my notes here.

503
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:24,400
His own positive view doesn't begin until 510.

504
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:40,400
At the very end of reduction out of Sword and Last Sartre, he tells you his view at the end of that long paragraph, about 15 lines from the end of the paragraph, the middle of 510.

505
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:48,320
By defining ourselves as a universal power of Zindgel, we should be used to that now, meaning giving.

506
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,519
That's Sartre.

507
00:46:50,639 --> 00:47:02,640
We have reverted to the method of the thing without which, with the analytic reflection of a traditional type, seeks the conditions of possibility without concerning itself with the conditions of reality.

508
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:25,119
I read that partly because I said he had this distinction, which he uses a lot, that he never makes blame between the conditions of existence, or sorry, the conditions of possibility, which are sort of abstract logical analyses, and the conditions of existence, where conditions of existence, he calls it here conditions of reality.

509
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,440
I remember it as conditions of existence.

510
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:33,079
I don't remember whether that's because the translation is different or because the words are different, but call it either one.

511
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:47,079
There's something going on, which is not just the logical possibilities, but which make possible whatever it is, sorry, make possible, which word, somebody gave me a good word.

512
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,879
Enabling, yeah, which the enabling conditions.

513
00:47:51,880 --> 00:48:12,839
The conditions of reality, the conditions of existence, the enabling conditions are what he thinks he's providing against sort of analytic philosophers and analytic phenomenologists like Christroll and Sark, who think that you shouldn't really worry about the actual phenomena, but just tell somebody about the logical possibilities.

514
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:16,840
So Sartre's arguments about freedom are extremely logical.

515
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:29,959
If you're a pure consciousness, if everything you experience has to be organized by you as a meaning giver, then, and then comes all these wonderful possible necessary possibilities, so to speak.

516
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:39,719
It all follows necessarily from a certain conception of consciousness, which Sark claims is just obvious, I guess, that we give it to you.

517
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,720
And he's going to say, no, if you look at the phenomena, you'll see something different.

518
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:45,479
You'll see the enabling conditions.

519
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,399
So I'm back to 510.

520
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:55,079
We must therefore resume the analysis of the Zen Gablung and show how it can be both centrifugal and centrifugal.

521
00:48:55,079 --> 00:49:03,640
That is, how I can both give meaning to the world, and the world can give meaning to my life.

522
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:14,159
That I'm both this source of freedom and the receiver of these absolute limitations, body and history kind.

523
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:20,719
So, since it has been established that there is no freedom without a field, now has he established that?

524
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:21,680
I don't remember.

525
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:26,639
Mostly he's established it by being on SART and going to what happens.

526
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:29,839
Ah, yeah, well, here's a way to say how he establishes it.

527
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:34,640
And this has got to do with the background story.

528
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,480
He doesn't have much to say, by the way.

529
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:43,759
It's so devastating that you can say it with the dots and the climbing of mountains in a paragraph, and it's over.

530
00:49:43,759 --> 00:49:45,999
I mean, Sartre just really can't explain that.

531
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,239
But he's much more interested in the history.

532
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:51,680
Now, why can there be no freedom without a field?

533
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:54,160
Well, I forget where it is in here.

534
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:57,040
But I think it's in here.

535
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:00,559
Sartre has the, well, actually, this is some other factor he talks about.

536
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,839
Sartre has, I remember now, it's in the Coventry chapter.

537
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,199
I mentioned it in class.

538
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:16,800
Sartre has a review about this person who has this adolescent crisis and then gives it a certain meaning, and then it turns out that they become a monk, and then it turns out that that was the wrong me, and so forth.

539
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:28,880
It looks like in Sartre, it's just up to you to give your life whatever meaning it just occurs to you suddenly to give it.

540
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,759
And now, I don't know if it's in here, but a better example is the gambler example.

541
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:40,320
Okay, well, it's something very good for him to talk about, and I don't know where he talks about it, but he must.

542
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:52,640
But anyway, Sartre has this great example, and I'll tell you because he shows you what Sarkrean total freedom looks like and why Meryl-Parnio Party thinks it's not freedom at all.

543
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:59,640
A gambler decides one evening that he's not going to gamble anymore, and he freely decides that.

544
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:03,079
The fact that he's been a gambler up to then all his life is irrelevant.

545
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:04,200
And he can do that.

546
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,120
That's like being born again and giving up drinking.

547
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:10,040
So he gives up gambling one night.

548
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:13,720
And the next night when he faces the gambling table, what has he got?

549
00:51:13,719 --> 00:51:15,400
Well, he's pure freedom.

550
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:26,359
He's free to either give the previous decision the meaning, boy, was I drunk or crazy then, I'm going back to gambling, or the meaning, yeah, didn't I decide last night not to gamble?

551
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,639
Well, then I won't gamble.

552
00:51:27,639 --> 00:51:28,759
But he's totally open.

553
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,920
He hasn't really decided anything.

554
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,439
Because at every moment, it's all up for grabs again.

555
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:39,800
When you've got that kind of total freedom, then there's no, it makes no difference.

556
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:53,239
It's only if the act of not gambling, and now I'm telling you more of what Narrow Party's story would be, is something which he, one, already is motivated to by something in the background.

557
00:51:53,239 --> 00:52:04,199
If his wife doesn't like it or he's dumb things, some things, reality forcing you to give it up, and that you've repeated it enough, that may be sort of like dieting.

558
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:13,079
You can decide one day that you're not going to eat any goodies, and the next day, his goodies are so good, and maybe we should start God made you then, but not just yet.

559
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:19,880
Paraphrasing Augustine, who says, God made me give up sex, but not just yet.

560
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:25,720
But in any case, you can do that, but unless and you undermine it.

561
00:52:25,719 --> 00:52:34,280
But or you can repeat your resolution, which is already based on some background, until it becomes part of the background.

562
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:40,280
And you are a dieter, or you are a non-gambler, or a teetotaler and stuff.

563
00:52:40,279 --> 00:52:44,480
And then that that's because it becomes sedimented in your history.

564
00:52:43,719 --> 00:52:48,000
I'm just telling you the story of the chapter rather than reading short.

565
00:52:48,320 --> 00:53:08,639
When it's sedimented in your history, it then becomes, and this is very interesting, View, not that you couldn't possibly go back to gambling or eating the goodies and so forth, but it becomes less and less probable the more it becomes the background.

566
00:53:09,279 --> 00:53:15,040
And so he thinks that you've got to introduce a notion of probability into your notion of freedom.

567
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,960
And then he gives a whole Sartrean story again.

568
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:23,279
I better keep up with where we are because it's suddenly become start again.

569
00:53:23,279 --> 00:53:25,759
On 512, let me see where we are.

570
00:53:25,759 --> 00:53:26,799
511.

571
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,199
Well, yeah, we should do these things right.

572
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:33,599
511 is where he talks in the middle of the page about our natural self.

573
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:36,000
And the natural self is the body.

574
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,440
And it can't climb the mountains that are too big and so forth.

575
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,479
The Alps can't be molehills for me, as he puts it.

576
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:50,559
And that's because, and I can't help reading this, below the middle of 511, because I have hands and feet.

577
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,799
The only place in the book where you know that the human body has hands and feet.

578
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,360
You don't ever know much more about the human body than that.

579
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:06,400
I think maybe someplace you find out, yeah, you do, if they have a face, because if you see the face upside down, it looks all weird.

580
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:18,000
But it's important to know that the body from Arila Clancy is so, he's making progress over everybody in the history of philosophy who didn't talk about the body at all, except as an object.

581
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:29,640
But boy, has he's got a long way to go to talk about the body and its front and back, up and down, balancing in a gravitational field, moving more easily forward than backward.

582
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,559
All that plays a crucial role in perception, but he doesn't know it.

583
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:38,440
I'm getting you a quick blurb for TOTUS's book, which I mentioned before, Body and World.

584
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:55,079
I mean, the great step forward of TOTUS is to try to describe the body in the philosophy so that, and show that, that the body having the structure it has is more than just what Berlopony says the body is, which is an I can.

585
00:54:55,079 --> 00:55:02,840
It's the ability to move around and organize things according to the body schema.

586
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:07,319
But the body schema hasn't got a front and a back and an up and a down and hands and feet.

587
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:11,160
It's just this shared way we have of coping.

588
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:21,400
So, but if you go beyond that, you could have a whole story about how the structure of the body gives you the way we have state, the way we have time, the way we have objects.

589
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:22,279
You're going to read it.

590
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,119
You have to read it on your own.

591
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:28,360
So, yeah, we've got some hands and feet, which is quite amazing.

592
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:33,640
And then there's the docs from Gustav psychology.

593
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:36,440
And you can't change the glue.

594
00:55:36,759 --> 00:55:39,399
And then you get back to Sartre on 512.

595
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:43,239
We should get used to this because he gives you signals.

596
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:56,279
The second sentence of the paragraph that begins: it is true not only of an impersonal of an impersonal, but, and in all abstract functions, such as there is something, so never mind.

597
00:55:56,279 --> 00:55:58,679
Now, about present evaluations.

598
00:55:58,759 --> 00:56:04,680
And now we're going to get the story about whether it's fun or not to backpack into the woods.

599
00:56:04,679 --> 00:56:08,599
But it has been presentedly remarked that Sartre.

600
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:11,559
The pain and fatigue depend on causes.

601
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:13,480
It's up to me what the causes are.

602
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:18,640
That goes down to the line 15, roughly on 513.

603
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,880
And that gets us to the probable, which is by a jump.

604
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:32,880
Since freedom does not tolerate on 513 now, any motive in its past, my habitual being in the world, is each moment precarious and so forth.

605
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:42,720
But it now comes, and from Sartre's point of view, no matter how much, and freedom can blow your past sky high.

606
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:45,920
And remember, I keep wanting to say it can.

607
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:49,840
But, and remember, that's the teetotaler example.

608
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:50,800
It can.

609
00:56:50,800 --> 00:57:00,400
However, having built our life, and now he gives an example, upon an inferiority complex which has been operating for 20 years, it's not probable we shall change.

610
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:05,520
Okay, well, that's a funny example for reasons I don't have too much.

611
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,000
I don't have time to fill in too much.

612
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,840
He's got, I'll mention it.

613
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:25,440
We should have said something more like, not the extreme pain of an inferiority complex, but something simple, like, having dieted for years, I'm not likely to take the chocolate clear that comes by in front of me.

614
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:32,480
And certainly, people, alcoholic anonymous people, don't take a drink every once in a while.

615
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:47,040
And that's because the more it gets sedimented into the background, and we'll get to that in a while, the more these things don't show up as tempting anymore, or they show up as unpleasant and so forth.

616
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:50,800
And that's going to help you and win your freedom.

617
00:57:50,800 --> 00:58:09,799
But he's got a whole theory, and that's good and right, and that's the right phenomenology of the normal way your past goes in front of you and determines what it makes sense for you to do, determines it's too strong, makes it probable.

618
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:18,280
Well, organize what it makes sense for you to do, like eat every goody that comes around or refuse everyone.

619
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:27,559
But it doesn't take away your freedom, but it makes it improbable that you're going to eat the next goody you've done so long because it doesn't look tempting any.

620
00:58:27,639 --> 00:58:29,559
But you put on a bat or something.

621
00:58:29,559 --> 00:58:30,840
That's the way it stands.

622
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:34,280
But then the inferiority complex is a really different story.

623
00:58:34,279 --> 00:58:39,480
He's got a whole theory of psychotherapy in here and psychopathology.

624
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:44,040
And I'm going to s say about two words about it and then you can read it on the website if you don't have time.

625
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:50,440
I've written a paper on it, which I think is the definitive word on the subject, probably because it's the only word on the subject.

626
00:58:50,679 --> 00:58:58,760
But he's got a whole view about transforms Freudian depth psychology with Marlow Country and breadth psychology.

627
00:58:58,759 --> 00:59:10,599
That is, the idea that your background can become so pervasive that it determines your sense of reality completely.

628
00:59:10,599 --> 00:59:24,440
And then you will get something like, take this example, this inferiority complex person who thinks that all of life is about who's the inferior and who's superior and knows that they're always on the losing end of that.

629
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,279
Or it could be the opposite.

630
00:59:26,679 --> 00:59:28,519
I just saw a French movie yesterday.

631
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,000
Look at me.

632
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,279
Anybody's seen it yet?

633
00:59:30,279 --> 00:59:44,159
There's this Frenchman, typically a Frenchman, who has got this sort of superiority complex, that only he that he knows everything and everybody ought to pay attention to him and that only his problems are really worth thinking and worrying about and so forth.

634
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,599
Anyway, you could have that, but let's stick to the inferiority person.

635
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:53,280
I mean, if it becomes your whole sense of reality, you're going to be stuck with it all your life.

636
00:59:53,279 --> 00:59:57,279
But because there's no way to see that there are any other possibilities.

637
00:59:57,279 --> 00:59:59,920
It looks like that's just how the world is.

638
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:05,279
And it's a question of that whether you're in school, it's a question of that whether you're in love, it's a question of that.

639
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:10,240
Everything turns into a struggle between who's superior and who's inferior.

640
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:23,119
But if there is any little marginal other things in there still, like maybe at least in, I don't know, computer games or something, you really can hold your own or beat everybody.

641
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:27,520
What happens in therapy is, that was a funny example, wouldn't work.

642
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:44,000
But I mean, if in your inner subjective relations there are bits of non-inferiority and superiority, then in therapy, you can gradually, by small deflections, he puts it, the therapist can get you to see that this isn't the only way to relate to everything.

643
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:53,599
And then bring more and more of your freedom back by emphasizing the part of the background that keeps it from looking like this is just the way everything is.

644
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:56,959
It just shows up that way and get you out of it.

645
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:09,199
He's got a whole beautiful story about that, which I'm not going to talk about, but we have to skip now from the inferiority and the background here kind of is placed in some sense.

646
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:09,920
Absolutely.

647
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,279
You just said that made that up.

648
01:01:11,279 --> 01:01:12,720
That's absolutely right.

649
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:13,519
Exactly.

650
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:14,400
Exactly.

651
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:25,119
What's not accessible to you and representable to you isn't some idea, some representation which has gone into the unconsciousness, sending out messages by way of symbols in a Freudian way.

652
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:29,879
What's inaccessible to you and controlling your life and ruining it is the background.

653
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:33,480
That's what I mean by breadth psychology as opposed to death psychology.

654
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:33,799
Yeah.

655
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:35,400
And he's got it worked out.

656
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:38,919
He's got a theory of repression, a theory of France, and everything.

657
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,359
It's all scattered through the book.

658
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,040
You just have to pull it together.

659
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:42,439
Yeah.

660
01:01:46,759 --> 01:01:51,639
There's another way of getting at the international art that we talked about in reference to Freud.

661
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,079
Absolutely.

662
01:01:53,559 --> 01:01:57,960
And sort of all these things are in there.

663
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:02,119
I'll say them all right now because time might run out before I have a chance to say them.

664
01:02:02,119 --> 01:02:08,040
He's got the same story that he tells about psychopathology.

665
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:12,440
He also gives, that's his adaptation of Freud.

666
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:27,960
Then he does an adaptation of Marx in which he does the same sort of thing, in which your class as a worker isn't something that you know and represent, and you have to be brought together with the other workers who know it and represent it and start a revolution.

667
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:33,559
And it also isn't something that you just don't know either.

668
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:35,399
You experience it all the time.

669
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,839
He has a list, a sort of touching list of what it's like to be a worker.

670
01:02:39,159 --> 01:02:42,760
These were the big deal in France at the time.

671
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:47,000
Everybody had to be sort of out Marxist and everybody else.

672
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:49,960
And where is it?

673
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,599
You know, the upper left-hand side of the page, I saw.

674
01:02:52,599 --> 01:03:00,759
It doesn't mean, okay, you depend on others and you haven't got as much money as you need and you have no future and so forth and so forth.

675
01:03:00,759 --> 01:03:07,880
Anyway, you have this background and it isn't as if you are aware of it, which could be the intellectualist view.

676
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:18,240
It isn't as if it's just a historical, sort of not historical, a kind of an economic fact about you, that you don't have enough money and that you can be fired and hired and so forth and so forth.

677
01:03:18,239 --> 01:03:19,119
It's neither.

678
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:21,359
It's a background style of life.

679
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,040
He introduces the notion of style very effectively.

680
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:34,400
The the inferiority complex is a kind of style that gets sedimented in your life, and being a worker is a kind of style that gets sedimented in your life.

681
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:54,160
And you what makes a revolution, and then he's got a whole story about revolution, which would be sort of like what it would be to be sure to be a worker, would be to become bit by bit aware of this and aware that you share it with other people and become a a member of the proletariat.

682
01:03:54,159 --> 01:04:03,599
You're not a member of the proletariat just by thinking you are, and you're not a member of the proletariat by having a certain salary, which is the objective thing.

683
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:14,559
You're a member of the proletariat when you come to identify yourself as a member of the proletariat, which you can't just freely and arbitrarily do, which is what's our thought.

684
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:30,000
It takes a lot of effort in therapy or in Marxism to get this background, which looks like reality, and thus into the foreground so that you can little by little overcome it.

685
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:36,960
So so uh sort of Marxist activism is a kind of therapy to the working class.

686
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,920
Uh so now let me see where we are.

687
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:43,360
Um could I keep jumping ahead?

688
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,719
Gringam and the problem did that.

689
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:49,520
We didn't probably switched we got rid of, we did, we did all that.

690
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,239
I don't know.

691
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:59,319
Where was the where was the I got sidetracked, I'm not sidetracked, it jumped ahead when we got to the the inferiority problem.

692
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:00,760
517.

693
01:05:02,279 --> 01:05:03,399
513.

694
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:05,399
Okay, so let me get, okay, yeah, there we are.

695
01:05:05,719 --> 01:05:08,360
Uh-huh, okay, yes.

696
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:16,200
Okay, yeah, the style is what is there in the background determining what it makes sense to do and what it doesn't make sense to do.

697
01:05:16,199 --> 01:05:31,399
And that style in the background, either shared or in my own, I mean, they're both, I said, is what he's going to talk about, is a way that the background governs what you do.

698
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,800
I want to add a new note in here.

699
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,240
Governs what you do.

700
01:05:35,239 --> 01:05:39,160
It doesn't empiricist cause you to do it.

701
01:05:39,159 --> 01:05:40,920
And it isn't intellectualist.

702
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:45,960
It isn't something you believe, and therefore because you believe it, you do it.

703
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:53,880
Having an inferiority complex doesn't cause you to behave in a cringing, inferior way toward everybody.

704
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:57,480
And it isn't that you believe that you're inferior.

705
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:01,720
It's something that is the atmosphere of your life, as he puts it.

706
01:06:01,719 --> 01:06:10,760
And it's something that's in your body, in your cringing attitude, and in your not looking people in the eye, and then you're already getting ready to be put down and so forth.

707
01:06:10,759 --> 01:06:19,320
And that way the world shows up for you as you being inferior.

708
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:27,880
That's the way your background determines, again, what it makes sense for you to do, and thereby governs what you do.

709
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:36,920
Not in a causal way and not in a belief intellectualist way, but in this governing kind of causality.

710
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:40,520
And that's what makes it probable.

711
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:43,480
The governing causality is what makes it probable.

712
01:06:43,679 --> 01:06:55,599
Because in the world, certain things make sense to you and other things don't, whether you're a worker or having a pure complex or dieting or whatever, that determines, not determines, governs what you do.

713
01:06:55,599 --> 01:07:02,239
And governing is a probabilistic notion because you could break out of it, but you normally don't.

714
01:07:02,239 --> 01:07:02,880
Yeah.

715
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:04,639
Ah, I don't think so.

716
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:05,919
It's time for a list.

717
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,120
It's close.

718
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:08,079
I've got a list here.

719
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:08,719
I'll patent you.

720
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,360
About four kinds of causality.

721
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:14,159
There's, so I'm here here.

722
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:17,599
I think he's got these different kinds of causality.

723
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:24,320
There's linear, physical, third-person causality.

724
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,719
It's Fumian constant conjunction.

725
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:35,360
It's Kant's, whatever it is, according to a rule, necessary succession according to a rule.

726
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:37,199
It's medieval.

727
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:42,240
It was a diffusion of power and capacity to natural kinds.

728
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:48,480
All of that, I think, he would, that's just, I think he probably calls it linear causality, though I didn't find a place.

729
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:50,000
Anybody know Carlhan?

730
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:52,960
I think third-person causality.

731
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:54,479
Third-person causality.

732
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,680
And it's the kind of causality of the in itself, of course.

733
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,479
It's physical causality.

734
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:01,919
That's not his contribution.

735
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:02,400
He has nothing.

736
01:08:05,199 --> 01:08:06,000
Good, good.

737
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:08,639
Walter Freeman must have taken it over from there.

738
01:08:08,639 --> 01:08:14,240
And Walter talks always about the wrong way of thinking about causality as linear causality.

739
01:08:14,239 --> 01:08:14,719
Okay.

740
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:19,119
Then there's mental causation, first-person causation.

741
01:08:19,119 --> 01:08:21,279
That's what Searle is interested in.

742
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:28,519
How my deciding to lift my arms can cause me, or my willing to lift my arm can cause my arm to go up.

743
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:34,119
That doesn't that's not linear physical causality, although it might it's grounded in it somehow.

744
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:37,079
But that's that's first person causality.

745
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:41,880
Now, neither of those, of course, is what Merlot-Ponty is interested in.

746
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:46,439
Now, then there's lived-body causality.

747
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:55,000
That's got to do with the third kind of being that we are, neither minds nor objects.

748
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,719
It has to do with responding to the solicitations of affordances.

749
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:08,920
It's the way my affordances cause me to act, which is not a physical kind and not an intellectual kind.

750
01:09:09,239 --> 01:09:13,479
And I think that's what we should call the motivational one.

751
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:22,199
And motivation, I want to try to distinguish motivation from intentional art, so I think they sort of probably swap over into each other.

752
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:23,559
You could distinguish it.

753
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:45,399
If you make the way the lived body and the perceptual system are tending toward equilibrium and so forth, and how unstable the stalls tend towards stability, and how binocular images in your eye, in your vision, tend to be overlapped so you see depth.

754
01:09:45,399 --> 01:09:49,399
And then when he talks about that, he describes all that in terms of motivation.

755
01:09:49,399 --> 01:09:54,359
So it's not just responding to affordances, though that is part of motivation.

756
01:09:54,359 --> 01:10:03,799
It's responding to all of the Stahl tensions that you have in your experience because you have the the perceptual system you you have.

757
01:10:04,279 --> 01:10:06,359
And I think, yeah, okay.

758
01:10:06,359 --> 01:10:16,960
I think that's probably the third kind of being, that is not first person causality nor linear causality, but this kind of motivational causality.

759
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:21,119
But there's another one, fourth one, circular causality.

760
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:23,920
He calls it dialectical causality, I think.

761
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:28,960
That's what I want to keep for the intentional art and the background governing.

762
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:50,000
The background governs people by way of having, so to speak, what was once something that they actually consciously did or decided or whatever, which they repeat enough until it becomes so transparent to them that it's like the light in the room.

763
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:55,920
That is, it's the background in terms of which they see whatever they do see.

764
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:02,159
And then things show up for them as making a certain sort of sense.

765
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:14,960
Their actions get into the very organization of their perceptual field.

766
01:11:15,279 --> 01:11:18,559
So some things look attractive and others don't.

767
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:23,359
And that, of course, solicits certain actions from them.

768
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:25,679
And that's where it looks like motivational.

769
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:29,840
I mean, but I want to make the emphasis on the circularness.

770
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:33,599
That, when you act on it, you contribute to it.

771
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:46,319
So the more you act and make choices that you would be, the more that becomes part of the background, then the more that further inclines you to make these kinds of choices.

772
01:11:46,319 --> 01:11:49,439
And that further becomes part of the background.

773
01:11:49,439 --> 01:12:10,119
So that your past experience and your past choices aren't there as your explicit memories aren't acceptable anymore, but they show up to you, so to speak, in the way your world looks to what it makes sense to do and what it doesn't make sense to do, what's attractive and what's repulsive and so forth.

774
01:12:10,119 --> 01:12:13,799
Which again solicits action-that's the circularity of it.

775
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:16,679
So, the background governs activity.

776
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:25,799
And that's I think that's his big contribution really in this environment.

777
01:12:26,359 --> 01:12:28,359
Now, yeah, yeah, good.

778
01:12:28,359 --> 01:12:29,000
We got four minutes.

779
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:29,720
I don't want to start.

780
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:32,760
I mean, that's really the bottom line for this chapter, so go ahead.

781
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,840
Just a third one, you know, significant source.

782
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,519
I don't, I'm not that sure.

783
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:51,880
But the language of psychotic and centrifugal is just like used to contrast abstract and concrete movements and trust and smartly categorize it in terms of in abstract backgrounds, where it's concrete and you can see a sort of slight background.

784
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:59,319
It's a bit interesting that not only Marxism and psychoanalysis are sort of formed now in the curve of the student.

785
01:12:59,399 --> 01:13:04,040
If he enjoyed that, but now cartologies learned in them.

786
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:05,159
That's interesting, yeah.

787
01:13:06,359 --> 01:13:09,239
I'm sure that he thinks about it that way.

788
01:13:09,239 --> 01:13:13,639
I'm just going to say one more thing about the background, if I can.

789
01:13:14,359 --> 01:13:29,000
The insight, which I haven't made clear enough yet, is that the way your background limits your freedom, I haven't been saying it, but not clearly enough, is it's because you don't see it.

790
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:35,239
I mean, what Sartre has to tell you is how you can change any particular thing that you can think about.

791
01:13:35,239 --> 01:13:36,759
You can do something else.

792
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:39,880
That's first-person causality, and so forth.

793
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:57,759
What what governs you is precisely what you don't see and don't even take for granted, but is just there the way the back the the lighting in the room is when it's gone to zero, so to speak, and you don't see it because all you see is the colors.

794
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:13,759
But that's that's what it really interests Merloboni, and how you can get back your freedom by taking up little bits of the background and fixing it is what interests him, I think, and what his big insight is.

795
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:24,159
To sort of say how things can go in and out of the background and thereby go from the kind of first person causality to governing causality and back.

796
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:24,799
Yes.

797
01:14:26,319 --> 01:14:39,839
A while back we had one example of level of sunlight and path and how once coming upon that evolved and that's what kind of sunlight.

798
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:48,720
How would according to his kind of perspective on Sarge Peter, how would he how would Sarge you would experience the dilemma?

799
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:52,239
Ah Sartre can't take account of it at all I think he would say.

800
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:55,920
It's that's a question of motivational stuff.

801
01:14:55,920 --> 01:15:07,760
I mean it isn't wasn't up to him to seek Sartre I mean it would just be a joke sort of it's part of the perceptual uh limits on our freedom that we can't just see anything anywhere we please.

802
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:08,880
I mean Sartre would think so.

803
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:18,640
I mean Sartre thinks that I remember in that somewhere he says you could you can experience yourself as having one eye in the middle of your forehead or your arms turned into snakes.

804
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:19,920
You're free to do that.

805
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:24,079
Of course, they'll lock you up if you do that because they'll say you're schizophrenic.

806
01:15:24,079 --> 01:15:29,399
But that's just their way of thinking about the kind of absolute freedom people have.

807
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,760
And so he's consistent.

808
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:39,559
I mean, I suppose he would say you can just think you're walking on the patches of sunlight till you fall, and then you can think that you didn't really fall.

809
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:41,720
And you can get any meaning to anything.

810
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,159
Sartre's clear about that.

811
01:15:46,519 --> 01:15:51,159
I mean, Sartre couldn't deny the phenomenon that's experienced actually.

812
01:15:51,479 --> 01:15:52,599
Wouldn't just freedom.

813
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:56,599
So what you're saying is for Sartre, bad faith begins to the point of misperception.

814
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,119
Good, you had mentioned bad faith.

815
01:15:58,119 --> 01:15:59,319
That's the right thing to say.

816
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:00,119
I don't know.

817
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:10,439
Wouldn't you say that bad faith begins upon reflection on the misperception?

818
01:16:10,439 --> 01:16:15,000
So the bad faith would begin when you deny that you had this misperception.

819
01:16:15,239 --> 01:16:16,920
I think they're deeper kind of bad faith.

820
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:23,000
I think Sartre would say that bad faith is really in a perceptual level conformism.

821
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:30,920
You just don't want to be locked up, so you're going to not exercise your freedom to have one eye in the middle of their forehead and their arms turning into snakes.

822
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:39,719
And that's just, and it's bad faith in that it would be, you know, you could, dimly you know it, and you know how upsetting it would be to be radically free like that.

823
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:44,359
That's what, that's what gives you anguish, according to Sartre.

824
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:47,960
So you'd accept the normal way of looking at things.

825
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:54,519
Only, instead of this being the generality of the body and perception, this is just the normal cover-up.

826
01:16:54,519 --> 01:16:59,559
And you abrogate your freedom and go along with it.

827
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:01,079
Sartre's going to have to say that.

828
01:17:01,079 --> 01:17:02,279
It's interesting to bring it up.

829
01:17:02,279 --> 01:17:14,040
About all this criticism from Harold Ponte, Sartre's going to have to say, you're just describing bad faith, you're just describing conformism, you could have done it otherwise, but you don't want to admit you could have done it otherwise.

830
01:17:14,479 --> 01:17:16,000
And how does Sartre know that?

831
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:26,800
Because you, as a free, meaning-giving consciousness, Husserl, if Husserl is right, then you are absolutely free to give anything any meaning and any cause any meaning.

832
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:29,040
And if you don't, that's your bad faith.

833
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,000
That's not a very satisfactory answer.

834
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:37,920
I mean, even Sartre gave it up later after reading the time, gave up this notion of radical freedom.

835
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,759
It just won't work.

836
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,119
Okay, we should stop at that.

837
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:41,760
Now, where are we?

838
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:48,079
Oh, yeah, next time, Eric is going to tell us about the neuro basis of affordances, in effect.

839
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:51,920
And then the last time we're going to talk about idealism and realism.

840
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:53,920
I wonder if we should reverse that.

841
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:54,880
Wait a second.

842
01:17:55,279 --> 01:17:59,599
Do you care whether you do it this next time or the last time?

843
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,239
I think you were going to hear that the whole schedule isn't here.

844
01:18:02,479 --> 01:18:03,359
I see if I miss.

845
01:18:03,359 --> 01:18:04,720
Well, that's their problem.

846
01:18:05,359 --> 01:18:06,880
Let me discuss this for a second.

847
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:13,040
For those of you writing papers about idealism and realism, it would be better to put that before Eric.

848
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:15,119
I think I will put it on the website.

849
01:18:15,119 --> 01:18:16,399
Tell your friends.

850
01:18:16,399 --> 01:18:18,000
If they miss it, that's their problem.

851
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,119
They should be here today.

852
01:18:19,119 --> 01:18:27,040
But it makes it how many would prefer to go do idealism and realism next and then Eric after that?

853
01:18:27,359 --> 01:18:28,719
Nobody cares.

854
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:34,079
How many prefer to do Eric as planned in the program now and freedom next?

855
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:35,359
I guess.

856
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:36,479
What?

857
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:40,720
No, well, I want you to do what is helpful to people.

858
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:42,559
Let's do that one more time.

859
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:46,000
Some professor out there been in his class didn't afford.

860
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,079
Yeah, okay.

861
01:18:48,079 --> 01:18:53,040
So does anybody have any strong feelings about this one or the other?

862
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:55,439
If not, we'll do it the way we plan to do it.

863
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:57,279
Okay, we're going to do it the way we plan to do it.

864
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:57,920
Erica's next time.
