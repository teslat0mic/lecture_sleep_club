00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,479
Remember, I started off last time saying the phenomena that he starts out being interested in in this chapter is the phenomena of perceptual constancy.

2
00:00:10,799 --> 00:00:26,639
And he thinks that if you understand properly the phenomena of perceptual constancy, then you'll have a chance at understanding the phenomenon of experiencing objects as real objects, the way we do in our everyday lived experience.

3
00:00:26,639 --> 00:00:34,320
And I went through and I said there's two different kinds of wrong ways to account for the phenomena of perceptual constancy.

4
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:55,559
The empiricist way that, at least in the Herder version, fails to make the distinction between experiencing, say, the size of the door to be a certain size, on the one hand, and experiencing that size in a certain way as I get closer to and farther away from the door.

5
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,239
So the empiricist failed to make that basic distinction.

6
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:10,760
It seems pretty clear that there is a distinction between the size that the door looks to be and the way I experience that size or the way that size looks in the given context.

7
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:38,680
Then I said the intellectualist does make that distinction, but what the intellectualist fails to notice is that when I experience the, for instance, distance to, when I take into account the distance to the object in order to see the way its size looks here, I take it into account by experiencing it as a determinate value, 13.

8
00:01:38,680 --> 00:02:03,479
And Velopolti wants to insist that there's an essential kind of indeterminacy in my experience of these contextual features, like the distance to the object, like the experience of the lighting context in which the color is presented, and like the experience of the orientation of the object with respect to me.

9
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,720
So there's an essential kind of indeterminacy.

10
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:15,159
So the intellectualists were right between the size that I see the thing to be and the way that size looks at the current distance.

11
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:20,199
But they didn't make the distinction in a way that accords with the phenomenon.

12
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:43,040
So we need to say something about what Mario Holti means when he says that I experience the distance to an object, or I experience the lighting context, and he talks about lighting a lot in this, in relation to this, or I experience the orientation of the object indeterminately.

13
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,560
We need to say something about what that means.

14
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,959
And I said last time, we don't want it working to experience, say, the distance to something determinately.

15
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,760
The real estate agent might be able to do that once she walks into the room and says 17 by 21.

16
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,839
But that's not the way we normally experience the distance to something.

17
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:10,240
So how do we normally experience the distance to something in our average everyday engaged experiences?

18
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:22,800
And in order to introduce that, I pointed towards the passage on my page 302, which is the passage about the painting.

19
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:24,000
351.

20
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,800
351 in your version.

21
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:31,440
352, okay.

22
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:38,159
I'll just start, so I'll start the new stuff today by reading this passage again.

23
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:50,639
So remember, right above where he starts talking about the painting, he says, for science and objective thought, an apparently small object, I would have that passage.

24
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,360
I don't see it.

25
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,279
In my version, it's about 10 lines down from the top of 302.

26
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:58,239
351, two-thirds of the way to the bottom.

27
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,760
For science and objective thought, and apparently small objects seen 100 yards away.

28
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:05,159
I got it, you wanted to.

29
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,079
Okay, yes.

30
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:06,639
Okay.

31
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,679
Three quarters of the way.

32
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:08,479
Three quarters.

33
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:21,880
For science for science and objective thought, and apparently small objects seen 100 yards away is indistinguishable from the same object seen ten yards away at a greater angle.

34
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,719
So this is the the kind of empiricist view.

35
00:04:25,719 --> 00:04:34,359
There's no difference between the the size it looks to be and the way that size looks at 100 yards as opposed to at 10 yards.

36
00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:36,440
The object is nothing, okay.

37
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:45,959
But but for me, the perceiver, the object 100 yards away, is not as real and present in the sense in which it is at 10 yards.

38
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:58,359
And I identify the object in all its positions, at all distances, at all appearances, insofar as all the perspectives converge towards the perception, which I attain at a certain distance and with a certain typical orientation.

39
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,480
So I'm going to stop there for just a second before we get to the painting.

40
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,600
So at 100 yards, the object's not as real and present.

41
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:13,639
Realness and presence of an object, that doesn't seem to be anything like a determinate quantity.

42
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:21,159
It's not like experiencing the distance to the object to be 17 feet or the size of the object to be 6 feet.

43
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:36,280
Somehow, the way in which I experience the distance to an object, 100 yards in this case, is in terms of how real and present the object at 100 yards is for me.

44
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:49,720
And to say that it's not as real and present as I'd like it to be, or as it is at 10 yards, is to say in some sense that I can't get a very good perceptual grip on it.

45
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,480
I can't see it very well.

46
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,280
I can't get a good experience of it.

47
00:05:54,279 --> 00:06:00,440
If I'm trying to get a sense of what size it is, this is too far away for me to be able to do that.

48
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,200
Okay?

49
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:12,480
And now I think it's in the context of that understanding of the experience of distance that you can understand properly what he means when he starts to talk about the picture.

50
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:20,159
This crucial perception ensures the unity of the perceptual process and draws into it all other appearances.

51
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:32,639
For each object, as for each picture in a knowledge gallery, there's an optimum distance from which it requires to be seen, a direction viewed from which it vouchsafes most of itself.

52
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:38,800
At a shorter or greater distance, we have merely a perception blurred through excess or deficiency.

53
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:45,600
We therefore tend towards the maximum of visibility and seek a better focus as with a microscope.

54
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:58,880
Tending towards the maximum visibility, that's this notion of maximum grip, that Mel Polty is always working in the background from L, but that he very rarely makes explicit.

55
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:09,040
That's this notion of the idea that if it's 100 yards away, I find myself drawn to get a bit closer in order to see its size well.

56
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:21,120
Or if I'm in the museum, you're in the museum, you're walking by, there's an enormous painting on the wall, you see it, and you automatically find yourself stepping back in order to see the painting better.

57
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,960
In order to see the painting better.

58
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,760
Of course, what the appropriate distance is will depend on which aspect of the object you're interested in.

59
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:38,160
What the appropriate distance for a ta for a particular task is, will depend upon what aspect of the object you're trying to focus on.

60
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:43,600
But the object itself will be understood in terms of these sort of background norms.

61
00:07:43,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Now, someone asked last time, what's the difference between this optimum distance, the optimum distance at which I feel myself to be able to see the thing best, and the optimum that the empiricists think is the distance that presents the true size of the object.

62
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:17,960
And I said something last time about how the optimum distance for the empiricist could just be a statistical norm, whereas the optimum distance for the right phenomenological view is a felt norm.

63
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,760
I immediately feel myself drawn in in order to see the picture a little bit better.

64
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,399
I find myself having to go back in order to see the picture better.

65
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:52,919
And if you look now on page, well, my 299, which is the opening page of the chapter, for you it is, okay, so the second paragraph, the second full sentence, he says, these are no truer than any other.

66
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,800
So, well, let's read the first sentence.

67
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,360
We'll read from the beginning of the paragraph.

68
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:16,039
What's presented to us in the case of each object, the psychologist will assert, this is the empiricist, are sizes and shapes which always vary with the perspective, and it's conventional to regard as true the size which the object has within reach, when within reach, or the shape which it assumes when it's in a plane parallel to the frontal elevation.

69
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:24,440
So the empiricist might actually say that, agree with the phenomenologist about what the optimum context is.

70
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,919
It's just that they understand that optimum differently than the phenomenologist.

71
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:33,760
For the empiricist, these presentations are no truer than any other.

72
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:45,360
But since this distance and this aspect are both typical, that's to say they're the statistical norm, that's when the subject makes the most accurate kinds of judgments about size and shape.

73
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,200
And evolved with the help of our body, we can always recognize them and they provide standard in that sense.

74
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,440
Yeah.

75
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,040
Where the ponies and understanding is that the optimal group is developed into the individual who's experiencing the things of a certain distance, right?

76
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:07,279
The empiricist can bring you that this is a universal set of statistical boundaries in which...

77
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,079
I don't think the empiricist has to claim that.

78
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:17,120
The empiricist could be perfectly happy saying, yeah, no, there's a different statistical norm for different subjects.

79
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:24,079
For a person who can't see the thing very well, they make more accurate judgments at this closer distance.

80
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:29,840
And sort of the person with 20-20 vision, they make more accurate judgments at this further distance.

81
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:38,399
I think both of them can account for the fact that what counts as a norm for me might be different than what counts as a norm for you.

82
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:47,840
The difference is going to be that the empiricist can only say that as a matter of statistical fact, whereas the phenomenologist says that as a matter of felt phenomenological fact.

83
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:54,320
For the phenomenologist, it's not just true that I make better judgments when standing a little bit closer.

84
00:10:54,319 --> 00:11:09,360
It's that when I'm looking at the thing, I immediately find myself compelled to walk a little bit closer in order to now immediate compulsion to do something in response to the presentation of the object.

85
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,680
That's a very funny phenomenon.

86
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:26,520
And one of the things that's very funny about it is that it only seems to work when I'm not paying attention to whether it's going to work or not.

87
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:41,720
So I only find myself coordinating my distance appropriately with respect to the painting when it's the painting that I'm looking at and I'm not trying to pay attention to how far away from it I am.

88
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:52,440
If I'm trying to pay attention to how far away I am from the painting, to what my distance to it is, then I start to try to do something more like what a real estate agent does.

89
00:11:52,439 --> 00:11:58,040
I try to approximate the distance and give it a determinate value.

90
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:16,600
But what's important about these kinds of about this sort of normative force of the contextual features or what Marlowe Fonti sometimes calls the normative force of the atmosphere, where that means the lighting context and the distance to the object and the orientation with which it's presented.

91
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:26,760
What's important about the normative force of these atmospheric elements of the situation is that they've only got a certain kind of normative force.

92
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:43,000
They only draw me to act in a certain way when I'm not when they're in the background, when I'm not paying attention to them, but paying attention to the way in which those contextual features allow me to get a better or worse experience of the thing that I'm focused on.

93
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,800
I'm not even paying attention to that.

94
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,159
They're just acting there.

95
00:12:51,480 --> 00:13:01,200
And what I'm paying attention to is the thing that I'm looking at, the size of the door or the painting or the color presented in a certain lighting context.

96
00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:03,039
That's what I'm paying attention to.

97
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,320
That's the figure.

98
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:06,240
That's the thing that I'm focused on.

99
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,000
Of course, it's always presented in a certain context.

100
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,440
The color is always presented in a certain lighting context.

101
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,200
The size of the object is always presented at a certain distance.

102
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:28,960
And I have to be taking into account those contextual features in some way in order for me to experience the size or shape or color of the object.

103
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:36,240
But the way in which I'm taking them into account is not by focusing on them, but allowing them to direct my activity with respect to the circumstances.

104
00:13:36,319 --> 00:13:38,880
Okay, this is a puzzling claim.

105
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:46,159
So what I'm going to try to do is spend most of the lecture today developing that claim.

106
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,679
That's the idea, though.

107
00:13:47,679 --> 00:14:10,559
The basic idea to repeat, is that the sense in which I experience, say, the distance to an object indeterminately, rather than determinately, as the real estate agent and the intellectualist thinks, is just the sense in which I experience how well that distance allows me to see the thing I'm really focused on.

108
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:20,399
And the how well here isn't itself experienced, except insofar as it draws me to act in a certain way, to get closer or to get further away from the painting.

109
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:41,199
Now, Melvin thinks that maybe the best example of this kind of atmospheric element that has to act in this normative way, sort of atmospheric, environmental, contextual element that's part of my experience, that has to act in this normative way is the example of the lighting context.

110
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,000
And he talks about the lighting context quite quite a lot.

111
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,720
Before I do, let me just back up for a second.

112
00:14:48,359 --> 00:15:06,519
You might remember that from the very beginning of the book, Manel Ponti talks about how the Gestalt psychologists have discovered that the most basic kind of visual experience that you can have is the experience of a figure against the ground.

113
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:14,839
So that might be, for instance, the experience of a color in a lighting context or an object against a visual background.

114
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:20,839
But the most basic kind of experience I can have is the experience of a figure against the ground.

115
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:40,760
And he complains that almost all the psychologists and philosophers who've come before him, pretty much all of them, have failed to make any essential important distinction between the way in which I experience the figure and the way in which I experience the visual background.

116
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:55,720
And the important distinction, Manel Ponti thinks, is supposed to be that the visual background is something that I'm constantly taking account of, even if I'm not focused on it in the way that I'm focused on the figure that I'm looking at.

117
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:08,440
So when I look at an object against a visual background and I'm really focused on it, the visual background, this other stuff in my visual field, is part of my experience.

118
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,559
But it doesn't play the role in my experience that the thing I'm focused on does.

119
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:17,799
And you need to make some sense of what that distinction is.

120
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:36,720
And that distinction is going to be the same as the distinction between the way in which the color that I'm focused on figures in my experience and the way in which the lighting context does, or the way in which the size that I'm focused on figures in my experience, and the way in which my distance to it does.

121
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:43,039
So all these contextual elements, these atmospheric elements, are elements of the background.

122
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:45,119
They figure in my experience.

123
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:54,559
I take them into account in some sense or another, but they don't figure in my experience determinately the way the foreground does.

124
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:58,000
Let me now let me move to the lighting.

125
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,159
Because the lighting, I think, is where Melo Monti thinks they've got the best chance of making.

126
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:08,079
So Melo Monti starts talking about the lighting on my page 309.

127
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,279
Pages down.

128
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,319
360.

129
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:18,799
So the paragraph begins, but this functional relation has so far failed to make clear.

130
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,599
59.

131
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,079
Yeah.

132
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:24,880
Okay.

133
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:32,960
And there's some introductory stuff that leads up to the question: what finally is lighting?

134
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,720
About six sentences in.

135
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:45,200
And then about another six or seven sentences down, he says, what's peculiar about it, about lighting?

136
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,599
What's strange about lighting?

137
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,439
Does everyone see what's peculiar about it?

138
00:17:53,279 --> 00:18:00,480
What occurs when a certain patch of light is taken as lighting instead of being taken for granted?

139
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:07,039
When lighting is taken for granted, it's part of the atmosphere, it's part of the environment, it's part of the background.

140
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:13,279
It's something that allows me to focus on something else, but it's not something that I'm focused on itself.

141
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,399
Go here.

142
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,680
And taken 180 degrees wrong here.

143
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,159
Read that sentence again, what occurs?

144
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:24,119
What occurs when a certain patch of light is taken as lighting instead of being taken for granted?

145
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:27,079
And then it's come out now instead of in its own right.

146
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,160
Am I meaning that's the opposite?

147
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,720
That's you have.

148
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,559
Yes, mine is older than those.

149
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:42,760
But it's completely wrong, business.

150
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,799
Taking it in its own right is one thing.

151
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:46,679
And what was the other one?

152
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,440
Taking it for lighting.

153
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,559
As lighting.

154
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:59,800
When it's taken as lighting, as opposed to taking for granted, I think what matters is what you understand to him to mean that it's taken as lighting.

155
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:03,000
Lighting could either be the thing that you're looking at or the context.

156
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,679
So they've just switched.

157
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:11,000
Taking instead in its own right means for me to be focused on.

158
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,640
But it could mean doing its job in the background.

159
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,679
And how is the lighting?

160
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:17,880
Taken for granted.

161
00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:18,679
That's much better.

162
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,079
Yeah.

163
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:19,959
That's not ambiguous.

164
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,159
Yeah, but the first term is ambiguous too.

165
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,720
Taken as lighting could mean either taken for granted is good.

166
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,760
That clarifies.

167
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,599
If you don't see the distinction yet, this conversation won't have made any sense.

168
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:35,319
So we need to get the distinction on the table.

169
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:40,439
Roughly the distinction, lighting is something that in certain contexts you can look at.

170
00:19:41,319 --> 00:20:00,399
If the movie projector sort of sends a code of light, or the flashlight sends a code of light, you can either look at the code of light, right, and then you're looking at the light itself, or you can be within the code of light, and the light helps you to see other things.

171
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:05,119
And when the light's helping you to see other things, that's when it's taken for granted.

172
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,199
It's the background that allows you to see the rest of the stuff.

173
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:17,599
When it's just like another object, when it's a cone of light, then it's something different, and our experience of it is something different.

174
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:20,720
We see it as figure instead of seeing it as background.

175
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:34,000
And Melbourne is interested in that distinction, and in particular, he wants to know what it is to experience the light when we're taking it for granted and it's allowing us to see everything else.

176
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,480
That's what he wants to try to explain.

177
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:48,000
In order to explain it, he wants to make this distinction between looking at the light like you might look at an object and allowing the light to let you look at other objects.

178
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,079
So then he has this interesting anecdote, which explains something funny that I'll tell you, or might explain it.

179
00:20:54,079 --> 00:21:06,640
Only after centuries of painting did artists perceive that reflection on that reflection on the eye, without which the eye remains dull and sightless, as in the paintings of the early masters.

180
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:14,879
So if you look at early 15th century paintings, portraits of people, the eyes are just little black dots.

181
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:19,839
And I think it's more or less right to say, the faces look dull and lifeless.

182
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:22,480
They don't look like they're faces of real people.

183
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:47,880
At a certain point in the Renaissance, right around 1500, Amrish Dürer is usually credited with this discovery, painters started noticing that if you paint the reflections that occur in someone's eye, so if the lighting is coming from over there, they might paint a little reflection from out the window, they might paint a little reflection of a window on this part of the eye.

184
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:50,359
Just a tiny little thing.

185
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:56,519
And Dürer does it in a self-portrait that he paints of himself in around 1500.

186
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:59,720
That's not, oh, do you have a French version?

187
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:03,319
Can you show me the cover of it?

188
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:05,799
No, the front cover.

189
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:12,039
The front cover has a painting, a self-portrait of Dürer, painted by Dürer.

190
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:16,039
No, it's not the one that has the little reflections in the eyes.

191
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:17,799
This is an earlier painting.

192
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:24,039
The one that's most famous, where I started to paint these reflections, is painted about seven years after that one.

193
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:25,799
But we give these people credit.

194
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,879
Maybe that's what they were thinking when they put him on the.

195
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:45,720
And what's supposed to happen, art historians always tell us this, and if you look at the paintings, there's something to it, is that when they paint these little reflections in the eye, even if you don't notice the reflection, somehow the face becomes more lively.

196
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:53,399
It looks like it's a sort of living, a painting of a living person instead of a dull, flat, and lifeless representation of something.

197
00:22:53,399 --> 00:22:57,879
So Merofonte says, the reflection is not seen as such.

198
00:22:57,879 --> 00:23:10,279
So when you're looking at the painting, you don't notice this little reflection there, at least for a while, just as the painters up until then never noticed that people have these little reflections in their eyes.

199
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:26,839
The reflection is not seen as such, since it was, in fact, able to remain unnoticed for so long, and yet it has its function in perception, since its mere absence deprives objects and faces of all life and expression.

200
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:42,879
So, here's a case where we're taking account of this little bit of lighting, not in the sense that we're in its environment, but in the sense that it livens up the figure, it livens up the representation of the face.

201
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:53,519
So, this is to show there's a way of taking account of lighting that's not a way of noticing it as lighting, that changes our experience of the thing that we're looking at.

202
00:23:53,519 --> 00:24:03,519
And that's another version of the distinction that Melapulty wants to make between two different ways in which we can take account of lighting.

203
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:12,400
It can be part of our environment and it changes the way we perceive the thing that we're really focused on, or it can be something that we're focused on itself.

204
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,160
And in the painting, you can do that.

205
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,960
You can focus on the little reflection of the window that's in the eye.

206
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,119
Okay, so the reflection is seen only incidentally.

207
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:25,279
It's not something I focused on.

208
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:39,199
It's not presented to our perception as an objective, as something that I can come to focus on, something that's got determinate qualities, but rather as an auxiliary or as a mediating element.

209
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:47,760
It's something that helps me to understand the thing I'm focused on differently, or helps me to experience the thing I'm focused on differently.

210
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:53,119
It's not seen itself, but causes us to see the rest.

211
00:24:54,079 --> 00:25:03,919
I think that should probably be motivating, if he were using his terminology right, because it's not a causal fact, it's an intentional fact.

212
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,279
But you get the idea.

213
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,880
It's not something that we focus on.

214
00:25:06,879 --> 00:25:13,039
We don't focus on the little reflection in the eye, but it changes the way we see the whole portrait.

215
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:23,000
And the fact that it changes the way we see the whole portrait tells us that it's something we're taking account of, even if we're not focused on it.

216
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:33,399
Now, and then he goes on and says that reflections and lighting and photography are often badly reproduced because they're transformed into things.

217
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,799
They're things that are represented as objects, as things that I can focus on.

218
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:45,640
Sometimes you see in an old sort of early master painting, you see the lighting coming into the window and it's a cone.

219
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,000
It's a cone of light.

220
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:51,639
Sometimes that happens in photographs as well.

221
00:25:52,200 --> 00:26:05,960
And if in a film, for example, a person goes into a cellar holding a lamp, holding a flashlight, say, we don't see the beam of light as an immaterial entity exploring the darkness and picking out objects.

222
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,199
In other words, they're not part of our environment.

223
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,399
It's not something that helps us to see things better.

224
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:17,320
Rather, it becomes solidified and can no longer display to us the object at its far end.

225
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:24,039
We see it as an object instead of something that helps us to experience objects.

226
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:36,359
Okay, well, light moving over a wall produces only pools of dazzling brightness which are localized not on the wall, but on the surface of the screen in this bad sort of film example.

227
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:47,800
And then here's the really essential characterization of what it is for the light to play this normative role in the environment and in an eye stage.

228
00:26:47,799 --> 00:27:05,440
Lighting and reflection, lighting when it's our environment, when it's not something we're focused on, and the reflection on the eye when I'm looking at the face of the portrait, then play their part only if they remain in the background as discreet intermediaries.

229
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:14,399
So they have to be not the thing that I'm focused on, but the thing that I'm taking account of in focusing on this other stuff.

230
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:20,079
And they have to lead our gaze instead of arresting it.

231
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:27,199
The lighting leads our gaze in just the way that the distance to the picture leaves me.

232
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:37,519
It causes me to move closer to see or motivates me to move closer to see the painting better or to move back to see it better.

233
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,039
Okay, then he asks a natural question.

234
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,039
What do we mean by that?

235
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:45,599
What am I talking about?

236
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,039
And then he gives this sort of interesting example.

237
00:27:49,039 --> 00:28:02,320
He says, when I'm led to a strange apartment towards its owner, you don't understand the example unless you live in a world where apartments are such that the butler opens the door and leads you in to see the owner, right?

238
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:04,240
But I think that's what he's thinking of.

239
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,199
I'm led to a strange apartment towards the owner.

240
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:17,439
When I am led to a strange apartment towards the owner, there's someone who knows on my behalf, the butler who's leading me through this labyrinthine apartment.

241
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:23,359
There's someone who knows on my behalf for whom the unfolding of the visual spectacle has a meaning.

242
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,439
He understands where we're going and I'm just following him.

243
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:33,920
And who moves towards a goal and I entrust or lend myself to this knowledge, which I do not possess.

244
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,359
So I just follow him.

245
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:40,399
I'm led by him, and I don't know where we're going, but I trust that he knows where we're going.

246
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,039
This is the kind of metaphor that Manel Poltzy's got.

247
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,760
And he thinks that lighting is just that way.

248
00:28:45,879 --> 00:28:56,439
Or, here's another example: when some detail in a landscape which I've been unable to distinguish alone is pointed out to me, there's someone who has already seen it.

249
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:01,720
So there we are looking at this beautiful landscape, and your friend says, Oh, you notice that little tip of the mountain?

250
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,679
It looks like the man in the mountain lying down sleeping, or something like that.

251
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:13,240
It's pointed out to me, there's someone who's already seen it, who already knows where to stand and where to look in order to see it.

252
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,720
And the lighting is like that, he says.

253
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:22,919
The lightning directs my gaze and causes me to see the object so that, in a sense, it knows.

254
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:29,000
The lighting knows, and it sees, the lighting sees the object.

255
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:34,199
And when I think about this passage, I think about a slightly different example.

256
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,880
I think, imagine yourself looking at a table.

257
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:46,599
This is not a uniform color, but at a table that's a uniform color, a wall that's a uniform color, but that's unevenly lit.

258
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:52,360
And it's unevenly lit in such a way that you don't see the shadows as shadows.

259
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:54,359
You don't see them as objects.

260
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:58,119
But nevertheless, the lighting is a little better over here and a little worse over here.

261
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,760
And ask, put yourself in that situation.

262
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:05,960
And then imagine that someone says, well, look at the color of that wall.

263
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,039
Tell me about the color of the wall.

264
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:10,199
I think this is what happens.

265
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:17,559
I think you go and you look at a certain part of the wall and it doesn't feel like it's presented well.

266
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:21,000
It doesn't feel like you can get a very good sense of the color of the wall.

267
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:28,600
And you find your eyes going to someplace else, to some other part of the wall, as if they're away.

268
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:30,279
You're not moving them, really.

269
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,960
You certainly don't know what you're doing.

270
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:41,039
You're certainly not thinking, hmm, there's 12-foot candles of light over there, and that's about the right lighting context.

271
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:43,519
You don't have any knowledge like that.

272
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:50,399
You just find your eyes moving to where the lighting is best in order to pay attention to the color.

273
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,039
Yeah?

274
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,960
Yeah, just about.

275
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,640
I'm going to talk about that.

276
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,879
I mean, what in this passage, there's someone who leads us is the lighting.

277
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:21,919
Now, the lighting speaks directly to me through sort of, who's speaking to my motor intentional capacities, which are the capacities that I have in virtue of my understanding of my body schema.

278
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:26,080
So the body schema is sort of very, very relevant here.

279
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:32,799
But strictly speaking, in the analogy that he's drawing in this passage, what leads is the lighting.

280
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,959
Because it's the lighting that knows where I can see the color best.

281
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:52,319
And my eyes, through no really determinate effort of my own, I just find my eyes going to that part of the wall where the lighting is best for me to see the color and not lingering over here where it's not very good to see the color.

282
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:52,639
Yeah.

283
00:31:53,120 --> 00:32:00,240
The light knows the feeling of the compulsion is l as a cat you believe.

284
00:32:00,479 --> 00:32:01,919
That's a good, good point.

285
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,199
Yeah, that's exactly right.

286
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:16,600
What he means, at least at this point, is not, or at least not necessarily, that there's some weird spooky claim, like the lighting is this magical thing.

287
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:21,000
What he means is that I experience the lighting that way.

288
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:30,439
When it's in the background, when it's the atmosphere that allows me to see things, other things, how do I experience it?

289
00:32:30,439 --> 00:32:35,799
Well, I don't experience it as an object, as I do when it's a code of light that I can look at.

290
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:37,880
I experience it some other way.

291
00:32:37,879 --> 00:32:45,399
And the other way that I experience it is in terms of how well it allows me to see the thing that it's letting me focus on.

292
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:46,360
Yeah, exactly.

293
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:54,519
So it's not, it doesn't at least yet have to be a spooky claim about, you know, light's not really photons.

294
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,319
It's, you know, it's butlers or something.

295
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,040
It doesn't have to be a spooky claim like that.

296
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:09,159
It's a claim about the difference between the way, what it's like to experience light as an object and what it's like to experience it as an atmosphere or an environment.

297
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,319
Yeah, that's a great, great question.

298
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:21,079
Now, Melvulke does think, though, that the phenomenology is a guide to the ontology.

299
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:32,519
And in the very late works, he's going to end up saying something like, well, you know, we really can't do an ontology of subjects and objects because it's not adequate to the phenomenology.

300
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,919
And really, we need a different kind of ontology.

301
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:45,719
What there is, too cool, what there is full stop is, and he's going to have an intermediate ontological category, something between subject and object that he calls the flesh.

302
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:54,520
I'll read a passage from From the Visible and the Invisible, which is the link book in just a second that's related to that.

303
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:11,840
Okay, so now what's important about the lighting then, when I experienced it as the environmental context, when I experienced it as something that allows me to see everything else, when I experience it as the background, is that it's got this normative force.

304
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:18,480
I experienced it in terms of how well it allows me to see something, something else, right?

305
00:34:18,479 --> 00:34:24,799
And I experience it as leading me to the place where it's best, where the lighting is best.

306
00:34:24,799 --> 00:34:40,080
Now, why does Maril Colti say that I experience the lighting as being or knowing what's out there in the environment?

307
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,599
Being or knowing the thing?

308
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,959
Well, we've sort of said it.

309
00:34:43,120 --> 00:35:00,399
The reason is that it's wrong to say, phenomenologically wrong to say that in that context, when I experience the lighting as environment or atmosphere, I experience myself as going to see where the lighting is best.

310
00:35:00,959 --> 00:35:03,440
That's just a bad account of the phenomenology.

311
00:35:03,439 --> 00:35:09,519
Instead, the right thing to say is that I feel myself drawn by what?

312
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,679
Well, by the lighting in some sense.

313
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:18,319
I feel myself drawn to look at the color of the wall over here where the lighting is the best.

314
00:35:18,319 --> 00:35:36,560
So that is a way of saying that in order to do the best account, in order to give the best account that you can of the phenomenology, you really need to say that the way I experience the world is as imbued with this meaningful stuff.

315
00:35:36,879 --> 00:35:47,160
The way I experience lighting, when it allows me to see other stuff, is in terms of its drawing me to a certain place in order to focus on it.

316
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:59,319
And you can see why that he might be drawn to say something like that, because it really is wrong to say when my eyes, when I find my eyes going over there, that I've done it.

317
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:04,919
It's also wrong to say that it was done completely non-intentionally.

318
00:36:04,919 --> 00:36:06,599
It's not like it's a reflex.

319
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,640
I mean, there's really a right and a wrong place to look.

320
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:13,799
And I'm sensitive to the fact that that's a better place to look than the other.

321
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:23,079
And when my eyes are circling around looking for the best place to see the color, there's a sense in which I get that this is better than that.

322
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:32,520
So it's really supposed to be an intentional fact that my eyes are drawn to look there rather than there, not just a motor reflex.

323
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,479
But it's not an intentional fact that belongs, it's not my intentionality.

324
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:45,639
One doesn't have to have knowledge of how the lighting gets seeing a good color, but does one have to have knowledge of what the good color is in the first place, what they're looking at?

325
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:53,799
I mean, yeah, you have to actually be aware of, you know, the goal of the passive being or that.

326
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:58,680
Yeah, and I think this is another good and slightly complicated vector.

327
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,920
So there's two things to say about it.

328
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:08,520
One is that it takes a while developmentally for you to be able to focus on colors.

329
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,879
Many aren't so good at focusing on colors.

330
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:25,399
And if you don't perfectly know the difference between various colors, then you also won't have really any good sense of what it is for a color to be well lit as opposed to poorly lit.

331
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,879
So there's some indoctrination.

332
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:35,919
It takes some time to gather the habit of responding to the normative total of the light.

333
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,760
So that's one thing.

334
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:53,680
But the other thing is that when you do have knowledge of the lighting and colors, once you're sort of a fully grown human being, like we are, and phenomenology really tends to focus on phenomenology for grown-ups, right?

335
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:04,799
Once you're someone like that, there's not going to be a very simple all-purpose account of when the lighting is best and when it's poor.

336
00:38:04,799 --> 00:38:15,440
Because as a matter of fact, what counts as good lighting for seeing a particular color is going to depend upon what color it is that you're seeing.

337
00:38:15,439 --> 00:38:19,279
For darker colors, you need brighter light to see them well.

338
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:24,559
And for lighter colors, you need a little dimmer light to see them well.

339
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:29,360
So the whole hardware kind of takes for granted that we know what a good blue looks like.

340
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:44,719
Yeah, well, not only a good blue, but it takes for granted the fact that I'm sensitive in being led by this light to what a good context is for seeing this very shade of blue, not just the generic blue, but this very shade of light.

341
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,359
That's right.

342
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:49,279
I mean, there's a lot of bootstrapping that goes on here.

343
00:38:49,279 --> 00:39:08,480
Because to see that as the best place to see the color of the wall, that lighting context says the best place to see the color of the wall, is already to see the color of the wall as one shade of off-white rather than another shade of off-white.

344
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:20,120
If that were the best place to see the color of the wall, well, that could only be because the color of the wall is different, because that lighting context, so there is this sort of thing that goes on.

345
00:39:20,279 --> 00:39:22,119
No, I don't think it's a weakness at all.

346
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:27,159
I think it's, I but I'll try to spell it out.

347
00:39:27,479 --> 00:39:40,040
It's not meant to be a reductive account, and that's one reason that it's not, it doesn't count as a weakness, not to be a description of the way in which I experience the lighting context when presented with the color.

348
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,519
So that's one reason that it's not a weakness.

349
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,720
But I'll try to say a little something more about it in just a second.

350
00:39:45,879 --> 00:39:46,440
Yeah.

351
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,839
Isn't there an element of pasticity as well?

352
00:39:48,839 --> 00:40:00,999
Because things that land on GM tests and other color tests show that if I take some particular object, like one of the posters out there, and I dial down the sound for light, that it will still look blue.

353
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:04,600
You know, even if, you know, whatever, yeah.

354
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:10,839
But if I look at a swatch, you know, and where if I really was going to focus on a particular green, they might, you know, all change the color.

355
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,200
Yeah, so, okay.

356
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,120
So let me try to say a few things about that.

357
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:25,080
One is that it's absolutely true that as the lighting gets, you know, a little bit dimmer or a little bit brighter, I continue to see this thing to be the same color.

358
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,479
That's the phenomenon of color constancy that we're starting out with, right?

359
00:40:29,799 --> 00:40:32,119
So I do see it to be the same color.

360
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,920
I see that wall to be a uniform color.

361
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:47,079
And yet, when I'm seeing it, there's no denying that the color it looks to be looks a little bit different where poorly lit than where well it lives.

362
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:52,760
I guess what I meant to say is, I mean, even as you shine out of the light on it, you know, such stack and even hoard it, it could be horrible.

363
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:57,160
It wouldn't look good, like, it doesn't look even simple but holding.

364
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,479
Yeah, that's right.

365
00:40:59,479 --> 00:41:05,360
I mean, so that's the talk that's to say that the bounds of the color constancy effect are pretty radical.

366
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:07,120
But I mean, that's so that's the thing.

367
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:17,919
You could make it a lot dimmer, and it still wouldn't look like it changed color unless, and this is the second thing to say about it, unless you took it out of context, which is what happens when you take the photograph, right?

368
00:41:17,919 --> 00:41:28,480
The way in which the color constant effect works is that I need to be looking at the whole scene in order to see the color of the thing that has the constant uniform color.

369
00:41:28,879 --> 00:41:33,600
And if you just focus on a little bit of it, you lose the constancy.

370
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:57,999
Meleponce talks about this a little bit when he quotes Cesar, I think it's in this chapter, when he quotes Cesar as saying, look, the amazing thing, or maybe it's Lonet, I think he quotes Lonay as saying, look, the amazing thing is that here I am painting this beautiful blue sea, and all I have to do is put a dull of yellow up in this corner, and the whole color of the sea changes, right?

371
00:41:57,999 --> 00:42:02,560
I mean, it is a contact, it is a whole, there's a whole, what he calls field effect.

372
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:10,480
It's because I see it in the context of this broader organized field that I see the constant color to be one thing rather than another thing.

373
00:42:10,479 --> 00:42:16,079
And when you take away the, when you take it in bits, you lose that whole.

374
00:42:16,399 --> 00:42:23,120
So the main thing we were talking about was the kind of intentionality involved in the claim that the lighting leads the gaze.

375
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:34,000
And in the phenomenology of perception, he puts the intentionality out in the world and says, the way I experience it is as if it's the lighting that knows and sees the thing.

376
00:42:33,999 --> 00:42:50,200
Later on, in this late sort of book that Meleoponzi never finished because he died, this book called The Visible and the Invisible, Melopolti says something a little bit different.

377
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:53,159
I'll just read you a quick passage from the visible and the invisible.

378
00:42:53,240 --> 00:43:02,920
He says, the look, or the gaze, envelops, palpates, and espouses the visible thing.

379
00:43:02,919 --> 00:43:07,400
So think again of the case where you're looking at the color of the wall.

380
00:43:07,399 --> 00:43:10,520
The look envelops, palpates, and espouses the visible thing.

381
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:16,840
As though it were in a relation of pre-established harmony with them, as though it knew them before knowing them.

382
00:43:16,839 --> 00:43:20,440
It moves in its own way with its abrupt and imperious style.

383
00:43:20,439 --> 00:43:23,000
And yet the views taken are not desultory.

384
00:43:22,999 --> 00:43:26,120
I don't look at a chaos, but I look at things.

385
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,919
I experience the world as filled with things.

386
00:43:28,919 --> 00:43:36,120
So that finally one cannot say if it's the look or if it's the things that command.

387
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,760
Now this is a slightly different account of the phenomenology.

388
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:48,920
In this case, it's not the stuff out in the world that's got the intentionality that leads my eyes to see it well.

389
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:55,960
But you can't say whether the intentionality belongs out of the world or belongs here in me.

390
00:43:55,959 --> 00:43:58,999
But in some sense, it doesn't really belong in either place.

391
00:43:58,999 --> 00:44:24,920
And that's why, I think that's the key to why Melopolty in the late work thinks that you need this new ontological category that's neither the subject that's the seed of all intentionality, nor the object that's the completely non-intentional stuff, but you need an intermediate thing that he calls the flesh, and that's where intentionality resides.

392
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:35,520
Now, let me say something a little bit more about this weird phenomenon of being led without knowing, without focusing on the fact that you're being led.

393
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:48,319
I think it's something that happens all the time, and I think that it happens, another name for it in Marvel Pulsey's terminology is a phenomenon of motor intentionality.

394
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:55,279
When my eyes are being led by the lighting, it's a motor intentional phenomenon.

395
00:44:55,439 --> 00:45:00,159
That's the thing, it's a motor phenomenon, it's my eyes that are responding to the feed.

396
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,240
But it's an intentional phenomenon because there's correctness conditions.

397
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,720
They can respond to it properly or not properly.

398
00:45:06,959 --> 00:45:13,680
Explicitly, not a cognitive intentional phenomenon, but a bodily intentional phenomenon.

399
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:26,639
And there's a lot of, I think, interesting evidence, contemporary evidence from neuroscientists, that there really is a phenomenon that you might call motor intentionality.

400
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,760
And I think that you haven't talked about this explicitly.

401
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,240
Is that right?

402
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:30,880
Okay.

403
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:49,760
So, neuroscientists in the last 10 years or so have done a lot of work distinguishing the function of two different pathways in the brain, two different pathways for visual information flow in the brain.

404
00:45:49,760 --> 00:46:06,319
There's a dorsal stream path, this is the occipital cortex, this is where the visual information starts, goes into the retina, goes straight back here, and then gets fed forward either on a dorsal pathway up this way, or on a ventral pathway, that weird forced the temples.

405
00:46:07,279 --> 00:46:17,559
And people have known anatomically for about 30 years now that the information flows along these two different pathways.

406
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:27,000
But they haven't had a good sense of what the function of these two pathways is, how these two pathways treat visual information differently.

407
00:46:27,319 --> 00:46:38,439
And in the last 10 years or so, there's been a lot of work on a particular subject who had a lesion in a ventral stream of information flow.

408
00:46:39,319 --> 00:46:45,160
So this ventral stream, one of the pathways, couldn't process information in the way that it needed to.

409
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:51,560
And the only information that got processed in her went along the dorsal stream.

410
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:54,600
So this is a, neuroscientists love this kind of case.

411
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,279
It's a vocal lesion.

412
00:46:56,279 --> 00:46:59,719
It's sort of very narrow and it doesn't stop messy.

413
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:06,359
And it gives you pretty good evidence for what it would be just to have the dorsal stream pathway functioning.

414
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:11,319
So that's supposed to give you a pretty good account of what it is that the dorsal stream does.

415
00:47:11,319 --> 00:47:20,999
Now, this patient, she's known as DF in the literature, she, I think, she has a version of pure motor intentionality.

416
00:47:20,999 --> 00:47:36,760
She has a relation to the environment, by means of which the environment leads her to act in certain ways, despite the fact that she can't focus on the determinate features of the environment that are leading her to act that way.

417
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:57,880
So she can't, for us, this is not like the case that I'll tell you about, but in the lighting case, we are led to look over here in order to see the color of the wall well, despite the fact that I can't focus while I'm being led to look over here on the determinate amount of light.

418
00:47:57,879 --> 00:48:02,799
So I'm led by the light, but not in virtue of seeing it as a determinate quantity.

419
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,760
My eyes are just drawn over here to see the color well.

420
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:13,920
Well, it turns out almost all of her experience of gifts is like that.

421
00:48:13,919 --> 00:48:25,999
It's very hard for us to imagine, but DF has a deficit that's called visual form diagnosia.

422
00:48:25,999 --> 00:48:39,520
So that means that she can't see or doesn't have any knowledge of, she's without knowledge, that means bodily knowledge or perceptual knowledge, without any knowledge of visual forms, of the shapes of things.

423
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:46,160
And it's hard to imagine what it would be like not to be able to see the shapes of things.

424
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:51,840
She can see the colors of things, and she can see their texture.

425
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:57,040
To some extent, she can say how much light there is falling on a thing.

426
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:02,240
She gets luminosity information, but she can't see any of the shapes of things.

427
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:14,799
So if you ask her, you know, what shape this was, she'd be just as likely to say that it was a triangle, as a square, as a circle, as a pyramid.

428
00:49:14,799 --> 00:49:17,440
She has no idea what shape it is.

429
00:49:17,439 --> 00:49:25,600
If you ask her to draw, to look at this and copy that shape, she'd end up with, you know, something like that.

430
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:34,680
If you ask her to compare it to uh another set of shapes over here.

431
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:40,160
I'll ask her which one it's most bright, she's equally likely to answer this one as that.

432
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:47,639
And uh even more amazingly, it turns out she can't see the orientation of a line.

433
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:52,440
I mean her deficit is so extreme that she can't see the orientation of a line.

434
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:59,080
So you give her a line, you say, is this a vertical line or a horizontal line?

435
00:49:59,399 --> 00:50:00,839
Her answers are at random.

436
00:50:00,839 --> 00:50:07,080
She doesn't know whether she can't see it as a vertical line or a horizontal line.

437
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,160
And that's true.

438
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,240
It's not just a reporting problem.

439
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:17,080
It's not that she sees that it's a vertical line but just can't tell you that.

440
00:50:17,479 --> 00:50:24,920
Because they ask her in lots and lots of different ways to report it and she's completely hopeless in all of them.

441
00:50:24,919 --> 00:50:28,919
So they ask her to say what orientation lines at, can't do it.

442
00:50:28,999 --> 00:50:32,199
Ask her to turn her hand so that it lines up with the orientation.

443
00:50:32,359 --> 00:50:33,160
Can't do it.

444
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:37,240
Turn a knob that's got a a dial that's got a line on it.

445
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,360
She can't do it.

446
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,760
She can't report it in any way.

447
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:45,399
And that leads them to believe that she doesn't really see it as in one orientation or another.

448
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:51,640
But it turns out she can act differentially with respect to it.

449
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:56,440
And I think this is a pure form of motor intentional activity.

450
00:50:56,439 --> 00:51:16,040
So if you take a piece of plywood like this and you put a slot in it, a rectangular slot, and no, not just a picture of a piece of plywood, but a real thing, and you put her about an arm's length away and you say, well, there's a piece of plywood with a slot in it, and your hand fits through the slot nicely.

451
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,959
What I want you to do is to post your hand through the slot.

452
00:51:20,279 --> 00:51:24,040
It turns out she's about 98% accurate.

453
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:28,279
It turns out that you put it at zero degrees, boom, she does it this way.

454
00:51:28,279 --> 00:51:32,560
Put it at 45 degrees, she does it that way, 90 degrees, does it that way?

455
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:43,279
So here's a case of a subject who can be led to act in a certain way with respect to features of the environment.

456
00:51:43,279 --> 00:51:48,560
She can be drawn by the environment to perform differential activities.

457
00:51:48,560 --> 00:52:01,279
Despite the fact that she can't, doesn't have any determinate focus, doesn't have any determinate awareness of what those features in the environment law are that are leading her to act that way.

458
00:52:01,279 --> 00:52:09,839
That seems to me very much what Meloponty is after when he describes the way the lighting leads the gaze.

459
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:20,960
I don't have a determinate experience of how much light there is, just as she doesn't have a determinate experience of what orientation the slot is in.

460
00:52:20,959 --> 00:52:33,840
But nevertheless, I find myself being led to act in a certain way, rather than some different way, in the presence of that light when given a task that involves it, that involves my taking it into account.

461
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:46,880
So this kind of motor intentional activity, it seems to me, is something that's crucial in Melopoli's account of the perceptual constancies.

462
00:52:47,200 --> 00:53:15,760
Because it seems to me that what Meloponty thinks is that the way we experience the background features, like the lighting context, or the distance to an object, or the angle of presentation of a shape of an object, is in terms of how well they allow me to focus on the size or the shape or the color of the thing I'm trying to focus on.

463
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:27,879
And that, and I experience that, I experience how well I experience this normative fact just by being drawn to act motor intentionally in one way or another.

464
00:53:28,359 --> 00:53:47,879
Seems to me that's what Merlot Pulti is after when he says that the way I experience the lighting, when I experience it as the environment, not as an object itself, is in terms of how well it leads me, or in terms of how it leads me to the place where I can see the color best.

465
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:57,720
Well, by no explicit grasp of the environment, I mean no grasp of the environment in its determinate features.

466
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:10,839
So an explicit grasp, the intellectualist who we talked about before, posits some understanding of the distance to the object as a determinate quantity, like the real estate age.

467
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:21,560
And Merlin Polti says, no, it's true about taking into account the distance to the picture in the art museum, but I'm not taking it, I don't experience it as a determinate quantity.

468
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:24,200
I experience it indeterminately.

469
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:30,680
And my reading of what it means that he says I experience it indeterminately is that what he says about the lighting.

470
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:37,399
I experience it as leading me to do this, that, and the next thing in order to focus on the picture.

471
00:54:37,799 --> 00:54:40,279
So indeterminately just means not determinately.

472
00:54:40,279 --> 00:54:41,799
It doesn't help us much.

473
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,879
What we really mean, I think, is normatively.

474
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,519
That's a better way to say it.

475
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:51,560
The way in which I take it into account in my experience is by being led by it.

476
00:54:53,319 --> 00:54:59,120
The way in which it is taken into account, that's outside of the scope of what I'm experiencing, right?

477
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:02,319
Is that I'm experience myself being led.

478
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:02,879
Yeah.

479
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:04,479
DF and Schneider have.

480
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,720
Well, Schneider was a much more complicated case.

481
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:14,080
Schneider has been shot up in World War I.

482
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:17,520
And so his lesions were not particularly focal.

483
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:31,760
But I think that Merlopoltzy is trying to focus on the distinction that's clearer in the case of DF between what you get in roughly what you get in ventral streams.

484
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:47,600
When about Schneider, he has the discussion around page 98 in my book, the discussion in chapter 3 of the spatiality of lungs on body.

485
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:49,839
And so it's 112.

486
00:55:50,479 --> 00:55:53,360
98 is the beginning of the chapter.

487
00:55:55,600 --> 00:56:01,839
When he talks there about the difference between pointing and grasping, and that's where he introduces Schneider.

488
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:08,560
And he says, look, the interesting thing about Schneider is that he can grasp things, but he can't really point at them.

489
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:19,920
So, and Merlopolti thinks the difference between grasping and pointing is that grasping is what he calls a concrete activity and pointing is an abstract activity.

490
00:56:19,919 --> 00:56:26,319
Grasping is what you do when you're already brought up into the context, tied up in the context.

491
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:30,880
So, and DF can grasp things.

492
00:56:30,879 --> 00:56:31,399
DF.

493
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:37,040
can form a grasp that's appropriate to the size and shape of the thing that she's picking up.

494
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,040
She can pick things up perfectly well.

495
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,120
You ask her to pick up a coffee mug, no problem.

496
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:41,839
She picks it up.

497
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:43,999
You ask her to pick up the bread knife, no problem.

498
00:56:43,999 --> 00:56:44,720
She picks it up.

499
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,319
She might pick it up from the wrong end.

500
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,999
There's something funny about that.

501
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:52,520
She doesn't seem to be able to see its function.

502
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:57,400
But she picks it up perfectly efficiently in such a way that she won't drop it.

503
00:56:57,399 --> 00:56:59,080
And Schneider can do that too.

504
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,760
That's the sense in which D.F.

505
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,279
and Schneider are similar.

506
00:57:02,279 --> 00:57:04,200
Schneider can also do that.

507
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,879
What Schneider can't do is point at things.

508
00:57:07,879 --> 00:57:09,079
That's what Merlin Paul T.

509
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:09,639
talks about.

510
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:13,240
I mean, that's one of the many things he can't do, is point at things.

511
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:20,440
And I think that's a little bit like the fact that DF can't make judgments about the sizes and shapes of things.

512
00:57:20,439 --> 00:57:24,120
So there's some similarity, but DF is a sort of updated case.

513
00:57:24,919 --> 00:57:26,200
Somewhere in the back, and I'm going to.

514
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:36,999
Ah, about DF.

515
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:50,279
Well, there is no intellectualist, cognitive scientist story yet about DF because the kinds of stories that you get are the stories that cognitive neuroscientists give.

516
00:57:50,279 --> 00:58:05,559
And these are the nice thing about the cognitive neuroscientists is that they tend not to have much I might not take this back, but they tend not to have much sort of high-level theoretical faggot.

517
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:10,440
Really what they're trying to do is figure out what things she can and can't do.

518
00:58:10,839 --> 00:58:14,439
So they're so they're doing all sorts of experiments, and this was one of them.

519
00:58:14,439 --> 00:58:15,720
They did this experiment.

520
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:24,760
They try to figure out what kinds of things she can and can't do without trying to explain why it is that she can and can't do them, except for the fact that, well, she's got lesions here and not there.

521
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:35,360
So they don't have the kind of high-level psychological theoretical apparatus that's, according to the phenomenologist, likely to mislead them.

522
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:37,120
They've just got the data.

523
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:44,720
And they think, well, okay, so now what we're learning is what the dorsal stream allows you to do and what as opposed to what the ventral stream allows you to do.

524
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:52,080
Without giving a further story at a sort of higher level of abstraction, which is what the psychologist wants, that explains that.

525
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,959
Sooner or later, no doubt, they'll get their hands on it.

526
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:56,399
Yeah.

527
00:58:58,479 --> 00:59:00,960
I can tell you one thing, and this is interesting.

528
00:59:00,959 --> 00:59:16,960
You could, and most of the cognitive neuroscientists who work with DF do, you could sort of take all this stuff that she does and find it really interesting and lay it out and still buy into Marvel Fulty's account of motor intentionality.

529
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,880
Here's the easy way to do it.

530
00:59:18,879 --> 00:59:24,240
You just say, well, when she's posting her hands through the slot, totally unconscious.

531
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,760
It has nothing to do with her at all.

532
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,080
It's not intentional in any way.

533
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,079
It's just a motor reflex.

534
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,959
I guess that's maybe what you're looking for.

535
00:59:33,439 --> 00:59:35,119
And there is a big issue there.

536
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:55,040
I mean, I've talked to them a lot, and it's very hard to get them to notice that this ought to push you to think that there's need for a category that's somewhere between the motor reflex, the non-intentional motor reflex category, and the fully cognitive and sort of regular old intentionality category.

537
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:58,559
That it really ought to be a category in between that's called motor intentionality.

538
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,319
They just think, no, no, it's just the reflex.

539
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:01,999
It's just she's totally unconscious of it.

540
01:00:01,999 --> 01:00:05,519
She doesn't have any sense of what she's doing.

541
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,799
She doesn't have any awareness.

542
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:08,399
There are no correctness conditions.

543
01:00:08,279 --> 01:00:13,040
It's just, it's like having your kneecap tapped and your foot going up.

544
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,239
That's the, yeah.

545
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:19,399
And they do think that the dorsal stream, so this is another way of saying it.

546
01:00:19,399 --> 01:00:36,600
They do, one of the ways they chop it up is they say that means that the ventral stream gives you conscious information, information that could serve as input to perceptual judgments about size and shape and color, whereas the dorsal stream is just reflexes and just tells you, it just makes your body move in certain ways.

547
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:39,479
That's the other, the good, that's a helpful clarification.

548
01:00:39,479 --> 01:00:39,799
Yeah, right.

549
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:51,399
So like along these lines of things like verbal findings trying to be anticipated is possible because there it is this problem of either empiricist feel or the intellectual steel or a high movie.

550
01:00:51,399 --> 01:00:51,720
Yeah.

551
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:53,799
And there it's like along these lines.

552
01:00:53,799 --> 01:00:58,279
What I wanted to ask was what's the relation between motor intentionality and consciousness?

553
01:00:58,839 --> 01:01:08,359
And depending on what that relation is, is it really accurate to say that DF is a case of pure motor intentionality rather than deformed motor intentionality.

554
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,559
Right, okay, good.

555
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:23,240
I mean, it might be that any case of pure motor intentionality is a case of deformed motor intentionality, just because it's not motor intentionality that serves as the background for the rest of our conscious life, but motor intentionality full stop.

556
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:26,839
And so that maybe that's what you're pushing on.

557
01:01:26,839 --> 01:01:28,839
Well, that way you're creating all those things with pensioners.

558
01:01:28,839 --> 01:01:30,359
I don't think I misunderstood what you said.

559
01:01:30,839 --> 01:01:34,200
What I want to highlight is perhaps there is something qualitatively different.

560
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:34,519
Yeah.

561
01:01:36,439 --> 01:01:37,080
Yeah.

562
01:01:37,399 --> 01:01:40,120
And if there is something qualitatively different, then GF is.

563
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:47,319
I think I, well, she is messed up, and I think she tells us something about motor intentionality, but this is a good issue.

564
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:48,600
This is a good issue.

565
01:01:49,399 --> 01:01:51,480
Here's what I think I can say about it.

566
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:58,440
Here's a way in which DF is messed up, in which this isn't really a very good case.

567
01:01:58,999 --> 01:02:11,520
The way I described the phenomenon of the lighting leading the gaze was that you had to make sure you weren't focused on it, on the lighting, in order for it to do its job properly.

568
01:02:11,999 --> 01:02:14,720
So it's always got to be in the background.

569
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:21,439
And what it is for it to be in the background is in some sense for me to be taking account of it, but not focused on it.

570
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:35,599
Now, there's a sort of sense in which when DF is consciously engaged in this activity of following the instructions, post your hands through the slots, it's not exactly an activity that's in the background.

571
01:02:35,999 --> 01:02:39,040
That is the activity that she's trying to perform.

572
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:46,880
It's just that it may be that the way she has to perform it is by not focusing, for instance, on what her arm is doing.

573
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,080
She can sometimes focus on what her arm is doing.

574
01:02:50,879 --> 01:03:01,120
There are these stories about how one of the ways they asked her to record the orientation of the slot was by turning her hand so that it lined up with the orientation of the slot.

575
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:10,319
And she came after a lot of trials to notice that she was really good at posting her hands through the slots, but she wasn't so good at just turning her hand so that it lined up with the slot.

576
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:16,960
She got frustrated, and when they asked her to line her hand up with the slot, she'd do something like this.

577
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,240
Sort of like that.

578
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:22,160
In other words, she'd try to post it, and it would end up about that.

579
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,680
She wouldn't go all the way through and say, yeah, I guess that's about right.

580
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:35,120
So she could come to focus on the act, can come to focus on the activity, but it's supposed to be this thing that's going on while it's not the thing that you're paying attention to.

581
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:39,360
It's not the thing that you're doing as a task.

582
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:50,439
I focused on the task of seeing the color of the wall when the lighting's leading my gaze, where she seems to be focused on the very task that's supposed to be the example of motor intentional activity.

583
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:54,519
That's a bad, I mean, that's a disanalogy.

584
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:56,439
Maybe there was something else that you're thinking of.

585
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,879
He did my original question, like, like, where is consciousness from the end?

586
01:03:59,959 --> 01:04:00,279
Oh, right.

587
01:04:03,879 --> 01:04:07,879
And in re-reading this, it seems like Milo Ponchi really wants to reduce that.

588
01:04:07,879 --> 01:04:12,359
And he does talk about consciousness in a way which is both problematic but perhaps informative.

589
01:04:12,359 --> 01:04:15,959
But here's cases where it really does matter that you're conscious.

590
01:04:15,959 --> 01:04:16,359
Yeah.

591
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,839
I mean, we're organizing these panels.

592
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:19,799
Yeah, good.

593
01:04:19,799 --> 01:04:27,079
The way I say it, and the way Melopolchi says it sometimes, let's see, I was just, I did find a passage where he says something.

594
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,480
I think I read a passage where he says something like this.

595
01:04:29,479 --> 01:04:38,680
The way I say it, usually, and I think this is a phrase that Meloponci uses, or that maybe Gervich uses it too, it needs to occur at the margins of awareness.

596
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:42,199
It's something that we're not focused on, but it's still part of our awareness.

597
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:45,480
Now, how can you tell that it's still part of our awareness?

598
01:04:45,479 --> 01:04:48,679
Well, I take it here's one way you can tell.

599
01:04:49,479 --> 01:04:56,520
If it turned out, I mean, here's a motor intentional activity, you and I are walking along, and I reach out to grab the doorknob.

600
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:03,000
And one of Bert's favorite ones, that I reach out to grab the doorknob, and my grip forms itself to the shape of the doorknob.

601
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:05,399
If it's a handle like that, I do one thing.

602
01:05:05,479 --> 01:05:07,960
If it's a knob like this, I do a different thing.

603
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:11,720
But I'm not paying attention to the fact that I'm doing it.

604
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:15,400
But it's part of my awareness in the following sense.

605
01:05:15,399 --> 01:05:28,439
If all of a sudden, everything went black, and I went from being here to standing at the door with my hand on the doorknob, that's what it would be like for none of that activity to be part of my awareness at all.

606
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:31,919
That's what it would be momentarily to become a zombie.

607
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:42,879
So there's some sense in which my activity of walking towards the doorknob and reaching out to grab it is part of that's something that I'm taking account of.

608
01:05:42,879 --> 01:05:45,199
It's something that's at the margins of my awareness.

609
01:05:45,199 --> 01:05:50,159
It's not completely absent because if it were, it wouldn't make any difference to me if all of a sudden I were there.

610
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:54,879
There's something that's part of my awareness, but it's not something that I'm focused on.

611
01:05:54,879 --> 01:05:55,760
I'm not paying attention.

612
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:56,560
I couldn't do that.

613
01:05:56,560 --> 01:06:02,159
I could pay attention to where my feet are going and how my hand is forming its grasp and so on and so forth.

614
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:07,999
So the way that Megalovi says it, the way I think it's right to stand, is that it's at the margins of awareness.

615
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:43,279
Let me say one other thing, I don't know where I have another question or two, but one other thing is this really interesting fact that these kinds of motor intentional activities, these ways that our body has of taking account of features of the environment, are apparently things, activities that can, if we learn to pay attention to them in the right way, can give us determinate information about the environment.

616
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,479
It's very rare.

617
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,959
But this is the case that I'm thinking of.

618
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,440
Does everybody know what blindsight is?

619
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,879
What the phenomenon of blindsight is?

620
01:06:50,879 --> 01:07:00,879
Blindsight is a phenomenon where it usually happens in one hemifield, in one half of the visual field, and you get it as a result of a stroke or a certain kind of lesion.

621
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:08,559
And so blindsiders have no experience of the right half of their visual, of things in the right half of their visual field.

622
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:12,879
And yet, they can make judgments about what's there.

623
01:07:12,879 --> 01:07:19,879
You say to them, there's either an X or an O over here in the right half of your visual field.

624
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:21,720
What do you think it is?

625
01:07:21,879 --> 01:07:27,480
Now they have no experience at all, and so they say, well, geez, I don't know, I can't see it, Doc.

626
01:07:27,959 --> 01:07:29,239
How am I supposed to know?

627
01:07:29,239 --> 01:07:30,680
And you say, no, guess.

628
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:31,799
Take a guess.

629
01:07:31,799 --> 01:07:37,720
And when they guess, they turn out to be very accurate, sometimes as much as 90, 95% accurate.

630
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:41,560
Now, it turns out, so that's the canonical case of blindsight.

631
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:45,079
It turns out there's two different kinds, though, of blindsight.

632
01:07:45,079 --> 01:08:00,039
That one is called type 1 blind sight, and there's another called type 2 blind sight, where the crucial difference is that for type 2 blindsiders, they say, well, I'll tell you what, Doc, you say, there's an X or an O there, what do you think it is?

633
01:08:00,039 --> 01:08:04,680
And they say, well, I'll tell you what, Doc, I can't see anything over there.

634
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,720
But god darn it, I got a hunch.

635
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:11,640
I sort of have a sense, and I think it's an X.

636
01:08:11,959 --> 01:08:16,039
And they're just as accurate, sometimes more accurate than the type 1 blindsiders.

637
01:08:16,039 --> 01:08:24,199
But the big difference is that although they don't have any visual experience of what's going on in the blind half of the visual field, they have a hunch.

638
01:08:24,199 --> 01:08:25,159
They have a feeling.

639
01:08:25,159 --> 01:08:25,959
They have a get.

640
01:08:26,839 --> 01:08:28,199
It's not just a guess.

641
01:08:29,239 --> 01:08:31,959
It feels like this is the right thing to say.

642
01:08:31,959 --> 01:08:42,600
And one of the explanations for what's going on is that usually the type 2 blindsiders are subjects who've been blindsided for a long time.

643
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,760
They've had this problem for a long time.

644
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:56,279
And one of the explanations is that your eyes respond differently when they're presented with a sort of smooth, round thing than when they're presented with a jagged, too-crossed thing.

645
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:59,079
So your eyes deal with the object differently.

646
01:08:59,079 --> 01:09:04,879
That's supposed to be a motor-intentional fact, something that happens without your paying attention to the fact that it's happening.

647
01:09:05,199 --> 01:09:23,999
And the suggestion is that the type 2 insiders get this hunch about what's in the environment because they somehow learn to pay attention, even if not explicitly, they somehow learn to pay attention to what their eyes are doing for them in response to the presentation of something in the environment.

648
01:09:23,999 --> 01:09:37,919
Now, that's the kind of thing where you may not, they're aware in that case, if this account is right, this is a life-highness account, they're aware in that case of what their eyes are doing for them, though not because they're paying attention to where their eyes are going.

649
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,600
They're just sort of, it's at the margin.

650
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,199
They don't even, they wouldn't even say that.

651
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:41,999
Okay.

652
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:43,119
All right.

653
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:45,680
Well, I'll say my punchline then.

654
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:53,519
We have a story about the way in which the background is present to us in our experience of the figure.

655
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:58,799
Now there's a question: how is it that the figure is present to us?

656
01:09:58,799 --> 01:10:10,239
So if it's really true that the way I take account of the lighting when I focused on the color is in terms of how it leads me to focus on the thing, then you'd like to know, how is it that I experience the color?

657
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:13,359
We know what the background, what the experience of the background is like.

658
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,760
So what's the experience of the figure then?

659
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:22,079
The amazing thing is that I think Merloponci gets this right exactly once.

660
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:25,600
And he gets it wrong most of the rest of the time.

661
01:10:26,079 --> 01:10:30,239
But I think everything in his view leads him to this account.

662
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:31,360
And so I'm going to read it.

663
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,600
Now I'm on page 305.

664
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:39,760
On 305, he says, the long paragraph.

665
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,600
It starts with the qualities of the thing.

666
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,359
It's color, for example.

667
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:46,919
But I'm about a page and a half into that.

668
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:48,680
Below the Mowories.

669
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:50,680
The Mowories have 3,000 names of colors.

670
01:10:52,919 --> 01:11:03,559
Okay, so the Maoris have 3,000 names of colors, he says, not because they perceive a great many, but on the contrary, because they fail to identify them when they belong to objects structurally different from each other.

671
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:11,319
The woolly blue for them isn't the same, or the woolly red isn't the same as the shiny red of the fire engine, the woolly red of the carpet.

672
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:15,879
They have a different name for the woolly red of the carpet than for the shiny red of the fire engine.

673
01:11:16,199 --> 01:11:21,319
As Taylor puts it, perception goes straight to the thing and bypasses the color.

674
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:31,720
But we shall not succeed in understanding perception unless we take into account a color function which may remain even when the qualitative appearance is modified.

675
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:34,999
That's just a statement of the color conferency effect.

676
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:40,600
Even though the lighting conditions change, the color seems to be the same.

677
01:11:40,919 --> 01:11:48,999
I say that my fountain pen is black, and I see it as black under the sun's rays, but also in the electric lighting of the room.

678
01:11:48,999 --> 01:11:59,479
But this blackness, the way I experience the real color, the real constant color of the fountain pen, is less the sensible quality of blackness.

679
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:09,079
It's not something that you see the way you might see a color chip or something, or a qualia in the contemporary philosophy of minds sense.

680
01:12:09,079 --> 01:12:19,319
It's less the sensible quality of blackness than a somber power which radiates from the object even when it's overlaid with reflected light.

681
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:23,879
And it's visible only in the sense in which moral blackness is visible.

682
01:12:23,879 --> 01:12:29,640
It's not something you can focus on, but it's something that you can see when presented with it, nevertheless.

683
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:44,319
Then, this is the important sentence: the real color, the real constant color that I see an object to be throughout variations in lighting persists beneath appearances as the background persists beneath the figure.

684
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:50,720
So, the real color itself is experienced as a background, not as a figure.

685
01:12:50,959 --> 01:12:57,519
That is not as a seen or thought-of quality, but through a non-sensory presence.

686
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:58,879
So, what does he mean by that?

687
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:01,919
Let's try the case of size constancy.

688
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:17,839
What it is to experience the size of this object as constant throughout variations in my distance to it is for me constantly to be taking into account the distance to it by automatically being drawn to walk closer or further away to see what?

689
01:13:17,839 --> 01:13:23,360
Well, to see that size well, well, what does it mean to see that size well?

690
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,999
All I ever get is an appearance of it at this distance.

691
01:13:25,999 --> 01:13:38,559
Well, the way in which I experience the size is as that thing that's better presented when I get closer to it and a little worse presented when I get further away from it.

692
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:47,600
It's itself not something that I can focus on, but something in terms of which I experience any particular presentation of the size.

693
01:13:47,600 --> 01:14:06,079
So, to, with color, what it is to experience the color of this wall as a particular shade of light is to experience it as that shade which is, well, not so well presented over here, but uh-huh, it's better presented over here and a little better over here, and so on and so forth.

694
01:14:06,079 --> 01:14:22,199
So, the real constant color or shape or size of an object is itself something like the background against which I experience any particular presentation of the size or shape or color.

695
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:29,319
And I mentioned that I think he gets it right in this sentence and wrong in lots of other places in the in the book.

696
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:31,559
Here's one way to get it wrong.

697
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:40,279
You might think that the real color is just a color as I see it to be when I'm looking at the at the best at the place where it's best lit.

698
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:45,640
But that's not really what Maria Polki ought to say, though he does say it sometimes.

699
01:14:45,640 --> 01:15:08,600
What he ought to say is, no, that's a case where I experience the current presentation of the colour to be, well, a presentation that doesn't deviate very much from what the real color is, maybe doesn't even deviate at all, but nonetheless isn't the real color itself, because the real color has all these projectable properties.

700
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:13,799
It's the thing against that allows me to understand any particular presentation.

701
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:16,199
Isn't this another right statement of it?

702
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,439
We have a 352.

703
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:19,879
I'm going to tell you where you live.

704
01:15:20,119 --> 01:15:22,439
I'm seeing on 20302.

705
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:22,919
Okay.

706
01:15:23,079 --> 01:15:28,919
The middle of 352, the distance from me to the object is not a size which increases or decreases.

707
01:15:29,159 --> 01:15:31,959
Yeah, a tension which fluctuates around a normal.

708
01:15:31,959 --> 01:15:34,279
Well, that's what no, uh no.

709
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:34,999
No.

710
01:15:34,999 --> 01:15:40,600
But that's, I mean, it is what I've been saying until the until you asked me to give the punchline.

711
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:46,039
The distance from me to the object is not a size which increases or decreases, but a tension which fluctuates around a norm.

712
01:15:46,199 --> 01:15:52,039
That's a story about how I experience the distance, not a story about how I experience the size presented at me.

713
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:53,479
Yes, absolutely.

714
01:15:53,879 --> 01:15:54,600
That is the punchline.

715
01:15:55,159 --> 01:15:55,959
That is the punchline.

716
01:15:56,039 --> 01:15:56,440
Yeah, yeah.

717
01:15:56,760 --> 01:16:00,480
But this is not I mean, this is just about the distance, not about the size presented out over it.

718
01:16:00,959 --> 01:16:01,360
Okay, thanks.

719
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,239
Okay, good.

720
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:03,359
Thank you guys very much.
