00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
Okay, so now we're ready to deal with the chapter.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:16,839
First, I'm going to give you an overview of what I think the outline is, which I seldom do, only because I never can tell what the outline is, but this time it seems pretty clear.

3
00:00:17,159 --> 00:00:34,919
So there are three features of human being understood as a Cartesian cogito, as an I think, that Meloponty wants to deny applies for motor intention.

4
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,799
It turns out they also deny that they apply.

5
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,599
It turns out he wants to deny that they even apply for reflection.

6
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:52,120
So there's just never a time when it's appropriate to think of us as an I think.

7
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:58,839
Now, of course, until I tell you what it is to think of yourself as an I think, you can't just tell by the words that it's inappropriate.

8
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:03,240
You could be pretty sure these days that somebody says it's Cartesian, that's an info.

9
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,599
But what's the inappropriate thing?

10
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:14,680
Well, three claims about the cogito that go back to Descartes are being denied.

11
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,159
The first one is the indubitability.

12
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,560
So then comes a lot of talk, interesting epistemological talk.

13
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,920
The basic point being that even though I can't be certain about the objects of the...

14
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,320
This is the claim that he's against them, the indubitability claim.

15
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:39,160
That even though I can't be certain about the objects of my consciousness, I can be certain about what I seem to see and seem to feel.

16
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,320
That's what Descartes says in the meditations.

17
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:47,240
I don't know whether I'm going to dead or not, but it certainly seems like I am, and I can't be wrong about that.

18
00:01:47,959 --> 00:02:10,640
So, and there's going to be a discussion of perception and how it's not understandable as having a seeming to see, indubitable aspect, and of love as the claim that feelings also don't have an indubitable.

19
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:21,199
Somehow, seeming to see and seeming to love are not the epistemologically basic, indubitable sense data.

20
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:33,760
And the anti-claim is, my experience of objects and feelings can be certain, but even when they're certain, they're not indubitable.

21
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,640
Even when they're certain, we might have to take them back.

22
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,600
That's an interesting and strange-sounding claim, but that's what he's going to argue.

23
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:47,440
He and Austin have this view at least, and maybe a lot of other people too.

24
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,560
Second, transparency.

25
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,080
I mean, I like the first one because I understand pretty clearly what the position is and what his objection is.

26
00:02:56,079 --> 00:03:06,000
The next one is sort of not terribly clear to me, but it's roughly that I can be exhaustively aware of the contents of my thought.

27
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:07,280
In fact, stronger.

28
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,359
I must be exhaustively aware of the contents of my thought.

29
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:12,720
That's how thought is.

30
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,959
It's my thought, and I know it.

31
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,680
That's why it's my thought.

32
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:30,959
And the way he deals with that is, he says it's refuted in even in the most sort of abstract kind of thinking like geometry, which ought to be a good case of transparency.

33
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:38,600
When I'm thinking about a triangle, I ought to be completely clear about what a triangle is, what its essential structure is, how could I be otherwise.

34
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:41,839
When he wants to say I could be otherwise.

35
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:59,560
And the argument is, I think, that all thinking, even formalizing, as in geometry, takes place and makes sense only on the background of a bodily Richel and a history of the concepts involved, both of which I can't get clear about.

36
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:08,760
So thinking is never transparent because it has a background of untransparency to make it possible.

37
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,040
And reflection is the third thing.

38
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,880
The cogito is a kind of reflection, but he has nothing against reflection.

39
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:31,000
The misleading thing about the cogito is that it assumes that, in Kantian terms, the I think can accompany any experience.

40
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,199
For years, I wondered what really that meant, whether I was for it or against it.

41
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:39,959
Now I understand what it means, I think, and I'm definitely against it.

42
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:46,040
What it means is you can reflect on any of your experiences and that won't change them.

43
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:59,959
So that when you discover a reflective experience, you can be sure that you didn't produce it by reflecting, but that every experience can be reflected on and still stay what it was.

44
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:02,040
That view he thinks is wrong.

45
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,280
Reflection radically transforms your experience.

46
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,160
So it's not a, you don't want to deny reflection.

47
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:22,680
You want to deny reflection as a way of getting undistorted access to the content of your mind, receiving and thinking.

48
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,360
And what's the argument?

49
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:33,760
I think it's that reflection transforms motor intentionality by introducing a subject-object distinction, which wasn't there.

50
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:44,000
And in that way, it denies the third kind of being, the openness to the world, which is transformed by reflection.

51
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:48,720
because on reflection you think that these are all your private experiences that you're having.

52
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:54,720
And at least that's the kind of reflection Cartesians and Kantians get you into.

53
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:57,199
And my favorite teacher, C.I.

54
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:07,280
Lewis, which I used to talk all the time about, that here-now predicament, that all I'm ever experiencing is what I'm experiencing right now here.

55
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,120
Of course, that's not what you really find.

56
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:17,520
That's not what's really going on, but that's how it looks on some kind of philosophical reflection.

57
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:17,839
Yeah.

58
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,719
Is this about the same as those?

59
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,480
Exactly the same.

60
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,280
Exactly.

61
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,320
And of course, Searle is a student of Austin's.

62
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:38,959
And I just discovered, to my amazement and amusement, we'll get to this about Austin, how Austin can make a distinction between being certain in perception and that being indubitable, what's the Searle term?

63
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:40,480
Incorrigibility.

64
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,800
That's just another term for the same thing.

65
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,119
That certainty doesn't imply incorrigibility, oddly enough.

66
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:51,360
You can be certain and wrong.

67
00:06:51,359 --> 00:07:07,120
And I was saying how interestingly that sounds like Austin when happened to have Charles Taylor around and said, oh, I remember the day when Austin called me in and said, I'll give you one afternoon to explain Merlot-Ponty to a group of students.

68
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:09,599
So Taylor explained Merlot-Ponty.

69
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:17,000
Now, I don't know whether he explained this before or after Austin wrote sense and sensibilia, but I imagine it was before.

70
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:31,400
And it's part of my general view that every time anything in Anglo-philosophy sounds like Merillo-Ponty, it is Merlot-Ponty, and it challenged, channeled to them by Charles Taylor under some kind of analytic description.

71
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,720
I'm not really convinced it's true, but it's a nice idea.

72
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,800
And one more example there.

73
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,839
Of course, the non-conceptual content thing that's all over the place.

74
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:51,079
That comes from Charles Taylor, handed over to Gareth Evans, handed over to a whole bunch of other Anglo-philosophers who now worry about non-conceptual content.

75
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:59,239
So Merlot-Ponty, it's no accident that Merillo-Ponty right now seems to be where it's at, because these are his problems.

76
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:04,120
Okay, anything else, or should we plunge into the perception quickness?

77
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:04,280
Yeah.

78
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,120
Is that what Cyril says he's doing?

79
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:12,760
I don't know.

80
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,280
Well, did I say that?

81
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:14,680
No.

82
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,199
I see.

83
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,320
Okay.

84
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,320
Certainty from an object.

85
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,719
That's not quite the way to put it.

86
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,400
Well, why don't I do it?

87
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,600
And then you tell me.

88
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,600
I'm going to lay out what he thinks.

89
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:37,960
He's certainly got epistemic and ontological aspects, what he thinks, but whether certainty gets switched, I don't know.

90
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:39,800
Tell me later.

91
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,479
Or maybe I'll discover it.

92
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:43,880
Anything else?

93
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:44,520
Okay.

94
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:49,080
So now we're into the perception and feeling.

95
00:08:49,079 --> 00:09:12,800
Those are the first two on my list, as test cases of this question of Kogito, I think, and where I think is something inner and private and indubitable and incorrigible and transparent, which is closely related.

96
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,119
I think you see what sense data are incorrigible, but not transparent.

97
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:34,640
They're incorrigible just because they're sort of minimally given and they don't supposedly, you can get your experience so organized that you don't imply anything, and therefore it can't be wrong.

98
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:41,040
Now, that kind of encourages can't be wrong.

99
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:50,480
The kind of incorrigibility of your thoughts are again, can't be wrong, but that's not because they don't imply anything.

100
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:51,839
They imply lots.

101
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:57,599
But that's because you're clear about all they imply so that you can't be mistaken about them.

102
00:09:57,599 --> 00:10:02,400
So two different issues, but let's put the thought one aside.

103
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:18,639
In a case of feeling and perception, the idea is that there is some inner, pure, psychic content that you can have in perception and in psychic states, like love.

104
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:21,040
There's two psychic states, love and will.

105
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:23,199
I'm not going to say much about the will one.

106
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,560
I don't understand the will one.

107
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:27,199
I'll say something about it when we get to it.

108
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,959
Partly because of a mistranslation that it's up when the time comes.

109
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,440
Okay, let's go to perception.

110
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,239
So on page 438, we get the overview.

111
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,479
And I've got, well, you've got, how many people have the other book?

112
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,399
Because I happen to have all of them, both page numbers.

113
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:51,719
Okay, well, 377 in the old version, 438 in this version.

114
00:10:52,040 --> 00:11:00,199
What I can't tell you is where on the page in the old version, but where it is on the page in the new version is the bottom half of the page.

115
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,919
I'm just going to read that all and explain it as I go.

116
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:14,119
Vision is an action, not that it is an external operation, but an operation which fulfills more than it promises.

117
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,320
What did I say?

118
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:16,839
I did?

119
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,359
How weird.

120
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:19,320
Eternal.

121
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:19,959
Yeah.

122
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,599
Okay.

123
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,200
Let's try that again.

124
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,520
Vision is an action, not that it is an eternal operation, which is a contradiction in terms.

125
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,879
Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

126
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:30,919
Because if it was an operation, it would be sort of out of time.

127
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:33,240
If it was eternal, it would be out of time.

128
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,839
And then never mind, that's totally a throwaway thing.

129
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:48,520
But an operation which fulfills more than it promises, which constantly outruns its premises, and is inwardly prepared only by my primordial opening upon a field of transcendence.

130
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,959
So keep in mind, I mean, this so it won't be mysterious.

131
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:55,239
This is all a question of what it is to see an object.

132
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,639
And when you see an object, take the house again.

133
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:15,879
There's more to it than you have ever you're going to ever be able to see because it's part of a field of stuff that's independent of you and has all sorts of characteristics independent of you.

134
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:30,879
Don't and in indefinitely more and and and more, but more more characteristics and they're also more holistically interconnected with everything else that you could ever get it clear grasp of.

135
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:34,639
So that is it's an ex stas, he gets that from Heidegger.

136
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,800
And that's another name for being an open head turned toward the world.

137
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,959
It's another name for transcendence.

138
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:46,479
It's all this business of I get outside of myself in my mind.

139
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,599
I perceive in the actual thing.

140
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:51,359
We've gone through this.

141
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:59,839
From a perspective, but that doesn't mean that somehow that I've got a perspective of it in my mind.

142
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,520
My perspective is my openness on the thing.

143
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,200
But that's just obvious by now, I hope.

144
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:11,280
Kind of achieved and fulfilled itself in the thing seen.

145
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:19,919
It is of its essence to take a hold upon itself, and indeed if it did not do so, it would not be the sight of anything.

146
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:27,920
But it is nonetheless, and this is mysterious, and that's the, by the way, that little phrase is about what he comes back to at the end.

147
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,839
I don't expect to get there today, the tacit cogito.

148
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,720
But I should say right away so you won't get confused.

149
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,320
He thinks there's some truth in the idea of the cogito.

150
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,920
It's just not at all a Cartesian I think.

151
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:52,719
But there's some sense in which we must be aware of ourselves as a field of experience when we are a field of experience.

152
00:13:52,720 --> 00:14:00,880
Now but that's it and that means it is of its essence to take hold upon itself, and if it didn't be so, it wouldn't be the sight of anything.

153
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:05,120
I mean, if it weren't a field of experience, it wouldn't be an experience.

154
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:08,000
I mean, this is I this is totally vague now.

155
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,560
How he's going to deal with that later.

156
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:10,880
Yeah.

157
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,639
Oh, well, Kant, those are holding your influence.

158
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,720
You all Heidegger again, oncendence.

159
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,079
Are there other people?

160
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,280
Wow, that's a good paper topic for example.

161
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:20,599
Thank you.

162
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:22,439
That qualifying exam question.

163
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:24,440
No, every one of them is totally different, I think.

164
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:29,480
So let's go through them because some of you all have experienced them.

165
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,919
So let's start.

166
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:38,520
Transcendent, well, notice, by the way, don't confuse transcendence and transcendental.

167
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,359
Lots of confusion is generated by them.

168
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:51,239
When Kant says transcendental, he means, he defines it as the condition of the possibility of experiencing objects.

169
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,999
And transcendent for Kant means something outside the mind.

170
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,560
So that's not totally different than Merlot-Ponty.

171
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:12,439
Except that for Merlot-Ponty, when he says transcendence, he means the way, he doesn't mean a transcendent entity outside the mind.

172
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:20,440
He means the way we are open to entities, which aren't outside, because there isn't any inner-outer.

173
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:24,359
It's just the way we're open to entities, period.

174
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:30,759
Okay, for Kant, the transcendent things are outside the mind, and there's an inner-outer story to be told.

175
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,560
For Heidegger and Merlot-Ponty, transcendence is openness.

176
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,079
Well, what else do we got in there?

177
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:41,239
Openness, that is the word.

178
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:52,199
No, because we have to know, but most we know, I think, because it's clear in Heidegger's Merlot-Ponty that there is no inner and therefore no outer.

179
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:59,999
Heidegger says explicitly, he's going to get rid of the inner-outer, subject-object, so that means internal-external thing.

180
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,640
So there's no mind for it to be outside of.

181
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,519
And you're an empty head.

182
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:08,159
If you're an empty head turned toward the world, it's not outside the mind.

183
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:17,839
I mean, well, yeah, it's not outside the mind is some kind of a special, separate domain.

184
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:24,480
If you mean it's part of your experience, which is then of course it is.

185
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,240
But it's not a good idea to call your experience inner or the world outer.

186
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,240
There's just an open field in which things are showing.

187
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,879
It's dangerous to call the open field, which we are, inner.

188
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,079
Because then you've got to have a problem out of relativism.

189
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,280
But that's good to say that, because I'm sure that there's plenty of problem people who agree.

190
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:47,760
Yeah.

191
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,839
Husserl transcendence.

192
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,360
Husserl transcendence.

193
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:52,959
Ah, the literal people.

194
00:16:53,439 --> 00:16:57,119
Well, Martin, what does Husserl mean by transcendence?

195
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,439
Music reveals.

196
00:16:59,599 --> 00:17:00,879
Yeah, I don't know.

197
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,159
If you give music on stage, then you don't get it in your head, but you give music on the stage.

198
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:17,920
So you've got that transcendence means, like in Kant, that the object is outside of the mind.

199
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:18,720
Is that right?

200
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,520
Outside of conscious, outside of consciousness, outside of transcendental consciousness?

201
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,240
It's not that you don't mean to use it up yourself.

202
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:33,359
So it's both in your mind, if you want to say that, in your consequence, as I do experience to use inner.

203
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,679
It's not made in your head.

204
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,560
Okay.

205
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:38,880
It's something you are directed at.

206
00:17:38,879 --> 00:17:39,280
Hmm.

207
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,599
It might not be a very important thing.

208
00:17:40,879 --> 00:17:41,440
I guess.

209
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:49,800
Imminence is supposed to be, for Husserl, what is in the mind, in your mind, right?

210
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:56,839
Completely produced by you, and so to speak, under your control and known by you, does that okay?

211
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:59,879
And transcendence is what isn't like that.

212
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,560
Okay, consciousness.

213
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,479
And then you get this funny question about how does that differ from experience.

214
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:22,359
But I think when Husserl says conscious, when Heidegger thinks, and Husserl certainly talks this way sometimes, he sees this gulf between consciousness on the one hand as one mode of being and the world as a totally opposite, a different kind of being.

215
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:28,679
And the question of how to get them together is a big question of the inner-outer, imminent, transcendent.

216
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:37,640
Whereas when Heidegger says that, well, when Nero Panti says a field of experience, he's trying to get over that ontological gulf.

217
00:18:40,439 --> 00:19:00,520
There's no special character of this field of experience except, well, back to that again, openness, except and you don't, you can't ontologize it as separable way of being.

218
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,800
I'm just, that's the best I can say.

219
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:02,919
You want to say something about it?

220
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:10,040
I just wanted to say that for Murray Ponte, it's more of an idea.

221
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:15,800
Okay, go ahead.

222
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:23,560
But the house is experienced as having a backside, even though you don't see it.

223
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,800
Strictly speaking, you don't see it because it's hidden by the front of the house.

224
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:35,839
And the broad emotion of transcendence here is the presence of that thing which is beyond what is visible.

225
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,720
And so it's not, it's true.

226
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,479
I didn't get to just interact.

227
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:47,920
It really is how perception can go beyond where it didn't be a very cognitive notion.

228
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:50,479
And that's what I was saying.

229
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:58,159
And then the other thing is, I therefore puzzled by your use of the phrase the empty head or constant.

230
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,720
And where empty heads turned towards the world.

231
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:12,800
In terms of just that phrase I thought was used in an earlier chapter to describe the immature state of development of a child who precisely has no grip on the transcendent.

232
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,239
Or whom perspective, there's no other, there's no place for perspective.

233
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,919
There's just lists of what is there.

234
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:18,800
Complicated.

235
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:33,120
Because he says, yes, it's the child, and yes, the material person will see that there are perspectives, but we have to preserve the truth the child had, otherwise we're going to end up monads, friends.

236
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,800
And that's what I was trying to do.

237
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:42,320
So we are, in some sense, all of the empty heads turned towards the world, but the child thinks we're empty heads turned toward the same world.

238
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:54,239
You see the pencil box with pencils in it, and even though you don't know that the hands can replace human example, we are all open to the same world, the kid thinks, up to the age of three.

239
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:03,120
But when we give this up, we don't turn out to discover that we are not open to the world, but only to a perspective on the world.

240
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:08,239
We're open to the world, the same world, but from different perspectives.

241
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:14,439
Remember all this discussion of these, I point to, Paul and I point to a landscape, then this factor is in this chapter, isn't it?

242
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,240
Or is it?

243
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,119
Is it?

244
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,359
It's in some other chapter too, isn't it?

245
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:20,519
It's in the with others, I think, but it's here.

246
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:21,560
He mentions it again.

247
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:43,240
And so when Paul and I point to the landscape, we point to that same landscape, and we don't have to figure out how he's having an experience of the landscape, and I'm having an experience of a different perspective of the landscape, and how, and that they are the same landscape, and my finger is in his visual field and his in mine.

248
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,239
All that's gone.

249
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:50,760
So in that thing, you know, we're open heads, Paul and Merlot here.

250
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,240
Open heads turn toward the world.

251
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,919
So what do they call him?

252
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:57,479
Born?

253
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,119
What's the whole way?

254
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:00,280
Why would his nickname this?

255
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,519
Do people ever call Merlot Punty anything that Maurice Merlot calls Tebow?

256
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:05,320
Not obviously.

257
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,360
Yeah.

258
00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:13,320
Well, I'm wondering what open or empty head is.

259
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,759
What's the ante is doing?

260
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:26,919
Well, it's keeping you from thinking that there's something like your private experience of the object or your even private experience of that perspective on the object.

261
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:29,560
That's all shared.

262
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:37,879
Well, the object is shared and that there are perspectives on it is shared and you've got yours, but you haven't got it.

263
00:22:37,879 --> 00:22:39,239
It isn't anything.

264
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,959
It isn't a private experience in you.

265
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:48,919
It isn't, I think we can disagree with Searle here, but if it causes a lot of static, I won't pursue it.

266
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:55,640
For Searle, your perspective is a visual experience in the mind caused by the object.

267
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:57,759
It's trying to deny that.

268
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,239
Okay, Elizabeth.

269
00:22:57,399 --> 00:23:01,599
I think you should insist.

270
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:07,360
I've got to deal with the example of the features which transcendence.

271
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,119
Right.

272
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:12,560
And that's sort of important.

273
00:23:12,879 --> 00:23:17,439
You can't just grasp all the properties of an object you have to turn around although.

274
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:19,200
This is what transcendence means going to be featured.

275
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:24,800
I think to understand it, you're going to have to read the thing chapter and then to read the time chapter.

276
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:31,439
Well, that's sort of what Albert was saying, too, where transcendence has to do with the back of the house.

277
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:36,960
If so, that's a very interesting issue you raised, because that's certainly not the way Heidegger's using it.

278
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,999
And I assume that Heidegger.

279
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:41,999
I see.

280
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:44,800
It's important to distinguish it from Heidegger.

281
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,480
For Heidegger, transcendence is openness.

282
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,280
It's another word for openness, and that's it.

283
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:58,560
Now, openness has a temporal structure in Heidegger, but that's transcendence is about the openness, for sure.

284
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,999
That's the extas, the outside of itself.

285
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,599
We are outside of, it's called the outside of itself in and for itself at some point.

286
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:09,280
Valentine is.

287
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,320
But now, I'm not convinced yet.

288
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,079
I'm just trying to decide.

289
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:38,640
Doesn't parallel Ponte, when he takes over this extas notion, mean, doesn't he, is he really clear the transcendence, or maybe the maybe the point is that yes, we're outside ourselves, and the ultimate way we're outside of ourselves is that there's always more to our experience than we can get.

290
00:24:38,639 --> 00:24:40,399
That's the back side of the house.

291
00:24:40,720 --> 00:26:37,679
And the more, the most basic kind of more is the temporal more that we can always follow out and find more and more and are projected toward that in the future is that so the time so transcendence seems to put together being outside yourself and that's the ecstatic character and that does more to the object than you can you can ever experience but being outside of yourself is being in time it's it's the same in being in time no it's the same as being in time wait but i'm still i am very worried rick you want to say something before you do let me just say my word uh it sounds to me like there are just two different meanings of transcendence that the i'm transcendent that is human beings are trans have transcendence or are transcendent in this openness and that objects are transcendent is is the house transcendent because you can't see the back which are those words which of those you are you are another subject you want to thank my holding the physical system is not this thing he has a whole lot of case view that he wants to mention together so uh in the next paragraph he talks about full synthesis talking about the inside of things does he use transcendence uh well that that's why he doesn't use transcendence right there but i think you can continue well i want you to use that about presentable synthesis but when he says a lot of consciousness transcendence a couple lines of the concept you just read that would be a good line that would help us together well consciousness, let's see let me let's read this transcendence paragraph because it's certainly worth getting straight about it uh we're going top of page 438 and four lines down, there is no transcendent interpretation and no judgment.

292
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,199
And I'm not sure this is crucial yet.

293
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,959
It does not spring from the very configuration of the phenomenon.

294
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,679
Or that there is no sphere of imminence.

295
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,399
You think he's now sort of setting himself off against Swiss realists transcendent.

296
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:56,399
No realm in which my consciousness is fully at home, secure against all risks of error.

297
00:26:56,399 --> 00:27:00,960
That sounds like it's more in the open-head business.

298
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:07,600
The acts of the I are of such a nature that they outstrip themselves, leaving no interiority of consciousness.

299
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,200
Consciousness is transcendence, transcendence through and through.

300
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,879
Well, I must say, that doesn't sound like the back of the house.

301
00:27:14,879 --> 00:27:18,639
That sounds like my version of Heidegger and him.

302
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,959
Let's see, non-transcendence undergone.

303
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:24,399
We have already said that such transcendence would bring consciousness to a stop.

304
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,640
Active transcendence.

305
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,240
Am I misreading it?

306
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,080
Doesn't that put it over on us and our general openness?

307
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,479
I have a very very 389 of this?

308
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:36,879
Yes.

309
00:27:36,879 --> 00:27:38,240
389.

310
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,640
At the end of the guitar, okay.

311
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:43,599
You're thinking about the deep burning.

312
00:27:44,879 --> 00:27:47,520
Are you sure we're doing 389 in this?

313
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:48,559
Really?

314
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:50,879
389.

315
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:51,839
Same world.

316
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,959
This is the so far if they are experienced by yours.

317
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:56,240
I saw this like green.

318
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,280
I think they are going to incur the initial or prefectivity.

319
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:00,240
Does anybody see this?

320
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:00,720
Am I going to be able to do that?

321
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,800
Oh, oh, for the end of the paragraph.

322
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,919
I was looking at the bottom of the page.

323
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,120
Go on, I see it now.

324
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:12,320
Yet they transcend all restrictions because this chain is standalone and introduced.

325
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:19,399
I got the impression that the world discovered things outside me, just as absent endscapes lead on beyond the usual tree and by my past.

326
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:25,879
Okay, objects transcend my experience, I think, but I am transcendence.

327
00:28:25,879 --> 00:28:28,999
When he says transcendence, he says you're the world.

328
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,240
It means that you're you're in the world.

329
00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:31,959
That's right.

330
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:32,839
That's what it means.

331
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:38,119
But when he but when he's talking about objects, he can say they transcend all perspectives.

332
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:43,640
That's very different than saying I'm transcendent, meaning I'm a field of experience.

333
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,479
I think you know both, but I can't see how they're identical.

334
00:28:48,039 --> 00:29:08,359
I mean, the the the intentionality means different notions of intentionality that we had earlier in the course, because it seems like on the one hand, you can think of uh openness to the world as a way of a way of being directed to it, and in fact a way that's more primordial as Heidegger would put it than the way this sort of would have put it, where the transcendent is beyond or have to get to somehow.

335
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:15,719
And then you we've also talked about the intentionality of objects and that they always refer to more than what they present.

336
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:21,879
And I haven't been quite sure what the connection between those two are supposed to be, but there has to be something issue here.

337
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:25,079
Well, see, there's transcendence of objects in which there's more.

338
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,680
That's what Valva and and Olivia are talking about.

339
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:38,440
But there's and there's this transcendence which is not the opposite of imminence, but which is the way we are just playing open.

340
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,800
That's I don't want to mix that up with intentionality.

341
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:47,160
That won't help because intentionality well, motor intentionality is the way we're open.

342
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:47,960
What?

343
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:51,800
Yes, motoring, which is operative intentionality, is motor intentionality.

344
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,920
And motor intentionality is the same as transcendence.

345
00:29:54,919 --> 00:30:13,760
You but there's another kind, and that's what James is also thinking about, in which it would be Searle kind of intentionality, where there is some kind of where the conditions of satisfaction are separate from what satisfies them.

346
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:21,839
in a way that in motor intentionality, although we're going to hear a lot about this, what we perceive is not separate from our activity of perceiving it.

347
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,039
Okay, let's go on.

348
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,720
I think this has been very helpful.

349
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,919
I have one more question now.

350
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,760
Does Searle use the notion of transcendence?

351
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:30,800
Because he was on your list, but I don't remember him ever using one of those.

352
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:32,479
What?

353
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:34,399
Okay, not.

354
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:35,280
I didn't think so.

355
00:30:35,439 --> 00:30:36,080
Good.

356
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,440
Okay, let's go on.

357
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:38,399
So where are we?

358
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:39,679
438.

359
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,640
Woody.

360
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,160
I was still trying to read the day.

361
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,599
I finished that paragraph.

362
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,240
I'm not sure.

363
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,760
See if I get it to go.

364
00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:48,399
I got...

365
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:49,439
Okay, let's see.

366
00:30:49,439 --> 00:30:57,680
So the extas tried to achieve and fulfills itself in the thing, wouldn't be the sight of anything, and so forth.

367
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,359
And what I was not in possession.

368
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:10,160
Since it is not in possession of itself and escapes from itself into the thing seen, that's the kind of transcendence that I am.

369
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:20,639
What I discover and recognize through the Tokyo is not psychological imminence, the inherence of all phenomena in private states of consciousness, but blind contact of sensationalist itself.

370
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,959
It's not even transcendental imminence.

371
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:24,799
I wonder what that's going to turn out to be.

372
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,000
That's Hotel and Kant, I guess.

373
00:31:27,999 --> 00:31:35,680
The belonging of all phenomena to a constituting consciousness, which is the condition of the possibility of the experience of objects.

374
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:36,719
Put that in there.

375
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:47,879
The possession of clear thought by itself is the deep-seated momentum of transcendence, which is my very being, the simultaneous contact of my being with the world's being.

376
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,399
Okay, well, that's fine.

377
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:55,560
I mean, I think he's being Heideggerian through and through, and he will spell it out later in terms of temporality.

378
00:31:55,559 --> 00:32:02,599
And it certainly has to do with the backsides of objects, but it's mainly just that's me.

379
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:08,040
Look, I'm constantly just thrown into the open, openly thrown into the world.

380
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,240
Okay, and what's indubitable?

381
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,240
Well, that's the next thing.

382
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:21,720
It looks like maybe what's indubitable is the seeing of the things seen, or the seeming to see of the things seen.

383
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:27,720
That's the move to try to get to the cogito out of this.

384
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:35,400
And that's what he's talking about when he starts the chapter, as he should start it anyway, the bottom of 435.

385
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,680
There can be no doubt at all that I think.

386
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:46,839
I'm not sure that there is over there an ashtray or a pipe, but I'm sure that I think I see an ashtray or a pipe.

387
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:49,480
Now, that's the Cartesian cogito move.

388
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:57,799
You can't be sure of any of your perceptual experience of objects, but you can be sure of the perceptual experience.

389
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,399
It's very straightforward.

390
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:01,399
I mean, I don't think you're used to it probably.

391
00:33:01,399 --> 00:33:17,320
When I was a graduate student and everybody thought about epistemology and never about ontology, everybody was quite clear from Descartes that I don't know, I can't be sure that I see the table, but that I right now, seem to be sitting the table.

392
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,160
How could that be wrong?

393
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,200
That's what C.I.

394
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,480
Lewis thought, that's what I thought, and so forth.

395
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:25,719
And it still sounds pretty convincing.

396
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:29,040
And now he's going to try to talk you out of it.

397
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:35,359
Now, it is, by the way, another one of these places where the new translation has introduced a mistake that isn't in the old.

398
00:33:35,439 --> 00:33:36,640
It's mysterious.

399
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:43,040
The next sentence is, now, is it fact as easy?

400
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,479
And of course it is.

401
00:33:44,479 --> 00:33:46,479
Now, is it in fact as easy?

402
00:33:46,479 --> 00:33:48,560
But how could anybody introduce that?

403
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,879
Maybe they scanned the book and then they didn't fix all the glitches in the scanning?

404
00:33:52,879 --> 00:33:54,160
I just don't know.

405
00:33:54,160 --> 00:34:08,879
Anyway, now is it involved as easy as is generally thought to dissociate these two assertions and hold independently of any judgment concerning the things seen the evidence certainty of my thought about seeing?

406
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,440
On the contrary, it's impossible.

407
00:34:11,439 --> 00:34:16,879
That's a wonderful, interesting claim, which I will try to explain in the bed.

408
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:24,879
Perception is precisely that kind of act in which there can be no question of setting the act itself apart from the end to which it's directed.

409
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,719
The intuition is the following.

410
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,160
And I feel very at home in this because I keep saying as a graduate student, this is what people had on their minds.

411
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,800
In fact, I wrote a chapter of my thesis about this.

412
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:48,159
So the sense data got very sophisticated and decided sense data wasn't just quaria like red patch here now, which certainly has no implications.

413
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,959
And if you ever could see it, it would be indubitable.

414
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:56,320
And Mero Ponty admits that maybe sometimes you do see qualia if you get in a particular weird frame of mind.

415
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,079
And if you do, they are indubitable.

416
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,920
That doesn't matter.

417
00:34:59,919 --> 00:35:05,760
But you want to find what's the indubitable basis of your everyday perception of people and things.

418
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,559
And now that's not going to be just red patches.

419
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:09,760
That didn't work out.

420
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:21,159
So now my thesis advisor, Roderick Firth, who was justifiably totally forgotten, came up with this brilliant idea that what you see are ostensible objects.

421
00:35:21,479 --> 00:35:26,680
So that's just a way of saying what is indubitable is I seem to see a table.

422
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,159
Now you don't just say a gray patch.

423
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,639
You can put everything into it that you have.

424
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:39,480
You can put the perceptual constancies and the shape and the size and the distance and the categorization of what object it is and just put scenes in front of it.

425
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:41,640
It seems to me I see a table.

426
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:47,080
The table is the ostensible table is the object of my perception.

427
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,560
And I can't be wrong about that.

428
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:54,280
The way I can be wrong about whether I see a table.

429
00:35:54,280 --> 00:36:12,040
And Merrill-Bonte's answer, which I will try to show you the pages, but the intuition, the phenomena, is very interesting and clear, is he thinks that just as you can see the backside or you experience the object, the house is having a backside.

430
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:22,680
So when you experience an ostensible table, you experience the table as existing, as really being there.

431
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:37,960
So that, as I put in my thesis, the ostensible table is not ostensibly ostensible, which means that you could be fooled, which means that you just lost the point you wanted to make, namely that there was something indubitable about which you couldn't be fooled.

432
00:36:37,959 --> 00:36:41,320
And that's what Merrill-Fonty is saying in this part of the chapter.

433
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:49,560
He's saying that you can't pry off an experience of the object which hasn't already committed you to the existence of the object.

434
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:55,160
So you can't have an experience of a neutral something called an ostensible table.

435
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,520
You can only have an experience of a table.

436
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:13,520
And of course, as soon as you're able to do, you get the peculiar fact that you can, though you can be certain that you're seeing a table, it isn't indubitable, or what's the word, incorrigible.

437
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:20,320
And so the attempt to find the indubitable, the sense data won't work, the ostensible object won't work.

438
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:28,320
There is a sense in which you are directly presented with and certain that it's a table you're seeing there.

439
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,320
And that sounds right.

440
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,479
But then comes the interesting puzzle.

441
00:37:32,479 --> 00:37:37,040
But if you're certain of it, then how come it could turn out not to be?

442
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:39,359
And you've got to have a place in there, too.

443
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,839
You were certain of it, but it's not indubitable.

444
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,439
What was the thorough phrase?

445
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,959
It's certain, but not incorrigible.

446
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:49,439
That is indubitable and incorrigible.

447
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:50,800
You see why they are the same.

448
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,800
It's certain, but you can doubt it.

449
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,520
It's certain, but you may have to take it back.

450
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:59,359
That would be couraging it.

451
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,280
It's not indubitable.

452
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,879
It's not incorrigible.

453
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:06,320
That is, you're certain about it, but it's doubtable.

454
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,560
You're certain about it, but it's correctable.

455
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:10,240
What is that experience?

456
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,520
Well, that experience is the one who goes into with a stone on the path.

457
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:25,920
Remember, you go along and you think there's a stone on the path, and you're ready to put your foot on the solid stone, and as you approach it, it looks bigger and bigger, and keeps its color constancy, just like stones ought to do.

458
00:38:25,919 --> 00:38:32,560
And then your foot goes right through it, because it's not a stone on the path, it's a light patch on the path.

459
00:38:32,879 --> 00:38:36,479
There is a sense in which you were certain that it was a stone.

460
00:38:36,479 --> 00:38:40,160
It looked like a real stone right there on the path.

461
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,800
And it was given to you as that.

462
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,240
It was ostensibly real.

463
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,280
It wasn't just a seeming stone on the path.

464
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,240
And it turned out there wasn't any stone.

465
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:00,440
Which means that you can, even though you're certain, you can take it back.

466
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:04,119
But it means that you can't just think you take it back.

467
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:04,839
One more thing.

468
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:15,240
The important Merrow-Ponte idea, I don't know if it's in Austin, but the important Mero-Ponte idea is that you, so to speak, don't get this certainty for nothing.

469
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:21,320
If you have to take it back, then you have to retroactively cross out the previous experience.

470
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,439
You've heard me say that.

471
00:39:22,439 --> 00:39:25,240
In Husserl language, the Nelima explodes.

472
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:31,320
I mean, it isn't just it calmly transforms from a stone into a sun patch.

473
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:35,320
You can't even remember anymore what it was like for it to be a stone.

474
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:46,760
Your experience is suddenly, startlingly, radically revived, and it's revised in such a way that it looks now as if you could never have mistaken it for a stone.

475
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,640
It looks like it's clearly a sun patch.

476
00:39:49,959 --> 00:39:51,879
Something's supposed to follow from that.

477
00:39:51,879 --> 00:40:00,039
Namely, that whenever something turns out to be uncertain, which you thought was certain, that is, you have to take it back.

478
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:01,719
You have other three things probably.

479
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:07,560
You have to take it back and you have to switch from I saw a stone on the patch to I seem to see a stone.

480
00:40:07,879 --> 00:40:16,279
And it's always in terms of something else which you're now certain about, namely that there's a sunlight spot on them.

481
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:22,839
And of course, that too, though you're certain, you might have to take back in terms of something else.

482
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:29,320
But it's always something, there's always something that you're certain of in terms of which you have to take back the others.

483
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:38,640
That's the sense in which, remember the phrase, forget where it is, there's nothing in the world that I can't be wrong about, but I can't be wrong about the world.

484
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:49,520
That's supposed to mean there's nothing in the world I can't turn out to be wrong about, but it's always in terms of something else that I'm right about that I could ever discover that I was wrong about the stone or the pack.

485
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:50,720
Hand over here.

486
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,199
Yeah.

487
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,800
Well, Carlo Huntington's saying that the well, it's real.

488
00:40:56,879 --> 00:40:58,560
No, I don't know if that's right.

489
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:08,320
If there had been a stone on the path and my foot had gone off, I could remember how it looked as I approached it and how it felt when I stepped on it.

490
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:12,960
But if there isn't, then everything gets restructured.

491
00:41:12,959 --> 00:41:16,799
And I can't even remember how it was.

492
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:24,239
At least I think that's how you're supposed to think about this exploding cross retroactively crossed out, something or other.

493
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,879
It gets crossed out right into your past.

494
00:41:28,879 --> 00:41:33,120
And again, remember the Telegraph Avenue example, which is more dramatic.

495
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:37,440
You can't remember the back of the girl once you've seen that it's a guy.

496
00:41:37,439 --> 00:41:42,960
You can't remember the nice thick house with an interior once you see that it's a facade.

497
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:45,120
It gets disburdened.

498
00:41:45,439 --> 00:41:49,199
Taken out of your experience because it turns out to be wrong.

499
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,800
So you can remember that.

500
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,839
You just can't remember.

501
00:41:51,999 --> 00:41:53,839
You can't remember the experience.

502
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,719
You can't remember what it was like.

503
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:09,359
You can't see anymore, even in memory, this real ro solid rock that you saw as you walked down the path, because you see already in memory that it's a sun that it's a sun patch.

504
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,000
It's been retroactively fixed up in memory.

505
00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:16,680
The the simplest example is the animals in tree puzzles.

506
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,280
You see lots of trees and you don't see the rabbits and the cats.

507
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,199
Then you do see the rabbits and the cats.

508
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,000
It's Rigeschaufted retroactively.

509
00:42:24,999 --> 00:42:28,839
You cannot imagine what it looked like when you couldn't see the rabbits in the catch.

510
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:33,560
You can't remember it now without the rabbits jumping out from the trees.

511
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:41,240
And that's the sense in which you're both certain of it and committed to it, and yet you take it back.

512
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,119
But you can't just easily take it back, I would say.

513
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,320
You can't just say, well, I seem to see a stone now.

514
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,320
It seems that it's a sun patch.

515
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:54,680
You have to say, I did see a stone, and I was certain of it, but I was wrong.

516
00:42:54,999 --> 00:42:58,759
And now I'm seeing a sun patch.

517
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,440
That's the phenomenon.

518
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,280
Let's see if I want to say anything more.

519
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,960
Let's sum that up.

520
00:43:03,959 --> 00:43:05,320
Well, I want to say one more thing.

521
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:22,119
And Austin-like, you can say that it just turns out the way the language works, that see is a success word, and to say, I see the table, is to commit yourself to there actually being a table there.

522
00:43:22,439 --> 00:43:24,920
And that's good phenomenology.

523
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:30,440
And moreover, it's a success word that you might have to take back.

524
00:43:30,439 --> 00:43:33,800
And then you say, I seem to see a table there.

525
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,440
And that's how the grammar of seeing works.

526
00:43:38,439 --> 00:43:41,240
And that's how the phenomena works.

527
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,760
And they fit together.

528
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,359
Album.

529
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:52,919
Some of you can answer thought by observing the inducable and the invertible don't do the same thing.

530
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,879
And inducable means can't be doubted.

531
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,839
Invertible means can't be corrected.

532
00:43:59,919 --> 00:44:12,480
And when you're seeing something, nobody's claiming it seems to be, you are, it is impossible in the psychological state of seeing to also do the psychological state of doubt.

533
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:20,800
But that's entirely independent of whether or not, as a matter of fact, one's right and one could be corrected.

534
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:29,999
So he says if I see an ashtray in the full sense of the word as tray, in the full sense of the word see, it must be an aspect there, okay?

535
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,240
And then he says, to see that is it actually to see that in existence?

536
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,760
So it's as if existence is sort of one.

537
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,519
Well, I forget that feeling quote.

538
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,479
But that's right.

539
00:44:40,479 --> 00:44:48,879
But the main point is a claim about psychology could be a claim about the psychological incompatibility of the doubting and the experience of it one at the same time.

540
00:44:48,879 --> 00:45:00,800
It's a claim about the phenomena such that it looks real and there would be no motivation for doubting it.

541
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,719
I mean, you could doubt it abstractly.

542
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,400
I mean, I can doubt right now that there's an electron there.

543
00:45:06,399 --> 00:45:12,559
But what he's trying to get at is that it gives my experience.

544
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:14,959
I mean, that's just crazy.

545
00:45:14,959 --> 00:45:20,960
I mean, I need it clear that there's an electron there and an electron there and I'm ready to deal with it and so forth.

546
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:23,519
So I don't know about this indubitable.

547
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:27,519
I think the important thing is not the psychological thing.

548
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:37,760
It's the phenomena is presented to you as really there and cannot be sensibly doubted.

549
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:40,800
That may be all we need.

550
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:57,560
And it's corrugible in the sense that certain event comes along, like the patch of sunlight turns out to be a patch of sunlight, it will automatically require.

551
00:45:57,559 --> 00:45:58,839
You don't have to think about it.

552
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,079
Your perception will just have to correct itself.

553
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:13,240
That's the retroactive crossing out and the fact that you will now see a color patch and you will understand that you only seem to see the rock.

554
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:19,079
There was one more thing I was thinking about just now that I wanted to make sure I got my mind.

555
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:24,439
You want to know if there's some important little well, it'll have to come back to me.

556
00:46:24,439 --> 00:46:24,999
Go ahead, Alex.

557
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,320
It's like the current like the coat.

558
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,519
You mean what is it?

559
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:31,160
How is it likely?

560
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:39,080
Well, in the sense that the I am, I exist, and what I think, I am, I exist.

561
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:43,959
Well, that's a mysterious version of this whenever I see it.

562
00:46:43,959 --> 00:47:00,600
And there's a way in which he's taxing something about, I don't know how best to factorize it, but it's like there's a kind of a performance of exclusion of possibility of hope because it's not.

563
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:07,959
Yes, there's a kind of exclusion of the possibility of doubt when you see it, except again in some very abstract way.

564
00:47:07,959 --> 00:47:10,680
Oh, now I remember what I want to talk about, the missing thing.

565
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:15,879
And I think I repress it because there's something I don't understand about it.

566
00:47:15,879 --> 00:47:20,279
And so I give it all to you, and maybe somebody will write a paper about it and fix it.

567
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:27,320
I mean, it's, I can't tell whether Marilla Ponty, which of the following two views Marilla-Ponty holds.

568
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:46,240
One, that when I get a maximum grip on it, when I see it in its richness, when my expectations are constantly being satisfied, when I could pick it up and hold it and smell it and so forth, could I still turn out to be wrong about it?

569
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,959
Now, I think I do understand it.

570
00:47:50,959 --> 00:47:56,399
I think he thinks the answer is yes, I could always turn out to be wrong about it.

571
00:47:56,399 --> 00:47:58,079
I think Austin thinks the same thing.

572
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:03,679
When you have a goldfinch in the garden, as I recall, you still read Sense and Sensibilia and so forth, anybody?

573
00:48:03,999 --> 00:48:12,239
And I hear it, and I see it, and I could feel it, smell it if I wanted to, and yet it might turn out not to be a goldfinch.

574
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,280
That's easy.

575
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,200
That's like the house might turn out only to be a facade.

576
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,920
But I think it could turn out that there just wasn't anything there.

577
00:48:21,919 --> 00:48:25,359
Now, is that a sensible thing to hold?

578
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:25,839
That?

579
00:48:26,399 --> 00:48:28,480
That might just be wrong.

580
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,839
But I do think Marilla-Ponty and Austin hold that.

581
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:39,759
And the reason I think so is this quote, I wish I could just open to it, where we can be unsure about anything in the world, doubt anything in the world.

582
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:44,479
The only thing we could be certain of is the world, meaning that there's always something we could be certain of.

583
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,920
If anybody finds it, say it, because I don't even remember which chapter do I read around in it.

584
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:52,640
But now, how could you understand that?

585
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:57,999
I mean, you can understand the sunspot turning in, looking like a stone and then not looking like a stone.

586
00:48:57,999 --> 00:49:04,800
You can understand the house looking like a house and then turning out to look like a facade, or the girl turning out to look like a man.

587
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:18,359
But what would it be to feel something and see it and use it and have it in front of you and it turn out not to exist at all, not just to be something else, like a facade or a house?

588
00:49:18,439 --> 00:49:19,799
I think, wait, let me finish.

589
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,639
I think I now understand the answer.

590
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:29,160
I think it's something hypothetical, not ever actual in anybody's experience as far as I know.

591
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:37,720
But it could, for instance, suppose, I remember these things from graduate school, suppose it now just faded out in front of all of us.

592
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,439
And there wasn't any morning electron.

593
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,320
Now, things don't normally behave that way.

594
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:53,720
But the point that I think both Austin and Marilla-Ponty want to emphasize is that seeing it now commits me to stuff about it in the future.

595
00:49:53,720 --> 00:50:05,000
If there's really an electron here in front of me, it's got to stay here in front of me through the whole lecture and be fast when I come back, be here when I come back next time unless somebody carries it away.

596
00:50:04,999 --> 00:50:13,959
And that is the, and all of those commitments are could turn out not to be fulfilled.

597
00:50:13,959 --> 00:50:16,600
Now, in our world, that hasn't happened.

598
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:23,159
And it could happen, I guess, if the quantum stuff had highly and probably all gotten the right synchronism, this could just vanish.

599
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,079
But anyway, but the important thing isn't whether in our world it can or not.

600
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:35,720
The important thing is that no matter how much of a grip you get on it, there's always so much more to it than you could ever get a grip on.

601
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,399
And all of that is contingent.

602
00:50:37,399 --> 00:50:39,640
That is, it could be otherwise.

603
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:51,479
So you can never get the kind of certainty that would be the kind of absolute certainty that the Kogito want, the Kogito people, the Descartes wants.

604
00:50:51,800 --> 00:51:07,200
And that's all right, as long as you remember that that's what certainty means for us is that everything is happening normally and you've got a grip on it and there's no normal expectation that anything could go wrong.

605
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:12,720
That only entitles you to say you're certain, you can see it.

606
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,440
That is, you actually see there is this thing there.

607
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:16,960
You are certain.

608
00:51:16,959 --> 00:51:18,640
Only you might be wrong.

609
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,919
That's just about how it is.

610
00:51:19,919 --> 00:51:21,760
Does anybody want to say something over here?

611
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,999
Well, okay, both of you and then I really have to go on.

612
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:30,639
First games and then my guy.

613
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,479
My magi.

614
00:51:32,879 --> 00:51:34,160
I don't get consonants in one.

615
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,359
There are a lot of consonants in there.

616
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:35,679
Yeah.

617
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:48,800
So I thought I understood what certainty was until the last one said I mean I thought certainty in conservative meant something like a level of endorsement, you know, not certainty if I think if I I wouldn't doubt it.

618
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,639
Well, but you're not wrong.

619
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:51,919
That's right.

620
00:51:51,919 --> 00:51:55,519
That's the epistemological linguistic way to put it.

621
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,320
That's not wrong.

622
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:05,200
But the phenomenological way to put it, which is the one that interests me or Ponte, is it actually looks like it couldn't ever fail you.

623
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:14,000
Even though you haven't got all the evidence in, your experience runs ahead and commits it to staying here and so forth.

624
00:52:13,999 --> 00:52:22,080
That's why when the stone turns into the sun spot, it has to retroactively cross something out.

625
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:25,040
It isn't just you have to change your beliefs.

626
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:27,280
You have to, the experience will change.

627
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:37,359
So there's not only a kind of endorsement and a commitment, there's an experience of it as really existing.

628
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:44,359
I mean, that's got to be important to the argument because that's the argument that nothing is indubitable.

629
00:52:43,999 --> 00:52:49,879
You can't find anything that's so minimal if you haven't already committed yourself to something.

630
00:52:50,200 --> 00:53:09,320
Or to put it more accurately, you could maybe with a qualia, but you can't find anything minimal in your everyday experiences of tables and chairs and stuff, which is the minimal thing that you don't endorse, don't commit yourself to, in your experience, jumps ahead and commits you to it.

631
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:16,040
So, what's the difference between when am I ever in a position to know that I?

632
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:17,959
Well, that's the right question.

633
00:53:17,959 --> 00:53:18,760
Never.

634
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:23,320
That is, it's always retroactively take backable.

635
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:32,280
But you can't help, this is again sort of Alva's point, psychological or phenomenological, you can't help taking it as settlement.

636
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,719
That's true, too.

637
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,240
It's a tricky business.

638
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:42,600
But remember, the whole point of this is, besides just putting all the phenomena on the table, is to tell, it is Merlot-Ponty's point.

639
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:49,800
So, the way perception works, there's no indubitable level of perception.

640
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,999
Now, I saw one other hand.

641
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:51,879
Was it Rich?

642
00:53:51,879 --> 00:53:52,760
You good, Annie?

643
00:53:52,999 --> 00:54:00,279
Yeah, well, I was wondering, in this whole discussion, I'm always remembering the sense in which the bodies look worthy.

644
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:00,679
Right.

645
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,200
And all of this perceives.

646
00:54:02,359 --> 00:54:02,679
Good.

647
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:08,839
And so, remember the passage where Merlot-Ponty has the sense that the body knows and the body understands?

648
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:14,680
Those things like there would have to be a level of, you know, body doubt or body's burden.

649
00:54:14,919 --> 00:54:15,639
I think that's right.

650
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:15,879
Good.

651
00:54:17,399 --> 00:54:17,799
Good.

652
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:22,119
That's a way of putting what I was just saying to James in a very Merlot-Ponty way.

653
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:38,160
Yes, the way that you're certain is that your body intentionality is taking account of it and making a prediction, so to speak, about it, getting set for what it's going to do next, and having been set for what it did before, your body intentionality is all committed that way.

654
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:48,159
And that's why it looks real, and that's why, if it turns out to be wrong, it gets taken back in a way not like your beliefs are taken back.

655
00:54:48,479 --> 00:54:49,359
That's easy.

656
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:51,040
You just take back this belief.

657
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:55,519
Now, it's got the different level of description, but I'm just repeating myself.

658
00:54:55,519 --> 00:55:07,200
But I think Rick has just added, all this phenomenological stuff I've been saying is about body intentionality, motor intentionality, and that's what perception is, is body intentionality.

659
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,960
Whether you're a field, you are, and you are an open field.

660
00:55:10,959 --> 00:55:12,720
You are a perceptual field.

661
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:14,800
But I don't know what that means to add that.

662
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,240
You almost mean it.

663
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,839
I also have a body intentionality.

664
00:55:19,919 --> 00:55:20,079
Oh.

665
00:55:20,959 --> 00:55:21,919
No, certainly not.

666
00:55:21,919 --> 00:55:22,960
Certainly not.

667
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:39,919
You are at the most basic level body with an open head turned toward the world and involved in coping with the world all the time and coping with things in a way that's already got the future in it committed.

668
00:55:40,479 --> 00:55:44,959
I would say that is a way in which I am starting or the I that you okay.

669
00:55:44,959 --> 00:55:48,079
So we've gotten rid of the togito as the I think.

670
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,600
So let's go back to this.

671
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:53,760
So what's indubitable then, have I talked about 435?

672
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,080
Yeah, that's just what we talked about.

673
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:05,599
Perception is the act, the bottom of 435, in which there could be no question of setting the act apart to the end, from the end to which it's directed.

674
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,800
I tha that my whole little speech was about that.

675
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,079
So we directly experience the existence of things.

676
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,760
That's another way to say the same thing.

677
00:56:13,999 --> 00:56:20,279
And that's uh what I just read in 436 at the top.

678
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,040
Let's read that.

679
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:29,800
Um perception and the perceived necessarily have the same existential modality.

680
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:36,520
That's the thing, you know, you try to get the ostensible object, but you can't because it it it looks like a real object.

681
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:49,560
Uh since perception is inseparable from the consciousness which it has or rather is, the weak in the thing itself, any contention that perception is indubitable whereas the thing perceived is not must be ruled out.

682
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:57,080
If I seem an ashtray in the full sense of the word see, there must be an ashtray there, and I cannot forego this assertion.

683
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,680
That's all exactly right.

684
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,920
Except that you might have to take it back.

685
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,919
That's what they're weird about.

686
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:05,159
But that's that's what we've been saying.

687
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,760
And then I'm reading my notes now.

688
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:16,199
The Cartesian Kobeko defender says that I can be certain of my visual experience while not being certain of the existence of the object.

689
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:22,760
The conditions of satisfaction of the visual experience may just not be satisfied, but there's still the visual experience.

690
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,400
That's what I think Thurley says.

691
00:57:25,399 --> 00:57:30,839
We might know on refle that on reflection, but that's not part of the content of the experience.

692
00:57:30,839 --> 00:57:31,960
I've said all that.

693
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:38,760
If I start to doubt the existence, it will look the object starts to look different.

694
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,160
And that's the middle of 436.

695
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:51,879
It is the essence of the essence of my vision to refer not only to an allegedly visible entity, but also to bring actual, to a being actually seen.

696
00:57:51,879 --> 00:57:59,680
Similarly, if I feel doubts about the presence of the thing, this doubt attaches to vision itself, and there is no red or blue there.

697
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:04,879
I say that I have not really seen these colors.

698
00:57:58,999 --> 00:58:06,160
I've only seen them.

699
00:58:06,479 --> 00:58:14,079
And I can see that at no time has there been created that clarity between my visual intentions and the visible, which constitute genuine seeing.

700
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,519
That's just the thing I said.

701
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:18,560
You have to take it back and say you seem to see it.

702
00:58:19,999 --> 00:58:21,679
And now I think that's it all this.

703
00:58:21,919 --> 00:58:27,280
Well, I guess maybe this is where the possibility of error comes in on 439.

704
00:58:28,879 --> 00:58:29,760
Let's try now.

705
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,759
I want to read the top of 439.

706
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,519
And yet it's not the case of perception.

707
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,760
It's not the case of perception, a special one.

708
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:41,039
It throws me over to the world that can do so only by outlearning both me and itself.

709
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:42,720
So that's the stuff I was talking about.

710
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,280
Thus, the perceptual synthesis has to be incomplete.

711
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:49,200
It cannot present me with reality otherwise than by running the risk of error.

712
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:53,520
That's the general claim, no matter how much of a grip you've got on it.

713
00:58:53,519 --> 00:59:02,480
In principle, at least, it goes beyond your grip in such a way that something could happen where you'd have to say you never had a gripple.

714
00:59:02,479 --> 00:59:13,440
It is absolutely necessarily the case that the thing that is to be a thing should have sides of itself hidden from me, which is why the distinction between appearance and reality has its place in the perceptual synthesis.

715
00:59:13,439 --> 00:59:16,240
That didn't add anything to what I wanted to say.

716
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:22,639
And now we, no, let's look at one other thing here.

717
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:27,359
And we got, I wanted to talk about the retroactive crossing off that I kept talking about.

718
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:31,399
So here we are on 3440?

719
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,039
3440?

720
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,679
Let's look at 340.

721
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,079
You know, maybe I really mean 340.

722
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:40,959
We're trying to find, I think that's the stone I've been trying to talk about all this time.

723
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:46,359
You know, it's just the middle of 344, but it's important to read it.

724
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:49,959
We know that there are errors only because we possess the truth and so forth.

725
00:59:50,039 --> 00:59:55,080
In the same way, the recognition of the truth is much more than some of the presupposes about.

726
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,679
No, why do I want to?

727
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:59,640
That's not interesting for us right now.

728
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,479
Let's try 298.

729
01:00:01,479 --> 01:00:02,599
I'm trying to find out.

730
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,480
I put it down to 298.

731
01:00:05,479 --> 01:00:06,440
Hmm.

732
01:00:06,439 --> 01:00:08,199
We've got 398.

733
01:00:08,519 --> 01:00:09,240
What?

734
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,280
498?

735
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:11,720
That's unlikely.

736
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:12,519
I give up.

737
01:00:12,519 --> 01:00:12,919
I don't.

738
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,120
Well, I don't know.

739
01:00:14,359 --> 01:00:17,160
Well, it's about retroactive crossing off.

740
01:00:17,399 --> 01:00:19,959
It may be the stone passage I'm trying to find.

741
01:00:19,959 --> 01:00:23,800
Because one placement talks about how it will be crossed out.

742
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:30,120
And I thought I referred to that with these numbers, but somehow I put down dyslexical numbers.

743
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,719
347.

744
01:00:31,959 --> 01:00:33,720
Or one more look.

745
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,599
The stone's on 346.

746
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,480
Ah.

747
01:00:37,479 --> 01:00:37,959
Okay.

748
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,639
So let's go there.

749
01:00:40,999 --> 01:00:42,439
345.

750
01:00:42,999 --> 01:00:43,639
Where?

751
01:00:43,959 --> 01:00:47,159
It certainly is 346.

752
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,839
I still don't see the fading.

753
01:00:51,479 --> 01:00:54,280
One, two, three, four, five.

754
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,039
At the end of the fifth line, and thy.

755
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:56,999
I must.

756
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,359
446.

757
01:00:58,359 --> 01:00:59,320
346.

758
01:00:59,320 --> 01:00:59,719
Ah.

759
01:01:00,439 --> 01:01:01,400
That will do it.

760
01:01:01,399 --> 01:01:01,959
Yes.

761
01:01:01,959 --> 01:01:02,679
There we go.

762
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:03,960
That's what I'm looking for.

763
01:01:03,959 --> 01:01:05,480
346.

764
01:01:05,479 --> 01:01:07,320
I don't know why I don't have anything like that.

765
01:01:07,399 --> 01:01:08,280
But the three.

766
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:11,879
Now, this is just to start what I've been saying and saying, look, we should look at it.

767
01:01:11,879 --> 01:01:17,160
The difference between the loose and perception is between the opponent's own path, a path of sunlight.

768
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:20,679
The flat stone will disappear in the confused structure.

769
01:01:20,679 --> 01:01:25,879
Now that means that my body has no grip on it, and yet I am capable of making this distinction.

770
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,200
I don't think that's got the retroactive crossing off.

771
01:01:28,759 --> 01:01:29,519
That's what it's called.

772
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:30,000
Yeah, good.

773
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,439
I knew it was at the top of the page.

774
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,999
There it is.

775
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:37,119
Enables us to cross out the previous illusion and regard it as null and void.

776
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:51,280
That it is the opening on the world started at the bottom of 346, which makes possible perceptual truth and the actual effecting of avar enabled, that means the taking for truth, thus enabling us to cross out the previous illusion.

777
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:59,280
Yeah, that's the thing I was I now notice, and this is what also what I wanted, 347.

778
01:01:59,439 --> 01:02:00,399
I did have that here.

779
01:02:00,399 --> 01:02:08,559
And if you go down to the middle of the page, there is an absolute certainty of the world in general, but not of any one thing in particular.

780
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:10,479
That's what I was looking for.

781
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:16,399
And now at the end of the space chapter, these things are all in funny places.

782
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:21,519
There is a world for me because I am not aware of myself, and I am not concealed from myself because I have a world.

783
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:28,160
This pre-conscious possession of the world remains to be analyzed in the pre-reflective Kogel, which we haven't got to.

784
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:31,519
That's what he also calls the passive Kogeco.

785
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:44,719
But let's go on, even though there's only five minutes left, to the next thing, which is really relatively easy, though he manages to make a heavy duty of it because it's a kind of, I think, French competition to say deep things about love.

786
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:50,799
And he has to compete with Sarah, who's been saying deep things about love in being in nothingness.

787
01:02:50,799 --> 01:03:06,559
So on 439, he goes right over in the middle of a paragraph, which is just outrageous, about fifteen lines down, from this whole perceptual story, which I just read, the to the whole next thing.

788
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:14,759
It would seem, on the other hand, that consciousness comes back into its rights and into full possession of itself if I consider my awareness of psychic facts.

789
01:03:14,759 --> 01:03:17,559
For example, love and will.

790
01:03:17,559 --> 01:03:20,040
And we're off on a whole night.

791
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:21,080
So it's well done.

792
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:29,240
I mean, the French have been writing novels and making movies about love for many centuries, and he's the heir to all that.

793
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,240
He's gotten in love with distinctions.

794
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:34,040
But I'm not going to sink into them.

795
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:36,439
You can read them and enjoy them on your own.

796
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:43,799
The basic point is that feeling love is dubitable.

797
01:03:43,799 --> 01:03:50,679
It isn't as if you have absolute certainty because when you feel you're in love, that's what it is to be in love.

798
01:03:50,679 --> 01:03:56,280
You can feel you're in love and be infatuated, and he has endless variations on that.

799
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:58,120
You can turn out to be wrong.

800
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:01,399
You can just say you can't trust your feelings.

801
01:04:01,399 --> 01:04:10,599
I think the most interesting way to say it, though he doesn't here, maybe he does somewhere in the book, that is your therapist can know you better than you.

802
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:15,959
You can say, I'm not depressed, and the therapist can say, oh, you're feeling depressed, you just don't know it.

803
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,719
Or you can say, boy, am I happy?

804
01:04:17,719 --> 01:04:58,559
and so forth and they can say no you're not or vice versa and so forth and people know other people's feelings better than they know their own feelings sometimes not all the time but as soon as it's any time then feelings no longer can be presented as something which you can't be wrong about if you start this whole story again about well I seem to be in love or I seem to be depressed then you'd have to tell another whole story like what I like about ostensible objects, how the seeming is uh always uh already really a feeling that you are in love and uh so forth.

805
01:04:58,519 --> 01:05:03,119
I I can't spell that out, but I'm that's the the way he would have to go.

806
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:05,280
So or let me seem out.

807
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:19,200
So seeming is not so feelings are not counterexamples and uh and and um from the middle of 439, from the moment I feel love, joy, or sadness, it's the taste that I love, that I am joyful, that I'm sad.

808
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:22,079
That's this commitment beyond the feeling.

809
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:27,439
Even when the object is not in fact, that is for others, myself, and so it have the value of it.

810
01:05:27,439 --> 01:05:33,359
And now attribute appearance is within me reality, and the being of consciousness consists in appearing.

811
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:43,200
All that is to say, when you feel that you're in love, you feel it as this is certain, this is real, this is it, and then it turns out that it wasn't or it can't.

812
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,719
That's the picture.

813
01:05:44,719 --> 01:05:58,639
Now, he does it also for willing in a way that I do not understand, but I want to ask at this point, I want to ask Bolivia, I think it's a weird product of the translation that he says middle of 439 for us.

814
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:03,839
What if willing, if it is not being conscious of an object as valid?

815
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,999
Does that make any sense?

816
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:09,839
I think that's what is 439.

817
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:16,879
My hunch is that what's being translated as valid is whatever French word would be, the word valuable.

818
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:31,519
Let me tell you, just based on the phenomena, I think what he's trying to say is where willing means something like, valid means something like valuable, and what is choosing if not being conscious of an object is valuable.

819
01:06:31,519 --> 01:06:32,399
That's what I think.

820
01:06:32,399 --> 01:06:33,999
And then he has this weird thing.

821
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:34,439
What?

822
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,839
What's the French word?

823
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:36,479
Valabla.

824
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:37,280
Valagla.

825
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:38,799
Okay, just what you were thinking.

826
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:49,240
So don't, those of you who have this now, the middle of 439, just a little below the middle, what is willing?

827
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:52,839
If not being conscious of an object is valid, that's not right.

828
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,200
It's valuable.

829
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,479
And I don't even know if willing.

830
01:06:55,479 --> 01:06:56,200
What is willing?

831
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,359
They're volunteer, I suppose.

832
01:06:58,679 --> 01:07:02,040
Yeah, well, because there's a food great station, don't do it yet.

833
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:05,959
Yeah, and it means something like choosing.

834
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:17,320
I mean, willing is for us, and it is willing is, I can will to raise my arm, but somehow that's not, it's got to be sort of tied up with desiring for him, it gets tied up with what's valuable.

835
01:07:17,559 --> 01:07:20,839
Will also tied up with desiring it is.

836
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:24,120
Okay, so change that to you desire.

837
01:07:24,439 --> 01:07:29,240
Well, I'm just going to change it for desire because we say that design as well as personal.

838
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:29,559
Yeah?

839
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,080
So don't change it.

840
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:33,799
Okay, just read willing, but it's a funny kind of willing.

841
01:07:35,639 --> 01:07:37,399
We've got to be wanting.

842
01:07:37,399 --> 01:07:38,519
You want to say something?

843
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:40,919
Wanting?

844
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:42,359
Is that all right?

845
01:07:42,359 --> 01:07:44,280
Okay, well, wanting would be fine.

846
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:47,160
It's just willing is just not the right word for it.

847
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:57,399
And then you want something valuable, or, and this is so funny, as valid precisely insofar as it is invalid in the case of perverse will.

848
01:07:57,399 --> 01:08:01,639
I think that means you want something because you know it's not good for you.

849
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:04,599
And people, you can do that.

850
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:07,799
But that's not an important qualification.

851
01:08:07,799 --> 01:08:09,799
It's just that that sentence is so murky.

852
01:08:09,799 --> 01:08:10,759
Now we've got to stop it.

853
01:08:10,759 --> 01:08:12,200
Let me just see where we are.

854
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:13,559
439.

855
01:08:13,559 --> 01:08:15,080
But let me read the bottom thing.

856
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:21,719
We're going to say love and wanting don't give us absolute certainty about eight lines from the bottom.

857
01:08:21,719 --> 01:08:27,399
Will or love would seem to be the same whether their object be artificial or real, considered independently of the object we see.

858
01:08:27,399 --> 01:08:33,519
But they appear to constitute the sphere of absolute certainty in which truth cannot elude us.

859
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:36,079
And that's the Kogel's claim.

860
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:40,240
And the answer is that's not so.

861
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:46,479
The the well, the claim is that we'll never be eluded from and so forth and so forth.

862
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:54,240
And now he's going to claim for all these nice pages about all sorts of mistaken loves.

863
01:08:54,240 --> 01:09:02,320
And then we'll be ready next time for the somewhat murky talk about transparency and the tacit Kobeko.
