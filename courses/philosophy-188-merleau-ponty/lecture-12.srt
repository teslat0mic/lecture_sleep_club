1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,079
What's hard about it, and this is what I ended up saying last time, is that it starts out fine with lots of interesting phenomenology, which, and it's typical of Merila Fonti, that he likes the descriptions that Lothrow has, that Thurler and Coffin and Desaltas have, and he likes the descriptions of the weird pathological phenomena in Schneider, that Gelve and Goldstein give.

2
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:38,079
And I think he also likes, though this is sort of more vague, the criticism that they have of other people's ways of understanding the phenomena.

3
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:51,280
But then in the case of all three of these guys, he doesn't like their analysis of what's going on, what explains all the phenomena that they're describing.

4
00:00:51,280 --> 00:01:02,239
And of course, it always turns out to be that they are still too much trapped into some kind of empiricist or intellectualist issue, a way of looking at things.

5
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,640
In Husserl, it's too intellectualist.

6
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,199
In the Desaltist, it's too empiricist, in naturalists.

7
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,039
And in Gelf Goldstein, it's, I guess, both.

8
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,319
They're the worst of both worlds, but they're also the most interesting because they've got such an interesting phenomenon to study.

9
00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:33,399
And the only way to keep track of what's going on is to always ask yourself, what's he agreeing with as he's doing this?

10
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,879
And this is what's so hard in the El Goldstein stuff we're going to do today.

11
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,800
And what is he saying is wrong with it?

12
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,639
And at least for you to keep your, that is your kind of vegan.

13
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,319
of telling you this.

14
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:50,439
I mean, it's always the conclusion is going to be they don't have being in the world.

15
00:01:50,759 --> 00:02:06,199
They can't understand the phenomena they're talking about because there's a more fundamental phenomena that they don't know anything about that only Meryl Ponte and somebody whose name is hardly ever mentioned Isaac knows something about.

16
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,359
And you'll see it again today.

17
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:24,200
What struck me today, at one point I decided I really promised to tell you how much of this is not of Meril-Ponte, but is George the Elk Goldstein.

18
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:33,639
So I started looking through the book to see where Meryl-Ponte leaves off and starts describing the Goldstein case.

19
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,679
And that's on page 122.

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:46,199
And then I kept looking and looking and looking and looking, where does he finally stop expounding the Goldstein and explaining it from his perspective?

21
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:56,199
Well, on page 140, that's almost 20, 18 pages of what you're reading is not what he thinks.

22
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:09,879
However, it's a valuable step for what he thinks, because it one shows sort of phenomena that you've got to take account of, and two, shows how you can't take account of it unless you've got being in the world.

23
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:13,479
So that's going to keep him busy for 18 pages.

24
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:24,240
Okay, let's go back in the light of what I just said, and in general, trying to make sense of him, to any old place where he says being in the world.

25
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,199
Those are the magic words that mean now I'm going to tell it to you my way.

26
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:52,239
And so one of the places right near the beginning that we ended with last time, or was near the end anyway, is the bottom of 115, which is, remember, that there's the zone of not being in front of which figures stand out and so forth.

27
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,320
In the last analysis, that's really good for the last analysis here.

28
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:17,919
If my body can be a form, if there can be in front of it important figures against indifferent backgrounds, which is all that the De Schultz see, and it's great that they see it, this occurs in virtue of its being polarized by its past, by its existence toward them, of its collecting itself in the pursuit of its aims.

29
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,680
Now, remember, all that is always the involved story.

30
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:27,440
I mean, the thing that he says the De Schaltes don't have is the pursuit, always the pursuit of its aim.

31
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:42,799
The movement, when I keep saying the movement toward optimal grip, the fact that there is something that says that it isn't just the way the visual system works that you have to study, it's the way this whole organism works geared into the whole world.

32
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:46,159
That's the, so all those phrases are important.

33
00:04:46,320 --> 00:05:00,439
The polarization of its past into the world, existence towards them, that is, in a way, existence in the past, whatever they're doing, and it's collecting itself in the pursuit of its aims.

34
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:08,200
So the body schema, you don't remember all its schema, is finally a way of stating that my body is in the world.

35
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,159
And then again, of course, one's own body.

36
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:16,280
is a third term always properly understood in the figure ground structure.

37
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:24,119
It's behind, yes, there's a deeper ground behind the figure ground structure, he's telling you.

38
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:27,479
And it's called being in the world.

39
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,239
I wanted to stop for a second.

40
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,799
That was all review.

41
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,280
Well, maybe I should go on with the review and then stop for a second.

42
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:42,199
And this special kind of background is also what he calls bodily space.

43
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:51,159
And bodily space is got these three, I think I said this, but I can say it again, three unique characteristics.

44
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:52,600
I just said the first.

45
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:56,359
It's the background for ordinary figure ground experience.

46
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:05,239
It can never be made into a figure without transforming it into something else, because when it's doing its job, it's never present.

47
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:16,919
That is always the darkness in the theater in which you can see the spectacle, the non-being, in terms of which all beings can be experienced and so forth.

48
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:25,400
And that boy, to quote that other place, talked about it in 117.

49
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,039
These are such important quotes to keep us vegan, we can go into the looking next part.

50
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:51,760
It's the at the new paragraph on 117, it's bodily space and external space from a practical system, the first being of the background against which the object is a gold out and they stand out, or now the void in front of which it may come to light is clearly an action that the spatiality of our bodies is brought into being.

51
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,879
And an analysis of one's own movements should enable one to arrive at a better understanding of it.

52
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,080
And that's what it's going to turn to now.

53
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:13,119
It's and so the third characteristic of it is that it's this void isn't just any old void or any old non-being, but it's a non-being that's tied into your involvement.

54
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:15,520
That's what I was just saying.

55
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,720
And okay.

56
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,880
I wanted to say two now, sort of, just sort of getting something straight.

57
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,560
I wasn't very clear last time, and it didn't bother anything, I said.

58
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:34,000
The motility chapter here is about our movement.

59
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:41,600
And then there is a later chapter which is going to be about motion, about how we experience the motion of objects.

60
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,199
And that's another whole subject.

61
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,679
So they shouldn't be mixed up together.

62
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:48,480
Unfortunately, I haven't gone back and looked at the French.

63
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,439
I don't know.

64
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,720
There's Olivier here in the French.

65
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,119
Well, how can we go on without Olivier?

66
00:07:55,119 --> 00:08:00,720
And Josh is going to ask you, does the French have a distinction between movement and motion?

67
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,000
The German does, have it, the Veguum and the Vegeta.

68
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:06,960
But I don't know.

69
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,159
I can't think of any French that makes those distinctions.

70
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,120
That makes it harder to see what the two issues that are so separate.

71
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:24,840
But I guess the Engl our English translation has it in terms of, oh, we can look at the French and see what what's the name of this chapter, which gets called motility.

72
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,599
It should be in the favour of content.

73
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:34,119
But, oh, no, I mean, in the French, what are they translating as motility?

74
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,040
So we can find out.

75
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:37,800
So here we are.

76
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:41,720
Spatiality du Corp copre et le motité.

77
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:49,640
Okay, it looks like mot crisité is going to be his word, the French word for body movement.

78
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,760
We don't have it terribly clear in English.

79
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,000
People talk about the movement of the heavenly body.

80
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:57,800
So we've got to talk about the motion of the upper planet.

81
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:07,720
Anyway, so then later, there's going to be a lot of talk about the experience of the motion of other things.

82
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:10,119
I'm not even going to try to find out where that is.

83
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:16,920
I just want to make that these two different issues and keep clear which one we're at.

84
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,359
That's no problem.

85
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:21,240
I just wasn't focusing on it last time.

86
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:50,280
Now, another thing that is not a main problem, but in office hours, I was asked a third interesting question about why are we calling this body, which is the body FEMA, which is our general way of having a world, which we share with everybody else, which accounts for why we see the same colors and the same constancies and brightness and shapes and space and time as everybody else.

87
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:57,320
And which she talks about later, I don't think we've seen it yet, the way one experiences in me.

88
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:02,200
And that's just another way of saying that the body FEMA is what we call that.

89
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:09,080
It's in sort of more contemporary and more neurocharging, it's a perceptual system.

90
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:19,200
The perceptual system isn't yours or mine, and the body FEMA, which is the way the perceptual system actually gets lived, isn't yours or mine.

91
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,080
So why does he keep talking about my own body?

92
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,560
He ought to say one's own body.

93
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,239
or maybe nobody's own body.

94
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:31,360
I mean, it's just, it should be just the body.

95
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:33,599
And the answer is he shouldn't.

96
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,639
And he doesn't.

97
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,160
That's an artifact of the translation of it into English.

98
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,560
In French, it's La Carco.

99
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,640
And that means something like, well, the body as it really is.

100
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:46,559
And that's fine.

101
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,800
I mean, that's really the right way to think to say.

102
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,520
That's neutral.

103
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:58,560
That's supposed to distinguish the body as it really is from the body as an object to be studied by as an object in the universe.

104
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:10,640
It distinguishes it also, I think, the body from when I'm moving it, which is not what interests him, where I have an intentional action and that governs and causes a bodily movement.

105
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,480
That's not what Carl Crofra.

106
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:18,000
The chlorophoper is the body as it is sort of at its best or something like that.

107
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:24,960
It's the body in everyday, transparent, open, directed sort of goal, of course.

108
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,399
Okay, I just wanted to say that because it never occurred to me before that that translation is misleading.

109
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:41,520
You should always bear in mind that he's not talking about your experience of your body, but something that, for one thing, nobody needs to experience.

110
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:49,519
Because the body schema goes on doing all the things it's doing, whether you experience it or not, and most of the time you don't.

111
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:57,999
I mean, you don't have to experience how it keeps the brightness constant and the colors constant as the illumination shifts and so forth.

112
00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:04,520
The body schema can take care of that without any help from your conscious ego.

113
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,920
Is that clear?

114
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,040
I think that's important.

115
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:18,760
You've got to be clear that the level on which he's talking, which is impersonal, transparent, coping, period.

116
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,280
And the way we've come across it so far is we're calling it the body schema.

117
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:25,559
Any questions about that?

118
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:34,120
It's not news, but it's hard to get used to if the translation sort of pushes you in some other direction.

119
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:50,120
Where you think, for instance, trying to feel what it's like to have a body, get your kinesthetic sensation in front of you, or try to feel what it is like to have proprioception and so forth, that's what you shouldn't be doing.

120
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,399
Because when the body category, I keep saying this to me too, but I've kind of gotten used to it.

121
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:01,800
When the body schema is operating at its best, it's not being experienced by anybody.

122
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:06,920
And it's just doing what the general perceptual system does.

123
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:10,840
Okay, I don't, yeah, that maybe is meant to be provocative.

124
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,119
Okay, go ahead.

125
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:13,479
Well, just a simple question.

126
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:24,279
How does the how does phenomenology phenomenology which is carried out in the first person by reflection, not reflection, by consideration of one's own case?

127
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,440
Okay, good.

128
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,680
So this came out in office hours too in an interesting way.

129
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,880
I was asked the question.

130
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,399
Well, it's Agnes Herris, who is the one who did all that.

131
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,440
Asking of these good questions.

132
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:46,080
Anyway, the answer's got to be that Merrill-Ponty does his motion by talking about breakdown cases.

133
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,640
That's why there's all this pathology of in all around.

134
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,960
You can see it by seeing what it would be like not to halt it.

135
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,239
And that's what he's going to do.

136
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:57,919
All the stuff of Schneider is an illustration that points.

137
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:04,240
It all points towards something that Schneider has but he's not aware of and we're not aware of, namely being in the world.

138
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:07,680
But since we don't have it, look what a mess you're in.

139
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,960
That's the first thing to say.

140
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:17,999
But the second thing to say is, and notice he's doing these breakdown business even in the simple case of the ship and the mass and the trees, if you saw.

141
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:28,239
When you want to slow down the microsecond that it takes you to take in a new scene, which you don't just automatically take in, you've got to organize it.

142
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:32,240
And the Gestalts know that, and Walter Freeman can measure how long it takes.

143
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:45,359
And Merrill-Ponty can't tell you go look at it because you're in a familiar world in which you are so and you come from a place where it's already organized into a place where it's going on just as you expect it.

144
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:49,359
But they'll give you a breakdown case to slow it down.

145
00:14:49,359 --> 00:15:00,080
Or the other breakdown case we talked about in a museum facing a new kind of painting, presumably, you have to let your body push you around for a while till you get to the right distance to see it.

146
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:06,479
You can't count on your normal distance to see the thing on the wall as a normal object, and so it slows down.

147
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:20,400
So now there's a big problem behind that, which you probably would ask next if I let you, which is, how do you know that these breakdown cases point to something else that you're not experiencing, which is really the basis of them?

148
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:29,399
Well, one way, and that's why I mentioned the trees and the masks, is some of these breakdown cases, it's a matter of degree, which is nice.

149
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:41,560
I mean, you can sort of find intermediate cases to talk like Wittgenstein from the mass boat case to the case in the museum, to the case where you just turn and there everything is where you expect it to be.

150
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:52,919
If you lay out all these intermediate cases, you can then feel convinced that the breakdown case is not revealing something else that goes on when there's something wrong.

151
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,840
That's how the mask one works.

152
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,920
It's different with, you know, Goldstein.

153
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:02,840
His breakdown case is definitely revealing something that isn't there normally at all.

154
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,560
These are two different kinds of breakdowns.

155
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:12,280
And that case, you can't say, you know, you want to gradually find that somebody is battery damaged.

156
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:14,840
But you can do two things, I think.

157
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:20,040
One, you can just use it to point to something that's missing, which is how he's using it.

158
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:22,760
You can also do it better and better.

159
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:27,400
Schneider is such a mess because he's got too many things wrong with him.

160
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,640
Then you get somebody like B.F.

161
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:44,039
that Milmer and Good write about, and if you've got a paper on the list on the virtual reader by Sean Kelly about, where you get just separated out a piece of the pathology.

162
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:48,119
And you can do now, more and more, you get them separated out.

163
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,040
And then you can see each one.

164
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:55,639
I'm going to get back to another wonderful one, utilization behavior as an example of this.

165
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:10,200
You can use pathology to show sort of isolatable capacities by showing isolable lack of them and instead of sort of quote.

166
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,440
But anyway, that's not, I don't think there's any simple answer.

167
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:17,359
Except this, phenomenology is not introspection, the more resort.

168
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:31,999
Phenomenology is not consulting your ordinary everyday experience because in your ordinary everyday experience at its best your your body scheme is doing fine and you've got no access to it.

169
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:44,159
That's what it's just so so mistaken to think that phenomenology has anything to do with introspection, reflection, meditation, and all that.

170
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:51,200
Monero Fonte is not trying to tell you what stance to get in to see what he's talking about.

171
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,239
He's got to do it in this much more roundabout way.

172
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,639
It's always about breakdown.

173
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,520
Yeah.

174
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:59,519
Do you worry about that?

175
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:12,080
For example, if my little selfish deals need to see how many people die by the students, then wouldn't it say of wait, I mean, it's my trouble.

176
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,759
I don't hear very well anymore.

177
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,720
You have to talk louder.

178
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,759
I didn't quite get it.

179
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:16,079
Say it.

180
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:17,759
Just say it again loud.

181
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:31,519
If I'm not comfortable looking at people's eyes, but I'm just trying to get these ways of feeling the world, my own being in the world.

182
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:33,759
Well, I guess I've got several things to say.

183
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:36,639
One, if it was, it wouldn't be interesting to Merloponte.

184
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,239
It would be too, I don't know what Anti-Kaideger would say.

185
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,279
It would be too specific, and he's interested in the general structures we share with everybody.

186
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:52,399
But I think the more interesting thing to say is with you is that you wouldn't normally be aware of that.

187
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:55,359
And it's transparent.

188
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:02,680
And now, and if you become aware of it, I bet he would say, it's as if you were viewing yourself as an outsider would view you.

189
00:18:58,479 --> 00:19:03,799
Yet you can do that.

190
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:10,839
But insofar as you're just engaged in doing it, I think he would say it is invisible to you that you're doing it.

191
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:15,479
Once you've got your attention sort of called to it, you can catch yourself doing it.

192
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:29,319
So I don't see that that's got surely all the phenomenology isn't like that, catching you doing some specifically individual kind of thing and then making you notice it, I don't think.

193
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:30,200
I mean, why should it?

194
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:32,440
It's got to be general.

195
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,880
It's not about you or me.

196
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,639
It's about the La Co-Paw.

197
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,400
It's about the body schema.

198
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,119
It's about the perceptual system.

199
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:51,160
And if it's true that the perceptual system operates at its best when it's operating invisibly, then calling your attention to it has got to be very tricky.

200
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,200
You've got to, you can't just reflect on it.

201
00:19:54,519 --> 00:20:02,279
Well, what I was talking about is that I would make authorization of my own model that we're talking about.

202
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:10,599
I think even though I'm not explicit about it, I would never be able to get out of it.

203
00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:16,519
We're only experiencing so high-level modes of model and attitude.

204
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:21,240
But what you're not experiencing, I'm not sure we're having any disagreement.

205
00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:25,319
That's fine, but what you're not experiencing is anything uniquely yours.

206
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:38,999
You're experiencing what anybody, but matter of fact, he's interested in this only at a level in which if everybody were not looking at people's eyes, they're looking at their shoes, and if that was some kind of structure of human beings, then he'd be interested.

207
00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:40,599
But otherwise, that's nice.

208
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:46,799
And somebody could write a kind of, like Sartre writes about in Landauze.

209
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,120
You could write about, well, that's an interesting example.

210
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:59,440
Le Nause is a kind of, in Sartre's book, nausea is a kind of phenomenology of a particular person with a particular psychosis.

211
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,720
It's interesting because it happens to be in psychosis, he thinks, which reveals the world as it really is.

212
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,280
But it's too specific.

213
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,880
For Heidegger, it's existing CL and not exist in CR.

214
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,680
For Husserl, it hasn't made the eigenic reduction.

215
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,920
It's phenomenology of biography.

216
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,639
And there was a whole school I can't help telling you.

217
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:33,200
I think the guy who rented it is dead now, I'm pretty sure, which is just, I don't mean just as well in the sense that he wasn't a nice guy, but I guess he was doing a lot of harm.

218
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,039
Because he had this summer school in phenomenology, and what it meant was you go to St.

219
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:45,600
Louis, where he was, and you spend your time going around trying to describe exactly how this kind of bridge looks to you on a rainy day or something.

220
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:51,519
That's exactly, that's not introspection exactly, but it's certainly not phenomenology.

221
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:57,680
It's because phenomenologists aren't interested in how that bridge looks to you on a rainy day.

222
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:03,840
They are interested in how bridges manage to look, either if they have the same size and the same form as you walk around.

223
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:06,239
Anybody walks around any bridge.

224
00:22:06,239 --> 00:22:09,759
And it's, I'm amazed that I'm spending so much time talking about this.

225
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:13,359
I would have thought this was absolutely obvious, but it is it isn't.

226
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,720
I will go on, yeah.

227
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:16,639
Mr.

228
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:23,760
Edgeland, there was a reading of the particle page in the past that there was auto recognition for the Bodish schema.

229
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:33,079
The Different, who says the Bodhischema is the same for everybody else, and you associate it with the perceptual system.

230
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,799
Where is this dynamic part of the whole?

231
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:41,879
Ah, good.

232
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,879
Let's see, two pieces to that.

233
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:51,159
One, of course, everybody's directed to their own goal, and everybody sees the world from their own perspective.

234
00:22:51,160 --> 00:23:08,519
So he's just abstracting from that and saying it doesn't matter which goal, but it's always a chance to, you know, question of whether you're trying to get a maximal grip on the maps and the trees or the picture in the museum or just the people, or me if you're looking up here.

235
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:09,479
That's one thing.

236
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:12,920
So be sure it's always goal-directed, it's always trying to get a grip.

237
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,599
That's one story.

238
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,200
And the other one, what was the second point?

239
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:16,839
Oh, yeah.

240
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:22,279
And the percept, if you, depends on how you view the perceptual system, of course, and I should say something about that.

241
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:34,759
From the Gestaltist point of view, there is already this anonymous perceptual system doing the stabilizing and organizing of experience.

242
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:40,359
And in that way, the Gestaltists have got gone to something very important.

243
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,639
And half-right, it's anonymous and it's organized with the perceptual world.

244
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:56,759
And half-wrong because they haven't taken into account that the perceptual system itself only works when it's integrated into a world in which it's already pursuing significance.

245
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:59,079
It's the Walter Freeman objection.

246
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,520
It's what Walter Freeman says against all neuroscience.

247
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:10,599
They just sort of think they can study what goes on in the brain without asking what the organism is doing in the world, and you can't.

248
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,479
And the Gestaltists are making the same mistake.

249
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:24,720
They think, oh boy, if we can only find the fields in the brain that underlie the perceptual balances and equilibrium in the perceptual field, we'll understand something.

250
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,920
And Nero Pati is not saying you never found it, ha ha, which is what everybody else said.

251
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:34,880
He was saying even if you had found it, it wouldn't mean anything if it weren't correlated with gold.

252
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,520
Okay, I'm glad you, I think you knew that already, but you wanted me to say it.

253
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:41,680
Some of the areas, I think I said it.

254
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,960
Okay, let's go back.

255
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,599
I mean, that's all good review.

256
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:57,039
But now we're going to go to the breakdown case on 117, the blast being in the woodland, and see what that looks like.

257
00:24:57,999 --> 00:25:16,559
And we're going to see it by way of seeing sort of the best Gestalt neuroscientist dealing with the interesting case of the guy called our patient at the top of 118, who was later called Schneider.

258
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,960
Just occurred to me for absolutely for what it's worth.

259
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:25,519
Schneider can't be his real name, but it's funny that they named him Schneider because that in turn means cutter, and he cut the wallet.

260
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,600
I suppose that's no accident.

261
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,279
And by the way, Schneider was a good friend of Gervich's.

262
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,399
Remember, I mentioned Gervich.

263
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,599
Gervich used to walk Schneider home after Bell the Gold Sun had been studying for a while.

264
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:43,599
So because I shook hands with Gervich and he used to buddy of Schneider's, you were studies of Schneider's second hand.

265
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,119
If I don't feel any more interested in his weird case, I never asked Gerbik about him at all.

266
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,720
I feel now I wish I had, and that's what it would have been more.

267
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,239
But three ecletic about his world.

268
00:25:56,239 --> 00:26:05,960
Okay, let's go now to the whole story of Schneider.

269
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,960
Let's see where I am.

270
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:28,440
So the important thing to bear in mind through it all, and I guess this is where I was at the end last time, is that the way Del Goldstein are going to analyze Schneider is in terms of their basic categories, which are the abstract attitude and the concrete.

271
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:49,079
And we'll see in more detail in a minute what that means, but roughly, that means there's this involved coping attitude and there's a detached attitude in which you can step back from your involvement in your coping and describe everything, recruiting your own body.

272
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:57,639
And that they think that roughly, I think they think, I was trying to figure that out for sure.

273
00:26:58,999 --> 00:27:01,319
As you read it, see if this is true.

274
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:08,680
They think that Schneider's got the concrete attitude, but he lacks the abstract attitude.

275
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:18,920
And Merrill-Ponty thinks Schneider hasn't got either one because one, he lacks something that without which you couldn't have any, either of them.

276
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,599
And secondly, he hasn't got either one because there are no such things.

277
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:27,479
They're abstractions, the concrete and abstract attitude from being in the world.

278
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:41,759
And there's, I can't resist saying this now because I might forget later, but what the concrete attitude would look like if there really were such a thing is something that Eric has shown me neuroscience of that Merrow science.

279
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:42,359
He didn't know.

280
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,720
I think he would have found it fascinating.

281
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:57,999
What would it be to be in a concrete attitude in which you are, and I will get to it, that the concrete attitude is your, well maybe you should read it, yeah, you're on page 122.

282
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:17,599
And it sounds just, it is Schneider, and it is, I think, what they think we all, so he's sending these wallets and sewing them together, and then about 10 lines down, the body is no more than an element and a system of the subject and his world.

283
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:23,680
The tasks to be performed are listed the necessary movements from him by a sort of remote attraction.

284
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,639
Well, that's sounding sort of close to right.

285
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:33,279
I mean, I say things like that all the time when I'm trying to explain how we respond to affordances.

286
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,519
And I think I may have already said the house in Homer.

287
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:37,920
Did I mention Homer already, my favorite example?

288
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,319
I did.

289
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:41,440
Okay, yeah, that's like their arms going out to the food in front of them.

290
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,200
Schneider is just like the hungry Homeric heroes.

291
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:58,319
So there's a remote attraction that has the phenomenal forces that work in the visual field, elicit for me without any calculation on my part, the motor reactors that establish the most effective balance between them and so forth.

292
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:06,319
That's a good disclosure account for Schneider and the affordances.

293
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:20,639
But if you had that and no abstract attitude, just pure Schneider response to affordances, pure concrete attitude, how would it look?

294
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:27,920
Well, I had no idea until Eric showed me this pathology, something called utilization behavior.

295
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:42,279
People who have a certain brain damage are so sensitive, so pulled in by affordances that they take up whatever is around that is sort of saliently afford doing.

296
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:47,559
So if you put an apple on your desk while you're interviewing them, if you're the doctor, they eat the apple.

297
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:50,520
If you put glasses on the desk, they put on the glasses.

298
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:56,039
Sometimes they have as many as four pairs of glasses on by the end of a session with the doctor.

299
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:56,999
I mean, there are the examples.

300
00:29:56,999 --> 00:30:03,239
I wonder if a streetcar goes by, and they take it, whichever, never mind really where it's going.

301
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:05,639
You afford jumping on.

302
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:13,960
And my favorite example is, it's sort of sexist, but it isn't, I didn't make it up, it's just the way the world goes.

303
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:26,760
They had a man who was a patient like this, and they took him into the room where there was an unmade open bed, and he got undressed and went to bed, because that's what beds afford.

304
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:35,639
And they took us, separately, they had a woman patient, took her into this room, and she immediately started making the bed.

305
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:41,799
So you can see that different people see different affordances depending on the culture that conditions them.

306
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:45,639
Anyway, that's pure responding to affordances.

307
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:50,039
And that's clearly not what we do.

308
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:59,720
And Schneider's clearly got something wrong with him, even when he's described like a homeric hero, just in there doing the wallet.

309
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:06,440
And we will, and so on the other extreme, I haven't found an example.

310
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:20,479
There would be, I'm sure, some kind of pathology of pure abstract attitude in which somebody would have a completely detached view of themselves and everybody else sort of from nowhere.

311
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:28,159
I mean they can't quite achieve God's point of view, but they would be constantly in a kind of detached theoretical relationship.

312
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:35,120
Maybe there can't be any such person because at least they'd have to be hospitalized because they, without they, they wouldn't be doing anything.

313
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,720
Nothing would have practiced to do.

314
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,279
Well, no, they would be, but they did anything.

315
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:47,120
They do it because they figured out that this was the time, for instance, that you didn't achieve by putting the food on the fork and putting the fork in your mouth.

316
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,879
Maybe there are such pathologies.

317
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,960
If anybody knows, let me know.

318
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,360
Yeah.

319
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,639
Well, they will have damaged the emotional purpose of the brain.

320
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,479
They're unable to ask on the effective colours of the world.

321
00:32:00,479 --> 00:32:10,319
They really have to decide consciously to do anything and therefore often, because they can't say goals, can just be a force that they don't do anything.

322
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:12,560
Okay, an internal amount of time.

323
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,359
Very difficult to do it.

324
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,079
So that's good.

325
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:16,479
That's good.

326
00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:20,479
Well, they would be going out to the pure abstract attitude.

327
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:25,839
And I'm setting this up so that later you can see why Merylo-Ponte is going to want to refute this.

328
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:27,999
He's going to want to say in effect.

329
00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:35,039
These two attitudes are very weird, extreme things, attitudes.

330
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,039
They're not our normal attitudes.

331
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:55,599
And moreover, you can't get on, how would you get your normal attitude just by sort of bumping these two extremes together, which is what all of Gail Goltran can do since they don't have an underlying thing called being in the world, of which these could be sort of degrees of going toward abstract or going toward involvement.

332
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,479
And that's the basic idea from his point of view.

333
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:16,119
You can't get sort of pure receptivity where you're just responding, like the utilization behavior, to whatever goes along, together with pure spontaneity, whereas a free agent, you're choosing what to do.

334
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:40,279
And you can't get those two things together in any understandable way to explain the thing we've got, namely not just responding to each affordance, which holds us in completely, and not standing outside and having to make up our minds about whether anything is worth pursuing at all.

335
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:45,400
You can't get those, if those are the only two possibilities you've got.

336
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:51,560
Pure receptivity and pure spontaneity, you're never going to get what we've done.

337
00:33:51,560 --> 00:34:03,479
And that's the direction he's gone during those 18 pages where he's telling you a lot of interesting, crazy things that Schneider can do and can't do.

338
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,159
Albert, do you want to take this thing?

339
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,600
Yes, I wanted to just call attention to two things.

340
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,640
One is that he doesn't ever talk about concrete or abstract attitudes.

341
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,279
He seems to always talk about concrete or abstract movement.

342
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,319
And I don't know whether that's significant, but I'm supposed to come in.

343
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:23,560
I have to say, I haven't seen my eyes.

344
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:29,880
The second thing I wanted to say is that there seems to be three different kinds of behavior contrasted in this chapter.

345
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:35,399
One is what you might call, what you might call sort of engaged in the U.S.

346
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,520
behavior.

347
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,640
The other is sort of pretend behavior like, oh, salute to me.

348
00:34:39,640 --> 00:36:16,440
And we just salute you because you're not in a situation where you would normally salute, but we just saluted but you can't do that but we can do that um and then the third is where you do something by mechanically looking at your body now as you have to do it in your forming the intellectual aspect movement there's two to the three and I'm not sure which is well let me go through them again and see if there are any three let's do the saluting one Schneider can salute if he is in the concrete situation in which a salute is required and he can even do it if he can imagine himself into the concrete situation so if he thinks that if he gets into a posture of standing up straight and he thinks presumably the doctor is a general or something and if he gets far enough in that he can just salute because he gets himself into the situation in which that's the the situation requires that of him and it just happens but if he doesn't do that he has to do this other weird thing of doing this meaningless movement in which he has to find his hand by wiggling his body around till he finds his hand moving and then watching it get it up to his head and so forth and that time and that's the trying to salute with an abstract attitude so I think I don't think whether it's attitude or movement makes any difference but if it does real I've always thought that in fact I would have thought their book in terms of abstract and concrete attitude but anyway for the time being unless I discover there's a difference I'm just going to go on talking the way I think about it.

349
00:36:16,439 --> 00:36:18,919
Now, so you now what's the third?

350
00:36:18,919 --> 00:36:37,960
The third is, if I tell you to salute, even though there's no war around and no superior officer, you don't have to figure it all out bit by bit, putting the pieces together until you've got a movement called what looks like a salute.

351
00:36:38,439 --> 00:36:44,520
And you don't have to imagine yourself confronting an officer.

352
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,279
You can just do it.

353
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:50,680
Why you can just do it is a big, big deal question.

354
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,919
And the answer is supposed to be roughly because you're being in the world.

355
00:36:54,919 --> 00:36:58,840
But of course, there's a huge gap there, which they're not going to try to fill today.

356
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,879
But I don't see any problem about that.

357
00:37:01,879 --> 00:37:03,239
There are certainly three things.

358
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:09,159
There's the broken down, concrete behavior, which is too concrete.

359
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:13,239
The broken down abstract behavior, which is too abstract, and what we do.

360
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:16,279
On your page 127, I think.

361
00:37:16,279 --> 00:37:16,759
Okay.

362
00:37:16,759 --> 00:37:29,000
He writes that if I execute the same movement, but without having any presence or even an imaginary partner in mind, and treated as a set of movements in themselves.

363
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:32,039
And then he goes on to describe a sort of robotic movement.

364
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,840
Yeah.

365
00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:34,519
That's like very abstract one.

366
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,439
Yeah, that's what Nair.

367
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:47,640
So then, so then the movement, the pretend movement, when you have an imaginary person or those movements, and the person who's actually presented those opposite concrete things.

368
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,279
No.

369
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,759
Because it's going to make a kind of three-way contrast.

370
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,039
I don't get it yet.

371
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,279
If I make the same movement.

372
00:37:54,759 --> 00:37:55,399
Where are you?

373
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,720
Well, a great sort of importance.

374
00:37:57,879 --> 00:37:59,799
Yeah, it's probably around 127.

375
00:38:01,799 --> 00:38:02,839
Okay, let me just see it.

376
00:38:02,919 --> 00:38:10,359
If I execute well, they move, the Demon's present, or even an imaginary partner, but they're moving to themselves.

377
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,799
That's why you're very funny.

378
00:38:11,799 --> 00:38:20,399
Okay, that bottom thing is Schneider's abstract attitude or abstract movement.

379
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:27,600
They're the one where you make a set of movements and you get your upper arm and your lower arm and you finally get your whole arm up there.

380
00:38:28,399 --> 00:38:30,560
What she's saying is that she comprehenses.

381
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,679
He could do either.

382
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,160
Either.

383
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,839
The way I understand it, Schneider has two options when you tell him to salute.

384
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:58,399
He either imagines himself completely into a situation in which it's just the inevitable that he'll salute because there is a superior officer in front of him and so forth, or he can do it in an abstract way, but then he has to find his hand, find his arm, keep his eye on it, and move it up to where it's in is in the proper relation to his forehead.

385
00:38:58,399 --> 00:38:59,840
He can do both those things.

386
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:08,959
The one thing he can't do is just perform a straightforward, simple salute in a situation in which no, but we're not in the army and there's no officer around.

387
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,239
He can do that.

388
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:12,879
I can just stand right up in front of you and salute.

389
00:39:12,879 --> 00:39:14,720
Maybe I've never tried it.

390
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,160
I'm not going to try it now.

391
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:16,959
It might not work.

392
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,759
So in any case, those are the three possibilities.

393
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:24,160
And Schneider's got two of them.

394
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:47,200
And what's peculiar from Mero-Pontin's point of view, which I understand is trying to keep my head above water, you've got to keep sinking into this or you just lose your wit, is what from what's interesting from Aero-Partin's point of view is how the concrete one and the abstract one are both pathological.

395
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:58,239
And the idea that somehow you could put them together to get the normal one is just completely misguided, but that seems to be what Gells and Goldstein think they that you should do.

396
00:39:58,239 --> 00:39:58,720
Yeah.

397
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:05,720
The two saloon cases you were just describing, is one of those supposed to be concrete or is there an abstract and a breakdown of the abstract?

398
00:40:05,879 --> 00:40:07,239
No, one of them is concrete.

399
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:11,640
I mean, I meant, I hope this is still right.

400
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:19,560
The concrete one is you imagine yourself into a situation so concrete that you just can't help actually saluting.

401
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:28,279
The abstract one is you stand outside of it all, but you turn your body into an object and you find out where your hand is and you find out where your...

402
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,279
That's a breakdown of the abstract.

403
00:40:30,279 --> 00:40:32,839
And the abstract is what we can do that Schneider can't bring.

404
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:39,239
Well, that's all this is so hard because both of them are similarly something we can do.

405
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:48,520
What the Homeric heroes could do, just letting their arm go out to the food in front of them, and that wasn't pathological.

406
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:56,200
And we can describe the loop.

407
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,960
I mean, that's something we can do in this middle way.

408
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:09,319
But you could do something that wasn't pathological but was abstract if I asked you to perform some movement that you're not used to and so forth.

409
00:41:09,319 --> 00:41:11,640
And it needs to be pathological, I think.

410
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:20,279
The trouble is that we don't do that much of either of these things because they're not normal and Schneider has only those two things.

411
00:41:20,279 --> 00:41:25,160
I'm just wondering if there's three categories of something here or two categories and breakdown cases of each kind.

412
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,200
Ah, okay, now I see the point.

413
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:36,439
I think, now, again, oh boy, is that's because you've got to ask you from Gerald-Goldstein's perspective and for marriage hunting.

414
00:41:36,439 --> 00:41:43,160
From Gel-Goldstein's perspective, there are two kinds of movement.

415
00:41:43,759 --> 00:41:51,520
And each of them is, well, I don't know yet.

416
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,319
They seem to be pathological in Schneider.

417
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:55,999
No, I'm not sure.

418
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,119
No, no, maybe not.

419
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,600
Okay, I guess I'm just going to figure this out.

420
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,119
There are two kinds of movement.

421
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:06,160
One of them is you respond to the importance of the concrete situation.

422
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,000
Schneider can do that.

423
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,239
We do that.

424
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:17,440
And it's only pathological if what?

425
00:42:17,759 --> 00:42:24,640
If you are locked into the situation in something like utilization behavior.

426
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,880
Snyder is more like an animal.

427
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,720
An animal can only respond when it's hungry.

428
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,359
They have their food.

429
00:42:31,439 --> 00:42:32,399
It just has to eat it.

430
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,080
Snyder has that.

431
00:42:34,399 --> 00:42:36,959
Now, what would you get from being pathological that way?

432
00:42:36,959 --> 00:42:39,360
Well, you sprinkle in a little abstraction.

433
00:42:39,759 --> 00:42:42,639
The way I think scales and Goldstein thinks about it.

434
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:55,439
I mean, it's only pathological when it totally lacks the ability to not respond to the situation or move from situation to situation.

435
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:56,880
Where would it get that?

436
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,439
It needs a lot of abstract stuff for it.

437
00:42:59,439 --> 00:43:04,960
Then it can begin to move from situation to situation and not get pulled into the situation.

438
00:43:04,959 --> 00:43:08,319
And now comes more of a hard question if you're asking that.

439
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,840
And what is this abstract thing on the side itself?

440
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:21,360
Well, I think the answer would be it would be this weird thing of having to find out well sort of what your goal was, where your body was, and how to get from one to the other.

441
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:22,959
Why don't we normally do that?

442
00:43:23,040 --> 00:44:59,679
We normally don't do that because we've always got a lot of the uh involved uh part thinking yeah and so our normal way of reacting this third way is a mixture of the abstract way and the concrete way I think that's how I understand it and Naroponte thinks that big step ahead of everybody else and hopeful at the same time yeah I don't know if this will help but on the same page I read from before she writes concrete on he writes concrete movement occurs in the realm of being or the actual well rather than to say abstract movement occurs I'm sorry I lost it okay the first adheres to a given background concrete adheres to a given background abstract throws out his own background and he said that same thing in a different way yeah so imaginary behavior like leading to analogous impact is abstract is because you're being at your own background but relatives that made up backgrounds you're engaged with background so I see what you're saying I do have a funny case about Schneider he can I guess it's going to turn out to be important just because it is so complicated I don't think Schneider can just make up a situation of being in the military and having to salute he has to stand erect and he has to get himself in the feeling that he is actually in that situation of course he is imagining it that's what that's what you're adding but he's not imagining it in a way that you and I could imagine it as a situation that we're not really in but we might be in.

443
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:05,119
He somehow has to imagine it so concretely that he's in it.

444
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,160
And he can do that.

445
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:11,519
I don't know why he can do that or how he can do that, but that's the picture if they're not our kind of imagining it.

446
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:24,879
You wouldn't, you can't, you're not going to imagine it in such a way that your arm just automatically goes up in this sort of mechanical way that you would if you were in the army, that he does it that way.

447
00:45:24,879 --> 00:45:25,279
Yeah.

448
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,120
I think why you're scared of birds?

449
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,439
Oh no, oh no, that's very clear.

450
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:32,720
Have you read it?

451
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,439
It says he got a shell in the back of his head in the First World War.

452
00:45:37,439 --> 00:45:38,640
That's what's wrong with him.

453
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,800
There's a piece of his brain is missing.

454
00:45:40,799 --> 00:45:42,560
But he was normal.

455
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,680
And you're absolutely right, I think, in a very interesting question you're asking.

456
00:45:47,759 --> 00:45:49,840
I think the answer is that I can't remember.

457
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:55,279
But the question would be, can he learn new skills now to be related to your thing?

458
00:45:55,279 --> 00:45:57,600
And the answer is, I believe he can.

459
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:09,279
I think it's sort of simplistic in here that he can make his wallets because he already knew how to do that and he can walk home and greet his wife because he's already allowed to be walked.

460
00:46:09,279 --> 00:46:13,759
But you can't sort of, I guess, I don't think, teach him say ping pong at this point.

461
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,160
That's one thing I want to say about it.

462
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,840
Let me see, there was two things in respect to that, just a second.

463
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Let's see how it is.

464
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:30,479
Oh, ah, this one, this speculation I'm going to get to at the end of the lecture, because I don't know the answer to it, and I think it's very intriguing, but a lot of stuff has to be put in place.

465
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,759
Let me go through this for a while.

466
00:46:31,759 --> 00:46:33,519
We're jumping around, which is my fault.

467
00:46:33,919 --> 00:46:38,000
I always want to give you the whole picture before I jump into the details.

468
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:39,999
So we get a whole list.

469
00:46:40,399 --> 00:46:46,000
Let's go back to my 103, which is the first page of the chapter.

470
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,200
Oh, sorry.

471
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,759
I say 103, but I don't mean 103.

472
00:46:49,759 --> 00:46:50,400
You're right.

473
00:46:50,399 --> 00:46:52,320
Oh, it's your page 103.

474
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,239
I've got the two pages in here.

475
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:56,480
I don't know what it is in mine.

476
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:04,119
Yeah, the first thing is when we're starting listing all the other things Snyder can do 184.

477
00:47:04,919 --> 00:47:12,200
There's 106, 103 in my book, but it's 118 or 183.

478
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:18,440
Well, I think having done books is really, as if we're working enough trouble in understanding this.

479
00:47:18,759 --> 00:47:22,039
You have him two books to go back and forth between is really madness.

480
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:28,360
The fact that it's 118, of course, where you get a whole list of the stuff he can do and can't do.

481
00:47:28,359 --> 00:47:32,359
And I don't know whether I think we maybe don't have to read it.

482
00:47:33,319 --> 00:47:36,440
He's unable to perform abstract movements.

483
00:47:37,399 --> 00:47:42,360
He can only do them if you can watch if Williams Wiley does them.

484
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,479
But, yeah, we've just got to get this nice contract.

485
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:52,839
But he's got this normal, or seemingly normal, response to the concrete issues.

486
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:58,680
Even when his eyes are closed, the patient performs in the middle of 118 for the book we read.

487
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:06,039
The patient performs with extraordinary speed and precision, the movements needed in living his life, provided that he's in the habit of performing them.

488
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:17,160
He takes his handkerchief from his pocket and blows his nose, takes his mask out of his box and lights a lamp, and he makes his wallet second almost as well as a normal worker.

489
00:48:17,799 --> 00:48:24,920
And so there is a little further a dissociation of the act of pointing from reactions of taking and grasping.

490
00:48:24,919 --> 00:48:35,560
And of course, the famous paper, which we feel in the background of what we're reading, and what gets mentioned every once in a while, is tiding and driving it pointing and grasping.

491
00:48:35,799 --> 00:48:40,840
The amazing thing about Schneider is he can grasp his nose with no problem at all.

492
00:48:40,839 --> 00:48:46,720
And if he, when he blows his nose or a mosquito lands on his nose, but he can't point to his nose.

493
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:56,560
And the Merrill Punt, well, Gail Colstein and Merrill Pucky are asking the question, what in the world kind of situation was?

494
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:10,960
And the answer seems to be he's got the concrete attitude, which enables him to simply be involved with the situation and do the appropriate thing at the appropriate time in the appropriate way with skill.

495
00:49:10,959 --> 00:49:22,959
But he hasn't got the abstract attitude, which is to sort of stand back and sort of look at himself from a distance and just point at his nose even though there's no reason.

496
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:27,599
Another example, by the way, I think is interesting, which will come up in a minute.

497
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:40,640
Remember, he can go to the door and go out if you tell him to, but he can't go just up to the door and then stop.

498
00:49:40,959 --> 00:49:41,759
And why?

499
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:59,040
Because if you're performing a concrete movement, it's, remember, magically at its end, he can only start to go through the door and go out because of the, he starts to go through the door to go out from the moment he starts going and his hand and his body are all set up like that.

500
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:04,560
And he can do it because he's already pictured, already set to go out.

501
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:18,080
But if you ask him just to go as if he were going to go out the door but stop at the last minute, then he hasn't got the goal magically already ahead of him to organize his behavior, and he can't do it.

502
00:50:18,799 --> 00:50:23,680
In other words, only if he's involved in going out the door can he just go out the door.

503
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:33,080
If you asked him to go up to the door but then just stop a little bit before, that can have strap movement.

504
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:44,279
Then he has to view his movement not as just letting the goal grab him and pull him to where he wants to go, but he has to know where he is at every moment and know where he is when he gets to the door and stops.

505
00:50:44,279 --> 00:50:45,720
He can't do that.

506
00:50:46,279 --> 00:50:47,400
So neat.

507
00:50:48,759 --> 00:50:49,959
And we'll get there.

508
00:50:49,959 --> 00:50:51,479
Why do I keep getting ahead?

509
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,400
There's a lot that he can't do.

510
00:50:54,359 --> 00:50:58,440
He can't stand back and deal with the objective world.

511
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,160
That's what we just seen.

512
00:51:03,399 --> 00:51:06,839
But he can respond to affordances.

513
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:10,040
That's what we've just seen when he blows his nose and so forth.

514
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,879
He can grasp but not point.

515
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:17,880
That's what I just was talking at the bottom of 118.

516
00:51:18,839 --> 00:51:30,360
And the question is: how can he not know where his nose is when it comes to pointing at it and know where it is when it comes to grasping it?

517
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:37,960
And that's because, they say on 119, there's got to be two different kinds of space that he's in.

518
00:51:37,959 --> 00:51:44,279
There's the spatiality of coping and the spatiality of observing an effect.

519
00:51:44,279 --> 00:51:49,800
That you try to conclude, he says, the grasping and touching are different from pointing.

520
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:58,279
But he then has a great question about headlines down on 119.

521
00:51:58,919 --> 00:52:06,040
If I know where my nose is when it's a question of holding it, how can I not know where it is when it's a matter of pointing at it?

522
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:24,080
Then he says, well, then only because there are these two kinds of space, the conscious representational time and giving a certain determinate place to something in the determinate objective world, or the middle 11c.

523
00:52:24,399 --> 00:52:28,160
And he can't do that.

524
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:35,759
because such a representation either is or is not, and it is neutral unambiguously and so forth.

525
00:52:35,759 --> 00:52:45,200
All that's exactly what normal, abstract, detached consciousness can do.

526
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:55,200
But now there has to be another kind of space given to me in an intention to take hold without being given an intention to know.

527
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:01,519
The patient is conscious of his body space in the matrix of habitual action and not an objective space.

528
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:08,800
And that's all this way of describing in traditional philosophical terms what's going on with them.

529
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:11,119
Except that it's what's going on with him.

530
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:24,160
It's the peculiar dissociation of the Cartesian objective world and objective space from the existential, involved, copied world, the coping space.

531
00:53:24,959 --> 00:53:30,160
Well, for us, they could say there together in a way that never really gets clear.

532
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:32,560
Okay, yes.

533
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:38,639
Just very quickly, this is one of the best choices to support the interpretation you were making last time as against me, really.

534
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:43,759
Because from my point of view, you wouldn't think of pointing at something and grasping it would be any different.

535
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:57,479
If it's in terms of a kind of abstract body sensor, you're sensitive space, how it's not trying to actual noteing with the local properties of the thing out there makes a difference to my comprehension of the space, that would seem interesting.

536
00:53:57,439 --> 00:53:59,079
That would be.

537
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:06,680
I guess he would, and he is sort of, I guess, intuitively using it to make something like that point, but I never thought.

538
00:54:07,239 --> 00:54:08,919
Yeah, let me just repeat it.

539
00:54:09,319 --> 00:54:11,319
No, you repeat it, because it's interesting.

540
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,560
So, well, let me try to repeat it.

541
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:30,119
If what we know when we live in and understand space is the way our motions are correlated with what, let me see, action.

542
00:54:30,919 --> 00:54:34,360
What we see is correlated with what we do when we move.

543
00:54:34,839 --> 00:55:17,720
And we have the whole, if the body schema were an understanding of all of what Alva calls in his papers the sensory motor contingencies, that is how a certain action will bring about a certain experience, then if that's what it is to understand sort of perception and action, then it ought to be the case that you couldn't separate the way Schneider, a sense of relation, an abstract sense of the relation of action, of perception and action, from an involved sense of perception and action.

544
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:34,319
They would be the same kind of, they would be just, there would be one understanding, and it would be, you would have all the, your body would know all the sensory motor contingencies and declare and the idea that you could know them in one respect.

545
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:45,040
How does it go here, that you could know them in a way objectively without knowing them involvedly seems maybe missing from that.

546
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:45,839
That's good.

547
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:46,959
That's very interesting.

548
00:55:46,959 --> 00:55:47,359
Yeah.

549
00:55:48,959 --> 00:55:59,200
It seems like this whole Schneider paper starts to really implode the time of work on the empiricism that somehow both sides have doomed to fail too late.

550
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:09,439
I feel like this might be one of those processes where, you know, maybe one maybe empiricist can explain the concrete motion with like the reflex theory, which is association, you know, the intellectuals can think.

551
00:56:09,439 --> 00:56:11,279
Neither side could explain the other.

552
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:17,839
Therefore, neither that case in Schneider can put a new ah, well I have to think about that.

553
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:19,439
That's an interesting proposal.

554
00:56:19,439 --> 00:56:20,479
Let me see.

555
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:35,519
I mean, I'm not sure what exactly the argument is, but I feel like throughout this section, he really wants to use Schneider as a way to explain exactly how empiricism and intellectualism must fail.

556
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:42,640
And that with things that you can think of, I think the Goldstein is that he wants to be a kind of view of intellectualism and empiricism.

557
00:56:42,879 --> 00:56:46,479
Yeah, and I think that's intriguing, what you're saying.

558
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,560
Could you hear him back there?

559
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:53,039
Okay, I don't know what to think about it, just for the only for the following reason.

560
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:59,999
That Joe Goldstein being enough of consultants have certainly the idea of responding to affordances.

561
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,879
It's not strictly mechanical what he does when he blows his nose or makes things wall or something.

562
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:08,880
Right.

563
00:57:08,879 --> 00:57:13,279
So but you'll be very happy with trying to account for concrete movements.

564
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,319
That's right.

565
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:28,600
But but it isn't as if he thinks that, Merrill Ponty thinks that the Yellow-Goldstein distinction between concrete and abstract movement is the same as the distinction between what the empiricist can explain and what the intellectuals can explain, though it's close.

566
00:57:28,399 --> 00:57:30,359
That's why I'm worrying about it.

567
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:36,279
Well, I guess there's an empiricist in which I understand where I know.

568
00:57:36,279 --> 00:57:39,879
But then there's also an intellectualist and to which I understand and go where I know.

569
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:46,359
Starting from one understanding, you can't account for the extraction and sniper.

570
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:49,399
Okay, I feel like not being able to.

571
00:57:49,879 --> 00:57:51,720
I guess that's that's good.

572
00:57:52,040 --> 00:58:08,920
I mean, that says that there's a challenge to the empiricist to explain how we can point at our nose, and a challenge to the intellectualist to explain how we can make it to hit our nose or blow our nose even when we can't point to it.

573
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,319
I think that's right.

574
00:58:11,319 --> 00:58:19,559
I'm just trying to kind of think about how much of the concrete attitude as Yellow Goldstein wanted to be the empiricist can understand.

575
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:20,680
And that's a different example.

576
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:21,079
Yeah.

577
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,839
I wanted to think of easy to do this.

578
00:58:22,839 --> 00:58:22,999
Okay.

579
00:58:24,359 --> 00:58:26,039
It's going to be doing the failure to come out.

580
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:26,279
All right.

581
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:32,039
The intellectualist is what Yellow and Goldstein are going to try to easily do.

582
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,000
And that feels a bit different.

583
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:34,920
Yes.

584
00:58:34,919 --> 00:58:35,319
Okay.

585
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:36,840
That's right.

586
00:58:38,279 --> 00:58:39,640
Let's go back to this.

587
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,079
I bear that in mind.

588
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:47,000
The more you can use the intellectualist empiricist sort of framework as a guide, the better.

589
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:51,320
So there's the objective body in Cartesian space.

590
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,160
We talked about that.

591
00:58:55,239 --> 00:59:14,880
Then there's the body which is not in Cartesian space, where I have this sense of where my body is so that I can swat a mosquito anywhere on my body without having to figure out where the mosquito is and where my land is and bringing them together in objective space.

592
00:59:14,879 --> 00:59:20,000
And I think that's what I want to say about that for a minute.

593
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:31,840
I see where he can't, this is where he, on 119 at the top, is where if you tell him that he can't arrive at his goal, he can't even start.

594
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:36,000
This is where it was from the outset, about four lines down.

595
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:39,759
From the outset, the grasping movement is magically its completion.

596
00:59:39,759 --> 00:59:41,200
This is again what you see here.

597
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:50,000
You can begin only by anticipating its end, since you disallow taking hold if position to inhibit the action.

598
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:56,000
That is, if you can't go all the way and knock on the door or turn the door knob, then you can't even start.

599
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:05,680
If all you had was the concrete kind of movement, of course, we can do it.

600
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:20,320
We can go to the door and stop on a command because we aren't limited to doing only the way that we are related to the door when we're responding to the importance of the door and letting it draw the action out of us.

601
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,600
We do that, but we don't have to do that.

602
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,320
Whereas Snyder can only do that.

603
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,799
Okay, this is the same point, but it's a leave.

604
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,159
You've got to say it over and over.

605
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,120
So there's two different ways to move the body.

606
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:35,120
I can move it as an object.

607
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:48,000
With some difficulty, I can represent my objective body and represent the objective success conditions, whatever it is I'm trying to do, and then bring them together and and and do it.

608
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:58,640
This is what happens on 120, where he talks about if he isn't in the situation, then what happens is this very objective kind of...

609
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:09,639
So Schneider, about 50 lines, the patient must first of all find his own, the gesture called for and so forth and so forth.

610
01:01:10,359 --> 01:01:14,919
We don't need to do that because, why?

611
01:01:14,919 --> 01:01:20,759
Because we are always in, or we can be in this practical situation.

612
01:01:20,759 --> 01:01:24,839
And he can do it if he's in a practical situation.

613
01:01:24,839 --> 01:01:38,120
What he can do is do this objective thing of keeping, of imagining easily how to do something without arriving at a goal and do something he isn't in the right situation to do.

614
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:48,759
He has to do that with pure abstract motion, which is this awkward thing of trying to find himself in objective space and move to where he's going.

615
01:01:48,759 --> 01:01:49,079
Yeah.

616
01:01:49,399 --> 01:01:51,880
Can Schneider point to the door?

617
01:01:52,919 --> 01:01:54,920
No, I think not.

618
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:58,360
I mean, it would follow not as far as I can see.

619
01:01:58,919 --> 01:02:01,560
He can go to the door and go out of it.

620
01:02:01,879 --> 01:02:05,239
But can he point to, I don't think so.

621
01:02:05,239 --> 01:02:08,840
But partly the problem with Schneider is he's practically blind.

622
01:02:08,839 --> 01:02:11,720
You read later on, if you've gone that far.

623
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:12,519
That's the trouble.

624
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:18,759
I mean, he's lost so much of his brain that it's not clear just what these different deficits mean.

625
01:02:18,759 --> 01:02:23,080
Maybe he can't even see the door, except as a kind of blob.

626
01:02:23,399 --> 01:02:38,840
But I think that if he were a pure case of total involved, a concrete movement with no abstract movement, he couldn't point at the door.

627
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:44,239
Keep your eyes open to see if there's any evidence for this.

628
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:47,600
I don't remember any place where he talks about it.

629
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:49,279
It wouldn't be so dramatic.

630
01:02:49,759 --> 01:02:56,319
I mean, if he can't, it seems like if he can grasp his nose and can't point at it, then why should he be able to point at the door?

631
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:58,560
If he could go grasp the door, he shouldn't point at it.

632
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,640
So, and that's probably what you want here.

633
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,039
Okay, I'm with you.

634
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,480
I think that's right.

635
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:11,599
Okay, so then I can make these concrete movements in which I respond to the importances in the world.

636
01:03:11,919 --> 01:03:13,920
That's the other way.

637
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:15,999
Then I don't have to find my arm.

638
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,120
I just do it.

639
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:24,879
Responding at the top of 120, either to the actual situation or putting yourself, imagining yourself in the actual situation is all he needs.

640
01:03:24,879 --> 01:03:26,239
Then he can do it.

641
01:03:27,439 --> 01:03:29,039
121.

642
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:33,520
Now this is where you can swap the mosquito that steamson in the middle of 121.

643
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:34,959
And that's so interesting to me.

644
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:41,359
Because Meryl-Ponty says there, he finds straight away because where the mosquito is and plastic.

645
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:53,520
Because for him, there's no question of locating it, it's the bite place, in the coordinates of objective space, but of reaching with his phenomenal hand a certain painful spot on his phenomenal body.

646
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:57,439
The whole operation, skipping a little, takes place in the domain of the phenomenal.

647
01:03:57,439 --> 01:04:00,160
It does not run through the objective world.

648
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:07,520
I read that to you because, I mean, I've been reading Meryl-Fonte for years, getting glimmers of why it's interesting and plausible and important.

649
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:13,600
This was really important to me when I was at MIT, and I thought, gee, that's interesting.

650
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:30,679
Because they have a robot arm, which, and it was connected to a camera, and the camera shows the robot arm where something, you train the camera on something, and again, methodological shooting is supposed to go on, and the robot arm is supposed to go over and reach it or pick it up.

651
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:38,040
And I thought, gee, that's exactly like the not having the concrete attitude.

652
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:58,200
That would mean that it's like, that would be like sliding a mosquito bike by figuring out where in objective space the pain was on your arm or the mosquito and where in objective space your hand was, and then doing an immense calculation with all the degrees of freedom in your shoulder, in your elbow, in your wrist, in your hand, if trying to figure out how to get your hand from here over to here.

653
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,799
That would be very hard.

654
01:04:59,799 --> 01:05:03,640
So I said, I don't think they're ever going to be able to do their robot project.

655
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:04,439
And they didn't.

656
01:05:04,439 --> 01:05:17,560
They never could solve those huge amount of simultaneous equations that would be needed to find, to move the arm in objective space when object that it is seen in the camera has seen in objective space.

657
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:21,079
There are now ways to do it using neural networks, but that's all right.

658
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:24,759
They don't solve the problem in objective space.

659
01:05:24,759 --> 01:05:34,279
But Merrill Fonte sort of turned me on to that in the fact that you could see, you could see the device with our way of doing it.

660
01:05:34,279 --> 01:05:38,119
It's not finding ourselves in physical space.

661
01:05:38,439 --> 01:05:40,279
Okay, let me go on here.

662
01:05:42,759 --> 01:05:57,080
Okay, here's the stuff on 122, which we read already, I think, yes, where for him, he just sits at his desk and the scissors and the leather and everything just pulled him in and elicited necessary movements.

663
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,359
I'm reading that.

664
01:05:59,959 --> 01:06:08,120
And the typical resolve thing, he wanted to get his motor reactions established the most effective balance between all these actions.

665
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:13,080
That's the maximum grip talk, again, in kind of minimal form.

666
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:14,880
And he can do that.

667
01:06:15,759 --> 01:06:23,360
By the way, I just noted for those who've had Searle, and there's something interesting going on here.

668
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:28,239
There's the question, when your...

669
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:39,600
mind decides to do something as a goal, it makes an intentional movement, is it moving your phenomenal body or is it moving your body in objective space?

670
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:40,879
That may have worries you.

671
01:06:40,879 --> 01:06:41,759
It worries him.

672
01:06:41,759 --> 01:06:52,799
If you look at the bottom, the above 121, it's not a question of how the soul, that's just the mind, acts on the objective body, since it's not down the ladder that it acts, but on the phenomenal body.

673
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:55,440
So the question has to be refrained.

674
01:06:55,439 --> 01:07:06,559
So I think when the intention to act reaches down and governs the bodily movement, is it the phenomenal bodily movement or is it the bodily movement in Cartesian space?

675
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:07,999
I think that's a problem.

676
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:09,120
That's what I think.

677
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,880
And he thinks that's a big problem.

678
01:07:10,879 --> 01:07:16,479
And somehow he thinks the answer to this problem, there's a sort of paper topic in here if you had Searle.

679
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:21,759
And does the answer to this problem, how do you answer it?

680
01:07:21,759 --> 01:07:24,959
By saying, well, you're not moving your arm in objective space.

681
01:07:24,959 --> 01:07:28,160
You're moving your phenomenal arm in phenomenal space.

682
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,119
Is that an answer that Searle could accept?

683
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:33,119
Is that a devastating criticism?

684
01:07:34,399 --> 01:07:35,439
He wouldn't accept that.

685
01:07:35,439 --> 01:07:40,000
Any more than he thinks that your pain is in your foot, if he thinks your pain is in your brain.

686
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,720
Okay, the same problem is there.

687
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:43,999
And so is the footnote.

688
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:53,199
I remember I said I would tell you the footnote where he's talking about reaching down and governing in a way that is exactly like the criticism of Searle.

689
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:59,879
I don't want to spend a lot of time on this because I know it's only interests some of you, but it's definitely ought to interest some of you.

690
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:00,919
Where are we?

691
01:08:00,919 --> 01:08:06,600
Okay, 138 in ours and 139.

692
01:08:07,799 --> 01:08:10,279
Uh-oh, 138 and 139 in Mitchell.

693
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,400
Give us a contortion.

694
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,560
It's 138, 139 in yours.

695
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:16,199
And it is 160, 161.

696
01:08:16,199 --> 01:08:19,079
Okay, 160, 161.

697
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,199
It is?

698
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:20,919
No?

699
01:08:21,079 --> 01:08:22,439
We have a problem.

700
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:23,879
Where are we?

701
01:08:23,879 --> 01:08:24,440
Sorry.

702
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,759
Not in my book, in the old lines?

703
01:08:26,999 --> 01:08:27,239
Yeah.

704
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:28,440
Anyway, I found it.

705
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:29,879
I don't know what the right story is.

706
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,520
Maybe I said something wrong about it somewhere.

707
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:37,079
138, 139 in the old book is what I want.

708
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:39,720
And that's now tell me where that is in the new book.

709
01:08:40,759 --> 01:08:42,520
159 and 160.

710
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,640
Okay, let's try that.

711
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:44,839
161.

712
01:08:44,839 --> 01:08:46,839
Yes, that's right.

713
01:08:46,839 --> 01:08:54,919
And that's all about how the representation of the movement can cause the movement.

714
01:08:54,919 --> 01:08:57,239
That's two footnotes on that subject.

715
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:05,079
And he seems to be really exactly worrying about something, well, something like, anyway, Searle's position on this.

716
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:10,600
And he says it arises because of the dualism of consciousness and objective body.

717
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:16,199
And then there's going to be a problem of how consciousness moves the objective body.

718
01:09:16,199 --> 01:09:28,119
And he says that it's a magical process at the end of the footnote on one on your footnote on 160.

719
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:35,159
And there, and this is where magical is a kind of insult and not a placeholder for science.

720
01:09:35,159 --> 01:09:42,839
We still need to understand by what magical process the representation of a movement causes precisely that movement to be made by the body.

721
01:09:42,839 --> 01:09:51,520
The problem can only be solved provided we cease to draw a distinction between the body as a mechanism in itself and consequences of being for itself.

722
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:52,799
I think very.

723
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:57,119
Okay, so now back to where we were.

724
01:09:58,959 --> 01:10:11,119
Ah, oh yeah, I had fun trying to just explain the fact that when he's talking about Schneider, it makes his experiences sound very strange.

725
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,359
We're back on 122.

726
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:17,039
But it isn't as if we're not like Schneider some of the time.

727
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:22,239
In fact, we're sometimes like, I mean, I think we're like Schneider when we're sometimes at our best.

728
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:36,399
And I just want to remind you, besides the Homer talk of the warrior's arm going out to the food in front of them, which sounds just like 122, that is elicited to make the necessary movement by the whole system of what's there.

729
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:43,279
You can have it again in the example I've used in some paper I wrote in a tennis game.

730
01:10:43,759 --> 01:11:03,199
If you're involved in the game and if you have the skill and so forth, then the other person and the way they're moving and the sound of the ball that was hit and the way the ball seems to be moving will just pull you to a part of the court and your arm to a rest, to how much the racket's going to be slanted and so forth.

731
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:05,039
Your body schema is going to do all that.

732
01:11:05,039 --> 01:11:06,399
You couldn't do that.

733
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:11,999
You couldn't figure out where to run and least of all know how much you turn your racket and how fast to move it.

734
01:11:11,999 --> 01:11:25,199
All of that gets figured out by the body schema and you just have to do whatever this gets just you the necessary movements are just elicited from you by the whole discoverer the tennis game.

735
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:44,919
In fact the tennis game, I thought I'd made it up uh as an example that he thought he has it in the structure of behavior as an example just what i just said how the the gestalt of the if you have a skill if you stall through the whole course court and everything will make your body do what needs to be done.

736
01:11:44,919 --> 01:11:50,119
And I just want to say all that because it isn't as if we don't behave like Schneider.

737
01:11:50,119 --> 01:11:58,520
And another one I wanted to mention that, well, just Shaboto 121, I'm still explaining this.

738
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:02,199
It's never our objective body that we move, but our phenomenal body.

739
01:12:02,199 --> 01:12:13,399
And there is no mystery in that since our body has the potentiality for this or that part of the world, surges towards objects, the objects to be grasped and perceives them.

740
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,319
That's life.

741
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:25,399
And I wanted to say, and more, and interestingly enough, if there isn't an object there, sometimes we can't make the movement.

742
01:12:26,999 --> 01:12:41,560
I decided to take an example where we are totally like Schneider, where we would have to figure out abstractly how to do something, which as long as we're in the situation we can do perfectly easily.

743
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:44,519
And there's a famous example that I didn't make this up.

744
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:49,399
Ask yourself, how do you type the letter E on a touch keyboard?

745
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,480
Which finger do you use?

746
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:52,439
And so forth.

747
01:12:52,440 --> 01:13:00,439
Well, if you're like me, you have no idea that if you sit down at the keyboard, the right finger will go to the right key.

748
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,919
And it isn't even enough to try to imagine it.

749
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:05,319
I mean some people, I think, say they can.

750
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:08,680
They can solve this problem and say, oh, I understand.

751
01:13:08,839 --> 01:13:13,199
Imagine I'm typing the word T-H-E, and I'll find out which finger types to Z.

752
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,399
I can't do it.

753
01:13:13,159 --> 01:13:16,640
I don't know if some of you can, probably some of you can't.

754
01:13:16,879 --> 01:13:27,199
But if you're Schneider enough like, and I guess I am, the only way to find, to do it, to be able to type the letter E is to be actually in front of the keyboard.

755
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:28,560
Even imagining.

756
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,039
Certainly, you can't do it without imagining the keyboard.

757
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:32,720
That's already like Schneider.

758
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:35,439
And I think you're even more like Schneider, perhaps.

759
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:38,399
If you can't, maybe I should give you a harder letter like Z.

760
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:45,279
Just try to, just by sheer imagining when you're typing Z for see if you can figure out which finger types through Z.

761
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:51,199
I just want you to have a sense of it, that that's what it's like to be Schneider all the time.

762
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:55,999
Was that the Z finger?

763
01:13:56,079 --> 01:13:58,239
Oh, well, you've got a helpful hand.

764
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:00,239
But it's in your hand.

765
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,600
I like that example.

766
01:14:01,919 --> 01:14:02,480
That one.

767
01:14:02,959 --> 01:14:05,119
In fact, I want to put on reserve.

768
01:14:05,119 --> 01:14:08,879
This is another parenthetical that's almost got my better favorite.

769
01:14:08,879 --> 01:14:20,879
I'm going to put on reserve a book called Waves of the Hand by a guy named Suttnow, who taught himself to be a jazz pianist and describes an excruciating failure for a whole book, the stages he went through.

770
01:14:20,879 --> 01:14:27,519
But what's interesting is at the end of it, where he talks about how his hands now know jazz.

771
01:14:27,919 --> 01:14:29,680
He can't reach for the right notes.

772
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,600
He's not a typewriter thing again.

773
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,999
But his hands can reach for the notes.

774
01:14:33,999 --> 01:14:39,119
And that's again a lot of the thing, thinking about it's the body, my body.

775
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:43,039
The title of the book, Waves of the Hand, is exactly right.

776
01:14:43,039 --> 01:14:45,600
It's not sort of waves of my hand having words.

777
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,119
Dave Suttnow is out of it.

778
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:53,279
When he's doing his jazz right, he's in his hand.

779
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,359
And that's quite the typing thing.

780
01:14:55,360 --> 01:15:10,279
There's nothing special to work up if you need to look at this book, but if you look at the last part of the book, you'll just see somebody sort of sensitively describing this phenomenon, which anybody will have when they acquire any skill, that their body will finally take over and do it.
