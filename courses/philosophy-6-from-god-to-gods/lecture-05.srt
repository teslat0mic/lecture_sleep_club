1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,119
Well, they're very laid back like the Phoenicians or with like at Menelaus's with the opium in the drinks.

2
00:00:07,119 --> 00:00:11,120
And yet, when they're laid back, what do they want?

3
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:16,960
They want to hear the about the war heroes, about the strenuous episodes.

4
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:28,079
Their dinners would be much less meaningful and interesting if they weren't didn't have the harpers to sing to them about the great heroes and gods of the culture.

5
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:42,080
And the life of the warriors ten years i in besieging Troy would be a lot less interesting if they didn't already picture themselves sung about at the banquets when they get back or if they don't get back.

6
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,519
So that's a way in which each of these is on that background of the other.

7
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:50,400
When the warriors are there, in the background are the banquets.

8
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,040
When the banquet people are there, in the background are the great heroes in the war.

9
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,599
That's a wonderful way to do things.

10
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,800
The question is, is that can we generalize that?

11
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,040
Can you see that in the life of the great Odyssey himself?

12
00:01:05,039 --> 00:01:07,359
That will be the interesting test.

13
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:14,319
So he visits lots of worlds and gets in sync with lots of them.

14
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:28,399
But the two most important worlds in his life are the later adventurer, leaving home kind of world, and the king, a father, husband, domestic kind of world.

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:38,960
Now what I want to show in the next eight minutes is that these two worlds, the domestic world and the adventurer world, are radically different.

16
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,799
And yet Homer is so interesting and amazing.

17
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,879
He keeps them in the background of each other.

18
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,879
And thereby sort of shows in the way he tells his story.

19
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:56,719
And that makes each of them richer and more meaningful than if they were just by themselves.

20
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,960
Okay, let's, I want to show you that now.

21
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,480
And it's a fascinating thing in Homer.

22
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,400
Let's see again.

23
00:02:03,559 --> 00:02:04,759
Where is he?

24
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,799
Okay, it's in the story of the two olive trees.

25
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,159
I think I can do it before the end of the hour.

26
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,359
Let's see.

27
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:22,680
Homer shows how the adventure world and the home world relate to each other in giving a story of two beds.

28
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,919
I doubt if you remember it the first time through, but there's two important beds in the book.

29
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:36,279
The first one is the world, the bed of the adventurer, on 94 and 95.

30
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,720
And there he comes out of the ocean.

31
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:40,999
He's been swimming and swimming.

32
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,959
He's exhausted.

33
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,240
He's covered with brine.

34
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,239
He's conquered by the sea.

35
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,920
And he crawls on the riverbank.

36
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,599
And then at the bottom of 94, he was trying to figure out what to do.

37
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,640
So he thought it over.

38
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:01,400
And he's made his way to a grove above the water on open ground and crept under twin bushes growing from the same spot.

39
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,240
Olive and wild olive.

40
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,439
That's no coincidence.

41
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:07,319
The olive is the tree of Athena, it turns out.

42
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:11,400
And that there should be a domestic and a wild olive is quite amazing.

43
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:21,159
But it turns out it's sort of already expressing the combination of the two things, the wild olive and the sort of cultivated olive.

44
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,400
But you see it more in a minute.

45
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,200
So here he is, and he was not.

46
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:32,599
He makes a bunch of leaves together, a bed enough for two men, a king-sized bed there in the bitter cold.

47
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:38,840
And his heart laughed when he saw his leaf bed, and down he lay, heaping more leaves above him.

48
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,159
A man in a distant field, no hearth fires near.

49
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:49,200
There you get an echo of what he would be like to be at home, which comes in in the metaphor, which is very important.

50
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,319
No hearth fires near.

51
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,239
We'll hide a fresh brand in a bed of embers to keep a spark alive.

52
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:01,840
So just as did this, and Athena, of course, of being a god, showers sleep upon him.

53
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:10,319
And there you get sort of the, he goes to sleep in the adventurer's bed, which requires ingenuity and only for one night.

54
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,159
And he doesn't know where he is.

55
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,520
And he's all alone.

56
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,960
He has no wife to smooth his bed the way Helen does for Menelaus.

57
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,520
So, and then what happens?

58
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,319
Well, let's go quickly to 435 when he's home.

59
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:38,960
That's the other bed, of course, the very amazing bed that's made out of a tree, an olive tree, a domestic olive tree, growing in the middle of the island.

60
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:46,000
You can think of it this way: the adventurer goes from bed to bed over the horizon to more and more adventures.

61
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:50,719
But the structure of this other bed is: here's his olive tree.

62
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:57,039
Around it, he makes his bed, around it, his bedroom, around it, his castle, around it, his island.

63
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:00,800
It's absolutely stable and censored.

64
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,800
And he made it that way on purpose at the middle of 435.

65
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:11,599
He built this bed, and that old trunk of olive grew like a pillar below the middle of 435.

66
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:16,640
And I laid out our bedroom around that tree and so forth and so forth.

67
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,840
And then, I want to be sure and finish it, so I'm rushing to do this.

68
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,720
Okay, well, I can say it right off.

69
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:30,920
So there he is, finally, in the domestic bed, which is just the opposite.

70
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:33,640
It doesn't require any ingenuity.

71
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,000
It's not different every night.

72
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:36,279
It's the same every night.

73
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:37,719
It's completely.

74
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:42,119
Now I want to go back to the old 435 where I, no, where was I?

75
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:44,840
It was the second 95.

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,239
Right, I want to relate it to what the list of things I said about it before.

77
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:51,000
Okay, it's only for one night.

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,359
He doesn't know where, he knows it's for every night and he knows where he is.

79
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:56,439
And he's got his wife with him there.

80
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,159
Now, how are these two related?

81
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:03,319
Well, Homer, I can only tell you sort of literarily how they're related.

82
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,080
But the question is: has he forgotten the adventurer bed?

83
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,200
Or does that make this bed even more wonderful for him?

84
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:18,119
Just as when he was in the adventurer's bed, he was thinking about what he missed the hearth bed, the home bed.

85
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:34,679
Well, this is this moving thing at the bottom of 436, when they finally get together, when she finally admits that she's, that when she finally admits to herself and to him that she knows he's Odysseus, because he tells her the story of how he built the bed.

86
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:42,120
And then, now at the bottom of 436, now from his breast into his eyes, the ache of longing mounted, and he wept at last.

87
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:52,440
His dear wife, clear, knows how important it is to be clear, clear and faithful, equal in his arms, longed for, and now the amazing thing.

88
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,880
See if this sounds familiar.

89
00:06:53,879 --> 00:07:03,239
As the sun-warmed earth is longed for by a swimmer, bent in rough water, where his ship went down under Poseidon's blows, gale winds, and tons of sea.

90
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:12,760
Few men can keep alive through a big surf to crawl, clotted with brine, on kindly beaches, enjoy, joy, knowing the abyss behind.

91
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,880
What is that?

92
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:59,279
That's the story of the other bed, the adventurer bed, which Homer's bringing in in the background, so to speak, at the moment when he's in the opposite, the absolute opposite, the home bed, and the idea that Homer could somehow keep that together, in this case by a metaphor, but presumably that metaphor expresses this interesting way: that the soldiers and the banqueters, and all the people, I bet, if you work it out, are always, when they're in one world, have all sense of other worlds on the horizon of that world, outside that world, but their being there contributes to the meaningfulness and seriousness of whatever world they're in.

93
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,039
That's an amazingly interesting frame of mind.

94
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,240
Okay, we did it.

95
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:05,359
That one more thing.

96
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:12,640
That means to be sure and read this because I'm going on to the Oristea, and it would be better if you also started reading the Oristea for next time if you can.

97
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:13,919
Okay.

98
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:15,359
Now.

99
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,800
Is it still on?

100
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:17,520
Yes.

101
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,159
I could meet with you sometime before you're starting or on Thursday.

102
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,640
Or class Friday, no, we can make some other appointment, though.

103
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,520
But before class, I'm going to kind of dream of trying to get it all in my head.

104
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,840
But take a time.

105
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,239
When is on Friday afternoon or Monday afternoon?

106
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,800
Are you three?

107
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,599
You've got some time?

108
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,120
On Friday afternoon.

109
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:43,600
Okay.

110
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,719
Okay, let me look and I go first.

111
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:50,960
I have to miss all.

112
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:58,600
So maybe file is the same thing.

113
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:11,080
They're not going to be a big one.
