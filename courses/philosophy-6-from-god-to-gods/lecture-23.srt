1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:45,800
I don't want to go back to what we talked about last time, which I think is very important, but we did cover it, that the disappearance of Virgil and Beatrice showing up in the role of Jesus and all the amazing implications of that for a kind of new theology that Dante is working out and won't really get fully worked out until much later with Protestant and particularly Kierkegaard, where Kierkegaard really makes it work in a way that we'll see Dante doesn't finally get it all fitted together.

2
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,360
So, anyway, we're going to follow the way it goes here in the Paradiso.

3
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,761
So, first you have to just, let's just sort of get ourselves reconnected.

4
00:00:57,321 --> 00:01:13,481
I mentioned it already several times, but you have this have this picture in mind that the purgatory is sticking out on one side of the earth and made out of the dirt from the hell which is in the middle of the earth.

5
00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:32,360
And now you have to start thinking about what's outside of all that, which is on the back of the handout, the first handout that you some of you probably don't have with you now, or you should have, because it was clear that's what we were going to discuss.

6
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:38,601
Anyway, they take off, so to speak, from the top of purgatory.

7
00:01:38,601 --> 00:01:43,240
But where they take off to is sort of necessarily unclear.

8
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,761
And Dante has to deal with that.

9
00:01:46,761 --> 00:02:02,481
That is, the picture he has of the universe is that around the Earth there are all these crystalline spheres that are totally transparent, and in that sphere is embedded one of these heavenly bodies, the moon.

10
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,601
You see the list.

11
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,960
There are eight of them, eight spheres, one outside of the other.

12
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:17,120
And they go from the moon to Mercury to Venus, the sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the stars.

13
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:25,840
The planets, just so you don't get confused, and it's sort of fun to realize how different things were in those days.

14
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,280
A planet was what moved around in the sky.

15
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,800
So there were two candidates for planets that we now don't think of as planets anymore.

16
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:36,080
What would they be?

17
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,480
What moves around in the night sky or the day sky for that matter?

18
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,321
The moon, one of them, that was a planet, because it's the bottom planet.

19
00:02:44,321 --> 00:02:45,520
And what else?

20
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,481
The sun.

21
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:53,920
Right, so the sun and the moon get in there with Venus and Mercury and Mars and Jupiter and Saturn all the way to the same old ones.

22
00:02:53,921 --> 00:03:00,001
And then the stars are those that don't move or have moved very, very, very slowly.

23
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:06,240
And they are, they're outside, the furthest outside sphere.

24
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:15,040
Then outside of that is where their astronomy and ours leave off together, stops having anything in common.

25
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:24,001
There's where the angels are, and the prime mover sphere, that's number nine.

26
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:31,440
That sphere turns, and when it turns, it turns all the others, so that all these planets move around the way they do.

27
00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:38,800
And then there's this special place, which isn't even a place, which is heaven, the Empirean.

28
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:44,800
And there, there is the Trinity, the angels, the saints, and at the center of it is God.

29
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:58,040
You've got a picture of it in the Paradiso, which you don't have a copy of, but I was going to hand out a copy if I had known that there was a blank page there.

30
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,321
I would have put this on it.

31
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:01,080
Maybe I'll give it out next time.

32
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,321
There is, well, you have the paradis.

33
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,321
Wait, no, yeah, but this is the paradiso.

34
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:25,321
Anyway, there's a picture of this huge rose, like a big, big stadium in which God is in the center, and all the people who've gotten to paradise sit around and we're sort of like the bleachers and are blissed out by the radiance of God.

35
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:28,360
We'll get to that by the end of today.

36
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,361
That's where Dante gets by the end of his journey.

37
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,001
So let's see.

38
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:38,520
So there are the spheres and the planets and the so forth in this sort of super amphitheater.

39
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:45,321
And now, so Dante and Beatrice are ready to go there.

40
00:04:45,321 --> 00:04:50,520
And when they are, they literally take off like rockets.

41
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:58,121
They just have to, so to speak, relax, and they are pulled toward God.

42
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,881
Oh, I forgot one important thing.

43
00:04:59,881 --> 00:05:00,921
I knew there was something.

44
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:19,960
There's this sort of topological puzzle that God is, from the point of view of sort of the earth and material things, the furthest outside sphere, the most spiritual, but in a way farthest away.

45
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:29,720
But as the creator of the whole creation and the source of all the movement in the creation, God is in a spiritual way the center.

46
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,720
So God is in a kind of material way, well, the material center is Satan.

47
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:43,920
The heavy, material, unspiritual things fall down toward the center of the earth, and that's the center of the creation.

48
00:05:43,921 --> 00:05:47,280
And at the very center of the earth is Satan.

49
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:57,520
But the spiritual center of it all, whose radiance makes everything move and who attracts everything from, so to speak, all corners of the creation, is God.

50
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:05,600
So there's a way that they're moving out toward the margin as they take off from the top of purgatory.

51
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:18,400
But Dante performs a kind of flip in here, which you don't read, in which he sort of just starts writing as not as if they were going out, but as if they were going in, because they are heading toward the center.

52
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,520
And the spiritual center is this big space around God.

53
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:37,520
But in this sort of chart that you've got, it's told from the point of view of the earth, not from the point of view of somebody on a kind of spiritual, mystical journey to see God.

54
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,761
So there, it looks like God is out there on the outside.

55
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,201
There are things just you have to explain just to sort of understand what's going on.

56
00:06:47,201 --> 00:06:50,561
So God is really the center of everything, of the creation.

57
00:06:50,561 --> 00:06:56,241
I may have said this once, but I'll say it again because I was going through my notes correcting it just now again.

58
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,680
I used to say the universe.

59
00:06:57,681 --> 00:07:01,441
Did I apologize and take back talking about the universe?

60
00:07:01,441 --> 00:07:03,041
I forget whether I ever did.

61
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:09,281
But it dawned on me a few courses back that the universe is our term.

62
00:07:09,281 --> 00:07:18,041
It's still like Dante, and that the universe is one unified something or other, obeying the laws of physics, presumably.

63
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:20,840
But they don't have an idea of the universe.

64
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:31,721
That's sort of physics and astronomy, and it leaves out the most important thing about whatever it is we're in, and that is that it was all created by God.

65
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:38,360
So we should really always talk about the creation when we talk from within the Dante picture, not the universe.

66
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,601
The universe is a modern thing.

67
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,080
And the cosmos is a Greek thing.

68
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,561
It's not the universe or the creation.

69
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:46,840
It's something that is eternal.

70
00:07:46,921 --> 00:07:50,041
It's sort of a structure which is eternal.

71
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:57,241
And whereas the universe may well have begun with the Big Bang, we don't, that's what it looks like now.

72
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,801
Anyway, so here we are.

73
00:07:59,801 --> 00:08:03,801
Everything is created by God, and it's all unified.

74
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:08,521
And the best way to describe it is that God is the center of the creation.

75
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,960
He's the creator.

76
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,721
And he's the supreme being.

77
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,041
All of that is part of the same picture.

78
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,001
So now we're going to go start.

79
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:32,041
So now keep in front of you the handout, which has this picture we were just talking about of all the levels on the first page.

80
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,201
We're now on the back of the first page.

81
00:08:34,201 --> 00:08:37,720
There's a kind of glitch here that I just have to tell you.

82
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:40,600
I didn't want to make them have to Xerox it all over.

83
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,121
Whoever Xeroxed it just cut off the top of the page.

84
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,960
If it had cut off any Dante, I would have had to re-xerox it.

85
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,441
But what they just cut off is that it says Paradiso, Canto 1.

86
00:08:52,441 --> 00:08:55,881
But you might want to write that on there so you know where you are.

87
00:08:55,881 --> 00:09:11,120
So at the top of this page, which begins, the glory of him who moves all things, that is Paradiso, Canto 1, and it's page 24 and 25 of the Shiarti, if you're ever looking it up.

88
00:09:11,441 --> 00:09:28,721
Okay, it starts right out with this very important idea that's going to sort of run throughout the Paradiso, that God is the totally satisfying object that everybody desires.

89
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,921
Yes, help yourself.

90
00:09:29,921 --> 00:09:31,041
This is what we're talking about.

91
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:31,760
You all got it.

92
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,641
This is the one we gave out before vacation.

93
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,480
You should have it in front of you.

94
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:44,961
If you don't have a copy, you should run up here and get one because we're going to be talking about reading things from within it.

95
00:09:46,561 --> 00:09:47,921
Okay, help yourselves.

96
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:48,881
There you go.

97
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,481
Now, here we are.

98
00:09:50,480 --> 00:10:11,361
And so to start with, the reason they are all being pulled upward from the top of the purgatory is because God, and this is just, you've got to keep this in mind all the time as you read this, God is the most satisfying thing in the universe.

99
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,401
He's the only totally satisfying being in the universe.

100
00:10:16,401 --> 00:10:24,961
He has created all of the creatures who need what he has.

101
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,921
Only and only a vision of him is totally fulfilling.

102
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:34,401
And every creature gets as much vision of him as it can take.

103
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:39,201
I mean, earthworms obviously don't get much, and lizards either, but animals do better.

104
00:10:39,201 --> 00:10:51,241
And we're capable, he created us capable of taking in the completely fulfilling and overwhelming radiance of the supreme being.

105
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:58,681
And so now, at the very beginning of the purgatory, of the paradiso, if I misspeak, correct me because I'll go back.

106
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:04,681
My mind on what I'm talking about, and I sometimes say the wrong sentence or the wrong book.

107
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:08,201
Anyway, here we are on page 24 of the Paradiso.

108
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:13,480
The glory of him who moves all things raised forth throughout the universe.

109
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,201
Uh-huh.

110
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:16,201
I wonder what it says.

111
00:11:16,521 --> 00:11:17,720
I've got to go look.

112
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,000
I mean, that's Chiardi, of course, not Dante.

113
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,481
And Beatrice isn't here today, so I didn't bring the Italian.

114
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,401
It didn't occur to me I was going to need it.

115
00:11:27,401 --> 00:11:30,841
Okay, so on the very first sentence, we have to find out.

116
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,880
I don't know what, I wonder what the Italian is.

117
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,921
I'll bring you word next time and see if I have to take back the universe.

118
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,840
Seems like they would, if it said creation, Chiari would have translated it creation.

119
00:11:42,921 --> 00:11:44,601
Okay, well, whatever.

120
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,760
I'm going to say creation until proved otherwise.

121
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:55,001
The glory of him who moves all things raised forth through all the creation and is reflected from each thing in proportion to its worth.

122
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:10,681
Now, I think that really means that each thing, what each thing is worth, is how much fulfillment it can get from contemplating God.

123
00:12:10,681 --> 00:12:12,120
Things are ranked that way.

124
00:12:12,121 --> 00:12:13,481
You'll see in a minute.

125
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:27,881
Each species, each kind of thing, like animals and reptiles and people and so forth, is ranked in how much fulfillment it can take or get.

126
00:12:28,201 --> 00:12:47,761
And even within people, and that's what the chart, again, that we've been looking at is, the back of the page that I just read from, you see that on each of these spheres, go back to the system of Dante's paradise, or the back there, there are various kinds of people.

127
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,481
They're not all equally capable of fulfillment.

128
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:59,121
They are, that's not quite the right word, way of saying it, but I'll say it that way for the moment.

129
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:11,281
And on each of the spheres, it isn't as if various species of people live, species is a funny word, various types of people.

130
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:12,960
There are types of people.

131
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:23,201
For instance, there are nuns, there are lovers, there are theologians, warriors, rulers, mystics, and so forth.

132
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:30,721
And each type of ruler is capable, as you go up this list, of more and more fulfillment.

133
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,321
Each type of ruler, did I say, sorry, each type of person, of human being.

134
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:46,720
And Chiardi, I think, has got it wrong already in that he's trying to figure out what's wrong with the people that are on the outer spheres.

135
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,601
How come they're not in the inner circle, so to speak?

136
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,241
And the answer is, I'm sure.

137
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,961
And remember, Dante doesn't write these explanations.

138
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,001
The Chiardi, or whoever the translator is, does.

139
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,641
What ranks these, we're asking, what ranks these people as nearer and near, well, I'm trying to say too many things at once.

140
00:14:08,641 --> 00:14:12,321
The people on the spheres aren't really on the spheres, I have to say that.

141
00:14:12,321 --> 00:14:23,000
They just come down to the spheres to meet Dante as he's going up, as he's so, as I say, rising like a rocket toward the supreme being.

142
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:29,080
He passes through all these crystalline spheres.

143
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:34,121
I'm sure he does that because he's now completely spiritual and disembodied.

144
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,080
And that's, I wonder where he got in discomfort.

145
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,080
He had a body in hell.

146
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:44,281
He went around kicking the head of somebody, and he got into the flames and it fell hot.

147
00:14:44,281 --> 00:14:46,201
He still had a body in purgatory.

148
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:51,481
It was heavy, and he couldn't climb except when the sun was shining.

149
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:58,121
He left his body behind, I guess, when he left, when he took off from the top of purgatory.

150
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,241
Okay, I'm going to find out.

151
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,681
I'll tell you next time.

152
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:04,281
That's sort of the question: when did Dante lose his body?

153
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:14,600
But anyway, he's obviously lost it because his body, because he goes right through these spheres, along with Beatrice, who we know lost her body when she died.

154
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,281
She tells him that.

155
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:30,840
So at each crystal sphere, which has one of these things embedded in it, it has the planet Mercury or it has the sun or it has Venus.

156
00:15:30,841 --> 00:15:35,560
And then it's when the sphere turns, the sun, we see the sun move.

157
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:49,001
And then this funny idea that you just have to get used to, they come down, these spirits who are there in this circle contemplating God in the Empyrean, they come down, which is the beatific rose is another name for it.

158
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,881
It's because it's got all these seats like an amphitheater, like petals, and so forth.

159
00:15:53,881 --> 00:16:05,201
They come down from the rose to the sphere that is somehow symbolic of the kind of human being they were.

160
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,401
And now we ask ourselves, and why, and why are people on the moon?

161
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,880
Well, and who's on the moon?

162
00:16:14,881 --> 00:16:17,040
Well, the nuns are on the moon.

163
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,681
And now Chihari comes in and says, well, what's really wrong with the people on the moon?

164
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:27,600
Why are they the furthest bleachers from where the beatific vision would be best?

165
00:16:27,601 --> 00:16:30,401
They've got the worst seats in the house.

166
00:16:30,401 --> 00:16:32,080
What did they do wrong?

167
00:16:32,081 --> 00:16:35,760
Well, Chihari thinks they are unconstant.

168
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,361
Well, they are unconstant, as you will know if you read it.

169
00:16:39,361 --> 00:16:42,240
Some of them, anyway, tell about that.

170
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,081
That they didn't keep their vows.

171
00:16:44,081 --> 00:16:48,561
But that can't be right, because some of the nuns are just plain nuns.

172
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,760
It doesn't say that they all didn't keep their vows.

173
00:16:52,081 --> 00:17:01,681
I'm pretty sure that what Dante thinks is that being a nun is just a pretty small way of being a human being.

174
00:17:01,681 --> 00:17:06,080
I mean, it's a way of sort of getting out of the world too easily.

175
00:17:06,081 --> 00:17:10,480
Let me go and show you where they say that she says that.

176
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,400
Now, have you got Canto 3?

177
00:17:12,401 --> 00:17:13,760
I believe you have.

178
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,441
I hard to remember.

179
00:17:15,841 --> 00:17:17,520
Do you have page 49?

180
00:17:17,841 --> 00:17:18,561
Maybe not.

181
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,400
Maybe that's the other one I just gave out.

182
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,441
Just a second.

183
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:23,201
There are too many things running.

184
00:17:23,201 --> 00:17:24,240
Well, I guess you just do.

185
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,681
I didn't give you 49.

186
00:17:25,681 --> 00:17:27,280
It's not that important.

187
00:17:27,601 --> 00:17:29,360
I just want to read you one thing.

188
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:36,320
One of the nuns on the moon says, as a girl, I'll tell you where it is in case it's important to you for some reason.

189
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,360
It's in Canto 3, line 101.

190
00:17:41,681 --> 00:17:57,000
She says, as a girl, I fled the world to walk the way she walked, to close myself in, was she somebody else she's talking about, and closed myself into her habit that is dress, pledged to her sisterhood till my last day.

191
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:06,520
The point is, nuns are minimally open to the wonders of the creation.

192
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,681
She flees the world.

193
00:18:08,681 --> 00:18:11,560
That's why they're the furthest away.

194
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:36,280
As you go up the list, well, I'm going to go up it later carefully, you have to think, I believe, that each kind of person that you see, which is that much closer to God and has that much more ability to take in total fulfilling radiance, each one as you go up is open to more of the creation.

195
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:42,201
And it's not because of bad things that you have to explain why they're out there.

196
00:18:42,201 --> 00:18:51,080
You have to explain why they're out there when they're further out because they were open to less of the creation than the people who are furthest in.

197
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:52,681
But I will get back to that.

198
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:57,720
In fact, I'm not supposed to be talking about that now, but it doesn't matter.

199
00:18:57,881 --> 00:18:59,161
But let's go back.

200
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:04,760
So God is totally fulfilling, and each creature reflects God to some extent.

201
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,520
That's what I'm talking about.

202
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:13,560
And they all are valuable, isn't quite the right word.

203
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,320
Merit is the word that shows up, and I've checked it in the Italian.

204
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,761
It's true, it says merit.

205
00:19:19,161 --> 00:19:27,800
Their merit depends on how much of the universe they're able to be open to and take in and appreciate something like that.

206
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,600
And they're ranked according to those merits.

207
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:47,921
What I just want to say an aside, it wouldn't be worth telling you all this, except that one day it sort of occurred to me that this is an interesting example of how a medieval like Dante thinks about how God created the book of nature.

208
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:50,960
Remember, I said everything in nature has a meaning.

209
00:19:50,960 --> 00:20:00,320
It isn't just that there are trees and elephants and crocodiles and so forth, but all that can be interpreted religiously and morally.

210
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,880
Well, look what he's doing to the planets.

211
00:20:02,881 --> 00:20:19,760
I mean, he's telling you that I presume it's true, I'm assuming, and it must be so, that they know that how the planets are ranked as further and further and further away from us.

212
00:20:20,081 --> 00:20:23,040
And where are we on this chart?

213
00:20:23,361 --> 00:20:26,240
Hmm, everything seems pleasant to me.

214
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,361
Well, we're in the center.

215
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:29,760
We're below the moon, that's sure.

216
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:46,240
There is the, we are, we are, remember, try to picture this the way it looks to an ordinary person who hasn't done any, hasn't learned any astronomy of the Galileo and Copernican sort, who doesn't know that we're going around the sun.

217
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,080
The Earth is the center.

218
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:52,880
And these are further and further from the center.

219
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:57,600
And that means nearer and nearer the Empire.

220
00:20:57,601 --> 00:21:05,280
Nearer and nearer, they're further and further from the material center and nearer and nearer the spiritual center.

221
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,120
Now, having said all that, I'm not sure it was worth the struggle.

222
00:21:09,121 --> 00:21:33,640
It turns out that the distance of these spheres from the spiritual center is, and they get nearer and nearer as you go up in this spiritual way, corresponds to their merit, which corresponds to how much of the creation they can appreciate and enjoy.

223
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,441
And so Dante, this is now the move about the creation.

224
00:21:38,441 --> 00:22:01,401
Dante has to think that corresponding to each of these spheres, there is a certain interpretation of the meaning of that sphere, and that corresponds to a certain amount of openness.

225
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,921
I'm just doing this wrong, but I'm going to go.

226
00:22:04,921 --> 00:22:06,361
I have to go ahead now.

227
00:22:06,361 --> 00:22:09,401
I got myself into something that I have to go finish.

228
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:15,880
As long as I've said all that, I've got to rush through and tell you, because otherwise this seems completely mysterious.

229
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:18,841
So I've already done number one in a way.

230
00:22:19,161 --> 00:22:35,561
The nuns are the least open to the marvels and able to love and be loved less by the Creator than anybody else.

231
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,720
That's not quite the right way to put it.

232
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:49,080
Able to, their desires are smaller, and therefore their satisfaction is less.

233
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:58,280
Therefore, they don't need to be near, and it would make no sense for them to be near God in the rose.

234
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:09,600
They're farther away, but, and this is what I'm going to read you in a moment, they don't mind because they are completely fulfilled.

235
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:19,760
It's just that the amount of fullness to fill, or how what it would be to fulfill them, is less than what it would be to fulfill.

236
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,720
Let's take the extreme opposite, the mystics at number seven.

237
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:36,720
Dante thinks of the mystics as, as I'll read you the quote, contemplating all the universe in all of its detail and seeing how it's all bound together.

238
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,320
That's certainly not what any of the people beneath them can do.

239
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:51,201
So, but let me show you that you get this funny result, which Dante is very happy with, that everyone is happy, so to speak, where they are.

240
00:23:51,201 --> 00:23:52,641
So, let's go through that.

241
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,161
I jumped ahead, but that's all right.

242
00:23:54,161 --> 00:23:55,361
We'll come back to Dante.

243
00:23:55,361 --> 00:24:07,521
We're putting aside for a minute Dante and Beatrice flying through space, making the trip from the top of purgatory through all the spheres to God.

244
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:11,280
Let them be flying there while we talk about this for a minute.

245
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:24,000
So, the people come down from the rose, and it impressed Dante that the order of the planets reflects the order of amount of fulfillment that they're capable of.

246
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,600
Now, you have to assume, I see somebody looking worried.

247
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:33,840
You know, Venus is somehow associated with love.

248
00:24:33,841 --> 00:24:38,080
And I don't know how where that comes from, but Dante buys it.

249
00:24:38,081 --> 00:24:40,241
Mars is associated with warriors.

250
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,480
It's just like it is still.

251
00:24:43,121 --> 00:24:58,120
And what is amazing, but only natural since God created the universe, is that the ranking of all these various forms of human life, the hierarchical ranking, corresponds to the way the planets just are in the universe.

252
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:18,360
You see how, so that writes the sort of understanding of the order of the planets into this understanding of that, not just that they happen to be yanked out of the original solar mess in that order, like we think, and it doesn't mean anything.

253
00:25:18,361 --> 00:25:23,880
And moreover, the names on them are just caught on their ass, and it doesn't mean anything either, we would say.

254
00:25:23,881 --> 00:25:40,921
That the names of these planets tell you what kind of person is associated with those planets, and the order of the planets ought to correspond, and Dante thinks it does, I believe, to the amount of creation that this person is open to appreciate.

255
00:25:40,921 --> 00:25:42,441
Now let's go through it.

256
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:53,800
So we've already seen that the nuns are sort of timid and flee the toughness of the earth.

257
00:25:54,280 --> 00:26:00,120
They aren't able to take on all that much fulfillment.

258
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:12,120
And even though, this is the funny part, they are total, all fold in heaven, are totally fulfilled.

259
00:26:12,441 --> 00:26:13,960
Even the nuns.

260
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,161
So how can that be?

261
00:26:15,161 --> 00:26:21,960
I mean, here are these mystics taking in the whole c of creation and all of its order and all of its unity.

262
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,360
And here are these nuns fleeing even this world into the nunnery.

263
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:29,240
And yet they're all totally fulfilled.

264
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,121
Well, it's sort of like from a hell of a from Alice in Wonderland.

265
00:26:33,121 --> 00:26:36,000
How many of you remember the walrus and the carpenter?

266
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:49,760
They both, when they went out and ate oysters, the the Alice worries about the fact that I the walrus ate more oysters, but but it turns out the carpenter ate fewer oysters, but he ate all the oysters he could.

267
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,681
And then Alice doesn't know which one to condemn worse.

268
00:26:53,681 --> 00:26:59,280
The more, the walrus who ate more oysters or the carpenter who ate all the oysters they could.

269
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:04,480
Well, it's the the the nuns have taken in all the fulfillment they can.

270
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,480
So that and that's the important thing.

271
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,240
They are totally fulfilled, but they are like small containers.

272
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,921
And Gante talks about that on 48.

273
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,320
And now I think you do have that, don't you?

274
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,881
The next batch of things I gave you.

275
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:25,840
That's one of the reasons I, or I'm beginning to have a sinking feeling that maybe they didn't copy all I wanted them to copy.

276
00:27:26,081 --> 00:27:29,441
The second thing we hung out, we handed out today.

277
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,040
Uh-huh, there's, oh, no wonder it's so small.

278
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,760
And no wonder it's got nothing on the back.

279
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,760
Well, I'll read it to you, that's all.

280
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,561
We're looking in Canto 3.

281
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,760
You don't have Canto 3?

282
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:45,201
I think you do.

283
00:27:45,201 --> 00:27:49,040
I think I just have too many pieces of paper in front of me.

284
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,201
So it should be.

285
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,840
Has anybody found any evidence that you might have page 48?

286
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,000
I did hand out 48?

287
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,441
No, page 48.

288
00:27:59,441 --> 00:28:00,401
I didn't.

289
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:03,520
Well, yeah, I thought we had Canto 3.

290
00:28:03,921 --> 00:28:04,960
Where is Canto 3?

291
00:28:05,201 --> 00:28:06,321
What I hand it out?

292
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:06,880
Yeah.

293
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,401
There, okay.

294
00:28:08,641 --> 00:28:09,121
Good.

295
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:10,401
That's what I want.

296
00:28:10,401 --> 00:28:10,880
That's right.

297
00:28:10,881 --> 00:28:12,800
It wouldn't be page 48, as I said, right.

298
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,041
Right, now I got it because I had to use a different translation.

299
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,921
So here we go.

300
00:28:15,921 --> 00:28:20,120
Now, I want you to look, one, at Canto 3, line 103.

301
00:28:21,081 --> 00:28:25,560
And that's what I read already, but now that we've got ourselves organized, we can look at it.

302
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:29,561
Line 103 says that I fled the world.

303
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,561
I don't know how it says, I fled as a young girl to follow her and so forth.

304
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,520
Oh, it's fun.

305
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,960
There's no fled the world there.

306
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,320
I like better fled the world.

307
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,921
But it comes to the same thing.

308
00:28:38,921 --> 00:28:45,881
But now I want to talk about how they're all equally fulfilled, which is a very interesting sort of Dante thing.

309
00:28:46,201 --> 00:28:48,120
Starting line 70.

310
00:28:48,121 --> 00:28:50,600
Boy, this is the hardest to cope with.

311
00:28:51,161 --> 00:28:53,161
Got 69.

312
00:28:54,121 --> 00:29:01,000
But when Canto 3, trying to find line 70, I don't see line 7.

313
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,560
Tell me where line 70 is.

314
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:06,121
406, I see 72.

315
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:09,480
Ah, yeah, but 72 is the first number I see, but you're right.

316
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:18,441
So top of 406, you've got, brother, the virtue of our heavenly love tempers our will and makes us want no more than what we have.

317
00:29:18,441 --> 00:29:21,000
We thirst for this alone.

318
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,240
If we desire to be higher up, then our desires would not be in accord with his will who assigns us to this sphere.

319
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:32,840
Think carefully what love is, and you'll see such discord has no place and so forth and so forth.

320
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:52,520
What this says is, they are, by the way God set up the creation, happy with the amount of divine presence they've got because they're capable of less total openness and less total love.

321
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:59,001
See, Dante's asking, you have to go back to the previous page, 405, to see what he's answering.

322
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,800
They're answering.

323
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,841
I mean, he's saying, but tell me, this is line 64.

324
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,360
All you souls so happy here, do you learn for a higher post in heaven to see more, to become more loved by him?

325
00:30:11,681 --> 00:30:12,560
And she smiled.

326
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,840
I mean, they all said that they were full of happiness.

327
00:30:15,841 --> 00:30:23,441
And then they explain that they're completely happy because they've got, in effect, all the love they can take.

328
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:36,401
Well, Dante says also in 64, please tell, line 64, please, but tell me, please, do you who are happy here have any wish to rise to a higher station and make yourself more dear?

329
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,840
And she says, no.

330
00:30:40,161 --> 00:30:42,080
What we desire, we have.

331
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,000
I'm looking at 70.

332
00:30:46,081 --> 00:30:47,681
70s is so different.

333
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:49,681
I like it in Chiardi for this.

334
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,640
I'll read it over in the other version.

335
00:30:52,641 --> 00:30:56,401
Brother, the power of love, which is our bliss, calms our will.

336
00:30:56,401 --> 00:30:58,560
What we desire, we have.

337
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,121
There is in us no other thirst than this.

338
00:31:01,121 --> 00:31:02,880
How does it go over here?

339
00:31:02,881 --> 00:31:05,280
That's how I'm reading 72.

340
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,881
Make us want no more than what we have.

341
00:31:08,881 --> 00:31:10,321
We thirst for this alone.

342
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,441
Okay, that's all right.

343
00:31:11,441 --> 00:31:24,560
So now, but now you can run through, once you see how it goes, and see how Dante thinks that the souls are ranked by how much fulfillment they can take.

344
00:31:24,881 --> 00:31:34,881
That we're still looking at the nuns, so now on Canto 4, which I don't think you have, which I'm going to read you one thing from.

345
00:31:34,881 --> 00:31:42,161
Okay, um in Canto 4, line 34, which you don't have, you hear more about this.

346
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,201
All add their beauty to the highest wheel.

347
00:31:45,201 --> 00:31:55,880
That's the divine source of all movement, and share the sweet life and vary it only by how much of the eternal breath they feel.

348
00:31:56,201 --> 00:32:05,000
They showed themselves here, they show themselves here not because this post has been assigned to them, but to symbolize that they stand lowest in the heavenly host.

349
00:32:06,361 --> 00:32:08,921
He's explaining why they show up on the moon.

350
00:32:08,921 --> 00:32:10,120
Okay, that's enough.

351
00:32:10,121 --> 00:32:14,681
The point is to see that, and we'll only see it if we go through some more.

352
00:32:14,681 --> 00:32:15,720
Ah, good, a question.

353
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,320
Wow, wow, I don't know.

354
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,681
That's a very good question.

355
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,321
I know what Dante says about it.

356
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,041
I was going to come to it later.

357
00:32:31,081 --> 00:32:36,921
Remind me to come back to that when I talk about what Mark Lombardo says about free will.

358
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,520
Because you're asking an interesting question that Dante's thought about.

359
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:52,760
So when each being, each human being is created, are they already created only with the ability to love a certain amount and therefore turn into a nun from the start?

360
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,240
And I think the answer is supposed to be no.

361
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,920
But I'll wait.

362
00:32:59,001 --> 00:33:00,040
So now what?

363
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:01,801
So everything is ordered here.

364
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,801
Everything is harmonious.

365
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:09,961
All these spheres, each one of them has its own, has people on it that have their own job.

366
00:33:10,601 --> 00:33:22,760
Love and politics and war and so forth don't conflict the way, say, for Agamemnon, love of Ephigenia, and having to be king, going to war, conflict.

367
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:31,960
Dante has set up the universe, or Dante tells us how the Creator has set up the universe, so that everything is harmonious.

368
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,641
I think the word harmonious appears in something we just read, doesn't it?

369
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:38,720
Or did I imagine it?

370
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,121
Discourse can have no place among these circles.

371
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,641
Discord can have no place among these circles.

372
00:33:44,641 --> 00:33:55,921
And that's the idea that God, who's after all unified, creates a creation that is unified.

373
00:33:56,481 --> 00:33:58,321
Now let's see where we are.

374
00:33:59,681 --> 00:34:02,321
Oh, it's just here's the harmony thing.

375
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:07,760
But it's again, it's not in what you've got, but it's not worth your having a whole page for.

376
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:22,321
In Canto 8, line 100, not only does the perfect mind, that's God, provide for the diversities of every nature, but for their good and harmony besides.

377
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:31,601
That just means naturally, of course, that you're going to have a harmonious world that is made by a good, created by a good God.

378
00:34:32,561 --> 00:34:34,081
Now let's see.

379
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:40,161
Now I'm going to run quickly, just making up what I think Dante thinks about these others.

380
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:47,520
So the nuns withdraw from the world, they don't desire much, but they get all that they can desire.

381
00:34:48,161 --> 00:34:58,641
And then there are other ones who have much more desires and get much closer.

382
00:34:58,641 --> 00:35:01,921
And that's where we're on to Venus.

383
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,480
I don't understand Mercury.

384
00:35:04,641 --> 00:35:06,880
I didn't want to go back and worry about it.

385
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,881
Let's jump to Venus.

386
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:19,641
But whatever Mercury is, somebody who does want to worry about it could figure out, and maybe I will if I get time, why it doesn't have anything to do with marred by ambition.

387
00:35:19,641 --> 00:35:30,441
I think these people, just whoever they are, just don't have much ambition, just like the nuns don't have much, don't have much, make many demands on God and the creation.

388
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,560
But the lovers, they're higher up.

389
00:35:33,561 --> 00:35:39,081
One of the interesting things about the lovers is they're not at the top or high up toward the top.

390
00:35:39,081 --> 00:35:55,321
I think that's because though Dante always likes lovers and he likes the lovers that he meets as he goes up, they are, after all, only able to love maybe one or a few more people.

391
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:08,760
What's interesting, I just want to mention it, the lovers he meets in this are particularly lovers who got either very intense love or very or lots of lovers.

392
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:15,641
And that fits, I mean, it's love making you as open as possible to some of the goods of the creation.

393
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:25,960
So there's one line about Dido in here in Canto 8, which says, that's not the Dido line I want.

394
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,240
Ah, here it is.

395
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,401
Okay, I'm in Canto 9 now.

396
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:43,881
And there's a person named Falket who says, Dido did not burn hotter with love's rage when she offended both Sicius and Crusea than I before my locks grew thin with age.

397
00:36:43,880 --> 00:37:00,441
That's a, in other words, a love as intense as Dido's, which for Virgil, I just bring this out, is so destructive and is a kind of quantity that gets you nearer to God when you're capable of that kind of love.

398
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:12,320
And to Chiardi's kind of embarrassment and annoyance, the other soul he talks to is famous, promiscuous lady, Kuniza.

399
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,960
I don't know.

400
00:37:12,961 --> 00:37:21,840
She says, I shine here because this star conquered me with its flame, yet gladly I embrace the fate, and so forth.

401
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,160
That's the one she's with now.

402
00:37:24,481 --> 00:37:28,720
But it turns out in the footnote, that where was it?

403
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:37,521
She's had three husbands, and she's a very outgoing person and has lots of lovers and so forth.

404
00:37:37,521 --> 00:38:01,201
Then she's the one Dante picks out to talk to because I think being open to being intensely, sensually and totally in love with one person or even many gets you higher up in the rankings.

405
00:38:03,601 --> 00:38:10,561
The footnote says, her amorous nature was like the force of fate that shaped her lot.

406
00:38:10,561 --> 00:38:11,681
I guess that's all right.

407
00:38:11,681 --> 00:38:18,161
I don't know about the force of fate, how she got that way, but she is open to everybody.

408
00:38:18,161 --> 00:38:20,161
I doubt if any of you have ever read a book.

409
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,560
I'm fishing just to wonder.

410
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,921
Anybody read Graham Green books?

411
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:28,481
Grad The End of the Affair?

412
00:38:28,481 --> 00:38:37,440
It's about this woman who has this sort of torrid affair with God and keeps track of it in her diary, and her lover finds the diaries and is jealous.

413
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:45,521
It's sort of very, Graham Greene is a Catholic, and it's very tuned into this canto, I think.

414
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:46,641
So let's see then.

415
00:38:46,641 --> 00:39:04,041
So then there's the lovers, and after that, the theologians, which are the people who think about God, which is certainly a bigger subject to be concerned with than one other person or even lots of lovers.

416
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:18,281
And the church warriors, then, I take it that as crusaders, which is what they must be, they also have a big, you know, they're very involved in the world, very active, cover a lot of ground.

417
00:39:18,601 --> 00:39:21,561
And then there are the Jupiter, the just rulers.

418
00:39:21,561 --> 00:39:31,481
They must have even vaster desires, be more active and more powerful, and therefore more demanding of creation and more satisfied.

419
00:39:31,481 --> 00:39:33,240
And finally, the contemplatives.

420
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,641
And you might think, well, why the contemplatives?

421
00:39:35,641 --> 00:39:43,001
They seem to be the least active and the least sort of taking over the creation the way the warriors were.

422
00:39:43,001 --> 00:39:48,600
Well, then you get this explanation on 336, which is, I'll have to see if you have it.

423
00:39:48,601 --> 00:39:51,881
I don't remember.

424
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,961
Well, you probably do.

425
00:39:53,961 --> 00:39:55,161
Well, but it isn't.

426
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,081
Oh, 363, you certainly have.

427
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:02,521
So look on yours, 363, which is Canto 33.

428
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,040
I think you have it.

429
00:40:04,041 --> 00:40:05,961
Do you have Canto 33?

430
00:40:05,961 --> 00:40:07,000
You may not.

431
00:40:07,641 --> 00:40:08,441
You do.

432
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:14,041
Okay, then you're 85, line 85.

433
00:40:14,681 --> 00:40:18,521
Now, this is what the mystic sees.

434
00:40:18,521 --> 00:40:22,121
I saw within its depth, that is God.

435
00:40:22,121 --> 00:40:27,081
Well, this is Dante, but he's seeing the kind of thing the mystic sees at this point.

436
00:40:27,081 --> 00:40:31,960
He says, I fixed my eyes on the eternal light until my vision was consumed in it.

437
00:40:32,161 --> 00:40:40,720
I saw within its depths depths, which conceives all things in a single volume bound by love, of which the universe is the scattered leaves.

438
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,121
The universe again, interesting.

439
00:40:43,681 --> 00:40:54,561
And so the mystics see the world from God's point of view, for instance, which is the most satisfying of anything.

440
00:40:55,681 --> 00:41:01,040
And that is to see the world as one unified book.

441
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,040
If it says universe, I can see now why it might.

442
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,601
I mean, the creation is a universe.

443
00:41:09,601 --> 00:41:10,240
I don't know.

444
00:41:10,481 --> 00:41:12,480
I'm going to find out whether they use the term.

445
00:41:12,481 --> 00:41:18,720
But the creation is totally unified, bound like the leaves into one book.

446
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:25,680
But that's only natural, because the understanding of being is createdness, and one supreme being created it.

447
00:41:25,681 --> 00:41:32,240
It's not going to have contradictions and a multiplicity of gods and forces in it.

448
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:38,561
Now, having done that, which I was going to do, but not in the order I did it, doesn't matter.

449
00:41:38,561 --> 00:41:41,681
I'm going back to where I was going to be.

450
00:41:42,161 --> 00:41:44,640
But let's have any comments, because that's all I have to say.

451
00:41:44,641 --> 00:41:49,841
I was just trying to give you an overall story about the layout of paradise.

452
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:54,081
And that's not the main thing that interests us.

453
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:55,840
So I'm finished with it.

454
00:41:56,161 --> 00:41:58,000
Unless anybody has anything to say about it.

455
00:41:58,001 --> 00:42:01,600
It's just since you don't have the book and we don't have time to read much, I have to fill it in.

456
00:42:01,601 --> 00:42:02,161
Yeah.

457
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:03,121
Yeah.

458
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,080
What is verse?

459
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:09,921
Yeah, I know uni is one, but what do you think verse is?

460
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,601
I don't know either.

461
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,400
Words first, uni.

462
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,320
Ah, well, that's neat.

463
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,880
I don't know if it's true, but you want to make it sort of God's word.

464
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:23,481
In the beginning was the word, and that was the universe.

465
00:42:24,121 --> 00:42:25,000
Nido.

466
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:25,801
I don't know.

467
00:42:26,121 --> 00:42:27,561
We have to look it up.

468
00:42:27,561 --> 00:42:29,560
Now we've got all kinds of interesting questions.

469
00:42:29,561 --> 00:42:34,121
I doubt it, but it sounds like a good, I wish it were.

470
00:42:34,121 --> 00:42:45,561
Okay, I'm going to go to, having done now the layout of Paradise, I want to go through more details about Dante and Beatrice.

471
00:42:45,561 --> 00:42:51,321
So I've just argued that everything moves to its proper place by love.

472
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:57,641
That is, it gets the amount of fulfillment that it is capable of having.

473
00:42:57,641 --> 00:43:06,280
And they, because they're capable of lots of love, they're taking off from the top of purgatory.

474
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:13,401
Now we go back to the page where we started, page 24, the one that doesn't have any number on it.

475
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:24,040
Then I want to go and go on from there to page 27, which I believe you must have too.

476
00:43:24,041 --> 00:43:25,801
Yes, page 27.

477
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,481
We're in Canto 1.

478
00:43:27,481 --> 00:43:31,081
We're in line this.

479
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,881
Well, here we are.

480
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,360
But you just get some description of it.

481
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:40,840
At the top, on line 91, you think you are still on Earth.

482
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,680
This is Beatrice talking to Dante.

483
00:43:42,681 --> 00:43:50,841
The lightning fear never fled downward from its natural place as rapidly as you are rising here.

484
00:43:51,481 --> 00:44:03,361
And that's, and then skipping down to 103, of all things she began, whatever their mode, observed an inner, they observe an inner order in this form that makes the universe resemble God.

485
00:44:01,561 --> 00:44:05,681
Boy, am I making a fool of myself over universe?

486
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:07,360
It's all over the place.

487
00:44:07,681 --> 00:44:10,801
I wonder how I ever had this ingenious idea to get rid of it.

488
00:44:12,081 --> 00:44:17,681
I'm getting more and more convinced that the universe for Dante, but it was already a universe for Dante.

489
00:44:17,681 --> 00:44:19,681
It just wasn't our kind of universe.

490
00:44:19,681 --> 00:44:27,441
I mean, his kind of universe was created, so it's also called the creation, and is full of this human meaning.

491
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:35,841
Our universe just blew up one day, as far as we now think and know, which is subject to revision anyway.

492
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:50,000
But it doesn't seem to have written in it something so that you could read off from the order of the planets, the order of fulfillment of people whose personality corresponds to the personality associated with the planets.

493
00:44:50,001 --> 00:44:52,561
I mean, that's a different kind of universe.

494
00:44:52,641 --> 00:44:56,321
And I wish he would just call it a creation, but maybe not.

495
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,441
Anyway, so the universe resembles God.

496
00:45:00,081 --> 00:45:09,440
And now, skipping down to 109, all being within this order, by the laws of its own nature, is impelled to find its proper station around its primal cause.

497
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:17,601
This is more and more, you get to where the intensity of God's love equals just how much love you need.

498
00:45:17,601 --> 00:45:25,281
Thus, every nature moves across the tide of the great sea of being to its own port, each with its given instinct as its guide.

499
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:30,961
Now, that seems to cast some light on the question whether it gets born that way.

500
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,321
It may be that I'm not sure.

501
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:42,801
It now looks like each thing is, each, maybe each type of thing gets a certain amount of fulfillment.

502
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:49,161
I don't know yet whether nuns have got the instinct, doubt it, but I'm not sure.

503
00:45:49,161 --> 00:45:51,800
This instinct draws the fire about the moon.

504
00:45:47,041 --> 00:45:53,641
It is the mover in the mortal heart.

505
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,760
It draws the earth together and makes it one.

506
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:01,401
All of this, the love is holding everything together.

507
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,641
And all creatures have this instinct for love.

508
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:16,441
Not only the brute creatures are now in 118, but all those possess of intellect and love, this instinct drives their mark as a bow shoots forth its arrows.

509
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,161
I'm trying to figure out.

510
00:46:21,161 --> 00:46:22,201
We'll see more in a minute.

511
00:46:22,201 --> 00:46:24,040
I just don't want to be mysterious.

512
00:46:24,601 --> 00:46:37,960
We'll see that Mark Lombardo tells Dante that every creature, and babies, for instance, are born with this total love, that is, that they're able to throw themselves into loving everything.

513
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:51,961
And I thought that meant that maybe with intensity, but I now think it probably means just with diversity, that the intensity of your love might be settled by your DNA or your instinct.

514
00:46:51,961 --> 00:47:00,760
And then it's up to you what you, how much intensity you can take, but then it's up to you to direct it.

515
00:47:01,561 --> 00:47:02,681
We'll get back to that.

516
00:47:02,681 --> 00:47:05,401
I want to go, I'm still in Canto 1.

517
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,961
And then I'm now in line 124.

518
00:47:07,961 --> 00:47:10,920
And to it now is a place foretold.

519
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,441
Are we two soaring?

520
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:17,641
This is Beatrice and Dante, driven by the bow, whose every arrow finds a mark of gold.

521
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:25,401
But now comes where free will comes in, which we're going to have to hear more about, on line 130.

522
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:34,400
Well, starting with 127, it's true that oftentimes the form of a thing does not respond to the intent of the art, the matter being deaf to summoning.

523
00:47:31,961 --> 00:47:36,400
Wow, I could use another translation.

524
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,480
But I know what Dante's saying.

525
00:47:40,481 --> 00:47:42,720
I just wonder if it's that obscure.

526
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:50,321
Aristotle says that the matter of which things are made doesn't always take on the form very well.

527
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:55,521
So people manage, trees don't all grow to be beautiful, perfect live oaks.

528
00:47:55,521 --> 00:48:02,240
Some of them, the matter out of which the tree is made just doesn't take on the perfect form of a live oak.

529
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:08,400
And that's the sense in which, and now, but that's only half the story.

530
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,961
And people have something more.

531
00:48:10,961 --> 00:48:16,561
They have free will to not develop in the way that they should.

532
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:18,320
Well, we know that, don't we?

533
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:36,321
Because in the city of this, the homosexuals have substituted, by way of their free will and autonomy, a different goal than their natural instinct, which is heterosexual, according to Dante.

534
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:46,321
And so everybody is capable of not following out their instincts.

535
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,400
But notice what that does with free will.

536
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,561
That makes it a negative sort of thing.

537
00:48:50,561 --> 00:49:02,081
The only thing you can do with free will is turn aside from the goal that God has built into you with your instincts.

538
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,560
And we'll hear more about that in a minute.

539
00:49:05,041 --> 00:49:12,240
There are lots of different views of free will going around here, and I'm going to collect them all together before maybe before the end of today.

540
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,440
I'm not sure yet.

541
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,281
So here we are.

542
00:49:16,481 --> 00:49:28,841
All the material side of them is gone, and that's why they can now fly up as they do toward God with their instinct, their love, pulling them toward God.

543
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:34,840
And that's just what you would expect.

544
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:38,361
Free will, I'm just reading what I've written here, can deflect things.

545
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:44,681
And in Virgil, let me give you a sort of quick run-through what's happening with free will.

546
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:48,360
By the way, I can't tell when I read about Dante on free will.

547
00:49:48,601 --> 00:49:51,801
You can think about it if it happens to be what you want to think about.

548
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:55,321
Either he's very smart or he's very confused.

549
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:59,240
I mean, on any points, this puzzles me.

550
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:09,641
I mean, but I'm always ready to give him credit for being very smart and only as confused as you have to be if you try to make sort of Greek sense of Christianity.

551
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,800
But they're deep troubles.

552
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:24,521
But on this subject of free will, I think he thinks that there are various ways of thinking about it, but they're all wrong, except for the one that finally wins out at the end of the discussion.

553
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:52,521
But the first thing is, remember Virgil said way back on Inferno 112, this important thing about free will, which I talked about right before vacation, I think, or at least not enough, but where he says, this is Canto, now I'm in the Inferno, Canto 12, line 45.

554
00:50:53,001 --> 00:50:54,680
No, that's not quite it yet.

555
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:59,801
I've written the wrong thing, but it's right in this vicinity, so I will have to find it.

556
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:08,161
Well, hmm, you remember that you, that according to Virgil, you have the free will to contain your love.

557
00:51:08,481 --> 00:51:18,240
So the picture is that you start out like a child loving everything with all your might.

558
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:39,201
And when you, thanks to your parents and the church and the state, you finally get it so that you restrain your love so that and that's I'm amazed I don't have it because I spent a lot of trouble looking for that quote and then I thought I wrote it down.

559
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,441
Anybody know where that is?

560
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,760
Maybe it's the one, is it in the purgatory?

561
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:45,280
Okay, where in the purgatory?

562
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,600
Maybe I'm, aha, that's probably what happened.

563
00:51:47,601 --> 00:51:50,401
I wrote the wrong page number.

564
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,001
Let's go look.

565
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:52,960
Who's talking?

566
00:51:52,961 --> 00:51:54,240
Now, Virgil?

567
00:51:55,121 --> 00:51:56,481
Tell me where now?

568
00:51:56,481 --> 00:51:58,161
Give me a page number.

569
00:51:58,481 --> 00:52:10,561
He says, and that's why I was looking for it: free will is this business to constrain yourself to hold in and Beatrice will tell you more about it.

570
00:52:11,201 --> 00:52:12,720
But where does he say that?

571
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,121
I had it in mind.

572
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,240
Hmm.

573
00:52:16,561 --> 00:52:17,280
Aha.

574
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,840
I just, it just, here it is, 190.

575
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:23,521
I don't have any place where I say 190, but that's where it is.

576
00:52:23,521 --> 00:52:25,040
How peculiar.

577
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,240
Okay.

578
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,000
Well, anyway, here it is, and important.

579
00:52:30,001 --> 00:52:33,041
We're in, it's in the purgatory.

580
00:52:33,041 --> 00:52:40,161
It's in Canto 28, 18, right?

581
00:52:40,161 --> 00:52:40,641
And we have it.

582
00:52:40,641 --> 00:52:41,840
Do we have it in our handout?

583
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,001
I hope, but I doubt it.

584
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:47,001
Oh, we have, where are we in?

585
00:52:46,641 --> 00:52:48,681
Ah, we have the book, right?

586
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,600
So for that, we're all set.

587
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:52,201
But you don't have it with you, probably.

588
00:52:52,201 --> 00:52:55,640
So I'm going to read it to you just for a moment.

589
00:52:56,121 --> 00:53:07,001
So he says: let us say all the love, we're in now Canto 18, line 70.

590
00:53:07,001 --> 00:53:13,961
All the love that burns in you springs from necessity, but you still have the power to check its sway.

591
00:53:13,961 --> 00:53:17,961
These noble powers Beatrice will comprehend as free will.

592
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:22,121
Keep that term in mind if you should speak of it when you ascend.

593
00:53:22,121 --> 00:53:26,521
Now, the interesting thing is, Beatrice never says anything like that.

594
00:53:26,521 --> 00:53:32,121
And either Dante is, as I say, just stupid and dropping the ball, or I think clever.

595
00:53:32,121 --> 00:53:45,401
Remember, Virgil has to think that you can't get total satisfaction out of anything in the universe, and least of all loving other people, as we saw with Dido, but anything.

596
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:57,401
And therefore, as a Stoic, he says that you have to cut back your love and desire so that you don't ask more from things than they're actually able to give you.

597
00:53:57,481 --> 00:53:58,760
Just said a certain thing.

598
00:53:58,760 --> 00:53:59,641
No, it's okay.

599
00:53:59,961 --> 00:54:21,481
And that's what you have to believe in a universe in which there isn't any God in the middle of a beatific rose that has created the whole universe specifically to satisfy and created people so that they've got exactly the sort of desires that that supreme being can exactly satisfy.

600
00:54:21,481 --> 00:54:33,201
If that's the case, the last thing you would be wanting to do is hold in your desire, which is this business of check the love that burns in you.

601
00:54:31,961 --> 00:54:37,841
And when you get to Beatrice, she doesn't say that.

602
00:54:38,161 --> 00:54:51,281
She says that free will is what makes people turn aside, which is this, what I was just talking about, that is they get deflected from where they're supposed to go.

603
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:56,000
I want to write down just a second because I don't want to get it wrong all the time.

604
00:54:57,201 --> 00:55:00,081
We're in the purgatory.

605
00:55:00,481 --> 00:55:02,240
That's a very important passage.

606
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,240
You've got to remember that always.

607
00:55:04,561 --> 00:55:08,481
That's where Virgil goes completely wrong.

608
00:55:08,481 --> 00:55:12,080
And I said this once before, but I'll just repeat it.

609
00:55:12,081 --> 00:55:17,921
There seems to be lots of evidence that Virgil goes wrong, except that none of the critics seem to notice it.

610
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,081
And I could be mad at making it up.

611
00:55:20,081 --> 00:55:40,401
But just as soon as Virgil says that free will is that which you can be constrained, which constrains, checks your enthusiasm and your love and your desire, and tells Dante that Beatrice is going to say more about it, which I'm sure she doesn't, all kinds of weird things happen.

612
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:48,481
The moon comes out, looking as bright as a bucket, and thins the lesser stars that seem to drown.

613
00:55:48,481 --> 00:56:01,041
Well, maybe I'm reading too much into it, but I think the moon is this kind of pale copy of the sun, and in Virgil and antiquity has got a kind of pale copy of what's really going on.

614
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:02,960
They've got something that's correct.

615
00:56:02,961 --> 00:56:08,081
That is, you can use your will to rein in your desires.

616
00:56:08,081 --> 00:56:09,441
But it's not true.

617
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:18,440
It's given our kind of universe, you shouldn't use your free will to rein in your desires, and then maybe thins the lesser stars.

618
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,121
Remember the three stars?

619
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:23,960
They're the stars for faith, hope, and charity.

620
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:33,801
So the Virgil kind of explanation with its kind of reflected light would dim the faith, hope, and charity stars.

621
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,440
Virgil doesn't believe in faith, hope, and charity.

622
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:41,481
Virgil believes in temperance, wisdom, courage, and justice.

623
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:44,760
Those are the four stars of antiquity.

624
00:56:44,760 --> 00:57:09,401
So there's all that evidence, and then the most important evidence, I think, right after that is that they're on the circle of the slothful, and as Virgil says, you know, rein in your will, guard the threshold of consent, at that very moment, a mob of people comes rushing at them, and they're all yelling, faster, faster, to be slow in love is to lose time.

625
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:15,320
That would seem to be a comment on Virgil saying, you know, reign in your love, control yourselves.

626
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:21,881
There's nothing really to get excited about, nothing satisfying, nothing worth living for, and so forth.

627
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:27,081
So, anyway, so now back to what is the story on free will then?

628
00:57:27,081 --> 00:57:37,481
Well, it looks like in the purgatory on 173, you get a discussion of free will.

629
00:57:37,481 --> 00:57:40,120
I mean, it doesn't say anything like that.

630
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:52,521
It says at the top of 173, we're in Canto 6 line 70.

631
00:57:53,161 --> 00:58:11,361
All free, if the star, if the heavens determine what people do, starting at line 68, if the heavens, this heavens are not God, this astrology, Mark Lombardo was ranting against astrology.

632
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,601
Dante doesn't believe in astrology.

633
00:58:13,601 --> 00:58:28,480
And says, if the heavens were the source of all things good and evil, then things would be in man sees in the heaven the source of good and evil, but if that were true, then all free will would be destroyed and there would be no justice and so forth.

634
00:58:28,481 --> 00:58:36,080
This is partly an answer to your question now about sort of you can't just be programmed, born programmed, period, to go to God.

635
00:58:36,081 --> 00:58:45,040
You are born sort of programmed to go to God in that you have a sign of desire that only God can satisfy, that you don't have to do it.

636
00:58:45,681 --> 00:58:53,201
Though why you don't, it's got this whole story about rebellion or stupidity or bad government.

637
00:58:53,201 --> 00:59:04,161
Dante's very much in thinking that it's the duty of the government to proscribe things that are bad for people, like addictive drugs.

638
00:59:04,161 --> 00:59:08,961
And he thinks it's the role of the church to tell people what they should be desiring.

639
00:59:08,961 --> 00:59:15,601
And that helps them from making stupid mistakes and going after the wrong sort of thing.

640
00:59:15,601 --> 00:59:17,840
So let's read more of this now.

641
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,681
I'm on 173.

642
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,121
The spheres do start, your impulses are wrong.

643
00:59:23,121 --> 00:59:25,921
That's just all what I'm trying to say to him.

644
00:59:26,081 --> 00:59:28,800
I do not say all, but suppose I did.

645
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,841
The light of reason still tells right from wrong.

646
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:39,521
And free will also, though it be strained in the first battles with the heaven, can conquer if it is sustained.

647
00:59:39,521 --> 00:59:42,401
And if that is the government and the church, help you.

648
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:50,601
You are free subjects of a more immense nature and power which grants your intellect to free you from the heaven's influences.

649
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:52,201
That's the anti-astrology.

650
00:59:52,521 --> 00:59:58,201
If therefore men today turn from God's law, the fault is with themselves, and so forth.

651
00:59:58,201 --> 01:00:05,641
Now, the next important thing relevant to your question is line 85, still on 170, page 173.

652
01:00:05,641 --> 01:00:12,841
Because this is where it turns out that everybody starts out headed toward God.

653
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:15,001
That is, with these desires.

654
01:00:15,001 --> 01:00:20,281
Remember, I quote the Augustine quote: that my soul is restless until it finds rest in thee.

655
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:27,720
That every soul comes into the world already pre-programmed by God with the desires that only God can satisfy.

656
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,801
But then they get off track.

657
01:00:30,121 --> 01:00:47,240
But here it says, From the hand of God, whose love shines like a ray upon it, even before birth, comes forth the simple soul, which, like a child at play, cries, laughs, and ignorant of every measure that is completely unvirgil-like.

658
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:52,521
But the glad impulse of its joyous maker turns eagerly to all that gives its pleasure.

659
01:00:52,521 --> 01:01:01,321
It tastes small pleasures first, to these it clings, deceived, it seeks no others, unless someone curb it or guide its love to higher things.

660
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,921
Well, that's very interesting.

661
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:12,760
So the baby tends to want to get too much out of the mother's breast and the mother's milk, or out of the, I don't know, playing with the cat or something.

662
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:18,240
It throws itself into all of those things and enjoys them immensely and would get stuck on them.

663
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:25,000
If it weren't that there is some kind of guidance from the parents and the church and the state.

664
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:32,001
That's the unless someone guide it's love to higher things.

665
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:34,881
So otherwise it will cling.

666
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:44,481
So it tastes small pleasures and clings deceived and seeks no others unless someone curb it or guide its love to higher things.

667
01:01:44,481 --> 01:01:48,560
Well, the someone curb it, that's Virgil, luckily.

668
01:01:48,561 --> 01:01:52,240
Although I think the state still has a role with drugs and stuff.

669
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,520
Or guides it to higher things, that's the role of the church.

670
01:01:55,521 --> 01:02:03,201
Dante's way into the separation of church and state, each of them with their own jobs and not to mess up with each other.

671
01:02:03,201 --> 01:02:14,081
And when it's, and so then free will can turn aside, but it needn't turn aside.

672
01:02:14,081 --> 01:02:19,360
And when it doesn't turn aside, then it should just get out of the way.

673
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,201
This is the crucial thing now.

674
01:02:21,521 --> 01:02:31,121
What should free will do, ideally, if God has set you up to desire what God can supply and nothing else can?

675
01:02:31,121 --> 01:02:37,601
And free will enables you to turn aside or to curb your desires.

676
01:02:37,601 --> 01:02:41,121
It follows that you should really get rid of your free will.

677
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:45,841
It's one of these things where autonomy and will is turned upside down.

678
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:55,601
Only like in the Odyssey, where receptiveness is valuable, and every time anybody tries to do something on their own rational willfulness, it goes bad.

679
01:02:55,601 --> 01:02:57,681
So here it's the same kind of thing.

680
01:02:58,001 --> 01:03:01,281
Openness is the right thing.

681
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:08,481
Once you've got openness, you're going off toward heaven like a rocket because that's where you're going to get your total fulfillment.

682
01:03:08,481 --> 01:03:19,641
And the best you can do with your free will is give it up and just do what comes natural.

683
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:23,000
That's what I think Beatrice is saying.

684
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,080
So free will can turn aside.

685
01:03:25,081 --> 01:03:29,641
Then you get to 189 in this discussion, and Beatrice finally does say something.

686
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:35,161
She doesn't say what you expect her to say, I think, if you've been believing Virgil.

687
01:03:35,481 --> 01:03:49,000
So she says on 189, line 43: if love springs from outside the soul's own will, with being made to love, what merit is there in loving good or blaming, loving ill?

688
01:03:49,001 --> 01:03:52,760
Oh, that's Dante asked that question of Lombardo.

689
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:55,640
Sorry, Beatrice will come along in a minute.

690
01:03:55,641 --> 01:04:04,760
But so Dante says, if your soul is just built for this, why don't you just do it?

691
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:09,161
And Lombardo says, as far as reason sees, I can reply.

692
01:04:09,161 --> 01:04:10,920
The rest you must ask Beatrice.

693
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:13,481
The answer lies with faith mysteries.

694
01:04:13,481 --> 01:04:16,680
Well, he never does get any answer from Beatrice.

695
01:04:16,681 --> 01:04:18,280
He never even asks Beatrice.

696
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:24,360
So this is the last word you get on it, I think, in Canto, what, 18.

697
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,121
I want to read the rest.

698
01:04:26,121 --> 01:04:29,161
Oh, yeah, well, anyway, it was a whole long thing we have to read.

699
01:04:29,161 --> 01:04:29,641
Where are we?

700
01:04:29,641 --> 01:04:31,720
We're in the purgatory, so you have it.

701
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,320
You better go read it too.

702
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:34,440
But I'll read it to you.

703
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,641
This is the last word on free will.

704
01:04:38,201 --> 01:04:40,760
Let me see where I have to go back to reading it.

705
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:50,920
So there's an innate appetite in you, as within the bee, that instinct to make honey, and such instincts are in themselves not blamable nor worthy.

706
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,281
That's where you start.

707
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:57,720
Now, that all, now that all later wills, this first bent may thrive.

708
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:01,640
The inner counsel of your reason must guard the threshold of consent.

709
01:05:01,641 --> 01:05:04,400
See, that's going to sound, that sounds just like Virgil.

710
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,401
I hope it isn't Virgil talking.

711
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,681
It might be.

712
01:05:07,681 --> 01:05:08,720
It's Virgil.

713
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:09,760
Okay, wow.

714
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:12,881
Well, did I just read that a minute ago already?

715
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,320
Or am I getting confused?

716
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:17,040
It's the same as he says earlier, where you have to curb it.

717
01:05:17,041 --> 01:05:20,881
This is another statement by Virgil of curbing it.

718
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,320
So there you are.

719
01:05:23,201 --> 01:05:31,841
Virgil is again saying, ask Beatrice, but he's telling you what he thinks: reason guides the threshold of consent, that line 63.

720
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:38,081
This is the principle from which accrue your just deserts and reaps and winnows good and evil in you.

721
01:05:38,081 --> 01:05:48,081
In other words, your good will is what guides you in the right direction, and your bad will takes you in the wrong direction, but it's all a question of will.

722
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,601
Now, let me go on, skipping a little.

723
01:05:51,601 --> 01:05:59,441
Or to put it another way, 70, all love, let us say, that burns in you springs from necessity, but you have the power to check its sway.

724
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,921
Again, again and again, this stoic thing.

725
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,681
Now comes this crazy line.

726
01:06:03,681 --> 01:06:07,521
These noble powers, Beatrice will comprehend this free will.

727
01:06:07,521 --> 01:06:13,121
Keep that term in mind when she when if she should speak of it, when you ascend.

728
01:06:13,121 --> 01:06:21,521
And then comes all this craziness, where the moon comes out and the people come rushing by saying faster and faster.

729
01:06:21,521 --> 01:06:29,201
So now we see that clearly Virgil is wrong.

730
01:06:29,201 --> 01:06:32,720
And nobody asks Beatrice.

731
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,400
So what do we think?

732
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:46,961
Well, I think what you're supposed to think is that free will can make you swerve aside from your natural tendency to seek the good.

733
01:06:47,161 --> 01:06:49,880
It's instinctual like bees making honey.

734
01:06:50,201 --> 01:06:55,880
And free will can come in and keep you from doing that by restraining you.

735
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:05,240
And free will can come in, and I don't know who says this, but it probably said somewhere, help you bend and swerve your will back in the right direction.

736
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:07,640
That's what happens in purgatory.

737
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:16,360
But in the end, you end up where you started as a baby, completely open with no will.

738
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:24,840
Only the difference is that you now have exactly going to whatever it is that is right for you and most satisfies you.

739
01:07:24,841 --> 01:07:32,760
Whereas the baby unfortunately gets hooked on everything it likes, from an ice cream to whatever.

740
01:07:33,801 --> 01:07:39,640
But like a baby, you're back just open and responding, I think.

741
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:44,760
Now I want to get to where that is crucial, so I have to jump ahead.

742
01:07:44,761 --> 01:07:46,201
And now we're ready for the end.

743
01:07:46,201 --> 01:07:50,041
I hope to get there, and I'll just jump to it and go back over it again.

744
01:07:50,041 --> 01:07:58,201
The end of the whole divine comedy, where you get to find out finally what happens with Dante and Beatrice and willpower.

745
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:06,680
And it's all, and you got it now in your pieces of the Paradiso.

746
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:15,400
First, the important thing is that when you finally get the vision of God, you will have been totally satisfied.

747
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:18,360
You won't need or want anything else.

748
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:27,560
But let's go, that's in line 100, page 364, Canto 33.

749
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:33,440
Experiencing that radiance, the spirit is so indrawn, it is impossible even to think of ever turning from it.

750
01:08:33,761 --> 01:08:41,121
For the good, which is the will's ultimate object, is all subsumed in it, and being removed, all is detected, did defective.

751
01:08:41,121 --> 01:08:42,881
So there you are, completely.

752
01:08:43,041 --> 01:08:46,240
And what consequence does that have once you see that?

753
01:08:47,041 --> 01:08:59,440
Where will Beatrice be once you see that God can give you everything you want, and turning from it will only diminish your joy and fulfillment?

754
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:01,121
Where's Beatrice?

755
01:09:01,121 --> 01:09:02,560
What's her place?

756
01:09:02,881 --> 01:09:04,400
Well, she's got to leave.

757
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:11,201
She vanishes the way Virgil vanished, only not quite so totally, but almost.

758
01:09:11,201 --> 01:09:20,161
That is, he looks around, and when they get up to the top and get in the presence of God, and Virgil is gone.

759
01:09:21,121 --> 01:09:22,640
Canto 31.

760
01:09:22,961 --> 01:09:30,960
He's looking into, and then line 55, he's looking into this wonderful vision he's having.

761
01:09:30,961 --> 01:09:36,320
And then, at the bottom, look at line 65.

762
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:38,960
She, where is she, I cried suddenly.

763
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:40,240
Dread.

764
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:46,881
And to lead you to your goal of all you wish, Beatrice offered me, called me for my place, he said.

765
01:09:46,881 --> 01:09:49,680
And Saint Bernard has now arrived.

766
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:51,760
And what happened to Beatrice?

767
01:09:51,761 --> 01:09:59,440
Well, Beatrice is now up in the rose, way close to God, with the saints where she belongs.

768
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:02,161
And Dante doesn't really need her anymore.

769
01:10:02,161 --> 01:10:06,720
And he thanks her as if she were Jesus on 341.

770
01:10:08,161 --> 01:10:30,360
And line 77, O lady in whom my hope shall ever soar, and who for my salvation suffered even to set foot your feet upon hell's broken floor, skipping a little, you have led me from my bondage and set me free by all those roads, by all those loving means that lay within your power and charity.

771
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:33,400
And that is, she's the way, obviously.

772
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:46,440
She's now getting out of the way, almost like a pun, to let him do, she has souped up his world so that nothing can satisfy him anymore except total fulfillment.

773
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:50,280
And now she gets out of his way and he gets the total fulfillment.

774
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:51,800
And where is she?

775
01:10:51,801 --> 01:10:53,720
This is line 91.

776
01:10:53,721 --> 01:11:01,240
Such was my prayer and she, far up a mountain, as it appeared to me, way up in the rose, looked down and smiled.

777
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:04,520
Then she turned back to the eternal fountain.

778
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:06,520
Well, the eternal fountain is God.

779
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,680
She's happy that Dante made it.

780
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:11,560
She smiles at him one time, and guess what?

781
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:13,960
I think they're never going to see each other again.

782
01:11:13,961 --> 01:11:23,400
Because why should they see each other and smile at each other when there's something that is infinitely satisfying and satisfies every desire they've got?

783
01:11:23,721 --> 01:11:31,081
So she gives him one last look and then she goes back to her place.

784
01:11:31,081 --> 01:11:33,081
And one more thing I have to say fast.

785
01:11:33,081 --> 01:11:46,760
And Dante, who has been so concerned about the world and all the political, social, church, state issues, which you haven't read, drops all concern with the world, naturally.

786
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:49,000
Nothing's important to him anymore.

787
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:51,800
I'm going to start there next time.

788
01:11:51,801 --> 01:12:01,760
I've passed out something that you can look at, where it now looks like all the earth is just trivial from where he is looking at things.

789
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:07,041
And I'm going to jump ahead, which I'll come back to, but I just have to end with this since we've been talking about the will.

790
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:24,240
And when he finally gets totally absorbed in contemplating God, which is totally fulfilling, two important things happen on page 365, all of which I will go back over slowly.

791
01:12:24,801 --> 01:12:27,280
He sees, no, I won't even mention this.

792
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,041
I just want to go directly to the will.

793
01:12:29,041 --> 01:12:34,720
The last stanza of it all is line 142.

794
01:12:34,721 --> 01:12:48,640
Here my powers rest from their high fantasy, but already I could feel my being turned, instinct and intellect balanced equally as a wheel whose motion nothing jars by the love that moves the sun and the other stars.

795
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,081
What is that happening?

796
01:12:50,081 --> 01:12:53,520
That means that the very, that's the last lines of the poem.

797
01:12:53,520 --> 01:13:02,480
That means that Dante's will has now come completely in sync with God's will, and that Dante really has no will of his own.

798
01:13:03,121 --> 01:13:06,800
I just wanted to read that to show you that there's no place left for free will.

799
01:13:07,921 --> 01:13:13,760
Free will is just the freedom to abandon all willing and to abandon even your own will.

800
01:13:13,761 --> 01:13:15,680
It's not Dante's will anymore.

801
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:17,201
He's got no identity.

802
01:13:17,201 --> 01:13:19,041
He's got no personality.

803
01:13:19,041 --> 01:13:24,240
He's become merged with the will of God that moves the sun and the other stars.

804
01:13:24,721 --> 01:13:26,720
He's lost Beatrice.

805
01:13:27,041 --> 01:13:34,081
He's lost, and I'll read the passage next time, all of his political involvements as if the earth had any meaning and was important.

806
01:13:34,041 --> 01:13:36,161
He does and why wouldn't he lose it?

807
01:13:36,161 --> 01:13:43,680
He's staring into what is the absolutely and completely fulfilling theatrical vision.

808
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:44,961
Okay, I'll go back over that.

809
01:13:44,961 --> 01:13:52,840
I went too fast at the end and then and then spend time discussing the implications of that and how that fits into the course.
