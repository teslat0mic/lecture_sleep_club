1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,360
We've done the city of dis, the wall, and then how Virgil didn't know how to get in, and how finally an angel is sent down by Beatrice to bash the door down, and they get into the city of diss.

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,240
And now we're ready to have different kinds of punishment.

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,320
That's where we're going to begin.

4
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:29,760
Outside of the wall of the fortress, remember, it's a fortress and not a prison.

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,680
And you'll see why, and that's relevant right now in a minute.

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,080
Outside the wall, there was wrongly directed desire.

7
00:00:40,401 --> 00:00:57,761
That is, desiring, making your whole world around romantic love like Paul and Francesca, or about food, or which you don't have to read and think about, or about material things.

8
00:00:57,761 --> 00:01:03,680
Those were all misdirected love in the language of St.

9
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,120
Thomas Aquinas.

10
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,120
It's not the language of Virgil.

11
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,041
Virgil doesn't understand that.

12
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:11,321
We'll get back to that later.

13
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:15,640
And now we're going to the crimes of turning away from God.

14
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:28,441
And sorry, no, those are all ways of turning away from God and making some lesser good, like sex and love and food or whatever, your God.

15
00:01:28,761 --> 00:01:32,760
And now we're going to rejecting God's creation.

16
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:42,120
And in effect, making your own will, your autonomous willpower, your God, the ultimate authority in your life.

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,440
The only authority that you pay any attention to is yourself.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,680
Those are the sinners.

19
00:01:48,680 --> 00:02:03,001
They have remembered that they have built the wall of the fortress to exclude God and that inside they have set up their own objects to love, always unnatural.

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:17,320
And I keep coming back because it's the simplest to the homosexuals who instead of engaging in heterosexual love willfully reject that which God made for people and made people for.

21
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:26,201
Damien, you know, was the natural, as they would say, thing to do, and made up their own unnatural pleasures.

22
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:29,000
And all of them are like that.

23
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:42,360
Within the fortress, they've rejected the things that are naturally attractive and go after things that are, they make, they choose to make attractive.

24
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:52,200
But the important thing, as far as they're being sinners, is concerned, is that they have rejected God's creation.

25
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:58,240
That is, the natural things and their natural attraction and the natural attraction of God.

26
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:27,520
And as you go down, this is the final sort of punchline, the sins are ranked by the fact that they reject more and more until at the very bottom, we have to skip all but the one on Odysseus just because we haven't got time, and because the punishments are pretty boring anyway, they're the you did so-and-so, and now we're going to do some funny trick on you that is the sort of opposite of what you were doing.

27
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:32,721
But we want to look at the very bottom ones because they are the worst.

28
00:03:32,721 --> 00:03:53,680
And what makes them the worst is they are the people who rejected even the claims on them of their country, which particularly Dante feels very, very strong patriotism, and their own intimate, their own children, and brothers and so forth.

29
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:17,680
They have rejected the most extreme form of claims and asserted their selfish, prideful autonomy, that only, after all, what they care about, what they choose to care about, counts.

30
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,321
Now we're going to just go into detail on one of the cantos, canto 26, on 221.

31
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:35,520
And our reason is because it's about Ulysses, that is Odysseus, as we called him when we were reading him in Greek.

32
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:44,281
Now in Latin, he's called Ulysses, and same person, but Dante's got a very different story than Homer to tell about him.

33
00:04:44,841 --> 00:04:58,120
And it tells a lot about the world, the difference between the world of Homer, the multi-worlds of Homer, and the very unified world of the creation.

34
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:04,041
I mean, I used to say the universe, but the universe is some special modern thing.

35
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:14,601
The universe is where the nebulae and the electrons and all are all in one system of causal interaction.

36
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:26,360
And I was worrying for a while, and the Greeks would have called their world the cosmos, which is the sort of lawful order of the planets as they saw it.

37
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:33,721
And I was trying to figure out for a while: what am I supposed to call the world of Dante?

38
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,481
If it isn't a cosmos, then it isn't a universe.

39
00:05:37,481 --> 00:05:40,281
Well, it was staring me in the face.

40
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:41,800
It's the creation.

41
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,400
That's what it's called.

42
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:50,120
If you've got a creator God, what the creator God creates is the creation, and we're all creatures.

43
00:05:50,120 --> 00:06:09,161
So now we're going to go down and just look at the different relation of Odysseus to his world or worlds and why and what's wrong with that from Dante's point of view.

44
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,961
It's the wrong way to relate to the creation.

45
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,641
Okay, so here we go.

46
00:06:14,281 --> 00:06:26,721
According to Dante, Odyssey goes directly from Circe without even going through Hades and without going home and heads directly toward the Mountain of Purgatory.

47
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
He doesn't know that's where he's heading.

48
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,561
He just heads out into the Atlantic Ocean to see what's there.

49
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:42,081
Now, and his punishment is in the circle of the false counselors.

50
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,441
Only we don't know yet what he was falsely counseling.

51
00:06:45,761 --> 00:06:49,681
His punishment exactly is to be a flame.

52
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,560
And now, sort of in a flame, only you can't even see him.

53
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,761
There's just a flame.

54
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:56,641
And the tongue of the flame is his tongue.

55
00:06:56,641 --> 00:07:03,361
And when the flame tongue waggles, then that's how he talks.

56
00:07:03,361 --> 00:07:06,961
And he's going to tell us his story in a second.

57
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,921
So why is he in the punishment for false counselors?

58
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:15,521
Well, look on 222.

59
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,041
And before we even get into his punishment, though, I better back up a tiny bit.

60
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:27,121
On 222, what's important is Dante's reaction to him.

61
00:07:27,121 --> 00:07:34,241
You won't understand yet why it's important till you understand what his false counseling was.

62
00:07:34,241 --> 00:07:45,441
But it's important already to see the third stanza, line 40, roughly, in Canto 26.

63
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:48,241
And this is Dante talking.

64
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:49,360
I stood on the bridge.

65
00:07:49,361 --> 00:07:55,840
It's a rock bridge overlooking this place down below where these flames are walking around.

66
00:07:56,001 --> 00:08:05,681
I stood on the bridge and leaned out from the edge so far that, but for a jut of rock I held to, I should have been sent hurtling from the ledge without being pushed.

67
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,521
And seeing me so intent, my guide said, there are souls within those flames.

68
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,441
Each sinner swathes himself in his own torment.

69
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:39,721
And the important thing to see is that Dante had a special relation to this sin, the way he almost got into the sin of Paula and Francesca, so much so that he was talking to them and then fainted because he felt so identified and empathetic with them.

70
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:44,361
So he somehow feels identified and empathetic with Odysseus.

71
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:50,521
That is something Odysseus has done that Dante is also tempted to do.

72
00:08:50,521 --> 00:08:52,761
And now we have to find out what.

73
00:08:53,080 --> 00:09:03,721
Well, there's a mention in line 59 of the ambush of the horse, but that's not false counseling.

74
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:10,440
So that's just making a trick that the Trojans fell for.

75
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:40,841
I don't think you get to the false counseling until you get to page 223, line about 85, where he says, not 85, 88, not fondness for my son, nor reverence for my aged father, nor Penelope's claim to the joys of love, could drive out of my mind the lust to experience the far-flung world and the failings and felicities of mankind.

76
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,001
And that's important.

77
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:50,281
That means what is finally motivating him that keeps him from going home and so forth.

78
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,080
When I read the Odyssey, I always puzzle about why he does go home.

79
00:09:56,401 --> 00:10:17,921
If his main interest is to go where no one has gone before and see what no one has seen before, then it's better that he just keeps traveling around and seeing more of these amazing sights and monsters and civilized people and like the Phaeacians and uncivilized people like the Cyclopses and so forth.

80
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:24,881
It's really peculiar that he does go home and it needs a lot of explaining, which I can't really do.

81
00:10:24,881 --> 00:10:35,041
Dante, I think, has a better intuition that the character, the Odyssey of many twists and turns, which is the first sentence of the Odyssey.

82
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:42,321
By the way, I decided the right way to translate that funny poly, what's the polytropic, the word that nobody knows how to translate.

83
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,561
I've decided that it's devious.

84
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,921
That's what he is.

85
00:10:46,401 --> 00:10:48,960
But I'm not sure, I mean, that doesn't capture it either.

86
00:10:48,960 --> 00:11:03,441
There's no one word to capture what the, but it's got to do with the fact that he's able to sort of get people to do things by sort of saying the right things to them.

87
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,241
He's able to change, you know, disguise himself and so forth.

88
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:19,681
So anyway, according to Dante, quite plausibly, he just sets out to go on to more adventures.

89
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,000
And now I have written in the margin, 254.

90
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:25,521
Why do I want to see 250?

91
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,601
No, we don't want to see 254.

92
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:34,080
And so, and now, but where's the false counseling that he's there for?

93
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,121
Not yet.

94
00:11:35,121 --> 00:11:42,360
So, he went on with his men who, and it's now what he says to them.

95
00:11:39,761 --> 00:11:44,760
That's why he's aflame with a tongue.

96
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:50,521
False counselors say false things and get people to do bad things.

97
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:51,800
And what does he say to them?

98
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,521
At the top of 224, he says just what he ought to say.

99
00:11:56,521 --> 00:12:08,601
Shipmates, I said, who through 100,000 perils have reached the West, did not deny to the brief remaining watch of our senses stand experience of the world beyond the sun.

100
00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:11,161
I don't know why he puts it that way, but it doesn't matter.

101
00:12:11,161 --> 00:12:13,080
The crucial thing is experience.

102
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,600
More experience.

103
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,121
That's what he really wants.

104
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:24,121
And then he says, Greeks, you were born to live like, not born to live like brutes, but to press on toward manhood and recognition.

105
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:38,521
I think, I don't know what manhood is exactly, but I take it sort of being mature, not in the Kantian sense of being autonomous, but growing up to be what human beings are at their best.

106
00:12:38,761 --> 00:12:46,121
We should be what human beings are at their best, and that is to have lots of experiences.

107
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:53,720
It's a common, it turns, I hadn't thought of putting it this way, it turns Odysseus from James Bond into Captain Kirk.

108
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,641
I was close to saying that.

109
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,681
And now the whole point is having lots of experiences.

110
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:09,080
And with this brief exhortation, I made my crew so eager for the voyage, I could hardly have held them back from it when I was through.

111
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:11,641
And that's the false counseling.

112
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:30,721
The false counseling is to say that the highest thing you can do, human beings can do, is have lots of experiences, see all the good things and the bad things that people can do, and that would be to be a human being at his or her best.

113
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:39,041
And to put it in our way, he says, let's experience other worlds, other gods.

114
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,521
Let's find new ways of getting in sin.

115
00:13:41,761 --> 00:13:50,321
After all, Zeus, the highest god, is the God of world crossers, so we should keep on crossing over into new worlds.

116
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,561
And that sounds right.

117
00:13:52,881 --> 00:13:56,321
That's more important than staying at home with Penelope.

118
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:17,361
That is, in a world, in an understanding of what it is to be a human being, where the top god is a god of strangers and guests, sort of settling down at home with your wife and kids and father and mother, it doesn't seem like the highest thing you could do.

119
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:25,041
And now, why is Dante sort of leaning over and almost falling into the punishment himself?

120
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:32,161
That's where sort of the medieval world comes to collide with the Homeric world.

121
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:40,320
Dante sees the attraction of what Odysseus is saying, but he says that it's false counseling.

122
00:14:40,321 --> 00:14:41,680
It's wrong.

123
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:45,040
And what's wrong?

124
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,641
Well, Dante, what's wrong is, so there are two things.

125
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:52,401
I don't know which way to start.

126
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:59,760
Okay, what's wrong with it is that you shouldn't just be out for experiences.

127
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,720
You should only have, there's only one thing that's important, and that is salvation.

128
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,960
And there's only one world, that is God's creation.

129
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,561
There's no way to explore new other worlds because there aren't any other worlds.

130
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:26,921
Wherever you turn in this creation, there's going to be the same kind of human beings and the same kind of love that is rewarding and the same kind of unnaturalness that is punishable and so forth.

131
00:15:26,921 --> 00:15:38,040
So the idea of going around and experiencing other worlds could only mean just like just like sort of having a lot of fun, getting thrills.

132
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:52,121
You're not really going to learn anything important, and you're going to be distracted from what is important, understanding better and better what it is that human beings really need, namely God, and how to get in touch with God.

133
00:15:52,440 --> 00:16:04,520
Now, the only missing piece is: why is Dante so dangerously tempted by the keep having experiences of other worlds?

134
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:28,360
Well, that's because he lives at this very interesting moment between the medieval time, which was a closed world, which was God's world, all organized hierarchically, everyone had their place, and everyone understood how to get from their place to the highest place, and everybody had this opportunity to go and have a direct vision of God if they lived a good life, and so forth.

135
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:56,401
Dante comes from that world into the Renaissance, which is happening in Italy then, which is the whole rediscovery of the Greeks and presumably, of the fact that there were these other than Christian worlds, and that and Dante is just fascinated by all kinds of other possible experiences, other possible places.

136
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:05,680
He would have gone on that boat ride out through the Straits of Gibraltar into the Atlantic to see what was there, just like Odysseus.

137
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,600
So it's dangerous for him.

138
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:11,280
I don't see where we are.

139
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:25,760
So it makes no sense to seek just new experiences, sensations, curiosities, see all the failures and felicities of mankind, as Odyssey puts it, just for its own sake.

140
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:32,560
If they don't teach you anything new about what's important, namely salvation, they're just a distraction.

141
00:17:32,561 --> 00:17:33,921
They have no merit.

142
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:37,680
They don't make for manhood or for human beings at their best.

143
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:45,520
And you can't get to purgatory and paradise by doing that kind of looking around.

144
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:47,601
And that's what happens.

145
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:51,520
The boat is headed for purgatory by accident, in a way.

146
00:17:51,520 --> 00:18:01,040
Odyssey didn't know that there was nothing out there in the southern hemisphere where he was heading, but the purgatory mountain, that they saw the mountain of purgatory.

147
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:08,401
And then at the bottom of 224, about line 125, they saw this peak that was very tall.

148
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:15,121
And then there was a storm, and the ship was turned around three times and sank.

149
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:24,881
And at the fourth, well, three times at the fourth, the bow went down and the sea closed over us, and the light was gone.

150
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:31,680
Their boat was sunk because they were on the wrong mission.

151
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,840
And Dante doesn't want to fall for that temptation.

152
00:18:35,841 --> 00:18:50,041
But if you read the whole book, you'd see that every time there's some new information about some other country or some scientific experiment or any sort of news about the open world, so to speak, Dante's interested in it.

153
00:18:50,040 --> 00:19:09,480
I mean, he's no polytheist, but he's also definitely thinks that anything that you can understand, even if it isn't directly edifying, that is directly leading you to God, is fascinating, and therefore he's fascinated by Odysseus.

154
00:19:10,121 --> 00:19:11,321
But he shouldn't be.

155
00:19:11,321 --> 00:19:29,560
I mean, he's, because he was in the dark woods, because he was in despair, he's been put on this mission to discover how to lead a good Christian medieval life by Beatrice and God and the Virgin Mary all and cooperating and so forth.

156
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:31,881
And that's what he should be worrying about.

157
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:46,440
And he shouldn't be paying any attention to any of the kind of interesting quotes, interesting things about which he's so curious, because they don't matter unless they teach you how to be a better person.

158
00:19:46,760 --> 00:20:17,641
Okay, so that's anybody want to say that's all I have to say about the Odyssey one, but it's kind of a little window into the difference between polytheism and multi-world people like the Homeric Greeks, who had to remember lots of worlds were whooshing up and lots of gods, and the kind of closed world of the medievals where it's all created by one God in one hierarchical order, and it's all the same all over, and it all points toward God.

159
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:23,881
Couldn't be more different, what God and gods are and what human beings' jobs are than that.

160
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:30,000
Okay, now, anybody want to say anything about that, or we'll go on to the next events?

161
00:20:30,321 --> 00:20:30,801
Yeah.

162
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,600
Would it not be a good thing to do?

163
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:41,360
Interesting, interesting.

164
00:20:42,321 --> 00:20:47,680
My first thought is it's fine to admire the whole creation.

165
00:20:47,841 --> 00:21:00,000
Now, this is sort of me talking, and it may turn out to be wrong, but what I was saying earlier, sir, my feel is that there's no point in going anywhere else because the whole creation is all the same.

166
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:13,200
Whether you stay at home and admire every little thing and love every little thing because God made it, or whether you go off to Bali, you won't see the Bali people worshiping some other God in this perspective.

167
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,321
You'll just see them doing the same things that we do.

168
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:22,881
So, there isn't, as soon as you get into the Renaissance, you can rephrase it that way.

169
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:29,440
And I think Shakespeare, for instance, would have understood looking at all the different wonders of creation.

170
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,600
But I don't think in Dante there's any point in looking at anything.

171
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:47,200
Anything you see is God's creation, and anything you see has a certain amount of fulfillment value, and you should get your love in sync with it, I think.

172
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,680
Beatrice, did you want to say something?

173
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,280
Ah, well, good.

174
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,680
Well, but he's exiled, you mean?

175
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,280
No, he goes on a journey.

176
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,921
I thought the business would be something about what he had.

177
00:22:00,161 --> 00:22:04,320
The journey through hell, and yeah, the journey, the big journey, the book journey.

178
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:14,841
He goes on a, yes, he goes on a journey, and it's to see a what now between the two of you.

179
00:22:14,841 --> 00:22:16,440
I have to figure out this.

180
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:28,360
He he sees all of creation, all right, and that's a lot of stuff, all the inferno and all of purgatory, and it's important that he does that.

181
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:44,040
But it's always with the final edifying direction that he should see it only insofar as it teaches him the right way to get into the relation to this creator, God.

182
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:50,121
He shouldn't see it as a variety of worlds interesting in their own right.

183
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:56,361
As soon as you do, you go from being a pilgrim, which is what he's called.

184
00:22:56,361 --> 00:23:00,361
I don't know by whom, but I mean, by Chiardi, and that's all right.

185
00:23:00,361 --> 00:23:14,121
The pilgrim is on a trip and he sees lots of things, but he's got one goal, and they're all supposed to be teaching something such that he will find and appreciate that goal.

186
00:23:14,121 --> 00:23:18,520
Whereas you try to think, you can't think of Odysseus as a pilgrim.

187
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:27,000
He's not going any one place, and he's not going to find out, he's not going anywhere to find out about his salvation.

188
00:23:28,601 --> 00:23:29,561
He's a what?

189
00:23:29,561 --> 00:23:30,841
I don't know what's the word.

190
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,000
Well, what was Captain Kirk?

191
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,760
Yeah.

192
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:39,480
Yes, that's what I couldn't be the case for Dante.

193
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:39,641
Right.

194
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:49,240
If the journey is an end in itself, but even in every bit of each piece of the journey, which just comes to the same thing, the more worlds you see, the better.

195
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,401
And that's the point in this.

196
00:23:51,401 --> 00:23:56,480
But everything that you see has to point toward finally getting the right relation to God.

197
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,881
That's the point if you're a pilgrim.

198
00:23:58,881 --> 00:24:02,801
It's a subtle difference, but a really, really clear one, I think.

199
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:17,200
And that's, I mean, and if you don't, that's, you only see it if you see why he's so tempted by and yet trying hard to be utterly different from Odysseus.

200
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,241
And that's so that he has to see all of this as he says.

201
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:33,601
He has to see all these aspects of creation, but they don't, they always teach him the same thing, so to speak, which, and now I don't know what to say.

202
00:24:33,601 --> 00:24:36,240
I want to say something like, he could have learned at home.

203
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,760
You don't have to go on this trip, you wouldn't think, to become saved.

204
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,121
Why did he have to go?

205
00:24:43,121 --> 00:24:46,560
I'm just trying to figure this out as you guys push me into it.

206
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,200
I can't imagine.

207
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,401
I mean, he's the only one who did this trip in the history of the West.

208
00:24:54,401 --> 00:25:00,641
And so there's something very peculiar, maybe a kind of loophole that there's no fixing.

209
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:17,121
I can't think of any reason why, however, he was lost in this dark woods, despairing, disoriented, having affairs with other women, Beatrice accuses him of, among other things.

210
00:25:17,921 --> 00:25:22,880
And getting into this political squabbles and turning out to be on the wrong side.

211
00:25:22,881 --> 00:25:31,680
All of that, none of that would seem to motivate having to go to the bottom of hell, to the top of purgatory, in order to get to paradise.

212
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,440
Nobody else seemed to ever had to do that.

213
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:50,601
I could give a kind of version of it that would be later Kierkegaardian kind of thinking, that you have to go to the very bottom of despair before you can come out on the other side.

214
00:25:50,601 --> 00:25:52,680
But that doesn't seem to be a Dante thing.

215
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:58,841
It isn't as if he gets more and more despairing as he goes down to the bottom of the inferno.

216
00:25:58,841 --> 00:26:06,520
He's already hit bottom in the dark woods, and then he has to go on this whole trip, and then he gets to see God.

217
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,401
I'm stumped.

218
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:11,641
If anybody knows an answer to this, let me praise the question clearly.

219
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:27,480
Why does Dante have to make this extended pilgrimage to end up with a vision of God thousands or tens of thousands or maybe millions of other people have had without making this trip?

220
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,440
I don't know.

221
00:26:28,601 --> 00:26:30,040
You have an idea?

222
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:43,720
Well, in a way, that's what you have to say: that Dante's doing it so that all of us can learn all the wrong ways of doing things so that we can avoid them and finally end up doing the right way of doing things.

223
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:49,641
Yeah, he doesn't, I mean, that sort of somewhat conflicts with the dark woods.

224
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,000
Well, not really.

225
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:58,921
I suppose he's lost, and therefore he, and everybody's sooner or later lost.

226
00:26:58,921 --> 00:27:08,601
And I still don't really understand too well why you have to see all these things which he doesn't have even an inkling of doing.

227
00:27:08,601 --> 00:27:19,720
I mean, he's not interested in collecting material possessions, and he's not a schismatic, and he's not a bad kind of lawyer, and he's not a murderer.

228
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:35,600
Why he has to see that all these things are wrong and produce bad things, except if, as David says, it's not really Dante who has to see them for himself, but he sees them to report this for everybody, to help everybody.

229
00:27:35,601 --> 00:27:37,760
He certainly doesn't present it that way.

230
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:51,360
And see, yeah, it's a kind of summing up of all the wrong ways, and finally, at the end, all the right ways when you get to the Paradiso of getting a completely fulfilling life.

231
00:27:51,361 --> 00:27:54,320
And Dante is going to show it to us.

232
00:27:54,321 --> 00:28:04,240
But I think there's a kind of tension between that and the idea that he's personally lost and that it's for him that Beatrice came down to do this and so forth.

233
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,800
I think probably you're supposed to read it both ways.

234
00:28:08,801 --> 00:28:13,440
I mean, but I don't understand really the for him part.

235
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:29,680
I think David's got a view of the for everybody part because this is going to teach whatever your temptation is, it will show you sort of what an ugly thing that really is and what a terrible life in eternity you're going to have if you go on doing it.

236
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:40,881
And then it's going to show you how to try to get over your addictions and your willful pride in purgatory, and then it's going to show you all the rewards you're going to get in paradise.

237
00:28:40,881 --> 00:28:47,601
That's for each person, some other, some part of the book or other should show them something edifying.

238
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:54,641
And that still leaves me a little puzzled about whether Dante himself gets edified by it.

239
00:28:54,641 --> 00:28:55,680
Okay, Beatrice, yeah.

240
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,800
And which is the she-wolf?

241
00:29:11,801 --> 00:29:13,720
I don't remember which animal is which.

242
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,361
Yeah, but one of them, each of them symbolizes something.

243
00:29:16,361 --> 00:29:21,960
I'm just curious which bad thing is he most endangered by.

244
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,840
Really, I hope so.

245
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:28,760
Because I don't think of Dante as pride, autonomy, and so forth.

246
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:46,040
I think I think of him as either overwhelmed too much love for Beatrice, which I don't think he could possibly have by his chivalric thing, or he's got these temptations to anger, and he's got those temptations to other women, and I guess that's what's his problem.

247
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,560
But it's clearly much bigger than his problem somehow.

248
00:29:49,881 --> 00:29:50,841
I mean, the book.

249
00:29:50,841 --> 00:30:00,121
I mean, for that, those little problems, people have had them and gotten and gotten over them without having to see the whole moral universe or moral creation.

250
00:30:01,161 --> 00:30:10,121
And I think David's right, but I think there's no easy way to say that this is for everybody.

251
00:30:10,121 --> 00:30:12,360
You've got to figure that out for yourself.

252
00:30:12,361 --> 00:30:19,881
Dante wants to tell it as a story about his life and his relation to Beatrice and so forth.

253
00:30:19,881 --> 00:30:21,321
Okay, I can't do better.

254
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:24,361
If anybody can put it together in a paper, that would be terrific.

255
00:30:24,361 --> 00:30:24,760
Yeah.

256
00:30:28,841 --> 00:30:31,081
Ah, that's nice.

257
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:33,320
I wonder what that is in Italian.

258
00:30:35,881 --> 00:30:39,401
You got the inferno in Italian, right, Beatrice?

259
00:30:39,801 --> 00:30:41,881
He wants to know, oh, he does.

260
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,881
Well, and it says in the middle of our life.

261
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,001
Okay, great.

262
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,041
I didn't realize you had it.

263
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,921
Terrific.

264
00:30:46,921 --> 00:30:48,761
So that's good.

265
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,720
That's helpful.

266
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,841
You see what he's saying?

267
00:30:50,841 --> 00:31:04,720
So Dante sort of builds in the generalization that he's not just talking about in the middle of my life I found myself in the dark woods, but sooner or later everybody in their own way goes astray and finds themselves in the dark woods.

268
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:12,161
And this book has got something in it for everybody who finds themselves in the dark woods, not just Dante.

269
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,480
I think that must be how it's supposed to work.

270
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:33,121
It still has this peculiar feature that even why it doesn't, why each person in their own way didn't find their own pilgrimage, but why anybody has to go through seeing all of this ugly scene, and I still don't understand.

271
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:45,120
But if you do say, well, but this is a book for everybody and that's how they took it, then it makes sense because surely somebody who's reading it needs to experience each of these punishments.

272
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:53,601
I mean, the one that's important for them, Dante's tempted by the anger punishment.

273
00:31:53,921 --> 00:31:56,640
I mean, it's interesting to try to keep track.

274
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,001
Certainly, he faints for Paula and Francesca.

275
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,681
He gets involved, I forget how, in the anger punishment, but you could look.

276
00:32:06,321 --> 00:32:18,001
He gets very nearly into the homosexual punishment because he wants to talk to his old homosexual teacher and he has to go under the falling fire flakes to do it.

277
00:32:18,881 --> 00:32:24,801
And he almost falls into the Odysseus temptation.

278
00:32:24,801 --> 00:32:36,801
And he has to go through, you'll see the fire at the top of the purgatory, which is purging lovers of any kind of misdirection in their love.

279
00:32:37,921 --> 00:32:41,080
So you can see that there, Dante, maybe that's part of it.

280
00:32:41,321 --> 00:32:52,921
Dante sort of includes in the book a kind of distinction, which I was bringing out, but I wasn't really paying attention to it, between the sense in which this is specifically relevant to him.

281
00:32:52,921 --> 00:33:00,201
And you can find out by looking to see which punishments he is close to falling into and has to be warned about.

282
00:33:01,801 --> 00:33:15,401
It's interesting that he sort of sometimes he's telling you in one level about his life, and then he's emphasizing which punishments he really cares are important and edifying for him.

283
00:33:15,401 --> 00:33:20,601
And sometimes he's telling you about human life, our life, and then he gives you all the punishments.

284
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,601
That's helpful a little, yeah?

285
00:33:22,921 --> 00:33:23,560
That's right.

286
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,440
Good, good, good.

287
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:40,361
Because it's this kind of hierarchical system, you have to understand why this sin, if it's inside the city, or this, what's the opposite, what's other than sin, because sin is always rebellion and rejection of God.

288
00:33:40,361 --> 00:33:43,321
What about these people who love too much?

289
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,960
With this, I just need a word, vice.

290
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,841
How's that?

291
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,881
The virtues and vices talk will do.

292
00:33:52,520 --> 00:34:00,361
We need to understand each vice and why it's wrong and how wrong it is.

293
00:34:00,361 --> 00:34:07,160
And that's the sense in which all of the, and they all relate to each other.

294
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:14,921
I mean, you have to understand why gluttony is a worse vice than too much romantic passion.

295
00:34:14,921 --> 00:34:38,320
And you have to understand why the people, why the homosexuals are worse than the, or at least the promiscuous ones in hell, are worse off than the lovers and worse off than the happy homosexuals you'll see at the top of the parody of the purgatory who are monogamous and so forth.

296
00:34:38,321 --> 00:34:40,321
And all that is in a big system.

297
00:34:40,321 --> 00:34:41,040
And you're right.

298
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,720
You have to understand any one of them as worser or less than another.

299
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,881
That's what you're thinking.

300
00:34:47,201 --> 00:34:52,960
Okay, well, that's all sort of important and somewhat exhausting.

301
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,841
I guess now I wasn't going to talk about something, which now I have to, but it's not in your reading.

302
00:34:58,401 --> 00:34:59,921
But we come so close.

303
00:34:59,921 --> 00:35:17,281
If I list all the places where Dante gets into trouble, one of them is a place where he is looking at what's going on as if it were entertainment instead of edifying.

304
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:24,321
He's not learning about how it affects his life, and it's a temptation for him, presumably.

305
00:35:24,321 --> 00:35:32,721
This is on page 254, this is Canto 30, line 120.

306
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:49,760
There people are sort of yelling at each other and putting each other down like a kind of sitcom, and they're making, they're insulting each other, and I guess are they punching each other?

307
00:35:49,761 --> 00:35:50,721
I'm not sure.

308
00:35:50,721 --> 00:35:51,440
I don't think so.

309
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,001
They're just sort of insulting each other.

310
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,921
And Dante's finding this very exciting and fun, just like watching a sitcom.

311
00:35:59,921 --> 00:36:05,440
And he gets in trouble for it on 254, the bottom half of the page, about line 130.

312
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,001
I was still standing fixed upon those two.

313
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,921
Those are the ones insulting each other.

314
00:36:10,281 --> 00:36:16,041
And when the master said to me, Now keep on looking a little longer and I quarrel with you.

315
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:22,120
When I heard my master raise his voice to me, I wheeled about with such a start of shame that I grow pale yet at the memory.

316
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,881
See, he's involved again.

317
00:36:24,841 --> 00:36:37,001
He's gone in, he's taken in, he's enjoying this kind of activity instead of realizing that it's a bad thing and trying to see it's what you're supposed to not do it.

318
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,081
And then I think that's enough.

319
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,721
Yeah.

320
00:36:41,881 --> 00:36:52,521
So it's interesting that that's the only other place I know of where he sort of puts himself into the story as an almost sinner.

321
00:36:52,520 --> 00:37:01,401
Okay, now we want to jump ahead to the bottom of hell, because we need to talk about that too before we can get on to purgatory.

322
00:37:01,401 --> 00:37:08,921
And that the bottom of hell is the worst.

323
00:37:08,921 --> 00:37:11,480
Oh, I left out a little something on 255.

324
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,321
My book is still open to it.

325
00:37:13,881 --> 00:37:24,681
What Virgil says when he explains why Dante shouldn't do it, it says to wish to hear such baseness is degrading.

326
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,440
That means something like, well, not all experience is edifying.

327
00:37:30,761 --> 00:37:36,680
Some experiences are just, I don't know, stupefying or brutalizing and so forth.

328
00:37:36,681 --> 00:37:40,601
And Dante had better not be going around collecting those experiences.

329
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,681
Okay, now we're going to go to the bottom of hell.

330
00:37:42,681 --> 00:38:04,960
The bottom of hell are the people who are the most bad, that is the most prideful, that is the most self-suff sufficient or trying to be self-sufficient, and they've excluded themselves in the name of autonomy from ever getting fulfilled by God's love.

331
00:38:05,281 --> 00:38:12,561
And now there's a bit of important psychology here that Dante believes.

332
00:38:15,281 --> 00:38:22,401
And it's going to turn out to be very important later when Virgil explains the whole system of all these punishments.

333
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:24,720
That is, God has created the world.

334
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:29,761
This is a very important thing to just say sometime, and right now just as well.

335
00:38:29,761 --> 00:38:37,280
God has created the world with stuff with all sorts of varying degrees of fulfilling power.

336
00:38:38,241 --> 00:38:47,520
Other bodies, good food, material possessions, power, I suppose.

337
00:38:47,921 --> 00:38:49,760
I don't know how to put it.

338
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,560
But everything, you should know.

339
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,960
And you should sort of love, or now love means desire.

340
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,880
It doesn't mean agape love.

341
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:01,361
It doesn't mean erotic love either.

342
00:39:01,361 --> 00:39:06,801
You should just desire things in proportion to how satisfying they are.

343
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:21,681
So that is at the top of the list of things that are pretty satisfying, except that if you go into them with 100% the way Paolo and Francesca do, then they get to have their own drawback.

344
00:39:21,921 --> 00:39:32,641
But each thing then is, all of it's created by God's love, and we're cree and each thing is created with a certain amount of fulfilling power.

345
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:57,320
And we're created, I call that, I think, homing missiles from Augustine-like, that is, and we're created as needing total fulfillment and getting a certain amount of fulfillment out of all these created things, and seeking total fulfillment, none of them can satisfy us except finally a direct vision of God.

346
00:39:57,321 --> 00:39:59,081
That's the picture.

347
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,321
Now, why do you need to know it now?

348
00:40:01,321 --> 00:40:05,401
Well, because of the peculiar character of the people at the bottom of the inferno.

349
00:40:05,401 --> 00:40:07,000
You've all read it, I hope.

350
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,560
How many know what the punishment is for the people at the bottom of the inferno?

351
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,201
The really, really bad people?

352
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,800
One or two.

353
00:40:15,801 --> 00:40:17,801
You only, the rest of you don't know.

354
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,080
Are they in hellfire and brimstone?

355
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,921
Are they cooked for eternity?

356
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,640
No, they're frozen solid in ice.

357
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:32,440
It's marvelous how different Dante's view of evil is from the Protestant view of evil.

358
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:42,440
For Dante, they are immobile, frozen in ice, and that's because you need just one phrase to understand it.

359
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:52,201
If you're open to the attractiveness of things, then you are moved by the light, food, or romantic love again, and so forth.

360
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:55,241
And now it's a pun on move, the way I'm saying it.

361
00:40:55,241 --> 00:40:58,921
When you're moved by something, you are literally moved.

362
00:40:58,921 --> 00:41:01,960
That is, you don't do anything or act.

363
00:41:02,281 --> 00:41:13,400
People don't do anything or act except insofar as they're moved literally by the attractiveness of the various things in God's creation.

364
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:26,480
And that means if you reject God's creation and its attractiveness and want to be autonomous, then you get less and less moved the more autonomous you get.

365
00:41:27,361 --> 00:41:33,121
So if you got to be completely autonomous, you'd be completely immobilized.

366
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,841
Nothing would be attractive for you.

367
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:56,881
And since nothing was attractive for you, since all attractiveness finally comes from God, and you rejected God, then you are just, and you are cold because you aren't emotionally involved, you aren't passionate, you aren't loving, you aren't open to anything.

368
00:41:56,881 --> 00:42:01,680
I mean, even the guy who loves his white BMW convertible isn't cold.

369
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:10,641
He's got a rather limited object, and he's over, he's obviously over-committed to it.

370
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:19,521
But to be really, really cold is to have no attractions at all because you're so self-sufficient.

371
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:28,641
And that is so prideful that you won't accept to give up your willpower for the attractiveness of anything.

372
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,121
That's then, you know, the line better to rule in hell than serve in heaven.

373
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:41,201
And if you won't give up your willpower for anything, finally you won't be moved by anything.

374
00:42:41,201 --> 00:42:43,281
And that's why you're in the ice.

375
00:42:44,241 --> 00:42:57,440
And that's that, the ice is just the realization of that, that is the sort of dramatization of the fact that these people are cold and not moved by anything.

376
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:17,161
The more you get to the bottom, the more you find people who have turned against their lords, their bosses, their brothers, their family, their country, and the more we find these sinners who, having refused all attractions, are just like rocks.

377
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:22,361
Dante kicks one of the heads of the people frozen in ice, and Virgil says that's a good thing.

378
00:43:22,361 --> 00:43:27,960
Don't feel bad about it when he trips over it, because they're just objects.

379
00:43:28,681 --> 00:43:30,841
These really, really bad people.

380
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,881
They're the ultimately unresponsive people, unopened.

381
00:43:38,201 --> 00:43:44,041
They refuse all connections to stay self-sufficient.

382
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,721
And that's it.

383
00:43:47,721 --> 00:43:53,801
I just wanted you to notice, I mean, how different that is than thinking that hell is hot.

384
00:43:53,801 --> 00:44:05,400
I mean, in Milton's Paradise Lost, which I mention every once in a while, and which I think I may have said I had in this course until I discovered that nobody, neither the students nor I could really understand it.

385
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,121
Has anybody read Paradise Lost?

386
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,720
It's very, very hard.

387
00:44:09,721 --> 00:44:11,161
You read it in high school?

388
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,921
Wow, that must be quite a high school.

389
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,761
Did you understand something?

390
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:15,561
No.

391
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,640
Okay, well, that's what I was afraid of.

392
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:23,001
Okay, anyway, but this much is clear: that Milton has lost the sense.

393
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,160
Well, let me put it to the first one, he's lost.

394
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,680
For Dante and St.

395
00:44:26,681 --> 00:44:30,681
Thomas, evil is non-being.

396
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:43,960
And that means sort of the eviler you get, meaning the more self-sufficient you get, the more you reject the attractiveness of the creation, the more you are just impotent.

397
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:53,721
And so you get to Satan, who's frozen in the ice at the bottom, isn't flying around rallying his troops the way he is in Milton.

398
00:44:53,721 --> 00:45:01,120
He's just, he's all he can do is flap his wings and act as the kind of refrigerator for this lowest part of hell.

399
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,681
He's the one who's cooling the ice.

400
00:45:03,681 --> 00:45:15,521
But the important thing is that in Dante, evil is finally sort of self-destructive and weak.

401
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:29,761
Whereas Milton really believes in the power of free will and really has Satan full of energy, running around defying God, rallying the truth, setting up a whole other world, other community in hell.

402
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,440
And heat is somehow associated with that.

403
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,241
I mean, I don't even understand the Protestant story.

404
00:45:40,241 --> 00:45:44,000
I mean, why should hell be full of fire and brimstone?

405
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,681
Why not ice?

406
00:45:46,881 --> 00:45:50,881
Why should evil people be hotter than non-evil?

407
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:53,280
You can understand Dante better, I think.

408
00:45:53,281 --> 00:45:58,081
I mean, I can understand the view that says that evil people are colder.

409
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,640
And the eviler they get, the colder they get.

410
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,440
I can't understand the idea that Satan is full of energy.

411
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,081
And Milton seems to admire that.

412
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:24,881
Well, I guess I really think is that Milton and the Protestants are sort of already in the modern world where will and energy are thought of as good things and not as rejecting what God has to offer.

413
00:46:24,881 --> 00:46:28,840
So, in any case, I'm going to just.

414
00:46:28,841 --> 00:46:39,001
So, in modernity, we have an active, willful, Protestant Satan, and Milton admires his energy.

415
00:46:40,201 --> 00:46:41,720
And then let's go to the end.

416
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:44,281
So, we're down at the bottom of hell, 283.

417
00:46:46,841 --> 00:46:53,801
There's one last joke, which Shiardi doesn't get, or else he's too prudish to tell it.

418
00:46:53,801 --> 00:46:56,601
I wonder if you get it or got it.

419
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,081
Or maybe I'm making it up, but I don't think so.

420
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:12,440
Okay, so there's Satan on 283, the very beginning of Canto 34, like a whirling windmill, there he is, stirring up a bitter wind, and so forth.

421
00:47:12,761 --> 00:47:18,440
And that's and now he's hideous looking and so forth.

422
00:47:18,761 --> 00:47:21,881
And look at this, those three faces.

423
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:24,601
I just noticed this for the first time: 40.

424
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:30,521
One was in front, and it was fiery red, and the other ones were what?

425
00:47:30,841 --> 00:47:34,361
White and yellow.

426
00:47:34,681 --> 00:47:37,881
I don't know, it wasn't fiery red in the sense of hot.

427
00:47:38,281 --> 00:47:42,520
I'm sure, although I'm surprised that Dante calls it fiery red.

428
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:46,841
That seems to me a kind of glitch in the poetry.

429
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:51,241
But anyway, we get to page 285, line 75.

430
00:47:51,241 --> 00:47:54,521
They finally reach the bottom of the world.

431
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,600
But that's already a sort of pun.

432
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:00,761
The bottom of the world is Satan's bottom.

433
00:48:00,761 --> 00:48:18,121
And because he's imprisoned in the ice with his upper part sticking up into the inferno and his lower part sticking into that sort of empty space where between the inferno and and the paradiso.

434
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:26,241
So he's if this, so down here, I don't think I drew it quite far enough down.

435
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:33,121
So down here, Satan is in here and his head is up here.

436
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:39,921
That's where he's got the three in his mouth he's chewing Brutus and Cassius.

437
00:48:39,921 --> 00:48:41,361
and Judas.

438
00:48:41,361 --> 00:48:46,880
By the way, just parenthetically, look how committed to politics Dante is.

439
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,800
He's got these three bad people.

440
00:48:50,801 --> 00:48:52,000
You can see why he has three.

441
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,081
It's sort of the opposite of the Trinity.

442
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:58,080
But of the three, one is the betrayer of Jesus.

443
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,161
You'd think, I mean, that would be pretty serious, super serious.

444
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:10,800
And then Brutus and Cassius, who killed Julius Caesar and brought about the change of the Roman Empire into an empire.

445
00:49:10,801 --> 00:49:13,201
And Dante has views about that.

446
00:49:13,201 --> 00:49:21,361
And oddly enough, he's put in the mouth of Satan those three, one too political and one religious bad guy.

447
00:49:21,361 --> 00:49:42,960
And then the legs of Satan stick down here into the space that is a sort of crack that Virgil and Dante go to to get to purgatory, which is made out of the dirt that's hollowed out of the inferno and out of this space in here.

448
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:50,561
But and the bottom of the world is the where the most bad matter is.

449
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:57,681
And so as you go down, things get more and more just plain matter.

450
00:49:57,681 --> 00:50:04,960
And as you go up and up, they get more and more spiritual until you go way up into the Paradiso, where they're completely spiritual.

451
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,841
So, what happens when they reach the very bottom at the two two eighty five, seventy five?

452
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:19,321
When we have reached the joint where the great thigh merges with the spelling of the haunch, that's literally the bottom of Venus Lee.

453
00:50:19,321 --> 00:50:23,480
And then Virgil has to turn around.

454
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:35,641
They've been climbing this way, and now they turn around at Satan's bottom and start climbing up this way along his legs.

455
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:46,761
And so his master screening turned his head to where his feet had been and began to grip the hair as if he was climbing so that he moved toward the world.

456
00:50:46,761 --> 00:50:50,761
So where do they turn around when they've really reached the bottom?

457
00:50:50,761 --> 00:50:52,600
Well, it's Satan's anus.

458
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:56,440
It's the asshole of the world, the way Dante sets it up.

459
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,040
There's no question about it.

460
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:02,761
Chiardi just doesn't tell you that in the footnote, but you can figure it out.

461
00:51:02,761 --> 00:51:06,201
And that makes perfect sense in this picture of creation.

462
00:51:06,201 --> 00:51:15,321
So there they are at the absolute bottom of Satan, and then they climb up here and they get to purgatory.

463
00:51:15,321 --> 00:51:17,720
So now we're going to get to purgatory.

464
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,640
Any comments, though?

465
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,320
We're just leaving the inferno.

466
00:51:21,321 --> 00:51:27,480
It's time anybody who wants to say anything about life in the inferno should say it now.

467
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:33,721
Usually somebody has some hard question or some objection, and we learn something.

468
00:51:33,721 --> 00:51:39,960
We've already got enough hard questions already about the journey and who's at the pilgrim and who is benefiting from it.

469
00:51:41,241 --> 00:51:42,361
I haven't learned something yet.

470
00:51:42,361 --> 00:51:44,921
I've learned something to worry about, but that's the first stage.

471
00:51:44,921 --> 00:51:53,881
You start to worry about something, and if you're lucky and if Dante is smart enough, there's something deep going on that you can find out.

472
00:51:53,881 --> 00:51:55,680
And the hour journey is the hint.

473
00:51:55,681 --> 00:51:57,120
But anyway, onward now.

474
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,880
We're going to purgatory.

475
00:51:59,201 --> 00:52:03,361
And for all these.

476
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:05,200
Thanks.

477
00:52:05,201 --> 00:52:05,680
Okay.

478
00:52:05,681 --> 00:52:07,921
So I'm just going to sum up quickly.

479
00:52:07,921 --> 00:52:14,480
From eternal torment, you go to a new kind of torment, which lasts for a long time.

480
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:21,440
But it's a different kind of torment because it's no longer meant to punish you forever.

481
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:28,881
But it's the kind of suffering that an addict has to go through to get over their addiction.

482
00:52:28,881 --> 00:52:38,001
Whether the whole purgatory is filled with recovering addicts who repented and have chosen to try to get over their addictions.

483
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,360
So the punishments look like the bad kind of inversions of the inferno.

484
00:52:43,361 --> 00:52:49,280
For instance, the gluttons are the food they desire most is right out of reach.

485
00:52:49,281 --> 00:52:51,681
They get a punishment from tantalus.

486
00:52:51,681 --> 00:53:01,841
But those gluttons are people who are, in effect, dieting, starving themselves in order to get over their desire for food.

487
00:53:01,841 --> 00:53:03,200
And it's true of all of them.

488
00:53:03,201 --> 00:53:12,161
They're bending over, literally bending over backwards, some of them, like the pride people are carrying heavy weights and are all bent over because they were all too high.

489
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:22,960
They're all being voluntarily suffering the opposite of their particular kind of addiction so as to get over it.

490
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,801
And when they do, then they can go on to paradise.

491
00:53:26,801 --> 00:53:28,161
And it's up to them.

492
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,680
They'll know when they're.

493
00:53:29,921 --> 00:53:36,001
And notice I never said this before, but obviously, what's being fixed are their desires.

494
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,280
This is Christian.

495
00:53:37,281 --> 00:53:41,320
It's not that they're learning to behave like not eating food.

496
00:53:41,321 --> 00:53:42,120
This is important.

497
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,801
How did I never say this before?

498
00:53:43,801 --> 00:53:52,601
It isn't as if they've learned just not to have sex or with the promiscuous or something and so forth.

499
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:56,760
It's not that they learned to stop being gourmets.

500
00:53:57,401 --> 00:54:00,361
It's, those would be actions.

501
00:54:00,361 --> 00:54:04,361
They've learned to stop desiring promiscuity.

502
00:54:04,361 --> 00:54:09,321
They've learned to stop desiring fancy food, et cetera, et cetera.

503
00:54:09,881 --> 00:54:16,281
They've learned to stop desiring being the best and proud and having people admire them.

504
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:25,480
And when their desires are sufficiently purified, they'll know it when food doesn't look attractive to them anymore, etc.

505
00:54:25,801 --> 00:54:39,560
And then they'll be able to go on up the mountain of purgatory, stopping at the various places where the particular punishment or particular sin that they've got gets punished.

506
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:57,720
By the way, Chiardi's got something wrong in a diagram I want to mention to you simply because the moral is I've now checked and it turns out to be absolutely wrong to, I mean, or anyway, these names of the ledges are not Dante's.

507
00:54:57,721 --> 00:55:00,601
He didn't name the ledges and the punishments.

508
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:07,080
So remember, when way back to my fussing about the opportunists, and I said, those weren't opportunists.

509
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:12,200
Those were people that were the lukewarm, which is very different than opportunists.

510
00:55:12,201 --> 00:55:15,240
And then I worried, but whose name is Opportunist?

511
00:55:15,241 --> 00:55:17,401
And it's Chiardi's.

512
00:55:17,721 --> 00:55:30,160
And so the moral of this is when you think about your papers, if you come out with the feeling that after reading a certain punishment, that it's really not the way it's described by Chiardi, you are right.

513
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,680
You have a complete right to rename that canto.

514
00:55:33,681 --> 00:55:37,841
And here is a place where he renames, well, I want to rename everything.

515
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:42,241
And we'll get back to it, but I may forget, so I want to look at it right now.

516
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:52,641
On page 30, there's no page 30, but if you go back from page 32 to 31, you will get to page 30, is the picture of purgatory.

517
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:58,241
And the top level, Chiardi calls immoderate love.

518
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:02,400
Now, I'm going to say this over and over because it's very important.

519
00:56:02,721 --> 00:56:08,641
There is no immoderate love in Dante's version of the creation.

520
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:15,760
Because total love and devotion is the appropriate relation to God.

521
00:56:16,881 --> 00:56:18,801
So what is the problem?

522
00:56:18,801 --> 00:56:20,960
It's never immoderate love.

523
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,041
It's misdirected love.

524
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:33,120
I mean, the only thing that you could do wrong is to totally adore, totally worship, totally love anything other than God.

525
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,321
And so we don't want to call the top level immoderate love.

526
00:56:38,321 --> 00:56:41,200
You want to call it misdirected love.

527
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,400
And Dante's clear about that.

528
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:44,801
I don't know.

529
00:56:44,881 --> 00:56:49,040
Chiardi's got this problem with trying to...

530
00:56:49,201 --> 00:56:54,001
Chardi's a stoic who wandered into translating this book by mistake, I think.

531
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,921
But where are we now?

532
00:56:55,921 --> 00:57:02,800
Okay, so one more thing, and just to give you the overall picture, that everything is different.

533
00:57:02,801 --> 00:57:07,601
So you don't have to, you aren't reading much of the purgatory, so I have to give you some feel for it, anyway.

534
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:15,960
So instead of this terrible smell, which they had in hell all the time that gets mentioned every once in a while, it's now fragrant and perfumy.

535
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:22,121
Instead of all the howling bad noises from hell, it's now people singing.

536
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:26,681
Instead of blaspheming God, it's now prayer.

537
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:40,521
And in general, instead of darkness, which is the general way it must be in the inferno, mostly only by the fiery walls of the city of Dis, it's the sun shines.

538
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:41,881
I mean, I don't know how the sun shines.

539
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,081
Well, sure, the sun shines, that's right, because they're out here now.

540
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:49,081
And so the sun shines in the daytime.

541
00:57:49,080 --> 00:58:00,680
And the sun, it's important to know, is stands in, so to speak, represents, or I don't know quite how to put it, the attraction of God.

542
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,641
The sun is God in the way it's treated.

543
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:14,760
And so whenever the sun is shining, then you can go toward it, and it's attractive, and it pulls you to get better and better as a person.

544
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:21,720
And at night, it follows from this that at night, when the sun doesn't shine, you can't do anything.

545
00:58:21,721 --> 00:58:25,801
You can't walk from your ledge to the next ledge if you're purified.

546
00:58:25,801 --> 00:58:32,361
You can't even walk upward getting better at what, getting more over your addiction.

547
00:58:32,361 --> 00:58:34,440
You can't do anything at night.

548
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:39,561
Because remember now, all movement comes ultimately from God.

549
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:48,281
Another way to put this is God is the prime mover, because God's attraction is what ultimately moves people.

550
00:58:48,281 --> 00:58:53,121
And if there's no sun, then you're out of the presence of God.

551
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:57,361
Then there's no prime mover, then you can't move.

552
00:58:57,361 --> 00:58:58,960
And that's exactly what happens.

553
00:58:54,761 --> 00:59:00,560
Dante's very consistent.

554
00:59:01,281 --> 00:59:25,201
So, and Virgil can't understand this because he doesn't understand ever, and you've got to keep remembering that, that God is the completely fulfilling something or other that makes it always, you can never love too much, because God is worshipable, adorable, totally lovable, and so forth.

555
00:59:25,201 --> 00:59:31,361
But when the sun isn't shining, then these people can't improve.

556
00:59:31,361 --> 00:59:38,241
This is on Canto 7, line 14.

557
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,480
Well, 14 is just the name of somebody.

558
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:52,001
Sordello's talking, and on page 85, line 40, he's explaining, this guy, Sordello, just what I'm telling you.

559
00:59:52,000 --> 01:00:00,480
He says, we're not fixed in one place, he replied, but roaming at will up and around this slope, far as the gate, and I will be your guide.

560
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:04,881
But the day is fading fast, and in no case may one ascend at night.

561
01:00:04,881 --> 01:00:08,241
We will do well to give some thought to a good resting place.

562
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:14,560
And then, skipping a verse, getting to 49, what is it you say, my guide asked?

563
01:00:14,801 --> 01:00:17,281
He's puzzled, Virgil.

564
01:00:17,281 --> 01:00:26,881
He doesn't understand this whole picture of something utterly fulfilling that's attracting you and making you able to do whatever you do.

565
01:00:26,881 --> 01:00:34,801
He says, if one sought to climb at night, would others block his way, or would he simply find that he could not?

566
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:39,921
And that is really, he's asking, why can't people do things on their own willpower?

567
01:00:40,761 --> 01:00:45,960
And he's getting the answer: you can't do anything really on your own willpower.

568
01:00:45,960 --> 01:01:01,561
It's always what you do, a response to, it's always what you do is in terms of your desires, and your desires are always responses to the attractiveness of the creation, and therefore ultimately responses to the attractiveness of God.

569
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,881
And Virgil can't understand any of that.

570
01:01:03,881 --> 01:01:10,440
He says, Sardello says, once the sun sets, that noble fellow replied, you would not cross this line.

571
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,440
And he ran his finger and so forth.

572
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:23,161
Then skipping to 61, I heard my Lord's voice, that is Virgil, touched with wonder, say, lead me to the place that you spoke of, where we can, in effect, lie down and rest.

573
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:30,761
So the whole principle of why and how they're climbing this mountain is something Virgil can't understand.

574
01:01:30,761 --> 01:01:40,281
And we're beginning to be prepared for what's going to happen when Virgil's understanding really gives out completely.

575
01:01:40,281 --> 01:01:42,921
Virgil's always sort of got it wrong.

576
01:01:42,921 --> 01:01:56,440
Because if he doesn't understand this basic truth, that there is something in the universe that's absolutely fulfilling and adorable, then everything he's going to think is going to be wrong.

577
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:06,280
But it gets clearer and clearer that it's wrong until the middle of the purgatory, which we'll talk about next time, or maybe we'll talk about this time, I'm not sure.

578
01:02:06,281 --> 01:02:07,561
Let me think about it.

579
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:10,440
No, let's do it now, because I'm talking about it.

580
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:18,040
So let's jump to Canto 16, 16 to 18.

581
01:02:18,361 --> 01:02:26,721
That's where Virgil finally explains everything and blows it completely and gets everything all mixed up.

582
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:31,440
And we'll start with it now and I'll review it again at the beginning next time.

583
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:35,921
But it's so, it's all, and I've been sort of preparing you for it.

584
01:02:35,921 --> 01:02:48,241
But on Dante's not much help, because Dante seems very confused at secondhand, so to speak, about what Virgil knows and understands and what Virgil doesn't know and understand.

585
01:02:48,241 --> 01:03:02,000
He was very clear at the wall in hell that what Virgil didn't understand is something called sin or rebellion or whatever that Christians and the Christians understand.

586
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,281
But now we've got him trying to explain everything.

587
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:08,960
It starts on page.

588
01:03:09,281 --> 01:03:11,280
Oh, there's this whole discussion of free will.

589
01:03:11,281 --> 01:03:13,521
I'm going to skip that for the time being.

590
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:16,800
And then Dante's whole discussion of the relation of church and state.

591
01:03:16,801 --> 01:03:18,720
I'm skipping that for the time being.

592
01:03:18,721 --> 01:03:25,440
I want to go directly to Canto 17 and then talk about what's going on.

593
01:03:27,361 --> 01:03:36,081
And now you've got to realize that scholars have only, don't try to read secondary sources about this, because they are all completely hopeless.

594
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:40,241
Because somehow or other they've got the view that you can believe what Virgil says.

595
01:03:40,241 --> 01:03:45,601
And you could see already at the wall that Virgil doesn't understand what it was or why it was important.

596
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:52,001
And now Virgil's explaining the whole structure of purgatory and of God and of love and everything.

597
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,601
And he's all mixed up.

598
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:58,081
And if you go to find any help from the critics, you're not, because they're all mixed up.

599
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:04,081
And I can't fix it, but I can show you what he's trying to say and how it's mixed up.

600
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:07,681
And also, maybe give you an account of why it's mixed up.

601
01:04:07,681 --> 01:04:09,121
Okay, let's see now.

602
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:26,361
So here we are in the middle of purgatory, and what you're getting is some kind of mixture of Aristotle and Troubadour Christianity, somehow put together to try to explain everything that's going on.

603
01:04:26,361 --> 01:04:30,681
I mean, what I really think is there's no coherent way to put it together.

604
01:04:30,681 --> 01:04:46,921
It's not Dante's fault that you can't get Troubadour love of your lady together with Aristotle and Stoic views about desire and views about the total blissfulness of contemplating the supreme being.

605
01:04:46,921 --> 01:04:50,681
There are just too many balls in the air to keep track of.

606
01:04:51,241 --> 01:05:05,240
What I sort of reproach Dante for is that he doesn't signal the fact that Virgil is all mixed up until by the time he does, I'll try to show you that he does, but by that time we're all mixed up.

607
01:05:05,241 --> 01:05:07,000
So here's what the best I can do.

608
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:18,520
So we discover you can't move at night, but after the sun goes down, you discover that different stars come out, starting on 181.

609
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:25,001
We're now in Canto 17, line 70, roughly.

610
01:05:25,881 --> 01:05:30,120
And then now they discover they can't walk anymore.

611
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,881
Our strength, why do you melt away?

612
01:05:31,881 --> 01:05:33,080
I said several times.

613
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:36,281
They're in a different place than they were the previous night, I think, but doesn't matter.

614
01:05:36,281 --> 01:05:37,401
It's night again.

615
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:48,520
And my legs were turning to lead, and they've gotten to a certain style and as a certain level.

616
01:05:48,521 --> 01:05:59,600
And now he asks Virgil, line 82, Dear Father, what impurity is washed in pain here, though our feet must stay, I beg you not to stay your speech.

617
01:05:59,601 --> 01:06:04,320
And he, and now he starts a big speech about how things are.

618
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:11,921
They happen to be in the circle of sloth, which we'll come back to, but that's not what he's explaining right now.

619
01:06:11,921 --> 01:06:21,841
He says, and he says, now at line 85, that love of good which in life before lay idle in the soul is paid for now.

620
01:06:21,841 --> 01:06:24,561
Here, sloth strains at the once neglected oral.

621
01:06:24,641 --> 01:06:33,360
He's already telling you, sloth is sort of being too lazy, not, again, not passionate about anything, not caring enough about anything.

622
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:43,520
But that you may more clearly know the way which your entire attention, give your entire attention to my words, and you shall gather good fruit from delay.

623
01:06:43,521 --> 01:06:47,440
We'll use this time we can't walk for Virgil to explain things.

624
01:06:47,441 --> 01:06:49,040
Now comes confusion.

625
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:52,160
He says, neither creator nor his creatures.

626
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,960
Now, what is he knowing about creator and creatures?

627
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,520
He's supposed to be talking from antiquity.

628
01:06:57,521 --> 01:06:59,360
I've looked it up in the Italian.

629
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:00,881
That's what it says.

630
01:07:00,881 --> 01:07:02,080
I don't know.

631
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,960
I mean, it looks like, I don't know what it looks like.

632
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:12,080
It looks like Dante's can't get it, can't keep clear track of what Virgil can know and what he can't know.

633
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:14,240
And you'll see it happening again in a minute.

634
01:07:14,561 --> 01:07:21,761
He says, neither creature nor creator move as you well know, but in the action of animal or mind-directed love.

635
01:07:21,761 --> 01:07:28,640
Now that's funny, because he didn't know a little while before that you had to be in the sun in order to move.

636
01:07:28,641 --> 01:07:38,960
Now he says it's perfectly obvious as if, well, either he just learned it, which I don't think, or that anybody knows that you don't move except insofar as you love.

637
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:43,000
Now then it becomes three stanzas of total confusion, I think.

638
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:51,080
Natural love may never fall to error, the other may strive to good or bad ends by too little or too much fervor.

639
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:56,680
Now, I don't know, that sounds like a story about misdirected love.

640
01:07:56,681 --> 01:08:01,801
And that's nice, except that's not an Aristotelian Virgil sort of thing.

641
01:08:01,801 --> 01:08:03,160
And then it gets even weirder.

642
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:08,360
While it desires the eternal good, I don't even know if I should put you through this.

643
01:08:08,921 --> 01:08:13,640
Don't get upset and don't try to understand it, because it doesn't, it's all confused.

644
01:08:13,641 --> 01:08:19,721
The primal good is, or the eternal good is Aristotle's prime mover.

645
01:08:19,721 --> 01:08:23,400
There is a kind of God-like something in Aristotle.

646
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:32,200
It's just not the God of the Christians, and it's not a God that you love, but it is somehow the mover of everything.

647
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:35,080
And then you should love secondary goods in reason.

648
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:45,400
Well, Virgil is talking mostly Christian-like, only sort of mapping it sort of into sort of semi-Aristotle talk.

649
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:46,761
Oh, dear, I don't know.

650
01:08:46,761 --> 01:08:52,520
I shouldn't have even tried, but I'm going to read you one more paragraph, and then I'm going to say I don't know what to make of it.

651
01:08:52,521 --> 01:08:59,720
But when it turns to evil or shows more or less zeal in it aught for what is good, the creature turns on the Creator.

652
01:08:59,721 --> 01:09:04,040
You realize how all wrong that is for those three stanzas?

653
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:07,480
That's not Virgil's and Aristotle's view.

654
01:09:07,481 --> 01:09:08,681
That's the Christian view.

655
01:09:08,681 --> 01:09:20,761
I've just been telling you, that you can love some things too much and some things too little, that you desire the primal good, and the creature can turn on the Creator.

656
01:09:20,761 --> 01:09:23,881
But he didn't understand how the creature could turn on the Creator.

657
01:09:23,881 --> 01:09:25,520
That was what was happening at the wall.

658
01:09:25,841 --> 01:09:34,480
So Virgil launches into this seemingly Christian story, and I don't get it.

659
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:48,640
And then he says, on the top of 182, line 110, and since no being may exist alone and apart from the first being, whatever that is, by their nature, all beings lack the power to hate that one.

660
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:56,640
Well, now he seems to think that now he's being like Virgil, sort of, because he doesn't understand the wall.

661
01:09:56,641 --> 01:09:58,480
He doesn't understand sin.

662
01:09:58,481 --> 01:10:06,240
He now has flipped over to the view that since God is desirable and fulfilling, no one could hate God.

663
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:10,080
So now he's missing his story about sin.

664
01:10:10,561 --> 01:10:12,000
I shouldn't have launched into this.

665
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,921
Let me go to the punchline.

666
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:16,960
Where does he get things wrong?

667
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,400
I've got three minutes.

668
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,160
Go to page 190.

669
01:10:20,481 --> 01:10:27,680
The final important thing for him is that you have the power to control your love.

670
01:10:27,681 --> 01:10:32,400
And that means to, let's go back to the bottom of 189.

671
01:10:32,721 --> 01:10:36,160
The crucial thing is in line 63.

672
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:46,000
That is, what you just take line 63, that you, because you have reason, you can guard the threshold of consent.

673
01:10:46,320 --> 01:11:06,320
That Virgil thinks that since nothing in the world is really worthy of total love, your job to be a good person is to cut down your love to equal the relative lovableness of things.

674
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:15,240
But being a Stoic, he thinks that the most important thing you've got is the willpower not to totally love anything.

675
01:11:15,881 --> 01:11:16,601
And that's right.

676
01:11:16,841 --> 01:11:18,520
Here Virgil is being consistent.

677
01:11:18,521 --> 01:11:39,400
I mean, he's being wrong in explaining the divine comedy, but he's consistent with his Stoic view that the highest thing you've got is the power not to go and adore anything, because nothing is worthy of total love and adoration.

678
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,480
That's sort of the sadness of Virgil.

679
01:11:41,481 --> 01:11:43,801
That's why Virgil is in limbo.

680
01:11:43,801 --> 01:11:48,040
Now, one, I got, according to that clock, one minute.

681
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:56,440
I said at the very end, Dante lets you in on the fact that at that point Virgil has gone wrong.

682
01:11:56,441 --> 01:11:58,360
And how does he let you in on it?

683
01:11:58,761 --> 01:12:04,280
Well, he says he was listening to Virgil, and what did he do listening to Virgil?

684
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:08,280
He said he found himself falling to sleep, line 87.

685
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:14,520
So since Virgil had answered my question so clearly, is he being ironic?

686
01:12:14,521 --> 01:12:15,560
I think so.

687
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:20,921
My mind was rambling, I was rambling drowsy within my mind.

688
01:12:20,921 --> 01:12:27,801
So the first thing is, when somebody gives a good lecture, explaining things clearly, you don't go to sleep.

689
01:12:27,801 --> 01:12:32,680
I don't see anybody asleep here today, at least, happily.

690
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:40,520
But if you do give a confused and over-the-head of and bad lecture, then people start to go to sleep.

691
01:12:40,521 --> 01:12:41,560
That's the first thing.

692
01:12:41,561 --> 01:12:45,400
Dante hears this whole story, and his response is to fall asleep.

693
01:12:45,400 --> 01:13:00,000
Secondly, it turns out that since they're on the level of sloth, the people who are always being done given the opposite of what they had before, these people who didn't love enough, are being made to be frantically energetic.

694
01:12:54,521 --> 01:13:01,360
So he was awakened.

695
01:13:01,601 --> 01:13:08,320
Now I'm 89, I'm going to stop, in an instant to a pack of people running towards us, a mob, they broke upon the mountain.

696
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,480
And what are they saying in line 103?

697
01:13:10,481 --> 01:13:14,240
Faster, faster to be slow in love is to lose time.

698
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:21,600
So Virgil is talking on the circle of sloth because he is a case of sloth, because he's slow in love.

699
01:13:21,601 --> 01:13:31,680
Because instead of saying you should soup up your love and direct it toward God, he's saying you should control your love and cut it down to how satisfying the world is.

700
01:13:31,681 --> 01:13:35,120
And there Virgil has gone completely wrong.

701
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,600
At least it gets clear there.

702
01:13:37,601 --> 01:13:44,000
There's a while I don't understand it, but there I think you can see Dante repudiating Virgil's view.

703
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,520
Okay, stop at that.
