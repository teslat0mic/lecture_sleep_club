1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,161
The culture is a complete mess.

2
00:00:03,521 --> 00:00:13,281
It's all turned out at the end of the libation bearers that Apollo and the Furies just can't stand each other.

3
00:00:13,281 --> 00:00:15,521
They can't understand each other.

4
00:00:15,521 --> 00:00:20,800
They find each other dangerous and disgusting and upsetting and so forth.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:39,120
And at the most abstract level, Apollo can't stand the Furies' partiality, that they are loyal, they care about families and blood ties, but they don't, for instance, care about husbands and being rational about things.

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,920
Apollo can't stand that.

7
00:00:42,721 --> 00:00:51,200
And that comes out when he says at the top of 143, we're just at the end of the, we're just at the beginning of the humanities now.

8
00:00:51,201 --> 00:01:01,440
I see that one, that is one kind of murder, cause one cause moves you to strong rage, but on the other, clearly, you are unmoved to act.

9
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:04,561
That's just not the way rationality should work.

10
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,680
It should be impartial.

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,040
It should be universal.

12
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,800
If you define what a murder is, then every murder should bother you.

13
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:19,040
It shouldn't be a question of whether the person murdered was murdered under the aspect father or king or human being or what.

14
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,200
And family loyalty is irrational.

15
00:01:23,201 --> 00:01:26,081
You should be loyal to everybody or nobody.

16
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:28,480
There's nothing special about the family.

17
00:01:29,441 --> 00:01:35,681
As he says on 157, I've read this before, but it's the clearest statement of what he stands for.

18
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:45,240
Remember, he says, Never for man, woman, nor city, for my throne of prophecy have I spoken a word except that Father Zeus of the Olympians might command.

19
00:01:41,441 --> 00:01:46,521
This is justice.

20
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:53,320
Well, that's an oblique way of saying, I treat everybody, man, woman, and city, equally.

21
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,680
That's rational.

22
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,281
That's justice.

23
00:01:56,601 --> 00:02:05,240
And the Furies don't claim to be just and impartial, but they do claim to be consistent.

24
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:14,601
That is, they claim that they've got a certain job, which is to revenge blood relatives, and they do it always.

25
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,560
So you can count on them, and they keep order.

26
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,081
It doesn't matter whether they're rationally consistent.

27
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:27,401
And you see that on page where, well, really all through it.

28
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:41,321
I don't think I have a quote where they say they're consistent, but they're always saying we know what our job is, and they want to say, and don't try to undermine our sense of our job by giving us rational arguments.

29
00:02:41,321 --> 00:02:43,641
They say that at the middle of 143.

30
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,601
Do not try to dock my privilege by argument.

31
00:02:46,601 --> 00:02:58,281
Now that sort of shows the situation has become completely desperate because it isn't as if they all share some sense of what a good argument is so that they can have an argument.

32
00:02:58,281 --> 00:03:05,161
So maybe one side can win or the other side can win or they can at least, or maybe they can see that there's arguments on both sides.

33
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,521
But it's worse than that.

34
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:11,241
Apollo thinks that the last recourse is arguments.

35
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:17,081
And if you have the winning, convincing, rational argument, then everybody ought to do what that says.

36
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:23,001
And the Furies thing, the last final convincing thing is feelings, is emotions.

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,921
And it doesn't matter what the arguments are, it's how you feel that finally matters.

38
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:32,801
Now, that might sound strange and primitive and distanced to you, but it's not.

39
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:35,601
I'll give you two examples of where it's not.

40
00:03:35,601 --> 00:03:37,921
One is sort of really close to home.

41
00:03:37,921 --> 00:03:55,681
Haven't you ever been in an argument with your partner, somebody you care about, or your sibling, or something, where clearly you have done, you've given good arguments for doing things your way or showing that you are right, and the other person says, I don't care what your arguments are.

42
00:03:55,681 --> 00:04:00,081
I have a feeling that I've been mistreated, or I have a feeling that that's the wrong thing to do.

43
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:04,801
And that's still the Fury way of thinking.

44
00:04:04,801 --> 00:04:34,401
Back before your time in the days of the Vietnam War, this was very, very important and clear that people didn't care whether arguments, one way or the other, they felt that the Vietnam War was wrong, the people who were against it, which were most of the students, so that, and this is the important thing, they felt that they could boycott and shout down and shut up any speaker who came to campus to try to give arguments why we should be in the Vietnam War.

45
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,801
They wouldn't listen because they said it doesn't matter what he says, it doesn't matter whether it's even convincing what he says.

46
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:44,081
We feel this is wrong and we're against this war.

47
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:47,601
And that's the way the Furies feel about Apollo.

48
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:52,240
And when you get to that kind of standoff, the situation looks hopeless.

49
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,761
And that's where we are.

50
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,920
The situation certainly looks hopeless.

51
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,001
And we're on 143.

52
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,160
And on 143, Athena comes onto the scene.

53
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,081
Well, no, she hasn't yet.

54
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:06,561
When they're in Athens, they're at the Acropolis.

55
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:12,360
They're at the temple and statue of Athena, and Orestes enters the scene.

56
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:23,241
And that's where we are, because that's all discussion and argument and respect and understanding has broken down, and it looks like there's no way out.

57
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:42,201
And so we, and now it turns out, so we switch to Athena at the Acropolis, and the furies that were up to now, the furies of Clytemnestra, become the Furies in general.

58
00:05:42,201 --> 00:05:43,801
That's important to realize.

59
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:48,441
So, two things have happened that will confuse you if you don't realize it.

60
00:05:48,441 --> 00:06:03,721
One, these furies are now on stage, as I said last time, because they're not psychological hallucinations as they were for Orestes at the end of the libation bearers.

61
00:06:03,721 --> 00:06:05,480
They're cultural forces.

62
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,240
They're real forces.

63
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:17,401
I don't think Aeschylus and his contemporaries believed that there were these ugly, oozy, snaky ladies running around at all.

64
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:25,241
But he's putting on stage certain forces of revenge and emotion and so forth.

65
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,961
And he's putting on stage Apollo.

66
00:06:27,961 --> 00:06:30,041
I don't think for a minute they anymore believe.

67
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,961
This is 500 years after the Odyssey.

68
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:43,401
And the Odyssey was already written down after the Homeric time that it was reporting on, which may have made it 700 years before.

69
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,721
And they're getting very rational.

70
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:47,560
That's what's upsetting the Fury so much.

71
00:06:47,561 --> 00:06:49,401
The culture is getting rational.

72
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:57,921
And the culture, so Apollo represents the rationality, which is now an important part of their thinking.

73
00:06:58,561 --> 00:07:07,201
And so there they are coming together in the Acropolis.

74
00:07:07,201 --> 00:07:24,480
And the Furies who are up to now the Furies of Clytemnestra are the Furies in general, as the force in the culture that drives people to revenge, that gets them all emotionally upset when anybody kills a blood relative.

75
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:31,201
And Orestes, and that's my next point, has gotten over being upset.

76
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:40,641
Remember last time I said that what put the Furies to sleep, remember they're, was it the last time or right at the beginning of this one?

77
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:44,241
Right at the beginning of this one, of the humanities.

78
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,000
The Furies were asleep, and what put the Furies to sleep was simply time.

79
00:07:50,321 --> 00:07:54,801
And they got tired chasing Orestes all over.

80
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,160
And they got so tired, they just went to sleep.

81
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,120
And Orestes doesn't feel guilty anymore.

82
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,641
That's the important thing.

83
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:08,321
I wanted to point out two things, by the way, in 137 while I'm back there.

84
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:16,321
I think I may have forgotten to say something which contradicts, which seems to contradict what I just said.

85
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:20,961
If I'm right, what puts the Furies to sleep is simply time.

86
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,361
And it better be like that.

87
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:31,201
Because they're the emotions of guilt, the feelings of guilt, the feelings of revenge, the outrage.

88
00:08:31,201 --> 00:08:32,640
They're the feelings of outrage.

89
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,841
And you can't go around feeling outraged for years and years and years.

90
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:37,441
At least most people can.

91
00:08:37,441 --> 00:08:41,360
And so the furies wear out, lose their force.

92
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,121
In the case of Orestes, he gets over his guilt feelings.

93
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,440
But there's a line that seems to contradict this.

94
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:54,121
This is the reason why you've got to have a copy in the philosophy library.

95
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:57,561
Apollo comes on the stage contradicting me.

96
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:08,041
On page 137, line 65, he says, See now how I have caught and overpowered these lewd creatures.

97
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,521
What's he doing overpowering them?

98
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,520
They don't need anybody to overpower them.

99
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,721
They just run down.

100
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:19,961
That's how emotion, if Apollo's not in the business of overpowering emotions, what would he use to overpower emotions?

101
00:09:19,961 --> 00:09:22,841
Every time he tries to deal with them, they just get more upset.

102
00:09:22,841 --> 00:09:29,081
Well, the translation says, see how these lewd creatures have fallen asleep, which is fine.

103
00:09:29,081 --> 00:09:30,281
He can say that.

104
00:09:30,281 --> 00:09:35,001
I don't know why the translator wants to give him anything else to say.

105
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:48,201
And the other thing I wanted to point out that I think I didn't point out on 137 was the mention on line 79, never fail until you come at last to Pallas Citadel.

106
00:09:48,201 --> 00:09:50,441
That Pallas is Athena.

107
00:09:50,441 --> 00:09:52,601
She's sometimes called Pallas Athena.

108
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:53,801
I don't know what it means.

109
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm not sure it means anything.

110
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:56,840
I've never seen it explained.

111
00:09:56,841 --> 00:09:59,801
But anyway, you just need constantly to get the code.

112
00:09:59,801 --> 00:10:06,281
Whenever you s you hear about Pallas, P-A-L-L-A-S, that's Athena.

113
00:10:06,281 --> 00:10:13,880
And now I'm going back to where I was, which is so Orestes has gotten over being upset.

114
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,601
We're now on page 145.

115
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:26,601
And he says it in various ways, but and he's gone through a lot of absolution rituals.

116
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:34,321
I mean, I don't know what they are, really, but whatever they are, they sort of take away his guilt feelings.

117
00:10:34,321 --> 00:10:38,081
They're not expiation punishments.

118
00:10:38,081 --> 00:10:44,001
Expiation is what you do when you're convicted of a crime and you have to go to prison.

119
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,441
Or, as I keep mentioning, all of you, most of you, I asked you this before, I think, how many of you read crime and punishment?

120
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,961
A whole lot, as I recall.

121
00:10:50,961 --> 00:11:09,521
Well, remember, Raskolnikov has to go to Siberia, not to get over feeling guilty for killing the old lady, but to do his, to pay his debt to society for having expiating his guilt.

122
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:14,321
But Orestes doesn't have any guilt, he claims, and Apollo claims.

123
00:11:14,321 --> 00:11:19,761
So he doesn't have to expiate his guilt, but he does have guilt feelings.

124
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,721
And the word for what he has to do is somehow feel absolved.

125
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:34,160
That is, feel okay about the fact that he slit his mother's throat, which is not easy to do and not easy to feel good about.

126
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,480
But he's supposed to, and he finally does.

127
00:11:36,481 --> 00:11:38,960
And he's talking about that on 145.

128
00:11:38,961 --> 00:11:41,281
Orestes says, I've been beaten and been taught.

129
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:45,920
I understand the rules of absolution, where it is right to speak and where it's silent.

130
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,480
It is this action now.

131
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:58,640
In this action now, speech has been ordered by my teacher, that is Apollo, who I said, but his name Luxius means speech like logos.

132
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,120
Somebody sent me an email when it's podcast.

133
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,400
You never know from where.

134
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:13,240
I think this one was from Algeria or someplace, telling me that it's not true that Luxius does not mean logic in speaking.

135
00:12:13,561 --> 00:12:19,160
And now I don't know, so I ordered the book that this email told me to order.

136
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:25,480
I'm going to stick to think hoping that Luxius means speech because that's what Apollo is good at.

137
00:12:25,481 --> 00:12:28,760
And logos is the word for speech.

138
00:12:29,241 --> 00:12:30,120
So let's go on.

139
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,041
He says, anyway, where are we?

140
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:38,920
Okay, he knows when to speak and when not, as Apollo has taught him, his teacher has taught him, who is wise.

141
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,321
The stain of blood dulls now and fades upon my hand.

142
00:12:43,321 --> 00:12:46,120
My blood of macricide is being washed away.

143
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:54,040
See, that's not, I've done the time in Siberia or prison for my crime.

144
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,920
It's that I'm getting over being so upset.

145
00:12:57,241 --> 00:13:03,880
And a little skipping down in case you're not convinced yet, time in his aging overtakes all things alike.

146
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:10,440
Now from pure mouth and with good auspices, I call upon Athena, queen of this land, to come and rescue me.

147
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,920
That's pretty clear.

148
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:19,880
And now the question is: nothing's going to happen for a while to Orestes.

149
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,360
And in the end, nothing important does happen now to Orestes.

150
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,801
He's just a test case, and he just gets dropped and disappears from the action, as you know.

151
00:13:29,801 --> 00:13:33,081
By the end of it, nobody's paying any attention to Orestes at all.

152
00:13:33,081 --> 00:13:38,120
I think he leaves, but I'd have to go back and look if he leaves or just stands around.

153
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:53,321
But in any case, what's important is that it's now that he's gotten over being upset, we have to understand what the furies think about what's going on.

154
00:13:53,321 --> 00:13:56,601
And of course, they are, again, always furious.

155
00:13:57,041 --> 00:14:13,440
So in 146, they're starting to go into a kind of rant about what the rules are from their point of view, how they feel about it, to put it better, and how they feel about it is Orestes should be still upset.

156
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:22,960
And Clytemnestra sort of goes and yells at them at the beginning to wake them up and tell them, don't let yourself get calmed down.

157
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,081
Be upset.

158
00:14:24,081 --> 00:14:30,561
So here they are stating again why they're upset on 146, line 311.

159
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
We hold we are straight and just.

160
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,640
Remember, they all think they're just.

161
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,601
If a man can spread his hands and show they are clean, no wrath of ours shall lurk for him.

162
00:14:39,601 --> 00:14:42,400
Unscathed, he walks through his lifetime.

163
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:58,880
But one like this man before us with stained, hidden hands and the guilt upon him shall find us beside him as witnesses of the truth, and we show clear in the end, and we show clear in the end to avenge the blood of the murdered.

164
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,040
Well, that's their repeating their job.

165
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:07,680
And they say more at the bottom.

166
00:15:08,321 --> 00:15:25,280
Mother, oh mother night, remember they're always in the dark, who gave me birth to be a vengeance on the seeing and the blind, hear me, for Leto's youngling, that's Apollo, Leto's his mother, takes my right away.

167
00:15:25,281 --> 00:15:25,681
What?

168
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,520
Zeus, I guess?

169
00:15:27,521 --> 00:15:28,081
Possible.

170
00:15:28,081 --> 00:15:29,120
Zeus is his father.

171
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,480
Leto's his mother.

172
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:38,880
I didn't think half people who are only half gods got into the pantheon, or people, I mean, entities, creatures, whatever they are.

173
00:15:39,841 --> 00:15:43,480
Is he the only one who's got a human mother in the pantheon?

174
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,960
Oh, Leto's another is a demigod or one of.

175
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,281
Okay, I suppose that's right.

176
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:59,081
I never could get clear how this works with demigods and who are, I think, half human, half gods.

177
00:15:59,081 --> 00:16:00,440
Anyway, this is Apollo.

178
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,280
I shouldn't have even asked.

179
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:10,841
So Leto's youngling takes my right away, steals from my clutch the prey that crouches, whose blood would wipe at last the mother's blood away.

180
00:16:10,841 --> 00:16:13,321
And they don't want that.

181
00:16:13,321 --> 00:16:25,960
But now the question is, and this is very important for understanding something later in the play, which really seems sort of implausible and very important and very hard to understand.

182
00:16:26,281 --> 00:16:27,960
And now I have to set it up.

183
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:42,601
What I want to show you is that the Furies haven't always been so stern and harsh and outraged as they are at this stage in the culture.

184
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:45,721
And that they've got a special gripe.

185
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,521
They weren't so upsetting at the time of Homer.

186
00:16:48,521 --> 00:16:51,160
Of course, Homer didn't pay much attention to them either.

187
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:58,040
And to put it in a simple way, what's upsetting them is that Homer didn't pay any attention to them.

188
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:02,440
That is, they are losing their place in the culture.

189
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,400
People aren't taking them seriously.

190
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:11,640
Or people are repressing and controlling their emotions in the name of being rational.

191
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,280
And they are upset because they're being repressed.

192
00:17:16,281 --> 00:17:21,801
You've got to see that Aeschylus are slipping this in all the time for reasons we'll get to.

193
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:25,960
But here you can see him starting to worry about that.

194
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,841
If you start in the middle of 147, the Furies are still ranting on.

195
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,440
They haven't reached their ultimate ranting, which I'll show you later.

196
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:45,920
I have chosen overthrow of houses where the battle god growing within strikes near and dear down, and so we swoop on this land, on this man, while the blood is still wet on him.

197
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,920
And now comes the important thing.

198
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,960
Here we stand in our haste to wrench from all others these devisings.

199
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:59,601
Make the gods clear of our counsels, so that even appeal comes not to them.

200
00:17:59,601 --> 00:18:00,240
What?

201
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:01,920
Here was there and he's doing.

202
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:08,960
And they're trying to get the gods to pay attention to them because the appeal doesn't get to the new gods.

203
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:20,081
Since the appeal comes not to them, since Zeus, who's now here a new god, a pantheon god, has ruled our blood-dripping company outcast, nor will deal with us.

204
00:18:20,081 --> 00:18:21,520
That's crucial.

205
00:18:21,521 --> 00:18:43,280
So the coming in of the power of the pantheon, which is really Homer's doing, has pushed these other, more ancient, more primitive impulses into the margins, into the dark, and as repressed and in the dark, they get worse.

206
00:18:43,281 --> 00:18:47,841
I mean, Aeschylus is having a kind of Freudian intuition about all this.

207
00:18:47,841 --> 00:18:51,440
That only on a cultural level, not on an individual level.

208
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:58,960
And in Freud, what you repress gets more and more out of control and sort of dangerous to you.

209
00:18:58,961 --> 00:19:06,321
Well, in a culture, what it impresses gets more and more out of control and dangerous to the culture, Aeschylus thinks.

210
00:19:06,321 --> 00:19:09,360
And that's what they're complaining about.

211
00:19:10,481 --> 00:19:15,160
Of course, Homer didn't completely write them out of the culture because they're still around very upset.

212
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:20,681
But he tried to marginal them, to marginalize them, and he did, and subordinate them.

213
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:26,120
So as I said last time after looking it up, there are only five references to the Furies in the Odyssey.

214
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:31,321
Therefore, he certainly knows the Furies are around, Homer does, and he doesn't care.

215
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:33,561
And boy, do they resent it.

216
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,321
Homer does have a place.

217
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,081
This is also interesting and important.

218
00:19:41,081 --> 00:19:48,760
All of these things are setting up sort of why things are going to get going to be able to come out all right in the end.

219
00:19:49,081 --> 00:20:09,481
If there was no place in the Homeric practices that have come down and dominated the Greeks, taking, sort of pushing the emotions, the Furies to the side, if there was no understanding of the emotion in the Furies, there would be no way to ever get these things reconciled.

220
00:20:09,481 --> 00:20:19,480
So there better be, somewhere in the Pantheon, somebody who has some marginal sense, anyway, of the importance of the emotions.

221
00:20:19,481 --> 00:20:21,000
And there is.

222
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:28,841
And you will soon you know already if you've been doing the reading that we will soon know who it is, and it's no surprise who it is.

223
00:20:28,841 --> 00:20:40,120
But first I just wanted to say that I think that there that the primitive family emotions that the Furies represent are in the Odyssey.

224
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,680
They're not called the Furies.

225
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:57,280
What where do you find sort of family loyalty trumping all other forms of of reason and all the sort of rules of the new gods?

226
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,761
Yeah?

227
00:20:59,281 --> 00:21:00,241
Absolutely.

228
00:21:00,241 --> 00:21:01,041
Good for you.

229
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,081
I thought that was too hard.

230
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,640
It was only a rhetorical question.

231
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:15,680
Yes, here you've got Poseidon, his son, the Cyclops, is eating Odysseus' troops for breakfast.

232
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:21,040
And this is upsetting to the rest of the pantheon of new gods.

233
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,961
But Poseidon isn't upset.

234
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,000
He's loyal.

235
00:21:24,001 --> 00:21:32,721
He doesn't care what bad things, from the point of view of the new gods, Polyphemus, the Cyclops is doing, eating his guests for breakfast.

236
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:43,200
I mean, how outrageous can it get to a new bunch of gods for whom treating guests well and not hurting them is what Zeus is in charge of.

237
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,481
But there it is.

238
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,241
He only cares that his son has been hurt, blinded.

239
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,920
And so he gets furious at Odysseus.

240
00:21:51,920 --> 00:22:02,640
And through the rest of the book, every time Odysseus is out at sea, he's at terrible risk, and some big storm whooshes up and destroys his raft or his boat or whatever.

241
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,680
Poseidon is always after him.

242
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:15,841
Poseidon even persecutes the Phaeacians, remember, for being nice to them and takes away their harbor at the end of that episode.

243
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:20,720
So for him, these primitive emotions still have their place.

244
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,321
And how then do the other gods react to it?

245
00:22:24,321 --> 00:22:26,561
Well, that's really interesting, I think.

246
00:22:28,321 --> 00:22:34,400
How do you put together the fact that they are in general very tolerant?

247
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,761
And I was stressing that.

248
00:22:35,761 --> 00:22:47,561
Polytheism has a place for all sorts of different emotions and reactions from erotic love to aggression to craftsmanship.

249
00:22:47,561 --> 00:22:48,920
We've gone through all that.

250
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:54,841
How do they deal with this way that Poseidon behaves?

251
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:59,400
Well, they let Poseidon do it.

252
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,601
Even his primitive emotions are allowed a place.

253
00:23:02,601 --> 00:23:13,801
They don't try to completely eradicate or eliminate or overpower or castrate or do whatever they've done among themselves before.

254
00:23:13,801 --> 00:23:26,040
They let Poseidon do it, and nobody puts him down, not even the Phaeacians, who say that they have dinner with the Cyclopses.

255
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:29,721
But they do, on the other hand, sort of marginalize him.

256
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,000
It's very interesting.

257
00:23:31,001 --> 00:23:39,321
What they do is try to do things behind his back that he wouldn't like, like help Odysseus.

258
00:23:39,321 --> 00:23:42,200
So they go around helping out Odysseus.

259
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,481
I guess that's when did he, what do they do while he's off in Ethiopia?

260
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,920
They wait till he's away and they do something that he wouldn't like.

261
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,880
Anyone remember?

262
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,480
I don't remember.

263
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:54,040
Sure, one of you does.

264
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,841
Okay, well, anyway, you can keep an eye open.

265
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:02,120
They say when he's off in Ethiopia, they say, well, now's a good time.

266
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:08,040
If Poseidon isn't around, I think it's just we can help out Odyssey and talk about how to help him out.

267
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:18,680
And I take that to mean that they want, they do things that marginalize his kind of brute family loyalty.

268
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,120
They don't condemn him.

269
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,760
They give him a place in the pantheon.

270
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:25,000
But they are uneasy about it.

271
00:24:25,001 --> 00:24:28,801
And they try to do business when he's not around.

272
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:40,720
So they have a certain kind of tolerance for this cultural primitive world with its own values.

273
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,360
They don't reject it, and they don't integrate it and respect it either.

274
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,561
It's a very funny, tenuous relation.

275
00:24:48,561 --> 00:24:57,440
But it's important to have it around that tenuous relation because that's what's going to make them able to understand the furies at all.

276
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,680
So let's go back to that now.

277
00:25:01,281 --> 00:25:08,960
So Homer, though it's funny, it's in his Odyssey that has a tendency to get rid of the Furies.

278
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,360
There's complicated things going on that nobody talks about because nobody knows about them.

279
00:25:13,601 --> 00:25:18,561
They're happening, so to speak, in the culture, but they're invisible to the people in the culture.

280
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:20,321
Homer's conflicted about it.

281
00:25:20,321 --> 00:25:30,321
He tells the story, presumably from old times, about how Polythemus is, I mean, how Poseidon is not.

282
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,520
Thanks.

283
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:45,200
So Homer, so Homer's both sort of telling us that Poseidon is marginalized and he's also marginalizing the Furies.

284
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:53,040
And it's all sort of, I think it all works, it all is coherent, but it's very annoying to the Furies.

285
00:25:53,041 --> 00:26:02,481
That is, and again, if the cultural practices are marginalizing emotions, then those emotions are going to be upset emotions.

286
00:26:02,481 --> 00:26:08,561
It's a funny idea, but it's definitely Aeschylus' way of thinking about it.

287
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:09,920
Let's see now.

288
00:26:10,081 --> 00:26:19,880
And the crucial thing is that they become harsh and gloomy because they are being marginalized.

289
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,960
And this is on 148.

290
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,280
Let's start in the middle.

291
00:26:24,601 --> 00:26:29,640
For we are strong and skilled, we have authority, we hold memory of evil, we are stern.

292
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,760
That's this, what I'm calling harsh and tough.

293
00:26:32,761 --> 00:26:35,240
Nor can men's pleadings bend us.

294
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:38,681
We drive through our duties, and now they're complaining again.

295
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:44,360
Spurned, outcast from the gods, driven apart to stand in light, not of sun.

296
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:52,200
So it turns out they feel that they have been, they're the one, it wasn't their idea to go underground and into the dark.

297
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,480
They got repressed into the ground and into the dark.

298
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,960
That's part of what they're angry about.

299
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,120
They stand in light, not of sun.

300
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,760
That makes me want to read the translation.

301
00:27:02,761 --> 00:27:05,400
I want to say they're just playing in the dark.

302
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,640
Maybe there's something going on there.

303
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,680
Let's look.

304
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,760
Okay, we'll see what comes out here.

305
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,200
I'll read it all.

306
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:20,120
We are mindful of evil wrought, awful, that's interesting.

307
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,721
Awful and inexorable to mankind.

308
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,321
That's stronger than stern.

309
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:26,521
That fits what I want.

310
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:29,560
They become so angry, so outraged.

311
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:41,081
So, awful and inexorable to mankind, pursuing our appointed office, dishonored, despised, separated from the gods by a light not of the sun.

312
00:27:41,081 --> 00:27:43,081
It's equally incomprehensible.

313
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:47,960
An office which maketh rough the path of the living and the dead alike.

314
00:27:48,281 --> 00:27:49,400
I don't understand.

315
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,160
Separated from the gods by a light, not of the sun.

316
00:27:53,481 --> 00:27:57,440
Seems to me to be a very complicated way of saying we're in the dark.

317
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,200
I'm not sure.

318
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,400
I really can't figure it out.

319
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,841
So let's go on.

320
00:28:04,801 --> 00:28:06,000
Where are we?

321
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:22,880
What's so they're complaining about being repressed, and they say at the end, privilege, now down to 395, roughly, privilege primeval is mine, nor am I without a place, although it be underneath the ground, and in no sunlight, and in gloom.

322
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,960
You see, that's what I wanted to hear.

323
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,120
Oh, dear, now I have to go back and see how the gloom works into it.

324
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,801
I want to put them in the dark.

325
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,401
And I want to say they don't like being in the dark, but nobody asks them.

326
00:28:36,401 --> 00:28:38,640
You just got to keep this sort of Freudian sense.

327
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,521
You repress your emotions, and bad things happen to your emotions.

328
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:46,561
385, is that where 395?

329
00:28:46,881 --> 00:28:48,481
Okay, here we are.

330
00:28:49,760 --> 00:29:02,561
Mine ancient prerogative still abideth, nor do I meet with dishonor, albeit my appointed place is beneath the earth and in sunless gloom.

331
00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:03,361
Good.

332
00:29:03,361 --> 00:29:03,840
Okay.

333
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,681
I don't understand now.

334
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:13,040
I take it that means then you've got to think what could be sunless gloom and a light not of the sun.

335
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:15,761
It must be just dim.

336
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:25,120
It must be like Norway in November or December or something when there's only the midnight sun and the snow hasn't fallen yet.

337
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:33,840
I have friends here from Norway right now who are just telling me these stories and awed at the fact that here it's so nice when Oslo it's so dark and gloomy.

338
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,961
So they they are they're in the they're in the twilight zone and they don't like that.

339
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,640
Okay, let's see now.

340
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,440
148.

341
00:29:41,441 --> 00:29:46,921
So they have no legitimate place at all, they feel now.

342
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:57,801
But there better be some marginal respect for even their world of feelings.

343
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:08,841
And otherwise they'll never be able to get any way to get any reconciliation between the Furies and Apollo, between reason and emotion.

344
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,441
And there is.

345
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:20,441
And at this moment, enter on the stage Athena, dressed like a man with armor and a spear, but clearly also a woman.

346
00:30:20,441 --> 00:30:23,880
She's a kind of synthesis of male and female.

347
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:40,041
And she is the only one who can get them out of the mess they're in because she's got a feeling for feelings because she's a woman.

348
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:51,320
And unlike Apollo, who hasn't a clue about feelings, he's just a total theoretical, abstract, detached, rational viewer.

349
00:30:52,441 --> 00:30:58,441
So Athena's now on the scene, and Athena's going to solve this somehow.

350
00:30:58,441 --> 00:31:01,640
She's going to solve it, in fact, three ways.

351
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,920
Keep your eyes open.

352
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:17,561
We're going to go into the part of the book now, which things happen pretty fast, but there are three totally different solutions that she makes to the mess that Orestes has sort of come to represent.

353
00:31:17,561 --> 00:31:28,640
And two of these solutions I think everybody has seen, but the third solution only you guys are going to be able to see, because you've got to be able to see with Heidegger's eyes to be able to see it.

354
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,840
And it's the important one.

355
00:31:26,441 --> 00:31:31,920
But we've got to get there step by step.

356
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,361
All of her moves, all three solutions are important.

357
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:37,200
So here we go.

358
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,560
She's strong.

359
00:31:40,561 --> 00:31:44,001
She knows, she says where Zeus' thunderbolts are kept.

360
00:31:44,001 --> 00:31:45,681
She has access to them.

361
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,160
She never has used them.

362
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:55,361
She never will use them because she has a special kind of talent, which is persuasion, she calls it.

363
00:31:55,361 --> 00:31:58,881
Persuasion is sort of like negotiation.

364
00:31:58,881 --> 00:32:06,880
That is, she understands the other side, and she's able to put things in a way that the other side can understand.

365
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,761
And she'll say at the end that it was thanks to her power of persuasion that she could do it.

366
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:31,441
And persuasion is this middle thing between being just a kind of raving, primitive, emotional throwback kind of female, which the Furies are, and a total rational character like Apollo is.

367
00:32:31,441 --> 00:32:34,400
She's got something in between.

368
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,480
And so now we have to go there.

369
00:32:36,481 --> 00:32:38,160
And it's facet, it's fun.

370
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,920
I mean, just the little details in this will strike you every once in a while.

371
00:32:41,921 --> 00:32:50,080
If you get struck by any little details like this that I haven't seen, which there must be plenty of, come and tell me at office hours or put them in your paper.

372
00:32:50,081 --> 00:32:51,761
Here's one that I came across.

373
00:32:51,760 --> 00:33:00,320
Ask yourself how these various figures in this debate, there are three figures now going to be important.

374
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,001
The Furies, Apollo, and Athena.

375
00:33:04,001 --> 00:33:13,081
And Aeschylus, I think, like any artist, he doesn't ask himself, how am I going to deal with how they arrive on the scene, but he just has an intuition about that.

376
00:33:13,081 --> 00:33:15,401
How do the Furies arrive on the scene?

377
00:33:15,401 --> 00:33:20,760
Well, running and plodding along behind Odysseus and all worn out.

378
00:33:21,961 --> 00:33:23,640
That's how we find them.

379
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,920
What's interesting is, how does Athena arrive on the scene?

380
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:31,961
Well, she arrives at the top of 149, sped on my weariless feet.

381
00:33:31,961 --> 00:33:35,561
I came wingless, but in a rush of speed, and so forth.

382
00:33:35,561 --> 00:33:37,800
So she's the opposite of the Furies.

383
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:43,721
She doesn't get tired because she's not like these feelings that go away.

384
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:46,120
So she can come on weariless feet.

385
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,561
But what about Apollo?

386
00:33:47,561 --> 00:33:48,601
This is the interesting thing.

387
00:33:48,601 --> 00:33:49,881
How does he get there?

388
00:33:49,881 --> 00:33:51,080
Anybody know?

389
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,481
Well, that's a trick question.

390
00:33:53,481 --> 00:33:54,680
He doesn't get there.

391
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,640
He's already there.

392
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,001
But he's already there in a sense that reason is everywhere.

393
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:00,361
He's universal.

394
00:34:00,361 --> 00:34:08,201
He doesn't come from some local place trudging along or on weariless feet like the sun.

395
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,681
He's already shining on everything.

396
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,041
He's already thinking about everything.

397
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:19,081
So rationality doesn't come on feet, weary or wearyless.

398
00:34:19,081 --> 00:34:22,041
I mean, that's the kind of little detail, I think, which is fun to see.

399
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:28,920
And what makes, I mean, probably part of what makes Aeschylus such an interesting playwright.

400
00:34:28,921 --> 00:34:29,880
So where are we now?

401
00:34:29,881 --> 00:34:30,520
Let's see.

402
00:34:30,521 --> 00:34:31,480
We got there.

403
00:34:31,481 --> 00:34:32,521
He's come.

404
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,561
And okay, let's, when I say about Apollo, he's like the sky.

405
00:34:37,561 --> 00:34:39,801
He's everywhere, is another way to put it.

406
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,201
So, and now, notice Athena's reaction.

407
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:52,201
Remember, Apollo's priestess was terrified, knocked, literally knocked over by the sight of the Furies.

408
00:34:52,601 --> 00:34:57,760
They were so disgusting and so awful, and something like she couldn't even understand what they were.

409
00:34:56,441 --> 00:34:59,680
I talked about that last time, I'm pretty sure.

410
00:35:00,001 --> 00:35:04,561
So now, what does Athena think when she first sees them?

411
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:07,041
Well, let's look on 149.

412
00:35:07,921 --> 00:35:21,281
She says, I came on wearyless feet and so forth, and now I see upon this land a novel company, which, though it brings no terror to my eyes, brings still wonder.

413
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,360
Well, that's a very different attitude.

414
00:35:23,361 --> 00:35:27,601
She thinks, gee, these are weird creatures, all right, but that's pretty fascinating.

415
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:35,281
And she's completely open to them and not disgusted or terrified.

416
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:42,160
And that allows her to play the same role for Aeschylus that she plays in the Odyssey.

417
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,841
She's open to all worlds, all forms of life.

418
00:35:46,081 --> 00:35:50,481
Go where no one has ever gone before and try to figure out what that is.

419
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:58,881
So there she is confronting these completely bizarre creatures from all the Apollonian point of view.

420
00:35:58,881 --> 00:36:02,961
And she thinks that's pretty amazing and is interesting.

421
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,881
So that's the same role, going from world to world, getting in sync with each.

422
00:36:08,881 --> 00:36:14,401
And now she's going to have to appreciate this world, namely the world of the Furies.

423
00:36:14,401 --> 00:36:19,761
And now that's where she's just like she was in the Odyssey.

424
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,201
But there's a very important way in which she's not at all like she was in the Odyssey.

425
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,601
And it's got to do with what kind of tolerance do you get.

426
00:36:29,601 --> 00:36:32,081
In the Odyssey, they are tolerant.

427
00:36:32,081 --> 00:36:37,440
The gods are tolerant of everybody, all the other gods, even Poseidon.

428
00:36:38,001 --> 00:36:42,921
But Athena isn't just tolerant, though she is.

429
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,881
What is she trying to do with the Furies?

430
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:48,360
I'm jumping ahead, but you've read ahead.

431
00:36:48,601 --> 00:37:02,841
Is she interested just in sort of setting up, sort of like maybe Israel and Palestine or something, two separate worlds, one for the Furies and one for the Apollonians?

432
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:09,881
That would be one way to keep them from fighting, to find another place, put them all away all together, put the Furies someplace else.

433
00:37:09,881 --> 00:37:11,400
Now, that's not what she wants.

434
00:37:11,401 --> 00:37:13,561
She wants to reconcile.

435
00:37:13,561 --> 00:37:15,160
That's a new angle.

436
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:23,640
She wants to somehow merge them in something that they're some higher something.

437
00:37:25,881 --> 00:37:30,521
It's very un-Homeric, this idea that you should harmonize them.

438
00:37:30,521 --> 00:37:34,281
And it's clear that this is a movement toward monotheism.

439
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:42,120
She wants to find one unified force somehow that they're both aspects of.

440
00:37:42,441 --> 00:37:44,201
And she does.

441
00:37:44,441 --> 00:37:47,640
What it is, I'm not ready to say yet.

442
00:37:47,881 --> 00:37:49,401
You're ready to say something good.

443
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,120
She revives what she's the border situation.

444
00:37:55,001 --> 00:38:01,561
Well, she's, yeah, she, but the funny thing is, you can get attuned to different situations.

445
00:38:01,561 --> 00:38:03,160
That's the Odyssey thing.

446
00:38:03,401 --> 00:38:05,720
There's nothing there yet to get attuned to.

447
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,481
She's trying to sort of create a situation, create an attunement.

448
00:38:09,481 --> 00:38:12,120
But, you know, even that's the wrong to say create an attunement.

449
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,961
She's got to create a.

450
00:38:15,401 --> 00:38:15,960
Funny.

451
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:18,521
You have to wait till you get there.

452
00:38:18,521 --> 00:38:26,640
She's got to create a new emotion, a new feeling, which creates a new situation.

453
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:30,000
And so she's sort of attuning, but she's not.

454
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:35,361
In the Odyssey, the situations are already there, and Athena just gets Odysseus in sync with them.

455
00:38:36,001 --> 00:38:40,001
What you can get in sync with is just a mess, because the culture is a mess.

456
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:44,481
It's full of suffering and violence and so forth.

457
00:38:44,481 --> 00:38:47,041
So she has to do more than attune.

458
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:51,521
She has to actually create a unified new emotion.

459
00:38:51,521 --> 00:38:52,160
Okay?

460
00:38:52,481 --> 00:38:57,360
And I don't want to jump ahead, but you'll soon see what it is.

461
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:00,881
But we've got to go through a whole thing before we get there.

462
00:39:02,481 --> 00:39:08,160
So now we're just going to go through the trial, which is pretty bizarre.

463
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,240
And I don't know about you, but at one point I felt like, well, I don't want to teach this book.

464
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,441
This is just too crazy.

465
00:39:13,441 --> 00:39:14,561
It's stupid.

466
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:18,961
Let's get there bit by bit, and I'll try to talk you out of that if that's what you felt.

467
00:39:18,961 --> 00:39:23,601
So Oreses restates his case on page 151.

468
00:39:24,081 --> 00:39:30,961
That's right where he said he was Absolute, but now skipping down to below the middle, he says, I came back.

469
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:32,400
He's talking about what he did.

470
00:39:32,401 --> 00:39:34,561
I killed the woman who gave me birth.

471
00:39:34,561 --> 00:39:45,280
Notice he doesn't say a mother, because remember how careful he was to say that she wasn't really his mother, but she sent him off to stay with friends at 11.

472
00:39:45,521 --> 00:39:47,601
She didn't take care of him and love him.

473
00:39:47,601 --> 00:39:49,441
So she's just the woman who gave him birth.

474
00:39:49,441 --> 00:39:50,961
He can't deny that.

475
00:39:50,961 --> 00:39:52,640
And I plead guilty.

476
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,881
My father was dear, and this was vengeance.

477
00:39:56,881 --> 00:40:00,401
You've got all kinds of bad things that are happening in the translation there.

478
00:40:00,401 --> 00:40:02,081
How can he plead guilty?

479
00:40:02,081 --> 00:40:05,281
He wasn't guilty, and he's got over his guilt feelings.

480
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,561
You rush to the translation if you're writing a paper in this, and you hope that you don't have to throw away the book.

481
00:40:10,561 --> 00:40:12,601
Well, it doesn't say I plead guilty.

482
00:40:12,601 --> 00:40:14,680
He says, I killed the woman who gave me birth.

483
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,201
I can't deny it.

484
00:40:16,441 --> 00:40:18,601
That's tape enough.

485
00:40:18,601 --> 00:40:20,441
He didn't say, no guilty.

486
00:40:20,441 --> 00:40:24,841
My father, and then that's this word for sire or lord.

487
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,120
And maybe he's not really saying father.

488
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,561
Maybe he's saying the king.

489
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:32,120
I don't know.

490
00:40:32,601 --> 00:40:33,720
Because you can't tell.

491
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,001
There's one Greek word.

492
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,921
So let's hope he's not making a fuss about his father.

493
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:44,761
Let's hope he was, remember, killing, because that would be to kill in the name of the furies.

494
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:57,081
If he did it because of a blood relative, he better do it because something like my lord, the person, the authority I respect, or something like that, was dear, and this was vengeance.

495
00:40:57,081 --> 00:41:02,521
Well, remember that there, you and the translator are free to do whatever you want.

496
00:41:02,521 --> 00:41:08,601
There's only one Greek word for vengeance, which means either vengeance or retribution.

497
00:41:08,601 --> 00:41:14,521
Vengeance is the fury thing, which you do in a fit of emotion and you slit somebody's throat.

498
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:24,040
Retribution is what you do legally when you punish somebody for something which it turns out is, in fact, wrong.

499
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:25,561
It goes against the law.

500
00:41:25,561 --> 00:41:31,001
So I'm going to have him say, my lord was dear, and this was retribution.

501
00:41:31,001 --> 00:41:32,680
And never mind before his blood.

502
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,041
That's not in there.

503
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:35,240
Period.

504
00:41:36,441 --> 00:41:40,761
Apollo shares responsibility for this, once you clean up the translation.

505
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:48,601
He counterspurred my heart and told me of pains to come if I should fail to act against the guilty ones.

506
00:41:48,601 --> 00:41:50,041
And that's right.

507
00:41:50,280 --> 00:42:00,480
Just to remind you, remember, Apollo has no power to threaten him with any suffering or any emotions because Apollo isn't in the emotions business.

508
00:42:00,481 --> 00:42:19,441
So Apollo, remember, at the very beginning of the libation bearers, threatens him with the furies will come after him because Agamemnon's furies will go after him because he's the blood relative who should avenge the death of Agamemnon.

509
00:42:19,441 --> 00:42:21,441
Remember all that, I'm just reviewing.

510
00:42:21,441 --> 00:42:27,120
And that's what Apollo has to do to get him upset enough to do it, that is to kill his mother.

511
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:36,481
But Apollo, at the last minute, they do it in the name of Apollo because Orestes asks Pylades what to do.

512
00:42:36,481 --> 00:42:42,321
So at the last minute, he does it not emotionally, not in the name of the furies.

513
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,120
That's all taken for granted now.

514
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:57,441
Apollo said there'll be terrible things will happen to you if you don't kill the guilty ones, but you better do it in the right way, or terrible things will happen to you anyway.

515
00:42:57,441 --> 00:43:04,640
And of course, terrible things did happen to him, even though he did it in the right way, because he went crazy with guilt feelings.

516
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:11,281
I'm just, that's where, and now he's explaining all that, justifying it, telling it just the way I told it, in effect.

517
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:18,081
And Athena hears it, and she says, the matter is too big for any mortal man who thinks he can judge it.

518
00:43:18,081 --> 00:43:23,601
Even I have not the right to analyze cases of murder where wrath's edge is sharp.

519
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:29,761
That is, where the furies are involved, she doesn't have the right to settle things.

520
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,400
That would be already to beg the question.

521
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:38,001
If she said she had the right to settle things where the furies are involved, the furies would already be not involved.

522
00:43:38,001 --> 00:43:45,081
So she's trying to say she doesn't have a way to settle things and not rule out the Furies.

523
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:50,440
But he's come to her as a clean and innocent suppliant, she sees.

524
00:43:50,441 --> 00:43:54,921
She says that, which is certainly what the Furies deny.

525
00:43:54,921 --> 00:43:56,841
So she's got a problem.

526
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:04,601
She sees that she shouldn't do what the Furies want her to do, but she sees that she can't just ignore them either.

527
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:09,401
And so at the top of 152, she's in a dilemma.

528
00:44:09,401 --> 00:44:12,280
So he says, yet these two have their work.

529
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,400
That is the Furies.

530
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:15,321
We cannot brush them aside.

531
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:24,041
And if this action so runs that they fail to win, the venom of their resolution will return to infect the soil and sicken all my land to death.

532
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:25,160
Here is a dilemma.

533
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,920
Whether I let them stay or drive them off, it is a hard course.

534
00:44:28,921 --> 00:44:30,361
It will hurt.

535
00:44:30,361 --> 00:44:35,081
You're supposed to hear an echo there of another dilemma, which was hopeless.

536
00:44:35,081 --> 00:44:36,041
Which one?

537
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:39,321
Whichever course you take, it's going to hurt.

538
00:44:39,881 --> 00:44:44,441
Yeah, Agamemnon sacrificing Ephigenia is one of them.

539
00:44:44,441 --> 00:44:49,801
And that was the first choice in which whatever you do is terrible.

540
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,081
What about the next one?

541
00:44:51,081 --> 00:44:53,401
There's another one.

542
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,880
Orestes facing Clytemnestra.

543
00:44:55,881 --> 00:44:57,400
I mean, he's got the problem.

544
00:44:57,401 --> 00:45:02,521
If I don't slit her throat, it'll be a disaster because the Furies will get me.

545
00:45:02,521 --> 00:45:08,120
And if I do slit her throat, it'll be a disaster because the Furies will get me because I'll be killing a blood relative.

546
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:12,440
And so, and that all reflects the mess the culture is in.

547
00:45:12,441 --> 00:45:15,160
There could be three decisions like that.

548
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:22,601
This is the last one, because Athena's going to fix it so these kinds of impossible situations don't arise anymore.

549
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,401
And how is she going to do it?

550
00:45:25,401 --> 00:45:28,001
Well, she's going to set up a court.

551
00:45:28,001 --> 00:45:30,241
That's solution number one.

552
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:36,721
She says, I will select judges of manslaughter and swear them in, establish a court into all times to come.

553
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:50,721
That's very important because what happened with Orestes is that he had to be both the judge and the executioner of Clytemnestra.

554
00:45:50,720 --> 00:46:06,800
He couldn't just be, so to speak, the, what's the opposite of the defense attorney, the prosecuting attorney, and show that she was guilty and should be executed, and then turn it over to somebody else to execute her who's not emotionally involved and not a blood relative.

555
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,921
That's how the court system works if you have capital punishment.

556
00:46:09,921 --> 00:46:13,601
They didn't have a court system for capital punishment at that point.

557
00:46:13,601 --> 00:46:23,761
That point being this mythical point in the past that Aeschylus is sort of making up to show the Athenians how they got the institutions that they've got.

558
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,481
And what they've got is a court system.

559
00:46:26,481 --> 00:46:28,721
And so she's going to set up a court.

560
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:41,280
And she's going to set it up, and she's going to get 12 jurors who are just normal citizens to hear the case.

561
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,961
So let me catch up.

562
00:46:43,601 --> 00:46:45,521
On 154.

563
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,760
Well, the furies are ranting on here.

564
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,880
Do I want to read this, though?

565
00:46:48,881 --> 00:46:51,120
I think I want to wait and read this later.

566
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:56,481
But they say absolutely weird things, but I'm not ready for that.

567
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:58,321
Skip to 154.

568
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:04,801
Athena re-enters, guiding 12 citizens chosen as jurors and attended by a herald.

569
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,721
Other citizens follow.

570
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,521
Now I have to make an aside, a kind of annoyed comment about the transcription.

571
00:47:12,361 --> 00:47:14,120
You notice anything amazing?

572
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,201
That they have 12 jurors?

573
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,360
And I thought, isn't that incredible?

574
00:47:18,361 --> 00:47:24,761
This thing is written into 400 BC, talking about a culture which is even earlier.

575
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:29,320
And here we are, 2,000 some years later, and we still got 12 jurors.

576
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,801
Well, it isn't in the Greek.

577
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,280
It doesn't say how many jurors there are in the Greek.

578
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:37,561
I discovered this when I saw another translation had 10 jurors.

579
00:47:37,561 --> 00:47:39,561
And then I just, that was Fagel's translation.

580
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,760
Then I discovered that there isn't any number of jurors.

581
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,120
See, nobody says anything.

582
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:49,321
That's all written in by the, what's in italics is written in by the translator.

583
00:47:50,521 --> 00:47:53,801
Aeschylus didn't write any stage directions in italics.

584
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,120
So he comes in with 12 jurors.

585
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,521
But the point is that she comes in with an even number of jurors.

586
00:48:00,521 --> 00:48:01,640
That's important.

587
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:07,480
It's funny that I just say, why there are an even number of jurors is very puzzling.

588
00:48:07,481 --> 00:48:16,041
You'd think it'd be better if there was an odd number of jurors so that they couldn't get into a situation in which they were split, which is what they get into here.

589
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:20,681
They discover they're split X to X, whatever number that is.

590
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,760
So here they are.

591
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,441
She gets them in.

592
00:48:24,441 --> 00:48:27,320
And now there's going to be a trial.

593
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:35,241
There's going to be an actual prosecuting and defending debate out in the open.

594
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,961
And then that's what takes place next.

595
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,120
Where are we?

596
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:53,481
Well, and now at this level, when the Furies are now not just the Furies anymore of Clytemnestra, and they're not even just the emotions in general.

597
00:48:53,481 --> 00:48:55,401
However, there's something in between.

598
00:48:55,401 --> 00:49:07,680
What I think the Furies are at this point is all righteous indignation when anybody breaks any law.

599
00:49:07,921 --> 00:49:10,320
I'll say this in an alcohol, but this is complicated.

600
00:49:11,361 --> 00:49:20,561
That would be too Apollonian, because that would say when anybody breaks any universal law, then you could have a universal kind of upsetness and the Furies would be out of business.

601
00:49:20,881 --> 00:49:27,761
They're still very local and particular, and they are still moral outrage.

602
00:49:28,081 --> 00:49:34,961
But they're now a funny collection of moral outrage at the top of 154.

603
00:49:34,961 --> 00:49:37,841
And this is puzzling to me, but I'll do my best to explain it.

604
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:47,041
They say, let man see this and take care to mother and father and to guests, welcomed in the gate, all so forth.

605
00:49:47,921 --> 00:49:52,560
Then, of course, I run, I run Polly, okay, thanks.

606
00:49:52,561 --> 00:49:56,080
Okay, so guests really upset me.

607
00:49:56,081 --> 00:49:57,601
I run to the translation.

608
00:49:57,601 --> 00:49:58,960
I hope that it's a mistake.

609
00:49:58,961 --> 00:50:00,160
It better be a mistake.

610
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,281
What in the world are the Furies doing thinking about guests?

611
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,041
Well, I can't find any translation that denies that it's guests.

612
00:50:07,041 --> 00:50:08,240
And I believe, yes, I did.

613
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,760
I asked somebody who read the Greek.

614
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,960
I was getting really desperate.

615
00:50:10,961 --> 00:50:12,561
It says guests.

616
00:50:12,561 --> 00:50:14,481
Well, then you need a new story.

617
00:50:14,481 --> 00:50:26,961
What are the furies now when they are the most generalized way of thinking about a certain aspect of the practices of the culture?

618
00:50:26,961 --> 00:50:32,881
Well, they're certainly moral outrage, but moral outrage about what?

619
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,760
Well, my story is, but I just make this up.

620
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:49,961
Aeschylus isn't giving me any help, is moral outrage about any damage to anything that anybody, particular people, identify with.

621
00:50:49,961 --> 00:50:52,281
So it could be your family.

622
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,640
It could be your school.

623
00:50:53,640 --> 00:51:03,081
And if people do bad things to Berkeley and you feel really important part of your life is to be a Berkeley student, you could feel moral outrage about that.

624
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,401
Could be your city.

625
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:16,681
Whatever it is that you identify with, if that gets mistreated, then you feel moral outrage.

626
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:21,561
That must be what the most general level of the furies are.

627
00:51:21,561 --> 00:51:28,120
And that keeps it from being Apollonian because it doesn't, it's very particular.

628
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,561
I get moral outrage.

629
00:51:29,561 --> 00:51:31,320
Perhaps I identified with Berkeley.

630
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:36,200
If bad things happen to Berkeley, maybe you don't, particularly, you're just, you haven't been here very long.

631
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,561
I've been here a long time.

632
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:38,680
But there may be something.

633
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,761
I mean, maybe your family.

634
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,561
But if I'm an orphan, then I wouldn't even have any family.

635
00:51:43,561 --> 00:51:45,481
Or at least not maybe I wouldn't.

636
00:51:45,481 --> 00:51:52,841
Anyway, so everybody can be particularly morally outraged about what it is that is very important to who they are.

637
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,920
And I think that must be the job if you're going to take the guest thing seriously.

638
00:51:56,921 --> 00:52:03,081
The other alternative is just to say some translator, some scribe early on when they were writing it down just blew it.

639
00:52:03,081 --> 00:52:03,640
Yeah.

640
00:52:03,961 --> 00:52:06,360
Well, there's sometimes it seems, that's interesting.

641
00:52:06,601 --> 00:52:15,320
You're off to the other possible move, that they like to put things in a way that will seem to the Apollonians to be what is it?

642
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:15,720
Let's look.

643
00:52:15,961 --> 00:52:17,001
Where what?

644
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:17,800
Okay.

645
00:52:18,921 --> 00:52:22,601
Oh, by the way, guys, you talk to pieces over and over again in front of us.

646
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:24,761
Yes.

647
00:52:25,081 --> 00:52:26,640
Okay, I want to talk about that.

648
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,761
That's important.

649
00:52:26,441 --> 00:52:31,760
But I don't think it's exactly a kind of Apollonian argument.

650
00:52:31,921 --> 00:52:36,640
But it is a kind of not exactly rational.

651
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:41,041
But I realize that I turn and told you not to talk.

652
00:52:41,441 --> 00:52:42,720
I'll come back to this thing.

653
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,201
Yeah.

654
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,280
That's a very smart question.

655
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,520
I was going to talk about that.

656
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:55,601
Put it on hold for a minute.

657
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,721
His question comes first in what I want to talk about.

658
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:10,400
So for you, what I think is going on is they have certain universal, I can't say, principles or ethical things.

659
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:26,960
What they're saying is, and I'm going to come back to it, that if you don't have emotions of moral outrage, the culture will become completely anarchic because everybody will be able to kill everybody without any compunction.

660
00:53:26,961 --> 00:53:29,760
That's not exactly an Apollonian argument.

661
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:38,000
It's a sense of, it's funny, it's a sense of the universal importance of emotions, of particular emotions of outrage.

662
00:53:38,961 --> 00:53:44,561
And it says, in effect, let's read it, that if you get rid of us furies, where is that?

663
00:53:44,561 --> 00:53:48,961
Every bad thing will happen to you because anybody will get away with anything.

664
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,160
Where is that?

665
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,201
It's somewhere around where we are.

666
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:59,680
And people will be killing each other and people will be killing their parents to get their inheritance.

667
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,321
It doesn't quite say that, but it sort of says that.

668
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,401
Let me see.

669
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:08,001
Ah, here it is in the middle of 152.

670
00:54:08,001 --> 00:54:11,361
Here is the overthrow of all the young laws.

671
00:54:13,561 --> 00:54:22,920
That is, none of your laws will work, you young gods, if the claim of the matricide shall stand good, his crime sustained.

672
00:54:22,921 --> 00:54:26,601
Should this be, and now comes his generalization that you're talking about.

673
00:54:26,601 --> 00:54:30,920
Every man will find a way to act at his own caprice over and over again in time to come.

674
00:54:30,921 --> 00:54:34,041
Parents shall await the death stroke at their children's hands.

675
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:37,160
That is, if you don't like your parents, just kill them.

676
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:40,601
Because nobody will feel guilt about killing their parents.

677
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:50,601
If you let him just slit his mother's throat and go away just after a little bit of absolution and say everything's okay, boy, are you going to have a terrible culture?

678
00:54:50,601 --> 00:54:54,520
I mean, if you get angry at your parents, you just kill them, and so forth.

679
00:54:54,521 --> 00:54:58,041
And that's a generalization, but it's a different kind of generalization.

680
00:54:58,041 --> 00:55:00,921
It isn't sort of what you should do or what you shouldn't do.

681
00:55:00,921 --> 00:55:10,360
It's about they have an in principle view about the role of moral outrage in keeping order in the culture, I think.

682
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,800
Now let me go to him.

683
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,521
Oh, Beatrice, I'll put you in the stack.

684
00:55:14,521 --> 00:55:15,081
What?

685
00:55:17,081 --> 00:55:24,040
When they say on the 153, we like the life devoted to one man.

686
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,160
Yes, but it's a.

687
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,521
I mean, I worry about that.

688
00:55:28,521 --> 00:55:30,921
All kinds of interesting things are happening in here.

689
00:55:30,921 --> 00:55:36,601
And one of them is: so, what is the where is it again?

690
00:55:37,561 --> 00:55:39,481
Okay, 153.

691
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:46,441
See, they are going to claim that there's a middle ground and that they're at it.

692
00:55:46,441 --> 00:55:50,281
And Athena's going to claim a different middle ground.

693
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:59,761
And because she thinks their middle ground is going to end up with self, with with a kind of back to vengeance again.

694
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,401
Because when they say, and now where is it?

695
00:56:02,881 --> 00:56:03,840
I don't see it yet.

696
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,081
Well, yeah, refuse the life of anarchy.

697
00:56:06,081 --> 00:56:08,721
That would be no emotions.

698
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,361
Refuse the life devoted to one master.

699
00:56:11,361 --> 00:56:17,680
I guess that must be Apollo's totally intolerant universal, but I'm not sure.

700
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,160
That's the best I can do there.

701
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,521
And what is the middle?

702
00:56:21,521 --> 00:56:25,841
I think the middle for them is whatever it is you identify with.

703
00:56:26,961 --> 00:56:33,521
That is, you can make it your family, or you can make it your city, or you can make it your company, or whatever.

704
00:56:33,521 --> 00:56:37,040
But it's got to be for them a local middle.

705
00:56:37,041 --> 00:56:49,681
And it's between a world in which there is no moral outrage and a world in which there is universal moral outrage.

706
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:59,440
It's, so to speak, in their thought, justified moral outrage when somebody does something bad to whatever it is that is yours.

707
00:56:59,441 --> 00:57:00,881
It's not universal.

708
00:57:00,881 --> 00:57:02,480
It's your identity.

709
00:57:02,481 --> 00:57:04,320
I think that's got to be their middle ground.

710
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,721
But if that isn't, come and tell me another.

711
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,041
And now I've got to take up his question.

712
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,360
And remind me.

713
00:57:12,961 --> 00:57:14,321
Can't say it again.

714
00:57:14,561 --> 00:57:15,281
Good.

715
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:15,680
Okay.

716
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:20,160
Let me repeat it because I got to do it for podcasts, and maybe you don't hear it back there either.

717
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,601
It's a very good question.

718
00:57:21,601 --> 00:57:28,721
She's just said this is too hard for any man, and that means any human being, at least, to come to a conclusion.

719
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:34,001
It's even too hard for her, which means even too hard for a goddess to come to a conclusion.

720
00:57:34,001 --> 00:57:35,360
And then what does she do?

721
00:57:35,361 --> 00:57:40,560
She just takes 12 ordinary people off the street to let them judge it.

722
00:57:40,561 --> 00:57:42,120
What kind of craziness is that?

723
00:57:41,441 --> 00:57:43,160
That's the question, right?

724
00:57:43,481 --> 00:57:47,721
Okay, it's a very, very brilliant, very deep kind of craziness.

725
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,601
I owe this to my colleague again, Joe Tussman.

726
00:57:50,601 --> 00:58:00,520
He's the one who explained why Artemis required Agamemnon to sacrifice Hippigania, which I never could understand.

727
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:05,321
Now the question is the weird trial that takes place.

728
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:09,960
And why is this a very deep thing to do?

729
00:58:10,441 --> 00:58:17,241
When the situation is so hard that you can't decide what to do, why in the world go out and just grab some people off the street?

730
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:22,360
Now, since it's not really my idea, but Joe's idea, I have to read it because I don't want to get it wrong.

731
00:58:23,561 --> 00:58:25,801
You're jumping ahead, but that's all right.

732
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:29,800
So, what in the world does the court system enable us to do?

733
00:58:31,401 --> 00:58:34,841
Why can they just take people off the street?

734
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:48,361
And then, this is what Joe Tussman said: they're just ordinary citizens, and you can't expect juries to reach wise decisions that resolve deep moral problems that are tearing apart a culture.

735
00:58:48,361 --> 00:58:52,281
But nonetheless, they could do four important jobs.

736
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,201
They do reach a decision.

737
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:57,801
No matter how arbitrary, they stop the fighting.

738
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:02,760
Or at least in some cases, they say, Well, now we'll give a billion dollars.

739
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:16,921
What's this, the latest thing I heard on the radio that some tobacco company was supposed to, was or wasn't going to give, I think, $500 million to some widow because her husband died from too much smoking.

740
00:59:16,921 --> 00:59:18,521
Well, they settled it.

741
00:59:18,521 --> 00:59:20,280
I'm afraid maybe they're a judge settler.

742
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:24,521
But anyway, you know, juries settle things, they reach a conclusion.

743
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,601
And now, that's point one.

744
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:35,361
And secondly, if the jury's decision is going to be respected, it better express the practices and values of the citizens.

745
00:59:35,361 --> 00:59:40,160
That is, that if they don't respect that, they won't have authority.

746
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:49,280
But if they do bespeak the current wisdom, no matter how stupid, they not only stop the argument, but people will obey them.

747
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,760
Here's a perfect example of that, it seems to me.

748
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,601
Pornography decisions.

749
00:59:53,601 --> 00:59:55,120
What is indecent?

750
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:58,400
Well, there is no right answer to what is indecent.

751
00:59:58,401 --> 01:00:09,041
But let's say they're having a big fight about whether, you know, somebody dancing around naked is expressing themselves artistically or exhibiting lewd behavior.

752
01:00:09,041 --> 01:00:10,561
And how do they find out?

753
01:00:10,561 --> 01:00:16,241
They get these 12 ordinary people and they ask them whether it was indecent.

754
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,880
And when they tell you whether it's indecent, that's the answer.

755
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:20,561
It's indecent, let's say.

756
01:00:20,561 --> 01:00:26,400
And that's not just completely arbitrary because that expresses what people in that community think is indecent.

757
01:00:26,401 --> 01:00:28,481
And that's what you're trying to find out.

758
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:34,801
And third thing, they don't decide whatever they decide in the heat of emotion.

759
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,601
They're not supposed to be 12 angry men.

760
01:00:37,601 --> 01:00:38,720
Anybody seen that movie?

761
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:39,760
It's such an old movie now.

762
01:00:40,001 --> 01:00:41,361
You've seen it, somebody?

763
01:00:41,361 --> 01:00:42,480
With Henry Fonda?

764
01:00:42,481 --> 01:00:53,840
The jury, yeah, I mean, the jury is all having their moral outrage about what bad things happened to them, which they're projecting onto this poor kid who's being tried for having killed his father, I believe.

765
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,521
Isn't that what he's tried for?

766
01:00:55,521 --> 01:00:58,401
It's a very Aeschylus-like thing.

767
01:00:58,401 --> 01:01:12,120
And the important thing is that Henry Fonda, the only sane person on the jury, tries to get them all to calm down and realize that they're not supposed to have react their own traumas, but to pay attention to what happened to this kid.

768
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:15,561
And so they're not supposed to be 12 angry men on the jury.

769
01:01:11,441 --> 01:01:16,520
That's important.

770
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:26,761
And I already said the fourth one: it's very important to separate the role of judge, jury, and executioner.

771
01:01:27,401 --> 01:01:37,160
And so no one ever again has to kill their own family because they've done something wrong.

772
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,000
And then, like Orestes.

773
01:01:39,001 --> 01:01:50,521
Okay, so there are four good reasons why it's even though nobody can really wisely decide, it doesn't matter, at least if you have a court system, there'll be some kind of decision.

774
01:01:50,521 --> 01:01:51,640
It won't work.

775
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,081
That's your intuition.

776
01:01:53,081 --> 01:01:59,080
It won't work to do the one thing that it really has to do, satisfy the furies.

777
01:01:59,081 --> 01:02:01,800
But it works for these, at least it gets this far.

778
01:02:02,041 --> 01:02:03,880
Orestes is off the hook.

779
01:02:03,881 --> 01:02:06,281
Nobody will ever have to do that again.

780
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:11,561
Can't be the executioner to kill their own mother because it'll be the job of the executioner.

781
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:23,001
And it does express, when it finally comes, when the court finally comes to a decision, something interesting, namely, we've already mentioned it, it shows how split the culture is.

782
01:02:23,001 --> 01:02:26,281
That six people are on one side and six people on the other.

783
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:33,481
When you get a hung jury like that, you're not going to get a solution that works.

784
01:02:33,881 --> 01:02:36,920
But if it isn't like that, it could have worked.

785
01:02:36,921 --> 01:02:44,760
It could have done something, stopped the whatever, got rid of the executioner, got the community on its side, settled something.

786
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,040
Okay, it didn't.

787
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:51,160
And that's part of, now we have to go back to what happens in the trial.

788
01:02:51,161 --> 01:02:57,280
It is so nutty that this is at the, it was at the trial that I decided I don't want to teach this book.

789
01:02:57,521 --> 01:03:01,680
And you know, how many know sort of how the trial came out?

790
01:02:56,441 --> 01:03:03,760
You must have, I hope, read it by now.

791
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,601
Not any, not very many.

792
01:03:05,601 --> 01:03:06,800
That's very strange.

793
01:03:07,281 --> 01:03:08,561
A little bit alarming.

794
01:03:08,561 --> 01:03:18,640
Anyway, the way the trial comes out is that they vote 50-50 on the side of the Furies and on the side of Apollo.

795
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:22,561
That is, whether Orestes is guilty or not guilty.

796
01:03:22,561 --> 01:03:30,960
And then Athena casts the deciding vote, which I guess even now the case, maybe if the jury is split, they can't go on.

797
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:35,920
But in this jury system, the judge, in a way, casts the deciding vote.

798
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,120
And what does she do?

799
01:03:37,121 --> 01:03:39,120
This is where you want to throw the book away.

800
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:43,920
She says, well, I'm going to vote for Apollo.

801
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:44,800
Why?

802
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:53,040
Well, I'm half woman and half man, but I'm really more like a man than like a woman because I didn't even, I wasn't even born of a woman.

803
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:55,200
I was born out of the head of Zeus.

804
01:03:55,201 --> 01:03:58,640
So I vote for Apollo and Orestes.

805
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,000
What a jury system.

806
01:04:00,561 --> 01:04:01,920
What a legal system.

807
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:06,080
It's the craziest reason for a decision you could possibly have.

808
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:17,680
And it has just all the features that a trial decision is supposed to have, except it doesn't work because you need more than that if you're in a totally conflicted culture.

809
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,521
I mean, it does, it could stop.

810
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:26,481
It looks like it's supposed to stop the argument, give a decision, take the matter out of Orestes' hands.

811
01:04:26,481 --> 01:04:28,561
She does it without being upset.

812
01:04:28,561 --> 01:04:35,920
It's not a question of the jury and her are all calm and rational when it happens, but it doesn't work.

813
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:37,840
And now we have to go and see about that.

814
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:41,160
I've got to catch up with where I am, so I'm catching up.

815
01:04:41,161 --> 01:04:43,561
So Athena sees there's no right response.

816
01:04:40,481 --> 01:04:46,601
I'm trying to catch up to where I am and not skip anything.

817
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:47,960
I may have already said this.

818
01:04:48,521 --> 01:04:50,760
Yeah, that's where I can't deal with it.

819
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:52,760
It's too big a deal even for me.

820
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:57,080
And on 152 at the top, yeah, the dilemma, I did that.

821
01:04:57,561 --> 01:05:00,441
So the Furies are all upset.

822
01:05:00,441 --> 01:05:01,960
Now we've done that.

823
01:05:02,281 --> 01:05:10,760
Well, I want to just repeat: the Furies have this big threat that Athena has to deal with, and she's trying to do it by the court system, but it didn't work.

824
01:05:11,161 --> 01:05:25,640
That is, they have this passionate response to anything that threatens any particular local aspect of the social world, families, cities, whatever it says.

825
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:33,400
Then people get very upset, outraged, indignant, and they do something that perpetuates the evil.

826
01:05:33,401 --> 01:05:39,720
So, and the two threats are, let's just get it clear, they could leave.

827
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:44,601
That's what we read already, where they then everybody could just kill anybody.

828
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:45,800
Where was that again?

829
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:53,240
Because it belongs at this point in the discussion, where you could kill your own parents and so forth.

830
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:54,361
152.

831
01:05:54,361 --> 01:06:02,361
So they could leave, and then they said, and if they did, everything would be in this case sort of anarchy.

832
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:08,601
Or, and this is the other thing they could do, these are things the furies could do if you don't treat them right.

833
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:12,760
They have their own ways of retaliation that she's got to be careful of.

834
01:06:13,401 --> 01:06:20,760
They could just turn off moral indignation, and then it would be total chaos.

835
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:25,920
On 152, also on one, let me see.

836
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,640
Here's the bottom is more of this.

837
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:34,080
We're the angry ones, but we should watch no more over works of men and so act.

838
01:06:34,241 --> 01:06:36,401
We shall let loose indiscriminate death.

839
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:41,840
That's a culture, I take it, in which dudes are dangerous for the culture.

840
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:47,120
If they have no feelings of moral outrage, then everybody can kill anybody.

841
01:06:47,121 --> 01:06:50,720
And what about if they have too much feeling of moral outrage?

842
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,120
Then everybody is going to try to kill everybody.

843
01:06:53,121 --> 01:06:54,640
So that's their other threat.

844
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:59,760
Their other threat is that they will soup up the emotions.

845
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:03,441
And then everything will go completely crazy.

846
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:11,441
On 165, she's trying to tell them not to do this bad thing they could do.

847
01:07:11,441 --> 01:07:29,120
At the middle of 165, do not inflict your bloody stimulus to twist the inward hearts of young men raging in fury, not of wine, nor as if plucking the heart from fighting cocks, engage, sorry, engraft among your citizens that spirit of war that turns their battle fury inward on themselves.

848
01:07:29,201 --> 01:07:36,240
So don't soup up people's aggression against all the other people or against themselves, which is interesting.

849
01:07:36,241 --> 01:07:43,601
I mean, how it's very ahead of his time to think that people could turn up their aggression, fury on themselves.

850
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:46,320
But anyway, everybody would be furious at everybody.

851
01:07:46,321 --> 01:07:48,401
Everybody would be ready to kill everybody.

852
01:07:48,401 --> 01:07:51,760
People would be so furious they'd even be ready to kill themselves.

853
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:55,840
That's what would happen if the furies souped up their thing.

854
01:07:56,161 --> 01:08:00,320
So they're really, she's got a terrible problem.

855
01:08:00,321 --> 01:08:02,320
I'm backing up to catch up where we are.

856
01:08:02,321 --> 01:08:04,720
So she sets up the court system.

857
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:07,521
And they do reach a decision.

858
01:08:07,561 --> 01:08:16,840
And but we go, but the trial is so nutty that you have to go through it just to see that it's the way the court system ought to work.

859
01:08:17,161 --> 01:08:20,201
But if the culture is completely conflicted, it's not going to work.

860
01:08:20,201 --> 01:08:21,481
But let's see what happens.

861
01:08:21,481 --> 01:08:23,080
So there's going to be a trial.

862
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:25,960
The Furies get a chance to state their case.

863
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:28,360
Orestes is cross-examined.

864
01:08:28,361 --> 01:08:29,880
It's all very rational.

865
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:34,840
In 155, first you have to establish that there was a crime.

866
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:39,561
They say in the middle of the page, you kill your mother or did you not?

867
01:08:39,561 --> 01:08:41,240
And he said, yes, I killed her.

868
01:08:41,241 --> 01:08:42,680
I won't deny it.

869
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:45,000
And then they say, well, how did you do it?

870
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,640
And at the bottom, he says, and this is where I got this throat slitting that I've been saying all the time.

871
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,960
He did it with drawn sword in my hand.

872
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,400
I cut her throat.

873
01:08:53,401 --> 01:08:55,240
So there's the crime.

874
01:08:55,241 --> 01:08:59,160
And he says, but she deserved to die.

875
01:08:59,161 --> 01:09:02,120
That's the middle of the page, 156.

876
01:09:02,121 --> 01:09:04,120
Tell me how and explain it to the judges.

877
01:09:04,121 --> 01:09:07,640
She murdered her husband, and therefore my father, too.

878
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:15,080
So Orestes is getting all involved in the father business, which is probably a bad idea.

879
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:18,680
The Furies say death has set her free, but you're still alive.

880
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:22,601
And Orestes says, when she lived, why didn't you descend and drive her out?

881
01:09:22,601 --> 01:09:25,400
That is, why are the Furies partial?

882
01:09:27,401 --> 01:09:34,601
Why did they have to use Agamemnon's furies to kill Clytemnestra through him or try?

883
01:09:34,601 --> 01:09:36,441
Why didn't they just do it?

884
01:09:36,441 --> 01:09:38,680
And they did say, and their answer was really amazing.

885
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:40,521
Well, we don't have to worry about killing her.

886
01:09:40,521 --> 01:09:44,760
Anyway, the man she killed was not a blood congenital.

887
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:47,240
So that's very tricky, you see.

888
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:54,280
Only a blood relative of Agamemnon can go after her.

889
01:09:54,920 --> 01:10:01,840
Just the fact that she killed her husband doesn't do anything to get anybody after her.

890
01:10:02,161 --> 01:10:06,481
Because from the Fury's point of view, there's no blood relation there.

891
01:10:07,121 --> 01:10:09,441
Marriage just doesn't matter.

892
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,160
And he finds that amazing.

893
01:10:13,441 --> 01:10:18,561
And then he says, so I'm, in effect, then he says, you've got to follow this if you want to.

894
01:10:18,561 --> 01:10:19,920
It's just bizarre, though.

895
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:26,160
He says, well, but you're saying that I should kill my mother.

896
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:34,640
That is, if you were Agamemnon's Furies, you would say, I should kill Clytemnestra, and she is my mother.

897
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:38,000
How can you ask me to kill my mother?

898
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:45,760
And they say, in effect, well, but I'm involved with something, by the way, by blood bond.

899
01:10:46,401 --> 01:11:01,120
So she don't have to kill Clytemnestra because she killed Agamemnon, but they're after Orestes because he's a blood relative of Clytemnestra and he killed Clytemnestra.

900
01:11:01,121 --> 01:11:05,360
And he says, but then I'm involved with my mother by blood bond?

901
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:08,960
And they say, yes, she nurtured you and so forth.

902
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,640
And notice we're back to that.

903
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,080
We just have time to settle that.

904
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:16,800
This is this business again of him saying, she's not really my mother, not my emotional mother.

905
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,040
She's just my biological mother.

906
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:24,000
And they're saying, well, look, she gave birth to you and nursed you, so she's your mother.

907
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,400
At which point, he gives up.

908
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:27,441
It's so funny.

909
01:11:27,521 --> 01:11:29,521
He passes the ball to Apollo.

910
01:11:29,521 --> 01:11:30,561
He said, I don't know.

911
01:11:30,561 --> 01:11:31,680
I can't deal with it.

912
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:34,880
And Apollo says, yours, Apollo.

913
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,800
And what does Apollo do?

914
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:47,000
He gives a whole thing about first, he gives his speech about how just he is and how fair he is and so forth.

915
01:11:47,321 --> 01:11:56,680
But then he gives this sort of modern science story in which he says the mother doesn't do anything.

916
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,640
There's no blood from the mother in the baby on 158.

917
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:04,601
Apollo, I will tell you and I will answer correctly.

918
01:12:04,601 --> 01:12:05,160
Watch.

919
01:12:05,161 --> 01:12:08,521
The mother is no parent of what is called her child.

920
01:12:08,521 --> 01:12:17,561
This is his defense to say, well, Orestes didn't kill his mother because the mother isn't even a mother.

921
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:20,441
The mother's blood isn't in Orestes.

922
01:12:20,441 --> 01:12:22,441
Clytemnestra's blood isn't in Orestes.

923
01:12:22,441 --> 01:12:24,360
The mother is just the womb.

924
01:12:24,521 --> 01:12:25,481
That's what they believe.

925
01:12:25,481 --> 01:12:29,880
He's just giving you the latest science.

926
01:12:30,281 --> 01:12:32,200
And lots of people believe that.

927
01:12:32,441 --> 01:12:38,760
The woman, the man planted the seed in the woman, and the woman was just the nurturing thing.

928
01:12:39,401 --> 01:12:43,000
And it grew, but it was strictly the man.

929
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,680
And that's what Apollo says.

930
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:47,080
And that's supposed to settle everything.

931
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:50,280
But now let me get back because I just have one minute.

932
01:12:50,281 --> 01:12:56,200
So Hapiklanus is not a, that Clytemnestra was not really his mother.

933
01:12:56,201 --> 01:12:59,720
Apollo goes and gives the same argument scientifically.

934
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:02,840
Clytemestra was not really his mother.

935
01:13:03,161 --> 01:13:14,760
And what happens after that is that he gives this scientific theory, there can be a father without a mother, he says on 158.

936
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:15,800
That's what he's proving.

937
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,720
And Athena says, yeah, I agree with that.

938
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:19,800
I've got a father and no mother.

939
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:24,120
And so Athena goes along with that.

940
01:13:24,121 --> 01:13:30,400
And so she does, she votes for Orestes.

941
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,401
And I think I can stop with that.

942
01:13:26,201 --> 01:13:33,361
Well, let me just see.

943
01:13:33,521 --> 01:13:45,601
I've got the so the jury votes, it's tied six to six, and she casts her vote for Orestes for this odd reason, 166, 161.

944
01:13:46,161 --> 01:13:55,280
The odd reason is there's no mother that gave me birth, and but for marriage, I'm always for the male with all my heart, and strongly on my father's side.

945
01:13:55,281 --> 01:13:58,320
And if the votes are even, then Orestes wins.

946
01:13:58,321 --> 01:14:00,640
Meaning, I'm going to vote for Orestes.

947
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:06,320
And that's when I say you want to sort of throw the book away, because that is the nuttiest trial.

948
01:14:06,321 --> 01:14:10,880
But then all you have to do is remember: trials aren't supposed to come to deep decisions.

949
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,040
It's just, you might as well flip a coin.

950
01:14:13,281 --> 01:14:15,521
At least it's supposed to settle things.

951
01:14:15,521 --> 01:14:16,321
But it didn't.

952
01:14:16,321 --> 01:14:17,760
And that's where we begin next time.

953
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:18,800
It didn't settle things.

954
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,561
The furies are not going to buy it.

955
01:14:20,561 --> 01:14:21,601
So we have to see.

956
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,281
Now let me just remind you.

957
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:26,960
Remember, I said Athena makes three moves to save things.

958
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:29,280
She's made one move, set up a court.

959
01:14:29,281 --> 01:14:31,441
Next time we do the next two moves.

960
01:14:31,441 --> 01:14:31,920
Okay.
