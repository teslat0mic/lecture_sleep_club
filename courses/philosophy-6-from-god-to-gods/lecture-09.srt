00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,521
Okay, I'm going to review because this is so dense and so many interesting ideas come at you all at once that I will talk about for the first 20 minutes or so, I think, the kinds of things we talked about last time, but that was a long time ago, and I can say them differently.

2
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:29,681
But the overall, and it's still all around this issue of what is a tragedy and whether Lattimore has got it right or not when he describes what a tragedy is.

3
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:41,281
I wouldn't, I mean, I probably would enjoy beating up on Lattimore anyway, because I get annoyed at people who don't see what's in front of them that are sort of trapped in 2,000 years of scholarly tradition.

4
00:00:41,281 --> 00:01:02,961
But more important, it wouldn't really be worth going over twice if it weren't that what's at stake between my way of reading it and the whole tradition and Latimer, is whether it's going to be a psychological tragedy, like, as Lattimore says, starts with Sophocles, but he reads it back, he reads it back into Eschelus.

5
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:21,360
That's, I don't know why, but is it going to be a pair of a tragedy of character about something wrong with a particular person who has got a flaw and it's always some version of pride or vanity that is their flaw and they will suffer for that and they will learn from their suffering.

6
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:34,480
That whole picture that they get from Aristotle seeing and reviewing Oedipus is what you see in Latimer, and it's the psychological.

7
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:52,121
But it just so happens that Aespelus is a lot more different, and for that reason, also, I think, a lot more deep, for both those reasons, a lot more interesting than the tragedies of character, which means a Sophocles to Shakespeare.

8
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,441
But it's hard to get a focus on that because it's alien, just like the strangeness of Homer.

9
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:10,120
And the humanists, the great books people are always trying to cover up or don't see what's alien because they want to see everything as culminating in the way we see things.

10
00:02:10,121 --> 00:02:17,800
So they can only see things as getting it right insofar as it's what we think, or getting it wrong if it's not what we think.

11
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,000
So let's go back.

12
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:23,880
But what's really happening, according to the way I read it, and you've got to make up your own minds.

13
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:26,521
You certainly shouldn't believe me.

14
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:32,600
I mean, a brilliant paper would be one that showed that I was completely wrong and that Latimer had it right all along.

15
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,801
I'd be amazed.

16
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:35,481
I would learn a lot.

17
00:02:35,480 --> 00:03:05,961
Anyway, as I see it, Clytemnestra is trying to get the chorus, which are the citizens, on her side, so that when she kills Agamemnon, instead of coming after her and Aegisthus, as tyrants and enemies of people, they will look on them as heroes because it was Agamemnon who was a brutal, selfish, vain, prideful guy, and they're the heroes because they got rid of him.

18
00:03:05,961 --> 00:03:23,281
So the question is, and Latimer sort of buys what Clytemnestra is saying, and that is that Agamemnon, quoting Vladimer, is a swollen vanity, and he talks about his fatal pride.

19
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,680
So that you've got to look and see.

20
00:03:26,001 --> 00:03:38,241
And I said last time, if you look and see, you see, I'm not going to go over the details, that Agamemnon is the sweetest, most modest, most trusting, good guy you could imagine.

21
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:45,281
He doesn't want to walk on the fancy family tapestry, but he doesn't want to cross the will of Clytemnestra either.

22
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:49,680
He's kind of a little bit of a too submissive husband.

23
00:03:50,001 --> 00:03:58,081
She wins that battle, which costs him a lot, his life, in effect, as to who's going to walk on the carpet.

24
00:03:58,401 --> 00:04:16,160
He's too trusting that instead of coming home like Odysseus and sort of sniffing out what's going on, asking at least somebody, maybe the watchman or the swineherd, what's up here, so he could at least know that Clytemnestra has married Aegisthus.

25
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,441
And it's not going to be simple for him to just walk in.

26
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:26,800
He's so trusting, he just says, hello, dear, I'm home, and gets ready to walk into the palace.

27
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,001
And then they kill him.

28
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:40,800
And the interesting thing is that they say of him that he is the nicest guy.

29
00:04:41,121 --> 00:04:42,320
I've lost that quote again.

30
00:04:42,321 --> 00:04:43,041
That's amazing.

31
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,401
No, 82, I think.

32
00:04:44,401 --> 00:04:45,920
I was looking for it last time.

33
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:47,440
I couldn't find it.

34
00:04:47,761 --> 00:04:49,120
But I did find it.

35
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:50,240
It's important.

36
00:04:50,641 --> 00:04:58,800
I found the quote where it says that he's a hero, but that's not as good a quote as the one on 82.

37
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,081
I'd have to jump ahead, but I'm going to read it now.

38
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:06,521
They're saying this after they find out that she's killed him.

39
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:07,800
But that's the same day.

40
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:16,120
It isn't as if, as Latimer tries to think, well, now that he's been dead a long time, they like him, even though they saw that he was a swollen vanity.

41
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:25,160
They just say on this important line, on 82, it would be about 1,452.

42
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:38,281
So the chorus says, I'll start a little earlier, oh, that can speed without pain, and this slow bed of sickness, death could come to us now, death that forever carries sleeping without ending.

43
00:05:38,281 --> 00:05:40,841
And why are they so upset that they want to die?

44
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:46,600
They say, now that our Lord is down, our shield, kindest of men.

45
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,760
That's Agamemnon.

46
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:53,240
It certainly doesn't seem that he is a brutal monster.

47
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,600
There is something weird that happens when he kills a Phijania.

48
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,360
I'll come back to that later.

49
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,040
And Dave was mentioning it.

50
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:05,160
And that's the one moment when he does not seem to be asleep guy.

51
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:12,201
And remember that he couldn't have done anything that was the right thing to do.

52
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:16,600
Because if he did kill Ophiginia, that's pretty awful.

53
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,401
And Clytemnestra will never forgive him.

54
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:25,320
And if he doesn't kill Clytemnestra, they're stuck on all this, and they'll either starve or go home.

55
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:30,281
And his soldiers will never forgive him.

56
00:06:30,281 --> 00:06:35,560
And he'll have failed in his job as king and failed in his oath to his brother Menelaus.

57
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,281
So we know that he's stuck.

58
00:06:38,281 --> 00:06:47,881
So there is nothing I said last time anywhere that suggests the pride-following vanity story.

59
00:06:48,200 --> 00:07:00,160
And then a student comes up to me and finds a line that looks like it refutes, oh, I was bothered to say yesterday and now, which is terrific that somebody should find such a line.

60
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:12,321
And you'll see in a minute, sometimes when you find these seemingly contradictions to what your interpretation, if you follow them up in another translation, you can find out that they really support it.

61
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:16,881
Well, anyway, let's look at the line and see what happens on page 95.

62
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:40,961
So this time the chorus is saying, having talked a lot about pride at the bottom of 94, and it all seems to be the pride to begin with, anyway, of the blood in the house going way back to the horrible scenes between Thaestes and Atreus.

63
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:52,881
But anyway, at about line 80, it says, and yet under veils I weep the vanities that have killed my Lord, and so forth.

64
00:07:52,881 --> 00:08:00,481
Well, that sounds like, at least first reading, that my Lord is certainly Agamemnon.

65
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:06,001
And the vanities that kill Agamemnon must have been his vanities, whose else?

66
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:08,001
And there you got it, you might think.

67
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:11,920
The tragic form that the humanists expect.

68
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:23,601
There's a guy whose pride or vanity made him do things, according to Clytemnestra, kill his daughter and a lot of other young men in a, which he thinks is a stupid war.

69
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:27,841
Anyway, there's stuff that made him do things that resulted in his death.

70
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,440
And I think, wow, then, and it sounds psychological.

71
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,921
It sounds like there's something wrong with him, his pride.

72
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,920
It's not something wrong, keep in the background.

73
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,321
Is there something wrong with a person or is there something wrong with the culture?

74
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,800
I said that last time, and I'll come back to that.

75
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,601
Here it looks like there's something wrong with him.

76
00:08:46,601 --> 00:08:50,441
So you've got to look up the translations.

77
00:08:50,761 --> 00:09:01,561
And the two that I found, and the most, one was, I weep the vain fortune of my master.

78
00:09:01,881 --> 00:09:04,680
There's nothing there about vanity.

79
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,721
I mean, vain fortune means unfortunate.

80
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:14,681
All this in vain, you say, which doesn't mean that anybody's got any vanity involved in it.

81
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:27,401
Or the best translation, the literal translation in the Harvard version, which is Greek and literal translation side by side, says, I weep the foul undoing of my Lord.

82
00:09:27,721 --> 00:09:28,680
So what is it?

83
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,680
It's Lattimore cheating.

84
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,841
He's switching around the translation.

85
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:40,361
I don't know whether he's lying or whether he just is so deep in his vanity story he can't see the Greek.

86
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,521
But apparently, I've checked it out now with somebody who reads Greek too.

87
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:49,561
There isn't any talk of the vanities that killed Agamemnon.

88
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,761
There's the talk of what a bad thing it was that Agamemnon got killed.

89
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,961
The foul undoing.

90
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,680
That's Clytemnestra, the foul undoing of Agamemnon.

91
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,721
So you never know.

92
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:06,521
Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose.

93
00:10:06,761 --> 00:10:07,721
I won.

94
00:10:07,721 --> 00:10:13,721
Lattimore is dead wrong, and he's fighting to cover it up.

95
00:10:13,721 --> 00:10:21,201
And if you're reading carefully and reading only his translation, he'll fool you into thinking that he got it right.

96
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:27,521
So, but Agamemnon has gone out of his way to show, I mean, I think this ought to be convincing.

97
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:28,801
It convinces me.

98
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,041
Agamemnon has gone out of his way to show, sorry, what am I saying?

99
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:41,761
Aeschylus has gone out of his way to show that Agamemnon is a good man, a good king, a good warrior.

100
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:47,041
The only thing that there is some question about is whether he's a good father, and we will come back to that.

101
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,840
But he has to show, why does he want to do that?

102
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,401
Well, he wants to show that Agamemnon was a model king.

103
00:10:57,361 --> 00:10:59,601
And I got it wrong here.

104
00:10:59,601 --> 00:11:01,760
Okay, my notes are all mixed up.

105
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:09,041
But what Aeschylus wants to show, he was a model king, and that from the point of view of the sky gods, he did everything right.

106
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:17,121
And that he was a bad father in the sense of the furies, that is on the side of the emotions.

107
00:11:17,121 --> 00:11:18,401
He did everything wrong.

108
00:11:18,401 --> 00:11:23,121
I mean, it's a terrible thing, it looks like, to kill your daughter.

109
00:11:23,761 --> 00:11:28,241
And so, but the real problem can't be that he had a tragic flaw.

110
00:11:28,241 --> 00:11:36,001
His problem was that the culture had two conflicting frames of justice, and that he was caught between them.

111
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:39,841
He couldn't do the right thing where the daughter was concerned.

112
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,361
There was no one right.

113
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:47,521
And so the choices that he had were restricted by the cultural background.

114
00:11:47,521 --> 00:11:49,040
That's the ontological part.

115
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,081
He's not a free, he's a free person.

116
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,560
Psychologically, he can make either of those choices.

117
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,321
There's nothing that forces him to kill Figinia.

118
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,160
He could equally not, he could refuse to do it and fail as a king.

119
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,440
He has a choice.

120
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,480
But what a choice.

121
00:12:07,721 --> 00:12:13,721
I mean, very narrow, very restricted, and all bad.

122
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,641
But it's not a question of psychological freedom.

123
00:12:17,641 --> 00:12:28,441
It's the culture that's put him in a situation in which, even though he can choose freely, he can't choose well, or he can't choose to do something good.

124
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:35,080
And that's the ontological problem that Aeschylus is interested in.

125
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:40,840
Now, the background, the culture can constrain the choices of the people in it.

126
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:45,881
Remember, every time I say this, I feel it's very important to keep repeating, what's the phenomenon?

127
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:53,160
Is this some spooky thing that Aeschylus is onto or that they were involved in 500 BC?

128
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,721
And we don't have that ontological kind of tragic problem anymore.

129
00:12:57,721 --> 00:13:07,160
And I'm going to say, no, you see it with women still, that the culture constrains their free choices and makes in some cultures all the choices bad.

130
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:17,561
You see it with, you saw it when the Native Americans were before Martin Luther King came and somewhat straightened things out.

131
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,881
You see it in many cultures for gays, less now.

132
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:25,241
But in all those cases, you see, it's not psychological.

133
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:30,121
There's not something wrong with the particular people who are women or gay or black.

134
00:13:30,121 --> 00:13:39,881
There's something wrong with the culture that makes it all a tragic situation to be black or woman and so forth.

135
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:47,160
And that's not because their character, their pride, their choice, or anything else.

136
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,561
It's not about them, people.

137
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:56,721
It's about the practices, the background, the culture, the values, however you want to describe it.

138
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,881
And so that's what we've got.

139
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:02,081
And that's what Latmore doesn't see.

140
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,721
Let's see where we are.

141
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,281
So back to this again.

142
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:10,321
So how does the culture constrain what's going on?

143
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,281
Well, and again, try to think of the phenomena, not just the strange words.

144
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:19,841
So whatever Agamemnon does in that culture, it's going to be a disaster.

145
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,800
Well, why?

146
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:34,401
Because though he's free to kill the daughter or not, but if he kills, let's see, what happens?

147
00:14:34,401 --> 00:14:38,001
I jumped over something, but let me say it.

148
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:46,081
If he kills Ophiginia, then Plyton Nesper is going to be furious.

149
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,801
This is a statement about the culture, but it's just also a statement about emotions.

150
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,440
And he's not going to be able to live with her.

151
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,161
She's going to hate him, even if she doesn't literally kill him in the bathtub.

152
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:01,521
Their life together is over.

153
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:15,921
And if he doesn't, then he's going to be sort of detested and looked down with contempt by the citizens and by the soldiers and by his brother and by the Trojans and everybody else.

154
00:15:16,961 --> 00:15:19,440
The emotions in both cases are hopeless.

155
00:15:19,441 --> 00:15:23,120
He's going to end up hated and/or despised.

156
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,640
A great choice.

157
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:41,160
So I just want to say again: the culture's style, the culture's interpretation, the culture's understanding of what it is to be a human being, sort of the, and finally in Heidegger jargon, the culture's understanding of being, is what sets up the tragic situation.

158
00:15:41,400 --> 00:16:00,360
Given the conflict between, and I'll put it one more way, emotions and reason in the culture, which is all very emotional, but also brand new and very enthusiastically rational, given that the result of what anybody does is going to end up suffering.

159
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:05,401
So back to Lattimore again, one last round of Lattimore.

160
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,921
It isn't, as Lattimore claims, a domestic tragedy.

161
00:16:09,161 --> 00:16:12,281
He's sort of shooting all over the place, not having a clear target.

162
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:17,481
He's sort of going off with the shotgun to try to find out what the problem is.

163
00:16:17,481 --> 00:16:22,360
So he shows, claims that it's a domestic tragedy, a war tragedy.

164
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,040
This is all on page 10 and 11.

165
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,560
A political tragedy, and a psychological tragedy.

166
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:33,320
That's the love-hate story he gets to play around in.

167
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,121
And there is something of all that.

168
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,761
He's not hallucinating quite.

169
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,680
But the culture has all these problems in it.

170
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:52,521
But they're all, those things, the domestic problems, the political problems, the psychological problems, are all symptoms of something deeper.

171
00:16:52,521 --> 00:16:55,720
They're, again, the culture's problems.

172
00:16:55,721 --> 00:17:00,120
And the only way to get out of it would be to change the whole understanding of being.

173
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:03,720
But the question would be: how would you do that?

174
00:17:03,721 --> 00:17:16,521
And all we know is there's got a lot of, you have to get a lot of suffering going because it's only through suffering that you the good wins out in the end, as the chorus and everybody else says every once in a while.

175
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:21,040
And by the end of the play, you don't have to trust me or Aeschylus or the chorus.

176
00:17:19,961 --> 00:17:34,160
You have to see the suffering and who suffers and how they suffer and why and why that might bring about a change of world, change of culture.

177
00:17:34,161 --> 00:17:35,761
But that's getting to the third play.

178
00:17:35,761 --> 00:17:40,560
By the way, I forgot to say at the beginning: for next time, read the humanities.

179
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,840
Don't let me spoil the plot next time.

180
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:54,080
You, as the Greeks, should be on the edge of your seat wondering how in the world they're going to get out of this mess or whether they ever could get out of this mess.

181
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,961
And in fact, maybe they can't get out of this mess.

182
00:17:56,961 --> 00:18:06,400
Cassandra, this is a little aside, but I think it's interesting, thinks that nothing could ever change the understanding of being.

183
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,800
Prophets are not people who predict things, prophets in Homer and prophets in Aeschylus.

184
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:23,680
But prophets are people who understand deeply what's going on and the understanding of being in the culture, what the culture really is committed to.

185
00:18:23,681 --> 00:18:39,840
And if the culture is committed to some very bad understanding of being, like, say, in South Africa or apartheid or in India, the untouchables or something, then prophets will be in touch with how much trouble and suffering that's going to cause.

186
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:52,080
So on 72, Cassandra, who's a prophetess, she's been named that by Apollo, and there's a whole side story in here that she refuses to sleep at Apollo.

187
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,761
Is that why she gets cursed with her?

188
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:57,440
Beatrice, you probably remember, don't you?

189
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,360
What happens between Cassandra and Apollo?

190
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,560
Oh, good, good.

191
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:08,521
Oh, that.

192
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:16,120
Oh, I was worrying about the sort of gossip in the background about why did he make her a prophet so nobody would believe.

193
00:19:16,201 --> 00:19:19,241
Did he sleep with her or she refused, I believe?

194
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:22,281
I think what happened?

195
00:19:22,281 --> 00:19:23,720
She had a child?

196
00:19:23,721 --> 00:19:25,881
Oh, she refused to have a child with Apollo.

197
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,441
I see.

198
00:19:26,441 --> 00:19:29,320
Okay, anyway, it doesn't matter.

199
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:38,920
When I say it doesn't matter, I mean if Aeschylus decides not to talk about it, that's because Aeschylus thinks it doesn't illuminate the tragic structure he's interested in.

200
00:19:38,921 --> 00:19:46,920
But he does show us a Cassandra who is a perfect example of a prophet in that she understands deeply what's going on.

201
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:55,560
She understands it so deeply, and that's sort of interesting, that she sees that nobody could fix it, that it's not a psychological problem.

202
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,721
This seems to contradict what I just said, that enough suffering can fix it.

203
00:19:59,721 --> 00:20:00,921
She doesn't see that.

204
00:20:00,921 --> 00:20:04,200
So you have to see who's right, me or Cassandra this time.

205
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:12,200
But the middle of 72, she says, there is a choir that sings as one that shall not again leave this house, ever.

206
00:20:12,201 --> 00:20:13,960
That's what I think is interesting.

207
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:31,401
If you think that the trouble of the Furies and the whole revenge culture, which is one way to put the problem, or the whole emotion reason conflict, is in the very structure of the understanding of being of the culture, then you think that they're going to be stuck with it forever.

208
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,880
And that's what she feels, being a prophet.

209
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,640
They'll never leave the house.

210
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:44,761
The song breaks the song thereof breaks harsh with menace and drugged to a double fury on the wine of men's bloodshed, there lurks forever.

211
00:20:44,761 --> 00:20:48,521
See, she's really, he's on this sort of special dimension.

212
00:20:48,521 --> 00:20:53,120
You couldn't say that sort of thing about any just normal events.

213
00:20:53,441 --> 00:21:04,560
Normal events, you can predict them, and they might happen, and they might not happen, but the forever level, that's got to do with the very structure of life in that culture.

214
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:11,921
So she says there lurks forever here a drunken route of ingrown, vengeful spirits never to be cast forth.

215
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:13,200
She's very clear about that.

216
00:21:13,201 --> 00:21:21,200
Hanging above the hall, they chant their song of hate, the old sin, and taking up the strain in turn spit curses on the man that spoiled his brother's bed.

217
00:21:21,201 --> 00:21:27,600
That's Atreus seducing the wife of Diestes.

218
00:21:28,001 --> 00:21:35,521
Now, what's interesting, and I don't even really, you don't have to know this, and you may not even understand it, but I think it's fascinating.

219
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:47,600
If the prophetess, or prophet, let's just say, is on to the understanding of being in the culture, then naturally they're going to be right about the most basic things.

220
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,481
And they're going to be able to predict that they're going to stay that way forever.

221
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:59,120
And they're not in the business of predicting particular events like who's going to win the Trojan War or not, and so forth.

222
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:10,560
But, and this is the funny part, if they're interested, if prophetesses apparently can't understand that the understanding of being could change.

223
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,001
That's what she doesn't see.

224
00:22:12,001 --> 00:22:23,040
She, because it might be possible somehow, though we don't have any clue yet how, to change the culture if there's enough suffering and you suffer in the right way.

225
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:33,680
And all the examples I gave you of the fate of women, gays and blacks and so forth, suggest that even the most awful cultures might well change.

226
00:22:33,681 --> 00:22:44,120
But anyway, she only prophesies by predicting something so deep that it looks to her like it can't change.

227
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:50,200
And if it can, it's some news that Aeschylus is going to give us that she doesn't have.

228
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:52,360
And that's all I want to say about that right now.

229
00:22:52,360 --> 00:23:01,481
But I think it's really fascinating what prof what prophets can and can do on this kind of Heideggerian ontological picture.

230
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:13,241
Okay, now we're still here and on what happened with something that bothers me.

231
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:23,640
I'm sorry to tell you, but there's an argument I want to make about Clytemnestra one more, and then I'll know where I am.

232
00:23:24,681 --> 00:23:27,481
Somehow, I skipped it.

233
00:23:27,481 --> 00:23:29,001
Just a second.

234
00:23:29,001 --> 00:23:31,640
Ah, yes, I've got to way back at the beginning.

235
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:48,521
Evidence against the pride-vanity view is piling up after the murder because Clytemnestras went all this trouble to try to set up the Agamemnon and get the chorus on her side.

236
00:23:48,521 --> 00:23:55,400
And the interesting, and she told about how bad he was and how he stepped on the carpet and so forth.

237
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,600
And the interesting question you have to ask yourself is: did she convince the chorus?

238
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,200
And the interesting thing is, it's hard to see things that aren't there.

239
00:24:04,201 --> 00:24:08,521
But that is, you've got to be sensitive to what doesn't happen sometimes.

240
00:24:08,521 --> 00:24:17,961
What doesn't happen is that the chorus makes any reference to all of her arguments against Agamemnon.

241
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:23,920
They say, remember, now we're on 82 again, our Lord is down, our shield, kindest of men.

242
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:26,080
So it didn't work.

243
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,121
Agamemnon only convinced Latimer.

244
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,040
Clytemnestra.

245
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:36,481
She did and didn't convince the chorus, and we weren't supposed to be convinced.

246
00:24:36,961 --> 00:24:48,640
It turns out that it's just a false case she's made against Agamemnon, and then, therefore, she hasn't succeeded in justifying the murder.

247
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:57,360
And on 85, that's where the talks about him as they call him the great man.

248
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,600
I mentioned that quote last time.

249
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,800
So that's it.

250
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,601
I just skipped a little thing that I wanted to go back and get.

251
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,521
Now I'm ready to go on.

252
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,080
But before I do, yes.

253
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:16,080
Well, I don't know.

254
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,761
Ah, good question.

255
00:25:17,761 --> 00:25:19,200
Well, how does she predict?

256
00:25:19,441 --> 00:25:19,921
Where is it?

257
00:25:19,921 --> 00:25:20,721
Let's look at it.

258
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,440
Oh, yeah, okay, yes.

259
00:25:23,441 --> 00:25:24,321
I worried about that.

260
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,560
Let me go back and read it and see what I thought.

261
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,720
About a third of the way down.

262
00:25:28,721 --> 00:25:36,160
We too must die, she and Clytemnestra, Cassandra and Clytemnestra.

263
00:25:36,481 --> 00:25:47,840
Yet die not vengeless by the gods, for there shall come one to avenge us also, born to slay his mother and to wreck death for his father's blood.

264
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,920
That means he's going to kill Clytemnestra for having killed Agamemnon.

265
00:25:53,921 --> 00:25:58,800
Outlaw and wanderer, driven far from his land, he will come back to cope these stones of inward hate.

266
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:05,720
For this is a strong oath sworn by the high gods, and he shall cast men headlong for his father fell.

267
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,641
Now, when I read that, we have to talk about it, I say, that's right.

268
00:26:09,961 --> 00:26:21,481
That follows from the deep understanding in the culture that the Furies are going to send Orestes back to kill Clytemnestra, and moreover, he's going to do it.

269
00:26:21,721 --> 00:26:25,080
But is that going to get them out of the curse?

270
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,521
No, it's not going to get them out of the curse.

271
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:32,600
As you will see at the end of the libation bearers, I would have to jump ahead.

272
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:45,720
She fails, she doesn't predict, unless there are other lines that I'm missing, she doesn't predict that when Orestes comes back and revenges his father, that that's going to stop the curse on the house of Acreus.

273
00:26:45,721 --> 00:26:47,481
No, that's just one more stage.

274
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:50,920
Then somebody's going to kill Orestes for doing that.

275
00:26:50,921 --> 00:26:55,800
I don't know who, when I think about it, I can only think Orestes is going to have to kill himself.

276
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:02,281
But in fact, it gets a more peculiar twist in the third play.

277
00:27:02,281 --> 00:27:03,241
But we're not there yet.

278
00:27:03,241 --> 00:27:05,961
But anyway, I stick to my story.

279
00:27:05,961 --> 00:27:07,481
She gets it wrong.

280
00:27:07,481 --> 00:27:10,360
And she gets it wrong in a deep, interesting, necessary way.

281
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,440
The prophet's got to get it wrong.

282
00:27:12,441 --> 00:27:14,200
Okay, I'm back to this.

283
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:18,281
So I've got an aside to remind you.

284
00:27:18,281 --> 00:27:23,080
I'm still reviewing, but now a transition to the libation bearers.

285
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,161
We really haven't got there yet.

286
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:34,600
Remember now, and I said it, but it's hard to keep track, that there seems to be one big bunch of furies, and they get assigned to certain people.

287
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:43,960
And I just want to say, and then you get Clytemnestra's Furies on one side of things, and Agamemnon's Furies on another side of things, and so on, and so forth.

288
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:47,160
And you wonder, well, which side of things are the Furies on?

289
00:27:47,161 --> 00:27:50,160
Well, the Furies aren't on any particular side.

290
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:55,600
They are against anybody who killed any relatives.

291
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:08,241
They are against anybody who killed anybody, any bloodshed, because they then stir up the relatives of the person who was killed to go back and revenge.

292
00:28:08,241 --> 00:28:11,680
They're just the revenge emotions, period.

293
00:28:11,681 --> 00:28:22,241
But it's important to know that they aren't any sort of particular people's emotions until they get assigned to particular people.

294
00:28:22,241 --> 00:28:25,761
And that sounds like a crazy thing to say, but I'll explain it.

295
00:28:25,761 --> 00:28:26,160
Yeah.

296
00:28:27,681 --> 00:28:28,560
Yeah, yeah.

297
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,361
I like that.

298
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,560
Yeah.

299
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,401
Okay, well, a good question.

300
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,840
How do they, how come the furies dispute among themselves?

301
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,200
Well, that's because it's very important.

302
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:47,761
Emotions lead to contradictions.

303
00:28:47,761 --> 00:28:50,241
It's like you take a cab and I take a cab.

304
00:28:50,241 --> 00:28:57,840
Now you've got your cab and I've got my cab, and they crash into each other and start to fight with the cab drivers or something with each other.

305
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:06,800
The furies that get assigned to Figinia crash into the furies that get assigned to who?

306
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,001
Well, let's see, Ephigenia's blood.

307
00:29:10,001 --> 00:29:11,920
It's a very bad case with the furies.

308
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:18,241
Her furies really get represented by Clytemnestra.

309
00:29:18,241 --> 00:29:20,320
She says she represents her furies.

310
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:29,440
But anyway, so Ephigenia's furies, by way of Clytemnestra, are attacking Agamemnon.

311
00:29:29,441 --> 00:29:30,560
Now, listen to this.

312
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,481
This is where your question comes in.

313
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:48,440
But Orestes' furies are telling him that he has to attack Clytemnestra's furies because Clytemnestra with her furies has killed Orestes' father.

314
00:29:48,441 --> 00:29:53,640
So now Orestes sort of jumps in his cabin, gets his furies out of the pool of furies.

315
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,600
What does that mean?

316
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:59,560
He gets all emotional and vengeful against Clytemnestra.

317
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:07,800
And when you put that in fury language, that means that his furies now are leading him to attack Clytemnestra and her furies.

318
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,481
And that's just the way the emotions work.

319
00:30:09,481 --> 00:30:11,880
That's why the culture is in a complete mess.

320
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,441
Yeah.

321
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:13,241
What's that?

322
00:30:13,241 --> 00:30:14,040
I couldn't hear you.

323
00:30:14,201 --> 00:30:15,241
Apollo.

324
00:30:15,241 --> 00:30:15,721
Wow.

325
00:30:15,721 --> 00:30:18,440
Well, that is a super question.

326
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:22,840
That question almost made me give up teaching this book.

327
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:30,120
And it leads to the absolute heart of what's going on in the libation bearers.

328
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,001
I don't know whether to try.

329
00:30:31,001 --> 00:30:33,001
I think I can't even try to answer it yet.

330
00:30:33,001 --> 00:30:34,360
But we're coming there soon.

331
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:52,121
But you're thinking of the first speech where Apollo sort of sticks the furies onto tells Orestes that the furies require that he kill Clytemnestra.

332
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,120
Now, what's Apollo doing in that?

333
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,241
Put it aside.

334
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:12,201
It's really wonderful and mysterious, and the whole way the libation bearers works, it took me, I don't know, 10 or 20 years to some TA named John Holbo, we have to put something in his honor, found out what's going on there.

335
00:31:12,201 --> 00:31:13,320
I'll tell you in a minute.

336
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,721
Let's just do the general thing first.

337
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:21,120
People in the play, listen, emotions are always someone's emotions.

338
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,120
That's what I'm saying to him.

339
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:26,800
But, and now I just want to again save you from Latimer.

340
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,560
At least that's my version.

341
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,481
Because I say you could save him if you can.

342
00:31:30,481 --> 00:31:38,400
Latimer thinks emotions are private people's sort of kinky emotions, like Freudian emotions.

343
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:56,720
That is, emotions of individual love and hate, and you hate your sibling maybe, or somehow you hate your father, or I don't know why, all kinds of individual stuff that you have to go to a therapist and get your psyche, that psychology straightened out.

344
00:31:56,721 --> 00:32:02,241
But the emotions in this play are individuals' emotions, all right.

345
00:32:02,241 --> 00:32:11,520
Critomestra has her furies and Agamemnon's, but they are, in a sense, public emotions, since they're the emotions that anybody would feel in that situation.

346
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,120
That's so different than modern subjective emotions.

347
00:32:15,121 --> 00:32:28,080
I mean, somebody has some kind of trauma in psychology, and you have your way of acting to it, and that gives you your special kinky personality, and I have a different way of acting to mine, different trauma.

348
00:32:28,081 --> 00:32:29,921
It's not like that at all.

349
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,441
Everybody reacts with the same way.

350
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:47,600
And the issue of love and hate, which is a modern psychological sort of issue, only comes up minimally in the relation between Orestes and his mother.

351
00:32:47,601 --> 00:33:00,881
His mother, I mean, Clydemnestra tries to play on his love, and the furies try to tell him to hate, but it's not an individual sort of family psychological story.

352
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,201
He has a reason to hate her that anybody would hate their mother if they did.

353
00:33:05,201 --> 00:33:08,441
They know she killed his father.

354
00:33:08,761 --> 00:33:20,041
And she has a reason to hate Agamemnon that anybody would have if of their husband, if the husband killed their child.

355
00:33:21,161 --> 00:33:23,320
So it's a very peculiar kind of emotion.

356
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:37,561
It's somebody's particular emotion, somebody's particular love or hate, but it's always the same sort of love or hate that in that culture, in that situation, anybody would have.

357
00:33:37,561 --> 00:33:41,480
See, that's what some modern therapist wouldn't say.

358
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:49,081
Everybody's very unique in their form of neurosis once you get into the private subjective side of things.

359
00:33:49,081 --> 00:33:51,161
Okay, I just had to say that.

360
00:33:52,761 --> 00:33:59,401
Now, and so people are just, again, people do have their own emotions.

361
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,921
So my hatred, my love, and so forth.

362
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,800
And I can contrast with Apollo.

363
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:15,800
Nobody says my Apollo or my daughter's Apollo, the way they say my daughter's furies, Kaiden has to say.

364
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,881
And that's because, remember, Apollo is universal reason.

365
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:24,761
He's totally detached from the situation.

366
00:34:24,761 --> 00:34:31,721
It isn't as if Apollo stands for some sort of emotion that everybody in the culture has and understands.

367
00:34:31,721 --> 00:34:52,001
He stands for not getting involved in having emotions, which in this new culture, everybody is beginning to find very interesting and will eventually lead to theory and science and being a detached observant and disinterested and so forth, which our culture has and perhaps no other culture does.

368
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:56,960
But so already you can see there's a big opposition.

369
00:34:50,041 --> 00:34:57,281
Yeah.

370
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,001
Wait, wait, let's find it.

371
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:01,520
Well, let me look.

372
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,881
I want to know whether we should wait or not.

373
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,840
Okay.

374
00:35:09,201 --> 00:35:10,001
Where?

375
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,561
Okay, 985.

376
00:35:14,161 --> 00:35:20,001
Good, good, yes, my father who sees all the sun, sees all, comma, the sun.

377
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,281
Yeah, it is too far.

378
00:35:21,281 --> 00:35:22,481
Let's wait.

379
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,560
That's what you wanted to point out.

380
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,761
That's right.

381
00:35:25,761 --> 00:35:43,281
Apollo, like the sun, sees everything from nowhere, so to speak, and has no perspective, no involvement, and not, and unlike emotions, which are always somebody's and from some perspective, even though they are always public, too.

382
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:47,121
Apollo isn't even emotional at all.

383
00:35:47,121 --> 00:35:49,761
Okay, now I'm ready for the libation bearers.

384
00:35:49,761 --> 00:35:52,001
We got just time to do it.

385
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:05,441
But the crucial question, as the audience sort of goes into the libation bearers, well, I think, I'm sorry, there's one more move that Aeschylus makes before that that I want to say.

386
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,601
On page 86, you get the end of the Agamemnon.

387
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:17,921
The chorus sees that this looks like this is going to go on forever, anger for anger.

388
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,601
Whoever watch shall pay.

389
00:36:19,601 --> 00:36:21,281
That's the law, and so forth.

390
00:36:21,281 --> 00:36:31,521
But Clytemnestra, this is just, in Aeschylus, you get constant reversals of what looks like is going to happen next doesn't happen next.

391
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:39,881
Right now, the reversal is Clytemnestra, happily, and sort of self-interestedly, thinks that now, thank goodness, the curse is over.

392
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:44,120
There are not going to be any more killings now that she's killed Agamemnon.

393
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:49,400
For one thing, there's nobody left in the house of Atreus that Agistas, but she doesn't think about that.

394
00:36:49,561 --> 00:36:50,441
Just read it.

395
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:56,840
So you see truth in the future at last, that I wish to seal my oath with the spirit in the house.

396
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,601
Those are the furies.

397
00:36:58,601 --> 00:37:03,081
I will endure all things as they stand now, hard though it be.

398
00:37:03,081 --> 00:37:16,201
Hereafter, let him, that should be it, remember the prepositions are funny, let it or her, it's the furies, let, let's say it, go forth to make bleed with death and guilt the house of others.

399
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:20,201
That is, we're done with this problem.

400
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:26,920
If there's going to be murders and revenges, they're not going to be in the Atreus household anymore.

401
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,080
And that's it.

402
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:33,961
It looks like she declares that it's over.

403
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,401
I thought maybe there was one more place that she declared it's over.

404
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,921
No, that's it.

405
00:37:41,241 --> 00:37:43,320
It's clearly not over.

406
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,241
And they're hoping at the end that Orestes will come and fix it.

407
00:37:49,241 --> 00:37:52,041
Okay, now we're ready for the libation bearers.

408
00:37:53,400 --> 00:38:00,281
So the question, and I've got to say it this, I'm going to say this over and over because it's so hard to read the libation bearers.

409
00:38:00,281 --> 00:38:03,481
For years, I couldn't make any sense of it at all.

410
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:14,201
Because the chorus goes from reasonableness to raving of furious upsetness back to reasonableness.

411
00:38:14,201 --> 00:38:19,561
Apollo, as he says, and rightly goes around and gets the furies on his side.

412
00:38:19,561 --> 00:38:21,761
It looks incomprehensible.

413
00:38:20,121 --> 00:38:26,000
But I can't even tell you quite yet what's going on, but we're getting close.

414
00:38:26,241 --> 00:38:37,041
So, and the audience should be on the edge of their seats, even though they've seen it every year for years because it won the ultimate Oscar for its year and gets performed every year.

415
00:38:37,761 --> 00:38:42,241
They still are on the edge of their seats because there's such an interesting, deep thing going to happen.

416
00:38:42,241 --> 00:38:52,000
So, here's the question you're going to have in mind: In what way is Orestes going to commit this murder?

417
00:38:52,241 --> 00:38:54,800
Killing, killing, you have to say, something neutral.

418
00:38:55,281 --> 00:39:03,920
They all know that Orestes is going to come back and kill Clytemnestra because that's required.

419
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,761
And that's now listen, that's important.

420
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:21,281
Required both by the Furies, because she killed his father and therefore a blood relative, and required by Apollo, because she killed a king and just killed a human being.

421
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:25,440
It's just against moral reason to let her go.

422
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,281
She would be sentenced by any court, and she would be killed in any revenge killing.

423
00:39:31,281 --> 00:39:36,000
So they know that they know that Orestes is going to come back and kill her.

424
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,641
And maybe I should read that, just so you know that.

425
00:39:40,241 --> 00:39:43,281
They're asking, saying that he's going to come.

426
00:39:43,761 --> 00:39:45,201
Maybe I can't find it.

427
00:39:45,201 --> 00:39:46,880
Oh, yeah, here it is.

428
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:49,920
Yeah, at the bottom is 88.

429
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,681
Horace says, But why, why then, you coward, could you not have slain your man yourself?

430
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,081
Who's oh, Aegisthus.

431
00:39:58,081 --> 00:40:04,160
They're upset that Aegis didn't kill Agamemnon instead of making his wife do it.

432
00:40:04,281 --> 00:40:10,921
Agamemnon's wife, but why must it be his wife who killed, to curse the country and the gods within the ground?

433
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,320
That is, by the way, mistranslated.

434
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,520
That sounds like the Furies.

435
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,720
It's really neutral.

436
00:40:15,721 --> 00:40:18,441
To curse the gods of the land.

437
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,960
So everybody's upset.

438
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:22,201
the high gods and the low gods.

439
00:40:22,201 --> 00:40:25,400
And then the one I wanted to read, oh, can Orestes live?

440
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,881
Be somewhere in sunlight still.

441
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:35,400
Shall faithful and gracious ever bring him back again to strengthen in strength of hand to overwhelm these murderers?

442
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,521
Okay, that's why I wanted to read that because now we're ready.

443
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:55,481
And the question is, when he comes back and when he kills Clytemnestra, which they are confident he will do, does he do it in the name of the Furies, in which case the culture of revenge goes on and on?

444
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:07,001
Or does he do it in the name of Apollo, which it looks to them, and in a way rightly, would stop the culture of revenge?

445
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:31,001
So everything depends on in the name of which of these forces, the traditional old blood revenge forces, the Furies, or the new rational, legal law justice forces, is he going to do it?

446
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:35,161
And we're going to be on the edge of our seats for a long time to find out.

447
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:38,040
Will he do it as the heir to the throne?

448
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:47,081
I'm going to read this, killing a usurper, an accomplice who murdered the king, so that the impartial, so that impartial justice is done in the light of Apollo?

449
00:41:47,081 --> 00:41:54,961
Or will he kill as a son, killing the murderer of his father, so that vengeance is done in the name of his father's furies?

450
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,281
Is this going to be an impersonal or a personal killing?

451
00:41:59,681 --> 00:42:03,840
Is he going to kill the father or the king?

452
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,521
Is he going to act in the name of the Furies or Apollo?

453
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,360
That's the first question you've got to ask.

454
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,881
The second question you've got to ask is, and will it work?

455
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,721
Does he do something that can end the furies and save the culture?

456
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:26,641
And last time I taught this, some student was very upset and annoyed, and rightly.

457
00:42:26,641 --> 00:42:31,121
How could some individual save and transform the whole culture?

458
00:42:31,121 --> 00:42:32,800
Isn't that psychological?

459
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,641
Isn't that unplausible?

460
00:42:36,641 --> 00:42:37,920
Well, maybe.

461
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,600
You've got to keep your eyes open.

462
00:42:39,601 --> 00:42:43,840
Does he or doesn't he manage to save the whole culture?

463
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:47,441
All that's up for grabs at this point.

464
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:55,921
So now we can understand where Orestes is coming from.

465
00:42:57,201 --> 00:43:00,000
I'm skipping something earlier just as I don't want to read all of them.

466
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:06,081
So the question is: is Orestes doing it in wrath or in reason?

467
00:43:06,081 --> 00:43:19,840
At the bottom of, at the top of 97, he says, the chorus, Electra says, to come to judge them, that's the law, or to give them punishment.

468
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,240
I take it that's vengeance.

469
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,721
And the chorus is simply one to kill them for the life they took.

470
00:43:26,721 --> 00:43:32,880
The chorus says, don't take sides, stay ambiguous, don't do it in the name of Apollo or the Furies.

471
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,081
That's not going to work.

472
00:43:35,081 --> 00:43:38,200
And then what happens?

473
00:43:38,201 --> 00:43:39,641
Well, you'll see.

474
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:44,601
So, one more way to put it: Orestes has too many motives.

475
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:51,241
That is, he's got so many reasons for doing it that it's going to be hard to tell what his reasons are.

476
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,800
It isn't exactly like reasons.

477
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,561
That sounds too rational.

478
00:43:57,561 --> 00:43:59,800
And it isn't exactly like desire.

479
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,881
That sounds too psychological.

480
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,721
There's something like that again, these public motives that he has.

481
00:44:05,721 --> 00:44:16,921
And the public motives are that he's got, he can do it as a son, he can do it as a subject of the king.

482
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,320
And so, but this is the bottom of 103, the very bottom.

483
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:26,921
He says, Here, numerous desires converge to drive me on.

484
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:30,360
I would say something like motives, but it doesn't matter much.

485
00:44:31,081 --> 00:44:34,361
The gods' urgency, that's Apollo.

486
00:44:34,681 --> 00:44:37,800
My father's passion, that's the furies.

487
00:44:38,121 --> 00:44:41,561
And these, the loss of my estates, wear heavily on me.

488
00:44:41,561 --> 00:44:43,721
Well, the loss of his estates gets dumped.

489
00:44:43,721 --> 00:44:45,000
I mean, that is not interesting.

490
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,681
That was interesting to Homer, and that was a big problem for Telemeters.

491
00:44:48,681 --> 00:44:50,440
But it's not a problem for Orestes.

492
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,120
He's got a life and death problem.

493
00:44:52,121 --> 00:44:54,120
Never mind his estates.

494
00:44:54,281 --> 00:45:03,960
He's got to be able somehow to manage to kill Clytemnestra without getting killed himself, getting to get out of the contradictions.

495
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,281
So now we have to see: can he do that?

496
00:45:07,241 --> 00:45:09,880
Now comes your question.

497
00:45:10,601 --> 00:45:23,520
What, as I say, kept me from wanting to teach this and sort of stopped me for a long time on having the interpretation I've been giving you is what Orestes says when he comes in at the top of 103.

498
00:45:23,681 --> 00:45:25,281
He's just coming.

499
00:45:20,041 --> 00:45:27,200
He says something.

500
00:45:27,281 --> 00:45:27,920
He appeals.

501
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,680
He asks Zeus to be on his side.

502
00:45:29,681 --> 00:45:34,961
But whenever you get Zeus on your side, it doesn't mean anything because he's behind everything.

503
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:40,001
So you've got to keep track always not of whether it's Zeus, but whether it's the Furies or Apollo.

504
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,521
But now, you ought to be able to tell whether it's the Furies or Apollo.

505
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,361
And here's the puzzling thing.

506
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:48,961
The big strength of Apollo's oracle will not forsake me.

507
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,320
When the oracle speaks, of course, the oracle speaks for Apollo.

508
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,320
So don't let that bother you.

509
00:45:54,641 --> 00:45:57,040
For he, I would have thought the oracle was a woman.

510
00:45:57,041 --> 00:46:00,400
I wonder if this is gender verb again.

511
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,681
The oracle of Apollo at Delphi is a woman, right?

512
00:46:03,681 --> 00:46:05,920
I wonder if, anyway, let's not worry about that.

513
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:13,441
For he charged me to win through with divine, with divination and so forth, and speech articulate.

514
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,520
And never mind all that fancy talk.

515
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,361
Skip down about 10 lines.

516
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:26,961
He said, and that's oracle Apollo, that else I must pay penalty with my own life and suffer much sad punishment.

517
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,120
Spoke of the angers that come out of the ground, the furies.

518
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,960
And what's Apollo doing talking about them?

519
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:41,281
For those beneath who turn against men, spoke of sickness, ulcers that ride upon the flesh and cling, and with wild teeth eat away the natural tissue.

520
00:46:41,601 --> 00:46:43,681
That's one of the things the furies can do to you.

521
00:46:43,681 --> 00:46:46,641
I think that's interesting, sort of psychosomatic talk.

522
00:46:46,641 --> 00:46:47,520
It just occurs to me.

523
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:56,800
This says that if you have bad enough emotions, it'll actually show up in your body, and you'll have ulcers, and you'll have, I don't know, every bad thing will happen to you.

524
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,320
They'll eat away the tissue, you'll become leprous.

525
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:04,400
He spoke of other ways again from which the Avengers, who are the avengers?

526
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,400
No, come on.

527
00:47:05,721 --> 00:47:07,640
I won't talk unless you're listening.

528
00:47:07,641 --> 00:47:08,840
Who are the Avengers?

529
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,681
Who believes in vengeance?

530
00:47:05,041 --> 00:47:11,320
The Furies.

531
00:47:12,761 --> 00:47:15,080
Apollo is only talking about Furies.

532
00:47:15,081 --> 00:47:27,800
The Avengers might attack, brought to fulfillment from my father's blood, to the dark arrow of the dead men underground, from those within my blood who fell and turned to call upon me madness and empty terror in the night.

533
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:39,000
Okay, all of that is Apollo telling Orestes that he'd better go kill Clytemnestra because otherwise Clytemnestra's furies will get him.

534
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,521
And why is Apollo doing it?

535
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,480
And why?

536
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,840
It's the same question.

537
00:47:44,840 --> 00:48:03,961
As you read the chorus speeches, you'll see, I'll give you examples, the chorus alternates back and forth between getting all furious and excited and revengeful and telling Orestes to run in there and stab his mother, cut her throat, she's a monster, talk.

538
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:08,761
And then they switch over as if they don't know what they're talking about and say, now be cool.

539
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:16,680
We wanted all this to be done in the most detached and fair way that you could possibly do it.

540
00:48:16,761 --> 00:48:20,201
I thought I would find you a quote like that, but we'll get there eventually.

541
00:48:20,201 --> 00:48:22,200
And how is this possible?

542
00:48:22,201 --> 00:48:22,681
How is it?

543
00:48:22,681 --> 00:48:29,561
Why is it true that Apollo has to bring in the Furies and that the chorus has to switch back and forth?

544
00:48:29,561 --> 00:48:38,281
Well, the secret is that Orestes, besides Aeschylus, has a principle which is very, very original and sort of enlightenment interesting.

545
00:48:38,281 --> 00:48:47,721
He thinks that all motivation, that the only reason anybody ever does things is from emotional reason, a not unreasonable idea.

546
00:48:47,721 --> 00:48:58,481
And that if you were a completely disinterested, rational, detached observer like Apollo, you'd never have any reason for doing anything.

547
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,320
And this was an interesting problem for the Enlightenment.

548
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,081
It helps to know that.

549
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:14,241
The Enlightenment was all for rationality, but there was sort of the bad boy of the Enlightenment, one very smart philosopher who didn't believe it.

550
00:49:14,241 --> 00:49:16,401
And that was David Hume.

551
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:22,881
And David Hume wrote a book, treated on human nature.

552
00:49:23,681 --> 00:49:27,520
You don't have to know this, but it's so perfect for what we're talking about.

553
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:33,601
David Hume says that reason is the slave of the passions.

554
00:49:33,601 --> 00:49:44,001
What he means by that is exactly what's happening in the play: that is, you can't do anything except on the basis of your emotions.

555
00:49:44,641 --> 00:49:47,840
And reason will go along with whatever your emotions tell you.

556
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:51,121
Your reason will rationalize it, and then you'll be able to do it.

557
00:49:51,121 --> 00:50:01,921
And this so much upset Kant, who you've been hearing about as the main Enlightenment guy, he read Hume, and he thought that was terrible.

558
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,281
I mean, rationality is supposed to be the guiding thing.

559
00:50:05,281 --> 00:50:10,161
So Kant made up a rational emotion.

560
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:15,441
In German ochtum, which you've heard the word, it means respect in this.

561
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:24,961
He thought, he said, people are attracted to do the ethical thing and moved to do the ethical thing just because it's the rational, ethical thing.

562
00:50:25,121 --> 00:50:28,401
And any other kind of emotion would just get in the way.

563
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,001
And what Aeschylus would say about that is rubbish.

564
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:39,560
There is only the only kind of emotion, there is no such thing as the rational emotions, Aeschylus thinks.

565
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:51,881
There's only the kind of emotions that the furies are representing, the kind of emotion that goes with outrage and revenge and so forth.

566
00:50:51,880 --> 00:51:01,401
You don't hear in this play about other kinds of emotions, not Kantian octum for the respect, that gets translated respect for the moral law.

567
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:10,521
You don't hear about, as you will, when by reading the Aeneid in a week, Aeschylus, Aeneid talking constantly about his duty.

568
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:17,161
You don't feel that people there do things for duty, not for just simple reasons and not for emotions either.

569
00:51:17,161 --> 00:51:29,320
You don't find anybody in this book talking about doing things out of Christian love, where your sort of God's love goes through you to other people and so forth.

570
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:40,521
There's only one kind of emotion, and that's something like outrage and other such extreme emotions drive people to do things.

571
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,840
Now you can understand two things.

572
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:52,040
Why Apollo calls on, tells Orestes not do it out of duty for me, do it out of respect for the moral law.

573
00:51:52,201 --> 00:51:53,641
There are no such talk.

574
00:51:53,641 --> 00:51:59,720
He says, if you don't do it, the Furies will get you, because that's the only way to motivate somebody.

575
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:06,840
But now you also see why the Course talks nonsense all the time in a deep, deep way.

576
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,201
I hope you see it already.

577
00:52:08,201 --> 00:52:20,281
The Furies want to motivate Orestes to kill Clytemnestra with total Apollonian detachment, fairness, legality, and so forth.

578
00:52:21,121 --> 00:52:23,441
But that's a kind of contradiction.

579
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:35,361
They can't, on this Aeschylus picture that reason is the slave of the passions and so forth, get Orestes to do it for anything but moral outrage.

580
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:39,600
But if they ask, if they get Orestes to do it for more outrage, then what happens?

581
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:45,041
The curse continues, and everything is completely messed up.

582
00:52:45,041 --> 00:52:52,000
So what happens is the chorus, you read it carefully, and you'll see, and I read it carefully and for a long time now I couldn't see it.

583
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
But once John Holbo said it, I see it, and I'll show you.

584
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:17,361
But the chorus constantly wants to get Orestes more and more and more and more upset, telling him how what a nice father he has, what a monster mother he has, what a duty, not duty's the wrong word, how the furies require that he kill Clymnestra till he gets foaming at the mouth furious to do it.

585
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,800
And then they switch and they become cool and rational.

586
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,721
And they tell him in effect, but don't do it when you're upset.

587
00:53:24,721 --> 00:53:26,241
Do it when you're calm.

588
00:53:26,241 --> 00:53:28,320
I have to find one of these quotes.

589
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,440
Where is it?

590
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:32,721
In the libation bearers, early on.

591
00:53:32,721 --> 00:53:36,320
Well, I know that if I just follow what I've written, I will get there eventually.

592
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,401
So I better just wait till I get there.

593
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:38,880
Okay.

594
00:53:39,201 --> 00:53:43,041
They want him to do it, and the word is in the translation, temperately.

595
00:53:43,041 --> 00:53:46,001
Don't do it in an emotional fit.

596
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,441
But then if you get all temperate, you won't do it at all.

597
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,361
So the mystery is in the play.

598
00:53:52,360 --> 00:54:04,960
How in the world, and this is what you should be looking for as you read it or reread it, how can they ever solve this problem of getting Orestes to get all enough, enough emotional to kill his mother?

599
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,840
I mean, that isn't just any old emotional.

600
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:12,921
That isn't as emotional as you have to get to, I don't know, steal something or hit somebody.

601
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:16,120
He's supposed to stare his mother in the face and slit her throat.

602
00:54:16,121 --> 00:54:19,001
I mean, that's very, very, very hard to do.

603
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:25,161
They have to get him so emotionally upset about the death of his father that he's capable of doing it.

604
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:33,800
And they have to get him cool enough that he can do it not in the name of his father, but in the name of law and justice and kingship.

605
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:37,001
And you'd think that would be impossible.

606
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,561
And Aeschylus pulls off a sort of trick to show how it happens.

607
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,840
And the trick is kind of interesting.

608
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,320
You watch and see how it's done.

609
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:58,201
But it's a cliffhanger till the last moment whether he can look and sold.

610
00:54:58,201 --> 00:55:00,121
But now we have to follow it in detail.

611
00:55:00,121 --> 00:55:00,440
Yeah.

612
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,721
No, I'm just, I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.

613
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:08,840
No, no, wait.

614
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:12,600
He's asking something that I don't understand why you would ask it yet, but let me repeat it.

615
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:18,120
Don't the Furies want him to use, do kill Clytemnestra in the name of Apollo?

616
00:55:18,121 --> 00:55:19,320
Why would they want that?

617
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:21,960
But you don't understand.

618
00:55:22,121 --> 00:55:22,520
I see.

619
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,201
Yes, he's right, of course.

620
00:55:24,201 --> 00:55:29,081
If they do it in the name of the Furies, if he does it, it's going to go on with the cycle of revenge.

621
00:55:29,081 --> 00:55:30,680
But that's the Furies' business.

622
00:55:30,681 --> 00:55:32,281
They love the cycle of revenge.

623
00:55:32,281 --> 00:55:33,961
They just thrive on it.

624
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:39,560
They're bloody, and they're bloody, they're blood drinkers, and the more revenge killings, the better.

625
00:55:39,641 --> 00:55:43,080
So they want him to do it in the name of Agamemnon.

626
00:55:43,081 --> 00:55:44,761
There's no contradiction there.

627
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,800
And Apollo, it's only Apollo.

628
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,481
And he's in this funny position.

629
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,400
I'll just repeat it.

630
00:55:50,121 --> 00:55:51,921
It's Apollo's problem, too.

631
00:55:52,241 --> 00:56:00,641
He wants him to do it in free, temperate, rational, legal way.

632
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:14,400
But he has nothing at his disposal to make them, to give him the emotional outrage or the emotional push to do it, because all emotional pushes come from the furies.

633
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,081
That's the problem.

634
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:22,721
So now let's the only way that you can see how this works is to follow it through now, and that's what we're going to do.

635
00:56:23,041 --> 00:56:24,881
So let me see now.

636
00:56:25,201 --> 00:56:27,281
I keep getting ahead of myself.

637
00:56:27,281 --> 00:56:29,521
Okay, so Apollo's told him that.

638
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,721
There we are.

639
00:56:31,681 --> 00:56:33,281
Then I talked about the enlightenment.

640
00:56:34,161 --> 00:56:35,840
I had this phrase here, which is interesting.

641
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:38,721
He has to work himself up to do it.

642
00:56:38,721 --> 00:56:43,601
And that working himself up to do it, that can only be done by the emotions.

643
00:56:43,601 --> 00:56:45,120
And that's the trick.

644
00:56:45,121 --> 00:56:56,081
But if he works himself up to do it and does it by the emotions, of course, then the whole thing is a disaster because they, just as Cassandra would predict, they stay inside the cycles of revenge.

645
00:56:56,081 --> 00:57:00,961
So I don't know exactly who's going to revenge whom after that because we don't have to worry about that.

646
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,281
So Apollo uses the furies and so forth.

647
00:57:05,281 --> 00:57:09,920
So the chorus speeches are very confused, but it's a necessary confusion.

648
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,921
It's a confusion which is part of the whole tragic situation.

649
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,001
And they start out calm, and they get more and more emotionally worked up.

650
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:31,761
But then, just when the deed is close at hand, when they finally have worked up Orestes to such a state that he's ready to rush in and cut his mother's throat, then they try to get control of themselves and him so that everything will become rational.

651
00:57:31,761 --> 00:57:35,800
And so let's see now.

652
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:51,881
The best plan I've written here, if you could do it, would be for Orestes to be motivated by the furies, worked up until the last moment, when he suddenly becomes cool and does the deed in the name of Apollo.

653
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:54,281
And damn, but how could that happen?

654
00:57:54,601 --> 00:57:57,001
Well, how many have read it already?

655
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,241
How many know how that happens?

656
00:57:59,241 --> 00:58:00,761
What happens?

657
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:02,681
Okay, go ahead.

658
00:58:02,681 --> 00:58:03,320
I don't need to know.

659
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,680
I don't want you to tell me what happens.

660
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:06,440
Anyway, we get ahead of the story.

661
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,160
Go ahead.

662
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,361
Yeah?

663
00:58:08,681 --> 00:58:09,320
Yeah?

664
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,480
Okay, we're going to get there.

665
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:14,121
I'll say it now, but it's more fun in context.

666
00:58:14,121 --> 00:58:16,761
He means that you brought her on yourself.

667
00:58:16,761 --> 00:58:17,400
I didn't care.

668
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:21,961
I'm only, the translation is bad.

669
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:26,201
He says, no, where is it?

670
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:27,961
126?

671
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,241
The middle.

672
00:58:29,561 --> 00:58:30,761
Yeah, I see.

673
00:58:30,761 --> 00:58:31,320
Yes.

674
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,360
Okay, yes.

675
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,281
You, I'm not killing you.

676
00:58:34,281 --> 00:58:42,681
I'm only a channel for killing you in the sense that you've done a deed that requires killing, and I'm the one that was required to do it.

677
00:58:42,681 --> 00:58:45,961
So, but it's really you that's forcing me to kill you.

678
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,721
This is a very peculiar argument.

679
00:58:47,721 --> 00:58:48,520
We'll get there.

680
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:50,200
Do you want to say more about it?

681
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:53,080
Who's the one in my show that's Barnes Martyr?

682
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,281
Why don't you just see it, you mean?

683
00:58:56,601 --> 00:58:57,640
Oh, that's interesting.

684
00:58:57,641 --> 00:59:03,000
He wants to know why you well, you never see on stage in Greek tragedy the bloody scenes.

685
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,721
It's not like America, current American movies.

686
00:59:05,721 --> 00:59:23,680
Whenever there's a bloody killing, it it's just the tradition, and it shows their sensibility that they're they'd be too upset to see the real, to do it the way Shakespeare did with bags of blood spurting out over the audience, so that the front row of the people were covered with blood when somebody got killed.

687
00:59:23,681 --> 00:59:25,761
That did not appeal to the Greeks.

688
00:59:25,761 --> 00:59:30,480
So it's always, they remember already we've seen it when they killed Agamemnon.

689
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:38,161
They took him into the palace, and then there were a moan from the palace, and then she comes out and says we just kill him.

690
00:59:38,161 --> 00:59:40,241
So the same is going to happen with Clytemnestra.

691
00:59:40,241 --> 00:59:44,561
When they finally get ready to kill her, Adagisthus, they do it offstage.

692
00:59:44,561 --> 00:59:47,521
And that's just the way they do it.

693
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,880
I think that's terrific.

694
00:59:49,121 --> 00:59:53,281
But we'd be bored.

695
00:59:53,281 --> 00:59:55,521
Yeah, does somebody over there have a hand up?

696
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,800
Okay, let me get further with this.

697
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:03,121
We will see, because these things will fit into place that you're asking about.

698
01:00:03,121 --> 01:00:05,281
Okay, so let's see now.

699
01:00:05,281 --> 01:00:10,561
So the chorus just starts out hysterical, practically, and stays that way most of the time.

700
01:00:10,561 --> 01:00:15,600
On 104, for instance, they are in their typical mood.

701
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:22,641
He says, Almighty destinies, let these things be done in the turning of justice.

702
01:00:22,641 --> 01:00:25,840
By the way, justice, of course, well, I don't know what the Furies are saying.

703
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:26,880
Oh, these aren't the Furies.

704
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,080
Aha, that's what.

705
01:00:28,081 --> 01:00:29,281
What am I saying here?

706
01:00:29,281 --> 01:00:31,121
The Chorus, by the word of hatred.

707
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:35,201
Oh, yeah, but you see, they understand justice in a fury way.

708
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:56,320
Remember, the justice and vengeance and right are all defined in context because nobody has, I guess, Aspos doesn't have a vocabulary for saying the difference between justice and somebody getting their just deserts by vengeance, and somebody getting their justice by a court.

709
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:05,641
So he says, anyway, but you can see that this fury talk because he says, it says, for the word of hatred spoken, let hate be a word fulfilled.

710
01:01:05,641 --> 01:01:11,080
The spirit of right, so right and justice, both of them now have been taken over by the furies.

711
01:01:05,201 --> 01:01:12,600
And spirit is a clue.

712
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:19,240
The spirit of right cries out aloud and extracts atonement due, blood stroke for the stroke of blood.

713
01:01:20,041 --> 01:01:25,960
So there's no question, but what they mean by justice and right is revenge, shall be paid.

714
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:27,480
Who acts shall endure?

715
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,721
So speaks the voice of age-old wisdom.

716
01:01:29,721 --> 01:01:31,880
Oh, boy, is that a fury speech?

717
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,761
And they're in a fury mood from the start.

718
01:01:35,081 --> 01:01:38,041
107, I just want to sort of follow it through.

719
01:01:39,081 --> 01:01:49,881
The chorus, the top chorus speech, he says, it says, that it is but law that when the red drops have been spilled upon the ground, they cry aloud for fresh blood.

720
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:52,201
Well, that can't be Apollo, for sure.

721
01:01:52,201 --> 01:02:03,241
For the death act calls out on fury to bring out of those who were slain, to bring out of those who were slain before new ruin on ruin accomplished.

722
01:02:03,241 --> 01:02:06,121
Yes, that's and they understand that.

723
01:02:06,121 --> 01:02:11,481
And Orestes gets worked up and joins them as he starts talking that language.

724
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:15,080
Hear me, you lordships of the world below, the furies.

725
01:02:15,081 --> 01:02:18,840
Behold, an assembled power, curses come from the dead, more furies.

726
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:24,601
Behold, the last of the sons of Acreus, foundering, lost, without future, cast from house to house.

727
01:02:24,601 --> 01:02:26,441
Oh, God, where shall we turn?

728
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:30,041
So Orestes is, they've got Orestes all upset.

729
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:35,641
And now, and I'm not going to go through the details because I want to be sure to get to something interesting.

730
01:02:35,641 --> 01:02:42,281
So then Clytemnestra comes on and confronts them.

731
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,281
They confront each other.

732
01:02:44,281 --> 01:02:49,640
And he becomes suddenly, totally rational.

733
01:02:49,641 --> 01:02:52,240
They go back and forth a lot, but I won't do it.

734
01:02:52,241 --> 01:02:54,080
Let's go on to 113.

735
01:02:54,081 --> 01:02:57,681
And now, he's confronting Clytemnestra.

736
01:02:57,681 --> 01:03:04,880
And the interesting thing is, when he finally gets to confronting her, then the furies...

737
01:03:05,041 --> 01:03:13,121
Oh, sorry, then the chorus puts on the brakes, and he puts on the brakes, and everybody tries to become rational.

738
01:03:13,121 --> 01:03:19,281
I'm still looking for this passage I've learned where they say, let everything be done in a temperate way.

739
01:03:19,281 --> 01:03:19,840
I wonder.

740
01:03:20,161 --> 01:03:21,681
I'm going to look one more time.

741
01:03:22,081 --> 01:03:23,521
Wow, 121.

742
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,281
Is that way back there?

743
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,320
Sometimes I'm looking in the wrong places.

744
01:03:30,161 --> 01:03:36,000
Yes, grant that those who struggles, temperate things done in the house, and so forth.

745
01:03:36,641 --> 01:03:37,761
That's right.

746
01:03:37,761 --> 01:03:39,760
Stand above those who hate.

747
01:03:40,561 --> 01:03:43,041
That's the hope.

748
01:03:43,681 --> 01:03:45,840
And I just want to keep that in mind.

749
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:50,161
And that's what makes him suddenly become rational.

750
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:55,040
And there's a quote from a person you probably never heard of, a writer named G.K.

751
01:03:55,041 --> 01:03:59,761
Chesterton, who says, the madman is not the man who has lost his reason.

752
01:03:59,761 --> 01:04:03,601
The madman is the man who's lost everything except his reason.

753
01:04:03,601 --> 01:04:07,440
And at this point, he becomes crazy from rationality.

754
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:12,320
And this is so, it's really funny if you've got that kind of sense of humor.

755
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:20,960
He's going to kill his mother with syllogisms and counterexamples, as if she were killed by taking sort of an elementary logic course.

756
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,961
You've got to see it to believe it.

757
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:29,040
Orestes becomes this absurdly logical person confronting his mother.

758
01:04:29,041 --> 01:04:36,360
And he says, she tells he has this dream about the snake that bit her breast, and instead of milk, there was blood.

759
01:04:36,681 --> 01:05:00,440
And he says, as if he was writing a paper in logic at the top of 113, if this snake came out of the place whence I came, if she wrapped it in robes as she wrapped me, and if, and these are all a big bunch of if-thens, and if its jaws gaped right around the breast that suckled me, and if it stained the intimate milk with an outburst of blood, so that for fright and pain she cried aloud, it follows then.

760
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:06,761
I mean, there it is, just a kind of logical argument that she nursed this hideous thing of prophecy, she must be cruelly murdered.

761
01:05:06,761 --> 01:05:08,281
I turn snake to kill her.

762
01:05:08,281 --> 01:05:10,681
That's what the dream portends.

763
01:05:10,681 --> 01:05:21,641
And then there starts to be a kind of debate after that, which is logical and funny all the time, as if Orestes turns into a star debater.

764
01:05:21,641 --> 01:05:26,041
So it looks like Apollo has won.

765
01:05:26,041 --> 01:05:38,681
So Orestes says in the next speech, three lines down: as they by treachery killed a man of high degree, but not, he doesn't say his father, a man of high degree, the king.

766
01:05:38,681 --> 01:05:39,880
But that's important.

767
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:51,721
Killed a man of high degree by treachery tangled in the selfsame net, they too shall die in the way that Luxius, remember that's Apollo, has ordained my Lord Apollo, whose word was never false before.

768
01:05:51,721 --> 01:06:00,441
So it looks like somehow, mysteriously enough, he's going to be able to do it in the name of Apollo, but he hasn't actually split her throat yet.

769
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:03,081
And it's not obvious that he's going to be able to do it.

770
01:06:03,081 --> 01:06:09,560
And he gets emotional when he gets near Aegisthus, because Aegisthus is the part of the blood curse.

771
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:14,680
So on 114, he gets pulled back into being emotional again.

772
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,520
And back and forth it goes.

773
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:19,800
And here he says, who's talking?

774
01:06:19,801 --> 01:06:21,600
No, Orestes.

775
01:06:20,041 --> 01:06:22,881
I thought it was the choruses.

776
01:06:22,881 --> 01:06:24,161
It was so emotional.

777
01:06:24,161 --> 01:06:29,281
Before he, that is Orestes, can say, where does the stranger come from?

778
01:06:29,281 --> 01:06:30,640
This is the top of 114.

779
01:06:30,801 --> 01:06:34,081
I shall plunge my sword with lightning speed and drop him dead.

780
01:06:34,081 --> 01:06:38,400
Our fury, who never starved for blood, shall drink for the third time, and so forth.

781
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,760
There he's all inside the revenge story.

782
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:46,720
That Augustus, you know, is the son of Atreus.

783
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,440
And I'm not going to keep this sound straight.

784
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,560
Theestes.

785
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:58,241
And so it's just a question of house of Atreus' blood, and he goes into a fury state, but he gets out of it again.

786
01:06:58,241 --> 01:07:00,560
If the question is, how are he going to kill his mother?

787
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:03,040
And he gets out of it again on 114.

788
01:07:03,041 --> 01:07:10,560
At the end of that speech, he says, and now I call upon the God who stands close to look on and guide the actions of my sword.

789
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:12,080
That's Apollo.

790
01:07:12,081 --> 01:07:25,440
So having killed Aegisthus in the name of the Furies, he's now going to kill Clytemnestra, which is the important one as far as his furies are concerned, in the name of Apollo.

791
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,360
So it seems.

792
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:41,760
And I, now, it all seems raving craziness for a while, but as long as you keep your eye on what's going on, you'll see that it's all a question of how he's under, remember, for the sake of what?

793
01:07:43,201 --> 01:07:49,520
How is he going to kill his mother without getting all emotionally upset to do it?

794
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,281
And we've got to see what happens.

795
01:07:51,281 --> 01:08:02,480
So the chorus who's getting nervous about this, because they don't want him to do it in the name of the furies, kill Clytemnestra, that means the curse goes on and the country's in a mess.

796
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:08,440
So the chorus says at the bottom of 120, now do I supplication, Zeus, father of the Olympian gods.

797
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,121
Aha, this is what I was looking for.

798
01:08:10,121 --> 01:08:11,000
Just what you said.

799
01:08:11,001 --> 01:08:17,161
Grant that those who struggle hard to see temperate things done in the house win their aim in full.

800
01:08:17,961 --> 01:08:24,920
And going on, Zeus, make him who is now in the house stand above those who hate.

801
01:08:24,921 --> 01:08:31,720
So all of a sudden, they're switching over to Apollo and the Zeus side of Apollo, or the Apollo side of Zeus.

802
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:32,840
Then hatred is bad.

803
01:08:32,841 --> 01:08:34,760
Temperance is just what he needs.

804
01:08:35,001 --> 01:08:36,920
The question is, can he kill his mother?

805
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:40,520
Can you slit your mother's throat with temperance?

806
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:41,640
And that's tricky.

807
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:42,360
Yeah.

808
01:08:43,001 --> 01:08:44,840
And that's 121.

809
01:08:45,161 --> 01:08:47,880
The top of 121.

810
01:08:48,201 --> 01:08:51,800
So now it's, I still want to go further here.

811
01:08:51,801 --> 01:08:55,560
So he just gets, he can kill Augustus.

812
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:56,760
There's no problem.

813
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:01,000
And he says that he does it on 128.

814
01:09:01,801 --> 01:09:03,080
Where am I?

815
01:09:04,201 --> 01:09:12,600
About killing Augustus, he says, and on the two-thirds down on 128, so shall my father, but not my father.

816
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:17,560
He's not going to do it in terms of bring in Agamemnon, but that great father who sees all the sun.

817
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:26,520
Look on my mother's sacrilegious handiwork and be witness for me in my day of trial, how it was all right that I achieved this death, my mother's.

818
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:29,400
As for Augustus' death, I take no account.

819
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:33,480
He was a seducer and he got his punishment and it was legal, no more than law.

820
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:38,440
So now we're back to the confrontation with the mother, which is the fun part.

821
01:09:39,081 --> 01:09:43,320
And so he confronts his mother, and things get tough.

822
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:45,961
And now comes the crucial question, but it's not done yet.

823
01:09:46,281 --> 01:09:48,440
Aeschylus has many cliffhangers.

824
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:49,161
But he turned.

825
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:52,400
But now this is all the further we're going to get today.

826
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,400
But now comes another funny thing.

827
01:09:50,121 --> 01:09:56,560
Remember, I said there has to be a trick.

828
01:09:56,801 --> 01:09:58,880
Aeschylus needs a trick.

829
01:09:58,881 --> 01:10:16,560
Because the question is: how, at the last minute, having worked himself up to kill his mother by calling on the Furies, is he going to be able to just stop and do it in the name of Apollo with no additional motives?

830
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:17,920
Now comes a funny question.

831
01:10:17,921 --> 01:10:23,121
You may have wondered, who is this guy, Pallades, who's been following him around for the whole play?

832
01:10:23,121 --> 01:10:28,241
You've got to pay an actor to stand there for a whole play and not say anything.

833
01:10:28,241 --> 01:10:30,960
Well, he's got one line.

834
01:10:30,961 --> 01:10:35,040
And he's got an important position in the play.

835
01:10:35,041 --> 01:10:41,520
Because now, at the very moment when he has to decide what to do with his mother, Orestes hesitates.

836
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:55,201
He's got the full force of the Furies motivating him, and he's got the full sort of logical power of Apollo telling him, don't do it for the Furies, do it for me.

837
01:10:55,201 --> 01:11:00,320
And he turns to Pallades, who's been there all along, and asks him what to do.

838
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:06,960
Now, do you see why the cards are stacked if he asks Pylades what to do?

839
01:11:07,921 --> 01:11:10,000
What's Pilates bound to say?

840
01:11:10,001 --> 01:11:12,400
What's his relation to this whole thing?

841
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,281
None.

842
01:11:13,281 --> 01:11:15,121
He's a total spectator.

843
01:11:15,121 --> 01:11:23,121
He's got nothing to do with the problems in the house of Acreus of the blood of who killed who and what bad things Clytemnestri did.

844
01:11:23,121 --> 01:11:28,640
So when he asks Pylades, he gets one sentence, crucial answer.

845
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:29,760
And where is it?

846
01:11:30,001 --> 01:11:31,680
Tell me where it is.

847
01:11:32,001 --> 01:11:33,920
125.

848
01:11:34,921 --> 01:11:44,040
Philadelphia says, what if, okay, he just says exactly what he has to say to make him do it for the right reasons.

849
01:11:44,041 --> 01:11:48,680
What then becomes of the oracles declared by Alexius, that is Apollo?

850
01:11:49,001 --> 01:11:50,600
What if sworn oaths?

851
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:53,241
Remember, that's their job, oaths.

852
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:56,680
Count all men hateful to you rather than the gods.

853
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:59,640
And Orestes says, completely rational.

854
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,320
I judge that you win.

855
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:03,000
Your advice is good.

856
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:10,760
And now he's become totally, insanely rational for the rest of the play, almost the rest of the play.

857
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:14,680
So first he says, I'm just going to read you this quick, come over, and you can read it on your own.

858
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:15,320
Come over here.

859
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,480
My purpose is to kill you over his body.

860
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:19,241
So that's what he says to his mother.

861
01:12:19,241 --> 01:12:20,520
And then they have a debate.

862
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,360
She says, I raised you when you were little.

863
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:23,800
May I grow old with you.

864
01:12:23,801 --> 01:12:25,880
And he says, you killed my father.

865
01:12:25,881 --> 01:12:27,241
You want to make your home with me?

866
01:12:27,241 --> 01:12:28,680
I don't want to live with you.

867
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:31,960
And she says, well, destiny has something to do with it, my child.

868
01:12:31,961 --> 01:12:36,520
And he, very cleverly, good debater, says, well, then destiny is so rotted that I'm going to kill you.

869
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,241
No problem.

870
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:39,560
Then she says, a mother's curse.

871
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:40,760
Are you not afraid?

872
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,961
And then it comes really interesting.

873
01:12:41,961 --> 01:12:44,840
He says, no, you bore me and threw me away to a hard life.

874
01:12:44,841 --> 01:12:50,600
She sent him away to strangers when he was 11, so that she could have the whole place to her and Augustus.

875
01:12:51,081 --> 01:12:54,760
It's like she sent him away to prep school to get him out of the house.

876
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:59,320
He says, no, you bore me and threw me out to a hard life.

877
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:06,600
That is, you're my biological mother, but you're not my psychological, that is, emotional mother.

878
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:09,000
And she says, I sent you to a friend's house.

879
01:13:09,001 --> 01:13:11,081
It's like I sent you to a good prep school.

880
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:15,640
That does not make him at all happy.

881
01:13:15,961 --> 01:13:19,320
And then it gets really rational in the middle of the next page.

882
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:22,080
She says, I think, child, you mean to kill your mother.

883
01:13:22,081 --> 01:13:24,080
It's just becoming crazy.

884
01:13:20,121 --> 01:13:26,480
And he says, it will be you who kill yourself, not I.

885
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,320
That is, you brought it on yourself.

886
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,960
Then she says, it's all perfectly logical.

887
01:13:31,281 --> 01:13:34,480
Take care of your mother's curse like dogs will drag you down.

888
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:38,480
And he says, How shall I escape my father's curse if I fail here?

889
01:13:38,801 --> 01:13:43,440
And then he says at the bottom, I just want to get the translation right, and we can stop.

890
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:48,320
He's ready to kill her, and he says, You killed, and it was wrong, now suffer wrong.

891
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:49,360
He can't mean that.

892
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:55,040
It says in another translation, you did a terrible thing, now a terrible thing is going to happen to you.

893
01:13:55,041 --> 01:13:58,480
And he drags her off stage and he slits her throat.

894
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,920
Now, we'll stop there.

895
01:13:59,921 --> 01:14:03,281
The question is: has Aeschylus called it off?

896
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,360
The audience is on the edge of their seats.

897
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:16,880
Did he succeed in doing just what we thought he couldn't do without being motivated by any fury forces, manage in the name of temperate justice, kill his mother?

898
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,440
It looks like it, but we'll see.

899
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:19,840
Okay.
