1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,040
All right, so let's imagine the Roman Empire around 14 Anno Domini, which is the time of Augustus's death.

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,679
There, the Roman Empire includes all of the civilized world.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,799
It includes what we now know as Spain, France, half of Germany, all of the Balkans, northern Africa, Tunisia, Turkey, Egypt, Greece.

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:30,879
And I say that it's all of the civilized world because everything that falls outside of its borders is thought of as barbarian territory.

5
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:42,080
Augustus had managed to establish the Pax Augusta, which is a time of relative stability, peace, prosperity for all of the provinces and for Rome and Italy itself.

6
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:55,920
Maybe we can see why, at least before the September 11th, the US was like the Roman Empire, because it unified for the entire world, accessible to it, was a unifying force.

7
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,999
It was giving an establishing culture and it was overriding national cultures or other native cultures.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,160
It was dominating both in terms of cultural values and of economic force.

9
00:01:06,679 --> 00:01:10,759
So whoever wanted to be someone had to do so in Rome.

10
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:24,119
Augustus now, Rome was a republic, and Augustus changed this system of government, or he stood at the end of a change of the government, and he was the first of the Roman emperors.

11
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,919
And he had inherited his power from Gaius Julius Caesar.

12
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:38,280
First, he was sharing the power with two other men, Mark Antony and Lepidus, in something that was called a triumvirate.

13
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,720
And his great uncle Caesar had done the same thing.

14
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:55,160
Then he proceeded on to defeat the other two triumviri, Mark Antony and Lepidus, and he also killed the biological son of Caesar, so to make sure that there was no blood lineage that was threatening him.

15
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,119
And then he was the undefeated holder of all power.

16
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:04,679
But that wasn't a very that wasn't such an easy position to be in because Caesar had been killed.

17
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:17,239
You guys know that Caesar was murdered and the reason for his the murder was that he had been offered the crown as king of Rome and the Romans said, we don't want a king, we don't want to establish a kingdom, we're a republic.

18
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,479
So what Augustus had to do was establish himself as a different ruler.

19
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:26,679
He couldn't rule Rome as a despot or king.

20
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:35,400
And so what he does first is keep the facade of the Roman Republic intact and he assumed only titles that were made him the honored first citizen.

21
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,959
He never assumed the title king.

22
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:46,599
He was first called Augustus, which is an honorary title referring to some religious authority, and then he was Princeps, which means first citizen.

23
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:52,079
So he always portrayed himself as the first of a number of citizens.

24
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,280
And then he spent the rest of his life building more and more power and assuming more and more titles.

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,400
He became emperor.

26
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,759
He pretty much held military power over most of the provinces most of the time.

27
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,160
And then when he had died, he became instantaneously deified.

28
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:17,679
So then finally he reached the status of God and had thus totally replaced the old system of value of the Republic with a new system of values.

29
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:26,559
Now, he wanted to establish himself as savior of Rome and as the rightful heir to the empire, and he wanted to glorify these new values.

30
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:32,080
And the best way to do that was to commission a work of art that would narrate this story.

31
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,919
And it would narrate the foundation of this empire with the Augustan rule as the finale.

32
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,919
And this work is the Aeneid.

33
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,479
It portrays the rule of Augustus as predestined historical goal.

34
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,319
And it links Augustus' family heritage to the founder of Rome.

35
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,200
Thus, the work served two purposes.

36
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:55,280
It was protection and glorification of Augustus and his war.

37
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:10,160
It was protection because it silenced potential Caesar murderers, and it did so by establishing a new virtue, a new emotion, namely theetas, or duty, towards the already fixed course of history.

38
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:24,320
So in the Aeneid, you find that to not serve your country, to not serve your people, to not serve the faith is a deplorable thing, and Augustus thus only did his duty in serving the Roman Empire as the first citizen.

39
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:34,720
And it glorified his rule by making it the happy ending of a long and arduous process of this new civilization, which was ruling the world by the will of the gods and of faith.

40
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:55,639
Another nice element of the Aeneid for Augustus was that it included a story of how the Roman culture of civilization that was now dominating came to overrule the previously dominating Greek culture and how it was ultimately superior because the Romans always had some sort of inferiority complex towards the Greek culture.

41
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:02,520
And the Aeneid told the story that Rome was as good as Greece.

42
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,599
And I think all of these are reasons why you can see how the Aeneid is some sort of anti-odysse.

43
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,840
It takes a lot of elements from the Odyssey.

44
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,759
You find a lot of the same people.

45
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,799
The gods have different names, but it's the same gods still.

46
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:20,439
And you have the similarity in story, in style, in outline.

47
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,480
Both are the stories of a homecoming.

48
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:32,599
Odysseus is coming home and Aeneas is coming home in a more metaphorical sense because he's founding Rome as the home of this culture.

49
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:40,999
But at the same time, you see that it's an anti-odysse because it describes how one of the Trojans is founding a new civilization.

50
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,640
And in the Iliad and in the Odyssey, the Trojans are the enemies of the Greeks.

51
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:52,200
So it's both attempting to create a link between Roman culture and Greek culture.

52
00:05:52,439 --> 00:06:03,960
Aeneas has a passage from Troy to finally Rome, but it's also establishing Roman culture as a superior way of being, which I think is important for Augustus.

53
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,039
Now, let me come to the second point.

54
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,280
How do we all come from the Orestea to the Aeneid?

55
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,320
The Orestea and the Aeneid are structurally similar.

56
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:20,919
Both recount the formation of a civilization, and then this process is heightened in a certain way.

57
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:30,160
In both, the gods or fate or both play a role in bringing about what is perceived as a predestined history, a historical goal.

58
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:49,759
And both, if you remember, describe the heritage of a house and then the development of this house of this line over several generations, and both glorify the status quo of the time in which they were written, thus being a passage from a society in a darker age, in a darker past to a civilized and glorious present.

59
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:57,840
But I think it's also important to see the differences between the two, because we have actually kind of a counter-movement.

60
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,599
In the Orestea, we have the overcoming of the curse inflicted upon the house of Atreus.

61
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:17,520
And then finally, we have the overcoming of the system of tribal justice and blood feuds, and thus de-emphasizing the importance of family lineage and blood heritage, and the introduction of the importance of citizenship, of participation.

62
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:25,759
At the end, we have the police, that is the ideal, is not anymore a king's lineage.

63
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,359
And another frame of justice becomes important, namely, universal law and justice.

64
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:35,919
And now, when we see the opposite in the Aeneid, we see the re-establishing of a blood lineage.

65
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:42,640
That's precisely what the Aeneid is trying to do, linking Augustus' war with Aeneas all the way back.

66
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,520
Of course, as I said, Augustus was pretty careful.

67
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:52,880
He always said that he's just doing his duty and he's just the first citizen and he doesn't want to be the king.

68
00:07:52,880 --> 00:08:00,319
But at the same time, he makes it makes sure that he is perceived as the son of a god at the very least.

69
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,560
Aeneas is the son of a god, so in the same line, he is the son of a god.

70
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:10,840
And then he's also adopted by Caesar, and Caesar was deified, so he's like double son of a god in a certain way.

71
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,640
And finally, he becomes God himself as the giver of law and peace.

72
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:22,200
I think the second point of comparison that's interesting is the two main characters, Orestes and Aeneas.

73
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,199
Or maybe not main character, but two.

74
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:26,280
Orestes, yeah, as the main character.

75
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:35,080
So we see that he does the right thing, but it seems that he doesn't do that out of a sense of duty, more out of a sense of ontological necessity.

76
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:37,640
He's more the tool of a cultural development.

77
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,919
And in the third play, we see that he is used as an example more than it's really about him.

78
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:49,160
As Professor Bruffin said, nothing really interesting so much happens to him in the third play.

79
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,439
He does what the god Apollo tells him.

80
00:08:52,439 --> 00:08:59,000
He does that largely out of fears, too, I think, and not out of this notion of personal duty.

81
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,720
And he gives himself over to the protection of the gods, but overall, I think he shows very little awareness.

82
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:11,320
And that's very different for Aeneas because Aeneas is constantly reminded by the gods of his duty.

83
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:18,600
He has a personal duty towards state and historical development, like Augustus, his heir.

84
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:28,120
And he seems also to feel the sense of duty all the time because he talks a lot about it and it's the main motivation behind most of his actions.

85
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:44,760
So we see how, although the awareness of the faith is sent by the gods, he has dreams and he sees signs, it is already more part of the human history and the human historical goals and needs to be achieved through agency and action.

86
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,680
Different from maybe.

87
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:54,160
Okay, so much for comparing now onto part three: the myth of the failed authorship, which is a little story about Virgil, the author.

88
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,640
It's the year 19 before Christ, and Virgil is in his 60s.

89
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:05,679
His health is very bad, and he's very famous at this point.

90
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,039
He's very revered, one of the most important poets of his time.

91
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,520
And he has been commissioned by the emperor to write this great work.

92
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,280
And at this point in time, he has been working for 10 years on it, for a long time.

93
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,840
He hasn't been working on anything else.

94
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,280
And in the work that he wrote before that, that's called Georgica.

95
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,119
He mentions something that's interesting.

96
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:38,960
He says, I will write about a holy monument, a temple of marble dedicated to Caesar of Tavian and the forefathers of the Julian heritage.

97
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,960
And this he says in 30.

98
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,600
Now, it's unclear whether he really means that he's going to write the Aeneid.

99
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:51,680
And that would be very interesting because you remember who else has said that works of art are like temples of marble.

100
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:53,280
Heidegger has said that.

101
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,680
And it would be interesting to refer to a poem and compare it to a temple of marble.

102
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:10,800
But we don't know whether he really meant the Aeneid, but what's clear in this quote is that he was thinking about Augustus as the father figure and he was already researching the.

103
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:16,240
Now suddenly 19 before Christ, he decides to travel to Greece pretty suddenly.

104
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:22,560
And he says, yeah, I want to see the landscapes that I'm describing to describe them a little better.

105
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:30,400
And that seems strange because he has such a he loves Italy, his life is so settled there.

106
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,039
And at that time, deep traveling was really dangerous.

107
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,280
He also takes his valuable manuscript with him.

108
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,880
And it's not really clear why he does that.

109
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:50,039
And he indeed falls seriously ill while he's traveling, has to return to Italy quickly, and there he dies.

110
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,119
I think we don't really know.

111
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,879
It seems to be a little in the dark of why he does it because it's largely in the realm of legend.

112
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:03,640
We don't have many sources, historical sources that tell us about this clearly.

113
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,720
So maybe it's all just a legend.

114
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:16,280
Part of the legend is that Virgil had talked to a friend before he set out for the journey and has said to his friend, Various, you know what, if something happens to me, I want everything to be burned.

115
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,959
Don't keep any of the manuscripts I haven't published, just burn everything.

116
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:30,039
And when he dies, Augustus steps in and says, no, we're not burning them, we're publishing the Aeneid, it's a great work.

117
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:36,360
And he gives the manuscript over for publication and it's published and it becomes a bestseller right away.

118
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:42,520
Now why is this anecdote of the failed authorship important and what does it mean?

119
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:55,240
There's one interpretation that says that it's for protecting Virgil's reputations that the friends were worried that it wasn't so good and therefore they said, well, he himself didn't want it published.

120
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:04,280
Though, I mean, in light of the immediate success in the yeah, the it was had like raving reviews all around.

121
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:06,920
It seems not such a good explanation.

122
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:11,719
Then I think the second explanation is much better, that it's enhancing the state-building myths.

123
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:21,160
So Augustus steps in and says, despite the author's inability to see this, this is the real story of how we came to be a great civilization.

124
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:29,280
And thus it adds more to the myth or the legend of how the Aeneid is really this work of art.

125
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,560
So we see that there are several intentions here with this work.

126
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:36,480
First, of course, it's the poet who tries to write this commissioned work.

127
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:47,039
And then secondly, we see this effort by Augustus to glorify the work as depicting the cultural values that he wants to promote for his own security and power.

128
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,919
That brings me to part four.

129
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,120
Very quickly, I want to leave you with the question, is the Aeneid a work of art?

130
00:13:55,439 --> 00:14:08,480
There's a passage in Heidegger's Origin of the Work of Art where he says with some sort of wry humor, he says, well, it's not the artists hanging out in the galleries, it's the works of art hanging there.

131
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:24,000
And what he's referring to here is that he doesn't think that there's this sort of agency and intentionality necessary for a work of art that you typically think of when you think of an artifact, of something that's made by a human agent or by another agent.

132
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:35,520
Because for Heidegger, the work of art functions very different from any other tool that you will make, and it functions largely independently or despite the intention of its maker.

133
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:44,320
Now, it is really true that anything could become a work of art, that if it glorifies and unifies a way of being, then it is a work of art.

134
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:59,920
And I want to leave you with the question: well, how do Virgil's intentions to create this work of art in Heidegger's sense and Augustus's intentions to hire Virgil to do just that, how do they stand in relation to this success of the Aeneid?

135
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:01,760
Do they contribute?

136
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,800
Does the intention contribute to the success as a work of art?

137
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:07,800
Is it of no importance or is it a hindrance?

138
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,199
Maybe you can think about that.

139
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,600
I want to ask you a question, but I haven't keep your microphone there.

140
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:22,200
I've always wondered about a certain passage I never thought of asking Herb and so what she was saying.

141
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:32,120
You must know, but if you don't want to talk about it, so next time, this passage in which it looks like he wants to say that the whole thing, the whole history of Rome is a false dream.

142
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:33,719
Have you ever thought about that?

143
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:35,080
No, but it's great.

144
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:37,720
It's a perfect quote for my interpretation from the case.

145
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:40,200
Look on page 160.

146
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:48,520
There's this which is the whole history of the Roman Empire of the world.

147
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:57,560
And then they're leaving the slight wavy type of a dream.

148
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:04,200
And then it turns out that there are two doors and in closed phase.

149
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:16,199
That is, in this case, there would be something like whatever is true about these people go out one door and the false dreams or the sort of false illusions go out the other door.

150
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:17,160
And guess what?

151
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,400
Aeneas goes out the illusion door.

152
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,999
I've always thought that was the hope.

153
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,959
Yeah, I think it would be wonderful if it means that it's a criticism on Augustan law.

154
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:39,319
But I think there is another interpretation maybe because in the underworld, in the Roman underworld, which by the way is now accessible via Italy, not Greece anymore, there is another cake where you can get there.

155
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:44,280
And it's organized in such a way that the souls wait for being called out again.

156
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:47,479
So it's a cyclical idea that you are reborn.

157
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:51,840
And I would think maybe they don't go through there because they're not sold yet.

158
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,880
They're not shades.

159
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:59,759
They can't go through the gate for the reborn shades because they're not reincarnated.

160
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,880
No, he's still.

161
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,080
No, I think he just has the description of the path.

162
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:11,599
I see, but by himself, he goes out the gate that isn't for reborn true.

163
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:13,919
I think so, because he's not dead yet.

164
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,039
So it's really ambiguous.

165
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:16,239
Yeah, it's nice.

166
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:18,880
It seems to me it could be open.

167
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,959
Remember, it goes with saying burnt.

168
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,919
It's another way of relating to his story that he said burn the manuscript.

169
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:33,839
Maybe he knew that it was propaganda, and maybe he regretted that he had written this sort of propaganda thing about Augustus.

170
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,919
And wants to say, in a cryptic way, don't take all this.

171
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,039
There's anything in the story.

172
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:39,999
That would be wonderful.

173
00:17:39,999 --> 00:17:43,759
Yeah, I think that would be, that's also maybe another way of understanding this anecdote.

174
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:46,240
It's like, why does he suddenly leave for Greece?

175
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:55,919
Why is this sudden departure that maybe he wasn't so happy with?

176
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:02,959
He maybe saw that this was a kind of overweening expansion on Augustus' part.

177
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:07,600
But in any case, in spite of not believing it, he wrote a work of art.

178
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:19,839
To be a true work of art, it has to express, articulate the understanding of being of the people that it's written.

179
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,319
This is what I'm going to talk about next.

180
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:28,319
It's going to express the understanding of being, whether Virgil knows it or not.

181
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,999
I mean, understands it or not.

182
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:45,319
So he makes a work of art, even if it's propaganda, because it does capture and express and articulate and help form a certain Roman understanding of being.

183
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,400
Okay, thanks, Beatrice.

184
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,800
Beatrice will be back for an encore next time to talk about Dido.

185
00:18:51,800 --> 00:19:08,120
But now it's my turn to talk, to put this not only in historical perspective, which Beatrice has done, but to put it in ontological Heideggerian understanding of being perspective, which is what I'm now going to do.

186
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:17,880
If once I get all these things in my pocket and understand whether they're all doing what they're supposed to be doing, this one doesn't seem to be doing anything, but let's hope it is.

187
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:48,040
Okay, when I left off last time, it was to make sure that I have told you the understandings of being of Thesis and Poesis, the Odyssey one, and contrasting it with the Orestea one, and saying that there was the understanding of being of Homer and the Homeric Greeks was that, and I didn't put it very clearly, but I want to say it again because I think I can say it clearer now.

188
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:54,279
Well, the kind of thing that was important to them was the kind of thing that whooshed up.

189
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:59,239
So I made a list of the kinds of things that whoosh up that they cared a lot about.

190
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:02,199
You'll see that Virgil doesn't care about any of them.

191
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:09,880
Passions, wild passions, like Aphrodite, hero ferocity, like Aries.

192
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:15,160
Wild animals, I think they thought were powerful, important things.

193
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:21,919
I don't know why I think so, except that there is a long story of a hunt and the killing of a something or other in the Iliad.

194
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,360
What's on the shield?

195
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:23,760
I forget.

196
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,439
Does he tell a boar?

197
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:33,280
And Odysseus has a wound from, remember, that the nurse sees, oh, there's another whole hunting story.

198
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:35,679
So I think hunting wild animals is important.

199
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,600
Certainly, because they go to sea, storms are very important.

200
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,799
And the thing is, and moods, didn't I write that down?

201
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,759
That's odd.

202
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:51,840
I mean, of course, moods are very, well, it comes under passions, I guess, but they don't have to always be erotic, swept away passions.

203
00:20:51,840 --> 00:21:02,880
Moods are important, and all of them whoosh up and are, and this is what I also wanted to say, I said they well up, but I didn't use another phrase which seems to me important.

204
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,719
They're all overwhelming.

205
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:06,319
That's the whole point.

206
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:15,759
Storms, passions, ferocious fighters like Achilles are all overwhelming, and that's what impressed the Greeks.

207
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:19,039
And that's what Homer reflects in his understanding of being.

208
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,640
And their response was, they knew it was out of their control.

209
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:30,799
They admired all these things that were out of their control, and their response was wonder in the face of these things that are out of their control.

210
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:55,040
I already said that, but I wanted to say it again because now I want to go on to the next understanding of being, which is the one in the Iliad, but a little, I mean, the Aeneid, but just a little to keep sort of connecting to what Beatrice said too, so why we're reading this at all.

211
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:06,160
And not only is it a work of art and an important point on the way from gods to single god, because polytheism is gone.

212
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:14,679
If Augustus is the, or at least by far, I guess there are still other gods, but he's clearly the top god in this.

213
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:20,919
But there's more sort of mundane reason why we're reading it.

214
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:26,120
And it's important just to tell you that you notice we're only taking up little pieces of it.

215
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,400
That's not a good thing to do with works of art.

216
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:36,759
But there just isn't time to read the whole thing the way we could read the whole of the Odyssey and the whole Orestea.

217
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:51,239
And so we're really treating it as a step toward understanding the next big work of art, which is the divine comedy, which is certainly the focus of the understanding of the next understanding of being.

218
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:55,880
And we'll read a lot more of the divine comedy, though it's so big we can't read all of it.

219
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,799
So we're reading Virgil for three.

220
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:12,279
Oh, and since we're reading Virgil in this very kind of transitional way, we can't read it looking very carefully at every sentence and trying to translate or re-translate it so that it makes one very coherent picture.

221
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:14,600
We'll do that again when we get to Dante.

222
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:23,959
What we want to now is get this overall sense in this lecture and the next one and maybe half of the next one.

223
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:27,239
That's all we've got of what's going on here.

224
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:50,599
And what's going on here for us is a new understanding of being, which is what I'm going to talk about in a moment, a preparation for the geography of the underworld, which is, we've already seen a version of where the people go after they're dead in the Odyssey and how Homer thinks of death and mortality and the afterlife.

225
00:23:50,600 --> 00:24:08,480
Now we need to be able to see how Virgil thinks about it because that sets up this poem, The Inferno, which is this amazing Dante whole book about the total details of mortality and the life of the people after you're dead.

226
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:12,239
We've got to, this is once you need this to get to Dante.

227
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:18,559
And as you'll see, Virgil shows up as the second, this main character in the Inferno.

228
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:24,479
He's Dante's guide, so it helps to know who Virgil is when you get there.

229
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:30,400
And we read it, as I say, as a step toward monotheism.

230
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:40,320
It's certainly the only, sort of one way to put it, I'm trying to figure out how to put it, how it's more monotheistic than the, certainly, of course, than the Odyssey.

231
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,280
But why more monotheistic than the Orestea?

232
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,280
Well, because there are lots of gods around.

233
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,800
All the Greek gods are still around.

234
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,880
You'd think it might be polytheism.

235
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:55,759
But the only God that really matters is Augustus when you get to the Aeneid.

236
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:11,279
And that's going to set you up for the supreme being, who's more than the emperor and the first citizen, namely the kind of God that we're familiar with from the Christian, Judeo-Christian story.

237
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,279
And so we can see this as a step in that direction.

238
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,599
Okay, now I have to look because I'm changing things around.

239
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:33,199
Okay, so I think I ended last time, as I can best remember, that saying, try to, as you read, try to see what the understanding of being is in the Aeneid.

240
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:46,360
What is the basic characteristic of what is the most important thing in life, and what is the basic, or things, and what is the basic characteristic of those things?

241
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:53,640
Just as whooshing up is what's the basic characteristic of these things which whoosh up are the most important for the Greeks.

242
00:25:53,640 --> 00:26:04,839
And Poesis, just to remind you, is the expressive order of bringing out things at their best and the kind of things you nurture and cultivate.

243
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,959
It could have been friendship you nurture and cultivate, but it isn't.

244
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:13,959
It's citizenship that in the Aeneid, finally, you nurture and cultivate.

245
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:21,079
But it's not the kind of citizenship of a Roman representative kind of citizenship.

246
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:27,479
It's this total love of Athens where you want to bring everything out at its best.

247
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:29,000
That's what Athens stands for.

248
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:30,279
That's Poesis.

249
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:32,039
That's the expressive order.

250
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:34,600
If you repress things, they become bad.

251
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,479
I don't think I even said this very clearly, so I'll say it again.

252
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:42,599
If you repress things, according to Aeschylus, they become bad, like the Furies.

253
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:52,199
But if you let them all come out, it's sort of like hippie dungeon, let it all hang out, then you let everything come forth, it will come forth at its best.

254
00:26:52,199 --> 00:26:57,719
And all you have to do is help by nurturing it, by cultivating it, by bringing it forth.

255
00:26:57,719 --> 00:27:00,599
And that's the understanding of being.

256
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:08,039
And then I said at the end last time, I think, and what do you think the understanding of being is for Virgil?

257
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:17,079
And remember, now Virgil is writing a work of art not because he's trying to glamorize and promote Augustine.

258
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,439
I mean, that's what he's paid to do and fed and lodged to do.

259
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:22,640
And that's what he thinks he's doing.

260
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:29,039
And that's what he may have doubts about doing if that funny dream passage is read in that ambiguous way.

261
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:34,479
But what he's surely doing is expressing something that all these Romans share.

262
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:49,360
And in articulating it, in expressing it, he's focusing it and holding it up to the people and making it even more the way it is.

263
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,039
That's what he shares with Homer.

264
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,880
That's what he shares with Aeschylus.

265
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:59,280
And that's what saves it, whether or not because, what saves it is that's what it does.

266
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,599
It shows the Romans what they're up to.

267
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,919
And they treated it like a work of art.

268
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,799
They understood that.

269
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:10,160
They apparently learned it by heart.

270
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,559
I was thinking as I was writing this, that seems to be a kind of test of works of art.

271
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,919
The Greeks learned the Iliad and Odyssey by heart.

272
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,880
These guys learned the Aeneid.

273
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,479
The Christians, the really Christian Christians, could recite the Bible by heart.

274
00:28:26,479 --> 00:28:41,759
It seems that if there is some work that is the articulation of what you're up to, you feel required or drawn to learn it and say it over and appeal to it on all sorts of situations.

275
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,839
To understand what you should be doing.

276
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,800
And then they went even further and they built shrines to it.

277
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,640
They really apparently thought of it.

278
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,439
I mean, the Aeschylus people already made it a, you could perform it every year.

279
00:28:55,479 --> 00:29:01,519
And the Homer people obviously recited it at their very best parties, probably every year.

280
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:06,439
And this one, they actually somehow put the book in and worshipped it.

281
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,279
I don't know what that means exactly, but I read that they built shrines to it.

282
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,559
And what's going on in it?

283
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,600
Well, I'm changing my plan.

284
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,999
How are you going to find out?

285
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:24,439
I think I said this at the end last time, too, that Virgil's never going to tell you.

286
00:29:24,439 --> 00:29:33,319
The understanding of being in here is production, which is what I think, what Heidegger says it is, and what I think I can show you it is.

287
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,319
He doesn't know that.

288
00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:41,959
Heidegger talks about the necessary blindness of the great artist who's producing a work of art.

289
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:44,439
Why is that necessary blindness?

290
00:29:44,439 --> 00:29:49,640
Because he's so inside the understanding of being, and he's so sensitive to it.

291
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,880
It's like a goldfish in water.

292
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,759
You can't see it if you're a great artist.

293
00:29:54,759 --> 00:30:04,519
And the more you're open to it, and totally immersed in it, and unable to see it, the greater your ability to express it is going to be.

294
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:06,839
But of course, you won't know it.

295
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,360
So now I want to just read you a passage.

296
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,479
And I said, well, if he doesn't know it, how are you going to find out?

297
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:16,039
You can't expect him to tell you.

298
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,919
And you can't.

299
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:21,079
You've got to look, particularly at the similes.

300
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,439
There, he's copying Homer by long.

301
00:30:24,439 --> 00:30:27,479
It was like such and such and such and such and such and such.

302
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:32,039
He took that over, presumably quite consciously, from Homer.

303
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,360
But the similes are very different.

304
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:50,880
I haven't gone back and looked at the similes in the Iliad and Odyssey, but I bet if you lined them up with the ones in here, you'd find them just strikingly different, and each of them hopefully giving you the Frusis and the production story.

305
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,160
But listen to, look at this.

306
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:57,120
Just on page 16, and this is where you might have gotten.

307
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,400
How many, how far have you gotten?

308
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,799
You had to write your papers, I know, and get them in yesterday.

309
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,360
How many have managed to read the first book?

310
00:31:03,999 --> 00:31:05,120
That's good, that's good.

311
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,839
And book four?

312
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,439
Okay, well, try for sure.

313
00:31:09,439 --> 00:31:13,840
You've got to read book four for next time, and hopefully, book six.

314
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,880
But Beatrice is going to talk about book four.

315
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,559
That's the Dido story.

316
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,959
Well, here, looking in the middle of 16, you find this funny thing.

317
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:33,759
He sees, and he thinks it's marvelous, all the activity and the enormous buildings, it says, six down, which were once mere huts.

318
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:43,439
And he's looking at what Dido has done in governing, what's the name of the place?

319
00:31:43,439 --> 00:31:44,319
Not Carthage.

320
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,200
That's its real name.

321
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:45,759
But what's it?

322
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:46,799
Is it called Carthage?

323
00:31:46,959 --> 00:31:47,919
Is it Carthage here?

324
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,679
A Carthage.

325
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:50,080
Okay.

326
00:31:50,080 --> 00:32:09,999
So in the middle of the page, just as the bees in early summer busy beneath the sunlight through the flowered meadows, when some lead on their full-grown young, and others press out the flowing honey, pack the cells with sweet nectar, or gather in the burdens of those returning, some in columns drive the drones, the lazy herd, out of the hives.

327
00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:13,679
The work is fervent, and the fragrant honey is sweet with thine.

328
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,120
Now, why does he like the bees so much?

329
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:19,280
Why not ants say?

330
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,319
They are equally busy and organized.

331
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,839
There's something very attractive about all this activity from the bees.

332
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:30,799
Can you get a feel for what it is?

333
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,320
I think it's because they produce something.

334
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,880
They produce honey.

335
00:32:35,439 --> 00:32:37,880
It's not just that they're busy running around.

336
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:44,599
It's not even that they're busy running around in a very organized way, though that's part of the, that's necessary.

337
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,559
It's that all this activity produces this fragrant honey.

338
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,200
And that should interest him.

339
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,560
You'll see more, more similes later.

340
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:59,720
But for the moment, that's what I just wanted to jump to.

341
00:32:59,719 --> 00:33:01,479
Now let me see where I am.

342
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,800
And Virgil is really making a product, too.

343
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,320
I mean, he's making what people nowadays call a deliverable.

344
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:18,280
He's got this deal, and he's going to produce the Aeneid, going to produce a work which satisfies certain descriptions.

345
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:20,199
But you don't feel that Homer did that.

346
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:22,519
You don't even feel that maybe there wasn't even a Homer.

347
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:30,360
Maybe the Odyssey just welled up in the sort of folk story and put together bit by bit and finally written down.

348
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:36,999
And you certainly, and you don't feel, I think that Aeschylus is producing a deliverable.

349
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,439
Because, why not?

350
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:47,320
Because you feel that sort of Aeschylus is out of control, that he's writing wild stuff that you can hardly understand.

351
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,040
I think probably he can hardly understand.

352
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:58,360
He's just so overwhelmed and filled with excitement and love of Athens that he just writes from it.

353
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:06,520
But you feel that this is a job and that Virgil is doing it very conscientiously.

354
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,160
And so let's see now else.

355
00:34:09,319 --> 00:34:26,960
He's producing something and I wrote here too that Aeschylus is trying to cultivate something, something he's that's already i i i achieved and exciting and he's just helping it come to the full understanding of the people.

356
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,239
You I think I don't know whether you feel that about the Aeneid.

357
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,399
I think the Aeneid is more programmatic.

358
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,719
The Aeneid is trying to produce something.

359
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:40,879
It's trying to convince the people that their highest good is to be dutiful citizens.

360
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,959
Paietas, this new virtue.

361
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,400
He's trying to sell it.

362
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:49,519
And they've already got it, because you couldn't sell it to them if they didn't already have it.

363
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:58,799
But he's trying to articulate it and sort of, in a way, more produce it than just reflect it, I think.

364
00:34:58,799 --> 00:35:00,880
But I could be just reading that in.

365
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:06,800
But I'm going to go on now and talk more about productivity.

366
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,319
By the way, you notice it's beginning to sound more like us as you go along.

367
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:26,160
I mean, certainly Frisus doesn't sound like us, overwhelmed, finding the things that overwhelm us and we cannot control the most wonderful, awesome things as what is the really best things.

368
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:32,400
And nurturing and cultivating doesn't seem to be our main thing either.

369
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:35,920
Producing is getting much, much closer.

370
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:51,520
At the end, before I at the very end, I'll try to say there is still an important difference between producing for the Romans and for us, but because we haven't got their understanding of being, there's at least one in between, maybe two.

371
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,120
I mentioned that, and we've got to do creation.

372
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,640
Notice that production and creation have a lot in common.

373
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:04,719
It's just that creation is a production by one supreme being who did who does the whole production.

374
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:09,479
And then after that, there's subjects and objects, and that's off in the future.

375
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,679
So here we are.

376
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:25,480
Virgil admires these ants in a way that the important thing I think for him is that they're organized and that they're producing something.

377
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:45,560
It's not a question of getting in tune with the situation nor bringing things out in their best, but it's producing a monumental product, monuments to themselves, so to speak, of what they're doing.

378
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:55,080
And now we can look at, if you look at, well, I don't think I want to do that yet, just a second.

379
00:36:55,399 --> 00:37:00,040
Okay, no, it's not, it's not, I want to give out a pen.

380
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:22,679
Okay, it's, it's, you get what really is going on is dominating, governing, and imposing order that produces something, namely stable institutions, stable monuments, they're stable citizens, and so forth.

381
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:29,160
But I want to talk about this notion of dominating, governing, and imposing order.

382
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:36,519
That it sounds when you produce something, yeah, I've mentioned this once, but think about this.

383
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:51,120
When you produce something, one way to look at it, which is the way I think Virgil looks at it, is you impose order, shape, a form on matter.

384
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:54,160
Matter is just stuff lying there.

385
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:59,120
It doesn't have in it something that you could bring out.

386
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:07,280
There's no place for this expressive poesis, nurturing, cultivating, letting come forth.

387
00:38:07,279 --> 00:38:16,080
My favorite way of understanding it is to ask yourself at each stage, what's the most perfect kind of entity in the world?

388
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,960
I gave you a list of good ones for the Greeks.

389
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:26,240
And there's these people who all love Athens, for Aeschylus.

390
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:37,679
But now, what's the perfect picture of just a, well, a kind of caricature, but I think it'll help you understand this.

391
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:48,079
I think you could say that their model of production, which has got to do with this business of dominating and ordering, is imposing form on matter.

392
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,640
I'll give you lots of similes that say that.

393
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,120
And the model for that is bricks.

394
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:58,960
I think if you, the bricks are just fine because there's just this mud.

395
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:12,319
It has no innate structure to bring out, like craftsmen bring out the cabinet in the wood or they bring out the sculptor, the statue in the marble.

396
00:39:12,319 --> 00:39:14,320
There's nothing to bring out in mud.

397
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:18,960
It's, if anything, their mud is sort of recalcitrant to any form.

398
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:23,280
Not rebellious, but at least not any help.

399
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:25,679
And therefore, you impose the form on it.

400
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:27,440
You make it into bricks.

401
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:28,879
And what do you do with bricks?

402
00:39:28,879 --> 00:39:31,759
Well, there's nothing intrinsically to do with bricks.

403
00:39:31,759 --> 00:39:38,039
If you could build roads, as you know, the Romans built roads all over the known world and aqueducts.

404
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,319
Some of them are still around.

405
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,359
They're so well built.

406
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:45,000
So you build and monuments with your bricks.

407
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:55,959
And all of this is a way of getting, of producing something by imposing an order on what in itself doesn't have any order.

408
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,120
I mean, that's very important.

409
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,520
It's not an expressive order.

410
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,520
There's nothing to express.

411
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:29,000
It's more like a repressive order, except that its way of governing is somehow to get the unruly matter, which is, again, not really so much rebellious, it's just sort of, as I say, recalcitrant, it just hasn't got any form, to shape it up.

412
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:40,199
And the best statement of that I know, and I was going to save it till later, but I think I'll read it now, is on page six, because you ought to be able to see this in the gods.

413
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:42,359
And maybe I'll just skip to the gods.

414
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:42,759
Why not?

415
00:40:42,759 --> 00:40:43,399
Just a second.

416
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,239
Let me see if that's a good idea.

417
00:40:46,279 --> 00:40:49,239
Well, with one transition, but never mind page six.

418
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:54,599
Page three, because I'm going to talk in a minute about Zeus and Poseidon, and I don't want to read about them yet.

419
00:40:54,600 --> 00:41:10,280
But here's a god that we don't hear much about in Homer that has a big job of imposing form on somewhat crazy, disorganized matter.

420
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:15,320
And that's the job of King Aeolis at the middle of page three.

421
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:23,199
The enormous cave, King Aeolus, in his enormous cave, King Aeolis restrains the wrestling winds.

422
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:26,160
Restrains is a good word, not represses.

423
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:27,839
It's hard to find a right word.

424
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,040
I decided that the right word would be tames.

425
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:44,719
If you started with nourishing or cultivating, I thought about that as Aeschylus is feeling, then you need something that's not like that, but which is not repression either.

426
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:46,959
And taming is, I think, just the right word.

427
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,519
I don't know why I didn't ever write it into my notes here.

428
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:55,759
It just came to me in the middle of the night, and I didn't have a pen.

429
00:41:55,759 --> 00:42:01,920
Okay, so, and now you can see how what happens is, notice the next word in a minute.

430
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:08,079
He restrains the wrestling winds, loud hurricanes, he tames and sways them with chains and prison.

431
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,839
I mean, it's really sort of odd.

432
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,800
It's on the verge of repression all the time.

433
00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:23,199
But you don't think when you tame something that you're repressing it, but you're sort of keeping it from doing what it wants to do and making it do and produce what you want.

434
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:24,560
And that's what's happening here.

435
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,040
He tames and sways them with his chains and prison.

436
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,199
They rage in indignation at their cages.

437
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:31,199
The mountain answers with a mighty roar.

438
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:33,279
Lord Aeolus sits in his high citadel.

439
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:34,399
He holds his scepter.

440
00:42:34,399 --> 00:42:35,759
He soothes their souls.

441
00:42:35,759 --> 00:42:38,320
You see, they're getting all upset.

442
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:44,640
And his job, when you tame them, isn't like nurturing them and cultivating them.

443
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,080
He soothes their souls and calms their madness.

444
00:42:48,080 --> 00:43:00,000
Taming and calming, you'll see over and over in the metaphors, is what the what Virgil, and thereby speaking for all the Romans without knowing it, admires.

445
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,839
And let's read again.

446
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:11,879
But fearing that the all-evil father, fearing that, namely that they would get wild, the all-able father hid the winds within dark caverns, heaping over them high mountains.

447
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:14,439
They're close to repression.

448
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:23,480
And he assigned to them a king who should, by Jove's surely, understand just when to jail, when to command, when to set free, and so forth.

449
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,959
So you just have to keep thinking tames.

450
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:32,359
I mean, and taming is a way of imposing form on matter.

451
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:41,559
If you keep that in mind, and thereby producing something stable, productive, I mean, somehow useful.

452
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:47,240
I take it the winds are, when they get them under control right, do a good job of pushing the boats along.

453
00:43:47,799 --> 00:43:51,160
Okay, now I think I'm ready to see here.

454
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,160
Another thing I've got here is channeling things.

455
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:59,239
That seems to be another way of thought, like chaining, only in this case, taming.

456
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:05,640
You tame the winds, you channel the winds, and you govern them, you dominate them.

457
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:11,400
Now, I'm going to talk now about the gods, where this is all clearer.

458
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:13,880
So let's just go through the gods.

459
00:44:13,879 --> 00:44:20,039
Okay, Jupiter, that is Zeus, has now become Jupiter.

460
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:27,319
You all got copies of this thing that I handed out, which tells you that names of all these many names for Aeneas and many names for.

461
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,399
Would somebody come and help me pass?

462
00:44:29,399 --> 00:44:31,080
How many need these?

463
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,199
Okay, wow.

464
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:34,039
It's on the website here.

465
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,079
I've got lots of them.

466
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:43,640
It's got on one side how to write a paper, but on the other side, it's got all the names for Troy, all the names for Rome, all the names for gods.

467
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,240
So I'm going to go on talking.

468
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:47,960
So we're looking at Jupiter now.

469
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:52,239
And he is taken over from Zeus.

470
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:56,719
But he's only taken over from Zeus in the sense that he has the position Zeus has.

471
00:44:50,759 --> 00:44:57,919
He's the head god.

472
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:06,880
But his job is totally different, as you'd expect, since the gods are going to be expressive of the understanding of being.

473
00:45:06,879 --> 00:45:08,719
He's going to have a different job.

474
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:26,560
Zeus's job was protecting strangers, going between worlds, a fascinating job, one that doesn't seem very important to us, but seems very important to the Greeks of Homeric time, given their polytheism and all the worlds that they want to visit and understand.

475
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:31,919
So Jupiter is the king and the father.

476
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,800
His specific job is commanding and governing.

477
00:45:36,799 --> 00:45:43,679
That means controlling whatever would tend to get out of control, and that's again taming and so forth.

478
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,839
Just the middle of nine, who's talking?

479
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:48,960
I don't know.

480
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,439
Oh, Venus, her bright eyes brimmed and tearful, speaks to Aeneas.

481
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,080
Okay.

482
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,600
Oh, you who with eternal rule, no, to Jupiter.

483
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:01,359
Oh, you who with eternal rule command and govern the events.

484
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,359
That's where I get these words I want.

485
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:04,399
Govern the events.

486
00:46:04,399 --> 00:46:07,999
And you can see that Aolus was governing the winds.

487
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:12,879
Govern the events of gods and men and terrify them with your thunderbolt.

488
00:46:12,879 --> 00:46:17,040
With great offense has made Odysseus and so forth and so forth.

489
00:46:17,279 --> 00:46:20,160
Now, it's really interesting.

490
00:46:20,399 --> 00:46:32,399
The thunderbolt comes from the Greeks, of course, from the Homeric Greeks, but they thought, I take it, that it was overwhelming and exciting.

491
00:46:32,399 --> 00:46:46,760
I mean, if you've ever been in a thunderstorm, which you poor people haven't, if you've come and been raised in California, or not a real thunderstorm, like in the Middle West where I come from, but if you've been in a real super thunderstorm, it's wonderful, it's awesome, it's just terrific.

492
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:50,040
But I don't think that's what they think.

493
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,440
They just think the thunderstorms are terrifying.

494
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:03,960
And where is it for Zeus having a thunderbolt is to do something really fusus-like, something overwhelming.

495
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:11,879
I think I don't know why Jupiter has a thunderbolt, because it doesn't have anything to do with his job as governing.

496
00:47:11,879 --> 00:47:26,280
It's just something sort of dragged in, it seems to me, from the Greeks, and their reaction is not awe, but terror, which means they're just, they think it's frightening, all this storm going on.

497
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:38,199
And the Romans are going to be, skipping down about ten lines, born and from the blood of Choicer, rise up as rulers over sea and land.

498
00:47:38,199 --> 00:47:39,719
That's the governing again.

499
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:42,120
That's the imposing order on things.

500
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:59,320
That's going to be, that's one of their job descriptions: to organize, tame, govern all everything so that it becomes peaceful and stable and productive.

501
00:47:59,799 --> 00:48:01,800
I think that's their idea.

502
00:48:01,799 --> 00:48:05,880
If you ask them, what do you want out of life, they would say something like that.

503
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:13,319
And Jupiter's not sort of behind everything in an ontological way, like in Aeschylus.

504
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:15,960
It looks like Zeus is behind everything.

505
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:24,719
It looks like he's a specific entity or being, namely, like a king, and he commands and governs.

506
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:30,240
That's a specific way of being behind everything, is you govern and control everything.

507
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:31,999
And he governs the cosmos.

508
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,640
That's what we just saw.

509
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,080
He calms and orders things that get out of control.

510
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:42,560
Look on page 10, the beginning of that long paragraph.

511
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,919
But then he smiled upon her.

512
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:49,920
Jupiter, father of men and gods, just as he calms the heavens and the storms, and so forth.

513
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:53,679
And he's constantly doing that.

514
00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:05,999
You can see another one away on 158, which you will never have in your assignments, but I can just skip to it, because it's got taming in it again.

515
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:23,120
Whenever you see taming in it, mark it in your text and light up, because I think the fundamental feel for being and what people's job, what a job description for human beings and even for gods is, comes out whenever he says taming.

516
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:27,199
At the bottom of 158, about 10 lines from the bottom.

517
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:30,959
For other people, we'll no doubt, who's talking here?

518
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,639
I don't know.

519
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:40,240
Somebody explaining the future of Rome.

520
00:49:40,399 --> 00:49:43,199
They go back to the beginning of the quotes.

521
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:44,480
Who is he?

522
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,679
At the bottom of 153, no?

523
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,880
And when he saw Aeneas cross the meadow, he stretched out his hands.

524
00:49:52,879 --> 00:49:54,000
Who sees Aeneas?

525
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,880
I'm on page 153, trying to find out.

526
00:49:56,879 --> 00:49:59,039
Anchises, okay, his father.

527
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:03,120
This is Aeneas' father talking, I believe, at the bottom of 158.

528
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,120
I'm going to write it down.

529
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,759
If it turns out to be wrong, tell me.

530
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:30,519
So, Aeneas' father says about 10 lines from the bottom: for other people will, I do not doubt, still cast their bronze to breathe with softer features, that is, make beautiful bronze statues, draw out the marble living, out of the marble living lines, make beautiful marble statues, plead causes better, trace the ways of the heaven, and tell the rising constellations.

531
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,199
I mean, do astronomy.

532
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,199
It's the Greeks.

533
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,080
That's this sort of inferiority complex.

534
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,840
It's saying, in effect, other people can do what the Greeks did.

535
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:45,400
But yours will be, and now comes their thing, the rulership of nations.

536
00:50:45,399 --> 00:50:55,160
Remember, Roman, these will be your arts, to teach the people the ways of peace to those you conquer, to spare defeated people, tame the proud.

537
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,719
And that's the same, the story again.

538
00:50:57,719 --> 00:51:02,679
So I think, and you could say, I'm just saying in many, many ways, order is absolute.

539
00:51:02,679 --> 00:51:08,760
Everything makes sense in terms of how you set up and maintain order.

540
00:51:08,759 --> 00:51:17,000
You can see that that would be a job for the citizens of a country that did set up and maintain order for a thousand years.

541
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:24,120
And a terribly, terribly stable, administratively organized country.

542
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:29,880
It always strikes me that in some ways they're like us, if it helps you understand it any.

543
00:51:29,879 --> 00:51:32,520
But in some ways, in this way, they're like China.

544
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:39,560
China is this big, administrative, stable entity that lasted a thousand years.

545
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,600
I don't know, I don't think they had an understanding of being.

546
00:51:42,839 --> 00:51:46,519
But not being Chinese and knowing their great texts, I don't know.

547
00:51:46,520 --> 00:52:02,640
It isn't, not every country or culture has, in fact, not every country has one, you know, privileged understanding of being, that is, everything at its best or serves something or other.

548
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:15,040
But in fact, according to Heidegger, ours is the only culture, for better or for worse, and finally he thinks it's for worse, has a unified understanding of being forming.

549
00:52:15,279 --> 00:52:21,360
We're watching it form, until it gets just one story about what it's all about.

550
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:25,759
And I doubt if the Chinese have it.

551
00:52:25,759 --> 00:52:28,080
Certainly the Japanese don't have it.

552
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:32,000
It's easier to see in Japan that it's polytheistic.

553
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,519
I don't know enough about Chinese.

554
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:39,679
If anybody knows about the Chinese and how they relate to this, come and talk to me about it.

555
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:40,960
I'd love to know.

556
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,279
But here, order is absolute.

557
00:52:43,279 --> 00:52:48,000
Everything makes sense in terms of setting up and maintaining order.

558
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,359
And if you ask, then why is order so important?

559
00:52:52,399 --> 00:52:58,160
Well, partly, I think, that it hasn't been evident from these passages to produce things.

560
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,039
You need order.

561
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,960
That's where the B's come in.

562
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,840
But partly, I think the answer is order is just a good thing for its own sake.

563
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:08,080
That's what it is when you hit rock bottom.

564
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,840
You hit the understanding of being.

565
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:22,320
Aeschylus can't tell you why being an expressive order that lets things come out and nourishes them is what everybody should be doing and what the country should be doing.

566
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:26,640
That seems so obvious they don't even see it as a question.

567
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,120
And so, but so, but that's how it is.

568
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:35,199
And now, okay, so much for Zoom.

569
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:41,640
Now, Neptune, back to page six, where I started and then I decided not to read it.

570
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:45,960
Now, Neptune is the brother of Zeus.

571
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:52,360
And, of course, you've got to keep this in mind to see the striking difference and how illuminating it is.

572
00:53:52,359 --> 00:54:03,800
Neptune was one of the most disruptive gods, the gods of the storms whooshing up, of nature, overwhelming and out of control.

573
00:54:03,799 --> 00:54:07,719
Well, you take over, that was Poseidon.

574
00:54:07,719 --> 00:54:08,600
I said Neptune.

575
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,560
Poseidon was that in Homer.

576
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:19,480
Neptune, which has the job Poseidon has, of being the god of the sea, what do you expect?

577
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,319
Well, have you been following him?

578
00:54:21,319 --> 00:54:24,920
What do you think Poseidon's job is as god of the sea?

579
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,679
To stir up storms?

580
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:27,719
Hmm?

581
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,240
You think so?

582
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:30,120
Yeah.

583
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:31,000
What?

584
00:54:32,359 --> 00:54:34,279
Yes, to calm the storms.

585
00:54:34,279 --> 00:54:36,040
His job is just the opposite.

586
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,719
It's like almost like a joke.

587
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:43,479
Neptune is running around in a little carriage with a trident on wheels.

588
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,040
It's sort of a little like Disneyland.

589
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
But where was he?

590
00:54:49,799 --> 00:54:50,359
What is this?

591
00:54:50,359 --> 00:54:52,760
It's where he's got his little cart.

592
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,160
Neptune, I don't know.

593
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,039
It's not there.

594
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:56,919
Maybe it'll show up.

595
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,439
Anyway, what I want to read isn't that.

596
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:02,840
On 6th line 2007, 207.

597
00:55:02,839 --> 00:55:07,239
He stills the sea and guides along the waters on light wheels.

598
00:55:07,239 --> 00:55:12,839
Oh, there he is, running around with his chariot on the waters, leveling it into calm.

599
00:55:13,399 --> 00:55:18,359
And just as often when a crowd of people is rocked, and now here's another version of it.

600
00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:20,199
Pay attention to the simile.

601
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:47,520
Like when a crowd of people is rocked by a rebellion and the rabble rage in their minds, and firebrands and stones fly fast, for fury finds its weapons, if by chance they see a man remarkable for righteousness and service, piety, duty, they are silent and stand attentively, and he controls their passions by his words and cools their spirit so that all the clamor of the sea subsides.

602
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,000
So you get a double story there.

603
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:59,600
Just as Neptune calms the sea, so the great statesman calms the crowd, and it's always the same story.

604
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:13,520
They're sort of disordered and recalcitrant and unruly, and somebody comes along and puts, calms them down, tames them, governs them, orders them.

605
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,759
And that's what...

606
00:56:15,759 --> 00:56:26,560
And both, so Poseidon and Zeus have become people in charge, or gods in charge of ordering.

607
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,199
And now, Venus is another funny one.

608
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:30,960
This is the last one I'm going to talk about.

609
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,960
The same switch.

610
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:36,480
Venus, if we can, is Aphrodite, remember.

611
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:54,400
And Aphrodite is the goddess of mad passion, of something so overwhelming that it can make Helen leave home and abandon her Menelaus and her son and so forth.

612
00:56:54,399 --> 00:56:58,000
Now, Venus, just like every other one, what would you expect?

613
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,040
Is Venus going to be the goddess of mad passion?

614
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,519
You can already see it starting to happen in Aespylus.

615
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,920
Remember, what's Venus' job there?

616
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,800
The sweetness of married love.

617
00:57:09,799 --> 00:57:15,400
That's already a big step out of Homeric Greece into Poasis.

618
00:57:15,399 --> 00:57:29,640
But Venus gets even more, and you could say literally, domesticated by the next one around, where she's just the goddess of domesticity, of the family, calm and and serene, presumably.

619
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,319
So here comes Venus.

620
00:57:32,279 --> 00:57:36,920
To begin with, though, all of this very interesting stuff happening on 47.

621
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:40,840
How would you think that the Virgil would feel about Helen?

622
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:48,360
Do you think he would think she was peerless among women because she managed to run off when the overwhelming overwhelmed her?

623
00:57:48,759 --> 00:57:49,239
No.

624
00:57:49,239 --> 00:57:50,679
He thinks she's awful.

625
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:51,399
She's terrible.

626
00:57:51,399 --> 00:57:53,719
She's caused all this disaster.

627
00:57:53,719 --> 00:58:11,160
At the middle of 47, about eight lines into the new paragraph, for she in the terror of the Trojans set against her for the fall of Pergamos, which is Troy, and the Danans, which are the Greeks, vengeance and anger that she, Helen, is afraid of all this.

628
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:14,199
And the anger of her abandoned husband, stop a minute.

629
00:58:14,839 --> 00:58:17,880
According to Homer, was her husband angry?

630
00:58:18,359 --> 00:58:21,719
That's the weird passage that I come back to again and again.

631
00:58:21,719 --> 00:58:25,160
He said that it was a great story how she left him for ten years.

632
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:32,040
And then when they're in bed together, Homer says the lying beside him was Helen peerless among women.

633
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,560
Well, you wouldn't know it here.

634
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:41,480
She, the common fury of Troy and of her homeland, she had hid herself crouching, a hated thing, beside the altars.

635
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:45,400
And his soul, skipped to the bottom, was filled with vengeful fire.

636
00:58:45,399 --> 00:58:55,280
So Aeneas is now getting out of control and mad at Helen for having gotten out of control.

637
00:58:55,279 --> 00:58:56,239
And so it goes on.

638
00:58:50,040 --> 00:59:17,600
And carried off at the bottom of 47 by my mad mind, I was still blurting out these words when, with such brightness as if I had never seen my gracious mother, that's Aphrodite, Venus, stood there before me, and across the night she gleamed with pure light, unmistaken goddess, as lovely and as tall, and so forth and so forth.

639
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:21,920
And she caught his right hand fast and spoke these words.

640
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:27,759
This is based on the Iliad where Achilles is losing his temper.

641
00:59:27,759 --> 00:59:33,440
I mean, the beginning of the Iliad, I've said this before, the very beginning is about the wrath of Achilles.

642
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,120
Achilles is losing his temper and about to kill Agamemnon.

643
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:48,639
And Athena comes up behind him and grabs him by his ponytail, by his long hair, and keeps him from doing it because it's not the appropriate thing to do in a situation, kill the commander of the troops.

644
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:55,759
So here, she grabs his hand and spoke these words: My son, what bitterness has kindled this frantic anger?

645
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:56,799
Why this madness?

646
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,759
Why all this care?

647
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:01,199
What of all you care for me?

648
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:02,319
Where has it gone?

649
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:07,199
Should you not first seek out your father, worn with years, and Chises, where you left him?

650
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:11,840
See if your wife, Crusea, and the boy, and Chises are still alive.

651
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:14,960
Go take care of your family, in effect, she says.

652
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:19,440
And that's what's become of the, it's turned completely the opposite.

653
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:30,399
Whereas mad love was disrupting the family, and then it got to be at least still sort of erotic and between a man and a wife, the sweetness between man and a wife.

654
01:00:30,399 --> 01:00:32,879
Now it's got, as I say, domesticated.

655
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:38,199
Venus of all things is the god of a stable family.

656
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:41,080
But that's all, of course, what you'd expect.

657
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:43,239
I'm skipping to catch up with myself here.

658
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,079
Then why don't you all think of some question or objection while I'm reading this?

659
01:00:48,040 --> 01:01:00,360
Yeah, I'm just saying how strange it is that Aphrodite, of all people, as Venus, should show up in the role of calming emotions and getting them under control.

660
01:01:00,359 --> 01:01:03,080
There is somebody whose job is that, Athena.

661
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:12,920
It's not that the Homeric Greeks don't think you should calm your emotions under the appropriate, you shouldn't go crazy if the situation isn't appropriate.

662
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:17,320
And she calms, but it's not, it's never Aphrodite's job.

663
01:01:17,319 --> 01:01:21,560
It's okay, that's fine.

664
01:01:21,879 --> 01:01:23,479
Now, does anybody have anything to say?

665
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:23,959
Good.

666
01:01:24,359 --> 01:01:27,960
I'm tired of talking by myself, yes?

667
01:01:28,359 --> 01:01:32,120
Helen and the photos are even more wrong.

668
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:32,919
Is that what you mean?

669
01:01:33,239 --> 01:01:36,279
But she's, well, because she's protecting Helen, you mean?

670
01:01:36,279 --> 01:01:37,640
Oh, yeah, that's fine.

671
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:40,520
That she should protect Helen isn't what bothers me.

672
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:43,959
It's that she should be the one to calm Aeneas.

673
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:44,919
I see what you mean, though.

674
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:48,679
If her job is protecting Helen, it's just she'll have to calm Aeneas.

675
01:01:48,679 --> 01:01:50,520
It's not her main business.

676
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:51,479
Well, that's good.

677
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:52,920
Let me think about that.

678
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:02,519
So she's her, of course, that doesn't give her any job except a kind of story job.

679
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,359
Her job is protecting Aeneas.

680
01:02:04,359 --> 01:02:09,320
I'm trying to see if I could figure out what sort of force she represents.

681
01:02:09,319 --> 01:02:16,440
And the force she represents, when we could tell when it's Aphrodite, is mad love.

682
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:20,039
And it seems to me that maybe I'm agreeing, I'm agreeing with you.

683
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,080
There isn't any force she represents.

684
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,319
It's just because it happens to be that she's the mother of Aeneas, right?

685
01:02:26,879 --> 01:02:28,800
Is that how she's related to him?

686
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:39,679
And naturally, she wants to why doesn't she just let him beat up on Helen and then go home?

687
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,439
But she's the mother of Helen.

688
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:42,719
I see.

689
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:43,119
Okay.

690
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:48,640
Venus, Aphrodite protects Helen, so it's natural that she's going to stop Aeneas.

691
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,679
Okay, Beatrice.

692
01:02:50,719 --> 01:02:52,399
She says, well, heart, you should do your duty.

693
01:02:54,239 --> 01:02:57,120
Yeah, does she say it in words, or are you just saying that's what it comes to?

694
01:02:57,199 --> 01:02:59,120
Yeah, do your duty as a as a father.

695
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:01,440
Yeah.

696
01:03:01,759 --> 01:03:02,160
Yeah.

697
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:02,719
Okay.

698
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:03,600
Yeah, that's right.

699
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:04,719
That's true.

700
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:08,640
She's being given this sort of Roman twist.

701
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,679
She's come up to tell him what to do.

702
01:03:11,679 --> 01:03:14,800
And what he's supposed to do is go do his duty.

703
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:18,960
That is, take care of his father, his wife, and his kids.

704
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,400
That's fine.

705
01:03:20,399 --> 01:03:24,559
That's, in fact, exactly the transition to what I want to talk about next.

706
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:31,279
So, but I would love to hear from, I mean, I'm happy to hear from my TAs and I learn from them.

707
01:03:31,279 --> 01:03:34,480
But I also like to hear from you people and learn from you.

708
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,120
Yeah.

709
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:50,559
And I thought that it wasn't particularly clear that it wasn't long, but she did.

710
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:56,480
Because first the story of his tells is mostly about Odysseus.

711
01:03:56,879 --> 01:04:05,359
And then she says, and she says now, well, um, the next story is because I had already realized that it was the 90 was built.

712
01:04:09,399 --> 01:04:16,439
And I thought that part of what you're talking about, or she's not a story about a gaze, that's what they were talking about.

713
01:04:16,759 --> 01:04:22,120
And then also part of what he's done in Peter Bennett, then she realized that you should go back to her husband.

714
01:04:25,799 --> 01:04:26,919
Well, that's all very good.

715
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:27,959
Can you hear him?

716
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:36,679
All of you that, I mean, maybe I'm getting too putting too much weight on this passage or misreading it.

717
01:04:36,679 --> 01:04:48,199
Mostly Helen talks at this dinner party about Odysseus, and she does say how she now wishes and regrets that she ran off and wishes she would go home, could go home.

718
01:04:48,199 --> 01:05:01,480
And I'm trying to put on that this claim, well, wild love, you know, calms down and gets boring, and Paris has gotten annoying and boring, running off to bed from the fighting all the time.

719
01:05:02,359 --> 01:05:16,679
But when Agamemnon says that's an admirable story, it could mean either or both, a good story about Odysseus, and a good story that you finally got tired of running off with him and came back to me.

720
01:05:17,319 --> 01:05:26,760
All I can do is, if it were only for that, I'd be in more trouble than at the end of the chapter, the last sentence practically is that Helen is peerless among women.

721
01:05:26,759 --> 01:05:36,840
You have to read that your way as saying, well, she's not peerless because she ran off with Paris, she's peerless because she finally saw that that was a mistake and came back.

722
01:05:36,839 --> 01:05:47,240
And I guess I want to say, no, I think it's because she's really open to all any kind of move.

723
01:05:47,239 --> 01:05:49,480
And I don't know how to settle it.

724
01:05:49,799 --> 01:05:53,839
There are some lines that seem to settle it, by the way, and I think I should bring them in next time.

725
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,119
Nobody noticed them and complained, or did I mention them in lecture?

726
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:09,120
There's about eight lines where Homer talks about how bad Helen is and how much disaster she's called, and what a, I forget a, isn't a whore, but it's a word like that, she was.

727
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:11,119
And do you remember that?

728
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:18,479
And it's late in the book, and I came across that and I thought, my goodness, my whole story about Helen is just wrong.

729
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,120
Homer does not think she's careless among women.

730
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:27,199
And I called up my student, Sean Kelly, who reads Greek, and asked him what's going on.

731
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:41,599
And we looked at the Greek, and I hadn't paid attention to a footnote which says these eight lines are obviously an interpolation, and since sometime by 200 BC, they've been considered not Homer.

732
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,120
And that's pretty amazing.

733
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,559
I can tell you where they are next time if I remember.

734
01:06:46,879 --> 01:06:52,640
So there's nothing in Homer, I think, that treats her as a bad woman.

735
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,800
But you're not saying that there is.

736
01:06:55,120 --> 01:07:01,040
The question is whether there's anything in Homer that treats her running off as admirable.

737
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:09,519
And I claim that it does, but I must admit that that's pretty strange and maybe wrong.

738
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:15,440
So nobody thinks it's condemnable, I think.

739
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:19,440
But those lines are interpolated for sure.

740
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:29,279
But being swept away as a super virtue that trumps everything, that's maybe, whether that's Homer or Dryfus, I can't promise to say.

741
01:07:29,279 --> 01:07:30,959
You look like you want to say more.

742
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:36,040
Homer says that she looks very much bigger than people.

743
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,160
No, you're right.

744
01:07:38,599 --> 01:07:39,559
That's right.

745
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:41,000
He's absolutely right.

746
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,479
I mean, I'm putting a spin on it.

747
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:46,279
It's the last of that chapter.

748
01:07:46,279 --> 01:07:53,479
But that chapter isn't about her running off and her speech and her saying that she regrets it and came back.

749
01:07:53,479 --> 01:07:55,559
That chapter is about all sorts of things.

750
01:07:55,559 --> 01:08:05,239
And peerless among women might just be she's the most beautiful woman in the world, which is what everybody's supposed to have already agreed to.

751
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:08,120
Peeralist means you have no equal.

752
01:08:08,199 --> 01:08:11,080
Could mean she has nobody equally beautiful.

753
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:13,399
So I would be so unhappy.

754
01:08:13,399 --> 01:08:26,359
I love my interpretation of it as showing how far out a completely fruitless culture could get of being open to whatever grabs you.

755
01:08:26,359 --> 01:08:33,719
But I must say, I have to put a lot of weight on it, and I don't know what to think.

756
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:37,319
But I worry about it.

757
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:46,599
And anybody who can help me, or either way, help me out of my misery, either show me that I have to just give this up, or show me that I can keep it.

758
01:08:46,599 --> 01:08:49,719
But I'm sort of always torn back and forth.

759
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:50,839
Yeah.

760
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:51,959
No.

761
01:08:52,279 --> 01:08:54,439
Well, I see.

762
01:08:54,439 --> 01:08:56,279
Well, I think I understand what you're saying.

763
01:08:56,279 --> 01:09:07,719
I don't want to say, it sounds much too Protestant or whether that's pure tanner or something to say you mean that we're going to condemn her as immoral or so for this.

764
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:10,519
Yeah, that doesn't seem right either.

765
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:13,239
There's nothing in the book that suggests that.

766
01:09:13,639 --> 01:09:16,519
But this is becoming, it's so contrasted with this.

767
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:25,920
This is such a kind of Puritan outrage, that this woman who would do this and cause a whole war and leave her husband and so forth.

768
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:27,759
It's not certainly that.

769
01:09:28,559 --> 01:09:30,879
Otherwise, Agamemnon wouldn't take her back.

770
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:35,840
I suppose I should at least put that down on the table as something I want to defend.

771
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:51,439
I mean, why couldn't he just say, well, you left me and the kid for ten years and now you come back to me after this war, you should be enslaved by the, by not, you know, queen on my island.

772
01:09:51,439 --> 01:10:09,599
So there's something about the fact that at least he accepts that giving in to this wild emotion and running off is not so bad that you couldn't forgive her for it, particularly if she regrets it.

773
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,040
We agree about that, probably.

774
01:10:11,519 --> 01:10:18,719
But you're saying, okay, but he's not saying you're a whore, you're a prostitute, you're just a disgusting, immoral person.

775
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:22,319
I wouldn't have you in my house and bed again, ever.

776
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:23,759
He's certainly not saying that.

777
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:30,000
She's the hostess at his dinner party, and everybody respects her.

778
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,840
So let me just keep repeating it.

779
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:37,599
I mean, there's nothing intrinsically wrong with just running off from your husband and kid.

780
01:10:37,599 --> 01:10:39,759
That seems clear.

781
01:10:40,559 --> 01:10:43,279
How to go on from there is less.

782
01:10:43,279 --> 01:10:44,319
You want to say more?

783
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,160
What happened to her, you mean?

784
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:47,599
It's like getting sick.

785
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:54,239
Yeah, but that would be a middle ground that she was swept away.

786
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:56,799
But you don't get blamed for being swept away.

787
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:57,920
I think that's sure.

788
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,000
So we better keep what's sure.

789
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:05,599
I try to push it to say not only you don't get blamed, but you actually get admired for being swept away.

790
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:16,759
That's pushing it, and as he says, but surely it's, and I see, I don't want to say it's like a disease because that gets it too much into the Dido story.

791
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:21,399
I mean, Dido's love, I don't know what Beatrice is going to do with it, I'm eager to hear.

792
01:11:21,399 --> 01:11:28,839
But Dido's love is described as a disease, and she can't help it, and we feel sorry about it.

793
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:33,880
But that isn't how you feel in Helen, that she was sick when she ran off at Paris.

794
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:35,719
That isn't quite right either.

795
01:11:36,519 --> 01:11:39,080
So it's all fascinating.

796
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:57,399
And anybody, people should come and talk to me in office hours about anything, but particularly about this, because I'm writing a paper with this guy, Sean, that I mention every once in a while on this very subject, which begins with the dinner party and what happens, how to understand what happened with Helen and Aphrodite.

797
01:11:57,399 --> 01:12:02,679
So anybody who's found any passages or had any ideas, I would love to hear them.

798
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:04,120
Yeah, Beatrice.

799
01:12:04,439 --> 01:12:05,799
As same as what I do?

800
01:12:10,519 --> 01:12:11,239
Ah, I see.

801
01:12:11,239 --> 01:12:12,120
What page are you on?

802
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:12,679
That's in.

803
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:13,160
That's it.

804
01:12:13,239 --> 01:12:13,800
That's interesting.

805
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:14,839
What page are you on?

806
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:15,559
What?

807
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:17,319
What page?

808
01:12:17,639 --> 01:12:18,519
Okay, that's in.

809
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:24,519
Go ahead Victor Queen and find her husband.

810
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,279
That's very interesting.

811
01:12:26,279 --> 01:12:27,399
That's very important.

812
01:12:27,399 --> 01:12:30,359
You see, there are always more relevant passages.

813
01:12:30,359 --> 01:12:38,359
So he reads the Homeric Greek story, the Homer story, in a way the way I do.

814
01:12:38,319 --> 01:12:52,799
The cheat can, in spite of having done this, those stupid Greeks, in a way, will take her back as a victor queen in triumph because they won the war, presumably, among other things, and she'll live happily ever after.

815
01:12:53,120 --> 01:13:01,279
And he thinks he'd better kill her because that would be disgusting from there, from his point of view.

816
01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:02,960
Now, that's good.

817
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:04,799
I've got to write that down.

818
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:08,479
Okay, I think, yeah, I can stop now and write it down.

819
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:14,160
And next time, be sure and read book four, because that's what Beatrice is going to talk about the whole time.

820
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:14,799
Next time.
