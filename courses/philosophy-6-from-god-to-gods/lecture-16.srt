1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,639
All I want to talk about is what it is to be a work of art and say that this is our best and in fact only example of a reconfiguring work of art that we've got, and that you can see enough in it to get a sense of what it is like to be a reconfigurer, changing the culture radically, but not quite knowing what you're doing.

2
00:00:26,639 --> 00:00:30,800
And I'm going to go back to talking about that right away.

3
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:41,279
So the slogan for what it is to be a reconfigurer is that he was in the world and the world came into being through him.

4
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:48,879
As John says on the first page and all over the place over and over.

5
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,719
But I'm talking about what is, I've been told I should do book and verse instead of page numbers.

6
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,640
So I'm in, how do I do that?

7
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,520
11810.

8
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,719
If you look in the top corners, you get the book and the verse, I guess.

9
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:07,839
And then if you look at the little numbers, you get the line.

10
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:15,199
So if you say 1, 18, 10, you find he was in the world that had come into being through him.

11
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:23,360
And that very peculiar relationship to be able to create the world from within it is what we want to talk about.

12
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,840
And I had one new thought about it.

13
00:01:25,839 --> 00:01:28,160
I think I think about it all the time.

14
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,559
And every once in a while something strikes me, and sometimes it turns out to be illuminating, and sometimes not.

15
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,879
It's very hard to describe.

16
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:36,759
I knew that.

17
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:44,760
What the artwork, when it works, or in this case, what Jesus does when he does his reconfiguring.

18
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,760
He's not discovering what was already there.

19
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,679
That would be articulating and renewing.

20
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:54,999
And he's not creating it.

21
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:03,159
It's something more like creating it, but creating it suggests that sort of creation ex nihilo, as they say.

22
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:06,599
That is, it's certainly not creation out of nothing.

23
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,520
There's something already there.

24
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,719
Otherwise, as I keep saying, the reconfigure would just be raving madness.

25
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:16,440
And Jesus comes close to being raving madness.

26
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:24,600
And a lot of the priests, high priests, think it is raving madness, but it isn't.

27
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,559
So what is it between discovering and creating?

28
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,080
Well, there's a word for it.

29
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,439
It's revealing.

30
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,959
It's a revelation.

31
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:34,520
We don't have to make up a word for it.

32
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,520
That's what people said it was.

33
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,200
That what Jesus is bringing is bringing a revelation.

34
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,119
A revelation isn't just discovering something that's already there, and it isn't creating it out of nowhere.

35
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:48,360
I've been calling it articulation.

36
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:55,640
I now think the Bible name for reconfiguring is revelation.

37
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,279
And I try to remember to use it that way.

38
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:00,920
Maybe that'll be illuminating and maybe it won't.

39
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,559
But I'll give it a try.

40
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:10,920
Where we were last time at the end was talking about the Holy Spirit.

41
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:13,999
I think I got the Holy Spirit wrong.

42
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:15,760
So I'm going to try again.

43
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:29,919
I was in a big hurry at the end, and I said the Holy Spirit is like the way the artwork shines, and it's the fact that in the light of the artwork, the Christian will always know what to do in each particular situation.

44
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,559
And I think that's all true.

45
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:47,440
The artwork shines, and for reasons I'll explain later, before the end of the lecture today, why the Christian knows what to do in every particular situation and doesn't need the law to tell the Christian.

46
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,640
But that's not what the paraclete, the Holy Spirit, is doing.

47
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,239
That the Holy Spirit is a counselor.

48
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,560
It gets translated that sometimes.

49
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:05,359
It's not something that happens to the Christian sort of inside.

50
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,919
It's something that happens in the public domain.

51
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:16,640
The Holy Spirit or the counselor comes after Jesus is gone.

52
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:25,760
And Jesus says, and we'll go look at that: the paraclete, that is the Holy Spirit, will teach you everything and remind you of all I have said.

53
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:31,279
Look at, I have to say 1264 to myself, and you can hear it too.

54
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:40,719
And then when I get there, to those who have a sense of what I should be saying, I'll give you the lines verse and so forth.

55
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:45,520
So in 164, we're in 1420.

56
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:50,719
And 1420 from there, we're in line 25.

57
00:04:51,520 --> 00:05:03,640
Jesus says, I have said these things to you while still with you, but the paraclete, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything and remind you of all I have said to you.

58
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:13,080
Well, boy, is that different than saying, you know, that they will ask, every Christian will see everything in the light of this and act sort of spontaneously.

59
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,720
That's true, all right, but that's not the job the paraclete's doing.

60
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:22,679
It's going to teach, look at you everything and remind you of all I have said to you.

61
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,520
And remember that things weren't understandable before.

62
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,640
The world did not understand him or it while Jesus was around.

63
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:37,000
Well, after I said all that, what do you think the Paraclete is?

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:48,919
I mean, if you're trying to map this on the kind of ontology in which you've got reconfigurers, well, I'm convinced now until I get talked out of it, the Paraclete is the articulator.

65
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:52,279
Remember that I said, I mean, I was right in staring me in the face.

66
00:05:52,279 --> 00:06:09,879
I said last time, every reconfigurer needs an articulator, because the reconfigurer is so confused because everything is so new, and there's no language to say what he's trying to say, or to trying to put in the work of art of whatever sort.

67
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,560
Every reconfiguring work, and I only know this one.

68
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:17,799
Well, no, I know I said Descartes was another hill, and there are probably more if you think about it.

69
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:22,600
But anyway, a reconfigurer needs at least one articulator.

70
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:26,680
Descartes had Kant, but then he had people after Kant too.

71
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,800
And Jesus has a whole bunch of articulators coming after him.

72
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:35,159
And I think they're all the Holy Spirit.

73
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:48,320
So the disciples are so dense, not out of stupidity, but just out of the fact that they can't, it's all so new, and there's no framework for Jesus to explain his teachings and practices.

74
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:54,239
So he better send somebody who can make sense of it all later on when he's gone.

75
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:06,239
As long as he's around, they can just sort of imitate him and be sort of overwhelmed by his glorification and his miracles, which I had forgotten play such a big role in the Gospel of John.

76
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,719
They don't play any role in what I'm talking about.

77
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:13,200
Well, I guess a weakness, but again, it's not what I'm trying to talk about.

78
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:24,479
So Jesus had better send somebody, and he does, and that's, and sends a whole series of people to explain what it's all about.

79
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,200
So there's more about this on 160.

80
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:36,080
That's 16, 13, 16, and then 13, and then line 13.

81
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:47,919
However, when the Spirit of truth comes, that's the Holy Spirit again, he will lead you to the complete truth, since he will not be speaking of his own accord, but will say only what he has been told.

82
00:07:47,919 --> 00:08:02,000
That is, the articulator will do not what his own ideas are, but he'll articulate what the reconfigurer was, so to speak, groping for and trying to say, only it was so new he couldn't say it.

83
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,440
That seems, yeah.

84
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,320
Uh-oh.

85
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,920
Which part?

86
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,720
Now, I hear lots of strange noises, but I can't tell what I'm doing.

87
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:14,240
If I fixed it, I can't tell by feeling.

88
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,840
Okay, now, is that okay?

89
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:18,480
And now I'm not going in and out, and it's better.

90
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,520
Okay, good.

91
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,480
Thanks.

92
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:30,600
Whenever you or anybody finds that it's not going well, let me know because we've got these podcast people literally all over the world who are listening.

93
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:41,800
I just got an email this morning from a truck driver who listens as he drives his big rig across the country and says when he comes to a truck stop and gets time, he's going to send me a paper on the Brothers Karamatsov.

94
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,480
He's listening to Pelosi 7.

95
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,920
So we have to be helpful to these people.

96
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,679
Okay, so here we are.

97
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:57,720
Now, so the Spirit will lead them to say what the Reconfigure has been trying to say.

98
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:06,600
And who are these articulators, these counselors, these Holy Spirits that are being sent?

99
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,279
Well, I think they are St.

100
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:18,440
Paul, who is the first to write his systematic account of what's the most important thing in all this, which for him is love.

101
00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:23,880
It's amazing how little the role of love plays in the Gospel of John.

102
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,039
It gets mentioned, I think, just twice, but it's the most important thing.

103
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:33,800
And Jesus already says it's the most important thing, but Paul makes a big fuss about this being the most important thing.

104
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,560
Then there's the Gospel of John.

105
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:38,360
I think that's also sent.

106
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,360
And then people you've vaguely heard about me mentioning maybe St.

107
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:56,680
Augustine in 300 AD, roughly, has his way of articulating the whole thing by mapping the whole story onto Plato, which turns out not to be very successful for reasons I haven't got time to go into.

108
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,719
And then St.

109
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:04,440
Thomas Aquinas does his articulating, and that's what Dante draws on.

110
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,000
So next week, I'll say a little bit more about Aristotle and St.

111
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,120
Thomas.

112
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:17,919
And then Luther comes along as another kind of articulator and another example of Pericleta, I think.

113
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,479
And he, well, Dante makes total sense of this and St.

114
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,200
Thomas.

115
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:26,080
But they make sense of it one way, as you'll see.

116
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,600
And then Luther comes along and just flips it around.

117
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:36,800
He's almost a reconfigurer, but not really, because Jesus and the Savior and all that is still central for him.

118
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,640
But Luther makes a big switch on it and renews it.

119
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,319
All that's under the category, under the, I think, of what the Holy Spirit does.

120
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,040
And what's interesting is there could be only one reconfigurer.

121
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:56,560
That's why Jesus is the incarnation.

122
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:58,640
He's not an incarnation.

123
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:07,360
I mean, you can't re, if there were another one, it would be of a different world because every reconfigurer produces a world.

124
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,920
But there can be lots of articulators.

125
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,760
And I don't think one should think of them as little incarnations.

126
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:21,360
Incarnation is a job for reconfigurers to embody a new truth.

127
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,960
But there is this one incarnation, and then there are all these articulators, and we need a name for them.

128
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,199
So we'll call them the Paraclete.

129
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,679
And that's what I think I should have said.

130
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,800
Now, now comes what I want to talk about today, having fixed, I hope, what I did last time.

131
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,920
And that is, well, how is this reconfiguring done?

132
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,159
We get to see it done right, so to speak, in front of us.

133
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,399
Uh-oh, but we don't get to see it quite as much as I hoped, because I think I left a page.

134
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,919
Come on, but that's all right.

135
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,560
I sort of know it.

136
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,080
No, I've got it.

137
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,760
But I'm not ready to read it yet.

138
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:14,200
So, how does it get, we're going to see in front of us in slow motion, so to speak, a world being transformed utterly, namely the Hebrew world being transformed into what will later be called the Christian world, and we need to see how it's going to happen.

139
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:29,319
And there are probably lots of ways of looking at this, but the way I want to look at it, because it's the way I can understand it, is that Jesus says he's the truth and the way, and you can hear this.

140
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:39,320
The truth is that he's got a whole new description of everything, cosmos and God and people and so forth.

141
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:45,640
Then, the way, I just decided this morning means it's a way of life.

142
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:52,360
It's also a path to God, in that sense, the way, but that's not what I want to think about today.

143
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:58,600
In Dante, there's a different sense in which Jesus is the way, the way to get there.

144
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:08,679
But I think the main thing is it's the way to live and to be the only way, according to Jesus, to live, to be a human being.

145
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:18,120
And that's what we have to figure out: what that way is, and how he's going to switch the Hebrew way of being to the Christian way of being.

146
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,760
And so, here we go.

147
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:32,440
The Hebrew way, as you hear sort of in the background conversation, because since they're all Hebrews, they can sort of take it for granted, is that you live according to the law.

148
00:13:32,439 --> 00:13:34,520
I mentioned that already.

149
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:48,160
There's the Ten Commandments, but there's also the whole book of the Old Testament devoted to the laws, down to the tiniest laws about what you can and can't do on the Sabbath and what you can and can't eat and so forth.

150
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:56,559
And the laws sort of totally circumscribe what you can and can't do, and you live by that, then you're righteous.

151
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:01,039
I talked about that just briefly, but now we have to talk about it much more.

152
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:17,120
And what Jesus is going to do is get rid, well, get rid isn't the right way to put it, is going to do something to the notion of righteousness so that it turns out to mean something very, very, very different than what it meant before.

153
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:24,159
And the way to live is going to turn out to mean something very, very different, something totally new on the planet, I think.

154
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:37,840
I don't think any other culture had it or any other culture ever got it except the way, except our culture, insofar as and as long as we are or were this kind of Christian culture.

155
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:44,159
And I did give a slogan for what will have to be done by a reconfigurer.

156
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,359
I don't know if any of you remember.

157
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,440
I'm not even sure whether I actually said it.

158
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:50,480
But the way you reconfigure, well, let me set it up.

159
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,720
How could you reconfigure a culture?

160
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,760
It looks like it's a kind of impossible thing.

161
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:01,920
Because if you totally change it, you're crazy, and nobody understands a thing you're saying.

162
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:07,760
And if you use the language that's already there, you're just an articulator of the old.

163
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,279
You're not a beginner of the radically new.

164
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:23,280
But is there something in between repeating and sharpening up and articulating on the one hand and being raving mad on the other?

165
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,000
Original to the point of craziness.

166
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,679
Yes, there is, and it's very interesting.

167
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:35,399
Jesus shows us how to do it.

168
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:47,640
And that is, take something crucial in the practices that you're in at that point and make it marginal.

169
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:53,800
And take something that's marginal in the practices, barely noticed, and make it central.

170
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,319
That gives you all you want.

171
00:15:55,799 --> 00:16:00,600
It sort of destroys the old understanding or totally relativizes it.

172
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:07,080
And it makes you intelligible because you've got something from the old practices.

173
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:08,680
And Jesus does it.

174
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:21,080
And he does it in something that you don't have a copy of because I didn't think of adding it to the Gospel of John handout.

175
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:27,960
So I will have to tell you, it's the Gospel of Matthew 5.

176
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,399
And I'm going to read you from it.

177
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,760
The crucial sentence.

178
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,279
I mean, this is all my story.

179
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:38,839
I don't know whether I didn't find this in any books.

180
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:42,839
For all I know, everybody says this or nobody says this, but here's how it looks to me.

181
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:44,920
There's one way to see the flipover.

182
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:47,079
As I say, not the only way.

183
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:50,359
Is a sentence in the Sermon on the Mount.

184
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:52,760
Jesus is giving this speech.

185
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,440
Is it in anything besides Matthew?

186
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,319
I don't think so.

187
00:16:55,319 --> 00:16:55,719
It's in.

188
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,639
I see.

189
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:59,559
Is this sentence in it always?

190
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,439
He says, you have learned, you were told, do not commit adultery.

191
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,319
But what I tell you is this.

192
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:15,439
If a man looks on a woman with a lustful eye, he's already committed adultery with her in his heart.

193
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:19,839
I don't know if that's in all of them, but that's going to flip around.

194
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:28,079
When you see all the implications of saying that, you will see that if you believe that, you're no longer in the Hebrew culture.

195
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,119
You're in some completely different world.

196
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:34,879
But I have to spell that out to explain why that's so.

197
00:17:34,879 --> 00:17:37,760
Now, why is that so weird?

198
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:44,079
Well, if you are obeying the law, then what you do is a public sort of thing.

199
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:46,079
You don't kill people.

200
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:47,919
You tell the truth.

201
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,559
You honor the Sabbath.

202
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,160
It's a whole list of things.

203
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,599
You eat what's kosher or not, and you don't eat what's not kosher.

204
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:02,159
There's a whole list of things that you do, public things, and you don't commit adultery.

205
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,720
Or if you do, you're in big trouble.

206
00:18:04,879 --> 00:18:06,559
Then you do a public thing.

207
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,760
You sleep with somebody's wife or husband.

208
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:19,119
And so what's interesting is if you obey the law, then it's all a question of options, public actions.

209
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,359
And it's under your control.

210
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:24,000
I mean, you can commit adultery or not commit adultery.

211
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,919
It's strictly up to you.

212
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,959
Or murder somebody or not murder somebody.

213
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:35,039
There's a whole list of things that you're supposed to do and you're able to do and able not to do.

214
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,520
And that's how you, and if you do what you're supposed to do, you lead a righteous life.

215
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,000
And if you don't, you lead a life.

216
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,760
I don't know what's probably not called sinner.

217
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,959
What's the opposite of righteous?

218
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,079
Do you know?

219
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,040
Wicked?

220
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,079
But I don't know what the term what I don't know what it is.

221
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,159
But anyway, you do the opposite.

222
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:52,959
You're unrighteous.

223
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,480
We can at least say that.

224
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:06,200
Okay, so, but the idea is that you should, it's all right to say don't commit adultery.

225
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,879
That's part of the law.

226
00:19:07,879 --> 00:19:12,279
But suppose you say, don't lust after a woman in your heart.

227
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,240
What weird commandment is that?

228
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,079
It's nothing public.

229
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:20,199
You can't sort of get three witnesses who say, yes, I saw him.

230
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,799
He was lusting after her in his heart and drag him into court.

231
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:30,439
There's nobody who can tell, and it doesn't make any difference anyway, because you don't do anything about it.

232
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:36,760
And suppose you try not to lust after a woman in your heart because you believe Jesus that that's a very bad thing to do.

233
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,680
Well, of course, that makes it only worse.

234
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,119
You will have more fantasies about what you might be doing with this woman.

235
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:47,959
You can't control your desires.

236
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:58,200
And Jesus is saying, and this is the crucial thing, what you should do is have pure desires.

237
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,920
And what you are told you can't do, you will be sinful.

238
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:10,039
Now we have a word for it, if you have the wrong desires, like lustful desires.

239
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:18,039
So what was, so, and you are defined by your desires.

240
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:27,479
You're either a pure person who has the right kind, the good desires, or you're an impure person who has bad desires.

241
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,960
And if you have pure good desires, you're a good person.

242
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,079
And if you have these bad, lustful desires, you're a bad person.

243
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:35,559
And lo and behold, you can't do anything about it.

244
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:41,959
You can't decide by your free will and your actions whether you're a good person or a bad person.

245
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,799
That is pretty serious.

246
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:57,119
That was driving Paul crazy that he was going to be sort of defined by his desires, and he had all these desires that he didn't want to have, but he couldn't help having them.

247
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:00,720
So, and what is and what is he doing?

248
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:17,359
Well, Jesus is taking the law culture where desire doesn't even have, doesn't seem to have even a marginal, and you can't control it because there's no public example of it, you can't see it happening, and so forth.

249
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:28,240
And he wants to make it central, take it from being marginal and private and make it definitive of what you're doing and who you are.

250
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:42,799
And then I got to this point and thought, I've been teaching it this way, I've been teaching it this way for years, when a student came and both gave me a tremendous problem and solved the problem all at once.

251
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:53,919
Here's the problem I was worrying about, but what about what marginal, if your desires are what you shouldn't have?

252
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:59,119
And that's a marginal practice to say that there are desires you shouldn't have.

253
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,760
Where is there any evidence of that in the Hebrews that they cared at all about desires?

254
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,760
I mean, it's all about law.

255
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,039
That was my problem.

256
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:12,559
Because I had this theory, it must, how is he going to be even intelligible?

257
00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:22,559
If you went into Bali, for instance, and said, you know, you committed, you become sinful if you lust after a woman in your heart, it's not likely to be intelligible at all.

258
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,599
How come it was intelligible to the Hebrews?

259
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:32,680
Well, then a student said to me, thinking he was shooting me down, that really helping me a lot, but the Hebrews do care about desires.

260
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,760
How many know the Ten Commandments?

261
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,879
Anybody?

262
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,079
Do you recognize what there's a commandment about desire tucked in there?

263
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:42,039
One.

264
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:44,520
Exactly.

265
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:49,079
You shall not covet your neighbor's property, his wife, and so forth.

266
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:53,160
That's coveting is a private desiring thing.

267
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:57,559
You can't sort of catch somebody coveting and then take them to court about it.

268
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:04,599
Moreover, if you can't help coveting your neighbor's BMW or whatever the latest version of this is.

269
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:05,319
Yeah, Barry.

270
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,359
Aha.

271
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,799
Interesting.

272
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:14,199
How does it fit with Descartes inventing the inner, Barry asks?

273
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,240
Because they had the inner already.

274
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,839
I guess it's another version of taking something marginal and making it central.

275
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:25,319
For the Hebrews, there was something inner.

276
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:28,919
For the Christians, what was inner was very important.

277
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,639
For Descartes, everything is inner.

278
00:23:31,639 --> 00:23:34,839
I mean, there's us and there's the external world.

279
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:40,679
And all of our experience is inner.

280
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,279
We can talk more about that.

281
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:45,879
But it gets more and more extreme.

282
00:23:45,879 --> 00:23:48,680
But it's inner enough already with coveting.

283
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:57,879
And it's interesting that it's not an accident, I'm sure, that the Hebrews get more inner in Jesus and it gets more inner in Augustine.

284
00:23:57,879 --> 00:24:00,760
What's puzzling is it doesn't get any more inner in St.

285
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,520
Thomas, but that's because Aristotle got into the act.

286
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,439
Well, we'll have to put, let's put that aside.

287
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:12,520
Okay, we'll talk about it when we don't have to presuppose things that I would have to explain.

288
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,919
So let me go back to, so here we are.

289
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,199
I got told, look at this commandment about coveting.

290
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:30,959
At the time, I thought, gee, that's the disaster for my view, because I just said the Hebrews don't understand how you could be responsible and guilty for your desires.

291
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:37,200
And here they are giving you one of the commandments for which you should be responsible and guilty for your desires.

292
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,039
So my first move was, as you might imagine, look at the translation.

293
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,840
Surely people have mistranslated the Hebrew for years.

294
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:45,680
Coveting can't be.

295
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,240
Those are sort of wishing you had what the neighbor has.

296
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,799
And I couldn't, I mean, I tried all the various Hebrew translations I knew of people to give me.

297
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,319
No, it really says coveting.

298
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:03,359
Coveting is really when you're looking on your neighbor's whatever and wishing you had it.

299
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:08,000
And so, but then I realized, no, but that's, I shouldn't be trying to get rid of it.

300
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,079
It's the answer to my problem.

301
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:21,039
It's the marginal practice that there is a dim sense that sometimes your desires can be bad and can be important.

302
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,799
They're not very important.

303
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,240
They don't define you.

304
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,039
We've got all kinds of other important jobs to do that are not desires.

305
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:36,720
Keep the Sabbath, keep the food right, don't kill people, and so forth and so forth.

306
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,719
Let me say one more thing, and then you can.

307
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:57,359
But what's interesting to me, and maybe you're about to give me a new problem, I love it, if it's true, that there's exactly 10% of the practices in the Ten Commandments anyway, are desire practices, and I suspect 90% are action and law practices.

308
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:03,000
As I said, you can actually see it happening that you're switching the marginal to the center.

309
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:18,679
Jesus is, and he's switching, and we haven't seen what he does to the law yet, but it's clear that if it's going to turn out to be important, how if your desires are going to turn out to be what's most important, the law is going to be put in some kind of new position.

310
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,440
But first, I want to hear what you have to say.

311
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,079
Yeah.

312
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,680
Because I'm not sure I heard you, but I think I did.

313
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,719
You mean because it's one of the Ten Commandments, it's already not marginal.

314
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,199
It's important.

315
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:29,160
Is that what you said?

316
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:30,199
Okay.

317
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,039
Yeah, I think that's right.

318
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:36,120
But it's only, I mean, how can I put it?

319
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:46,919
It's very important, but there are at least nine other equally important, or some of them much more important, I think, for the Sabbath and God honoring God and so forth.

320
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,599
It's 10% of what's important is all right with me.

321
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:51,960
That's pretty marginal.

322
00:26:51,960 --> 00:27:05,079
I mean, it doesn't, nobody gets, sort of spells out and worries a lot about coveting, as far as I know, where they've got other things to worry about, like the law about the Sabbath, because the law tells you what you can and can't do.

323
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:06,360
So I'm going to stick to this.

324
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:09,160
I mean, you can just make it sort of, you know, rough.

325
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:24,119
I mean, I can't, there's no such way as to say exactly what percent of the practices, coveting practices are, and what percent of the law prohibits desiring things.

326
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:28,599
And you can look for yourselves, reread the Ten Commandments, think about it.

327
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:47,760
How much of the Hebrew system holds you responsible for your desires and thinks of you as guilty or not, depending on your desires, and finally defines who you are in terms of whether you have pure or impure desires.

328
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,520
That's what makes the difference between being saved and not saved.

329
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,359
As we'll see in a minute.

330
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:55,039
Okay, now let's see.

331
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:02,240
So, what you have to do is purify your desires.

332
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,919
I'm now back, I'm not in the Hebrew anymore.

333
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,440
I'm back in the Christian for a minute.

334
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,839
From Jesus' point of view, you have to purify your desires.

335
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:13,839
But that's not up to you.

336
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,440
So, what does it mean?

337
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,879
You have to be saved.

338
00:28:16,879 --> 00:28:27,279
That is, somebody has to come in and rescue you, because there you are, full of bad desires, and everybody has them, and the more you resist them, the worse they get.

339
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,119
And only a Savior can save you.

340
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:33,359
And how would a Savior save you?

341
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:37,359
Well, you'd have to be in some way transformed.

342
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,959
And the words for it are reborn.

343
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:49,919
You have to be reborn as a non-sinful, non-bad desiring person.

344
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,119
And only Jesus can do that for you.

345
00:28:53,920 --> 00:29:01,919
If Jesus takes over your body and lives in you, then you no longer will have the sinful desires.

346
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,080
And that's a big change.

347
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:15,760
You see, the more you spell out this one little thing about don't, you commit adultery if you lust after it in your heart, and you see all the implications of it, a whole different role for Jesus comes in there.

348
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:33,159
I mean, no rabbi or priest had to come along and save you, transform you, give you the new body, and in order to make you able to be a good and joyful human being.

349
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,639
Anyone want to say anything about this?

350
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:39,480
Glimmers of doubt or agreement.

351
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:41,480
Okay, well, I'm going to go on.

352
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:50,520
So, and when you get transformed, you will have a new commandment.

353
00:29:50,839 --> 00:30:00,679
The new commandment, which is a very important one, 1263, and in fact, replaces all the other commandments, it turns out.

354
00:30:01,639 --> 00:30:03,400
Oh, where's my 1263?

355
00:30:03,639 --> 00:30:05,399
Ah, yeah, 1263.

356
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:10,439
Okay, that's 14, 19 in the right-hand corner.

357
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,599
It's line 34.

358
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:14,439
I give you a new commandment.

359
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,640
Love one another.

360
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:18,599
You must love one another just as I love you.

361
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:23,240
Now, that's a bigger deal than John makes it out to be.

362
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,319
Paul is the one who sees that that's a very, very big deal.

363
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:36,599
Because once you love one another, you aren't going to have these bad desires anymore.

364
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:39,559
You're going to help your neighbor.

365
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:49,879
But the question will still be: and how do you get to be able to have this kind of love, which I will explain more in a minute.

366
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,079
Well, you can't do it by willpower because you're full of all these bad desires.

367
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:59,079
So you have to be, we're back to that again, transformed and reborn.

368
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:03,000
But when you are transformed and reborn, then you've got love.

369
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And gape.

370
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:08,520
That gets translated charity.

371
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:15,359
But now charity has come to mean so much like giving to the poor that it's better to go back to calling it love.

372
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:23,440
And Paul says faith, hope, and love are the main thing, and of those three, love is the most important.

373
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,799
I think he says that, doesn't he?

374
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,119
So love turns out to be everything.

375
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:35,199
And agape is a kind of love, and it's a different kind of love than what you have when you have the bad desires.

376
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,559
That's eros.

377
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:45,359
Eros from Plato, we get erotic from that, is desire that comes from lack.

378
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:46,799
You need something.

379
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:55,439
And that's how you are when you're lusting after your neighbor's wife or husband and so forth.

380
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:05,279
And agape is the kind of love you have when you've already been transformed and completely fulfilled so that you don't need anything.

381
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:14,240
And you've got overflowing love for everybody that you can help in any way that gets sort of summed up in love your neighbor.

382
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:19,440
And now, how is this related to the law?

383
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:25,359
Well, in a way, there's so many things I want to say at once.

384
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:27,760
I think the way to do it is this.

385
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,639
I don't think my notes are in the best right order.

386
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,879
In the Sermon on the Mount, back to that.

387
00:32:34,879 --> 00:32:35,760
Here it is.

388
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,560
He begins, Jesus, by addressing the question of the law.

389
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,359
Because I guess I should try to keep this in clear order.

390
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,240
Now the question ought to be.

391
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,200
Let me try to keep it straight.

392
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,560
How is this going to be, what are we going to do with the law?

393
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:53,760
It's going to preserve it but marginalize it?

394
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,559
Because that's what you've got to do if you're going to flip around the margin to the center, which we just did.

395
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,440
Desire and a special kind of, not even desire.

396
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,000
It turns out desire is still bad.

397
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,400
Love turns out to be, a certain kind of feeling turns out to be central to everything.

398
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,079
It's the commandment.

399
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:15,639
But what happens to the other commandments?

400
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:17,399
What happens to the law?

401
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:20,039
You can't just throw it away.

402
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,680
You're not going to get the Hebrews to throw away the law.

403
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,319
So you've got to have a way to save the law.

404
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:28,520
Well, this is what Jesus starts the Sermon on the Mount with.

405
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,119
Do not suppose, it doesn't start.

406
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:33,559
It's Matthew 5:17.

407
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:37,240
Do not suppose that I have come to abolish the law.

408
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,800
But I did not come to abolish, but to complete.

409
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,720
I'm going to have to figure out what that means.

410
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:54,520
I tell you this, so long as heaven and earth endure, not a letter, not a stroke will disappear from the law until all that must happen, has happened, all that must happen has happened.

411
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,920
I don't know what that means.

412
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:02,440
Maybe it means that everybody has been transformed into loving people.

413
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:11,800
If any man sets aside even the least of the law's demands and teaches others to do the same, he will have the lowest place in the kingdom of heaven.

414
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:16,759
So it looks like, at first sight anyway, it's really complicated and interesting.

415
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,600
The law is doing fine.

416
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:21,239
Jesus hasn't put down the law.

417
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,159
You're supposed to obey it completely.

418
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:26,840
And it's the most important thing to do to obey it completely.

419
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:37,640
Yet, and this is when it gets sort of puzzling and interesting, Jesus himself breaks the law.

420
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:40,840
And that's when the rabbis get very upset at him.

421
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:47,920
He's not honoring the Sabbath on 1243.

422
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:49,759
Then I'll tell you what else that is.

423
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,359
1243?

424
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,039
That seems unlikely.

425
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:54,000
Yeah, yeah.

426
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,160
The very first, the very beginning.

427
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,720
Line 16, the first page.

428
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:03,760
Indeed, from his fullness, we have all of us received one gift replacing another.

429
00:35:03,759 --> 00:35:09,200
For the law was given through Moses, grace and truth have come through Jesus Christ.

430
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:17,520
So something has replaced the law, but not gotten rid of the law.

431
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,840
How can you understand that?

432
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:27,039
Well, for one thing, you don't really have to obey the law anymore in spite of what the Sermon on the Mount says.

433
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:31,919
And it's all sort of confusing because, as I keep saying, Jesus is very confused about it.

434
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:51,920
He hasn't got a clear idea of what it is that the law is supposed to do, but he knows something, namely, that you don't have to literally obey the law in order to somehow be in tune with the law, let's say, or, yeah, something like that.

435
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,119
So here's what happens.

436
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,680
We're now on page 1248.

437
00:35:55,679 --> 00:36:00,320
Just to say it quick outright, guys, some of you probably noticed, maybe.

438
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:06,160
Jesus goes around and does things on the Sabbath that the law says you're not supposed to do on the Sabbath.

439
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:15,120
So it can't be that when the Sermon on the Mount says you shouldn't, you have to do, not one letter, not a stroke of the law will disappear.

440
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:21,599
That can't be quite taken literally because he's breaking the law.

441
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,200
And here it is on 437, line 8.

442
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:33,559
Jesus said, after he heals this man who's been crippled for years, get up, pick up your sleeping mat, and walk around.

443
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:35,800
The man was cured and walked around.

444
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,119
Now that day happened to be the Sabbath.

445
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:41,559
So the Jews said to the man who had been cured, it is the Sabbath.

446
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:43,720
You're not allowed to carry your sleeping mat.

447
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:49,319
And he replied, that the man who cured me told me, pick up your sleeping mat and walk around.

448
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:59,079
And then looking at the next page, line 15, the man went back and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had cured him.

449
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:04,039
It was because he did things like this on the Sabbath that the Jews began to harass Jesus.

450
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:09,000
His answer to them was, My father still goes on working, and I'm at work too.

451
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:18,919
But that only made the Jews even more intent on killing him because he was breaking, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he spoke as if God was his father.

452
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,240
But we're sticking to breaking the Sabbath.

453
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:25,240
Now, how can you understand what's going on there?

454
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:45,160
And how does the law get marginalized into something much less important than it was, and even in a certain sense, clearly breakable, and yet completely, somehow preserved and even completed and fulfilled?

455
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:48,120
Well, Jesus doesn't explain it.

456
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,200
As I say, he doesn't understand it.

457
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:51,719
And John doesn't explain it.

458
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:53,320
Even he doesn't understand it.

459
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:55,960
I don't know whether Paul might.

460
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:59,480
I'm not an expert in reading Paul.

461
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,480
But Augustine understands it.

462
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,320
Augustine says, love and do what you will.

463
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:07,160
Now, what does that mean?

464
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:22,640
That means that if you're filled with agape love for all people, and whatever you do will be, so to speak, in that situation, the right thing to do, the good thing to do.

465
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:28,240
And it'll sometimes, as I said, I think last time, I don't remember why I already said it, it could be tough love.

466
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,960
in which you refuse them what they're asking for.

467
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:37,520
It could be tender love, in which you give them what they're asking for, or it could be the kind of love that helps them understand what they really need.

468
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:53,120
But in any given situation, if you don't have any selfish desires and any needy lusts, but you are just sensitive to what the situation requires, you will do the appropriate thing.

469
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:59,760
And on the Sabbath, if somebody needs to get cured and get up and carry their sleeping mat around, then they'll do that.

470
00:38:59,759 --> 00:39:03,119
And that, this is my version.

471
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:07,039
Now, maybe not the right or the official version, I don't know.

472
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:38,800
But that completes the law or fulfills the law because if the law was trying to get people to do what was the right thing to do by giving them all these rules, this fixes it because now you can do the right thing without having to have any rules, provided you have the right desires or the right, you see, if I put desire up here, I need something to call this.

473
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,839
I don't know what to call it, the right feelings or something.

474
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,839
What is love?

475
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,520
It's not a desire.

476
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,079
It's a, I don't know, affect maybe.

477
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,599
Fancy word.

478
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:50,799
Anyway, just one second.

479
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,800
Let me say, so, so, let me just try to finish this.

480
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:10,360
So the job the law was trying to do was to get, which was to get people to do what was a good thing to do, has now been completed better because these old rules were just too crude.

481
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:18,520
Just to say you can't ever help somebody out on the Sabbath if that helping out goes against the kind of things you could do or not do by the rules.

482
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,360
That's much too crude.

483
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:41,079
If you could get somebody into an emotional state in which they were always open and sensitive to the needs of whatever was going on, you would do what the law was trying to do, that is, enable people, lead people to do good things all the time, and then you would have completed the law.

484
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:45,240
But you would have, and then I'll let you talk in a second, would have relativized the law.

485
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:56,919
Because now the whole law turns out to be all turning around this commandment that you should love your neighbors and be filled with agape love.

486
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:01,320
And the details of the law aren't important anymore at all.

487
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:06,520
Because they, again, I say, it's the spirit of the law is now what's going to save.

488
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,880
That's a Jesus comment, isn't it?

489
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,839
The spirit saves.

490
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:09,799
Paul.

491
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:14,199
Paul says the spirit of the law saves, but not the letter of the law.

492
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:15,640
And that's just what I'm saying.

493
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:25,559
I mean, don't worry about the rules as long as you are a saved, reborn, pure, loving person.

494
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,800
Do whatever seems like you need to do.

495
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:33,799
Love, as Augustine says, love and do what you will.

496
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:41,960
That's my version of how you can marginalize the law without in any way thinking that you've abrogated it.

497
00:41:42,759 --> 00:41:43,880
Now, I saw a hand.

498
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,520
Where was it?

499
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:46,079
I don't want to keep you from talking.

500
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:46,879
Somebody over there.

501
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,119
Yes.

502
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,159
Yes, it certainly is.

503
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:54,159
In fact, I'm making it up from there.

504
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:58,000
Let's see if I can say anything that will help.

505
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,240
That's a deep, deep question.

506
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:17,840
I mean, here's, there is in Aristotle the idea that the phronomus in Greek, that people use the Greek word, but it gets translated the man of practical wisdom, does the appropriate thing at the appropriate time in the appropriate way.

507
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:26,480
That is, without any rules, this wise person who's had lots of experience just is sensitive to the needs of the situation.

508
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,760
And that's virtue in Aristotle.

509
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:32,879
Now, you pose me the really tough question, too.

510
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:48,160
I don't think the phronomus, the man of practical wisdom, and who has virtue, is at all like the Christian saved soul that is filled with agape love.

511
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:49,920
Now, why is that?

512
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:57,280
Well, my first hunch is, oh, you all, he'll follow, and then you, and then my, go ahead.

513
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,480
Yes, but I mean, but we need the phenomenology of it.

514
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:15,879
That is, what's the experience of agape love and the way it you live when you're when you have it that differs from the experience of the phronomus who has virtue and live in when he has you think let's let let Dave try.

515
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,360
Yeah.

516
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:23,639
I think that the discussion there's been that friendship ah that's that's true.

517
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:24,520
Let's put that in here.

518
00:43:24,759 --> 00:43:26,919
That doesn't solve my problem altogether.

519
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,240
But it's activity.

520
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:30,039
That's true.

521
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:46,360
For Aristotle, when you're doing this practical good thing, it's in the context of doing good things for your friends, doing good things for the polis, doing things that will make you flourish, doing good things for your own happiness.

522
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:58,280
The idea that you just do good things for no reason except that you've overflowing love and you don't do them just for your friends, and you certainly don't do them just to flourish, and you don't do them for your country.

523
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,960
You do them just out of love, period.

524
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,480
That's the difference.

525
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:13,079
And the other difference I was going to get at, which is related to that, the man of practical wisdom, the Aristotelian one, has willpower involved.

526
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:20,200
I mean, he can do it or not do it, do whatever he thinks is the appropriate thing.

527
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:28,200
And so he and he has, so his character is what, and his strengthening of his will is important.

528
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:36,360
Whereas the Christian soul is going to give up his will altogether and let Jesus' love flow through him or her.

529
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:46,600
And it's not the kind of thing that you can resist and say no to or sort of decide to do and then do.

530
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:56,039
There's a lot more rationality and control, I think, in the Aristotelian man of practical wisdom than there is in the Christian saint.

531
00:44:56,039 --> 00:45:00,760
I mean, this, the pure reborn person is a saint, obviously.

532
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:11,960
They are when they say things like Jesus lives in me, Jesus acts through me, they are a channel for this agape love.

533
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:16,079
And Aristotle couldn't have any view like that.

534
00:45:14,199 --> 00:45:20,479
But the idea, but this prepares you for Dante, so I'll say one more thing.

535
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:28,160
Dante is trying to understand Christianity using Aristotelian categories.

536
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:30,160
Or that isn't even quite right.

537
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:38,240
Dante is using Virgil to explain Christianity using Aristotelian categories.

538
00:45:38,239 --> 00:46:00,800
And the interesting question you have to have in mind as you read Dante, I'll show you how to do it next time, is Virgil getting it right, trying to explain the Christian world with Aristotle as his only person to go on, which reminds me of something even more important, to give you the assignment for next time.

539
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,199
So you've got the inferno now.

540
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:05,200
You want to read for next time.

541
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:09,039
It's on the syllabus, but I just want to repeat it.

542
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:12,720
So cantos, that's what they're divided up into now.

543
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:18,880
Cantos 1 to 11.

544
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:20,239
Yeah, Beatrice.

545
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:26,799
That's right.

546
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:34,639
But in this new way, you don't have to internalize all the rules because you have one rule that we face.

547
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,960
Yes, I think that's right.

548
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:46,240
But the thronomus starts with rules and ends up with this sort of sensitivity to the particular situation.

549
00:46:46,239 --> 00:47:03,319
Whereas the Christian, the reborn Christian, just both gets rid of the rules, that's the letter of the law, and keeps the spirit of it as understood by Jesus and Paul, namely loving whoever loving your neighbor.

550
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:07,160
Okay, anybody else?

551
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:10,920
I better go back to where I am, which is hard to know because I've jumped all over.

552
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,360
So give me a moment.

553
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,319
Well, I wrote here, of course, the disciples don't understand this.

554
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,000
Let's look and see what that means.

555
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,079
1245.

556
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:26,120
I mean, the more you think about it, the more you see how hard it would be for anybody to understand it.

557
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:32,600
And the disciples are not in any particular position to get it right.

558
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:42,039
And if you think of Jesus as somebody who is somehow knows that he's a reconceived, I mean, no, that's not the way to put it.

559
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:59,960
Jesus, who's got a whole new way of thinking about what human beings essentially are, namely defined by their desires, and what the law really is, namely, not rules, but something more basic, they're going to have trouble articulating this.

560
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:04,680
So let's see now where I am to check this out.

561
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,520
Okay, 1245.

562
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:09,880
Actually, wait a minute.

563
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:12,920
This is not what I'm expecting to see.

564
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:17,640
What I got here is just to show you something I already said, that I've got to go back and look at it.

565
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:29,960
That is, down on 3, 6, line 3, they're talking to Jesus, and this is about being reborn.

566
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,079
Well, now let's go down to line 5.

567
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:38,439
In all truth, I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born through water and the Spirit.

568
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,359
What is born of human nature is human.

569
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,120
What is born of the Spirit is Spirit.

570
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:45,360
All that is just to say you've got to be totally transformed.

571
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:50,480
You can't just be born once, and then you're just a human being with all your lusts and desires.

572
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:59,520
You have to be reborn to be able to be pure in the way that Jesus is claiming you have to be pure.

573
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:06,239
And I don't know why I say that they couldn't understand this.

574
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:08,079
Now, I don't want to go into that.

575
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:16,400
So, did I read you already 148, 149, where he's setting aside the law and how he's talking about that?

576
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:18,640
Okay, well, we've got to look at this.

577
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,400
Okay, there's where he picked up.

578
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,520
Oh, yeah, I've done that.

579
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,240
Good.

580
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:22,960
And I've done it.

581
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,840
We did that.

582
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,759
That's where you are even better.

583
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,120
Okay, I'm ready to sum up, which I will do.

584
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:31,520
I'm not keeping anybody from saying anything.

585
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,120
Then let's go look at this.

586
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:50,320
So, what does this new cultural paradigm, this reconfigurer, Jesus, plus the articulator, John, change from the world of Virgil, the Roman world?

587
00:49:50,639 --> 00:50:03,599
Well, one thing is that instead of being stuck with sluggish bodies, the body is now absolutely central and important.

588
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:11,280
It's not the lustful body, but the reborn body, but it's still the body.

589
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,999
After all, God became a body.

590
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:21,920
If there was something wrong with bodies, if they were just sluggish and stupid and got in the way, why in the world would God become a body?

591
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:30,119
Having a body is absolutely essential to being a human being on this line, in a way that it isn't at all in Virgil.

592
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:37,240
And you get this coming out on 1245, 3, 6, and then 19.

593
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:42,599
Jesus says, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will rebuild it.

594
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:46,920
The Jews replied, It's taken 46 years to build the temple.

595
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,240
Are you going to raise it up again in three days?

596
00:50:49,239 --> 00:50:51,880
But he was speaking of the temple, it was his body.

597
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:56,039
And when Jesus rose from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this.

598
00:50:56,039 --> 00:50:58,839
I just, that's a hint that the body is a temple.

599
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,480
The body is a very, very good thing.

600
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:09,880
You'll see in Dante, too, that the people who die can't get along at all without bodies.

601
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:14,360
And Dante has a problem about that, which he solves.

602
00:51:14,679 --> 00:51:17,880
So the first thing is the body has become important.

603
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,199
The word has been made flesh from that.

604
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:26,680
And it turns out that what happens in the world is important.

605
00:51:26,679 --> 00:51:28,440
You can't get out of the world.

606
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:42,920
Remember, because Jesus is now incarnated God and shows God and is God, then there is an individual being in the world, in time, who is crucially important.

607
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,440
God isn't some other some, God the Father is something.

608
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:52,360
You don't ever get to see God the Father on this new version of Jesus' version.

609
00:51:52,360 --> 00:52:06,120
You get to see Jesus, who is an embodied, particular human being in the world, and yet crucially important, able to be worshipped, and is in effect a God.

610
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:16,719
He's a God, if you think of him in the way that he did in the people writing and the Gospel of John did, somehow God with a capital G.

611
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:23,760
I mean, I don't, I'm not a Christian believer, so I'm not sure I understand what that is, but that's all right.

612
00:52:23,759 --> 00:52:47,280
He's also a God in the sense that he's a reconfigurer, he reveals a new world, he changes what it is to be a human being, that is, changes, makes it possible for people to be reborn, and all of that is something amazing that an individual human being could do that.

613
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:52,480
And when a human being can do that, they're no longer just a human being.

614
00:52:53,599 --> 00:53:01,440
They're treated as sacred, they're adored, worshipped, they have all the properties of a God.

615
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,240
And that's happening.

616
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:19,280
And the present is important because unlike in the Aeneid, when it's either for Aeneids the past, the glory of Troy, or the future glory of Rome that matters, but the present doesn't matter.

617
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,720
This is what in the Bible is called the fullness of time.

618
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:27,200
When Jesus is there, that is the most important present.

619
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:35,200
Everything led up to that and everything that's going to happen from now on in the world is going to be determined by that.

620
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:57,199
That's why we recount the years from zero when Jesus, everything up to zero leads up to the God becoming man, and everything after zero, us, after AD, after God, that's what that AD means.

621
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:08,999
I'm saying, Doningo, everything after word gets its meaning all from this moment, this special moment when Jesus declared what?

622
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,800
Well, now we have a word for it, the revelation.

623
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:15,480
He reconfigured everything.

624
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,960
Okay, so the present is very important.

625
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:27,320
The law has been replaced by adapto, that is the law, the duty of the Romans to obey the law and do their civic duty.

626
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:32,039
All that's been replaced by love and do what you will.

627
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:37,639
And, well, I keep saying it, and that's the sense.

628
00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:40,840
Now, I just sort of step back and say what I've said.

629
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:45,960
There you get to see what reconfiguration looks like, sort of step by step.

630
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:55,320
I'm sure you could tell the same story about without having to start with lusting after a woman in your heart and adultery.

631
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:58,279
But you'd come to the same place no matter where you started.

632
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:14,600
You would be able to tell a story about how marginal practices got to be central for the Christians, and how the practices that were central for the Hebrews became marginal, and therefore you got a whole new world.

633
00:55:14,599 --> 00:55:16,679
Okay, that's how much I want to say about that.

634
00:55:16,679 --> 00:55:26,600
Now, either you all can say something, or I'm going to go on and talk about a kind of transition to Dante so that you have it in mind when you start trying to read it.

635
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,400
But first, I want to make sure we've finished.

636
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:41,160
I finish what I have to say about this, but I want to make sure that you finished, that you're either helpful or objecting or confused and want me to unconfuse you, or you want to confuse me.

637
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:43,400
Yeah, Beatrice.

638
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,319
Yes, Jesus.

639
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:44,879
Good.

640
00:55:44,119 --> 00:55:47,839
Jesus is, as described by John, of course.

641
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:50,559
We have to take John's word for it in this course.

642
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:56,480
So Jesus, as described by John, is a work of art working.

643
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:12,000
He is in his activity and in what he's saying and what he's showing, revealing a whole new understanding of being, and that's that makes him a work of art working.

644
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:15,119
What is God the Father?

645
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:15,520
Goodly.

646
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,039
Yeah, let's go through the Trinity again.

647
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:22,079
By the way, I found one place where John comes close to mentioning the Trinity.

648
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:37,840
For Christians, it should come as a surprise that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, which are the three aspects of God, hardly ever get mentioned in here, as far as I know, once.

649
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,559
And in the other Gospels, I think not at all.

650
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,799
There's God the Father sometimes.

651
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,280
There's God the Son sometime, that's Jesus.

652
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,120
There's the Holy Spirit sometime.

653
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:59,120
But the idea that they're all three, and all of them are God, you hear at various points, but that there is one God who has these three aspects put together in one sentence, so to speak.

654
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:04,160
I only found it on 1250 27.

655
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:07,440
Oh, wrong.

656
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,759
I'm sorry, that's not what I'm saying.

657
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,039
I may not find it.

658
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:12,559
I wasn't going to mention it.

659
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,559
But I think it's important to mention.

660
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:17,599
Although it's not a very exciting sentence when you get right down to it.

661
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:21,280
It's just that all three characters in it are mentioned.

662
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,640
If I don't find it, no, I didn't find it.

663
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:25,999
But anyway, I'll tell you.

664
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:42,360
What I'm taking to be God the Father, who would remember is invisible and is the creator of everything in that it it's thanks to God that anything sh shows up as anything.

665
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:46,439
People and things all get their shape and so forth.

666
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,240
And that's the background practices.

667
00:57:49,239 --> 00:57:54,280
That's the basic general language and practices of the people.

668
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,760
That's got to be there already.

669
00:57:56,759 --> 00:58:09,879
And then the articulator, Jesus, will take what is invisible background and embody it and glamorize it and make it shine.

670
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,999
By the way, glamorize, I realize too, there's a word for that.

671
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:20,759
All these words that you sort of I make up in trying to talk about it, I discovered the people who talked about it already had words.

672
00:58:21,159 --> 00:58:24,359
Jesus, as a work of art, isn't glamorized.

673
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,319
He's glorified.

674
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,920
That's the word for it.

675
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:40,679
And he is, in his shining and in his glory, manifest the invisible background practices so that you never have to get in touch with them anymore.

676
00:58:40,679 --> 00:58:42,600
I mean, they pervade everything.

677
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:46,200
They're the background of all intelligibility and meaning.

678
00:58:46,199 --> 00:58:49,720
They're why anything is able to show up as anything.

679
00:58:49,719 --> 00:58:57,239
But Jesus has now made it much more clear what the implications of all that is.

680
00:58:57,559 --> 00:59:22,880
And also, not only he's revealed it, but that doesn't mean it was there all along and he just discovered it by telling people how the law is fulfilled, for instance, and showing them a God they love and telling them that it's the most important commandment and showing them how he can give it to them and so forth.

681
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:36,400
He's taken up and transformed the background practices so that he's reconfigured them.

682
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,000
And how does this relate now to God?

683
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,240
What happens to God the Father?

684
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:47,039
Well, God the Father gets revealed in Jesus.

685
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:59,200
And now I'm trying to think, how do we ought to have a way of describing how God the Father gets transformed when the reconfigurer does what the reconfigurer does?

686
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:02,320
And how you don't get that in John.

687
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:06,320
Maybe that's another problem to think about for me.

688
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:09,920
Let me tell you clearly what I think the problem is.

689
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:19,600
I mean, if God is the understanding in the background practices, and you could have an articulator who just articulated that.

690
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:32,559
But if you've got a reconfigurer who changes the practices so that the law gets put into the love gets put as a new commandment and all that, that looks like that changes God.

691
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,720
And that's odd.

692
01:00:34,719 --> 01:00:39,600
I don't mind, except that John doesn't talk that way.

693
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:44,400
Jesus keeps saying, I just do what the Father tells me to do.

694
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:49,679
All I do is already, I mean, I never do anything in my own, on my own.

695
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:51,520
I only speak for the Father.

696
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:57,360
That is, I only manifest what's already in the background practices.

697
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:01,000
Then, how can He reconfigure God?

698
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,520
Hmm.

699
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,280
I don't know.

700
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,880
That's really deep.

701
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:06,679
Yeah.

702
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,079
Well, I don't think so.

703
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:19,799
I don't think that John or Jesus claim that the God of the Old Testament was already into agape and nobody noticed.

704
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:26,600
I mean, the God of the Old Testament was into giving Moses the law and the keeping the law, and that was what was in the background.

705
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:32,120
And that was still in the God that was in the background when Jesus showed up.

706
01:01:32,119 --> 01:01:38,679
Now, you could say, well, that God already really wanted people to have agape loved and being reborn and so forth.

707
01:01:38,679 --> 01:01:41,000
But why wouldn't you want to say that?

708
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
I mean, it looks like that's something that...

709
01:01:43,239 --> 01:01:46,359
But Jesus is sort of saying, I see what Beatrice is saying.

710
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,039
That is the easy way out.

711
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:51,000
Maybe you have to take the easy way out, but I'm going to try a harder one.

712
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,200
But the easy way out is to say, well, that's what God was trying to say all along.

713
01:01:56,199 --> 01:01:58,680
Jesus keeps saying, I'm not saying anything new.

714
01:01:58,679 --> 01:02:01,480
Everything I'm saying has been dictated by the Father.

715
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,879
You could read that as exactly what Beatrice says.

716
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:09,079
The real meaning of the background practices ever since Abraham has been this.

717
01:02:09,079 --> 01:02:11,480
But they haven't, they didn't know it.

718
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:14,600
And once you know it, it changes everything.

719
01:02:14,599 --> 01:02:16,119
I find that rather strange.

720
01:02:16,119 --> 01:02:18,039
I mean, I think, I don't know what to think.

721
01:02:18,039 --> 01:02:18,600
Yeah.

722
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:19,559
That's right.

723
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:25,799
And it's such a big change that now, if you ask Beatrice this question, and now if you ask, well, who is God the Father?

724
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,919
What is God the Father?

725
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,679
It would be better my way of thinking.

726
01:02:30,759 --> 01:02:36,599
Well, no, he's not because Jesus says that, you know, he's more powerful than me.

727
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:38,279
Everything I say, I get from him.

728
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:46,159
And so I'm happy to say God the Father is the background practices, the background understanding of being, but then, of course, I get into the trouble.

729
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:51,679
Then, has it been already all what the reconfigurer has just discovered?

730
01:02:51,679 --> 01:02:53,200
That doesn't feel right.

731
01:02:53,520 --> 01:03:00,160
When Jesus reveals it, the background practices, if he's really a reconfigurer, he changes them.

732
01:03:00,159 --> 01:03:07,680
And if he changes them, and God the Father really is the background practices, then God changes.

733
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:10,559
Yes, a new background is given.

734
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,240
Yes, that's right.

735
01:03:12,239 --> 01:03:13,919
A new background is given.

736
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:18,559
But then you ought to say that God has been changed.

737
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:24,079
Since God is the background, God has changed.

738
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:28,559
And I don't mind saying God has changed, but boy, that doesn't seem to be what John wants to say.

739
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:32,320
Maybe that's just because it's so radical, John doesn't know how to say it.

740
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:40,160
I mean, but I didn't realize I was committed to this, but I begin to think I am committed to this, and that's what Beatrice has forced me to see.

741
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,039
It's just that the understanding of God has changed.

742
01:03:44,239 --> 01:03:48,480
Okay, the understanding of being in the background practices has changed.

743
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,600
That maybe that's okay.

744
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:58,559
At any given stage, yeah, I think you're getting on the right track.

745
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:03,920
I think that we should, I mean, we're now getting really revisionary, I think.

746
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,279
You have to save the notion of God for Jesus.

747
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,479
I think who was saying that?

748
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:11,200
Maybe Barry was saying it.

749
01:04:11,199 --> 01:04:20,160
I think Jesus is God because he's the one who now, no, I don't want that either.

750
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:23,440
The background practices are God, and they've changed.

751
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:26,319
Jesus is God because he changed them.

752
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,440
But I don't get it yet.

753
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,559
Beatrice, you started this.

754
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:30,039
This is very interesting.

755
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:35,239
The whole conversation of God Abraham, the whole thing before.

756
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,079
Oh, yeah, that's right.

757
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,760
This is Abraham.

758
01:04:45,079 --> 01:04:49,639
Jesus replies, in all truth, I found him before Abraham never was by them.

759
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,679
Yes, that's very important and very relevant.

760
01:04:52,679 --> 01:04:53,799
I don't know what to make of it, though.

761
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,360
We're telling everybody where that is.

762
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:57,559
What?

763
01:04:58,599 --> 01:05:00,120
1256.

764
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:02,359
I mean, Jesus is claiming.

765
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:05,079
We're getting into really difficult stuff here.

766
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:13,640
Remember, I don't think this is going to help, but I put it on the table as part of what one would have to get straight if they ever got this straight.

767
01:05:13,639 --> 01:05:19,559
Jesus is claiming, according to John, that he's eternal, that Jesus is.

768
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:23,959
He's the word made flesh, and the word was with God all along.

769
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:30,840
And Jesus was there before Abraham, Jesus claims, according to the Gospel of John.

770
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:32,839
I think that's all Johnish talk, is it?

771
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,520
Is it in the other three Gospels?

772
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:35,079
No.

773
01:05:35,079 --> 01:05:41,239
See, this is, John is putting a very platonic Greek spin on it.

774
01:05:41,239 --> 01:05:53,160
If whatever is the ultimate meaning of reality must have been there all along, and if Jesus is the ultimate meaning of reality, then he must be identical with the intelligible structure of everything that must have been there all along.

775
01:05:53,159 --> 01:05:57,000
I mean, I think we should just ignore John when he talks like that.

776
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:03,879
He's doing the best he can with the vocabulary he's got, which is Greek vocabulary.

777
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:10,600
But it's not likely that the Greek vocabulary is going to capture this complicated Hebrew situation.

778
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:15,599
So we're free to try to capture it ourselves, but I'm not going to be able to do it, at least not right now.

779
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:15,999
Yeah.

780
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,640
Wow, another whole issue.

781
01:06:18,639 --> 01:06:22,960
Okay, yes, that's a complicated question.

782
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,720
Let's put that on the table, too.

783
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:27,440
Then we'll see how many things we don't understand.

784
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:41,920
I mean, one of the things the Hebrews and therefore the disciples didn't understand is whether Jesus was bringing a new commandment for the Hebrews or for everybody.

785
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:45,920
And the disciples among themselves argued about it.

786
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:53,200
And you probably know better than I, what James said it was for everybody, and Paul said it was just for the Jews, or something like that.

787
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:55,759
They were the other way around.

788
01:06:55,759 --> 01:06:56,159
Good.

789
01:06:56,159 --> 01:06:57,839
Okay, Paul said it was for everybody.

790
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:58,239
That's right.

791
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:00,079
James said it was just for the Jews.

792
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:02,239
Now, I guess that Paul made this great line.

793
01:07:02,239 --> 01:07:05,840
James said, well, look, you've got to be circumcised to be a Jew.

794
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:08,640
And therefore, this can only be for circumcised people.

795
01:07:08,639 --> 01:07:14,559
And therefore, it's obviously for the Hebrews, not for those other tribes and idol worshipers and stuff.

796
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:18,480
And Paul said, Jesus really means circumcision of the heart.

797
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,240
This peculiar, weasel-way of dealing with this.

798
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:26,640
But once you say that, you clear the way for it being universal.

799
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:30,720
But I don't really think that it's intrinsic to Jesus's message.

800
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:33,440
I think that's sort of Greek influence.

801
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:34,399
I trust Paul.

802
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:39,120
He was the closest to this feeling for these things.

803
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:45,599
I think Jesus was a new variation in the Hebrew understanding of being.

804
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:53,039
I don't see why this should be relevant to the people in Japan with their thousands of gods or the people in Bali at all.

805
01:07:53,040 --> 01:08:02,839
And it gets that way because James wins out, and Judaism, and the Hebrew thing claims to be universal.

806
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:04,679
It certainly doesn't start out universal.

807
01:08:04,919 --> 01:08:07,639
It starts out with God making a covenant with Israel.

808
01:08:07,639 --> 01:08:18,119
And I think it's that God that Jesus thinks that he's, we don't know why, changing, I'm afraid I have to say, reconfiguring.

809
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:18,520
Yeah.

810
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:26,119
Well, I mean, if he did, it certainly is a new covenant than the one he made with Abraham.

811
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:26,679
What?

812
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:28,119
Before.

813
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:39,240
Oh, yeah, well, then that's pretty peculiar because how come then Abraham thinks that he's got a covenant just for the Hebrews?

814
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:40,759
Well, I used to hear about this.

815
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:53,559
So there's this big debate, which now he's opened up, about whether this God is God for everybody or for the Hebrews only.

816
01:08:53,559 --> 01:09:18,520
I just can't resist telling you that with the podcast of people all over the world, two rabbis from Israel have written me, claiming that in my other course where I talk about this and say that the God is really only for the Hebrews, that I got it wrong, it's universal, and I can see that it became universal, and therefore retroactively saw itself as universal.

817
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,679
But it's a complicated question, yeah.

818
01:09:22,599 --> 01:09:25,799
God spares these people who aren't Hebrew.

819
01:09:25,959 --> 01:09:31,559
I mean, Jonah sent to tell them to repent for your sins or God's going to get destroyed.

820
01:09:31,559 --> 01:09:33,160
And Jonah does that.

821
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:35,160
God spares them.

822
01:09:35,959 --> 01:09:36,919
God says you spawned.

823
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:40,599
Okay, now, and where, what's the chronology of that?

824
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:47,520
How does that you know about the Exodus story?

825
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:52,639
How does that fit with the I have to repeat what you're saying?

826
01:09:52,639 --> 01:09:55,759
Exodus is one of the oldest texts, right, written even before Genesis.

827
01:09:55,759 --> 01:09:56,719
That I didn't know.

828
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:13,279
It's certainly, you either have to say that later on a more universal understanding of God evolved, or that they lost touch with this local kind of God and universal thinking took over.

829
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:17,520
I mean, that's probably a big debate that's still going on, I imagine, at least in my head.

830
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,400
Well, yeah.

831
01:10:20,559 --> 01:10:21,279
Right.

832
01:10:21,599 --> 01:10:22,159
Good.

833
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,120
I think that's right.

834
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:26,639
Well, I guess we're back to square one.

835
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:36,559
I mean, some Christians did, namely Paul, but James, another Christian, one of the disciples, didn't, if I was right.

836
01:10:36,559 --> 01:10:37,759
So it wasn't obvious.

837
01:10:37,759 --> 01:10:39,199
It was a problem.

838
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:50,480
And it's, it's a, and I see it, but that's just me, as a question of how much of the Greek categories, which were definitely universal, and that were always and got more and more influential.

839
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:58,320
And by the time you get to John, totally influential, you're going to use to try to articulate this religion.

840
01:10:58,639 --> 01:11:05,759
And as soon as you start using the Greek categories to articulate this religion, you're going to see it as a universal religion.

841
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:15,679
And at an earlier part, it looked like a tribal religion with its own private covenant with God.

842
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:19,119
And I'm trying to think that this is, yeah, go ahead.

843
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,839
He's God for everyone but the Hebrews?

844
01:11:21,839 --> 01:11:23,039
Who, which is?

845
01:11:23,999 --> 01:11:25,039
Jehovah?

846
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:27,599
The Christian God.

847
01:11:27,599 --> 01:11:30,119
God for everyone but the Hebrews.

848
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,639
Well, it could have come out that way, I guess.

849
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:34,759
I think it hasn't.

850
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:40,279
That's why I go back to these rabbis writing me from Israel telling me it's universal.

851
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:44,679
And it certainly now Judaism, I think, sees itself as universal.

852
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:46,520
I must be.

853
01:11:46,839 --> 01:11:55,719
Are there any, I don't know, are there any theologians of Judaism who sees it as a local, that is, as a religion for a people and only for them?

854
01:11:55,799 --> 01:11:58,759
They're not, as who said, not proselytizing, that's right.

855
01:11:58,759 --> 01:12:02,759
They're not going around saying you can't be, you should be one of us.

856
01:12:02,759 --> 01:12:04,360
They make it very difficult.

857
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:07,959
So that makes it seem like it still keeps its local character.

858
01:12:07,959 --> 01:12:10,360
And I sort of like that.

859
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:14,679
Well, luckily, we don't have to worry more about this.

860
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,959
And I think it's a fascinating question.

861
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:21,320
But let me just say this much, because there's only two minutes left.

862
01:12:21,559 --> 01:12:33,799
In Dante, you are now in a view where Christianity has taken itself to be absolutely universal, where it knows the truth about the universe.

863
01:12:33,799 --> 01:12:38,520
There are these pagans who didn't understand it, and there are these Hebrews who didn't fully understand it.

864
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,879
But finally, thanks to St.

865
01:12:41,879 --> 01:12:50,999
Thomas Aquinas and Dante, everybody will has to see that this is j the truth and that you have to get used to reading it that way.

866
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:54,919
That doesn't mean that the Hebrews have to read it that way, but the Christians certainly did.

867
01:12:54,919 --> 01:12:55,879
I saw one hand over here.

868
01:12:55,879 --> 01:12:56,599
Was it you, Dave?

869
01:12:56,599 --> 01:12:57,639
You just have your hand up.

870
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:58,119
You sure?

871
01:12:58,120 --> 01:12:58,759
We have a minute.

872
01:12:58,759 --> 01:13:00,360
Didn't I see a hand up somewhere?

873
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:01,400
You sure?

874
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:02,520
Everybody's happy?

875
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,799
Or at least ready to go?

876
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:04,599
Yes.

877
01:13:04,919 --> 01:13:06,199
Why was what?

878
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:07,639
Why are we discussing it?

879
01:13:07,879 --> 01:13:09,159
Well, that's a good question.

880
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:10,999
Not because it was brought up.

881
01:13:10,999 --> 01:13:11,799
That's why.

882
01:13:11,799 --> 01:13:14,639
It isn't anything you guys have to think about.

883
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:18,799
Nothing that we've talked about follows, it requires one way or the other.

884
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:27,759
That Jesus is a reconfigurer who changes the previous Hebrew understanding radically.

885
01:13:27,759 --> 01:13:29,839
That much is what we're talking about.

886
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:45,440
Whether what he discovers, what he produces when he changes it radically, is a new universal religion or a new version of the local religions is what the Hebrews themselves didn't, and we don't have to decide.

887
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:50,559
Nothing I said about reconfiguring is involved there.

888
01:13:50,559 --> 01:13:54,400
What is involved there, let me just say it again, is this other puzzling question.

889
01:13:54,400 --> 01:14:00,559
Did God change when Jesus, who was identical with him, so to speak, reconfigured him?

890
01:14:00,559 --> 01:14:04,480
That I have, that's something we should worry about, and I don't know what to say to you.

891
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:08,639
That could be local or universal, whatever answer you got to that one.

892
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:14,879
That is whether the local God changed or didn't change, or whether a universal God changed or didn't change.

893
01:14:14,879 --> 01:14:17,440
It's the same problem, I think.

894
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:17,919
Okay.
