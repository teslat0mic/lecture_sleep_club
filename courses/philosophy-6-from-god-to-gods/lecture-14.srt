1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,199
Okay, so we've heard some things already about the differences between these ways of being, being that we have seen the Homeric Greek, the Athens, and Rome.

2
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,960
In Homeric Greece, it was Thusis, it was nature taking over.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,439
In Athens, then it was Poiesis.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,239
It was bringing about what is in the material.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,359
It was the expressive way of being, cultivating and nurturing.

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:32,719
And then Professor Dreyfus has said that for the Romans, something else becomes most important, namely production.

7
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,879
And this is seen as a repressive and regulative and ordering way of being.

8
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:39,759
Order here is something imposed and invented.

9
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:48,719
People are not of the world or in the world in the same way that they were, but now they are in charge of the world.

10
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,799
And the new focus we could say maybe is on doing rather than on being perceptive to what's there.

11
00:00:54,799 --> 00:01:01,199
Now, I've said last time that from the point of view of the Roman at the time of Augustus, Rome is very, very successful.

12
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:10,199
The idea of world power is new, and this, of course, depends on the will to create a world or unify this world or order it.

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,360
And some of the new elements in this culture are: it's very cosmopolitan, it's expansive.

14
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,240
There's a new emotion that's pietas or duty.

15
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:28,520
There is a focus on valuing the status quo and stability while outward expanding.

16
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:38,839
A strong value is that there is a leader at the head of the state, and the idea of the nation or duty to the nation is more important than personal choice.

17
00:01:38,839 --> 00:01:46,920
And that's in turn tied to the idea of historical progress that can be extrapolated into the future, and then it is dependent on human.

18
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:52,999
Virgil is the one to glorify the new core value, pietas or duty.

19
00:01:52,999 --> 00:02:00,360
And in this, he is very self-referential because he himself is dutifully writing the Aeneid because he has been commissioned to do so.

20
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:12,760
Aeneas is creating, the Aeneid is creating the new emotion that it's portraying as a chief virtue, and in this sense, it is a self-referential and autopoetic work, much like the Orestea.

21
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,560
The one question that I have, though, is why does Virgil put so much weight on Dido?

22
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:20,839
What's the reason for that?

23
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:26,200
And I wondered that all along, because that was precisely the point that had been criticized in Roman times.

24
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:28,439
The Romans said, Well, this is about our culture.

25
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:34,439
Why do we have to hear so much about this foreign queen, this African ruler, this other way of being?

26
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,119
That seems wrong.

27
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:40,040
We want to hear about the Ur Roman, Aeneas.

28
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:43,240
And I think there are some structural reasons.

29
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:49,920
For example, it has a point for the frame narration that Aeneas comes to Dido's shore and can tell about his traveling.

30
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,559
But I think there is a deeper reason for the importance of Dido.

31
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:05,599
Dido seems to be the anti-Aeneas, and I think in a traditional interpretation, she's the perfect example of how you can most grandiosely fail in pietas.

32
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,800
She fails in showing that virtue.

33
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:27,600
And yet, I think that in her character, we can find a kernel of overcoming the Roman way of being because Dido is both pointing backwards to an older way of being and she's pointing forward to what is to come and to take over the Roman way of being.

34
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:42,400
So I think that in this idea of the imposed and invented order is already inherent the idea of imposing order on one's own life and inventing one's own fate rather than doing one's duty towards a given fate.

35
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,600
So this is how I think Dido and Aeneas are different.

36
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:55,360
Okay, but before we go on with Dido, I want to introduce some of the terms that are new and important for the Roman way of being.

37
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:03,839
So in the first 100 lines, we already see that there is a new God, very important, which is Fatum, which is fate.

38
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:09,040
And this God or this force is personified often as three fates, as three women.

39
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,439
And what they're doing is that they're making this thread of fate.

40
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:21,840
And they signify the new understanding of being, of being in charge of the world, because this order is thought much like this thretch that they're making.

41
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,720
It is sort of linear, as singular, stringent, straight-line, determined.

42
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:30,399
And again, that has to do with the idea of historical progress and the faith.

43
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:47,719
We can see that Fatum or the Fates are more important than the older gods because if you remember the beginning of the Aeneid, it's that Juno, who formerly was Hera in the Greek world, Carthage is her city, and she really wants Carthage to be successful.

44
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,759
And she wants Carthage to be the head of nations and to rule the world, and not Rome.

45
00:04:52,759 --> 00:05:01,080
And so she does everything she can to prolong the process of Rome being founded and Rome coming to a rise, but she can't stop it anymore.

46
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:08,199
All she can try to do is prolong this process and keep Aeneas away from the Italian shores.

47
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:13,240
But she has less power than Phartum, less power than the Fate.

48
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:20,999
Another important, I think, another interesting and important cultural force that is personified is Farma.

49
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:23,800
And you'll find her on page 85 of your version.

50
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,759
It's a very nice description of what Farma is.

51
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:30,040
I'll quote some.

52
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,440
Yeah.

53
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,079
Another, I knew there was one thing I wanted to talk about.

54
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,919
It turns out there are two different editions of this Aeneid.

55
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:47,079
Somebody came back after that they couldn't find on their pages the quotes that I was reading.

56
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:56,360
And it turns out that if you bought it new, you have different, roughly a page or two off from the broadband views.

57
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,639
How many have had trouble finding the quotes that I was giving you?

58
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,999
How many have not had trouble?

59
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:03,999
I just want to see little bit.

60
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,960
Okay, it's about 50-50.

61
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:12,600
So the only solution to that this year, next time, I'll know better, just say get rid of two years.

62
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:15,160
Just say Definitely 2, you could give something like a 2000 edition.

63
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,559
But in the meantime, we both have to give the line number.

64
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:19,999
We're going to give the book number.

65
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:21,920
It's always before 4, I take it now.

66
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:23,999
Now it's all four.

67
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,480
It's all four.

68
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,279
And if I don't do it again, remind me.

69
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:29,519
Okay.

70
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:42,319
So this would be in this edition on page 85, and it's lines roughly 230 to 260, where you find a very nice description of Farma, and I'm going to read some of it to you.

71
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,999
So then, swiftest of all evils, rumor runs straightway through Libya's mighty cities.

72
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:51,759
Rumor, whose life is speed, whose going gives her force.

73
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,360
Timid and small at first, she soon lifts up her body in the air.

74
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,240
She stalks the ground, her head is hidden in the clouds.

75
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:05,360
Provoked to anger at the gods, her mother earth gave birth to her, last come, they say, a sister to Koyos and Enceladus.

76
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:18,480
Fast-footed and light of wing, she's a terrifying, enormous monster, with as many feathers as she has sleepless eyes beneath each feather, amazingly as many sounding tongues and mouths, it raises up as many ears.

77
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,439
Between the earth and skies, she flies by night, screeching across the darkness, and she never closes her eyes in gentle sleep.

78
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:36,480
By day, she sits as sentinel on some steep roof or on high towers, frightening vast cities, for she holds fast to falsehood and distortion as often as to messages of truth.

79
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,480
So this is rumor or gossip that becomes important.

80
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:50,480
And I think that now in a changed societal circumstance, she becomes most important because we see here an awareness of public opinion.

81
00:07:50,479 --> 00:08:06,440
And since we have no democracy anymore, and there is, in this sense, no more role for the chorus, as we had it, of casting a ballot or participating, now what we have is this public opinion as an important force in societal life.

82
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:08,920
And I think the description is really wonderful.

83
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:20,759
And it's also Farma who will partially bring Dido down because at this point where we just quoted in 85, she is telling everybody about the affair that Dido is having with.

84
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:34,600
Okay, the last new force or the last new set of ideas that I want to introduce is tied to this new emotion, to pietas or duty, and it ties in very well with the new dominating philosophy, which is the Stoic philosophy.

85
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:44,520
And this is a very old school of philosophical thought that is already present in Greece, but then now it has adapted and changed to the Roman way of being.

86
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:57,319
And the Stoic philosophy is interesting for us because it has many elements that are then later incorporated into Christianity, whereas other elements of it will be cast out of Christianity.

87
00:08:57,319 --> 00:09:04,040
So for example, the Stoic philosophy accepts suicide, whereas in Christianity we'll see that it's not acceptable anymore.

88
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:10,680
And it is clearly the most important, it's the state philosophy at this time.

89
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,479
And I want to go over some of the important teachings of the Stoic philosophy.

90
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:16,680
Yeah, go ahead.

91
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:18,759
Stoic philosophy, yeah.

92
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:27,319
So the Stoic philosophy has all, it has a cosmology, it has a whole worldview and explanation of the science, but all of that we can't talk about right now.

93
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:32,120
All we want to talk about is their idea on emotions.

94
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:38,840
Because importantly, the Stoic says, well, you should calm your emotions and you should control them.

95
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:45,080
Because rightly understood, the emotions are direct consequences of a false judgment.

96
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:53,599
And if you falsely place value on outwards events that you don't have any influence over, then you will be very emotional about them.

97
00:09:53,599 --> 00:10:04,800
But since they don't really count because you can't do anything about them, you should just accept these events as they happen to you, and you will see that your emotions also cease to exist.

98
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,840
So it's the philosophy of non-emotionality.

99
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,079
And I think that's how we nowadays also use the term still.

100
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:18,000
If someone's very stoic, their stone face is non-emotional.

101
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:25,920
And just from that one element of their teaching, you can see that the result is the very obedient Aeneas.

102
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:34,480
And the store lends itself to be a state philosophy for the Augustan state because it does focus on the preservation of status quo.

103
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:41,200
As a stoic, you don't have much interest in changing the outward condition because you learn to accept whatever happens to you.

104
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,400
It has the idea of a certain determinism.

105
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:46,800
They have one image that I think is interesting.

106
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,640
They say, well, you are like a dog which is chained to a cart and the cart is moving forward.

107
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,000
Now, if you really want to, you can try to drag behind the cart and make your life really hard.

108
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:08,959
But you can't unchain yourself from the cart, so you might as well be smart and walk ahead of the cart and not hurt yourself and just accept the path that this card, your fate, is taking.

109
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:17,599
That's kind of one of the core images of the storage in a very simplified form.

110
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:22,480
I think it has more sophisticated elements, but for us, that's enough.

111
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:24,559
Okay, now I wanna.

112
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,600
These are some of the concepts to keep in mind when we now move on to the question: who's Dido?

113
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:39,800
Dido has from a Virgil's Dido has some sisters in the, or sisters in spirit in the Odyssey.

114
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,120
She's modeled according to some of the characters of the Odyssey.

115
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:50,359
So, if you remember, Nausicaa is the Phaekin princess that Odysseus encounters on the beach.

116
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:55,160
And with Nausica, she has in common that she's a potential bride for Aeneas.

117
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,559
Where Nausicaa was a potential bride for Odysseus, she's also a potential bride.

118
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:03,240
He could also stay there and remain with her and marry her.

119
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:10,040
Then she has an element of Kirke, of the witch or sorceress.

120
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,120
Cersei, yeah.

121
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:21,559
Cersei in the Odyssey because she is bewitching Aeneas to stay there, like Cersei did with Aeneas, or try to do with Aeneas.

122
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:34,360
And then I think another interesting element is that she is like Calypso, an older goddess who then is forced to let the hero go because the Olympians are sending for the hero.

123
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:41,639
In the legend, Dido is sometimes thought of as already a goddess when she's founding Carthage.

124
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:48,680
And sometimes she's thought of as a mortal who then later is deified after her death and worshipped in Carthage.

125
00:12:49,319 --> 00:13:04,280
And there is one nice historical person to compare her to, which is Cleopatra, because the scandalous affair that Antony had with Cleopatra is at that time, only 10 years passed.

126
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:17,600
So, all of the Roman readers remember that, and they remember that Antony and Cleopatra had a past and that they had a son, and that Augustus killed Antony, and Cleopatra killed herself, and he also killed a son.

127
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:28,559
So, the Roman reader has that very much in mind when he reads of Dido and wanting to have a family or a son with the Roman ruler.

128
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:38,160
Okay, but the most important comparison for us is between the two characters, Aeneas and Dido, which are the two central characters in book four.

129
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:49,600
And first, I want to point out that they are rather similar because they are both exiled and they're both founders of great cities or even civilizations.

130
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:53,440
Both are capable of ruling, both are strong characters.

131
00:13:53,439 --> 00:14:08,880
And initially, it's Dido's empathy for Aeneas' situation that she takes him in and says, Yeah, I'm going to give you shelter, I'm going to host you here, and I'm going to provide help for you to move on and found your city.

132
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,280
But then there is important differences between them.

133
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:20,720
Whereas we've seen that the title king isn't so very favorable for the Roman ear.

134
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:29,360
So, Aeneas is always portrayed as the founder of Rome, but not as the king, but rather as the everyman, whereas Dido is clearly the queen.

135
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,079
Then they have some characteristics that are different.

136
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:42,880
So, Aeneas is portrayed as reasonable, as temperate, whereas Dido is then portrayed as emotional, lustful, and violent.

137
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:50,080
And Aeneas fulfills his duty despite his love, whereas for Dido, it's the other way around.

138
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,720
She loves despite of her duty.

139
00:14:54,719 --> 00:15:04,520
For Aeneas, the most important emotion is pietas or duty, and for Dido it is fur or anger or madness.

140
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:10,920
Then they have a difference in the gods that are affiliated to them.

141
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:22,120
And I think Professor Raff is going to talk more about that because Aeneas defines himself as the carrier of the house gods, which is a set of gods that travel with him and that he needs to find or found a city for them.

142
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:28,440
Whereas Dido is invoking the old gods and her protectress is you know.

143
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:38,360
Aeneas could be seen as the or Roman, whereas Dido can be seen or read as anti-Roman in the sense that she's not very pious.

144
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:43,000
And then these qualities that I've pointed out, she's just not pious queen.

145
00:15:44,599 --> 00:15:49,000
I think that we can give each of them a line that best describes them.

146
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,840
Aeneas says, I'm pious Aeneas, thereby saying, well, I am my fate.

147
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,319
This is who I am.

148
00:15:57,319 --> 00:16:07,879
And there is a wonderful later version of Dido in an opera by Purcell where she sings in an aria, remember me but forget my fate.

149
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:12,680
So thereby she says, me and my fate, these are two things.

150
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,360
They're not one.

151
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:36,920
And when I talked about this lecture with Professor Dreyfus, we had a funny, we came to a funny moment because he had remembered the line as the following, that Dido says, remember my fate but forget me, which would be very Roman, a very Roman way of putting it, because what's really important for the Romans is the faith.

152
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:42,920
And the individual choice or the individual relation to it is not that important.

153
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:48,559
But so when Dido says, remember me, but forget my fate, this is what I've been trying to understand.

154
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:53,039
Why does she say that, and how does that relate to the Roman way of being?

155
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,519
That brings me to part four, which is Dido's love.

156
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:06,719
If you read book four, a lot of the times the love is portrayed as something that is like a wound.

157
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:15,920
It has a lot of similes to the spear in her side, it's like a fever, it's madness, it's even an infection or a poison.

158
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:29,920
If you imagine, if you remember the scene where Cupid is inducing the love to Dido, all night he's sitting, he is disguised as I neither son, and he's sitting on her lap, and he's blowing these poisonous fumes into her.

159
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:37,680
So it's a rather negative imagery, and I'm trying to understand what we can make of that.

160
00:17:37,999 --> 00:17:49,839
Of course, if you look from the point of view of the Stoa, and the Stoa promotes non-emotionality and self-control and control the Stoics, yeah.

161
00:17:50,160 --> 00:18:17,279
If the Stoics promote non-emotionality, of course, the love is something very negative because it's coming from the outside, it's induced from the outside, and Dido really lets herself go into this emotion, whereas she should realize that it's something outside of herself and that she should fight it back and not give into it because she should see that it's of no value in the Stoic way of thinking.

162
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,999
But she doesn't, therefore, she's very anti-Stoic.

163
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,160
There's also some external reasons for the love.

164
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,559
It's the conspiracy between Juno and Venus via Cupid as the inducer of the love.

165
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:37,640
And then I think you could give a very understandable and reasonable psychological explanation of the love story.

166
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:46,759
If you think of Dido, she is the great queen and she has dedicated her life to founding a great city and serving her country.

167
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:58,759
But now she is pretty lonely and she doesn't have children and now along comes dashing Aeneas and it's just very understandable that she now would recognize the old flames of love that as she says herself.

168
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:15,559
So the emotions would be she's lonely, she's lustful and desirous and then we would interpret her love as an inner conflict between two commitments between duty and love in the psychological rendering of the story.

169
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:35,400
Then there's also some prudential reasons for her love because as her sister Anna points out to her at the beginning, Anna says, well, it wouldn't actually not be so bad if you were to marry this foreign king because our city-state has been threatened by these tribes all the time.

170
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:42,599
So if we would have some more backup, if you'd have a king, you would strengthen our kingdom or your queendom.

171
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:49,559
So it's not only emotionality, but it's also that Dido as a good queen falls for Aeneas.

172
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,160
Okay, so what's the outcome of the story?

173
00:19:53,160 --> 00:20:03,479
As you've read, it is that Dido and Aeneas fall in love, or at least Dido falls in love with Aeneas, and they consummate what Dido perceives as their marriage.

174
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:05,479
For Aeneas, it isn't that.

175
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:12,839
Then Aeneas gets many dreams and signs from Venus that it's now time to go, that he has to leave and has to found Rome.

176
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:18,079
And he tells Dido that and then flees at night.

177
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:26,559
And Dido is mad and raging, and she is making up her mind of what to do now.

178
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:38,719
And she prepares a big cleansing ritual, a big fire, and burns herself or sacrifices herself on this fire because Aeneas has left her.

179
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:46,720
And before she dies, she makes a big curse where she curses Rome and Carthage to have to be enemies.

180
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:58,880
I think to understand the Dido story, we have to look at two other moments or two moments at Dido's death and how it is portrayed and at Dido's place in the underworld.

181
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:08,959
So, first, if you look at the description of Dido's death, it is said that it's neither fateful nor is it merited, and it is untimely.

182
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:19,039
So, if you remember, the underworld's not really ready for her, that's why her soul can't leave her body, and we have to send for Iris to come down and help her leave her body.

183
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,439
And before she kills herself, she calls all of the gods for witnesses.

184
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:31,680
And I think that's an interesting moment because she does not what the gods want, and she also does not do what fate has in store for her.

185
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:39,040
And despite the fact that she neither does what the gods want, nor what her fate is, the gods don't condemn her.

186
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,719
And she's warned by her sister, but she's never condemned.

187
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:50,479
And then we have another encounter with Dido in the underworld, where Aeneas goes to the underworld and he meets with Dido.

188
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,000
And what happens is that Dido doesn't even talk to him.

189
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:58,079
She looks at him, but then she turns back and goes away.

190
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:04,039
And Aeneas is full of pity and full of tears and says, Talk to me, this is the last time we'll see each other.

191
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:07,560
And she doesn't want to talk with him.

192
00:22:07,719 --> 00:22:10,840
But he says, well, I've simply done what fate had me do.

193
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,359
I had to do it.

194
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,120
And in my interpretation, I think that her choice is much better.

195
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:20,439
I think that she made the much more resolute and interesting choice and sticks with it.

196
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:23,640
And that's what I'm going to talk about next.

197
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,640
I think that it's not Aeneas who's great in the scene, but it's really Dido.

198
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:32,439
And I also don't suppose that we are to feel pity for Dido.

199
00:22:32,439 --> 00:22:34,279
I think that she's not to be pitied.

200
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:43,319
Okay, in concluding, I think that Virgil's Aeneas is as a work as a work of art because it does unify the Roman way of life.

201
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:48,039
And this can be also shown in its popularity and its authority.

202
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:57,799
It is a work of art because it's self-referential and autopoetic in the sense that it does create the emotion that it presupposes as a core value.

203
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:12,039
And then in this sense, if you remember that I talked about the myths of the failed authorship, I think that this is more than just an anecdotal embellishment because it really becomes a work with which the culture itself is creating.

204
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:27,479
And for the new reading that I'm giving of Dido, it's not essential whether Virgil intended for this or not, but it's essential that these elements can be present or can be thought of present in the way of being.

205
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:28,199
T.S.

206
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:36,359
Eliot once described the meeting of Dido and Aeneas in the underworld, as the most civilized moment in Western literature.

207
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,959
And he said that in a lecture in 1944, in what the lecture was called What is a Classic?

208
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:46,039
And he said, well, why is it the most civilized moment in all of Western literature?

209
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:52,559
Because Aeneas does not forgive himself, although he did all that fate wanted him to do.

210
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,079
And in my eyes, this is the wrong approach of understanding it.

211
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:04,400
I think this is why Aeneas' choice remains inauthentic and is a worse choice than Dido's choice.

212
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,320
Okay, so now these are some terms that we have to understand.

213
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,880
It's the term inauthentic choice, authentic choice, and towards a way of being.

214
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:19,920
And I'm sure maybe Professor Jarves can help us understand these terms a little better.

215
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:29,920
But so, if you come from an Heideggerian understanding, every way of being that you see has three potential stances toward it.

216
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:36,640
You can either be indifferent, or you can choose inauthentically, or you can choose authentically.

217
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,439
This is kind of the way you put, as I think about it, you position yourself towards that way of being.

218
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:44,559
And it can be either in three ways.

219
00:24:45,519 --> 00:25:09,200
If you are indifferent, this would be a way that you've never come to question your social role, or you've never experienced any unrest or unsettlement about the roles that are potential for you, and you've never really thought about the finitude of your being, but you just go on with everything as you're born into the order and the way of being.

220
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:11,920
You just continue it without questions.

221
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:16,800
And Heidegger does stress that it's not that being indifferent is not a negative.

222
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:44,199
It's the other two things that are interesting to me here because the inauthentic choice is one, let's say now in puberty, you suddenly realize that you are mortal and you this great unsettledness comes over you and you're very anxious about your existence and now what you do is you choose a social role but you do that as though you reach for a life preserver while drowning.

223
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:52,039
You choose this role and you really stick to that role because thereby you can settle your anxiety.

224
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:54,920
And that would be an inauthentic choice.

225
00:25:55,239 --> 00:26:12,119
And then the last option is an authentic choice in which your anxiety would remain, in which you would be aware that this role can't save you from it, but that you would express that in the way that you accept that role or that you act that role.

226
00:26:12,439 --> 00:26:19,880
And now my reading or my thesis is that Aeneas acts inauthentic and Dido acts authentic.

227
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:30,759
I think Aeneas remains inauthentic because he only goes along with his duty, it's not really chosen and he is like this dog dragged by the cart.

228
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:38,439
And I think that Dido is authentic because she actively chooses her stance and sees her situation.

229
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:46,119
And she has a little monologue with herself where she weighs all of her options.

230
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:54,199
If you go to page ninety-seven and that's the line seven hundred thirty-eight, I will read it to you.

231
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,879
She will not let things rest but carries on.

232
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,999
She still resolves these thoughts within her heart.

233
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:01,800
What can I do?

234
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:11,640
Shall I, whom he has mocked, go back again to my old suitors begging, seeking a wedding with Nemedians, whom I've already often scorned as bridegrooms?

235
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,680
Or should I sail away to on Trojan ships to suffer their even their harshest orders?

236
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:25,599
Shall I do so because the Trojans once received my help and gratefully for such old service, gratefulness for such old service is remembered by the mindful?

237
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,239
But even if I wish it, would they welcome someone so hated to their haughty ships?

238
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:35,039
For a lost one, do you not yet know, not feel the treason of the breed of Laomedon?

239
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:35,600
What then?

240
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:43,439
Shall I accompany alone the exultant sailor in their flight, or call on all my Tyrions, on all my troops to rush upon them?

241
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:46,079
How can I urge on those I once dragged from Zedon?

242
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,439
How can I now force them back again upon the sea and have them spread their canvas to the winds?

243
00:27:51,439 --> 00:27:55,519
No, die as you deserve and set aside your sorrow by the sword.

244
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,400
So this doesn't seem to me very furious.

245
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:04,480
It seems to me like someone really thinking about, well, what is it really that I can do?

246
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:08,959
What is it that my social role and my historical circumstance allow for?

247
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:14,079
And she then takes a stand and says, this is what I'm going to do.

248
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,320
And I think that is what she means when she says, remember me, but forget my fate.

249
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,079
I don't think that she means an essential quality about herself, something inner.

250
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:31,199
And I don't think that she means her role as queen, but what I think she means is that she has taken a certain stance towards that role.

251
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:36,160
And in my interpretation, that is a very authentic and interesting choice.

252
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:49,640
And it's interesting to see that all the things that in the Stoic light we've characterized as negative, all the anxiety, all the fur war, all the anguish, burning, feeling of entrapment, that all that is necessary to help her realize that.

253
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,280
Great.

254
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:51,079
Thanks.

255
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,199
Okay, you're good, yeah.

256
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,880
Oh, yeah.

257
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:56,920
Thanks, Beatrice.

258
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:06,120
And now I have sort of several different things to do, and I have to try to figure out which way to do them.

259
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,959
First, I think I have to respond to what Beatrice just said.

260
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:15,239
I mean, we could have, if there were time, a kind of debate, because we do disagree.

261
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,680
I think I disagree half with what Beatrice said, not all of it.

262
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:28,599
Let me sum up what I, because you may not have seen what I'm disagreeing with.

263
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,439
I think I have understood it.

264
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:35,320
I mean, because I know these distinctions of authentic and inauthentic.

265
00:29:35,719 --> 00:29:37,400
I have to say one word about that.

266
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,840
Don't get confused.

267
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:48,199
When Heidegger talks about being authentic and inauthentic, he doesn't mean that you can take a stand on your culture's understanding of being, because that's too pervasive.

268
00:29:48,199 --> 00:30:13,080
And unless you're a super genius who can transform your culture completely, like in a way Jesus does, you have to live in the understanding of being that you've got, just like we've got an understanding of being of pretty much everything being under our control and flexible, and we can use any old thing and then throw it away and so forth.

269
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,080
I could talk more about that later.

270
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:26,599
But what the authentic and inauthentic would be is how you relate to your particular situation and your circumstances.

271
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:36,280
And Heidegger does think that you can, in your situation, you can just do what anyone in your culture with your understanding of being would do.

272
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:48,400
That would be to be inauthentic, to just take over a role and follow it as a way of getting off having to make any decisions really on your own.

273
00:30:48,719 --> 00:31:00,959
Or you can take over the unique situation, as he puts it, and respond to the current situation and sort of what it calls for you to do.

274
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:24,000
Now, Nietzsche says that Aeneas is inauthentic because he just takes over what fate, what role fate has given him and does it, and moreover, uses an excuse for how absolutely shabbily and terribly he's treated Dido.

275
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:31,039
It's just amazing and how dense he is with respect to Dido and how she's suffering.

276
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:39,999
But the question is: is Aeneas just hiding, so to speak, behind this notion of faith and taking over this role?

277
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:42,160
Well, there's where I want to disagree with her.

278
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:53,439
From Virgil's point of view, and I think probably Stoic point of view, though I don't know enough about Stoicism to know for sure, you don't need to bring in fate at all.

279
00:31:53,439 --> 00:32:00,719
Fate is just another way of describing somebody's character.

280
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:03,920
And Aeneas' character is to be pious.

281
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,000
It's not just his fate to be pious.

282
00:32:05,999 --> 00:32:08,400
He's just that kind of person.

283
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:21,759
And where pious means to respect the tradition and do what is considered the best, most responsible, dutiful thing to do.

284
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:33,479
And what he, and he's, and the other half of fate is, given the kind of character you've got, you're going to be put into some situation or other.

285
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:38,279
And you can't choose your character.

286
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:41,319
Aeneas can't choose whether to be pious or not.

287
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:50,439
You've all got your characters, all of you, whether you're going to have interiority complexes or superiority or being nurturing or being aggressive and so forth.

288
00:32:51,320 --> 00:33:00,839
People, you've got to take the character that you've been dealt, so to speak, and that's why it seems to be your fate.

289
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,640
And you've got to take the situation you've been dealt.

290
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:12,120
That you can't just be a Buddhist hermit or something.

291
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:22,360
You've got to deal with the situation you've got, being a 21st century American male or female and so forth.

292
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:25,480
And Aeneas does what he has to do.

293
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:51,080
Having a character of being a dutiful person and having put in the situation of being the leader of the totally demolished, the remains of the totally demolished Trojan city, he does exactly what he has to do.

294
00:33:51,560 --> 00:34:06,999
It would make no sense for him, as pious Aeneas, to just drop what he's doing and stay with Dido because he loves her, because he really feels very happy with her and so forth.

295
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:28,239
His situation requires his character plus his situation as the saving person who is going to save Troy and turn it into something new and turns out very successful, namely Rome, makes him behave in this terrible way he does toward Dido.

296
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:57,600
So I think my reading of Aeneas is that it's not that he's inauthentic in taking up the role that his character and his situation have given him, it's that he's so obtuse about how he treats Dido in the light of it, and therefore uses this fate, where fate means, given his character and given his situation, he's got to leave her and he's got to leave Carthage.

297
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,000
He uses it in a way to treat her unbelievably, sort of.

298
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,040
It isn't even brutally, it's just dumb.

299
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,439
I will read my favorite line, which seems to be a kind of joke, to tell you what's wrong with Aeneas.

300
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,519
I mean, I want to say Aeneas is authentic.

301
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:18,239
Aeneas at the first, I think he does what he has to do.

302
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:26,320
He does not take the way out of doing what any old person would normally do in some routine way.

303
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,600
And he responds to his situation exactly the way he has to respond to it.

304
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,360
But he certainly doesn't respond to it, Dido, that way.

305
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,920
I want to read, I have to find it.

306
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:44,000
This is all not what I intended to say, but Beatrice is challenging me to say it.

307
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:51,839
Can anybody find the last thing Aeneas says when he leaves Dido?

308
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,960
Now let's see.

309
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,600
Is it 79?

310
00:35:57,919 --> 00:35:58,399
No?

311
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,239
It's later than me.

312
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:01,880
Here it is, 92.

313
00:36:01,879 --> 00:36:02,599
Okay.

314
00:36:03,879 --> 00:36:04,680
This is.

315
00:36:01,279 --> 00:36:07,239
Everybody has their own take on it.

316
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:10,120
I mean, this turns out to be not important.

317
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:14,599
I mean, I don't care whether Aeneas is absolutely dodo and dense.

318
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,839
I mean, neither does Virgil.

319
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:18,199
Yeah, over here, too.

320
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,640
Okay, good, good.

321
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,239
What, are you on the same book I am?

322
00:36:21,319 --> 00:36:23,000
Yes, I haven't got the right pages.

323
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:24,999
Okay, let me give you the pages.

324
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:37,080
So we're in book four still, and I'm going to read from, well, I'm going to read line 460, and then I'm going to read more from whatever I said.

325
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,560
I'll go when I get there.

326
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:40,760
Okay.

327
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:49,800
You know, the one on page 90 of the new one, but now I've got you're all on, we're on 460.

328
00:36:49,799 --> 00:36:55,480
Here's his last words to Dido to explain what he has done.

329
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:04,280
And what, and the sort of excuse, and this is where Beatrice seems to me to be on the right track somehow, the way he uses fate as an excuse.

330
00:37:04,279 --> 00:37:10,600
I mean, fate, I think, is something he's got to follow because he's got the character he's got and the situation he's got.

331
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:20,600
But he doesn't have to use it as an excuse to not even have to take any blame or feel any sense of responsibility for Dido.

332
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,360
So he says, the bottom 90 to Dido.

333
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:35,840
If fate had granted me to guide my life by my own auspices and to unravel my troubles with unhampered will.

334
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,040
Then, now don't just stop at that.

335
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,239
Then, why?

336
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:41,239
What are you expecting him to say?

337
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:42,680
Here's this girlfriend.

338
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,319
Here, she's given everything to him.

339
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:47,520
She's totally dependent on him.

340
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,640
He's leaving her.

341
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,400
And he says, If fate had granted me another way of living my life, then I would.

342
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:55,440
What?

343
00:37:55,759 --> 00:38:01,199
What would anybody normally sensible or considerate person say?

344
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:01,680
What?

345
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:03,520
Stay with you.

346
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,719
Yeah, why not?

347
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:06,079
I mean, he has to leave.

348
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:11,199
The least he could say to her is, boy, if I didn't have to leave, I would love to stay with you.

349
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:12,480
And what does he say?

350
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,719
Then I would cherish the first town of Troy, the sweet remains of my own people.

351
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:19,199
The tall rooftops of crime would remain.

352
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:23,919
My hand would plant again the second Pergamosis and the second Troy, and so forth.

353
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:30,239
So no matter what, whether I obeyed fate or whether I didn't obey faith, I would certainly leave you.

354
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,719
That's his parting words.

355
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,879
That's what I think is wrong with him.

356
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:36,079
But it doesn't matter.

357
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,399
What's right about him is what Virgil likes.

358
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:45,839
He's the perfect stoic person, absolutely doing what his character and what his situation requires.

359
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,119
My reading.

360
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:54,160
So we now have, now I see what else I want to say about this.

361
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:01,280
Oh, well, now I just want to talk more about Aeneid for a minute, just to back up what I've been saying.

362
00:39:01,279 --> 00:39:04,320
He just defines himself as pious.

363
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:06,080
That's his character.

364
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,560
There's nothing more to be said about it.

365
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:21,759
On page 9 of this, we're in book one, just at the top of 310, especially the pious Aeneas.

366
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,680
That isn't quite what I want.

367
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,879
Where does he say, I am pious Aeneas?

368
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,160
If that's his identity, he introduces himself that way.

369
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,680
Well, let's try another place.

370
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:34,919
He says that he's pious, all right.

371
00:39:34,919 --> 00:39:36,439
He's pious Aeneas.

372
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:41,800
But I thought there's a place, we'll see, where he announces that that's what he is.

373
00:39:41,799 --> 00:39:44,520
But I have to say more now about what it is to be pious.

374
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:52,280
I have to talk a little bit about Aeneas before I get to the underworld, just because you've got to get some little more view of him.

375
00:39:52,520 --> 00:40:02,520
To be pious is to respect the tradition and your duty.

376
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:13,559
Which, and that was coming out in the speech with Dido, because he either wants to go back to Troy and revive the tradition in the past, if he could, but fate doesn't allow him to do that.

377
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,919
Yeah, okay.

378
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:17,399
This is where he says he's pious Aeneas.

379
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:18,840
Good on it.

380
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,279
Yes, that's what I wanted.

381
00:40:20,279 --> 00:40:25,719
14 for the line 534, I am pious Aeneas.

382
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:28,279
And I'm going to go on and talk about what else, but I'll read it now.

383
00:40:28,279 --> 00:40:29,399
I have to explain it more.

384
00:40:29,399 --> 00:40:34,840
I'm pious Aeneas, and I carry in my ships my household gods together with me and so forth.

385
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:43,640
Well, to be pious first is either to take up the tradition and go back to Troy and rebuild it.

386
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,320
That would be pious.

387
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:55,879
Or to take up this other role and have a future, build a new future for the remaining, for his son, and so forth.

388
00:40:55,879 --> 00:41:02,600
And you can see this in this beautiful theme that you can constantly see Virgil working from.

389
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,799
I don't know, yes, even here, no, not here.

390
00:41:04,799 --> 00:41:07,719
On the cover, I see that his son is there.

391
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:10,760
But what he's got is his father on his back.

392
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:11,799
That's the tradition.

393
00:41:11,799 --> 00:41:15,719
He carries his father and always has his father with him.

394
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:17,440
And his son, by the hand.

395
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:24,640
The father on his back is his loyalty to the tradition, the past, and the son in his hand is his loyalty to the future.

396
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:55,040
It's sort of, you know, two generations away from, I was one generation away from the same kind of thing where, sort of, after the Depression in the United States, generally, because it's a country for immigrants, never mind the Depression, there's always this idea that the parents' job is to build a better future for their child, that they're going to do, the child is going to do better, be more educated, more successful, more happy than their parents.

397
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,800
He's got that.

398
00:41:56,799 --> 00:42:01,760
He's going to, that's his dedication to the future.

399
00:42:01,759 --> 00:42:04,560
Now, there's another person, and again, it's like a joke.

400
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,640
There is another person besides the past, which is his father, and the future, which is his son.

401
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,760
Who's that?

402
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:13,759
That he should be carrying out of Troy.

403
00:42:13,919 --> 00:42:16,800
You'll miss anybody in the family picture?

404
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,479
His wife.

405
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,160
What happened to his wife?

406
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,400
Well, she's with him, walking along behind, we're told.

407
00:42:24,399 --> 00:42:26,079
But then they just lose her.

408
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,199
Virgil doesn't even tell us how they lose her or when they lose her.

409
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:34,000
Just one day they seem to have sort of walked off and she's not there.

410
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:39,999
And I see this, but this isn't just an accident or stupidity on the part of Aeneas.

411
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,359
This is something deep.

412
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,840
There's really no place for her.

413
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,239
Because, and here's how you want to picture it, I think.

414
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:50,719
Aeneas only cares about the past and the future.

415
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:53,120
He doesn't care about the present.

416
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,960
His wife would be the present.

417
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,399
His present enjoyment, his present comfort.

418
00:42:58,399 --> 00:43:04,119
All he's got is this heavy load on his back, which is his father, and his nice son by the hand.

419
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:10,840
So there's this thing from Lewis Carroll, which I always think about when I think about Aeneas.

420
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,239
Jam, what is it?

421
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:17,400
Jam yesterday and jam tomorrow, but never jam today.

422
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:21,799
That is, he's got, he would be happy to go back to the past.

423
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:29,800
He would go be happy, he is happy building up the future, but he can't take time out to enjoy the present.

424
00:43:29,799 --> 00:43:32,120
Now, one last thing about that.

425
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:42,840
What would be the greatest danger for somebody like that who has this double sense of either going to Troy or going on to found Rome?

426
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:48,680
Well, we just seen the villain is that, from that perspective, is Dido.

427
00:43:48,680 --> 00:44:03,479
Not because she's a bad person, but because she represents living in the present, happily, sensually, relaxed, and stopping worrying about founding Rome and stopping worrying about going back to Troy.

428
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,080
That would be a disaster.

429
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:18,600
And it's just because she's so sensual and such a good ruler and so smart and so beautiful that she represents this big threat to him, and he just has to sacrifice her and leave.

430
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:22,600
So, okay, so much I think is all I want to have time to say about that.

431
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,719
Let's see.

432
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:34,919
But Dido, I just want to say the point that Beatrice is making, which I think is interesting and important, is there's something special about Dido.

433
00:44:34,919 --> 00:44:37,800
She's been sort of set up by the gods.

434
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:44,359
She's, another point that Beatrice didn't mention, she's had this first husband whom she was completely devoted to.

435
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:45,919
Is that his name, I think?

436
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,120
And who died?

437
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:52,560
So she is a very, very lonely widow.

438
00:44:52,560 --> 00:45:05,120
And she still feels the old erotic and romantic love for this first husband, so that she's never been interested in any other man until Aeneas comes along.

439
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:09,040
And when Aeneas comes along, Beatrice mentioned it, I just want to repeat it.

440
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,480
She feels the ancient flames.

441
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:25,760
That is, she feels the first time she feels desire and romance and dependent on somebody else, a man.

442
00:45:25,759 --> 00:45:31,040
And that's what destroys her.

443
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,239
But now I get to what Beatrice said that I thought was important.

444
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:36,719
She does do something interesting.

445
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:39,760
She takes control of her own destiny.

446
00:45:39,759 --> 00:45:44,320
After going through all the options, she decides that she's got to kill herself.

447
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,919
That's, I mean, she could have decided that she's got to kill Aeneas.

448
00:45:47,919 --> 00:45:51,680
She considered that, getting her army and attacking his army.

449
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,799
She could have considered that she could, you know, what?

450
00:45:56,799 --> 00:45:58,239
Well, anyway, whatever.

451
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,000
She has decided, she took over control of her life.

452
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:14,560
I think if you want to read something interesting into that, as Beatrice does, it's that Virgil is sensing sort of an extrapolation of their current understanding of being.

453
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:21,360
That is, the way prophets can see into the future because they're in tune with the understanding of being.

454
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:22,639
How could she be doing that?

455
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,120
Well, their understanding of being is control.

456
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,359
What she's done is what he's done in Beatrice.

457
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:43,800
Sorry, what he's done in Dino is push the control thing one step further and say, you shouldn't just let your character and your situation tell you what you have to do.

458
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,360
She's taken control of her life.

459
00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:48,759
And she's decided on her own.

460
00:46:48,759 --> 00:46:59,959
That's the next stage, or really two stages later in the understanding of being, where we all think that an authentic person ought to take control of their life.

461
00:47:00,279 --> 00:47:14,120
And in that way, so she is a marginal prediction of where this control of everything is going to lead.

462
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:29,160
It's going to lead to Kant, and I mention every once in a while when we're talking about the Odyssey, and autonomy, where you are totally in control of your life and the meaning of your life, and you can give whatever meaning you want to your character, you can give whatever meaning you want to your situation.

463
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,680
Dido is perhaps a mood in that direction.

464
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,680
Okay, that's all I can say about that.

465
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:38,360
But now you've been talked to by both of us for a long time.

466
00:47:38,359 --> 00:47:43,400
If anybody has anything they want to say about this, you should certainly say it.

467
00:47:43,719 --> 00:47:44,199
Yeah.

468
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:45,719
Yeah.

469
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:46,519
No.

470
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,719
I worried about that, that somebody would say that.

471
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:53,320
It happens to be a good thing to do.

472
00:47:53,319 --> 00:47:57,559
Some of the best Roman Stoics commit suicide, and it's very admirable.

473
00:47:57,799 --> 00:47:58,999
It's another culture.

474
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:07,239
It's just like the weird thing of bringing home a mistress like Cassandra did, just introducing her to your wife the way Agamemnon does.

475
00:48:07,879 --> 00:48:09,480
Their cultures are different.

476
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:15,800
And it's still suicide was considered a heroic and honorable and brave thing to do.

477
00:48:15,799 --> 00:48:20,560
That's a very big difference between the Romans and the positive life.

478
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,999
I know you're being ironic, but it's something that's how it sounds.

479
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,479
I know Buddhists don't believe you should commit suicide.

480
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,120
It's wrong.

481
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:30,640
Christians don't.

482
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,719
Jews don't either.

483
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:42,559
I don't know if any culture now does, but the Stoics certainly thought suicide was okay, more than okay, honorable, heroic, practically.

484
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,399
So that's that I have to put that in.

485
00:48:44,399 --> 00:48:46,000
I'm glad you asked.

486
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,919
Now I better go right away.

487
00:48:47,919 --> 00:48:49,600
No, no, I have one more thing I have to do.

488
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,960
So many things to do.

489
00:48:51,120 --> 00:49:06,000
In on page 14, that is on book one, line 535, there's the other half of the sentence where he says, I am pious Aeneas, and I carry in my ships my household gods together with me.

490
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,640
That should strike you as interesting.

491
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:14,239
I mean, since this course is about gods, and since he's defining, what a weird thing to say.

492
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:17,440
I mean, he could have said, I'm here with my father and my son.

493
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:22,320
I mean, I've loved this place my life, but I had one once.

494
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:24,480
But he doesn't say that.

495
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,840
He says, I'm here, and I've got the household gods.

496
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:32,399
Well, I wish I could tell you something exciting about the household gods, and I'm working on it.

497
00:49:32,399 --> 00:49:34,080
I'm trying to understand them.

498
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:39,520
How do they spell T-E-N-P-A-Pen case is what they're called.

499
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:44,639
If you will find anything about them, say, with the encyclopedia or something, let me know.

500
00:49:44,879 --> 00:49:46,160
I thought I'd look there.

501
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:46,799
Yes.

502
00:49:46,799 --> 00:49:48,640
P-E-N-T-E-S.

503
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,359
I think it's just T-E-S.

504
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,120
How do you spell pencils?

505
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,639
Anybody know?

506
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,560
I looked in the back.

507
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,359
I couldn't find it.

508
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:58,640
Maybe Beatrice, Euchar.

509
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:00,079
I looked under P-D-N.

510
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,999
P-E-S, well, maybe with an age computer.

511
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,799
Maybe probably E.

512
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,319
Who knows?

513
00:50:05,319 --> 00:50:13,239
Anyway, those household gods, which I promise to bring in any information I find out, I know this much from trying to find out about them.

514
00:50:13,799 --> 00:50:15,239
People don't talk about them much.

515
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:17,160
But obviously they're very important.

516
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,760
The only thing he saves from Troy is the household gods.

517
00:50:20,759 --> 00:50:23,239
Well, it's not unrelated to what I just said.

518
00:50:23,239 --> 00:50:26,280
The household gods are another version of the past.

519
00:50:26,279 --> 00:50:28,199
They are the ancestors.

520
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:30,680
That much I can find out.

521
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:34,439
And naturally, that's like having your father on your back.

522
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:38,600
That's the tradition that you have to be true to the...

523
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:44,680
And your identity comes in large part from who your ancestors have been.

524
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:58,440
You say, you know, that I, my father, you hear a lot about that in a minute, how the whole history of all the ancestors of Augustus makes Augustus the important person he is.

525
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,079
So anyway, he's carrying with him these ancestors.

526
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:08,839
What I'd like to know is, Beatrice pictures them as all looking the same, like the pool of furies.

527
00:51:08,839 --> 00:51:16,680
I really picture them like little models of grandpa and great-grandfather and great-grandmother, and they look exactly like your ancestors.

528
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,120
I have no idea.

529
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:19,479
Somebody ought to know.

530
00:51:20,199 --> 00:51:26,680
After all, there's lots of pottery and stuff left around, and I'll find out.

531
00:51:26,919 --> 00:51:30,520
It doesn't fit into any of the God story we're talking about.

532
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,280
Well, maybe it does.

533
00:51:32,279 --> 00:51:34,599
Just final far-fetched thing.

534
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,999
I'm sort of talking in a vacuum about them.

535
00:51:37,239 --> 00:51:51,680
I mean, if they are what I think they are, the sense of the history of that family, they're like many, many works of art, many, many gods.

536
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:09,199
If gods are what focuses and holds up to you what your culture is all about, and you see things in its light, these ought to focus and hold up to the people, like Aeneas, what he's up to.

537
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:15,040
To each person, has their family gods, which sort of they take out the ones that are important.

538
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:23,040
And the ones that are important, those family gods, are the ones that hold up to them what gives their family its identity.

539
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,960
And in the light of that, they see what's important to do.

540
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,520
So they do have a god-like character.

541
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,159
And of course, that's tied up with their being sacred.

542
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,519
They're certainly sacred.

543
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:40,320
As I think I've said before, Nietzsche says that every culture has something sacred at which you are not allowed to laugh.

544
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,960
And it's surely the household gods.

545
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,920
And so we have to figure out why they should be sacred and why they should be so important.

546
00:52:47,919 --> 00:52:56,719
And I think it's because they give you a sense of, they give the person a sense of who they are and what their personal world is.

547
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:03,599
Okay, now I really have to go to the underworld part because it's so important for Dante.

548
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:08,320
I can come back to it when we get to Dante, but I'm going to do some of it now.

549
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:22,400
So don't worry about all the names, the battles, the places, and everything, but you have to pay attention to the mainly sort of what happens to the people in the underworld.

550
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:32,680
And then you'll understand a lot more about the Stoics if you contrast it with the underworld that we do know already, the underworld and the Odyssey.

551
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:37,399
It's like the absolute reverse of the underworld and the Odyssey.

552
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:46,439
It just shows you how far the understanding of being of these Stoic Romans is from the understanding of the heroic Greeks.

553
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:52,359
I mean, aescholicism isn't really important in this because we don't see what the underworld looks like for Aeschylus.

554
00:53:52,359 --> 00:53:54,199
But let's look at the underworld here.

555
00:53:54,199 --> 00:54:04,280
The one thing, and this you just have to remember until you get to Dante, there's no renting of the bad people in the underworld.

556
00:54:04,279 --> 00:54:12,440
There's just a whole bunch in book six, starting on 805, bottom of 150 in my book.

557
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:19,319
There are people who hated their brothers, struck their fathers, deceived a client, were caught in adultery.

558
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:23,320
What a grab bag of bad things to do.

559
00:54:23,319 --> 00:54:31,640
Here's one later, line 826, who assailed the chamber of his daughter, that is, a child molester.

560
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,239
I mean, they're all down there.

561
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:36,839
And they are all sort of scrambled.

562
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:51,719
Well, Dante, because the medievals are devoted to getting everything sorted out and clear in hierarchies, has them separated into nine different categories, and the categories are worse and worse, and you understand why they're worse and worse.

563
00:54:51,719 --> 00:54:53,080
Nothing like that.

564
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:56,040
But now comes the really interesting comparison.

565
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:10,199
That is why they go to the underworld and what they learn about what it is to be a human being by seeing what it is to be a dead human being.

566
00:55:10,199 --> 00:55:19,040
The first thing is just very quick, to say, Odysseus goes to the underworld to find out his future, to find out about going home.

567
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:27,760
And he discovers that he's finite and he's going to die, and we better stop playing around and looking around and go home.

568
00:55:28,399 --> 00:55:38,800
And he goes to see his father and connect up with the tradition and to see, hear from his father the whole future.

569
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:46,319
And it's again, but mostly it's always the past.

570
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:50,320
It's from his father that he's going to learn this, and he's going to see his father.

571
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:54,320
Okay, but now comes the really interesting part.

572
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:57,199
And I wonder if you sort of noticed it.

573
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:03,760
If you read this, did you notice how they relate to their bodies once they're dead?

574
00:56:04,719 --> 00:56:06,880
Well, what happens?

575
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:25,600
There's a part of the underworld on round page, the bottom of page 151, line 845, which is not full of criminals of various sorts who are being tortured in various ways, but a very nice place to be.

576
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,680
It's the land of gladness, this is 846.

577
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,199
Glades of gentleness, groves of blessedness.

578
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:44,320
Now that comes from Homer, because that's where Menelaus is going to go, for instance, where everything was a dream of ease.

579
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:53,360
And it shows up in Dante as limbo, which is where the virtuous pagans go, and even according to Dante.

580
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:54,719
And what do they do?

581
00:56:54,719 --> 00:56:58,239
Well, this is where it gets sort of funny on 152.

582
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,440
They play around at being soldiers and heroes and so forth.

583
00:57:01,279 --> 00:57:07,560
About 860.

584
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:16,600
From far, Aeneas wondered if their phantom armor and chariots, their spears and so forth, their horses grazed in the grass.

585
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,799
These are all phantom.

586
00:57:17,799 --> 00:57:19,239
These are virtual.

587
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:28,840
The very same delight that once was theirs in life, in arms and chariots, and care to pasture their sleek steeds, has followed to this underneath.

588
00:57:28,839 --> 00:57:31,239
Does you recognize that?

589
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:40,920
A kind of virtual place where you can fight and have battles, but nobody really ever gets hurt and there's no risk.

590
00:57:41,719 --> 00:57:42,839
Anybody recognize that?

591
00:57:42,839 --> 00:57:43,879
You were recognized.

592
00:57:43,879 --> 00:57:44,999
It's the Holodeck.

593
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,239
It's the Holodeck from Star Trek.

594
00:57:47,239 --> 00:57:48,360
Exactly.

595
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:57,640
There is this sort of virtual world in which these soldiers go and which they get to go riding on, what do they call it?

596
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,760
Not virtual horses, but the same sort of thing.

597
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,880
Where are they?

598
00:58:03,879 --> 00:58:05,880
Pastoring their deeds.

599
00:58:06,199 --> 00:58:07,080
I've lost the word.

600
00:58:07,399 --> 00:58:09,479
Oh, phantom, phantom horse.

601
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,199
Somebody wanted to say something, something.

602
00:58:12,359 --> 00:58:12,839
What?

603
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,080
Playground?

604
00:58:15,399 --> 00:58:19,320
It's like kids, except that it's grown-ups.

605
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:23,559
They're playing like kids, because, and even, it's even safer.

606
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:27,400
I mean, kids sort of fall sometimes and get bloody noses or fight with each other.

607
00:58:27,399 --> 00:58:28,840
You can get.

608
00:58:29,399 --> 00:58:36,600
It's so weird because it says that they're doing the same thing that they delighted in when they were soldiers.

609
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:45,520
Well, not really, because what they delighted in, presumably, when they were soldiers, was being able to win and having something at stake.

610
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:52,079
But they, oh, that's another Star Trek connection.

611
00:58:52,399 --> 00:58:56,479
I think it's in Star Trek, the generation, or whatever it's called.

612
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:10,079
Remember, is that the one where Kirk is riding around on horseback, but he's really been put in this other world where it's all virtual, and the Picard has to go and get him.

613
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,000
Does that sound familiar to you?

614
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:19,839
And they try to, and he's just been riding this nice horse and jumping across a chasm, and they point out to him that it really wasn't at all risky.

615
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:26,399
There were no surprises, and he couldn't get hurt, and it wasn't at all like jumping around on a real horse with real chasms.

616
00:59:26,399 --> 00:59:32,960
And they convince him, and he leaves, I forget where he is, and comes back to the real world.

617
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:44,800
They are sort of living out the stoic dream of a world in which everything is under control, there are no surprises, and nobody can ever get hurt.

618
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:52,640
That's their idea of the good place to be, the perfect place to be.

619
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:56,000
So there's, let's see now.

620
00:59:56,319 --> 01:00:03,199
But of course, there is something rather boring about that.

621
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:11,840
And you'd think they would want to maybe go back to the real world, and they can because virtual believes in reincarnation.

622
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:16,239
So their souls could go back to the real world.

623
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:25,040
You'd think that might be more interesting, risky, full of surprises, meaningful successes, and meaningful failures.

624
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,239
And do they want to go back to the real world?

625
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:29,839
Remember?

626
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:31,120
Our world?

627
01:00:32,199 --> 01:00:34,120
They could get their bodies back.

628
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:37,560
Just think how Achilles would be happy to get his body back.

629
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,480
They don't want their bodies back.

630
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,480
They don't want to go to the real world.

631
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:45,879
On page one, on the next page, down here.

632
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:49,639
So in the middle of 154, line 950.

633
01:00:50,759 --> 01:01:03,239
He asks his father, that is, Aeneas asks Anchises, but father, can it be that any souls would ever leave their dwelling here to go beneath the sky of earth and once again take on their sluggish bodies?

634
01:01:03,239 --> 01:01:04,840
Are they madmen?

635
01:01:04,839 --> 01:01:05,880
What about that?

636
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,320
You see, he's reversed 100%.

637
01:01:09,319 --> 01:01:10,919
Achilles would give anything.

638
01:01:10,919 --> 01:01:18,680
He would be a farmhand, he says, living on hard rations if he could just have the power of his body back.

639
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:21,159
These people don't think of the body as powerful.

640
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:26,040
They think of it as sluggish, and they don't want their bodies back.

641
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:30,919
And it gets again clear at 970.

642
01:01:31,239 --> 01:01:42,120
Fiery energy in these seeds that is in them is some fiery energy, but it's ruined by their bodies.

643
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:45,640
The seeds are their sort of spark of life.

644
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:51,160
Their source is heavenly, but they are dulled by harmful bodies, blunted by their own earthly limbs.

645
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,600
They're mortal members.

646
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:55,880
Because of these, they fear and long and sorrow.

647
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:00,280
Because of these, they fear and long and sorrow and joy.

648
01:02:00,279 --> 01:02:02,440
They do not see the light of heaven.

649
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:05,239
Oh, that's hard for me even to read it.

650
01:02:05,239 --> 01:02:06,919
I'm so unsoiled.

651
01:02:07,239 --> 01:02:12,360
It's bad to fear and long and sorrow and joy.

652
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:16,960
That's what happens to them when they're on earth.

653
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:19,119
And then they don't get to see the light of heaven.

654
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:32,160
They are dungeoned in the darkness and blind prison of their bodies, among which joy happens to be one of the things that they experience, and they don't want to experience joy.

655
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:37,040
I suppose because if you experience joy, as a sort of Buddhist line, you get attached to it.

656
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:40,239
Once you get attached to it, you'll be miserable if you have to give it up.

657
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:42,080
It's a stoic idea, too.

658
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:46,880
And so, but if you then, how do they ever get back?

659
01:02:46,879 --> 01:03:01,760
How does anybody ever go back to be incarnated in a risky world where you can take, you can be surprised and you don't have everything under control?

660
01:03:01,759 --> 01:03:03,040
Well, what happens to them?

661
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,640
Do you remember that?

662
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:08,079
Well, they have to be brainwashed, literally.

663
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:12,960
They have to be put into the river Lefe, which makes them forget everything.

664
01:03:13,279 --> 01:03:23,040
And only when they've forgotten how really bad it was to have a body and be in this risky world, are they then ready to go back?

665
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:27,919
This is the middle of the next page, 980, 990.

666
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:50,160
After they've been there a certain time, they're summoned by the God to Leithe, that's the river of forgetfulness, in a great assembly, that free of memory, they may return beneath the curve of the upper world, that is, go back up to the earth, and they may once again begin to wish for bodies because they don't know what a drag it is to have a body.

667
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:56,480
And so, while they have forgotten everything, they are sent, they go back.

668
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,319
So much for that, three days.

669
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:09,880
So, but you can begin to see what a boring life this comes down to, where you don't even want joy.

670
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:14,760
And it's all just because you can get rid of all the risks that way.

671
01:04:15,879 --> 01:04:23,479
And that's a kind of transition to Christianity, which I don't want to go into and don't have time to go into right yet.

672
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:24,279
We'll get there.

673
01:04:24,279 --> 01:04:26,199
But consider this already.

674
01:04:26,839 --> 01:04:52,199
If the Roman Empire was made up of people who didn't want to have any surprises, take any risks, experience any joy, if that's what the top most sensitive, most influential people felt, you could understand why it might be just swept away by a new, exciting, ecstatic religion where the body is super important.

675
01:04:52,199 --> 01:04:55,319
After all, God gets a body and so forth.

676
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,480
But we'll see.

677
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:06,600
But there is this in it because you want to ask yourself later, how did this strange religion so quickly take over the Roman Empire?

678
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:22,680
And people thought of Virgil, Beatrice didn't mention this, but I'm sure she knows about this more than I do, as a kind of photo-Christian, that he expressed a kind of sadness about the world, namely, a world without a savior isn't worth living in.

679
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:29,080
They thought that he understood that, and that therefore he was setting up the pods of Christianity.

680
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:34,279
Now, one last thing we've got to have to talk about the underworld.

681
01:05:34,279 --> 01:05:37,159
Let me just make sure that I am where I'm supposed to be.

682
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:40,519
Yeah, well, we've got to see the Ga.

683
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:48,640
All of this, in a way, is to get to the bottom of 156, lines 10, 45.

684
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:53,760
There, we're going to be told about Augustus.

685
01:05:54,080 --> 01:06:00,559
And he, okay, so now turn your two eyes here to look upon your Romans, your own people.

686
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:08,560
Here is Caesar, and all the line of Julius, that's the Julius Caesar that you all know about.

687
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,239
And that will come.

688
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:16,320
I mean, these are all descendants of Aeneas beneath the mighty curve of heaven.

689
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:22,959
And this, this is the man you heard so often promised, Augustus Caesar.

690
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:40,079
You realize that this takes place, the whole Aeneid, written by Virgil at the time of Augustus, earlier, way earlier than Augustus, where Aeneas hasn't even founded Rome yet, so that all the things that have actually already happened can be predicted.

691
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:45,600
And they are being predicted by Aeneas' father.

692
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:49,840
There will be Julius Caesar, and after Julius Caesar, there'll be Augustus Caesar.

693
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:53,199
Augustus means, doesn't, it means what?

694
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:59,120
Something like venerable or I forget, what is Augustus?

695
01:06:59,759 --> 01:07:01,120
God-like in some way.

696
01:07:01,919 --> 01:07:02,639
I don't know.

697
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:05,680
Anybody knows they should come and tell me.

698
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:10,879
Augustus Caesar, son of a god, who will, and that's important.

699
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:17,360
So there's going to be a son of a god who's going to, so to speak, save the world.

700
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,440
That's what Virgil's writing.

701
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,560
That's what Aeneas' father is telling him.

702
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:30,560
Who will renew a golden age in Latvium, that's the Roman Empire, in fields where Saturn once was king, and so forth and so forth.

703
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:32,520
We don't need more of that.

704
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:35,799
And that may be all I need to tell you.

705
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:36,520
Let's see.

706
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:40,520
Oh, I see, I wrote down here: Augustus means venerated.

707
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:42,119
You think that's right?

708
01:07:42,119 --> 01:07:44,119
And that's what you do for a god.

709
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:56,199
So he's son of a god, and I'm just looking at, and he's going to hold up to the people like a work of art, the essence of Rome.

710
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,359
That's what I want to talk about now.

711
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,799
Remember, we read it already, so I don't have to read it again.

712
01:08:01,799 --> 01:08:05,400
It's line 130, where he's predicting that.

713
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,680
I'll just read the end of it.

714
01:08:06,999 --> 01:08:08,199
You don't do what the Greeks did.

715
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,480
You don't make great statues.

716
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:10,520
You don't do astronomy.

717
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,480
You do so-and-so.

718
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:15,319
Yours will be the rulership of nations, remember, Romans.

719
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:24,600
These will be your arts to teach the ways of peace to those who conquer, to spare defeated people, to tame the proud.

720
01:08:26,839 --> 01:08:35,719
That's what Augustus is supposedly focusing on articulating and holding up to the Romans by way of Virgil.

721
01:08:35,799 --> 01:08:38,439
Virgil's doing the job because he's the artist.

722
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:46,039
He's making Augustus, well, he's made Aeneas already at one end of the beginning, a model of what a Roman should be.

723
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:54,439
And he's made Augustus now at the supposed end, because the predictions can't go any further, since that's all the further time has gone.

724
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:58,999
He's made him the perfect Roman.

725
01:09:00,919 --> 01:09:11,239
And predicting all that glory for Rome would make you think that it was all right to be there.

726
01:09:12,839 --> 01:09:13,959
Oh, yeah, that's all.

727
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:24,959
I mean, and it looks like, well, after all, Virgil is telling you, even though it looks like this is a sort of boring time, it's really a marvelous time for the Romans.

728
01:09:24,959 --> 01:09:29,680
And then, this is the last thing I want to say, we talked about it already prematurely.

729
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:46,239
Then you get this very mysterious ending on 160, where Virgil seems to undercut the whole pageant, maybe, and say they go out, when they leave the underworld, they go through the gate of false dreams into the world above.

730
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:48,560
It's not clear.

731
01:09:48,879 --> 01:09:59,279
One, it's not clear to me whether anybody would want to live in the world of Augustus, the Stoic world.

732
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,799
They'd literally rather be dead.

733
01:10:02,799 --> 01:10:05,039
That's a pretty bad situation.

734
01:10:05,839 --> 01:10:15,759
But even if you think that there might be something to be proud of that's worth doing in the world of Augustus, Virgil may be having your doubts.

735
01:10:15,759 --> 01:10:19,999
Remember, that goes with what Theodor said, that he said, burn the manuscript.

736
01:10:19,999 --> 01:10:24,399
One possible reason is he doesn't want to write propaganda.

737
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,239
But let's not read it that way.

738
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:33,680
I just, I can't help it because I find it so crazy, this ideal, the Stoic ideal.

739
01:10:33,680 --> 01:11:01,560
But if, but let's suppose, I mean, when you read it, just look for the way this work focuses and understanding of being as control, as production, as taming the forces that get out of control, and see that that's another step toward monotheism because there's this one God, if there's any God at all.

740
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:05,399
I mean, there are these household gods, but they aren't what unifies the culture.

741
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:11,079
And if there's any gods at all, it's got to be Augustus who is the focus of all of this.

742
01:11:11,079 --> 01:11:17,959
Okay, it's like a you'll see, it's like a breath of fresh air after this to go on and read the Gospel of John next time.
