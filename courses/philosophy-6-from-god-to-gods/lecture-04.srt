1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,121
So let's just do the gods one more time.

2
00:00:03,761 --> 00:00:10,960
So starting at the bottom of the chart, we did Gods Last last time, didn't we?

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,961
Does anybody remember?

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,721
Okay, so starting at the bottom, I won't go, I'm going to go real fast.

5
00:00:16,721 --> 00:00:26,480
There are these forces that everybody is under and which are sort of very basic, the earth and the heavens and time.

6
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:32,080
And then that's not anything we can say anything interesting about, I think.

7
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:38,640
And it's not even anything that the people in the culture have anything interesting to say about.

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,680
It's just some very basic structure that shows up in all sorts of myths.

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:01:05,680
The second one is a cross-cultural kind of structure, too, but it's got its own, each culture makes its own interpretation of, for instance, nature, death, need for shelter, the seasons and the fact that you need to eat.

10
00:01:05,681 --> 00:01:21,600
All of that is in the gods of Poseidon for nature, Hades for death and the underworld, Hestia for the hearth and shelter, and Demeter for the seasons and the harvest.

11
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:56,520
Then one of the children of Kronos, which is the way basic time god, who never shows up and talks to people, by the way, these basic gods that we've just been talking about, Gaia, Uranus, that is earth and heaven, Cronus time, and the four I just mentioned who are children of Kronos, they are such impersonal kinds of cultural, or personal kind of forces, or general, such general cultural forces, that they aren't personified in people.

12
00:01:57,401 --> 00:02:17,080
There are people there, but they don't show up and talk to human beings and stand on human, next to human beings when they do things like Athena does when Telemachus does his coming from a child world to a man's world, or as Aphrodite does when Helen leaves the domestic world for the erotic world.

13
00:02:17,641 --> 00:02:27,480
These other basic general forces, even though they are represented by people, aren't interacting directly with people.

14
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,281
But then come the ones that we're really interested in.

15
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:36,281
And that is, Cronus gives birth to Zeus, and Zeus, I'll come back to this later.

16
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:40,121
If you ask yourself, well, what's Zeus' job?

17
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:46,040
His only job description really is protector of strangers, which is pretty weird.

18
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:52,760
And I won't tell you, I have a lot to say about that, but I'd rather get there by talking about all the other gods first.

19
00:02:52,761 --> 00:02:54,361
So let's go.

20
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:05,161
There are all these gods that represent something like three different things that I haven't distinguished very well, as somebody in office hours was convincing me of.

21
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:17,281
You could say that the gods like Aphrodite, who is the erotic love god, goddess, the sort of golden Aphrodite, there, Marilyn Monroe.

22
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:31,760
And when you could say that she represents the mood, that when she shines on you, anybody, they're in the mood for sex or love or something, and that is somewhere in that dimension.

23
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:41,121
And then, but that's, there are also people who are just generally in that mood and particularly sensitive to that mood.

24
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,401
And Helen is like that.

25
00:03:42,401 --> 00:04:09,201
I mean, she doesn't just happen to be in this mood when Paris goes by, presumably, but she's a kind of person who is very sensitive and open to the attraction of the opposite sex and of all the beautiful romantic, well, romantic is later, but beautiful ornaments and situations and shared experiences that go with that.

26
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,081
So there's the mood, the goddess shines, and anybody's in it.

27
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:17,680
There are people who have a tendency to be in that mood.

28
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:27,281
So that they're exactly, Athena is the only goddess who's with Odysseus, and she's always around, or almost always, accompanying Odyssey.

29
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:40,401
I presume Aries, the war god, is the only god that Achilles ever interacts with, except when Athena pulls him by the ponytail to stop him from killing Agamemnon at the beginning of the Iliad.

30
00:04:40,401 --> 00:04:49,360
And so then there are, so there are these people sort of associated with a particular god because they have a tendency to get in a particular mood.

31
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,961
And then there's something else which is, let me see how to put it.

32
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:59,321
Well, that's when I talk about worlds.

33
00:04:59,641 --> 00:05:10,600
I mean, there's the world of Aphrodite, which is all that goes into having a kind of life in which the erotic is the main thing.

34
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:17,800
And then there's another, and let me say more about that for a minute because I skipped it last time, and now I regret it.

35
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,161
There are certain general characteristics of worlds.

36
00:05:21,961 --> 00:05:28,760
So when you're thinking of the goddess like Aphrodite, you're thinking of a certain mood.

37
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:33,000
You're thinking of a certain kind of person that's in that mood a lot of the time.

38
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,040
And you're thinking about, or she represents, a certain world.

39
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,161
And what is a world?

40
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:45,321
Well, first let's just look at the things that we call worlds, and then we'll try to see what their common features are.

41
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:50,361
There's the business world and the what else?

42
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,161
The theater world, the academic world, and so forth.

43
00:05:55,161 --> 00:05:58,921
And then there are these bigger things like the ancient world and the modern world.

44
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:04,761
But the kind level we want to talk on is where there's a plurality of worlds, and you use the term all the time.

45
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:10,521
You just don't ask yourself, well, what is it to be in the business world or the theater world or whatever?

46
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:13,800
It's not some spatial kind of end.

47
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,081
Being in the theater is ambiguous.

48
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:20,841
If you're just standing around in the theater, you're not in the theater world.

49
00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:27,161
Being in the theater means, if it's a world story, being involved in theater things.

50
00:06:27,161 --> 00:06:32,201
And if you're in the business world, then your main energy and so forth is involved in business.

51
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:38,961
And if you're in the academic world, then, like us, then your main energy is focused in the academic world.

52
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:42,560
But what do these worlds have in common that we talk about all the time?

53
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,841
Well, there's at least two features that Heidegger finds in them.

54
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:52,880
There's always equipment for doing whatever it is that you do in that world.

55
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:59,360
So you can have props and costumes and theaters and so forth.

56
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,480
And you can have whatever business needs, computers and cubicles and CDOs and so forth.

57
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,721
And you certainly know what kind of equipment you've got.

58
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,240
I see it all over the place.

59
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,281
Computers.

60
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:15,281
I would have thought digital recorders.

61
00:07:15,281 --> 00:07:18,081
That just shows how surprising things can be.

62
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:21,360
But there's plenty of other things, books and pens and pencils.

63
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,760
And that's always in a world that it has its own kind of equipment.

64
00:07:26,081 --> 00:07:27,761
Take the Aphrodite world.

65
00:07:27,761 --> 00:07:35,201
Apparently, she has the beautiful dresses and Helen too, her long-robed Helen that we hear about.

66
00:07:35,201 --> 00:07:43,441
And there's, I don't know, what sort of the gifts that you give people when you're in that world and so forth.

67
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:48,401
I mean, they don't have Valentine's, but I'm sure they have some equivalent thereof.

68
00:07:49,841 --> 00:07:52,401
And in each of these worlds, then there's equipment.

69
00:07:52,401 --> 00:08:08,961
Of course, the Aries world of war and aggression and belligerence has got its swords and spears and helmets and horses and chariots and generals and foot soldiers and so forth.

70
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:23,801
So, okay, so now you can, so that I'm going to now distinguish three levels or three, I don't know, aspects, let's call it, of what it is that a god like Aphrodite, say, is in charge of.

71
00:08:24,121 --> 00:08:36,601
A mood, the life of a person who has a tendency to be in that mood most of the time, and the world that goes with being in that mood.

72
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:41,800
Meaning, oh, I forgot I knew there was another, besides equipment, put this back in the world, roles.

73
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,281
There's all, I named them, but I didn't call them roles.

74
00:08:44,281 --> 00:08:46,281
There are generals and foot soldiers, I said.

75
00:08:46,281 --> 00:08:50,281
And I said they're CEOs and the people in the cubicles and so forth.

76
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:55,321
And here, there are professors and teaching assistants and students and deans and so forth.

77
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,121
It's part of a world that there are these various jobs.

78
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:00,680
Okay.

79
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,440
Anybody want to say anything about that?

80
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,840
I think I owe you that a lot from way back when I hadn't distinguished those.

81
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,641
Okay, well, now that I have, yeah, yes, of course.

82
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:12,121
Good.

83
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:12,921
Good point.

84
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,200
That's very important.

85
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,841
Right.

86
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:20,601
A world is a kind of, in Heidegger jargon, it doesn't have much disclosive space.

87
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:30,921
It is an opening in which things can show up for you and offer you possibilities for action.

88
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:38,680
In fact, that's true enlightenment, as if it was up to you to make a choice, draw you into certain possibilities of action.

89
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,680
When the war world shows up, they all march off to war full of energy and aggression and so forth.

90
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,401
When Aphrodite shows up, they all rush off to bed, full of energy too.

91
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:57,161
And in every one of the worlds, it opens up a lot of possibilities and draws you in.

92
00:09:57,161 --> 00:10:00,440
And each world has its own bunch of possibilities.

93
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:07,161
I mean, you don't find mixing of Aries in Aphrodite, at least not in their culture or our culture.

94
00:10:07,521 --> 00:10:15,040
There could be a culture where aggression and sex were very much tied up, and they had different gods and so forth.

95
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,201
But they certainly don't seem to be interrelated in this story.

96
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,440
I think I mentioned this: what does get interrelated between, well, it's interesting.

97
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:37,281
There's this crazy thing in the middle of the book, which I always sort of think of as a kind of sitcom, where Aphrodite goes to bed with Aries while Hephaestus is away.

98
00:10:37,281 --> 00:10:49,521
That's sort of interesting in this, in what we're talking about, in terms of what possibilities show up to what it makes sense to do.

99
00:10:49,521 --> 00:10:51,681
I didn't put it that way, but that's another phrase.

100
00:10:52,161 --> 00:10:55,361
What it makes sense to do depends on what world you're in.

101
00:10:55,361 --> 00:10:58,881
But in that crazy story, there are two things that are interesting.

102
00:10:58,881 --> 00:11:20,721
One, why is Aphrodite with Hephaestus, who is sort of portrayed usually as he's a cripple, and he's sort of ugly, and he's just a brilliant craftsman who makes very beautiful things, but it's a funny couple, golden Aphrodite and ugly Hephaestus.

103
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:30,401
Well, the answer seems to be, at least as far as I can tell, there is an overlap between the worlds, which I was talking about without naming.

104
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:43,121
The erotic world is tied up with beautiful things, beautiful earrings, beautiful clothes, beautiful gifts, and people who are at least trying to look their most beautiful and so forth.

105
00:11:43,121 --> 00:11:55,481
So there is something between the artifice of Hephaestus and the craftsman and Aphrodite.

106
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:58,040
And so they are there together.

107
00:11:58,281 --> 00:12:00,200
But they're not a terribly happy couple.

108
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,241
And as soon as Hephaestes goes away, Aphrodite goes to bed with Aries.

109
00:12:05,241 --> 00:12:17,800
And that's not surprising either that you've chose Aries because he is the aggressive, sort of, I suppose, somewhat brutal side and sort of raving crazy.

110
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,721
He's described as crazy, Aphrodite.

111
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:28,921
He's sort of out of his mind in an aggressive way, and she's sort of the goddess of people out of their mind in a passionate, erotic way.

112
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,081
And so naturally they get together.

113
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,920
But as you know, if you've read, how many have read?

114
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,361
You got that far already, haven't you?

115
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:36,440
I don't want to give away the sitcom plot.

116
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:48,281
But so Hephaestus makes this net, and he catches them, and then naked in his bed, and then all the gods come around and watch and laugh.

117
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:55,001
And I say that just because I want to point out different relations you can have to that.

118
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,841
And it'll get me to the next people I want to talk about.

119
00:12:59,161 --> 00:13:01,401
So we've talked about Athena.

120
00:13:01,401 --> 00:13:03,401
We talked about Hephaestus.

121
00:13:03,401 --> 00:13:14,201
Let's talk about Apollo because his reaction to the sexting in the middle of the book is so typical of Apollo, I think.

122
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,440
Remember, he's the far-shooting lord of distance.

123
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,081
These are phrases that apply to him.

124
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,361
And his fields are prophecy, medicine, and music.

125
00:13:24,361 --> 00:13:28,921
All of that has in common detachment.

126
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:35,721
And he's going to turn into the god of sort of theory and rationality when you get to Aeschylus.

127
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:52,000
He's always wanting to get the arguments straight and show that the reason is on his side and that what he sees is some kind of universal truth because he's never got passionately involved.

128
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:54,481
That's why he's the god of distance.

129
00:13:55,281 --> 00:14:04,721
Well, when Aries and Aphrodite are in bed together there, and all the gods are laughing, there's only two gods that aren't laughing.

130
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,561
But one is Apollo, who is just, I think, too detached.

131
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:26,561
And he turns to the god next to him, and that's, we'll get back to him next time, Hermes, and says, would you be willing to be so humiliated to go to bed with golden Aphrodite?

132
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,201
And Hermes says, in effect, of course.

133
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,521
But Apollo, it would be totally wrong if it was the other way around.

134
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:42,321
If Hermes said to Apollo, as if he was the spectator, would you be willing to go to bed with Aphrodite under those conditions?

135
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,800
Well, Apollo would be appalled, I think.

136
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,881
Wouldn't think of it.

137
00:14:47,521 --> 00:14:58,401
So we'll see that Hermes is a kind of, well, among other things, a very important kind of swindler, operator, thief.

138
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:05,201
And so he's ready to take anything he can lay his hands on and appropriate it, so to speak.

139
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,001
And he regrets he's not the one.

140
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:10,881
But, okay, so now we've got done Apollo.

141
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:13,121
We won't do Athena yet.

142
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:24,200
And Aries, there's nothing more to say except that he's the ferocious, crazy, sort of out of control, lerserk, war god, and Hephaestus, the craftsperson.

143
00:15:24,521 --> 00:15:30,361
The other ones are people that Artemis doesn't make any big show in this.

144
00:15:30,361 --> 00:15:35,721
She's the hunter, the virgin, the with a bowbo and arrow.

145
00:15:36,121 --> 00:15:42,681
I don't know what life was like then, but I think she would now be the goddess of horse people.

146
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,241
My daughter, for instance, was definitely an Artemis horse person.

147
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:52,920
And now she still loves animals and is now an environmentalist.

148
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,161
I'm sure Artemis would be the goddess of the environmentalists at this point.

149
00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:00,040
The green goddess.

150
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,481
I don't know what she looks like.

151
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:09,401
And Persephone, she's sort of running things in Hades, but I don't know anything about her.

152
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:16,680
And I mentioned Dionysus in here too, but it's funny, he never gets mentioned, as far as I remember, at all by Homer.

153
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,800
Homer just doesn't care about Dionysus.

154
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,441
Yeah.

155
00:16:20,761 --> 00:16:23,321
Now we need our question person.

156
00:16:25,641 --> 00:16:27,881
We're going to test this and see if this theory works.

157
00:16:28,361 --> 00:16:32,920
I was just mentioning that Dionysus was a newer god after Homer's time.

158
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,440
He was sometimes believed to be an imported god from foreign countries.

159
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,401
So good.

160
00:16:39,401 --> 00:16:39,881
Thanks.

161
00:16:39,881 --> 00:16:40,920
Well, that works too.

162
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,401
Thank you.

163
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:42,760
Just keep the microphone.

164
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,321
Don't take it home with you, but hold on to it.

165
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:49,880
It helps.

166
00:16:49,881 --> 00:16:51,000
Do you hear me?

167
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,680
Okay, then I'll keep it.

168
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,641
There must be a better way, given all this high tech.

169
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,560
But for the day, I'll have to do.

170
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:01,001
Okay, so that's interesting.

171
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,561
Well, good.

172
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:05,401
I printed Dionysus in a funny font because I suspected something.

173
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,321
So he isn't even around yet at Homer's time.

174
00:17:08,321 --> 00:17:10,401
You know anything about Persephone?

175
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,680
No, nobody knows.

176
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,520
You know something about Persephone?

177
00:17:13,841 --> 00:17:14,881
I see.

178
00:17:14,881 --> 00:17:21,361
Okay, that's I can see why she doesn't interest Homer very much because those aren't really worlds.

179
00:17:21,361 --> 00:17:24,881
There's no sort of equipment, really, for being summer or winter.

180
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,841
If there is, there's certainly no roles for me.

181
00:17:27,841 --> 00:17:31,760
And it doesn't define a kind of life, a tendency to be summer or winter.

182
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,760
So it's not a, she's not a good person.

183
00:17:33,841 --> 00:17:40,480
See, all these other people, there are roles for doing their kind of thing and equipment for doing their kind of thing run through it.

184
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:47,361
Aries, the war person, the craftsperson, the theory person, the hunting kind of person.

185
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:50,881
She's sort of marginal and that's how she gets treated.

186
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:55,121
And the erotic person, those are really whirls.

187
00:17:55,121 --> 00:17:56,161
Okay, some question.

188
00:17:56,161 --> 00:17:57,201
I saw a hand over there.

189
00:17:58,401 --> 00:17:59,761
I swear I saw something.

190
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,200
I know I did.

191
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,561
Doesn't answer the question?

192
00:18:02,561 --> 00:18:04,881
Well, okay, whatever.

193
00:18:04,881 --> 00:18:06,161
So let's go on.

194
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:15,040
So let me, I'm going to now sort of run through what I've written here and see if it corresponds to roughly to what I said.

195
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,641
So far, yes.

196
00:18:16,641 --> 00:18:22,561
And then there are these very peculiar ones that for various reasons I don't know what to do with.

197
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:38,800
By the way, I should say, I can't make a story that fits everything in the Odyssey and in the Iliad, that gods do all kinds of weird things, particularly in the Iliad, where Apollo, for instance, makes the what, who somebody's horse talk to him and tell him not to go into the battle.

198
00:18:38,801 --> 00:18:42,960
That just doesn't fit in my picture of what gods are supposed to be doing.

199
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:52,680
But I'm trying to construct a kind of ideal polytheism because Homer's got the best polytheism, the most worked out, the most interesting around.

200
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,761
And we just have to sort of extrapolate it and clean it up.

201
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:06,280
And I mean, there are all kinds of elements in it that probably are really folk elements in it, and they aren't fully integrated in it.

202
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:14,040
And there are also stuff probably that was put into it because it was an oral tradition for a long time before it was written down.

203
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:19,800
And when it was written down, things probably were written into it that weren't there all the time.

204
00:19:19,801 --> 00:19:21,720
But in any case, we don't care about that.

205
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:27,560
I mean, that's a very interesting question, no doubt, for people reading the Iliad and the Odyssey in a classics course.

206
00:19:27,561 --> 00:19:37,401
We want to get sort of what the basic insight of this kind of polytheism is, what a life inside this kind of polytheism is.

207
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:41,720
So there are people, this was all to say, there are people, I don't know how to deal with them.

208
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:47,801
Hera, I think Hera would be great as the goddess of domesticity, which she seems to be.

209
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:53,960
Married to Zeus seems to be her main thing, and being jealous of his affairs seems to be her main jobs.

210
00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:02,361
But we don't really get a full picture in her of what a domestic god just would look like.

211
00:20:02,841 --> 00:20:11,721
She would plan the big banquets on Olympus, and she would take care of the family and so forth.

212
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,680
But that doesn't seem to be a job for anybody on Olympus, and so we don't care about Hera.

213
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:28,200
There's another person in there who Hebe, who I don't put on the chart, who serves drinks and is in general and sort of takes care of cocktail parties and stuff on Olympus.

214
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,161
But it just doesn't get worked out.

215
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,801
And Poseidon is a very special problem because he's not a world.

216
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,401
He's the god of the anti-world, so to speak.

217
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:41,841
Why isn't it a world?

218
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:43,600
Because he's the god of nature.

219
00:20:44,321 --> 00:20:49,040
And there aren't roles and there aren't equipment to be nature.

220
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:57,840
And he's the overpowering force of particularly the ocean, which is the most overpowering force the Greeks knew and still is.

221
00:20:58,161 --> 00:20:59,840
Did I mention my movie last time?

222
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:01,760
Did I talk about Poseidon last time?

223
00:21:02,401 --> 00:21:05,920
I've gotten dependent on my own podcast to remember what I've said.

224
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,401
So anyway, did I ask how many have seen Castaway?

225
00:21:10,401 --> 00:21:11,440
I probably didn't.

226
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,520
How many have seen Castaway?

227
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,321
Good, good.

228
00:21:14,321 --> 00:21:17,920
If I had time, I'd show it in the course just to show what the...

229
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:27,760
When I saw that movie, I felt for the first time, now I know what it was like to be Odyssey on a raft in the face of this overwhelming force of the ocean.

230
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,440
It's brilliant for that.

231
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,121
And so he is that.

232
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:34,800
And Odyssey suffers from him.

233
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:41,440
But he doesn't have the normal features of world-defining gods.

234
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:47,361
He really looks like he belongs down in that lower level where I put him.

235
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,401
And he's, and it's important.

236
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,680
Homer doesn't have this all figured out in his head, I don't think.

237
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:02,641
But the sense of the people, sort of certain stories obviously stick and certain ones don't.

238
00:22:02,641 --> 00:22:12,800
And like certain metaphors, like up a title or something, all the funny things that people say, that one takes off or laid back and so forth.

239
00:22:12,801 --> 00:22:19,761
So the the kind of wisdom of the people sort out all the stuff about gods and some of it comes around.

240
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:25,320
I agree, but Poseidon isn't one of those gods of possible Greek worlds on the chart.

241
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,720
He is the brother of Zeus.

242
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:33,240
He's one and he's he's not a father of all those human world gods.

243
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,200
He's and that's and they have to treat him.

244
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,761
He's on Olympus with the pantheon.

245
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:46,040
The pantheon is the name for all the gods that are on Olympus, and he's on Olympus, unlike Demeter and Hestia and Hades.

246
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:54,121
But he's certainly in an ambiguous position because he's the brother of Zeus and he doesn't have to do what Zeus says.

247
00:22:54,121 --> 00:22:58,840
And every once in a while, when he gets upset at people, he goes around and beats them up.

248
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:13,320
Because the Cyclops is a child of his, he gets very annoyed at Odysseus, who then that's where you get all this heavy beating up from the water when he comes crashing down on him.

249
00:23:13,321 --> 00:23:22,121
And the other gods can't do anything about it because it's as if it was the force of nature against all the other forces with your culture.

250
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:29,320
All the other forces are roles and worlds that you can only have in a culture.

251
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:35,321
And then there is Poseidon, who's outside of the culture, and the Cyclops, who's pretty much outside of the culture, too.

252
00:23:35,321 --> 00:23:39,641
We'll come back to the Cyclops later in another connection.

253
00:23:39,641 --> 00:23:43,081
So, so much for the God story, I believe.

254
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:44,841
Yeah.

255
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,361
I just wrote down here, but I've sort of said it.

256
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:53,881
Cyclops is a sort of a minimal fourth generation God.

257
00:23:55,081 --> 00:23:55,800
Not even a god.

258
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:56,280
Never mind.

259
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,881
He's, why do I have him on my chart?

260
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,841
I think we should cross out the Cyclops.

261
00:24:01,321 --> 00:24:04,760
You know, because all these others are gods, but is he a god?

262
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,041
Demigod or something.

263
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:08,320
That's another thing, by the way, I don't hear.

264
00:24:08,641 --> 00:24:16,321
I don't know how to cope with, but if anybody does, they should think about it, tell me about it, write a paper about it.

265
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:18,800
The demigods, are they very peculiar?

266
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,960
Probably Poseidon too.

267
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,240
They're half, I mean, they don't immortal.

268
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,320
They're not part of the pantheon.

269
00:24:26,321 --> 00:24:41,040
That's why I don't like Cyclops up there, because he's something, I don't know where to put him, but down lower, because everybody up at the top is in the pantheon, is a cultural archetype or whatever the right word is, paradigm.

270
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:42,800
I don't like archetypes.

271
00:24:42,801 --> 00:24:48,960
The reason I don't, archetypes are thought of as definitely cross-cultural things.

272
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,801
Cross-cultural heroes.

273
00:24:51,121 --> 00:24:54,641
And I think that's just a very bad way of thinking about it.

274
00:24:54,641 --> 00:24:57,361
It levels all the important differences.

275
00:24:57,361 --> 00:24:58,641
What heroes are.

276
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,520
So I want to say paradigms.

277
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,320
Gods aren't cross-cultural.

278
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,600
About all human beings that they can discover.

279
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:08,481
Some of them.

280
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,320
Anyway, so the story goes.

281
00:25:10,321 --> 00:25:15,920
But I want to say the important thing is that each culture's got a different shape on it.

282
00:25:16,561 --> 00:25:18,480
A lot of them don't even have heroes.

283
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:21,200
And some of them have very different kinds of heroes.

284
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,001
What the gods are aren't cross-cultural.

285
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,760
That's the third generation.

286
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:34,560
You know, there is the Gaia generation, and then there is the Hades and company generation.

287
00:25:34,561 --> 00:25:40,320
And then there is the second what do what what do I call it?

288
00:25:40,321 --> 00:25:41,521
The second or third generation?

289
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,241
The generation, anyway, with Hades, Poseidon, and so forth.

290
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,240
Those are the cross-cultural ones.

291
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,161
The s c the cultural ones, each culture has its own paradigm.

292
00:25:50,601 --> 00:25:55,641
The uh Apollo is not the archetype of of of intelligence.

293
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,480
We're the only culture with theory.

294
00:25:57,801 --> 00:26:00,920
A Athena's not the only form.

295
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,760
Well, Athena's so special.

296
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,721
Only, only.

297
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:15,401
Let's say Artemis is a is a spe is not the same the paradigm with a certain above and not like any all any other culture, if you spell it out, I think.

298
00:26:15,401 --> 00:26:18,361
Okay, somebody in back, can you say something very loud?

299
00:26:18,361 --> 00:26:19,720
You can't hear me.

300
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,480
What am I going to do?

301
00:26:22,121 --> 00:26:23,480
What's that?

302
00:26:23,801 --> 00:26:24,680
Oh, okay.

303
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,321
But good.

304
00:26:25,321 --> 00:26:26,440
Thanks for telling me.

305
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,601
Because I sound very loud to me.

306
00:26:28,601 --> 00:26:31,240
I wonder why there must be speakers all around here.

307
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,760
Yeah, they're I guess they're very near me.

308
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,121
Okay, here we go.

309
00:26:36,121 --> 00:26:45,000
Again, another test I just see I've written here is whether the all the gods in the in the pantheon can be a way of life.

310
00:26:45,321 --> 00:26:59,161
You can have a theoretic a theory life, you can have a love life, you can have a worry about the environment and love horses life and so forth, but you can't you can't have a cyclops kind of life.

311
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:05,240
That's is that's just not a not a cultural possibility.

312
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,840
Cyclops is really a minimal amount of equipment to help in the stars.

313
00:27:10,841 --> 00:27:14,040
And he also, what else?

314
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:15,800
And he's really just a part of nature.

315
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,801
The Cyclops is really a volcano.

316
00:27:17,801 --> 00:27:21,641
I mean he kind of he's related to volcanoes.

317
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:25,480
That's why he has one eye and then that eye gets fiery and smoke volcano.

318
00:27:25,641 --> 00:27:31,480
When when he just yells, I'm I'm the one who blinded you Polyphemus.

319
00:27:31,480 --> 00:29:11,760
Then Polyphemus starts throwing big rocks that they're almost sink the boat well because that's a volcano erupting so there's he's really still in the in the Greek god world and really just a piece of nature but anyway that's that I don't want to get into that we should get into the next part so how are the various good lives related I mean given that those there are all these different possible lives which I was just naming and won't name again you could list the goddess and that list of lives okay talk louder we're gonna have to throw the microphone at you what are I think all the Cyclopses are probably Poseidon's children is that what you ask yeah I don't know I mean I don't know if it says anywhere you have any idea I suspect they are because they're still because I mean all the volcanoes are and I think they're still pretty closely related to volcanoes just as Poseidon is pretty you don't picture them much Poseidon sort of running around like a person although he does do that a little bit likes them best okay so let's go let I'm going to talk now about the interesting way and cyclopses can be brought right into this discussion so I'll jump to that probably what I wanted to do anyway okay there's I want to say that in in the one of the things about polytheism and is that there's appreciation of lots of different kinds and and this is the interesting find sort of incredible and sort of congenial well you'll see when I get there uh th th it does Homer does not want to rank the lives.

320
00:29:12,321 --> 00:29:14,401
Lives are better than those lives.

321
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:16,641
Like saints are better than sinners.

322
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,280
Immature people are less are m mature people are better than immature people.

323
00:29:21,601 --> 00:29:23,800
We've got lots of ranked people.

324
00:29:24,121 --> 00:29:25,401
That's what it is to be probably.

325
00:29:25,801 --> 00:29:26,840
You're having trouble hearing me?

326
00:29:21,841 --> 00:29:27,881
Okay.

327
00:29:29,881 --> 00:29:31,241
I don't know what to do about this.

328
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:39,241
Anyway, okay, just keep telling me, and someday I'll figure out how to deal with this.

329
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,401
Oh, one of the ways to growth over.

330
00:29:41,401 --> 00:29:45,481
I won't try to do it now, but I know that inside that cabinet is the volume control.

331
00:29:45,561 --> 00:29:46,920
Let's see what happens.

332
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,680
No, then I have to take this one off.

333
00:29:48,841 --> 00:29:49,881
I give up.

334
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,361
This one.

335
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:55,881
Okay, like that.

336
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:57,240
Is that better?

337
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:57,881
Okay.

338
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,240
It isn't worse anyway.

339
00:29:59,321 --> 00:30:00,920
I don't have that kind of microphone.

340
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,200
But I don't have that kind of phone.

341
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,721
I only have three microphones.

342
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,520
I don't want to.

343
00:30:06,601 --> 00:30:07,080
Yeah.

344
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:08,760
What?

345
00:30:09,081 --> 00:30:09,560
Hold it.

346
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,600
No, I can't.

347
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:12,600
That's too distracting.

348
00:30:12,601 --> 00:30:13,480
Okay, I'm going to go.

349
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,520
You convinced me.

350
00:30:14,841 --> 00:30:21,000
We're trailing this over here to see about whether we can use this microphone.

351
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,201
I'm looking for the key.

352
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,240
There's the key.

353
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,520
We don't even know whether this key opens this thing, but let's try.

354
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,520
Aha, that's a start.

355
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:33,960
Now, microphone one, microphone two, microphone.

356
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,960
One, two, they're all turned up full.

357
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,520
Great.

358
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,240
What else?

359
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,321
That settles that.

360
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,200
But I'm looking more.

361
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,361
The wireless we can turn up, maybe?

362
00:30:44,361 --> 00:30:45,321
No, it's full.

363
00:30:45,321 --> 00:30:46,520
It's full.

364
00:30:46,841 --> 00:30:48,920
Well, there it goes.

365
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,520
I'm glad I tried.

366
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,840
And look at that.

367
00:30:53,161 --> 00:30:55,240
That's switched to off.

368
00:30:56,601 --> 00:30:59,240
I bet that's what happened last time, too.

369
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:09,920
After the first 20 minutes, if it's there's no way to lock it on, is there any way to put it on hold?

370
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,240
Everything has a hold button.

371
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,440
Everything but this one.

372
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,080
Well, I'll put it back in my pocket.

373
00:31:16,081 --> 00:31:17,440
There'd be some new disaster.

374
00:31:18,161 --> 00:31:29,040
Okay, so I want to start by contrasting, to show you how radically Homer does not want to rank wives.

375
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:34,000
I'm going to talk about the relation of the Phaeacians to the Cyclopses.

376
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,161
We just talked about the.

377
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:39,280
Am I ready?

378
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,841
Well, no, I'm not ready to talk about that.

379
00:31:41,841 --> 00:31:54,881
No, I want to start with the life of Achilles as the Aries warrior one, contrasted with Menelaus, who went off to fight, after all.

380
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,440
Paris took his wife.

381
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,760
But he's not mainly a warrior.

382
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:07,200
He's very good at being a host at banquets is where Telemachus finds him.

383
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:14,720
And I don't remember him doing anything very memorable in the Trojan War, in the Iliad either.

384
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:18,001
His life is kind of la dolce vita.

385
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,960
He's ease, no risks.

386
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,961
He's nearly immortal.

387
00:32:24,161 --> 00:32:26,881
Because he doesn't want to make himself vulnerable.

388
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:38,720
And the interesting question is, what will happen to him in sort of the final kind of judgment whether this is a good life or not?

389
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,081
And it turns out, well, it's a great life.

390
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,641
And Homer approves of it.

391
00:32:44,641 --> 00:32:53,561
And he's told when he captures the old man of the sea and gets him to tell him what's going on about things on page 69.

392
00:32:55,801 --> 00:33:06,840
You get an idea of what's the kind of life he leads and the relation this has to what happens to you after you die.

393
00:33:06,841 --> 00:33:14,600
So here he's about two-thirds of the way down on 69, about 600 in the margin.

394
00:33:14,601 --> 00:33:18,840
As to your destiny, Prince Menelaus, you shall not die.

395
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,081
Sorry, you shall not, he does die.

396
00:33:21,081 --> 00:33:23,961
You shall not die in the bluegrassland of Argos.

397
00:33:24,121 --> 00:33:33,880
Rather, the gods intend you for Elysium with golden rhadamanthus at the world's end, where all existence is a dream of ease.

398
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,561
That's the crucial phrase.

399
00:33:35,561 --> 00:33:47,401
Snowfall is never known, neither the frost of winter nor torrential rain, but only mild and lolling air from ocean bearing refreshment for the souls of men, the west wind always blowing.

400
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,801
The gods hold you as Helen's lord, a son of Zeus.

401
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:56,680
The important thing is that his life is a dream of ease.

402
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,200
That's where you see him at the banquets.

403
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:06,841
And when he dies, he'll go to Hades, and it'll just be a continuation of that.

404
00:34:07,161 --> 00:34:15,961
Now, the question I'm asking is: how does Homer rank that life relative to Achilles' life?

405
00:34:15,961 --> 00:34:34,600
Now, you haven't read the Iliad, but you all know that Achilles is the glorious fighter, and you don't maybe know that it's important that his mother, who was a goddess, a demigod, which is probably important, but I don't understand how, so I won't try to explain it.

406
00:34:34,601 --> 00:34:45,441
Anyway, the important thing about Achilles is that he's given the choice between a short and glorious life and a long, comfortable life like Menelaus.

407
00:34:45,441 --> 00:34:50,720
And he chooses a short and glorious life, a different way of life.

408
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:56,241
He wants to do great deeds and have people sing of him at wonderful banquets.

409
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:07,200
That's what, and be by far the fastest runner and the most enduring fighter on the field at Troy.

410
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:19,521
And what happens, and it looks like you want to say, well, the whole Iliad's about him, and Menelaus only has a bit part in the Iliad, and not even a very big part in the Odyssey.

411
00:35:19,521 --> 00:35:34,321
It must be that Homer and the Greeks that he represents choose the short and glorious life, which when you get sung about as a hero, over the laid-back life of somebody like Menelaus.

412
00:35:35,921 --> 00:35:45,361
But Homeric polytheism does a very strange move on Achilles, which I think is just fascinating.

413
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:50,161
That is, when, how is he going to deal with that?

414
00:35:50,161 --> 00:35:54,801
Is he going to show you Achilles being a better life?

415
00:35:55,121 --> 00:35:57,680
Remember what happens when they go to Hades?

416
00:35:58,641 --> 00:36:10,081
They go, and Odysseus sees Achilles, and they have an interesting conversation.

417
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,600
Where are we now?

418
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:12,800
On 200.

419
00:36:13,121 --> 00:36:17,200
So, 200, here we are.

420
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:26,200
On about very near the bottom, when he sees the spirit of Achilles in the middle of the page, he sees the spirit of Achilles at the middle of the page.

421
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:32,601
Then, in the next chunk, Odysseus makes a speech to Achilles.

422
00:36:32,601 --> 00:36:38,761
Son of Laertes, that's his father, Achilles' father, and the gods of old.

423
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,401
That must be because his mother is a demigod.

424
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,561
Odysseus, what?

425
00:36:43,561 --> 00:36:44,360
Who's talking?

426
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,561
Sorry about this.

427
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,040
Wait a minute.

428
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:49,321
Sorry, sorry.

429
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,121
It's Achilles talking.

430
00:36:52,121 --> 00:36:53,481
Just a second.

431
00:36:53,481 --> 00:36:55,641
Yes, I'm completely confused.

432
00:36:55,641 --> 00:36:57,320
Son of Laertes, I should have known better.

433
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,121
Laertes is Odysseus' father.

434
00:37:00,121 --> 00:37:01,800
And I don't know the gods of old.

435
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,841
I have no idea what he's doing in there, or they're doing in there.

436
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:11,321
But so when Achilles sees Odysseus, he calls out to him.

437
00:37:11,641 --> 00:37:12,680
You see where we are now.

438
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:18,840
Son of Laertes and the gods of old, Odysseus, master mariner and soldier, old knife, what next?

439
00:37:19,161 --> 00:37:23,480
What greater feat remains for you to put your mind on after this?

440
00:37:23,481 --> 00:37:30,441
How did you find your way down to the dark where these dim-witted dead are camped forever?

441
00:37:31,081 --> 00:37:33,641
The after images of used up men.

442
00:37:33,641 --> 00:37:36,521
Now that's the first question we have to deal with.

443
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:40,840
It turns out, remember what we have read, what the old man of the sea described.

444
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,760
Now I've lost the old man of the sea.

445
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,801
Where are we?

446
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,641
69.

447
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:46,521
Okay.

448
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,601
What is Hades like?

449
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:50,200
You get very confused.

450
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,360
Here, Hades is a dream of ease.

451
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,960
Everybody would love to go there.

452
00:37:53,961 --> 00:37:56,360
It's sort of the, it's like going to Hawaii.

453
00:37:56,601 --> 00:37:58,441
The weather's always terrific.

454
00:37:58,441 --> 00:38:08,880
And then you hear here that it's a terrible place where the dim-witted dead and the images of used-up men.

455
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,961
What's going on there?

456
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:25,200
Well, I guess, my story would be, Homer thinks that the afterlife is the perpetuation of what you had in this life.

457
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,921
In that sense, Menelaus's life stays the same.

458
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:40,241
But it can't perpetuate any kind of life where there is power and risk because they're all dead already.

459
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:51,281
So, what I'm trying to say is, from the point of view of Menelaus, the afterlife is just fine, and when he's dead, he's going to be just as happy as he is now, or even happier, because he's even going to be more comfortable.

460
00:38:51,280 --> 00:39:03,601
But from Achilles' point of view, the afterlife is a disaster because you can't have the kind of energy risk-taking once you're already dead.

461
00:39:03,601 --> 00:39:08,881
That's why these people are dim-witted dead, used-up men.

462
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:33,521
Now, the question is: does this fact that Menelaus can go on and have a great life even after he's dead, show that it's a better kind of life to live comfortably like Menelaus than to have a life in which you lead a short and glorious, energetic, risky life, and know you're going to have to die young?

463
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:40,481
Well, it looks like there's a problem, and it comes to a head at the top of 201.

464
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:48,241
Odysseus answers Achilles, but was there ever a man more blessed by fortune than you, Achilles?

465
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,041
This looks like this is the best possible life, you see.

466
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:52,161
Can there ever be?

467
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,000
We ranked you with immortals in your lifetime.

468
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:56,841
We Argaves did.

469
00:39:57,641 --> 00:40:01,240
Here, your power is royal among the dead men's shades.

470
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:05,161
Think then, Achilles, you need not be so pained by death.

471
00:40:05,161 --> 00:40:08,200
Okay, so this must you must be okay, Achilles.

472
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,401
You led what looks like the best possible life.

473
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,961
So you must be happy with that.

474
00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:18,521
What difference does it make now that you aren't able to risk your life anymore?

475
00:40:18,521 --> 00:40:24,041
And the answer is, let me hear no smooth talk of death from you, Odysseus, light of counsels.

476
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:33,641
Better, I say, to break sod as a farmhand for some poor countryman on iron rations than lord it over the exhausted dead, the used-up men, remember?

477
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:35,641
These people with no energy.

478
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:44,761
Remember, they even have to drink somebody else's blood, a cow's blood, or I forget where they get the blood, to have enough energy even to have this conversation.

479
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,840
So, let's see.

480
00:40:48,121 --> 00:40:51,241
Okay, then he says, well, let's stop with that.

481
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:57,720
It looks like he says, my life is not a good life.

482
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:08,761
I've been deluded because there's nothing worse than death, and I've risked my life and shortened my life, and it would have been better to be living as long as possible.

483
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,241
And he's very unhappy about it.

484
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:24,840
So now it looks like Homer has taken what looked like the best possible life and shown that it's got these tremendous limitations that being alive is a very good thing.

485
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:30,841
And if you're going to be risking your life and dying young, that's not a very attractive life.

486
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:35,720
So you'll see, there's this, but now comes a really surprising thing.

487
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,641
Sometimes Homer is so surprising and subtle.

488
00:41:38,961 --> 00:41:40,241
What happens next?

489
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:46,320
He switches right from complaining, Achilles, to saying, Tell me what news of the prince, my son.

490
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,281
Did he come after me to make a name in battle?

491
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,761
Or could it be he did not?

492
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,440
Do you know if rank and honor still belong to Peleus in the town of the Myrmidons?

493
00:41:57,441 --> 00:42:01,920
That's his island, what he's king of.

494
00:42:01,921 --> 00:42:09,041
Or now maybe Hellas and Pythias burn him, seeing old age fetters him, and so forth.

495
00:42:10,001 --> 00:42:20,641
Okay, now, so now it looks like Achilles, even though he sees that his life, how do I put it here?

496
00:42:20,641 --> 00:42:21,840
I like what I said.

497
00:42:22,161 --> 00:42:23,441
Just a second.

498
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:32,641
If you make your life a ferocious warrior life, then of course you're going to get old and lose your physical strength and die, lose all your force altogether.

499
00:42:32,641 --> 00:42:39,441
Achilles regrets that he chose a short and glorious life, and that's amazing.

500
00:42:39,441 --> 00:42:41,521
And Odysseus is shocked.

501
00:42:41,521 --> 00:42:50,720
And it looks like Homer has gone so far as to go from overvaluating the life of Achilles to now under-evaluating the life of Achilles.

502
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,361
He doesn't seem to be able to get it right, or to get any middle view.

503
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:12,441
But even though he thinks that, even though it looks like, this is what I wrote down, the life of a superhero is really not the life of the best, not the best life, but an inferior, deluded life, that's what I'm trying to say.

504
00:43:12,161 --> 00:43:14,561
Then, then what's the reversal?

505
00:43:14,561 --> 00:43:24,840
Well, the reversal is he's he believes, however, that what he wants his son to be is just like him, a soldier doing great deeds in battle.

506
00:43:25,161 --> 00:43:31,561
And he's asking about that, and he hears that his son was great, that nobody could do better.

507
00:43:31,561 --> 00:43:41,081
This is the bottom of 202, than his son, Neopotolemus, who ran out of the Trojan horse bravely before it while everybody else was scared.

508
00:43:41,081 --> 00:43:53,481
And when we had pierced and sacked Prime's tall city at the bottom of 202, he loaded his plunder and embarked with no scar on him, not a spear grazed him, and so forth.

509
00:43:53,481 --> 00:43:57,720
Aries, in his mad fits, notice he's Aries, he's crazy, as I said.

510
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,961
Aries, in his mad fits, knows no favorites.

511
00:44:02,441 --> 00:44:05,001
And now comes the punchline.

512
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,761
Achilles has discovered that his son is like him.

513
00:44:09,081 --> 00:44:18,521
And he regrets it looked like being a soldier who's likely to die young, or at least get older and not be able to go running around waving his spear anymore.

514
00:44:18,521 --> 00:44:20,120
But that isn't what happened.

515
00:44:20,121 --> 00:44:32,200
What happens is, but I said no more, for off he had gone, for he had gone off striding the field of Aspodel, the ghost of our great runner Achilles, glorying in what I told him of his son.

516
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:44,441
So finally, the glory of the heroic life looks so good that Achilles is even able to, you know, now he's not going to say, my son is being deluded.

517
00:44:44,441 --> 00:44:51,240
It would be better if he were, what did he say, a farmhand, that he's going around risking his life as a soldier.

518
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,200
He doesn't say that at all.

519
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,640
He says, isn't that wonderful?

520
00:44:53,641 --> 00:44:56,040
What's the moral of all this flipping back and forth?

521
00:44:56,041 --> 00:45:00,041
Well, I think the moral of it is that Homer doesn't rank lives.

522
00:45:00,041 --> 00:45:04,360
You can't ask who's got a better life, Menelaus or Achilles.

523
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:12,481
To do that, he has to sort of cut down the life of Achilles first so that you don't think he's just a natural superhero who could be as good as that.

524
00:45:12,481 --> 00:45:20,640
Because there is this problem of dying, and Achilles is not, and the soldier is going to die young.

525
00:45:20,641 --> 00:45:27,760
See, so he's getting, what I want to say is, Homer sees the trade-offs, the pros and cons of all these lives.

526
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,921
Menelaus has a soft life.

527
00:45:29,921 --> 00:45:33,601
He has no glory, but he's not going to miss anything when he dies.

528
00:45:33,601 --> 00:45:36,321
Achilles has a soldier life.

529
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:43,761
All he cares about is glory and fighting and risking, and he's going to miss all that when he dies.

530
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,841
But which life do you choose?

531
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,560
Well, they're equal.

532
00:45:48,961 --> 00:45:50,481
That's the important thing.

533
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,040
But I've got a bigger surprise if you doubt that.

534
00:45:55,041 --> 00:45:58,880
I hope you do, that he thinks that all these lives are equal.

535
00:45:59,441 --> 00:46:03,841
There's a point where Homer goes sort of off the chart in equality.

536
00:46:04,001 --> 00:46:05,200
You'll see that in a minute.

537
00:46:05,921 --> 00:46:07,200
Where are we?

538
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,240
The different lives I wrote down here are incommensurate.

539
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,840
You can't compare them.

540
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,680
There's no common standard.

541
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,281
There's something good and something wrong with every life.

542
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:26,480
Another interesting place that happens is on 87, where Calypso tries to compare life with her.

543
00:46:26,481 --> 00:46:31,760
Remember, she's the perfect sort of erotic partner.

544
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:37,680
I don't know how to describe her, sort of acacia kind of person or something, because she's good at everything.

545
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:42,281
She sings, she's good at conversation, I'm sure she's a good cook.

546
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,360
She's very good at bed and everything, and everything.

547
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:50,720
And everything, and the whole thing is that Odyssey, how could anybody want to leave?

548
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:55,241
And Odysseus is sitting there crying because he wants to go home.

549
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:57,960
And the interesting thing is, he's been there a year with her.

550
00:46:52,001 --> 00:46:59,480
He wasn't in any hurry to go home.

551
00:46:59,641 --> 00:47:01,241
She was so attractive.

552
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:05,961
It was only when the men said, Look, we're supposed to be on our way home, Odysseus, don't you remember?

553
00:47:05,961 --> 00:47:14,200
That he got out of this mood of being totally seduced by her and started wishing he was at home with Penelope.

554
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,480
Moods do that.

555
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,481
They wear off.

556
00:47:17,481 --> 00:47:26,121
Remember Helen's mood of always being with Paris happily, and it wears off, and she regrets that she's not home with Menelaus.

557
00:47:27,961 --> 00:47:32,761
So he's now sitting there every day, crying, wishing he could go home.

558
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,001
And she's feeling bad about that.

559
00:47:35,001 --> 00:47:43,960
She says on 87, son of Laertes, versatile Odysseus, after these years with me, years.

560
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:44,760
I wonder how long.

561
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,041
I said a year.

562
00:47:48,441 --> 00:47:49,880
No, I'm talking about Calypso.

563
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,081
Did I say, Certain Steve?

564
00:47:51,081 --> 00:47:51,480
I did.

565
00:47:51,481 --> 00:47:53,720
And he's staying with Calypso here.

566
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,121
And he's, okay, how long with Calypso?

567
00:47:58,441 --> 00:48:00,121
Many years, apparently.

568
00:48:00,121 --> 00:48:09,081
Yeah, so there he is, so seduced by this super sexy, super intellectual and everything woman, he doesn't even think of leaving.

569
00:48:09,081 --> 00:48:11,720
He forgets home and everything for a while.

570
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,321
Then he got bored.

571
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,920
And that mood wore off, and homesick mood took over.

572
00:48:16,921 --> 00:48:19,321
So there he is, crying on 87.

573
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:25,641
But she says, After these years with me, you still desire your old home.

574
00:48:25,641 --> 00:48:27,561
Even so, I wish you well.

575
00:48:27,561 --> 00:48:39,520
If you could see all before you go, all the adversity you face at sea, you'd stay here and guard this house and be immortal, though you wanted her forever.

576
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,561
Who?

577
00:48:40,561 --> 00:48:41,200
What?

578
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:45,280
Stay here and guard this house and be immortal, though you wanted.

579
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,321
Is he talking about Penelope already?

580
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,560
Does anybody understand that line?

581
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:51,360
Something go on.

582
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,920
Okay, let's let me go on then.

583
00:48:53,921 --> 00:48:55,521
That bride for whom you pine.

584
00:48:55,521 --> 00:48:56,720
Yes, it is Penelope.

585
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,281
Okay.

586
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,921
Yes, he's missing Penelope.

587
00:49:00,161 --> 00:49:02,961
That bride for whom you pine each day.

588
00:49:02,961 --> 00:49:05,760
Can I be less desirable than she is?

589
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,121
Less interesting?

590
00:49:07,121 --> 00:49:08,321
Less beautiful?

591
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:12,161
Can mortals compare with goddesses in grace and form?

592
00:49:12,481 --> 00:49:17,360
And to this, the strategist Odysseus answered, notice this very smart answer.

593
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,161
My lady goddess, here is no cause for anger.

594
00:49:20,161 --> 00:49:28,161
My quiet Penelope, how well I know, would seem a shade before your majesty, death and old age being unknown to you while she must die.

595
00:49:28,161 --> 00:49:34,081
Yet it's true, each day I long for home, long for the sight of home, presumably long for her too.

596
00:49:34,081 --> 00:49:40,881
If any God has marked me out again for shipwreck, my tough heart can undergo it, and he's going to try to get home.

597
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:48,480
So what I want to say is, he won't compare Penelope to Calypso.

598
00:49:48,481 --> 00:49:55,600
They are each, for sort of immortal perfection, Calypso wins.

599
00:49:55,601 --> 00:50:03,041
But for being his wife with his home and his son, that's winning out.

600
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:08,401
And he doesn't say in effect that one is better than the other.

601
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,041
He just, in effect, when one mood was on, that dominated his life.

602
00:50:13,041 --> 00:50:16,801
And he was pulled into that, kept in that.

603
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,720
Now, this other mood has taken over.

604
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,241
He wants to get home.

605
00:50:20,641 --> 00:50:29,161
Okay, so what's one of the things, by the way, you should notice, everybody seems to think that Odysseus is always just interested in getting home.

606
00:50:29,481 --> 00:50:30,601
That's just wrong.

607
00:50:30,601 --> 00:50:36,200
And in case I don't get a chance to say it someplace else, you should notice that for years he's happy to stay with her.

608
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:44,601
And he doesn't even get out of the mood of staying with her until his men sort of revolt and say, well, we're not having such a good time, and we want to go home.

609
00:50:44,601 --> 00:50:49,880
And the point is, I think, not just that he is so happy to be with her.

610
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,841
That's not the conclusion that interests me.

611
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:56,520
One interests me is he doesn't try to compare her to Penelope.

612
00:50:56,521 --> 00:51:01,561
But the other thing is, he's interested in seeing all these other ways of life.

613
00:51:01,561 --> 00:51:17,801
He's more interested in going where no person has gone before and just observing everything from, even if it's very risky, like when they go to see Circe and when they go to see Polyphemus, that his men almost get wiped out.

614
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,761
He's always manages cleverly not to get wiped out.

615
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:31,241
But his more interesting to him than going home in the beginning, anyway, is seeing other things.

616
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:37,081
I can't prove it with this because he stays there for all those years instead of running around and seeing other things.

617
00:51:37,081 --> 00:51:41,560
But when he gets to Circe, I won't try to find the pages.

618
00:51:41,561 --> 00:51:43,240
His men say, oh, let's not go there.

619
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,440
We see the smoke over there.

620
00:51:44,441 --> 00:51:45,881
Somebody lives over there.

621
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,720
But we're on our way home.

622
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:50,280
And Odysseus says, oh, we've got to find out what it's like over there.

623
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,161
Who lives over there?

624
00:51:51,481 --> 00:51:52,921
What is this person doing?

625
00:51:52,921 --> 00:51:57,001
And then they almost all get killed, or turned into animals, to be exact.

626
00:51:57,001 --> 00:52:00,840
And then again, with the Cyclops, they say, oh, no, we've had it, you've done it again.

627
00:52:01,641 --> 00:52:03,240
We don't want to go see the Cyclops.

628
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,120
We want to go home.

629
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:07,040
And Odysseus says, no, we've got to see who lives in those caves.

630
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:14,241
His real dominating thing is to see and experience as many worlds as possible, I think.

631
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,921
And we'll get back to that too, but I may forget to say it, so I'll say it now.

632
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,200
I wonder what I say on 179.

633
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,601
I say there's something relevant to what I'm talking about.

634
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:26,881
So let's see what it is.

635
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,161
What is it?

636
00:52:29,441 --> 00:52:30,960
Ah, look at that.

637
00:52:30,961 --> 00:52:33,841
There seems to be a contradiction.

638
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:38,400
Because this is still with Calypso, isn't it?

639
00:52:38,481 --> 00:52:39,440
This is Cersei.

640
00:52:39,441 --> 00:52:40,240
I see now.

641
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,200
That's what you're saying.

642
00:52:41,521 --> 00:52:45,040
We should notice on 179, he stays with her a year.

643
00:52:45,041 --> 00:52:46,561
That's what you said, didn't you, Beatrice?

644
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,801
At the bottom of 179.

645
00:52:49,441 --> 00:52:54,000
So day by day, we lingered feasting on roasts and wine until a year grew fat.

646
00:52:54,001 --> 00:53:05,521
And when the passing months and wheeling seasons brought the long summery days, the pause of summer, my shipmates one day summoned me and said, Captain, shake off this trance and think of home.

647
00:53:05,521 --> 00:53:11,921
And so then he's launched again into some new adventure.

648
00:53:11,921 --> 00:53:15,680
But he's in no big hurry to get home.

649
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:24,641
Okay, now I want to do my punchline about Homer refusing to compare ways of life to the point of mind-bogglingness.

650
00:53:24,641 --> 00:53:34,561
You're going to see that the two most extremely different ways of life in the book get, we're in effect told they're equally okay.

651
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,001
They're good lives.

652
00:53:36,001 --> 00:53:37,121
So here we go.

653
00:53:37,121 --> 00:53:38,960
It starts with the Phaeacians.

654
00:53:38,961 --> 00:53:44,480
The Phaeacians are the most civilized of any of the people he meets.

655
00:53:44,481 --> 00:53:53,320
They're even more civilized than the people back in Argos, not Argos, Ithaca, and then the Mamenelaus banquets.

656
00:53:52,161 --> 00:53:54,840
They've got even better banquets.

657
00:53:55,081 --> 00:54:03,001
They've got the best meals, the most quality craft productions, the best harpers, the best sporting events.

658
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,961
They have the good life.

659
00:54:06,521 --> 00:54:07,240
They know it.

660
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,440
Everybody knows it.

661
00:54:08,441 --> 00:54:11,801
They are closest to the Olympian gods, they say.

662
00:54:13,081 --> 00:54:17,001
They are, let's read it about five lines down.

663
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:25,161
And now they, that is the Olympian gods, have shown themselves in glory only after great hecatomes.

664
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:35,720
Those figures banqueting at our side, throned like ourselves, or some traveler met them when alone they bore no least disguise.

665
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:41,801
So anyway, so they are so well off that they dine with the gods.

666
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,521
And the next line is amazing.

667
00:54:44,521 --> 00:54:46,601
We are their kin.

668
00:54:46,601 --> 00:54:50,360
The cyclops rank no nearer gods than we.

669
00:54:50,680 --> 00:55:06,920
So he's refusing to even rank this absolutely civilized society of the Phaeacians as more or less near to God than the absolutely bruty cyclopses.

670
00:55:06,921 --> 00:55:08,520
I mean, I can't defend it.

671
00:55:08,521 --> 00:55:21,481
I think it's absolutely crazy, but I think it's something that the idea behind it is don't rank lives, don't rank cultures, don't rank ways of being human.

672
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,400
And this is the extremist refusal to rank them.

673
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,360
You're looking worried.

674
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,200
It is worrisome, I admit.

675
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,800
I didn't write it.

676
00:55:29,961 --> 00:55:33,560
Not ranking the same as ranking them all of equal work.

677
00:55:34,441 --> 00:55:35,560
I'm ranking them all?

678
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:36,801
Yeah.

679
00:55:36,441 --> 00:55:39,680
Not the same as saying they're all of equal rank.

680
00:55:40,001 --> 00:55:46,320
Well, no, that wouldn't be enough to say they were of equal rank, just that they are all to be explored with curiosity.

681
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,720
That would be the Odyssey thing.

682
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,081
But I think the Homer thing, you could say something more.

683
00:55:52,081 --> 00:55:56,801
There seems to be a kind of implicit anyway, refusal to rank them.

684
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:02,881
I mean, the important thing isn't just that Homer looks with equal eye on all these lives.

685
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,161
There is no place where he tells you that one life is better than another.

686
00:56:08,161 --> 00:56:10,961
But it's a kind of negative argument.

687
00:56:10,961 --> 00:56:14,481
But I mean, I think it's important.

688
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,280
I mean, I can say one thing, then Beatrice.

689
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:28,321
I mean, in the back of my mind, I'm thinking this kind of polytheistic openness to all ways of life is what makes this a comedy and not a tragedy.

690
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:40,081
As soon as you think that you've got to rank them, then you have to, then you get fights between the people who are for this kind of life over against that kind of life.

691
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,000
The Aeschylus is a tragedy.

692
00:56:42,001 --> 00:56:49,041
Aeschylus is a fight, the Orestea, about which is the better way of life.

693
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:52,561
And another thing, I guess it's in Homer somewhere.

694
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:58,641
Somebody tell me, where is the story about the golden apples that's behind the Trojan War?

695
00:57:00,161 --> 00:57:03,680
Was it Juno, that is, Hera?

696
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,440
Who has to give the apple to the sort of prize winner?

697
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,280
Hera?

698
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,041
Paris?

699
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:21,920
Paris has to give it to, and he has to choose between Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena, the three ladies.

700
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:27,881
Who gets the Oscar or whatever he's got among these three stars?

701
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:32,280
And the answer is: never ask a question like that.

702
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,281
That's going to lead to disaster.

703
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:37,001
That leads indirectly to the Trojan War.

704
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,320
He should have refused to rank them.

705
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:45,720
The way this is smart, Odysseus refuses to rank Penelope and Calypso.

706
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:46,360
But he does.

707
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,081
Who's he now?

708
00:57:47,081 --> 00:57:48,200
Who has to make the choice?

709
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,000
Paris.

710
00:57:49,001 --> 00:57:51,720
And Paris gives it to Aphrodite, right?

711
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:55,320
And she gives him the power to run off with Helen, and there you go.

712
00:57:56,441 --> 00:58:10,921
So there's something very interesting and attractive about Homer's implicit, and I take it that Greek Homeric culture's implicit suspicion of ranking anything.

713
00:58:11,481 --> 00:58:17,561
And that's going to turn out to be important and interesting, I think, already.

714
00:58:17,561 --> 00:58:18,041
Yeah.

715
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:21,961
Although I see, yes, let me find it.

716
00:58:22,601 --> 00:58:24,680
Because it would be good to look at the Greek, right?

717
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:30,761
It is so mind-boggling that one wonders whether it really says what I think it seems to say.

718
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,281
Well, let me find it.

719
00:58:32,601 --> 00:58:36,280
117, line 220, according to this.

720
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:39,561
Cyclops ranked no nearer gods than we.

721
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:46,521
Who would have thought that there were in the in the, who would have even tried to find out who was nearer God?

722
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:51,961
Neither one of them are like our gods, neither the Cyclops nor the Phaeacians.

723
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:56,600
And I think Homer wants us to see that neither one of them are nearer gods.

724
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:59,801
But that's, I think, amazing and weird.

725
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,280
Okay, let us go on.

726
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:08,241
I want to get up to why I like this kind of polytheism so much.

727
00:59:07,081 --> 00:59:08,960
Let's see.

728
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:15,281
I go into a whole thing about the Cyclopses here, but why do I have to do that?

729
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,481
Let's see.

730
00:59:16,481 --> 00:59:19,041
So I just say they're barely human.

731
00:59:19,041 --> 00:59:20,241
They're savages.

732
00:59:20,961 --> 00:59:22,720
They're brute natural forces.

733
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,401
They're like volcanoes.

734
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,401
I don't know why I'm telling you all this, particularly since I've told you once already.

735
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,040
But at least I can find where we are.

736
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:34,641
On 148, there's the Cyclops.

737
00:59:35,121 --> 00:59:43,441
They see the Lotus Eater, another life of ease at the top of 148, but they go on.

738
00:59:43,441 --> 00:59:46,481
And then they find the Cyclopses.

739
00:59:46,481 --> 00:59:49,601
And they neither plow nor sow.

740
00:59:49,601 --> 00:59:51,601
They're their hunter-gatherers types.

741
00:59:51,601 --> 00:59:59,840
They are not even into the agriculture business, nor till the ground.

742
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:03,280
And wine grapes in clusters ripen in heaven is rain.

743
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,720
That is, they make wine, I think, but they do.

744
01:00:07,441 --> 01:00:09,680
He has wine, but they don't cultivate wine.

745
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:14,001
They just go out and pick the grapes when they get ripe.

746
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,961
And they have no muster and no meetings.

747
01:00:16,961 --> 01:00:19,921
That is no politics and no culture.

748
01:00:20,481 --> 01:00:24,241
Then they each dwell in his own mountain cave and so forth.

749
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:29,520
So that's their thing.

750
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:40,161
And they are, on 151, line 230, he's a towering brute, outward power, a wild man, ignorant of civility.

751
01:00:40,481 --> 01:00:48,720
And yet, and now, he says, let's go see them.

752
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,920
That's why I'm reading this.

753
01:00:49,921 --> 01:00:54,520
Because I want to tell you that he's always ready to take any risks to see some new form of life.

754
01:00:54,840 --> 01:01:01,561
And they all say, no, let's go out, let's go to sea again as soon as possible.

755
01:01:01,561 --> 01:01:03,641
And he says, yet I refused.

756
01:01:03,641 --> 01:01:07,720
I wished to see the caveman, what he had to offer.

757
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:15,321
And so they all, most of his crew ends up breakfast and lunch and dinner for the Cyclops.

758
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,840
And now where are we?

759
01:01:17,081 --> 01:01:19,561
But he wants to see all forms of life.

760
01:01:19,561 --> 01:01:30,521
Now, I'm ready to talk about why I like this multicultural way of this polytheistic non-ranking.

761
01:01:30,521 --> 01:01:34,761
I think that it's very close to us.

762
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:47,001
And first you have to see how close it is to us, and then you have to see how different it is from us in order to see why Homer's got something that we lack.

763
01:01:47,001 --> 01:01:52,761
And as if he were somehow the stage after us instead of the stage way before us.

764
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:55,401
Well, to begin with, he's close to us.

765
01:01:55,400 --> 01:02:03,401
He seems to think that you ought to be able to choose all the different forms of life.

766
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,001
They're all interesting.

767
01:02:05,001 --> 01:02:11,641
They're all worth coming, lingering with for a while, and then you can always go on to another.

768
01:02:11,641 --> 01:02:15,481
But then you are free, it looks like.

769
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:27,161
Remember, in the Enlightenment, it looks like Homer's sort of after the Enlightenment, because it looks like Odysseus is free, self-determined, as to whether he goes and sees these people.

770
01:02:27,161 --> 01:02:29,561
He freely chooses to see the Cyclops.

771
01:02:29,561 --> 01:02:34,921
He freely chooses to see Calypso and Circe and so forth.

772
01:02:35,481 --> 01:02:43,040
So he's really pro-choice, like we all are, in this sense that you have the choice.

773
01:02:43,521 --> 01:02:46,320
You are free to choose the kind of life that you want.

774
01:02:46,481 --> 01:02:48,161
That's liberal democracy.

775
01:02:48,161 --> 01:02:53,841
That's where we all got there, thanks to Kant and people after Kant.

776
01:02:53,840 --> 01:03:00,641
And you don't rank them, and you don't get stuck with any of them.

777
01:03:00,961 --> 01:03:03,521
You can go from mood to mood.

778
01:03:03,521 --> 01:03:08,161
You can go from one kind of life to another, from one God to another.

779
01:03:08,961 --> 01:03:12,001
Even Helen has two major moods.

780
01:03:12,001 --> 01:03:20,961
She has the runoff with Paris mood and then come back and live happily with her husband and kid and have nice banquets mood.

781
01:03:20,961 --> 01:03:23,041
And that sounds good.

782
01:03:23,041 --> 01:03:28,000
Yet what it looks like, the moral is get the most, have the most diversity.

783
01:03:28,001 --> 01:03:29,601
It's beginning to sound familiar, doesn't it?

784
01:03:29,601 --> 01:03:31,441
Have the most diversity.

785
01:03:31,441 --> 01:03:42,881
All these different cultures are all these different moods, all these different lives available, and freely choose among them and even switch among them.

786
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:46,800
And don't try to rank them, because then you'll get stuck.

787
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:53,280
You'll be told that saints are good and sinners are bad, that monks and nuns are better than lovers and so forth.

788
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:56,240
Dante's got them, I was reading sort of Dante ranking.

789
01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:01,360
Dante's got, even in paradise, the souls in paradise, you'll see, are ranked.

790
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:17,200
And so that you can, they go, so that they go from monks and nuns to lovers to theologians, to church warriors, to rulers, to contemplatives, to those who just stare at God.

791
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:21,041
And nothing about the pros and cons in Dante.

792
01:04:21,041 --> 01:04:21,521
You'll see.

793
01:04:21,521 --> 01:04:23,561
He knows which life is best.

794
01:04:21,921 --> 01:04:25,161
But we don't believe that.

795
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:34,601
We think that there are all sorts of possible good lives, and that we shouldn't be ranking them.

796
01:04:34,921 --> 01:04:39,641
And so what has he got that we haven't got?

797
01:04:39,641 --> 01:04:41,400
I just have time to talk about it.

798
01:04:42,041 --> 01:04:45,800
We like the idea that he wants to have respect for all ways of life.

799
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:51,801
That's the diversity side of him, the multicultural side of him.

800
01:04:53,081 --> 01:04:59,641
And we'll see more about that when we get to Zeus, Athena, and Hermes.

801
01:04:59,641 --> 01:05:04,920
They are the very multicultural side of Homer.

802
01:05:04,921 --> 01:05:06,680
But there's something he's got.

803
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,081
I just want to leave you with that thought.

804
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:12,601
There's something he's got that we don't have.

805
01:05:12,601 --> 01:05:16,601
And it comes from the fact that there are the gods.

806
01:05:16,601 --> 01:05:19,241
And the gods are the attuning ones.

807
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:21,720
And the attuning ones are moods.

808
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:32,200
Now, you need to contrast what I'm going to call our laid-back, ironic relativism from Homer's relativism.

809
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:35,720
In our kind of relativism, all these different lives are equal.

810
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,881
All these different cultures are equal.

811
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:41,881
You have the right to do your thing, and I'll have the right to do my thing.

812
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:45,640
We don't have to take any of them as better.

813
01:05:45,961 --> 01:05:52,200
We don't even have to take any of them as something that has any particular serious authority.

814
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:57,801
It's like being in a kind of smorgasbord of various uh cultural and personal possibilities.

815
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:04,520
That's then everybody then everybody should do their thing, and nobody should criticize anybody else doing their thing.

816
01:06:04,521 --> 01:06:07,440
And there's no reason to do this thing rather than that thing.

817
01:06:07,001 --> 01:06:10,000
You do, you know, whatever, as I said earlier.

818
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:14,960
And then and there's something missing in that.

819
01:06:14,961 --> 01:06:22,881
What's missing in that is a kind of seriousness, a kind of what gives uh a life serious meaning.

820
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:27,921
It's too sort of experimental and open.

821
01:06:27,921 --> 01:06:37,121
But you don't want to go to Dante where it's all settled and you know which life you should be leading, and you just better do it because that's what God, how God ranks things.

822
01:06:37,121 --> 01:06:39,200
But so what's the middle ground?

823
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:49,361
Well, in a culture in which moods are taken very seriously, there is something like being pulled into these various worlds.

824
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:50,401
We saw that.

825
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:55,441
Helen does has that, and Achilles has that.

826
01:06:55,441 --> 01:07:00,401
They're being pulled into these various worlds, and they are serious.

827
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:08,641
The interesting thing is when you're in the mood, you can't have a sort of laid-back, relativistic, well, whatever mood about it.

828
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:13,760
Helen can't laugh at her affair with Paris, Paris.

829
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:20,321
Nietzsche says that every culture has something about which you're not allowed to laugh.

830
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,000
That means something sacred.

831
01:07:22,001 --> 01:07:27,761
That means something that has authority, that your free will and choice can't mess with.

832
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:43,360
And if you had a culture in which moods were as important as they are in the Homeric story, you could be culturally, a cultural relativist, but not a kind of laid-back, ironic, whatever relativist.

833
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:48,081
Because when you were in a mood, you wouldn't think that that mood was what everybody should be in.

834
01:07:48,721 --> 01:07:51,121
That's Homer never would want you to think about.

835
01:07:51,121 --> 01:07:53,800
But that mood has authority over you.

836
01:07:53,801 --> 01:07:57,800
You can't freely choose it, and you can't get rid of it.

837
01:07:58,041 --> 01:08:00,280
When you're drawn into it, you're in it.

838
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:06,360
And it is unquestionably meaningful.

839
01:08:06,681 --> 01:08:16,121
And when you are, when it leaves you, like Helen gets tired of Paris, then it's just not meaningful anymore.

840
01:08:16,121 --> 01:08:23,240
But the whole point is, what Homer has is these worlds, which are tied up with the tuning ones and the moods.

841
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:29,720
And he has a kind of seriousness and authority that we don't have.

842
01:08:29,721 --> 01:08:39,400
The Enlightenment has sort of wiped out for us anything but our free, arbitrary choice which we make and unmake by our own willpower.

843
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:59,720
The idea that there is a power outside of us which grabs us, gives our life meaning, tells us what's important and not important, casts its makes everything show up in its light, and as it's talking about like Dave did, what opens up a certain bunch of possibilities as the important ones.

844
01:08:59,721 --> 01:09:02,600
That's what Homer's got that we've lost.

845
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:12,121
That's what he's got that's better than total enlightenment relativism and total arbitrary choice.

846
01:09:12,121 --> 01:09:13,640
Okay, time is up.

847
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,800
But I hope this is recorded somewhere.
