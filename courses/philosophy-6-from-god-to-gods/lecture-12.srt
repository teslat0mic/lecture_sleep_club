1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
So we're ready to go back to the Taskylus.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:09,040
And all of you have, I hope, by now, reading it hard and carefully and becoming authorities on it.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,560
So here we go.

4
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:13,120
Remember where we were last time.

5
00:00:13,601 --> 00:00:30,520
I said, and there were three solutions that Athena gives to the problem that the culture is hopelessly split and self-destructive and will destroy anybody else who gets caught in it, like Orestes.

6
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:41,401
And we've had one of the three solutions: namely, she establishes a court system to decide whether Orestes is or is not guilty.

7
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:53,560
And the court, in this bizarre way, because it, well, just to remind you, because it's very important, the jurors are split 50-50, which just shows how the culture is split.

8
00:00:53,560 --> 00:01:18,120
And then Athena gives a completely crazy casting the deciding vote in favor of Apollo and the new gods and acquitting Orestes because she says, well, she doesn't have a mother and she's one of the new gods, so she's on the side of the man side of things, which doesn't seem very satisfying.

9
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,601
But it looks again like you get one of these reversals.

10
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:25,721
It looks like there's a happy ending, it seems, for a moment anyway.

11
00:01:25,721 --> 00:01:27,880
After all, Orestes wins.

12
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,480
He deserves to win.

13
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,800
He deserves to be acquitted.

14
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,320
He shouldn't feel guilty.

15
00:01:33,321 --> 00:01:37,080
And nobody should accuse him for having killed his mother.

16
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:39,641
So they seem to have accomplished something.

17
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:47,401
But, and that's obvious, it hasn't helped the split between the emotions and reason a bit.

18
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:50,200
Because the jury is just as split as ever.

19
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:55,560
And it's even worse than that, because it makes the Furies even madder than they were before.

20
00:01:55,561 --> 00:02:09,680
They were already upset for being, remember, repressed under the new gods and not given any place, and really literally repressed, pushed under the ground, and they are not at all happy with that.

21
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:24,000
And this sort of arbitrary sort of decision, based mostly on the fact that Athena knows where the thunderbolts are kept and has the power to enforce it, is not going to make them happy.

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:35,681
So, what they say on 163 at the top, the chorus speech, is, and it's just straight about repression: gods of the younger generation, you have ridden down.

23
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,961
I mean, that's the repression.

24
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,521
You have pushed under, you have put down the laws of the elder time, torn them out of my hands.

25
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:52,240
I disinherited, suffering, heavy with anger, let loose upon the land the vindictive poison dripping deadly out of the heart upon the ground.

26
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,320
Well, that's pretty bad.

27
00:02:54,961 --> 00:03:06,881
Certainly, it turns out that the court system made things worse instead of better, the way it operated in this hopelessly messed up culture.

28
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:16,560
They go on in the middle of the page: I am mocked by these people, I have borne what cannot be borne, great sorrow and dishonor upon the sad daughters of the night.

29
00:03:16,561 --> 00:03:28,480
And so now we're ready, then Athena has to come up with a second solution, which is a lot more interesting and important to the people of Athens.

30
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:41,920
So she promises, she understands that the Furies' real problem is that they're dishonored, they're not respected, they have no acceptable place, they are denied their role.

31
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,201
She understands all that, and she s and gives them a new job at the bottom of 163.

32
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:57,880
This is Athena talking: in complete honesty, I promise you a place of your own, deep under the ground that is yours by right, where you shall sit on shining chairs.

33
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,961
They're not going to be in the gloom anymore.

34
00:03:59,961 --> 00:04:10,440
Beside the hearth, which is the light that they're going to have, they're going to have the kind of light that you get from the fireplace, to accept devotions offered by your citizens.

35
00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:12,040
Well, that's good.

36
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:19,800
But what happens after that is sort of funny, if you consider sort of craziness and misery to be funny.

37
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,561
The chorus, did you notice this when you read it?

38
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,200
That you think maybe there's some kind of misprint.

39
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:30,040
The chorus literally keeps repeating itself, the furies.

40
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:37,480
They just go back to saying exactly what they said on page 163, gods of the younger generation, you have written down.

41
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,201
Guess what?

42
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:41,240
She makes her speech, she shows that she cares.

43
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,841
She offers them a new job.

44
00:04:42,841 --> 00:04:43,800
What do they say?

45
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,920
Gods of the younger generation, you have written down the laws of elder time, torn them out of my hands, I disinherited, and so forth.

46
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,521
They just go ranting on, repeating themselves.

47
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:02,360
And that's because they're so upset, being very emotional, that they can't even hear her.

48
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:11,721
And when you're really angry and somebody else is trying to either apologize or explain or anything, you're just too upset even to hear them.

49
00:05:11,721 --> 00:05:16,201
That's exactly what Aeschylus is putting on the stage in a very funny way.

50
00:05:16,201 --> 00:05:17,000
So there they go.

51
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,281
They rant on the same speech exactly.

52
00:05:20,281 --> 00:05:27,240
And she goes on trying to explain to them that it's not true what they're saying, that they're dishonored.

53
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,081
She says, no, not dishonored.

54
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:30,601
This is on the middle of 164.

55
00:05:30,961 --> 00:05:32,321
You are goddesses.

56
00:05:34,561 --> 00:05:39,841
Do not, in too much anger, make this place of mortal men uninhabitable.

57
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:46,241
Then she threatens them with the thunderbolts, but doesn't really come do anything about it.

58
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:55,441
She promises them, though, at the end of that little speech, you shall win first fruits and offering for children and the marriage right for always.

59
00:05:55,441 --> 00:06:10,561
She's going to switch over the marriage from the new gods and making a sort of an oath to a marriage really grounded in emotions and instinct and sensuous experience.

60
00:06:10,561 --> 00:06:13,520
She's going to hand the marriage over to the furies.

61
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,881
And what do they say?

62
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:24,961
Well, they say the same thing, what they just said before, that they could, a little variation, that they could treat me so, I, the mind of the past, to be driven underground.

63
00:06:24,961 --> 00:06:30,721
I mean, there's straight out repression, driven underground, outcast, like dirt.

64
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:43,041
And they get very upset and they talk about at the top of 165, they have wiped me out and the hard hands of the gods and their treacheries have taken my old rights away.

65
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,561
So they really got there.

66
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,681
They've been dishonored.

67
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,841
They've been disenfranchised.

68
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:49,841
They've been mistreated.

69
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:51,760
And Athena, what does she do?

70
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:57,360
She just keeps telling them her story in a total dialogue of non-listening.

71
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,041
So she, well, she's listening.

72
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:03,841
They're not listening because every time they say something, she answers it.

73
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:05,601
She says, I will bear your angers.

74
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:07,281
You are elder-born than I.

75
00:07:07,441 --> 00:07:10,480
And in that, you are wiser, far than I.

76
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:21,320
I mean, she, unlike Apollo, who thinks that they're just sort of hopeless idiots because they're primitive and have these sort of basic views of the world, that they're stupid.

77
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:29,321
And she sees, no, no, the emotional side of the world has something really important going for it and tells them so.

78
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:37,081
And they are going to get at the end of her speech, she says, don't turn your battle.

79
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,360
Well, I don't want to read that yet, I think.

80
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,081
Just a second.

81
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:40,681
I got to see where I am.

82
00:07:40,921 --> 00:07:43,081
So I have to sort of reorder things.

83
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,240
They rant about being repressed.

84
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,601
That's where I am.

85
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:47,961
And she shows her respect.

86
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:51,801
That's what I just read, saying, you're smarter than I am.

87
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:59,801
And she says they shouldn't really be carrying on fights between families in the city.

88
00:07:59,801 --> 00:08:02,361
They should fight foreign foes.

89
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:09,321
She says that at the end of her speech: Don't turn your fury inward on yourselves, on themselves.

90
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:15,881
Let our wars range outward, hard against the man who has fallen horribly in love with high renown.

91
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:27,081
That is, another translation: one who tries to satisfy his lust for fame.

92
00:08:27,081 --> 00:08:29,801
There's real pride, and they're against pride.

93
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:30,921
She is too.

94
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:38,201
And one who has fallen horribly in love with high renown, and no true fighter fights at home, she wants to say.

95
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:43,881
And then she's still showing her patience.

96
00:08:44,201 --> 00:08:47,480
And do they make another rant, or is this part of the same speech by her?

97
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,281
I forget.

98
00:08:48,281 --> 00:08:53,640
No, they make another rant that they could treat me so, the mind of the past, cast out like dirt.

99
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:59,401
It's amazing how they can just say the same, not literally the same words this time, but it's the same idea.

100
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:05,841
And she says, quite correctly, I will not weary of telling you all the good things I offer.

101
00:09:00,201 --> 00:09:08,480
I mean, she's just saying, I'm going to just persist.

102
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:17,041
She knows what everybody knows, that when you're in an outrage of anger, if you give somebody time, they can't help it.

103
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:17,921
They calm down.

104
00:09:17,921 --> 00:09:22,081
That's this whole story about how the emotions get tired and go to sleep.

105
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:35,360
So she's waiting and telling them, and sooner or later, she thinks they'll stop being in such a fit and outrage and rant and listen.

106
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,401
And that's what happens.

107
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,841
It's almost funny.

108
00:09:37,841 --> 00:09:41,041
So she says, I'll not weary of telling you the good things.

109
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:53,681
And she says, if you hold persuasion has her sacred place of worship and the sweet beguilement of my voice, she's saying, I don't just make speeches like Apollo.

110
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:04,161
I make, I talk in a sweet way, and I try to take into account the concerns of the people I'm talking to.

111
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:15,841
She's got something behind the different than just ranting on the one extreme, which is what the Furies are doing, and making sort of abstract pronouncements, which is what Apollo does.

112
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:18,560
She is always persuasive.

113
00:10:18,561 --> 00:10:20,161
That's a third thing.

114
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,880
That takes account of the current situation and is sensitive, attuned to it.

115
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,921
Athena hasn't changed all that much from Athena of the Odyssey.

116
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,521
So, and what happens then?

117
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,881
This is the funny part.

118
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,521
All of a sudden, they get it.

119
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,240
They've gotten sufficiently cooled off.

120
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:48,761
She says the same thing she's been saying, and they say, on the middle of 166, Lady Athena, what is this place you say is mine?

121
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,480
Boom!

122
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,001
The coin has dropped.

123
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,281
They see now that she's telling them something important, and they're ready to listen to it.

124
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,120
And she says, no household shall be prosperous without your will.

125
00:11:00,441 --> 00:11:04,281
And they say, you will really let me be so strong.

126
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,721
And she says, we.

127
00:11:05,721 --> 00:11:08,120
She puts them, she gets them together on her side.

128
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,041
She's building a consensus.

129
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:14,041
We shall straighten the lives of all who worship us.

130
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,480
Athena says that.

131
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:17,961
That's the big switch over.

132
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:20,120
They're now on the same team.

133
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,921
And then they say this interesting thing.

134
00:11:22,921 --> 00:11:25,961
You guarantee such honor for the rest of time.

135
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,321
And what she says is fascinating.

136
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,081
I have no need to promise what I cannot do.

137
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,921
So what does that mean?

138
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:36,601
I think, did I talk about that already?

139
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:37,640
It sounds familiar.

140
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:45,401
Okay, well, they, of course, want to have whatever this solution is count forever.

141
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,761
But Athena, you know, I think, knows that it's a cultural solution.

142
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,801
And as a cultural solution, it's vulnerable.

143
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:59,480
The culture can go back into this kind of problem, or it could go all super, super rational.

144
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:09,561
Nietzsche says that in the next generation with Socrates and Plato, the Greeks become mad with rationality.

145
00:12:09,561 --> 00:12:12,120
That would be just to go over on the side of Apollo.

146
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:21,881
She knows that it's a solution that requires that they continually preserve it.

147
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,920
It isn't something built into the nature of things.

148
00:12:24,921 --> 00:12:26,921
It's a cultural achievement.

149
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,281
And so she says, I've no need to promise what I can't do.

150
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:38,801
That is, she can't promise, and she knows it's, she probably knows, that she can't promise that this cultural achievement is going to last forever.

151
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:42,321
In fact, the cultural achievement really can't last forever.

152
00:12:42,321 --> 00:12:48,480
Heidegger says that all these works of art and the cultures that they focus die eventually.

153
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,601
People will stop believing in them for various reasons.

154
00:12:51,601 --> 00:12:53,361
So she doesn't promise them.

155
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,521
But anyway, they don't insist.

156
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,000
They say, I think you have your way with me.

157
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,921
My hate is going.

158
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:11,841
And why is she able to get rid of their anger and their hatred and their bitterness and their harshness and all that so seemingly so easily?

159
00:13:11,841 --> 00:13:32,240
I'm answering this because I was asked by somebody, I don't remember who, sort of to explain this sort of thing that it looks too easy for Athena just to flip the furies over out of their harshness into becoming what will be later called the kindly ones.

160
00:13:32,961 --> 00:13:35,920
But I've tried to prepare you for that.

161
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:54,880
Because if what's making them harsh and angry and full of hate and bitterness and so forth is that they've been repressed, that they are dishonored, that they haven't been given any lawful place, they don't have any job, they don't have any respect, then all Athena has to do is give them all that.

162
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,561
And they stop being crazy and nasty and ranting, and they do that.

163
00:14:00,561 --> 00:14:01,760
They stop that.

164
00:14:01,761 --> 00:14:17,960
She gives a little speech here on 167, which reconciles the two kinds of gods as a kind of way of stating that there's now a kind of us and a kind of agreement.

165
00:14:18,281 --> 00:14:25,161
Something that has no traffic with evil success, let it come out of the ground, out of the sea is water, from the high air.

166
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:30,920
I don't know about the sea is water, but something in the ground and in the high air gets together.

167
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:36,920
And in gentle gales, it washes over the country in full sunlight.

168
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,561
That's the light part.

169
00:14:39,561 --> 00:14:41,401
And somewhere there ought to be the dark part.

170
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,161
Yes, and the seed and stream of the soils yield, that's the ground part.

171
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,760
There's the sky and the ground, the light, and implicitly the dark, all in here, and so forth.

172
00:14:52,601 --> 00:15:00,920
Then be strong and never fail our people as time goes and make the human scene be kept alive.

173
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:09,400
And then she says at the end of that speech, which is something very interesting: all such is yours for granting.

174
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,480
All such is yours for granting.

175
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:19,321
That's this new fertile, positive world that they can create.

176
00:15:19,321 --> 00:15:26,601
In the speech and show and pride of battle, I myself shall not endure the city's eclipse in the estimation of mankind.

177
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:29,880
Now I want to say something about that, but I'm not sure I want to say it yet.

178
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,160
Let me see.

179
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:41,800
He promises, and I'm going to come back to this later when I talk about the understanding of being, that already what's being said implicitly in this by Aeschylus.

180
00:15:41,801 --> 00:15:47,081
I don't even know whether he's conscious of it because the understanding of being is so pervasive.

181
00:15:47,081 --> 00:16:05,760
But what she's saying is, and he's showing, is that if you can bring out the best in anybody or anything, if you cultivate it, if you are friendly to it, if you let it develop in its own way, then it will be positive and happy, and all kinds of good things will happen.

182
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:18,160
All bad things happen when you try to force something on people or anything, and don't let it just come forth at its own way.

183
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,440
And she's let the Furies come forth and do their own thing, and so they're happy.

184
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:31,360
I'll come back to that because I can't do two things at once, and that's got to do with their new understanding of being.

185
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,241
So the Furies ask for a guarantee.

186
00:16:36,241 --> 00:16:37,280
I just read that.

187
00:16:37,281 --> 00:16:39,040
Athena doesn't promise it.

188
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:44,561
It lasts about 100 years from 432, not even 100 years, about 80 years.

189
00:16:44,561 --> 00:16:49,920
From 432 to 404, they have this golden age of Athens.

190
00:16:50,081 --> 00:16:54,561
Then they start making mistakes and they start dividing up into factions.

191
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:55,280
Yeah.

192
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:56,081
It's still hard.

193
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,601
Well, I'm glad you put your hand up.

194
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:58,641
I wonder what I can do.

195
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,920
John, Dave, let's see how far we can move this nearer.

196
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,241
But it doesn't help.

197
00:17:06,241 --> 00:17:06,880
I looked in there.

198
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,601
It was all set at maximum.

199
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:11,360
Okay, let's see.

200
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:14,561
Okay, that's one thing I can do.

201
00:17:14,561 --> 00:17:16,640
And I can just talk louder.

202
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,720
This one is on.

203
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,481
This one is on.

204
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:21,280
I don't know about this one.

205
00:17:22,481 --> 00:17:23,601
This is on.

206
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:24,481
Put this back.

207
00:17:24,481 --> 00:17:25,281
Is this on?

208
00:17:25,761 --> 00:17:26,880
But it's not supposed to be.

209
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,161
That's the one for the podcast.

210
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,200
Okay.

211
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,160
Okay, okay, let's see now.

212
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,281
And let's look over here.

213
00:17:33,281 --> 00:17:39,760
But I think that the this projection power microphone, microphone volume.

214
00:17:39,761 --> 00:17:40,240
I'll try it.

215
00:17:40,321 --> 00:17:41,841
Where's the key at this point?

216
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:43,040
Do I have it?

217
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,561
I think I have it.

218
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,880
Yeah.

219
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,001
I've looked before.

220
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:48,440
I think the microphone volume.

221
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,641
Oh, I remember.

222
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:52,761
We can try to do the microphone volume, but we may get feedback.

223
00:17:53,001 --> 00:17:55,801
In which case, we may have to move the table back.

224
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:57,640
Let's struggle with it.

225
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,041
Okay.

226
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,801
Microphone.

227
00:18:00,281 --> 00:18:01,321
This is full up.

228
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:02,201
This is full up.

229
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,160
This is full up.

230
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,681
Wireless we don't want to mess with.

231
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:08,441
Because that's the one that's the yeah.

232
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,321
Okay, let's try it.

233
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:09,880
Put it up.

234
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,321
And does it make any difference?

235
00:18:11,561 --> 00:18:12,680
Yeah, it is.

236
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,281
Oh, okay.

237
00:18:14,601 --> 00:18:15,880
Hey, I think we did it.

238
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,760
Thanks.

239
00:18:16,761 --> 00:18:18,761
Yeah, and it isn't feeding back either.

240
00:18:18,761 --> 00:18:19,880
How's that?

241
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,841
Terrific.

242
00:18:20,841 --> 00:18:22,120
Okay, let's remember that.

243
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,440
We've got a million things to do every time when we come in.

244
00:18:24,761 --> 00:18:26,440
Just add it to the list.

245
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,640
Uh-oh.

246
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,561
Is that echoing too much now?

247
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:30,041
No?

248
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,321
Okay, that's good.

249
00:18:31,321 --> 00:18:32,281
Where were we?

250
00:18:33,081 --> 00:18:34,520
Athena can't promise.

251
00:18:34,521 --> 00:18:44,520
It only lasts something like 70 years before the Athens is destroyed in kind of internal troubles.

252
00:18:44,841 --> 00:18:46,601
But it lasts then.

253
00:18:46,601 --> 00:18:50,440
And then comes the interesting thing.

254
00:18:50,440 --> 00:19:01,480
And I do want to say this next, that it's that she says that they will not be eclipsed in the estimation of mankind.

255
00:19:01,481 --> 00:19:05,160
Notice, she doesn't say that they will last forever.

256
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,841
She says they will be admired forever.

257
00:19:08,841 --> 00:19:22,120
So I'm going to read you something from this important book written at the same time as the Orestea, and or a little later, a generation later, maybe, the Peloponnesian Wars by Thucydides.

258
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,440
You may have heard the name.

259
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:30,601
I hadn't when I was your age, but things from how many have heard of Thucydides?

260
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,880
Aye, progress, yes.

261
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,960
Or you have better schools now.

262
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:42,321
So then there's the Peloponnesian Wars, war, singular, seems, and that's by Thucydides.

263
00:19:42,321 --> 00:19:44,640
He only seems to have one name.

264
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,401
I'm trying to write big, but I can't write so that the board is clear enough to read anything on it.

265
00:19:52,400 --> 00:20:18,160
Okay, Thucydides is telling about Athens as it is at the time that Aeschylus is writing, which is, you know, Aeschylus is projecting back into the past how Athens became this place which will always, which will never be eclipsed in the estimation of mankind.

266
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,321
I'll just read you one thing, one thing from Pericles here.

267
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:25,601
I'll read you something else in a little while.

268
00:20:26,241 --> 00:20:38,400
So Pericles is the president, or whatever he's called, the leader, and he's giving his great funeral address and what it was, why Athens is worth dying for.

269
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,521
The Gettysburg Address is modeled on this, they say.

270
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:49,120
Lincoln knew the famous funeral oration of Pericles when he gave his Gettysburg funeral oration.

271
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:59,520
He says, The admiration of the present and succeeding ages will be ours, since we have not left our power without witness, but have shown it by mighty proofs.

272
00:20:59,521 --> 00:21:16,521
And far from needing a Homer, for our panegyrist or others of his craft, whose verses might charm for the moment only, for the impression that they gave to melt in the touch, which moment only for the impression which they gave to melt at the touch of fact.

273
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:21,081
See, he thinks Homer's just legend, whereas they really achieved this.

274
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:31,960
We have forced every sea and land to be the highway of our daring, and everywhere, whether for evil or for good, we've left imperishable monuments behind us.

275
00:21:32,521 --> 00:21:39,641
I'm going to read you a little more later, but just that's already saying, well, no, I really have to read the rest, though I wasn't planning to.

276
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,321
Why shouldn't I?

277
00:21:41,321 --> 00:21:49,960
Because I haven't really told you that the sense in which it no, no, that's enough.

278
00:21:50,601 --> 00:22:12,440
There is another place, but I won't try to find it, where Pericles says: even if all the monuments that we've made, even if our civilization, our culture, is destroyed, the monuments that we leave behind will make a bigger impression than any monuments even now existing or ever to exist in any other culture.

279
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:23,801
I'm not quite paraphrasing it right, but roughly, if you dig up the ruins of Athens, he says, it'll be greater and more impressive than any ruins ever.

280
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:27,720
And the funny thing is, the amazing thing is, that's right.

281
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:33,240
We are still reading the Aeschylus from that period.

282
00:22:33,801 --> 00:22:37,400
People are still going to see the Acropolis and the Parthenon.

283
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,680
And history begins with Thucydides, and everybody pays tribute to that.

284
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,920
And science begins with math.

285
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,200
They did everything.

286
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:54,841
And even when they were destroyed, everything they did lives after them, and everything they did we still admire.

287
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:57,401
And Athena says that's right.

288
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,561
They'll never be eclipsed in the estimation of mankind.

289
00:23:00,561 --> 00:23:02,480
And that seems true.

290
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,561
So we can go on then.

291
00:23:00,281 --> 00:23:06,401
And 160.

292
00:23:08,241 --> 00:23:11,200
So the furies become happy.

293
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,520
They become the source of fertility instead of destruction.

294
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:20,480
On 168, they're making a kind of fertility speech.

295
00:23:20,481 --> 00:23:29,920
Fox, flocks fatten, earth be kind to them with double fold of fruit in time appropriated for us for its yielding.

296
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:35,520
Secret child of earth, her hidden wealth bestow, blessing and surprise of gods.

297
00:23:35,521 --> 00:23:50,640
Well, all that is, in effect, if you mix the earth and the sun in the right way, the dark and the light in the right way, you get fertile crops and happy flocks, and they're going to support that.

298
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,561
So Athena's very pleased.

299
00:23:52,561 --> 00:23:54,240
This time it really worked.

300
00:23:54,241 --> 00:23:55,761
I mean, it's not a reversal.

301
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:59,520
It looks like a real success, and it is a real success.

302
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:02,481
She's very pleased on the middle of 169.

303
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:12,400
She says, I admire the eyes of persuasion who guided the speech of my mouth toward these when they were reluctant and wild.

304
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,720
Zeus, who guides men's speech and counsels, was too strong, and my ambition for good wins out in the whole issue.

305
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,880
And the chorus agrees.

306
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:28,321
They make a happy speech in which they say, in effect, everything is going to be all right.

307
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,480
I'll read that one later, I think.

308
00:24:30,481 --> 00:24:31,761
And let me see my notes.

309
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,440
Yeah, no, I'm not quite ready for that.

310
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:48,041
The next thing to say is just to sum up what happened with that when the hate and all that is gone, because they got a position, they are transformed into a new kind of being.

311
00:24:49,241 --> 00:24:58,040
They are as transformed as people could get who had been repressed and treated badly and then all of a sudden were treated goodly.

312
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,960
Well, they have become the kindly ones.

313
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,440
That's what humanities means.

314
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,961
They're no longer the Furies.

315
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,321
They're no longer the Irenes, which is another name for the Furies.

316
00:25:09,321 --> 00:25:11,081
They are the humanities.

317
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,401
And I'm going to just read this, Beatrice, and then I'll let you talk.

318
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:36,681
On 171, we hear the chorus saying, Maidens, wives, elderly women in procession, in the investiture of purple-stained robes, dignify them and let the torchlight go before, so that that kindly company, that's the only reference it makes to the fact that they've become humanities.

319
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,360
So you just got to notice it.

320
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:46,360
That kindly company, now the humanities, of these within our ground may shine in the future, the strong men to come.

321
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:51,161
And notice again, and I just noticed as I read it, that there's again always reconciling.

322
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,280
I was thinking too bad.

323
00:25:52,281 --> 00:25:58,040
Maidens, wives, elder women, that's all very well, but it looks like it's gone all over on the side of women.

324
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:03,321
And what you want is both the old gods and the women and the new gods and the men.

325
00:26:03,481 --> 00:26:10,120
Just before the end of the paragraph, Aeschylus must realize this too, and he says, may shine forth in the future of young men to come.

326
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,681
So the men and women are all together in there.

327
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,321
I think that's always going to be the way it is.

328
00:26:15,321 --> 00:26:17,160
Now, Beatrice, I'm ready to.

329
00:26:17,801 --> 00:26:23,321
They say this is my faird civil war pattern on Maslow and Shamat Thunder in our studio.

330
00:26:23,321 --> 00:26:28,601
It's just we need to go to war because we think we're very specific.

331
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,841
It's not really what the theories were after.

332
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:32,481
About.

333
00:26:32,481 --> 00:26:33,360
That's right.

334
00:26:30,521 --> 00:26:37,441
Civil war, it really should be sort of family war.

335
00:26:37,601 --> 00:26:39,681
Let's look at the let's look.

336
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,401
The civil war doesn't seem the right way to describe it.

337
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,440
I agree with you.

338
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,240
So let's look at 980.

339
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:59,120
Remember, I told you this, I put this a copy of this book, which is the most literal translation, on reserve in the Philosophy Library, and a copy of Latimer, which is the most literal of the poetic translations, also.

340
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:05,680
So when you're writing your paper, if you see things you don't like, the first thing you can do is look and see if it's wrong.

341
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:12,880
And if you're doing well, you'll find lots of places where you can change the translation to make it work.

342
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,481
So let's see about Civil War on 980.

343
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:25,041
May faction insatiate of ill never raise her loud voice within the city.

344
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:26,241
Well, there you fix it.

345
00:27:26,241 --> 00:27:27,201
You're absolutely right.

346
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,760
Faction is between families, or could be.

347
00:27:29,761 --> 00:27:32,241
Civil war isn't in the Greek.

348
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,400
Of course, faction is what it was.

349
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,240
This family against that family, this clan against that clan.

350
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,640
And that's not supposed to happen anymore.

351
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,720
That's not going to be in the city.

352
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,440
And they're all going to get along and love each other.

353
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,160
And then the end of there, I'll mention it already.

354
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:57,760
There's this interesting place for the emotions of hate, which is probably going to be part of their problem.

355
00:27:58,801 --> 00:28:00,880
Certainly, I never thought of putting it this way.

356
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,520
It's not quite solved.

357
00:28:04,321 --> 00:28:13,920
They haven't really turned all the emotions into positive emotions by giving them this expressive, cultivated honor.

358
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,920
There's still hate, but the hate isn't going to divide the city into factions anymore.

359
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:24,360
The hate is now turned against the bad guys, whoever they are.

360
00:28:26,601 --> 00:28:28,520
Let love be their common will.

361
00:28:28,521 --> 00:28:30,440
That's how they are in the city.

362
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,601
And let them hate with a single heart.

363
00:28:32,601 --> 00:28:33,801
Who are they going to hate?

364
00:28:33,801 --> 00:28:43,561
Well, I go back in this place that I said I wasn't ready to read it yet, where it looks like it's people who they think are enemies, bad countries.

365
00:28:44,521 --> 00:28:45,880
Where we find it.

366
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:52,281
On page 165, I was reading, don't turn your battle fury inward on yourself.

367
00:28:52,281 --> 00:28:54,920
That's, again, the factionalism in the city.

368
00:28:54,920 --> 00:29:01,720
Let our wars range outward, hard against the man who has fallen horribly in love with high renown.

369
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:10,281
Now, that is go against the dictators and tyrants and other bad countries.

370
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,160
They've got this thing that we've got.

371
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,401
There's the empire of evil.

372
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,480
Although we're on the empire of evil, you can still hate them and attack them.

373
00:29:19,481 --> 00:29:22,521
But inside the country, you should be unified.

374
00:29:22,521 --> 00:29:26,120
And that's as near as they come to getting it.

375
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:31,960
And unfortunately, when they fall apart, the reason they fall apart is they get involved in all these wars.

376
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,321
That's exactly the thing that Athena didn't fix.

377
00:29:35,321 --> 00:29:44,761
She was satisfied to let the hate range outward, and they go around attacking all sorts of other countries and trying to put them in their empire, very much like Iraq.

378
00:29:44,761 --> 00:30:00,400
They just see a country that's got lots of riches that they want, and they just go after it, and they usually capture it, but eventually they get so spread out in the war that they start losing, and then they start fighting with each other, and then the whole thing falls apart.

379
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:04,000
That's the story in Thucydides, if we had time.

380
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:12,480
So, anyway, Beatrice is right, translation is wrong, but nothing serious because we can easily fix it.

381
00:30:12,481 --> 00:30:15,841
It's just no factionalism in the city.

382
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,720
But the question is: how is that going to happen?

383
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,680
I haven't really told you the solution fully yet.

384
00:30:24,081 --> 00:30:25,520
What does it mean?

385
00:30:25,841 --> 00:30:27,841
Why are they the kindly ones?

386
00:30:28,321 --> 00:30:31,760
How come they became so kindly all of a sudden?

387
00:30:31,761 --> 00:30:34,880
What happened to hate and moral outrage?

388
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,480
Well, that's what I'm just saying.

389
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,200
They didn't really get rid of the hate and the outrage.

390
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:51,920
They just got rid of the Klan fighting and the vengeance fighting, the sort of mafia structure of the culture, but their hate is still there against all these other cultures and other countries they consider evil.

391
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:59,361
But there is some more positive thing happening, which is really what I call the second solution.

392
00:30:59,361 --> 00:31:04,160
That why are they all united in love in that passage I read?

393
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,960
Love be their common will at the bottom of 69.

394
00:31:06,961 --> 00:31:08,640
What sort of love is it?

395
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,601
And why is it that it unites everybody?

396
00:31:11,601 --> 00:31:13,921
Well, that's the great coup.

397
00:31:13,921 --> 00:31:20,961
What happens is she's created a new emotion of patriotism.

398
00:31:20,961 --> 00:31:24,640
That they love Athens.

399
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,400
That's what they end up loving.

400
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:57,961
And they are the new emotion which leads to unity and not contradiction, which puts the, is an emotion which puts the community first, that is the city-state, and that is Athens, above any of the local interests or any of the family interests or any of the clan or private interests, not in an abstract way like Apollo does, but by filling them all with the same love, namely, of Athens.

401
00:31:57,961 --> 00:32:02,120
It's sort of like this famous quote you hear from Kennedy, John F.

402
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:07,801
Kay, every once in a while: ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.

403
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:13,160
That is, the most important thing is to love Athens.

404
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:18,840
Well, it isn't all that clear in here, but it's very clear in Thucydides.

405
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,041
And this is what I kept saying.

406
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:20,601
I will read it.

407
00:32:20,601 --> 00:32:25,961
No, I won't read it because I wanted to resist reading it until you get it until it's right on.

408
00:32:25,961 --> 00:32:31,160
This is exactly the love that's going to get rid of all factionalism.

409
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:58,120
On page 112 of my copy, anyway, it says, Pericles says, you must realize the power of Athens and feed your eyes upon her day to day till love of her fills your hearts, and then with all her greatness, and then when all her greatness shall break upon you, you must reflect that it was by courage and sense of duty and a feeling of honor in action that men weren't able to win all this.

410
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:04,360
That's partly the funeral oration part, that you admire the soldiers who gave their life for it.

411
00:33:04,361 --> 00:33:06,361
That's not what I'm going to emphasize.

412
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:10,681
The main thing to emphasize is you see how great Athens is.

413
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,721
You're totally overwhelmed by admiration.

414
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,721
You know, they've invented democracy.

415
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:21,481
They've invented uh a whole uh new moral order.

416
00:33:21,481 --> 00:33:34,160
They've invented the the the jury system, and they've and they are now supposed to be, and they are, filled with their the the the the love of Athens fills their hearts.

417
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,481
That's the second solution.

418
00:33:36,481 --> 00:34:01,041
Uh that's that's what really unifies the culture, is that there is if it wasn't that there was something so great that they could all just be blown away with loving it and ready to do anything for it, there wouldn't have been this kind of unity and wouldn't trump all families, all clans, all special interest groups, all private craziness.

419
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:03,921
But there is, namely Athens.

420
00:34:03,921 --> 00:34:11,040
And that's all in here, and it's expressed in the procession that you hear about on 171.

421
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,440
I've read the beginning of it already.

422
00:34:13,441 --> 00:34:24,320
All the women and even the men are, particularly right now as we're hearing about the women, they're going to their special place in the bottom.

423
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:25,440
I have to read you this.

424
00:34:25,441 --> 00:34:27,521
The procession has two parts.

425
00:34:27,521 --> 00:34:34,401
There's the procession where all the women lead the furies to their new home, where they'll be respected and fertile and do good.

426
00:34:34,401 --> 00:34:40,001
And then there's another procession of it, another part of the procession I don't want to talk about quite yet.

427
00:34:40,001 --> 00:34:41,441
But let's read this part.

428
00:34:41,441 --> 00:34:53,601
They're going to there, in the middle of the page, they're going to the primal dark of earthly hollows, held in high veneration, with right back with this fill, bless them, all people with silence.

429
00:34:53,601 --> 00:34:57,041
These are the women marching down to their new place.

430
00:34:57,041 --> 00:34:59,120
Gracious, well, who's talking here?

431
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,081
Athena?

432
00:35:00,081 --> 00:35:00,881
I hope.

433
00:35:00,881 --> 00:35:02,001
Yeah, I can't see.

434
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:03,840
My book is panting shape.

435
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,760
Yeah, well, no, or is it the chorus?

436
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,120
Well, who what's talking here?

437
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:07,840
Athena.

438
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,721
Okay, good.

439
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,801
Be gracious be, I'm at the very end of the play now.

440
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,881
Wi gracious be, wish what the land wishes.

441
00:35:18,361 --> 00:35:30,120
Follow grave goddesses, calling them goddesses, of course, rushed in the flame-sprung torchlight, yea on your journey, singing all, follow our footsteps.

442
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:37,961
There shall be peace forever between these people, Pallas, remember that's Athena, and their guests, that's the humanities.

443
00:35:38,521 --> 00:35:39,640
Peace forever.

444
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:41,960
Athena's getting a bit carried away there.

445
00:35:41,961 --> 00:35:43,561
I can't do much about that.

446
00:35:43,561 --> 00:35:44,361
What?

447
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:46,920
Oh, I'm glad to.

448
00:35:47,001 --> 00:35:47,481
Oh, yeah.

449
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:48,680
Oh, better, better.

450
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,720
Yes, Athena.

451
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,360
Thanks.

452
00:35:50,361 --> 00:35:53,001
I thought I didn't see that in the middle of the page.

453
00:35:53,481 --> 00:35:56,360
Okay, so the chorus, of course, thinks it's forever.

454
00:35:56,361 --> 00:36:00,841
They're inside it, and they don't understand it as a cultural achievement.

455
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:09,481
They understand it as a recognition of their ancient and always rights, just as Apollo thinks that he's always new and right.

456
00:36:11,001 --> 00:36:21,081
And so they think it's forever, this new reconciliation, between Pallas, which is Athena who stands in for the new gods, and their guests, that's the humanities.

457
00:36:21,081 --> 00:36:22,360
Who's the all-seeing?

458
00:36:22,361 --> 00:36:29,241
Remember, he's behind everything, met with destiny to confirm it, singing all follow the footsteps.

459
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:33,961
Now, that's very, very interesting, that last line.

460
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:37,081
Who's the all that's following the footsteps?

461
00:36:37,081 --> 00:36:51,001
Well, there is the priestesses, the priestesses of Athena get mentioned, and there's the humanities who are in there, and there's, I guess those are the main ones.

462
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:55,321
And it isn't clear yet who the other, who the all is.

463
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,001
And I tell you, there are long detours required to understand that.

464
00:36:59,001 --> 00:37:01,681
And that's what I'm calling the third solution.

465
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:12,561
The third solution is the important one for this course, for Heidegger and me anyway, and probably for everybody.

466
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:18,001
The third solution is to turn the whole thing into a work of art.

467
00:37:18,001 --> 00:37:24,880
And that's even more than just getting them all to agree how great Athens is.

468
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,361
What would you have to do besides that?

469
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:46,241
You'd have to show them how great Athens is and get them to all see, that they all see that this is a great, that Athens is so great that it can solve the problems of the culture and make it into a kind of fruitful culture.

470
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,361
And that's, I have to explain that now more.

471
00:37:49,361 --> 00:37:55,440
And it's so tricky that I have to read it because I lose track, as you'll see, when I try to say it.

472
00:37:55,921 --> 00:38:00,401
Because it's so what I'm calling self-referential.

473
00:38:00,401 --> 00:38:09,360
The play is making itself into a work of art, and it knows it's making itself into a work of art, and they know it's making itself aware.

474
00:38:09,441 --> 00:38:24,001
What is it to be a work of art, remember, is to hold up to the people and shine and glamorize and let them all see what it is that they all believe in, what it is that they all stand for.

475
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:30,721
And that creates a whole understanding as it's happening.

476
00:38:31,361 --> 00:38:36,401
The work of art articulates the understanding of being and makes it work.

477
00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:38,640
So now let me read it in as many ways.

478
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,920
Yeah, good, say something.

479
00:38:40,481 --> 00:38:41,760
Yes, that's a heat.

480
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,640
Exactly.

481
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,041
Good.

482
00:38:43,041 --> 00:38:44,480
Yes, I was setting it up.

483
00:38:44,481 --> 00:38:52,201
He's articulating a story that will show them how they got to be so great and why they're so great.

484
00:38:52,521 --> 00:38:57,081
And the crazy thing is, I want to say over and over again: and what made them so great?

485
00:38:57,081 --> 00:38:59,640
Their realization that they were so great.

486
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,801
That's the peculiar part of it.

487
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:10,920
Their pride and patriotism solves all these problems, and they are proud and patriotic because they solved all these problems.

488
00:39:10,921 --> 00:39:14,601
It's very, very peculiarly circular.

489
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:17,481
So you see why I want to read it, because I have trouble saying it.

490
00:39:17,561 --> 00:39:19,401
So I said it pretty well just then.

491
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:20,761
So let me try again.

492
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,840
So this is the third solution.

493
00:39:23,401 --> 00:39:33,080
We set up the courts, we transformed the Furies into humanities, and now produced a new emotion of pride in the glory of Athens.

494
00:39:33,401 --> 00:39:38,920
And this is as far as the critics have seen, I think.

495
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:42,280
Now comes this funny move that Heidegger would see.

496
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:48,440
He doesn't write about this play, but he writes about works of art in general and articulating.

497
00:39:48,441 --> 00:39:49,961
So what would he say?

498
00:39:49,961 --> 00:39:59,961
Well, the emotions of vengeance and civil war have been turned into the emotions of loyalty and patriotism and love of Athens.

499
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:06,360
I wasn't into the love part last time when I wrote these notes.

500
00:40:06,361 --> 00:40:07,960
I want to write it in.

501
00:40:09,561 --> 00:40:10,920
Yeah, no pen.

502
00:40:10,921 --> 00:40:12,440
Okay, I still remember.

503
00:40:13,081 --> 00:40:13,800
So where are we?

504
00:40:14,521 --> 00:40:15,720
Okay, why?

505
00:40:16,361 --> 00:40:18,921
So what are the Athenians to be proud of?

506
00:40:18,921 --> 00:40:26,441
Just this, that they've turned the primitive and tribal emotions into patriotic emotions of love of the whole city.

507
00:40:26,441 --> 00:40:29,160
So, the feeling is self-referential.

508
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:38,401
Their patriotism is what makes them proud, and their pride is what makes them their patriotism.

509
00:40:38,401 --> 00:40:43,521
They're proud of their city because it produced the new emotion of patriotic pride.

510
00:40:43,521 --> 00:40:46,881
That's so weird that I have to keep saying it.

511
00:40:46,881 --> 00:40:54,801
If we ask how this pride was achieved, it was done by holding up to the people what they had done that they should be proud of.

512
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,321
And what was that?

513
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:01,200
Well, to become the, to all agree to love the city.

514
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,761
And how did that happen?

515
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:14,560
Well, something like this play does the job of producing the pride by showing them what the city stands for, that they should be proud of.

516
00:41:14,561 --> 00:41:16,401
That's what the play is about.

517
00:41:16,401 --> 00:41:23,681
So, the play is not really, in fact, about this pride and this patriotism and this love, it's producing.

518
00:41:24,001 --> 00:41:26,401
And that's a work of art working.

519
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:36,400
It's turned them into unified Athenian Athens lovers who put the love of Athens above everything, as Pericles says.

520
00:41:36,401 --> 00:41:38,640
He's a work of art, too, from a Heideggerian point of view.

521
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,601
The funeral oration does the same job.

522
00:41:41,921 --> 00:41:42,880
They're good at this.

523
00:41:42,881 --> 00:41:51,281
They understood how to hold up to themselves what's great about themselves and make them that much greater as they do it.

524
00:41:52,081 --> 00:41:54,801
So, let me see if I can say again.

525
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:04,961
So, they should be proud of integrating and cultivating the primitive emotions that they've turned into humanities, and they should be proud of the love of Athens.

526
00:42:04,961 --> 00:42:11,601
And this produces the Athenians as Athenians.

527
00:42:11,601 --> 00:42:18,921
That is, they become this special kind of people who put the unity of their city above everything.

528
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:27,481
I mean, they're not like an empire like Persia, which isn't run by love, but by some tyrannical leader.

529
00:42:27,481 --> 00:42:32,201
And they're certainly not anymore like a lot of families all fighting with each other.

530
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:41,401
They've got a special thing, love of that polis, in which they all vote, in which they all take a part, take part.

531
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:50,441
And so, who's in the sacred procession at the end, at the bottom of the very last line of the play?

532
00:42:50,441 --> 00:42:53,561
Well, for one thing, you've got to be very careful.

533
00:42:53,561 --> 00:42:57,481
It says, exit everybody in procession.

534
00:42:57,481 --> 00:42:59,160
Well, who's everybody?

535
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:08,601
And why should we believe what's in italics anyway, since the italics were telling us the 12 jurors that was just stuck in there by the translator?

536
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,000
Is it really everybody?

537
00:43:11,001 --> 00:43:12,761
And who are they?

538
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,361
Okay, let's see now.

539
00:43:15,001 --> 00:43:17,081
I'm reading, I'm repeating myself a lot.

540
00:43:17,081 --> 00:43:25,640
So the words of the play are actually making it happen that they all feel this love and devotion to Athens.

541
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:30,120
It doesn't talk about it, it actually produces it.

542
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:35,240
And then they're feeling these emotions and what?

543
00:43:35,561 --> 00:43:39,081
And, oh, yeah, and the work of art is supposed to shine.

544
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,840
That's a funny word for it.

545
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:45,320
Remember, I said it looks so glamorized that everybody sees everything in the light of it.

546
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,001
Well, this play is like that.

547
00:43:47,001 --> 00:44:06,480
Remember that this play is the only play to be chosen to be presented every year, whereas all the other plays, even Oedipus Rex, Pretty Good Play, gets presented only during, it gets presented over and over, but only during the one year that it wins the equivalent of the Oscar for that year, and then it's gone.

548
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,640
But no reruns.

549
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,520
But this gets endless reruns every year.

550
00:44:11,521 --> 00:44:15,120
This runs, and naturally, because it shines.

551
00:44:15,521 --> 00:44:17,200
I'll see how I put that.

552
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:25,921
It's the ultimate artwork, I think, in that it does its job, it holds up to the people what they believe in and produces what they believe in.

553
00:44:25,921 --> 00:44:28,240
It's such a self-conscious work of art.

554
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:35,200
It wants to say, it holds up to the audience what it is that they share and lets them know they share it.

555
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,840
That's what it is to be a shining thing.

556
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:46,081
So that's why we can hear about their seeing everything in its light on page 171.

557
00:44:46,481 --> 00:44:47,840
Where's the light?

558
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:53,361
Oh, yeah, there we are, right with the kindly company, the humanities, at the end of the top speech.

559
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:59,361
So the kindly company who leads within our ground may shine in the future of strong men to come.

560
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:11,760
I have to push a little to get that, but there's some shining going on, and I really think it's the shining of the whole play is itself producing this.

561
00:45:11,921 --> 00:45:13,041
Think how proud you would be.

562
00:45:14,001 --> 00:45:15,360
I hope you can understand what I'm saying.

563
00:45:15,361 --> 00:45:31,521
Suppose you were in the audience, and you were seeing the story of how your culture became totally happy, unified by patriotism, solved all its problems of conflict, became a kind of model for all times for human beings, and you're in it.

564
00:45:31,521 --> 00:45:32,160
You're of it.

565
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:40,321
And you can't help but be filled with admiration and wonder and awe and love and thankful that you're part of this.

566
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,240
But that's not even the last straw.

567
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,160
Aeschylus is so incredible.

568
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,320
Then, how would you show these people that they were part of it?

569
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,360
Well, the answer is they're part of the procession.

570
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:53,880
It isn't just the women, it's the audience that marches out.

571
00:45:53,881 --> 00:45:57,400
And the procession marches out and goes through the whole city.

572
00:45:57,401 --> 00:46:02,601
It says it more fully in this team, which I trust, so I'm going to read it.

573
00:46:02,601 --> 00:46:05,720
It says, because I wondered about it.

574
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,440
I'll show you a line in the play that makes it true.

575
00:46:08,441 --> 00:46:12,120
But I'll read you what they say, what it says about it.

576
00:46:13,561 --> 00:46:27,241
The chorus is now to be solemnly conducted to the cavern beneath the hills and so forth, with whom the poet here identifies the Irene's, who were the angry ones, the avenging spirits, and so forth.

577
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,921
The procession is formed by Athena at its head.

578
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:34,280
The chorus of torchbearers follows.

579
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:38,360
The women who guard the palladium, that's Athena's temple, I think.

580
00:46:38,361 --> 00:46:38,760
Is it?

581
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,201
I don't know what it is.

582
00:46:40,521 --> 00:46:43,400
Anyway, whatever it is, and various others.

583
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:46,841
In the rear comes the whole Austin in public.

584
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:51,321
And now you still wonder, what right do they have to write that footnote?

585
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,601
And now I found it, and now I've lost it again.

586
00:46:54,601 --> 00:46:55,720
I can't be.

587
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:59,320
Right around here somewhere, you hear that they all march.

588
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,120
That's funny.

589
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:04,360
I have lost my one line that defends that.

590
00:47:05,481 --> 00:47:06,841
Help me find it.

591
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:11,961
Well, that's what the very last line I read: singing all follow our footsteps, the very last line.

592
00:47:11,961 --> 00:47:13,160
That's the idea.

593
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:18,041
I mean, even then, it seems to me you have to read something in, but I have to trust this.

594
00:47:18,041 --> 00:47:23,561
When it says, oh, it doesn't mean all those who are on stage, all the actors and actresses follow.

595
00:47:23,561 --> 00:47:35,521
It means everybody follows, because Aeschylus knows and they know that the play is producing right then them as these patriotic Athenians.

596
00:47:35,521 --> 00:47:37,201
And they know it too.

597
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:44,880
And so it's a play which is a god because it creates those people as the people they are.

598
00:47:44,881 --> 00:47:46,640
It's a kind of creator god.

599
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:51,041
It's not the kind that produces the world from on high.

600
00:47:51,521 --> 00:48:00,081
It's the shining of the temple itself that produces these people as Athenian people, which is a special kind of people.

601
00:48:00,081 --> 00:48:00,960
Well, that's it.

602
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,800
That's what I want to say about this play.

603
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,841
That's why they kept saying this is the work of art, so to speak, the mother of all works of art.

604
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:12,961
It does everything a work of art is supposed to do, and it knows it does it, and it shows it does it.

605
00:48:12,961 --> 00:48:14,881
What more could anybody want?

606
00:48:15,521 --> 00:48:18,160
So, anybody have anything to say about that?

607
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:19,601
Yeah.

608
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,201
That's right.

609
00:48:23,521 --> 00:48:24,721
That's right.

610
00:48:25,041 --> 00:48:26,240
Yes, very good.

611
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:26,880
Exactly.

612
00:48:26,881 --> 00:48:34,881
The second solution, number two, which is supposedly, which is Athena giving them respect, supposedly happened somewhere in the mythical past.

613
00:48:34,881 --> 00:48:46,081
But it leads to this actual present in which these real Athenians now have this solution that Athena and the Furies worked out, and that's it.

614
00:48:46,081 --> 00:48:46,640
That's right.

615
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,160
And Athena's in the play.

616
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:57,840
The play is a work of art because it expresses the love and patriotism of the current Athenians.

617
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:04,241
It produces the love and patriotism as the sort of essentral feature of these Athenians.

618
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:14,320
And that's that's and inside the play, you get a story about how hard it was to do that, what they're the only culture that ever succeeded, how it may last for a long time.

619
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:14,961
Let's hope so.

620
00:49:14,961 --> 00:49:18,120
It didn't, but they didn't quite get their hate under control.

621
00:49:18,441 --> 00:49:25,480
But it's they see it as something so admirable that they can devote their life to love of it.

622
00:49:25,481 --> 00:49:26,120
Yeah.

623
00:49:29,481 --> 00:49:32,201
Has what younteresting.

624
00:49:32,521 --> 00:49:33,800
Yes, I don't know.

625
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,840
That's very interesting.

626
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:39,400
I've wondered about that once, but then I sort of put it aside and I never thought about it again.

627
00:49:39,401 --> 00:49:40,921
I'll repeat his question.

628
00:49:40,921 --> 00:49:52,281
And now that this is the work of art that holds up to the people what they stand for, namely love of Athens and what human beings really are, our citizens, our voters in a democracy.

629
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,120
What about Homeric work of art?

630
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,601
Does it stop being a work of art?

631
00:49:56,601 --> 00:49:57,960
I think it does.

632
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:01,320
I think it's a, for them already, of course, for us it's a dead work.

633
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,681
Let me just think out loud.

634
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,761
Is it a dead work for them?

635
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:13,001
I think it's a dead work for them, exactly like for lots and lots of people and maybe more and more, the Bible could become a dead work.

636
00:50:13,001 --> 00:50:23,881
Then people still quote it all the time and look back at it to see what, I don't know, religious devotion could be like.

637
00:50:23,881 --> 00:50:39,481
But it's because it's true, I've read that the Odyssey is still what everybody reads and is proud of and thinks that it shows what it is to be a Greek and a father and a mother and a warrior and a good son and a good swineherd.

638
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:49,240
I think they believe, I mean, my hunch is they believe all that, but they don't deeply feel it anymore.

639
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:53,000
They don't live in it the way a goldfish lives in water.

640
00:50:53,320 --> 00:51:02,400
It's an understanding of being which they, the current people who have a different understanding of being, love and respect, but it doesn't work.

641
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:06,160
You've led me now to say what I was going to say somewhere.

642
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:14,801
I want to give you the history of being, two stages of it, so you can keep your eye open for Virgil, who is a third stage.

643
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:22,160
We've really got the Homer stage, which is, and the more I say it, the more I realize I agree with myself.

644
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:26,961
That is, I don't think that they live in it anymore.

645
00:51:26,961 --> 00:51:35,840
Athens is too civilized to have Fusis.

646
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,280
I talked about that.

647
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,081
Fusis means welling up.

648
00:51:40,081 --> 00:51:49,201
Or as I like to say from copying a friend of mine, a famous philosopher, Dick Rorty Wunthinov, welling up is Heidegger's word for it.

649
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:55,841
Frisis is Heidegger's claim that that word names a certain understanding of being.

650
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,160
And what sort of understanding of being?

651
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:03,681
Well, one in which, let me get my notes so I can do this justice.

652
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,761
So it means nature.

653
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,800
And our word physics comes from this word pieces.

654
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,640
But nature meant something very different to them than it does to us.

655
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,241
Nature meant this business of welling up.

656
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,520
And what wells up?

657
00:52:19,521 --> 00:52:24,881
And the Iliad is the sort of poem that focuses this thesis more than the Odyssey does.

658
00:52:24,881 --> 00:52:26,720
I mean, what wells up in the Iliad?

659
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,881
Well, heroes well up.

660
00:52:28,881 --> 00:52:32,721
Anger and and overwhelming moods.

661
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,481
The gods show up.

662
00:52:34,481 --> 00:52:36,881
Wild animals get talked about.

663
00:52:36,881 --> 00:52:45,201
Brilliant ideas presumably show up, though I can't think of any, we don't really told when when Odysseus or how he gets his brilliant idea to make the horse.

664
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,561
But storms certainly well up a lot.

665
00:52:47,561 --> 00:52:51,080
Poseidon is a big feature in the throes business.

666
00:52:51,081 --> 00:52:57,560
And you get the feeling that whenever they're out at sea, that's when I think I mentioned this already when I mentioned the passaway.

667
00:52:57,561 --> 00:53:03,240
I mean, you get this feeling of suddenly there's this totally overwhelming, powerful storm.

668
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:07,241
So nature is generally overwhelmingly powerful.

669
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:14,361
And all sorts of different things can well up, and none of them are the only one.

670
00:53:15,001 --> 00:53:19,881
And so that's now the new one is Poasis.

671
00:53:19,881 --> 00:53:26,760
That's what I'm claiming is going on in the background that Aeschylus doesn't really know because he's right in it.

672
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,920
P-O-E Poasis.

673
00:53:28,921 --> 00:53:29,881
Is that right?

674
00:53:29,881 --> 00:53:33,081
Which means cultivation.

675
00:53:33,081 --> 00:53:34,200
Yes, something's wrong.

676
00:53:34,441 --> 00:53:34,920
We're.

677
00:53:35,881 --> 00:53:37,961
Oh, I, here's an eye.

678
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:38,760
Okay.

679
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,041
Poasis.

680
00:53:40,041 --> 00:53:42,281
And so cultivation.

681
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:51,241
It's as if your understanding of being went to being a hunter-gatherer, where animals rush up and you shoot them and so forth.

682
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:59,720
And not that the people in Homer's time were hunter-gatherers, but their understanding of being was the same as if they were still hunter-gatherers.

683
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:03,320
They still had this sense of nature welling up.

684
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:08,120
And what they didn't have, though they were already cultivating things, they didn't.

685
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:23,481
And the idea was, and when I say this is their understanding of being, I mean those things are most important and most revealing about what things are that whoosh up in the Iliad.

686
00:54:23,481 --> 00:54:29,241
And afterward, now that you get to Aeschylus, it's 500 years later.

687
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:35,601
And the most important thing you can do is cultivate things, bring out the best in them.

688
00:54:30,521 --> 00:54:37,120
And that you's why I was setting it up.

689
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:40,481
You bring out the best in the Furies, and the Furies become good.

690
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,361
If you repress them, they become bad.

691
00:54:43,361 --> 00:54:53,440
It's as if Aeschylus thinks that there are two kinds of ways of organizing the world.

692
00:54:53,441 --> 00:54:59,120
What I'm going to call a repressive order, and that's the order that they had before.

693
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,680
I don't think it's Homeric.

694
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,441
I don't think it's Athenian either.

695
00:55:06,081 --> 00:55:07,681
I don't know any word for it.

696
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,720
But there is then an expressive order.

697
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,721
That's what the Athenians have.

698
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,560
That's this understanding of being a poesis.

699
00:55:16,561 --> 00:55:18,961
And all of this I'm saying to answer his question.

700
00:55:19,601 --> 00:55:22,880
Well, I'll have to say more, because I haven't explained enough poesis.

701
00:55:22,881 --> 00:55:26,401
That means for Heidegger, letting come forth.

702
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,000
I said cultivation.

703
00:55:28,001 --> 00:55:29,041
That's my word.

704
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:31,841
Heidegger is fancier talk.

705
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,521
Letting come forth.

706
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:39,120
Now, you need examples, or you won't believe it.

707
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,921
I mean, that is, what do you bring forth?

708
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:47,441
Well, plants, children, the craftsmen bring forth.

709
00:55:47,441 --> 00:55:55,200
Heidegger has a lot to say how the carpenter brings the grain out of the wood and the sculptor brings the sculpting out of the stone.

710
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,160
That's how a Greek sculptor of this period described it.

711
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,401
He was letting the sculptor come out of the stone.

712
00:56:00,401 --> 00:56:02,881
And Michelangelo, I think, said the same thing.

713
00:56:02,881 --> 00:56:05,681
That's a poesis way of thinking about it.

714
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:13,521
So, and now, let's see.

715
00:56:13,521 --> 00:56:17,881
So, when the furies are repressed and they try to impose order on them, it doesn't work.

716
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:30,360
But when the furies are officiated and brought out, then they for married love, legal cities, loyalty, patriotism, everything that's good.

717
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,240
So then things don't just well up.

718
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:37,320
You've got to sort of make a culture that brings out the best in things.

719
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:42,601
That's what Aeschylus is doing, and saying that Athena is doing.

720
00:56:42,601 --> 00:56:46,601
And I don't think Aeschylus thinks about it this way, because I think he's inside of it.

721
00:56:46,601 --> 00:56:48,521
But now back to his good question.

722
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:49,640
Who asked it?

723
00:56:50,361 --> 00:56:50,680
You.

724
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:51,160
Oh, yeah.

725
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:56,760
So I think you couldn't be really in two understandings of being at once.

726
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:01,640
I think they don't understand storms and sort of plants just popping up.

727
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,881
Everything that's important needs to be cultivated and brought out.

728
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:13,640
And the Odyssey is a wonderful, dead piece of art for them, like medieval cathedrals are for us.

729
00:57:13,961 --> 00:57:15,320
So now, yeah.

730
00:57:15,961 --> 00:57:18,120
But it's not what the Tested View.

731
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:18,601
It's what.

732
00:57:19,081 --> 00:57:19,961
Yes.

733
00:57:19,961 --> 00:57:21,001
That's right.

734
00:57:21,001 --> 00:57:21,800
That's right.

735
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,841
It's not you imposing an order on things.

736
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,920
It's you letting the order that's in the things.

737
00:57:26,921 --> 00:57:29,640
You get to let the cabinet come out of the wood.

738
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:37,640
All you do is select the wood, and as a carpenter, the wood will sort of lead you, if you're a good carpenter, to bring out the cabinet that's in it.

739
00:57:37,961 --> 00:57:41,881
We now call people like that or still around in Berkeley Zen carpenters.

740
00:57:41,881 --> 00:57:46,201
But it's a kind of craftsmanship.

741
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:53,001
And whether you let it come forth or bring it forth seem to be two stages of this.

742
00:57:53,001 --> 00:58:03,601
I mean, you can just sort of clear the way for things to express themselves fully, or you can, and that's what I think, is cultivating and nurturing.

743
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:11,841
I think that they really need, are the furies just let come forth, or are they cultivated and nurtured by Athena?

744
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:14,320
I would say they were cultivated and nurtured.

745
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:24,001
I mean, that's how she has to let them rant on and then gradually persuade them and then give them more and more sense of their own importance and they flourish.

746
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:27,760
The main thing is, when you do that, then everything flourishes.

747
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,920
That reminds me of something interesting.

748
00:58:29,921 --> 00:58:36,880
That I don't know if I can just find it, but Pericles has written.

749
00:58:36,881 --> 00:58:38,160
Let's try this.

750
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:46,241
We do not feel angry with our neighbor for doing what he likes, or even to indulge in those injurious looks, which cannot fail to be offensive.

751
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:51,120
But all this ease in our private relations doesn't make us lawless citizens.

752
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:57,920
No, there's some place where he says everybody can do what they please, in effect.

753
00:58:58,561 --> 00:59:00,001
Let's try this.

754
00:59:00,561 --> 00:59:12,560
We are the schools of all of Hellas, and I doubt if the world can produce a man who, where he has only himself to depend on, is equal to our versatility.

755
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,761
No, I can't find it.

756
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:24,881
It amounts to saying that everybody can do whatever he pleases in Athens, and it all works out for the best.

757
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,601
That's the hope of this kind of expressive order.

758
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:33,681
Athens is set up to let everybody flourish in their own way.

759
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,680
That's what Pericles says.

760
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,681
That's what Aeschylus thinks.

761
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,280
Yeah, did I see a hand over here?

762
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,120
Do you want to talk for 15 minutes?

763
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,480
Okay.

764
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,360
So that's one question.

765
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:54,680
And you said that this is the mother of all works of art because it goes out of its own time and self-referential and waiting for the West.

766
00:59:55,001 --> 00:59:55,880
I think she's right.

767
00:59:55,881 --> 00:59:58,200
And in a way, the Odyssey is also self-referential.

768
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,760
I thought you were going to say something different, but it doesn't go against it.

769
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,681
And Homer puts himself into it.

770
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:17,001
The harper is there singing the thing that he's doing, which produces their sense of the marvelous, shining character of their Fusis hero culture.

771
01:00:17,001 --> 01:00:18,361
I think that's right.

772
01:00:18,361 --> 01:00:19,481
That's good.

773
01:00:21,961 --> 01:00:24,200
Maybe every work of art is self-referential.

774
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:24,840
I don't know.

775
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:33,481
It'd be interesting if the cathedrals put into the stained glass windows the pictures of the workers making the windows and so forth.

776
01:00:33,481 --> 01:00:37,481
I don't know whether that's important or not that they do that.

777
01:00:37,481 --> 01:00:40,760
But I think we should, I don't want to stop the conversation.

778
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,521
I just don't have more to say about it yet.

779
01:00:42,521 --> 01:00:44,521
I think you will sort of get more and more as we get.

780
01:00:44,601 --> 01:00:46,361
No, okay, let's go on.

781
01:00:46,361 --> 01:00:47,160
Yeah.

782
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:50,840
And Odyssey, there's no one thing.

783
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:54,040
That's part of the pluralism of the Odyssey.

784
01:00:54,041 --> 01:00:59,081
There are kings who do their king thing and swinehards who do their thing.

785
01:00:59,081 --> 01:01:01,240
There isn't any city.

786
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,720
There are all these little kingdoms on various islands.

787
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:11,321
Argos has got its island, and I think the who do they go visit by boat at the very beginning?

788
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,401
Menelaus is on his island.

789
01:01:13,401 --> 01:01:15,561
So there's no unified city.

790
01:01:15,561 --> 01:01:18,200
There's certainly no democracy.

791
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:24,201
No notion of patriotism, what it could be to be patriotism when there are all these different kings on all these different islands.

792
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:30,561
But that's just typical of what with a multiple number of little kingdoms.

793
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:32,880
Cities is something invented later.

794
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:37,360
Yeah, a multipleness of kingdoms and a multipleness of lifestyles.

795
01:01:37,521 --> 01:01:38,081
Right.

796
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:49,921
And all of them, in some sense or other, welling up, not being nourished or cultivated, but somehow just popping up when they do.

797
01:01:49,921 --> 01:01:52,480
It's hard to explain how a kingdom does that.

798
01:01:52,481 --> 01:01:53,360
But yeah.

799
01:01:55,921 --> 01:01:59,520
Between Homer and the Oristea.

800
01:01:59,521 --> 01:02:15,200
It seems that in Homer, the Odyssey itself, there is the difference made between civilization and nature because it makes you that the lifelong civilized.

801
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:28,801
So there is a big difference in the Odyssey between what Beatrice is saying, the really whooshing up most nature person, Poseidon and the storms, but the heroes whoosh up and the gods whoosh up too.

802
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:35,601
And I think, what else did you say?

803
01:02:35,601 --> 01:02:35,920
Have I?

804
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:37,601
Oh, yeah, nature.

805
01:02:37,601 --> 01:02:38,640
You and culture.

806
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:44,640
Yeah, now what is happening in a culture of which is a truce culture?

807
01:02:46,561 --> 01:02:48,640
Well, I don't think so.

808
01:02:48,961 --> 01:02:50,001
Let's take the culture.

809
01:02:50,001 --> 01:02:55,041
Civilization is more, I think, already sort of unified and socialized.

810
01:02:55,041 --> 01:02:58,160
But there are practices, and they all do speak Greek.

811
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:01,921
There is some, and they have the same bunch of gods.

812
01:03:01,921 --> 01:03:09,120
And they have the same sensibility, I think, that they're not in the nurturing and cultivating business.

813
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:13,240
But take the way Aphrodite sort of whooshes up and runs off with Helen.

814
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:14,160
Moods whoosh up.

815
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,960
And moods, yeah, that's the missing link.

816
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:25,640
If moods are so important, as I claim they are in the Odyssey, and moods just take you over, you can't bring them on and you can't turn them off and you can't cultivate them either.

817
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:32,680
I don't think you just get carried away, then you can see how the understanding of being and the importance of moods fit together.

818
01:03:33,001 --> 01:03:34,360
That's helpful.

819
01:03:34,601 --> 01:03:35,640
Did you want to say something?

820
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:36,840
I thought I saw a handbag.

821
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:37,720
No?

822
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:39,880
Yo, good.

823
01:03:39,881 --> 01:03:40,761
Go ahead.

824
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:41,400
Wait, I can't.

825
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,081
There's echo you put in the room.

826
01:03:43,081 --> 01:03:44,280
I can see why you can't tell me.

827
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,160
I can't hear you either.

828
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:49,001
And you are saying what I do on the honest moods.

829
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,840
Ah, good, good.

830
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:51,320
I don't know.

831
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:52,441
You asked a little question.

832
01:03:52,521 --> 01:03:53,721
I have to think about it.

833
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,721
What about moods?

834
01:03:55,720 --> 01:04:05,080
Moods, to begin with, there are good moods and bad moods, repressed moods, like the periods and hate and all that, and good moods.

835
01:04:05,081 --> 01:04:08,841
And the good moods are the ones that get cultivated in the course of the book.

836
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:14,361
And the bad moods get turned into good moods as far as possible by being cultivated.

837
01:04:14,361 --> 01:04:16,921
And that's what you expect.

838
01:04:16,921 --> 01:04:20,120
So it isn't that moods cease to be important.

839
01:04:20,441 --> 01:04:22,681
It's that that's interesting.

840
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:23,800
I'm out on a limb.

841
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:33,160
I don't know whether I'll believe this tomorrow, but it looks like how the culture treats moods is going to be an expression of their understanding of being.

842
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:40,281
So the Homer ones just accept the fact that whoosh, there's Aphrodite and off goes Helen.

843
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:42,280
Or that whoosh, there's Achilles.

844
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:47,720
He finally decides to fight in the elevator and he rushes out and kills hundreds of people in an afternoon.

845
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:54,840
It isn't as if there's a thought that if you don't nourish moods, they'll become bad.

846
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,840
And if you do nourish moods, they'll become good.

847
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,920
That's just not a thought of the Odyssey.

848
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,481
Moods don't get transformed.

849
01:05:00,201 --> 01:05:05,040
They're just bad ones, and they're good ones, and you just get grabbed by the ones that come along.

850
01:05:05,361 --> 01:05:23,840
But the attitude towards moods is, or emotions we're now calling them, which are related to the moods of hate, of vengeance, of patriotism, and so forth, is that they, that they well up isn't interesting to them.

851
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:29,840
It's that, if you repress them, they become bad, and if you nourish them, they become good.

852
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:30,561
Yeah.

853
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:31,441
Yeah.

854
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:34,080
Ah, no, good question.

855
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:34,640
No.

856
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:38,481
I mean, the polyness is gone in the Oristea.

857
01:05:38,481 --> 01:05:41,040
It's a big step toward monotheism.

858
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:43,680
The first step is a bad step.

859
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:48,401
Remember, I said it was sort of multiple, double, dual monotheism.

860
01:05:48,401 --> 01:05:58,320
I never used those terms, but I mean, each of the two forces, the Apollo forces, the new gods' forces, and the old gods, Fury's forces, each say they're the whole answer.

861
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:08,240
Nobody goes around in the Odyssey or Iliad saying, our way of understanding things, I'm the only God that really counts, or the only kind of God that really counts.

862
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:12,481
So in that sense, it's turning toward more mono.

863
01:06:12,481 --> 01:06:27,120
But then it gets really mono, if you think about it this way, when the final emotion is patriotism for Athens, and the final sort of one good thing that everything else serves, so to speak.

864
01:06:27,121 --> 01:06:37,441
However you, whatever you do, it ought to be an expression of your love of Athens, is making a much more mono-story.

865
01:06:37,441 --> 01:06:43,200
There is the right mood, namely patriotism, and all the other moods have got to get in step with it.

866
01:06:43,201 --> 01:06:47,800
Namely, the furies have to become kindly ones, and Apollo just gets knocked off the scene.

867
01:06:45,281 --> 01:06:49,720
We don't hear anything about Apollo.

868
01:06:50,521 --> 01:06:53,160
But okay, so that's a good question.

869
01:06:53,161 --> 01:06:56,760
So you handle the moods differently when you're getting past those.

870
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:57,160
Yeah.

871
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:02,361
Ah.

872
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:03,800
Good, good.

873
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:11,000
That's how it looks to us, because our understanding is the being is control, and everything ought to be controlled.

874
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,800
And so that's what subjects in talk like Descartes ought to be able to control objects.

875
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:19,160
Science ought to get the whole of nature under control.

876
01:07:19,161 --> 01:07:22,040
That's not how it seems to them.

877
01:07:22,361 --> 01:07:26,680
Say what you just said again, because that's right.

878
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,040
Yes, that's right.

879
01:07:28,281 --> 01:07:30,361
That's part of the feel of whooshing up.

880
01:07:30,361 --> 01:07:33,720
And that is just what it is to be a still primitive culture.

881
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,401
They don't understand these forces.

882
01:07:35,401 --> 01:07:42,360
They don't have an idea that if they had a better science, they could predict and control all of this.

883
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:56,920
This is what nature is like, I take it, when you don't have any science, things are just whooshing up surprisingly, and sometimes you manage to cope with them, and sometimes they draw you in and destroy you, Heidegger says.

884
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:00,840
That's part of what the overwhelming, did I write overwhelming up there?

885
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:01,481
Welling up.

886
01:08:01,481 --> 01:08:07,240
No, one of the versions of welling up is they can just be overwhelming.

887
01:08:07,241 --> 01:08:09,481
And there's nothing to do about it.

888
01:08:09,481 --> 01:08:11,000
That's one of the questions anything.

889
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,521
It wouldn't help to be smarter.

890
01:08:13,161 --> 01:08:14,281
It isn't your fault.

891
01:08:14,281 --> 01:08:16,040
It's just the way nature is.

892
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:21,401
Sometimes it helps, and sometimes it destroys you, and it's out of your control.

893
01:08:21,561 --> 01:08:25,160
That's how the world must have looked to the Homeric Greeks.

894
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,481
But they weren't scared of it.

895
01:08:27,481 --> 01:08:31,601
I mean, Heidegger thinks in reading the texts, you feel it in Homer.

896
01:08:30,441 --> 01:08:36,481
It filled them with joy and wonder that it was full of surprises and out of control.

897
01:08:37,281 --> 01:08:42,481
They were just sort of thought it was wonderful, the delightful.

898
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,240
That's too minimum, wonderful.

899
01:08:44,401 --> 01:08:46,880
Thalmazoin, what's the Greek word for that?

900
01:08:47,201 --> 01:08:49,040
Yeah, that's the Greek word for wonder.

901
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:56,240
Wonder was their basic way of experiencing the fusis going on.

902
01:08:56,241 --> 01:09:06,160
And that's very different than trying to cultivate it and domesticate it, like the Athenians were doing, according to Aeschylus.

903
01:09:06,161 --> 01:09:11,120
And it's very different from what the Romans were doing.

904
01:09:11,121 --> 01:09:13,601
Now, I just got to where I want to do.

905
01:09:13,601 --> 01:09:17,760
Beatrice is going to talk next time about Virgil.

906
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,760
But ask yourself this question.

907
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:25,040
I'm certainly not going to tell you now, not only because there isn't time, but because I think you should keep your eyes open.

908
01:09:25,201 --> 01:09:28,880
There's a whole new understanding of being in Virgil.

909
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,880
The Romans have.

910
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,800
It isn't fusis, and it isn't Poesis.

911
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,080
It's something else.

912
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:40,000
It's something closer to us than either of those.

913
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,080
And keep your eyes open for it.

914
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,360
I'll give you a hint.

915
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,960
Since Virgil, of course, doesn't understand it, because you never understand the one you're in.

916
01:09:49,201 --> 01:09:50,800
You're too much in it.

917
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:55,760
Heidegger talks about the necessary blindness of people making a work of art.

918
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,521
They can't look at the deed.

919
01:09:57,521 --> 01:09:58,640
They don't see.

920
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:03,601
Homer doesn't see that he's doing his facesis thing in the Iliad.

921
01:10:03,601 --> 01:10:08,401
And uh Aeschylus doesn't see that he's got a Poesis order.

922
01:10:08,401 --> 01:10:11,760
Anyway, so look w uh, where would you look?

923
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:15,880
Well, in in the Iliad, in the Aeneid anyway, look at the metaphors.

924
01:10:15,361 --> 01:10:20,760
There's certain or similes it's called that like something, something, something, something, something.

925
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,200
When Virgil starts that, keep your eyes open.

926
01:10:24,201 --> 01:10:32,601
There are some very interesting similes that ex that express exactly their understanding of being.

927
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:33,401
Okay.
