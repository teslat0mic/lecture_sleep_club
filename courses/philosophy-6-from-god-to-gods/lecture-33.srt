1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,881
Okay, so the next thing is: I was trying, and this is closer to relevant now, this is about Moby Dick.

2
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:12,001
I've been thinking about the claim that moods are so important to Melville.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:33,681
And I've given you examples now and then of Ishmael's moods and how he gets into every mood, from Ahab's mood to the only moods he doesn't get into is, say, Starbucks' mood, which is a Christian mood because he can't get in sync with anything monotheistic, but otherwise he can.

4
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:36,160
And I discovered a quote.

5
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,481
I mean, it doesn't seem to me much out of context, but I don't think it has much context.

6
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,440
And I think in a way, it means a lot.

7
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:54,881
On 475, at the beginning of the first paragraph, he talks about the moody Pequot.

8
00:00:54,881 --> 00:00:56,560
The boat is moody.

9
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,321
They're all moody, in other words.

10
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:07,081
And he says, as this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequad, there were sounds of drums.

11
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:12,120
This is the bachelor that's caught a lot of whales and everybody's in a very good mood.

12
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:17,320
And another one, he talks about the various moods of Ahab.

13
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:33,160
And on 118, the end of the middle paragraph, he says, and not only that, but moody, stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face and so forth and so forth.

14
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:38,440
So the Pequad is moody, Ahab is moody, and of course Ishmael is moody.

15
00:01:38,441 --> 00:01:42,201
I've been saying that, but I found another quote that says that.

16
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:48,441
It was just another place where he shifts his mood in such a funny way.

17
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,881
He's worried about the Elijah's prediction.

18
00:01:51,881 --> 00:01:56,920
Elijah's the prophet that sort of warns him he shouldn't go on this mission.

19
00:01:57,401 --> 00:02:11,401
And he says, so he talks about ragged, about ten lines down, ragged Elijah's diabolical incoherencies uninvitedly recurred to me with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived of.

20
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:23,561
But poorly could I stand, could I withstand them, such as in other moods, I was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicality of that outlandish prophet.

21
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:31,961
Just typical of him to be in a mood right there of worrying about the prophecy of what's going to happen to them on the boat.

22
00:02:31,961 --> 00:02:37,561
But he's in other situations, he finds them funny and he smiles at them.

23
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:40,761
And that's because he's in every conceivable mood at some point.

24
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,280
Yeah, I'm going to say something.

25
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:49,401
Okay, we're in now in chapter I wanna I don't wanna go back, but I'll we're in chapter 28.

26
00:02:49,600 --> 00:03:05,120
And if you I'll try to say the chapter each time, but I don't really keep track of the chapters because there's about five different versions running around, and I just can't do more than how many finally have the this copy of it, the one I have.

27
00:03:05,121 --> 00:03:07,040
Well, that's encouraging.

28
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,641
Are there still is there still anybody who hasn't found a copy?

29
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:18,321
I take it the bookstore did their job and every nobody, good, maybe a little late not to have a copy, I would despair for you.

30
00:03:18,321 --> 00:03:19,360
But here we go.

31
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay, so those are just mood things.

32
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:27,040
Now I'm going back to the main line of the lecture.

33
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:40,160
And I'm sort of picking up pieces, all of which I need, before I can really talk about the chase at the end, which is lucky for everybody, because I wonder how many have gotten to the end now.

34
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,761
Uh-huh, okay.

35
00:03:41,761 --> 00:03:43,281
Well, I will do, it's up to you.

36
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,081
If you don't want to get, if you don't want to hear the ending, all you have to do is keep asking me questions.

37
00:03:48,081 --> 00:03:54,001
And because I think I will get to the end if you don't, but I may not.

38
00:03:54,001 --> 00:04:10,880
I've put in before getting to the end just because I figured I ought to be able to stall one more lecture that I think I may be able, just by filling in all the background things you need to know before you can really appreciate the whole end event.

39
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:13,201
Maybe we won't get to the end this time.

40
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:22,000
But this is definitely your last chance because I can't possibly not get to the end next time since I intend to finish the book next time.

41
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:48,521
Okay, but let's, I'm going to review reactions to perspectival whiteness, to the fact that all in in, in, that everything can have lots of interpretations, perspectives equal interpretations, and that when you add up all the interpretations, they don't add up to some right interpretation or better interpretation.

42
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,160
They just cancel each other out.

43
00:04:51,160 --> 00:05:12,120
It's really interesting to me, and I'll probably come back to it next time, that Nietzsche, who is so close to Moby Dick, to Melville, isn't as radical in his talk about interpretations as Melville, though Nietzsche's writing a whole generation later.

44
00:05:12,121 --> 00:05:24,441
I discovered in, I was looking for quotes, I'm going to give you a handout next time of about six quotes from Nietzsche, which are very, very close to Melville, but in each case, Melville gets it righter.

45
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,280
I like Nietzsche, but I must say, Melville's deeper.

46
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:35,321
But you'll see when I hand out a Nietzsche quote that for Nietzsche, the interpretations don't add up.

47
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:37,561
That would be really old-fashioned.

48
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,160
I mean, for Dante, the interpretations add up when you go around a house and you see more and more.

49
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:49,241
Then you finally get it right about the house, and that's obviously the right interpretation.

50
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:50,681
Ah, it's a house.

51
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,361
But then there's a middle view.

52
00:05:52,361 --> 00:06:00,121
Nietzsche says everything is interpretations, but the more interpretations, the better, the more objectivity.

53
00:06:00,121 --> 00:06:06,040
As if somehow the interpretations are all pointing in the same direction, anyway.

54
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:11,641
But it looks like, but what Melville sees is these interpretations point in opposite directions.

55
00:06:11,641 --> 00:06:13,881
That's what we're going to talk about a lot today.

56
00:06:15,481 --> 00:06:29,841
There are interpretations of Moby Dick, and the more you get, the less you have any unified picture of the meaning of Mobidech or the meaning of the universe, which are pretty much equated in the book.

57
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:34,961
Okay, so now I'm going to go through some of these interpretations.

58
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:38,961
But first, just perspectives on whiteness.

59
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:47,201
How do they deal with the fact that everything seems to be interpretation and they don't add up?

60
00:06:47,200 --> 00:07:09,921
Well, one possibility is, and I haven't talked enough about this guy, so I'm going to spend a little time on Starbuck because he is the old-fashioned Christian response, but not bad because he's hypocritical or selfish, like Bildad.

61
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,401
And I never can remember the name of the other one.

62
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:13,441
What's this?

63
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,960
Oh, well, somebody knows.

64
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,841
The two guys that signed them up for the boat.

65
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:18,881
Peleg or something.

66
00:07:18,881 --> 00:07:20,001
Yeah, Peleg and Bildad.

67
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,680
Anyway, they are really bad.

68
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:36,081
And they turn Twique against Christianity just observing how they're citing Bible passages while getting people as cheaply as possible to sign on.

69
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,081
But that's, we want to see a Christian at his best, so to speak.

70
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,041
And Starbuck is just that exactly.

71
00:07:43,040 --> 00:08:03,200
And on 97, well, by the way, Father Mapple is a kind of radical Christian in this in his Kierkegaardian sense that there isn't any relation to God and you're swimming over water, but you can commit yourself to something anyway, the way Jonah did.

72
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,521
You can have a calling.

73
00:08:04,081 --> 00:08:09,240
That's an even better kind of Christianity than Starbucks.

74
00:08:09,481 --> 00:08:20,521
But that's such a special thing, and Melville obviously finds it, I don't know, fascinating, but he just doesn't get it or doesn't buy it, though he invented it.

75
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:23,481
He beat Kierkegaard by a year or two, I think.

76
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:25,720
But anyway, so I'm not talking about him.

77
00:08:25,721 --> 00:08:27,800
I'm talking about a normal sort of Christian.

78
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,681
Starbuck is the best sort of normal Christian.

79
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:36,040
He is on the top of 97, which is the end of chapter 21.

80
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,041
When I know it, I will tell you.

81
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,841
And there we hear about Starbuck.

82
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:44,841
He's a lively cheap mate, that good man and pious.

83
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,001
And that's enough to get now.

84
00:08:49,241 --> 00:08:53,321
But now we have to understand more what it is to be a good man and pious.

85
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:59,641
Well, to begin with, you should realize, of course, that this is always something you can keep your eye open for.

86
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:05,081
People from Nantucket are always people who want to turn the sea into the land.

87
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:14,041
Remember, that's the thing that people in Nantucket managed to do, that they made it into a highway for whale chasing.

88
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:22,921
And so on the beginning of chapter 26, the chief mate of the Pea Quad was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket and a Quaker by descent.

89
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,961
That is, that's his Christian and onso-theological.

90
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:34,521
That is, there's one right answer, it's the truth for all time and for everybody way of looking at things.

91
00:09:34,521 --> 00:09:35,881
And he's a good guy.

92
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,081
He was a long, earnest man, and so forth and so forth.

93
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,561
And at the bottom of that same page, about five lines from the bottom, a staid, steadfast man.

94
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:53,680
In other words, a good guy, a really sort of responsible, good person.

95
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,440
But he's weak.

96
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,841
He can't stand up to Ahab.

97
00:09:57,841 --> 00:10:03,521
He can't even, he doesn't know how to deal with this kind of monomania of Ahabs.

98
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:08,881
He's got a kind of almost peaceful assurance that Christianity is all right.

99
00:10:08,881 --> 00:10:15,441
I say almost because in the Doubloon scene, he sees the Trinity, but he turns away from the Debloon.

100
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:22,801
He says, I shouldn't look at this too long in case it tempts me to not fully believe in it.

101
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,601
And so he sees that, you know, but he doesn't want to.

102
00:10:25,761 --> 00:10:29,201
He won't let himself have any doubts.

103
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:39,761
And when Starbucks around, it's interesting, the sea even sort of starts to look like the land on 473.

104
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,721
That's chapter 114.

105
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:49,041
It's 472, the third paragraph in chapter 114.

106
00:10:50,641 --> 00:11:02,881
There are times when in his whale boat, the rover softly feels a certain filial, confident, land-like feeling towards the sea that he regards as so much flowery earth.

107
00:11:02,881 --> 00:11:12,721
And the distant ship struggling forward through the waves looks like it's coming through the grass or the prairie and so forth and so forth.

108
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:22,721
And he's talking about, I think, something in connection with Starbucks, or else I have missed what I'm trying to say.

109
00:11:22,721 --> 00:11:27,201
No, there's Starbucks at the bottom of 473, the next page.

110
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,601
Loveliness, he says, loveliness unfathomable as ever lover saw in his young bride's eye.

111
00:11:33,601 --> 00:11:39,961
He says to the sea, tell me not of thy teeth-teared sharks and thy kidnapping cannibal ways.

112
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,841
Let faith out fact, let fancy oust memory.

113
00:11:44,841 --> 00:11:47,481
I look deep down and do believe.

114
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:56,921
So he's a believer, in spite of the evidence of all the other possible moods of the sea and all the other interpretations.

115
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:03,321
And that's why he just doesn't understand and can't stand up to Ahab.

116
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:09,641
That's on 180, which is the end of chapter 41.

117
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:24,361
Here then was this gray-headed, ungodly old man chasing with curses a Job's way around the world at the head of a crew to cheaply made up of mongrel renegades and castaways and cannibals.

118
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:33,721
And now the crucial sentence, morally enfeebled also by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in Starbuck.

119
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:53,241
And so when Starbuck has a chance to kill Ahab, when he realizes that Ahab's going to kill them all if he goes on like this, running around literally all over the world globe, chasing Moby Dick when he's supposed to be getting whales and bringing them home, then he, but he can't do it.

120
00:12:53,241 --> 00:13:02,361
He just hasn't got, he's just a good Christian, and you don't go around shooting people just because they're out of control and dangerous.

121
00:13:02,361 --> 00:13:06,120
Now, okay, another thing, remember what I'm doing now.

122
00:13:06,121 --> 00:13:09,800
I'm listing four reactions to the whiteness.

123
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:18,841
The the fact that, in fact, you can't get any solid interpretation that isn't counteracted by some other.

124
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:35,041
And the and I've said one is even the best sort of Christians like Starbuck have this denial of the fact that it has the the whole world has no one color, no one meaning.

125
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:44,001
And philosophy, I've mentioned once or twice, Melville doesn't like philosophy, but I thought I owe you a quote or two.

126
00:13:44,001 --> 00:13:53,521
I mean, of course he won't like philosophy because he doesn't like any view that thinks it's got the one right answer.

127
00:13:53,521 --> 00:14:04,961
And of course not every philosopher is like that, but the great philosophers, the ones he sort of doesn't like, did each one think that finally with me, each one says we've got it.

128
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,081
And Melville's reaction to that is just to laugh at them.

129
00:14:10,401 --> 00:14:24,320
That is, so Plato, he doesn't like, who is the original source of the notion that there is one truth, that that truth is divine, and to know that truth is a saving thing.

130
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,641
And all the story of the Republic.

131
00:14:26,641 --> 00:14:27,760
How many know the Republic?

132
00:14:28,081 --> 00:14:32,960
A lot of you know maybe, well, sooner or later you'll come across it.

133
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:37,760
And then, so that's on 334.

134
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:48,240
He's making fun of Plato and this happy picture that Plato presents of everything making perfect sense, if you only understand it and get in the right relation to it.

135
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,280
This is the very end of chapter 78.

136
00:14:51,281 --> 00:15:01,680
He talks about how somebody, the risk of falling into the head of the whale while you're scooping out the spermaceti, which is all perfume-like.

137
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:07,881
And he says, How many think ye have likewise fallen into Plato's honeyhead and sweetly perished there?

138
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,601
So there go the Platonists.

139
00:15:10,601 --> 00:15:16,200
Aristotle comes off equally badly on 459.

140
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:23,641
That's the first paragraph of chapter 110.

141
00:15:24,281 --> 00:15:28,121
Top, this is when the whale gets hoisted up on the side of the ship.

142
00:15:28,121 --> 00:15:33,720
Top heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all Aristotle in his head.

143
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,641
That's all Aristotle gets for interest.

144
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:48,841
And then Locke and Kant get brushed off in a hurry on 118 for a book that is so philosophical and which is so knowledgeable.

145
00:15:48,841 --> 00:15:57,240
Although he never went to college, he seems to have read everything that a well-informed person should read and more.

146
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,080
He really just doesn't take the philosopher seriously at all.

147
00:16:01,081 --> 00:16:08,840
And now on page 118, hmm, I am wrong.

148
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,720
I don't see, I've mismarked it.

149
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,601
I don't see anything about Kant and Locke on page 118.

150
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,440
I wonder what I did wrong.

151
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,561
I copied it wrong.

152
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:23,081
Anyway, there's a place where he dismisses Kant and Locke.

153
00:16:23,081 --> 00:16:24,121
I owe it to you.

154
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,520
I'll get it by next time.

155
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,641
So, and it's funny to put Kant and Locke together like that.

156
00:16:29,641 --> 00:16:30,680
It's dismiss them.

157
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:39,560
I mean, he certainly didn't take, say, 25B, where those are the opposed, very opposed positions.

158
00:16:39,561 --> 00:16:41,081
Okay, so onward.

159
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:52,960
So, philosophy and Christianity, even at its best, are both onto theology, meaning they think that there's a supreme being that explains everything.

160
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,160
And if you believe in that, you don't face the whiteness.

161
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:16,000
So, then there are those, and I'm just reviewing, who affirm the whiteness, who stand in the infinite and the indefinite, and can't stand the illusion that there's any answer at all.

162
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,361
Who is that?

163
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:20,480
Baltington, somebody said, right?

164
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,201
Who said that?

165
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,760
You?

166
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,321
Okay.

167
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:34,080
Yes, of course, that's Baltington standing there, not wanting to spend a minute on the land, ready to hang out in the total open.

168
00:17:34,081 --> 00:17:54,641
I thought again today as I was looking back at Nietzsche, the interesting difference that Nietzsche has his notion of a free spirit over man who can face up to what Nietzsche calls the death of God, which is like the whiteness of the whale, but there's no onto theological right answer.

169
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:58,720
And Nietzsche says that this is a very attractive view.

170
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,920
I'll give you that in the quotes I hand out, because such a person will be joyous.

171
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:12,000
It tells the name of the book that I'm going to get these from is the joyful wisdom, sometimes translated the gay science.

172
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,601
Well, Melville, remembers, main objection to Baltington is that Baltington is grim.

173
00:18:17,601 --> 00:18:19,200
He's not happy.

174
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:33,280
He hasn't, you can't just be what Heidegger calls the lieutenant of nothingness, which standing out into the nothing and be joyful about it, Melville thinks.

175
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:38,281
So he sees this as a possible position, but he doesn't see it as a position that he wants to hold.

176
00:18:38,601 --> 00:18:49,960
And in a way, maybe it's not even livable for Melville because Balkington gets bunked off by the end of that paragraph where he's godlike, but he can't live in this world.

177
00:18:50,281 --> 00:19:02,280
And then another reaction, now we've got two: the onto theology and the standing in the indefinite, and then you could go mad.

178
00:19:02,281 --> 00:19:04,441
I mean, Balkington is sort of willful.

179
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:12,521
He's pushing himself out into this total, bottomless, ocean water world.

180
00:19:12,841 --> 00:19:31,800
Then there's Pip, who actually got to the bottom of the oceanless, the ocean, bottomless water world, and saw the God's foot on the loom and saw these coral insects that were making the orbs and so forth.

181
00:19:31,801 --> 00:19:39,800
And Pip's response is to go crazy, to lose his identity completely and to lose everything.

182
00:19:39,801 --> 00:19:41,881
And that's another possibility.

183
00:19:42,121 --> 00:19:45,480
Balkington is willful and strong.

184
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,800
Pip is receptive and in a certain sense, weak.

185
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,720
But, and this is a quote about Pip that I didn't read when I talked about Pip, so I'm going to read it now.

186
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,960
On page 515, it's the end of chapter 27.

187
00:20:00,281 --> 00:20:04,121
He's saying, oh, they had in the peak, what's he, where was, where am I?

188
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,000
Black little Pip, he never did come back.

189
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,561
That is.

190
00:20:09,561 --> 00:20:11,320
Oh, no, he went before.

191
00:20:11,321 --> 00:20:13,241
That is, he's dead.

192
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,520
Whatever happens to the rest of the crew, Pip is gone already.

193
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,840
He went before.

194
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:24,240
On the grim Peak Quad's forecastle, you shall ere long see him beating his tambourine, perlusive of the eternal time.

195
00:20:24,801 --> 00:20:38,881
This is all weird Melville talk, but perlusive of the eternal time when sent for to the great quarter deck on high, he was bid to strike in with the angels and beat his tambourine in glory, call the tower here, hail the hero there.

196
00:20:38,881 --> 00:21:13,361
Well, of course you don't take that literally, but what it means is something like he has at least the ability to be open to the way reality is, and though it blows his mind completely, instead of thinking of him as sort of pathetic as everybody else does, the right view, the view of the angels, will be that he's gone in the right direction as far as you could go.

197
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:29,601
Namely, not willfulness, but where you impose your own idea on the universe, or stand up to the non-meaning of the universe, but where you're open to whatever it is that's really going on.

198
00:21:30,641 --> 00:21:33,760
So Pip is a kind of funny hero.

199
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,521
And then comes number four, which is a special case, I think.

200
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:48,401
It's not like philosophy, Christianity on the one hand, or heroic nihilism, which is Balkington, or sort of receptive nihilism, which is Pip.

201
00:21:48,401 --> 00:21:53,200
There is this willful force and answer from the universe.

202
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,121
That's, of course, whose job, who wants to strike through the mask.

203
00:21:58,121 --> 00:22:00,160
Everybody knows, I hope.

204
00:22:00,801 --> 00:22:04,361
Ahab, one person says, this is sort of eerie.

205
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,281
But anyway, yeah, Ahab.

206
00:22:06,841 --> 00:22:14,121
So, but Ahab, and now comes a quote I don't understand.

207
00:22:14,121 --> 00:22:20,840
So I, in the hopes that somebody will, although it's very hard, I think, but probably very important.

208
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:35,560
A quote about Ahab and his relation to the whiteness, to the blankness, and to his determination to find an interpretation on page 195, the end of chapter 44.

209
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:43,401
There's something, lots of Melville is pretty strange, but here's what, and sometimes I could decode it, but this is, I haven't decoded this one.

210
00:22:43,401 --> 00:22:49,641
About 15 lines from the bottom of one of that book, of that chapter 44.

211
00:22:50,440 --> 00:23:17,320
Therefore, the tormented spirit that glared out of the bodily eyes when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room, it was Ahab, was from the time, was for the time but a vacated thing, a formless funabulistic being, a ray of living light to be sure, but without any object to color, and therefore a blankness in itself.

212
00:23:17,321 --> 00:23:19,080
That is a mouthful.

213
00:23:19,081 --> 00:23:21,881
What in the world is he trying to say?

214
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:36,760
My stab at it is something like: by trying to force one final answer on the universe, somehow Ahab gets blankness.

215
00:23:37,401 --> 00:23:42,440
You get blankness if you try to embrace all the interpretations.

216
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:51,440
You get blankness if you try to fit it all into one interpretation, I think, though I don't understand exactly how it's supposed to work.

217
00:23:51,440 --> 00:24:02,401
If anybody understands why he, when he's really in his most monomaniac state, becomes, and see the right words are in there.

218
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:09,521
He becomes something without an object of color, a blankness in itself.

219
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:22,401
He seems to confront whiteness and become whiteness at the end of his most extreme craziness when he's trying to impose a meaning, but he can't, yeah.

220
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:26,561
I mean, I can't, if anybody has anything better to say, come and tell me in office hours.

221
00:24:26,561 --> 00:24:27,601
I just don't know.

222
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:28,320
You got something to say?

223
00:24:28,321 --> 00:24:30,800
You look like you might have something to say to that way.

224
00:24:30,801 --> 00:24:32,641
Okay, well, that's encouraging.

225
00:24:32,641 --> 00:24:35,520
I mean, I think that that might be what it says.

226
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,601
Two people thinking that might be what it says is some comfort.

227
00:24:39,601 --> 00:24:47,601
Okay, now, so much for the people out to get Moby Dick in their various ways.

228
00:24:47,841 --> 00:24:49,121
Well, no, that's not fair.

229
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:50,160
So, never mind.

230
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,000
So much for all the views about whiteness that are running around.

231
00:24:54,641 --> 00:25:00,000
We now, I mean, the people out to get Moby Dick is really only Ahab.

232
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,320
And so I'm not ready to talk about Chase yet.

233
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,280
I mean, Ahab's the one who wants an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation with Moby Dick.

234
00:25:09,281 --> 00:25:22,000
He wants an answer about the meaning of everything, and he somehow, in his crazy way, thinks that if he gets this, gets in fronting Moby Dick, he'll find out.

235
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,201
What will he find out?

236
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:35,241
Well, he'll find out whether the universe, which is sort of personified in Moby Dick, is malevolent, is moral, is indifferent, and so forth.

237
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:43,401
And that's what the chase should reveal at the end of the book, where you aren't yet, so I'm not going to get there yet, maybe.

238
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:48,121
But I have, because I want to say more about Moby Dick.

239
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,601
And I haven't said it enough and hadn't said it right.

240
00:25:52,601 --> 00:26:08,680
But, of course, Moby Dick is tied up with the sea, the ocean, and the ocean is boundless and bottomless and indefinite as God, which is just indefinite, totally indefinite.

241
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:14,440
And Moby Dick is kind of, the sperm whale is the king of the boundless sea.

242
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,641
Isn't that what it's called?

243
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:17,641
That song at the beginning?

244
00:26:17,641 --> 00:26:22,601
Where a giant in might, where might is right, and king of the boundless sea.

245
00:26:22,601 --> 00:26:24,280
That's the sperm whale.

246
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,520
That's the last of those weird extracts.

247
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,320
And Moby Dick is also white.

248
00:26:31,321 --> 00:26:36,361
So that means a dumb blankness full of meaning.

249
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:43,961
And sort of, but what, if there was one sort of word for Moby Dick and the sea, we have to have a word for them.

250
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,401
What would we say about them?

251
00:26:45,401 --> 00:26:50,601
I mean, I've said in just in passing every once in a while, they're unrepresentable.

252
00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:53,000
That is, they're ungraspable.

253
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:58,840
That is, you can't state what they mean.

254
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:12,441
And it's as if Moby Dick keeps open the fact that there's something very sort of big and important which is unrepresentable.

255
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:23,680
Remember, I go back to the very first lecture on Moby Dick and to the picture in the Spouder Inn, where it's almost impossible to tell what it's a picture of, and then it turns out to be a picture of the sperm whale.

256
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,041
But then you get all this about the whale has no face, its tail makes gestures, but you can't read them.

257
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:31,680
It's covered with hieroglyphics and you can't read them.

258
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:41,440
And if you try to get him out of the whale, out of the water, it loses its shape, and that therefore there is no way to find out what the whale really looks like.

259
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,440
And the crucial thing is, that wouldn't be the right way to put it.

260
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,920
There is nothing the whale really looks like.

261
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,841
The whale is unrepresentable.

262
00:27:49,841 --> 00:27:52,080
That's what I want to stress.

263
00:27:52,401 --> 00:28:04,960
And why is it important that the unrepresentable is sort of the bottom line, covers most of the, is like the ocean and covers more than half the world and everything.

264
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,200
Why is it important that Moby Dick never can be gotten rid of?

265
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,361
We'll talk about that in a minute.

266
00:28:11,361 --> 00:28:33,760
Well, what I think is that there is something unrepresentable keeps open all the possible interpretations and makes it clear that what is most basic and most powerful and most important can't be captured in any interpretation.

267
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:41,200
And it's very important to have that around because that replaces the onto theology.

268
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,800
That's the tricky thing.

269
00:28:42,801 --> 00:28:44,800
That is the sacred.

270
00:28:45,121 --> 00:28:57,520
The sort of where the ultimate meaning is is in some way not something you can spell out.

271
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:07,801
That doesn't mean that there isn't, that it isn't, it is sacred because it's, I mean, now we're back, the unrepresentable is like the Heidegger understanding of being.

272
00:29:07,801 --> 00:29:11,320
That's the Moby Dick is Heidegger, in a sense.

273
00:29:11,321 --> 00:29:37,881
That is, the understanding of being, remember, is this meaning in our everyday practices and in our language and in our institutions, which makes us show up as the kind of people we are, makes us some kind of human being, a Quequeg kind of human being or a Western kind of human being, or it would make you a Farsi, you know, Zoroaster kind of human being.

274
00:29:38,121 --> 00:29:43,801
But there is something that we cannot, but of course we can't know it.

275
00:29:43,801 --> 00:29:51,160
Remember, Queque is, it's carved into Quequeg's body, his understanding of being, but he can't know it.

276
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,440
It's not the kind of thing you can represent and know.

277
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,321
You can embody the truth, but you cannot know it.

278
00:29:57,321 --> 00:30:00,760
That's the Yates quote I mentioned.

279
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:33,480
So Moby Dick is this important feature of reality, that there is something which gives people's lives meaning and gives them a culture and gives them an identity and gives them a sense of what matters and what's important to do and what's not important to do, and that it can't be captured, expressed, painted, described in philosophy, and so forth.

280
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,441
It's pretty amazing and pretty tricky.

281
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:36,761
Yeah.

282
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,760
No, I say it's the practices themselves.

283
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,641
I mean, what's going on?

284
00:30:41,641 --> 00:30:45,881
Que Clegg's body can't be read by Que Clegg or anybody.

285
00:30:45,881 --> 00:30:50,641
Of course, it doesn't work quite because it looks like the guy who carved it on his body knew it.

286
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:53,680
I think that's a sort of just a mistake.

287
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:58,561
No, what we can't know, well again maybe Heidegger helps.

288
00:30:58,561 --> 00:31:01,281
This is nearest to us but furthest away.

289
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:14,720
It is so our way of being, our way of seeing what it is to be human, our way of understanding objects, our way of having things matter to us, that it's too close for us to see.

290
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,121
And you get a sort of sense if you try, remember, to think about the distance we stand.

291
00:31:19,121 --> 00:31:27,280
I mean, we can get a little bit of a grasp of that and see, because there are contrasting ones, that it's different than other cultures.

292
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,401
Or what it is to be feminine or masculine in our culture.

293
00:31:32,401 --> 00:32:35,881
All that is so built into our bodies and into our language and into our sort of way we relate to each other that it's like another way to put it it's like the water to the fish it's transparent because it's so near because it's so pervasive and because it's so embodied instead of it's in your body and not in your mind all of that all of that sort of sense that there is something now how do you put it in Melville he understands that there is something unrepresentable which is more basic than anything that you can describe or paint or or say or philosophize about and which makes all that other things you can do possible and keeps you from ever thinking you, if you understand if you if you have a sense of it, from ever thinking you have the right answer that it keeps open the source space for making interpretations, which is all that you can do.

294
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:53,081
But if it weren't for that unrepresentable, people would be going around believing that they had the right interpretation, and then they would be finally losing any sense of something more important than their willful interpretations.

295
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,200
You're looking on, I don't blame you, all a little buzzed.

296
00:32:56,201 --> 00:33:05,160
It is so weird to try to explain, one, what Heidegger's talking about, and see that this is how Melville is, what is Melville doing.

297
00:33:05,161 --> 00:33:07,240
But I go back to Melville's talk.

298
00:33:07,241 --> 00:33:13,881
The whale turns out not to be describable, paintable.

299
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:15,561
Science can't deal with it.

300
00:33:15,721 --> 00:33:16,760
And what is that?

301
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:21,560
There's something about the universe very important about reality.

302
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,201
I try to avoid universe because of science.

303
00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:33,161
There's something about reality very important, which you cannot think or describe.

304
00:33:33,161 --> 00:33:37,960
And Moby Dick is, in this book, represents that.

305
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:47,720
Now, lest you think I make this all up, I'll go and give you some quotes about how important it is that Moby Dick stays around.

306
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:52,440
And without Moby Dick, I think the world would just come to an end, according to Melville.

307
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:52,920
Yeah.

308
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,361
How does it form of mind?

309
00:33:54,841 --> 00:33:56,280
Like Moby Dick.

310
00:33:56,281 --> 00:33:58,760
How should we approach something unrepresentable?

311
00:33:58,761 --> 00:34:00,601
He's asking a good question.

312
00:34:01,401 --> 00:34:18,721
Write a book like Moby Dick, obviously, describing the the attempts to to describe Moby Dick and how, and that Moby Dick has no face, and then describing the the ocean and and the sense in which it's bottomless.

313
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:22,401
I can't I don't know I mean let me try a little more.

314
00:34:22,721 --> 00:34:28,401
You you don't try to represent the unrepresentable.

315
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:30,401
That was the wrong thing to do.

316
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,121
You try to point to it somehow.

317
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,520
You can tell me if you're looking like you have an idea.

318
00:34:36,321 --> 00:34:39,040
I don't know things like ordinary humans.

319
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,761
They're something I represent.

320
00:34:42,321 --> 00:34:42,881
Good, good.

321
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:45,920
Yes, if you're not out on the ocean chasing Moby Dick, good.

322
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:50,480
This may help because I see I've lost you and it's not your fault, all of you.

323
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:54,480
So Larry, you are, you're not out on the ocean chasing Moby Dick.

324
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,801
You've never seen the light whale and you never will and you may never be out on the ocean.

325
00:34:58,801 --> 00:35:10,641
How do you relate to this fact that there is something crucial that you can't represent that makes your life, if your life has any meaning and mattering, it's got to have this unrepresentable.

326
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,120
Well, how do you deal with it, relate to that?

327
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,240
Let me think.

328
00:35:16,721 --> 00:35:18,960
Well, I'll just sort of think out loud.

329
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,241
First, they're mostly statements about what you don't do.

330
00:35:22,241 --> 00:35:24,801
You don't try to get a philosophical answer.

331
00:35:24,801 --> 00:35:29,601
You don't try to get a religious answer like Dante gives you.

332
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,081
You don't, now that's the first thing.

333
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:50,001
Secondly, you, I'm trying to think how you appreciate these things like the meal and so forth, the list of things after the squeeze of the hand that he, that, how does that relate?

334
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,920
Well, that's sort of like you don't try to get this ultimate answer.

335
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,001
Well, what do you do then?

336
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:09,721
Well, you have a sense of the sacred in whatever way, in whatever local, fragile, temporary way it shows up.

337
00:36:09,721 --> 00:36:14,601
And one of the ways to talk about that is you let your moods guide you.

338
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,720
And so you never face it head-on.

339
00:36:17,721 --> 00:36:19,240
I think this is part of the answer to you.

340
00:36:19,241 --> 00:36:21,960
If you try to face it head-on, it's not going to work.

341
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:27,080
I mean, that is, in a way, what we're going to find out when we read Ahab, who's been trying to face it head-on.

342
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,801
That is definitely the wrong way to deal with it.

343
00:36:29,801 --> 00:36:50,041
So you have to deal with, get meaning and mattering in your life in a way that is available if you don't try to get control of it, which means get the answer to it.

344
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,321
Is that any help?

345
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,000
It's what?

346
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,801
Queque.

347
00:36:57,241 --> 00:36:59,401
Kweklig is doing much better.

348
00:36:59,401 --> 00:37:17,321
He has his own local sacred for his tribe, and he's not trying to go after Moby Dick, and he isn't doing philosophy, and he walks out on even Father Mappel, who I called sort of multiple monotheism, each person getting their own ultimate answer.

349
00:37:17,321 --> 00:37:20,281
You've got to give up the search for multiple answers.

350
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:24,041
As Moby Dick, the relation to Moby Dick is a kind of negative thing.

351
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:38,201
You appreciate that there's something important you can't deal with, and you don't try to get the Dante answer that everybody's been trying to get in the West ever since Plato.

352
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,120
Boy, is that weird and hard.

353
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,200
But we're on the right track.

354
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,560
David, you want to say something?

355
00:37:43,721 --> 00:37:45,161
Somebody over here.

356
00:37:45,161 --> 00:37:46,200
I saw a hand.

357
00:37:46,201 --> 00:37:47,481
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

358
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,841
I'm just running away?

359
00:37:50,161 --> 00:37:51,521
Yes, of course.

360
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,120
Yeah, yeah, Ishmael has it.

361
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:53,680
Exactly.

362
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,000
I mean, he's right to pin it down.

363
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,761
I sometimes forget what's obvious.

364
00:37:57,761 --> 00:38:07,121
If you want to know how to live in the light of the Moby Dick and the boundless sea and so forth, you are like Ishmael.

365
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:17,681
You're totally suspicious of any one answer, and you're totally suspicious of any one mood, and you're open to all the sacred and all the moods that come along.

366
00:38:17,681 --> 00:38:26,641
And you live like the catscale eagle, never down in despair, although you could be a man of sorrow, that's another possible mood.

367
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:33,361
And never sort of constantly manic like Boomer and Bunger, though that is also a possible mood.

368
00:38:33,361 --> 00:38:42,161
But you've got a lot of moods, and you can go to those extremes, but mostly you have lots of moods in between, and you are open to them.

369
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:44,401
And okay, let me go on.

370
00:38:44,401 --> 00:38:54,001
It may help and it may not, but I think it might that you had this discussion before we talk about the things that you can say about Moby Dick, which are pretty strange.

371
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:25,281
So one of the last ways that everything could be taken over as a whole and given a meaning beyond Christianity and all mono views and beyond philosophy and all of its mono views, there's another tendency in our practices, in our way of dealing with things, which would like to take them all over.

372
00:39:25,281 --> 00:39:27,681
And that is technology.

373
00:39:27,681 --> 00:39:29,360
That's a whole new angle.

374
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:43,721
One of the understandings of being, which is the dominant one now, is to gain control of everything and make it serve our purposes.

375
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,241
And Melville's gone to that too.

376
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,841
That's why he talks about the spaceship Earth.

377
00:39:50,841 --> 00:39:55,881
I mean, he has the sense that everything is being turned into an object.

378
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:02,361
And that would be, that's what the Nantucket people stand for.

379
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:16,681
They've got the whaling technology, which, if they could do it, would turn all the whales into objects and make them all exploitable for their oil and for serving our ends.

380
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:22,680
And that would get rid of the indeterminate and the indefinite.

381
00:40:22,761 --> 00:40:32,760
It would just treat everything equally as an object to be studied by science and used by technology, including Moby Dick.

382
00:40:32,761 --> 00:40:34,600
And so he worries about that.

383
00:40:35,881 --> 00:40:37,960
And he's again ahead of his time.

384
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,521
He has a sense that the whole world is going to be understood and mastered.

385
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:56,280
And Melville thinks of that, and he thinks of that as what if whaling could, and it's now comes, this is all weird and mind-boggling.

386
00:40:56,281 --> 00:41:00,201
What if you could combine ontology with ecology?

387
00:41:00,201 --> 00:41:02,440
That's something that Melville does.

388
00:41:03,401 --> 00:41:18,281
If you don't, if it would be disastrous to get rid of Moby Dick and the ocean as holding openness indeterminate, then you better not fish out all the whales.

389
00:41:18,281 --> 00:41:28,960
But unfortunately, this technological holism, this technological totalism wants to fish out all the whales, and he worries about that.

390
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:43,361
What if it was what if the well, before we get to that, this whole tendency would objectify everything, and I didn't say that, but it would of course take over the pagans and their religions and wipe them out.

391
00:41:43,361 --> 00:41:45,761
It would take over the sacred and wipe it out.

392
00:41:45,761 --> 00:41:48,001
It would get rid of divine intuitions.

393
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,081
Everything would be scientifically intelligible and technologically manipulable.

394
00:41:54,080 --> 00:42:00,240
And that is a big problem for Melville.

395
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:02,161
He really worries about it.

396
00:42:02,801 --> 00:42:04,881
Now I have to catch up.

397
00:42:04,881 --> 00:42:18,561
So there's got to be this kind of permanent resistance to this kind of conversion of everything into objects to be used, into commodities, into resources for us.

398
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,640
And that gets into this problem of what's happening to the whales.

399
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:34,960
The ontology gets him into ecology in the weirdest way and gets him the weirdest views on ecology because it's all sort of in the metaphor of whales.

400
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,440
So he's worrying about the fact that the whales could be fished out.

401
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,401
This is in page 444.

402
00:42:42,401 --> 00:42:44,481
This is chapter 105.

403
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,040
Does the whale's magnitude diminish?

404
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,321
Will he perish?

405
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,800
And he's worrying about that.

406
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,960
About the because of that.

407
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,240
Because of the Nantucket people.

408
00:42:54,241 --> 00:42:58,001
Now it's the Japanese who are fishing up all the whales.

409
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,600
But whatever.

410
00:43:00,881 --> 00:43:04,681
If they if we don't he's worried that they're going to get rid of all the whales.

411
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
But still, another inquiry remains.

412
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:09,320
This is the second paragraph on 444.

413
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:16,841
But still, another inquiry remains, one often agitated by the more recondite Nantucketeers.

414
00:43:17,401 --> 00:43:18,841
Let's see now.

415
00:43:18,841 --> 00:43:21,881
They've got thousands of harpoons and so forth.

416
00:43:21,881 --> 00:43:26,120
The moot point is whether Leviathan can long endure so wide a chase.

417
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,561
This is very relevant.

418
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:41,081
And so remorseless a havoc, whether he must not at last be exterminated from the waters and the last whale, like the last man, smoke his last pipe and then evaporate in the final puff.

419
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,321
This is the whole save the whales story.

420
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:47,561
Why are people so upset that the whales could be fished out?

421
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:55,240
Well, Melville would say because they have a sense that this would be a way the technology would be taking over something important.

422
00:43:55,241 --> 00:44:04,440
At the bottom of 445, furthermore, concerning these last-mentioned leviathans, they have, this is why the whales are not going to be fished out.

423
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,481
A funny story.

424
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:10,840
They have two firm fortresses, which in all human probability will forever remain impregnable.

425
00:44:10,841 --> 00:44:14,041
So he thinks you can't get rid of the unrepresentable.

426
00:44:16,841 --> 00:44:28,361
And as upon the invasion of their valleys, the Swiss retreat to the mountains and so forth, the whales are going to retreat to the Arctic and the Antarctic.

427
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,241
And it better be like that.

428
00:44:31,241 --> 00:44:39,000
Because if the whale, without the whales in this symbolic role of the unrepresentable, there won't be any meaning, any culture, anything.

429
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:52,401
I mean, if everything could be taken over in technology, we'd be, everybody would be happy, presumably, and have all their desires fulfilled as clearly and simply as possible.

430
00:44:52,721 --> 00:45:08,881
But the kind of mattering that people need, whether it be the kind of mattering that goes with the squeeze of the hand or a kind of mattering that goes with the sacred, they're closely related, would just be taken up and eliminated.

431
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:13,201
But he thinks it won't happen at the bottom of 446, the end of the chapter.

432
00:45:13,201 --> 00:45:21,440
Wherefore, for all those things, we account the whale immortal in his species, however perishable in his individuality, and so forth.

433
00:45:22,401 --> 00:45:35,121
So that's because the whale stands for something, the saving something that religion and science and so forth can't get rid of.

434
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:47,041
It's a kind of ontological optimism turned into a kind of ecological optimism, and I can't really do more with it than that.

435
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:55,120
I mean, these are possible subjects in here, I'm sure, for interesting papers that you have to, remember, clear it with your TA before you try them.

436
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:55,920
Yeah.

437
00:45:59,761 --> 00:46:00,321
That's right.

438
00:46:00,321 --> 00:46:07,361
No, he's really sensitive to science, and he's really, I think, worried about the question whether the whales will be fished out.

439
00:46:07,361 --> 00:46:08,241
But you're right.

440
00:46:08,241 --> 00:46:14,640
And he turns it into not a question about how to save the whales, but that the whale stands for something.

441
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:34,401
The white whale, the sperm whale anyway, stands for something ontological, which can't be wiped out, but is but science is the big enemy of it, because science would like to get it all represented, all put into a system and controlled and understood.

442
00:46:35,161 --> 00:46:46,200
And so he thinks that this tendency to sort of fish up the whales has got to be a dangerous tendency, which isn't really fish up the whales.

443
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,721
That's the crucial thing.

444
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:50,120
It's technology taking over everything.

445
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,960
That's, he thinks, is dangerous.

446
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,960
He thinks, but he isn't sure, that it's impossible.

447
00:46:56,361 --> 00:47:00,280
But if it were possible, there wouldn't be any us anymore.

448
00:47:00,281 --> 00:47:06,760
There might be nice, happy kind of Homo sapiens running around, but they wouldn't be human beings and things wouldn't matter.

449
00:47:06,761 --> 00:47:09,081
That's what he's intuitive.

450
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:09,641
Yeah.

451
00:47:10,681 --> 00:47:10,920
Yes.

452
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:19,560
Yes, every once in a while he gives a whole rant or he jokes about this attempt of scientists to understand the whale.

453
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:28,361
Of course, that's the very first thing in the book where he gets this higgly-piggly random bunch of quotes about the whale that don't add up to any understanding of it.

454
00:47:28,361 --> 00:47:41,321
But again, everywhere, but of course, if the whale has, it can't be drawn, can't be measured, can't be described and so forth, science is not going to get it.

455
00:47:41,321 --> 00:47:44,600
And of course, science, well, period.

456
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,721
And yes, that's part of the same argument.

457
00:47:47,721 --> 00:47:48,920
That's another version.

458
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:55,560
I see what you're saying, of the fact that the whale can't be taken over by science and technology.

459
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:10,841
You could say it's going to hide under the polar ice caps, or you could just say science and technology with their methods can't get the unrepresentable basis of our meaningful existence.

460
00:48:10,841 --> 00:48:11,640
Something like that.

461
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,600
You're looking worried.

462
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:13,960
That's okay.

463
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:14,600
That's okay.

464
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,881
You're looking less worried.

465
00:48:15,881 --> 00:48:16,640
That's good.

466
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,121
Yeah.

467
00:48:16,361 --> 00:48:19,440
I see.

468
00:48:16,681 --> 00:48:21,760
Yeah, I bet he worries about surveillance too.

469
00:48:22,321 --> 00:48:24,161
Where does he talk about that?

470
00:48:24,321 --> 00:48:26,480
444, back to 444.

471
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,280
I'm interested.

472
00:48:27,281 --> 00:48:28,160
He's got this.

473
00:48:28,401 --> 00:48:32,081
Remember, this is 100 years ago.

474
00:48:32,161 --> 00:48:34,160
100 and what?

475
00:48:34,241 --> 00:48:42,720
This is 1850, so there's 150 years ago, that he's already worrying about things that lots of people are worrying about now.

476
00:48:42,721 --> 00:48:44,960
And I don't just mean ecology.

477
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:53,920
I mean the whole worry that science is going to try to take over and explain and manipulate everything and so forth.

478
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,681
Yeah, where does he say it now?

479
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,321
Ah, the mastheads of the psoas over the wet.

480
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:15,040
Ah, so the almost omniscient lookouts are the ones who are the ones who make it possible to get all the whales.

481
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,720
And of course, they're going to be more and more.

482
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:27,521
They're going to be GPS and all better, more omniscient lookouts that guide the, I guess, at least the Japanese and the Norwegians to hunt down the whales.

483
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:34,401
By the way, just for your information, there was a student who wrote an interesting PhD thesis about this whaling thing.

484
00:49:34,401 --> 00:49:38,481
This is just an aside, but it's something one should know.

485
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:53,201
This woman wrote a very interesting thesis about the power of rhetoric and the power of the slogan, save the whales, and the money that that brings in to these really right-minded people who want to save the whales.

486
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,640
But the whales aren't endangered, it turns out.

487
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:01,601
There's something called Minky Whales, whatever they are, which are many, many, many, many of them.

488
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:09,081
So that it turns out that if the Japanese and the Norwegians would just stick to fishing the Minky whales, there wouldn't be any problem.

489
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:21,321
But they will go on saying, Save the whales, because that slogan is going to bring in lots of donations to help them with their worthy cause, even though the whales aren't endangered.

490
00:50:21,321 --> 00:50:22,600
Not whales in general.

491
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,040
Now, I don't know about sperm whale.

492
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:28,520
I don't think people go after sperm whales anymore to get the perfume in their heads.

493
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,520
I think they make their perfume other ways.

494
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:31,721
I don't know.

495
00:50:31,721 --> 00:50:38,920
Ambergris Weddood, which is the special sperm stuff, I don't think that's, I don't think that's a valuable product anymore.

496
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,321
They go after the whales for meat.

497
00:50:41,321 --> 00:50:44,200
And any old kind of whale will do for me.

498
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:45,561
Okay.

499
00:50:46,201 --> 00:50:49,401
I think I go back to, okay, let's see now.

500
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:51,480
Ah, we're getting right up to the hunt.

501
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,041
Okay.

502
00:50:52,040 --> 00:51:00,361
After much suspense, Ahab has finally tracked down Moby Dick and prepares to fight him.

503
00:51:00,361 --> 00:51:11,321
And it's the long postponed showdown of the adventure story of this kind of pursuit and revenge that's the story of the book.

504
00:51:11,321 --> 00:51:30,201
But it's also a metaphysical contest between this willful, insistent demand for an ultimate answer and the blankness, the very almost intolerable blankness of the white whale that won't give us any clear answers to what it's all about.

505
00:51:30,201 --> 00:51:39,721
And in the course of the hunt, we've been told that Moby Dick is maliciously intelligent, awkwardly intelligent, a dumb brute.

506
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:40,680
Starbucks.

507
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:42,361
I'm going to fill this in, by the way, in a minute.

508
00:51:42,361 --> 00:51:45,720
I've been saying this, but I haven't given you quotes to back it up.

509
00:51:45,721 --> 00:51:50,320
He's a fulfiller of prophecies, an instrument of moral retribution.

510
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:58,641
I mean, we could make a kind of quiz out of it where in which these stories come out when they meet some other ship.

511
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:08,001
And now I'm going to just sort of call your attention to the fact that every time they meet some ship that knows something about Moby Dick, what would you expect?

512
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:25,280
Of course, a totally other interpretation and evidence of what Moby Dick is up to, which cancels the other interpretations, or unless you can just hold them all in mind at once, which is the right thing to do, and then you could have a kind of rainbow of interpretations.

513
00:52:25,841 --> 00:52:29,440
But that is, for Ahab, that's impossible.

514
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,800
But anyway, so here we go.

515
00:52:30,801 --> 00:52:32,401
I want to give you some of these.

516
00:52:33,361 --> 00:52:38,401
So he's maliciously intelligent on 176.

517
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:45,280
That's the one we know, the familiar one, where he takes off Ahab's leg.

518
00:52:45,281 --> 00:52:47,361
That's chapter 41.

519
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,881
It's a long chapter toward the end.

520
00:52:52,241 --> 00:53:00,321
I'm just going to quote a quote just to put maliciously intelligent on the map on 176 second paragraph.

521
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:08,320
More than all, middle of the paragraph, more than all, his treacherous retreat struck more dismay than perhaps aught else.

522
00:53:08,321 --> 00:53:24,321
For when swimming before his exalting pursuers with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times been known to turn around suddenly and bearing down upon them, either stave their boats to splinters or drive them back in consternation to their ships.

523
00:53:24,321 --> 00:53:30,960
That sounds like he's smart, he knows what he's doing, he's not a clumsy, dumb brute.

524
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:45,001
But there's also, and this is what we haven't ever talked about, these ways that he seems to be moral and have a purpose.

525
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,161
So we've got to talk about two of them.

526
00:53:47,161 --> 00:53:51,481
One of them is the town hoe story, and that's on 250.

527
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,361
So where are we?

528
00:53:52,361 --> 00:53:54,041
250.

529
00:53:55,401 --> 00:53:57,720
Okay, long chapter.

530
00:53:57,721 --> 00:53:58,680
The town hoe story.

531
00:53:58,681 --> 00:54:00,521
It's a long story.

532
00:54:00,841 --> 00:54:02,521
Whoa, is it a long story?

533
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:09,321
Gee, it's chapter 54, and I am in the middle of it or near the end of it.

534
00:54:09,321 --> 00:54:19,321
No, I'm near the end of it, about three pages from the end of this long one, in which there's this bad guy, Radney, and this very good guy, Steelekild.

535
00:54:19,321 --> 00:54:27,320
And Steelekilt's about to kill Radney because Radney's such a bad guy and has turned everybody against Steelekill.

536
00:54:27,321 --> 00:54:37,401
And then in the middle of, and somebody's telling this story, and in the middle of 250, but gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody deed he had planned.

537
00:54:37,401 --> 00:54:42,761
Yet complete revenge he had, and without being the avenger.

538
00:54:42,761 --> 00:54:57,960
For by a mysterious fatality, heaven itself seemed to step in and take out of his hands its own and take out of his hands and into its own the damning thing he would have done.

539
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:02,761
Okay, that's he would have killed Radney, but who was really obnoxious.

540
00:55:02,761 --> 00:55:07,960
But Moby Dick kills Radney instead on 251, the middle of the page.

541
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,361
The mutineer was the bowsman.

542
00:55:10,361 --> 00:55:15,240
The mutineer is Steelekill of the mate.

543
00:55:15,241 --> 00:55:24,960
And when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next to him while Radney stood up with his lance in the prow to haul in the slackened line and so forth.

544
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:41,760
And then at the bottom, the whale, well, about three-quarters of the way down, the whale comes up under the boat, and suddenly the boat struck as against a sunken ledge and keeling over, spilled out the standing mate.

545
00:55:41,761 --> 00:55:44,241
That's Radney the bad guy.

546
00:55:44,241 --> 00:55:55,201
The instant as he fell on the whale's slippery back, the boat rided and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was tossed over into the sea on the other flank of the whale.

547
00:55:55,201 --> 00:56:02,480
He struck out through the spray and for an instant was dimly seen through that veil, wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick.

548
00:56:02,721 --> 00:56:05,520
He's got eyeball contact with Moby Dick.

549
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:15,361
That the whale rushed around in a sudden maelstrom, seized the swimmer between his jaws, and rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again and went down.

550
00:56:15,361 --> 00:56:21,040
That's the end of Radney, and that's the whale as moral avenger.

551
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,521
That's the Town Ho story.

552
00:56:25,361 --> 00:56:29,041
And that, in other words, is not a malicious intelligence.

553
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:36,721
That is a moral intelligence on the good guy's side of the pictures.

554
00:56:36,721 --> 00:56:40,481
And then there's Moby Dick as the fulfiller of prophecies.

555
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,561
That's the Jeroboam story.

556
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:45,040
There's a mad sailor named Gabriel.

557
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:56,001
He predicts the death of the chief mate Macy if he pursues Moby Dick, the way Moses predicts the plagues that come to Israel if the Pharaoh won't release the Hebrews.

558
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,760
That Macy disregards the prophet and pursues the whales.

559
00:56:59,761 --> 00:57:01,440
Now we're in 306.

560
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:09,881
306 and the bottom of 306, we're in chapter 70.

561
00:57:10,201 --> 00:57:15,321
We are two-thirds into chapter 70.

562
00:57:15,321 --> 00:57:24,601
And it's the bottom of 306 where Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the white whale, skipping a little.

563
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,160
Moby Dick was sighted from the mastheads.

564
00:57:27,161 --> 00:57:39,080
Macy, the chief mate, burned with ardor to encounter him, and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity, despite all the archangel's denunciations, they call Gabriel the archangel.

565
00:57:39,241 --> 00:57:43,960
That is the name of the, that is really the name of the archangel in the Bible.

566
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:51,640
So then you get another one of these stories, which starts at the top of 307 in this long paragraph.

567
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:55,000
It seemed that, about half into the paragraph.

568
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:12,841
Now, while Macy the mate was standing up in his boat's bow and with all the reckless energy of his tribe, was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo, a broad white shadow rose from the sea by its quick fanning motion, taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen.

569
00:58:12,841 --> 00:58:23,561
Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of furious life, was switting bodily into the air and making a long arc in his descent, fell into the sea at a distance of about 50 yards.

570
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:30,681
Not the chip of the boat was harmed, not a hair of any oarsman's head, but the chief mate forever sank.

571
00:58:30,681 --> 00:58:36,681
So Moby Dick did exactly execute the prophecy.

572
00:58:36,681 --> 00:58:43,161
And now we are ready, I think, to go to the chase.

573
00:58:43,161 --> 00:58:49,440
But we are also near enough the end of the hour that you have been saved for having it told you until next time.

574
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,120
But I will get very close.

575
00:58:49,241 --> 00:58:52,480
So let me see where we are.

576
00:58:53,761 --> 00:58:58,960
Well, let me see if you can predict what's going to happen in the chase.

577
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:04,480
I'll tell you that there's going to be three separate encounters with Moby Dick.

578
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,081
Each time when they go out to get him, something happens.

579
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:22,560
And what are you going to find out, do you think, that when you finally get Moby Dick close enough, when they get close enough to really encounter Moby Dick, so to speak, head on, which is going to turn out to be right?

580
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:36,241
Maliciousness, indifference, stupidity, moral determination, how to get Ahab?

581
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,401
What do you think?

582
00:59:38,401 --> 00:59:39,201
Which?

583
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:40,881
None of them?

584
00:59:41,201 --> 00:59:42,080
All of them.

585
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:42,560
Right.

586
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,040
Good.

587
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,320
Several people said that.

588
00:59:44,321 --> 00:59:45,121
You get it?

589
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,480
Yes, all of them.

590
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,280
That's what happens in the chase.

591
00:59:49,281 --> 00:59:51,601
Keep your eyes open when you get there.

592
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,641
It's a brilliant tour d'Eforce.

593
00:59:54,640 --> 01:00:07,201
And keep your eye open for what kind of confrontation Ahab finally gets when he gets really up close.

594
01:00:07,201 --> 01:00:09,761
And let's just start.

595
01:00:10,161 --> 01:00:11,440
Well, what do we do?

596
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,121
I have to think a minute.

597
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:16,081
I think I should stop while we're ahead here.

598
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:19,281
And you have you've got the right answer, all of them.

599
01:00:20,721 --> 01:00:25,601
How many let's say how many again haven't got up to the chase in the end of the book?

600
01:00:26,241 --> 01:00:27,681
How many would be there?

601
01:00:27,681 --> 01:00:31,680
How many wouldn't be there even if I waited until Thursday?

602
01:00:31,681 --> 01:00:34,401
How many can you can you think you can get there by Thursday?

603
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:42,280
Well, I'm sir I would rather you get there by Thursday and that we stop now than just by a difference of 15 minutes.

604
01:00:42,281 --> 01:00:44,681
I spoil all this exciting prose.

605
01:00:44,681 --> 01:00:48,281
Okay, so next time I'm going to finish the book.
