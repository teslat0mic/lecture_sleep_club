1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,560
So since the first sentence of Moby Dick is, call me Ishmael, the first thing is to talk about Ishmael, who is also, that's Melville's, so to speak, name in the book, but it's really Melville himself is Ishmael.

2
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:19,600
And Ishmael is a wanderer.

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:27,200
He was Abraham's illegitimate son, cast out by Sarah when they had their own legitimate son, Isaac.

4
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,239
And he then became an outcast and a wanderer.

5
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:37,840
I take it from Melville's point of view, he's the perfect example of somebody that has no world of his own, no identity of his own.

6
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,159
And notice that the writer of the book isn't even named Ishmael.

7
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:44,000
He says, call me Ishmael.

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,679
We don't know the name of the writer of the book.

9
00:00:47,680 --> 00:01:02,719
And also Melville, in the copy of the book that you all have, The Signet Classic, I was struck, I never saw before, a brief summary of Melville's life, which sounds pretty Ishmael-ish.

10
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:13,199
His father's bankruptcy and death in 1832 deprived him of higher educational opportunities and put him outside the conventional view of life.

11
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:21,519
So I didn't realize he's self-educated, knowing all the Shakespeare and Milton and Bible and Farses and so forth.

12
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,799
But so what did he do?

13
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,079
He taught school.

14
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,239
He sailed to Liverpool and back.

15
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:38,239
Then he shipped on another whale, on a whaling voyage, he deserted at the Marquis Islands, lived for a month among the cannibals, and came out alive.

16
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:44,000
And then he got picked up by an Australian whale ship that took him to Tahiti, where he was jailed for mutiny.

17
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:53,879
But he escaped and spent some months as a beach comber until a third whaling ship took him to Hawaii and then he lived there for a while.

18
00:01:53,879 --> 00:02:00,919
Talk about somebody who is rootless and has just a whole bunch of jobs, none of which define him.

19
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,120
And he says that he's been teaching at the beginning of this book.

20
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,519
So he obviously goes from teaching to whaling to writing.

21
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:15,079
And through it all, and this is what begins to make it polytheistic, he's very moody.

22
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:19,000
And his moods really tell him what to do.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:40,919
So the book begins, Call Me Ishmael, and then a little further down, whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth, whenever it's a damn drizzly November in my soul, whenever I find myself bringing up the end of every funeral procession, and so forth and so forth, then it's time for me to go to sea, he says.

24
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,079
So he's dictated by his moods.

25
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,560
He doesn't freely decide to go to sea.

26
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,839
There's a certain time when he just has to go to sea.

27
00:02:49,079 --> 00:03:00,280
On page five, he says that there's a fate that has constant surveillance of me and dogs me and influences me in some unaccountable way.

28
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,080
I take that to mean that it's always my moods that lead me and influence me.

29
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,680
I don't decide what to do and when to do it.

30
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:21,479
And that makes him all remind you of Homer and the gods who are the moods who attune people to their situations and lead them to do whatever they do.

31
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:39,039
Now, normally I don't really pay attention to the letters and the sort of critical stuff, but there's a letter from Melville to Hawthorne, which is so illuminating and so much agrees with my interpretation that I often read it.

32
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:46,719
So, Melville always admired Hawthorne and thought he was, Hawthorne was the great one, and Melville was sort of a failure, even as a writer.

33
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:53,680
And that's sort of ironic, because Hawthorne is still read, but Moby Dick is more and more counted the great American novel.

34
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,560
At the time, people didn't know what to make of it.

35
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:06,960
So he says to Hawthorne, in me, divine magnanimities, magnanimities are spontaneous and instantaneous.

36
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,560
Catch them while you can.

37
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,839
The world goes around and another side comes up.

38
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:17,360
I take these divine magnanimities to be the moods that catch him.

39
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:23,759
And then he says the famous line, I've written a wicked book and feel spotless as a lamb.

40
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:43,040
Why it's a wicked book, you have to read the whole book to find out, but roughly, because it's totally anti-Christian, but it's anti-any form of supreme being, any view or culture that thinks it's got an answer to the meaning of the universe.

41
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:52,639
It's, from Melville's point of view, everything is interpretation all the way down, which from a Christian and Hawthorne-like point of view would be a wicked book.

42
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,079
But he doesn't mind.

43
00:04:54,079 --> 00:05:01,439
In fact, he's sort of the next sentence says, I don't mind having written a book that's wicked from a Christian point of view.

44
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:03,040
I'm a polytheist.

45
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,479
He says, ineffable socialities are in me.

46
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,599
I would sit down and dine with you and all the gods in old Rome's pantheon.

47
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,680
That he should have said Greeks, but he doesn't seem to know much about Greek.

48
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,840
He knows all the antiquity stuff from the Roman.

49
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,800
But there it is.

50
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:21,080
He feels fine.

51
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,759
He's written his book.

52
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:39,639
His book is utterly anti-anything which later in the course or already in the course, starting with Dante, we've called onto theology, the idea that there is some supreme being in which everything is grounded and which you can make sense of it.

53
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:50,040
And one more moody remark, which is, if anybody knows Foucault, you'll recognize Foucault said the same thing 150 years later.

54
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,000
Or is it 200?

55
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,120
200?

56
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:55,800
1850, this is, well, 170 or something.

57
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm bad at arithmetic.

58
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,520
So here's what he ends up saying to Hawthorne in this letter.

59
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:03,560
This is a long letter, but you're not bound to answer it.

60
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,840
Possibly, if you do answer it and direct it to Herman Melville, you will missend it.

61
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:15,399
For the very fingers that now guide this pen are not precisely the same that just took it up and put it on this paper.

62
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:17,960
Lord, when shall we be done changing?

63
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:25,240
And that's just so perfect for the way the book works that I couldn't resist reading it.

64
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,839
So here we are.

65
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:40,599
Ishmael is like Odysseus, only even more of a wanderer, because Odysseus has a home to go to, finally, where his wife and Penelope and Telemachus are waiting for him.

66
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,520
Ishmael is a total wanderer.

67
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:47,800
He has no home and no family, the way it's uh set up here.

68
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:55,080
No job, no olive tree bed that's anchored in the earth because as uh Odysseus has.

69
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:58,040
And in fact, he has no roots at all.

70
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:03,120
And he lives in a whole range of possible worlds.

71
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:05,680
Now I wonder why I said possible worlds.

72
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,800
I think a whole range of worlds is all it is that I want to say.

73
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,680
And he wants to be at home in all of them.

74
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,079
And he says this on, I'll keep reading little things because I want to keep you in touch with the text.

75
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:30,719
So he says, I love to sail, listen to Ishmael now, I love to sail forbidden seas and land on barbarous coasts, not ignoring what is good.

76
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,439
I'm quick to perceive a horror and could still be social with it, would they let me?

77
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:41,120
Since it is well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in.

78
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:49,040
And that is, in other words, be at home in all the worlds that you can travel to.

79
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:57,599
And he gets pulled into lots of different worlds, as Ads did Melville, as you could see from what I read.

80
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:03,120
And in each, he respects the gods of that world.

81
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:19,120
And when Kleequeg, the black savage, shows up and is worshiping his god, Yo-Yo, then Melville, or Ishmael, worships Yo-Yo.

82
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:27,440
And he's the total enemy of what I sometimes call monolithic monotheism.

83
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,159
What I once said Nietzsche calls monotonot in a theism.

84
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:31,600
I think he would agree.

85
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:42,879
And he's against it because it excludes being open to all those gods and all those worlds, all those understandings of the sacred that you can be, let yourself be pulled into.

86
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:43,719
No willpower.

87
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:51,400
Just get in, if you get attuned, if your mood attunes you to them, then you take up their sense of the sacred.

88
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,440
And that doesn't mean that any of them are true.

89
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,120
Being true or not true just isn't the point.

90
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:11,960
Being sacred, being something that is important to people in a way that I'll explain in a minute, is what makes them valuable, not that they get it right about the universe.

91
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,840
There is no way to get it right about the universe.

92
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,080
Later he'll say that Moby Dick has no face.

93
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:25,960
That is, there's no right way to draw the way Moby Dick looks, because there's no way Moby Dick looks.

94
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:43,480
But anybody who thinks there's one right answer to the world and our place in it is humorless, fanatical, dangerous, a philosopher, which he thinks is somebody who tries to think they've got the one right answer.

95
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,520
So he says that he wants to be at home with every religion.

96
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:51,879
See, this is a kind of higher polytheism, as you can see.

97
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:58,040
I mean, in the polytheism, there was one religion, and something like ten gods and goddesses.

98
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:01,320
Now it's polyreligionism or something.

99
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:04,120
There's a whole bunch of religions out there.

100
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:18,120
And not only do you get in tune with the various, say, ten gods of, you know, Aries, the aggressive god and Aphrodite, the erotic goddess, and so forth, and you can get in tune with those we talked about in the Odyssey.

101
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,160
You can get in tune with all sorts of religions.

102
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:25,320
And the place where he explains that most is on page 79.

103
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:32,480
He says in the third sentence, I cherish the greatest respect toward everybody's religious obligations, never mind how comical.

104
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:51,519
See, he thinks that it's comical that Kuikleg worships this little wooden statue, Yo-Yo, and kisses Yo-Yo on the nose before going to bed, but he does it too, and not ironically, and not laughing, laughing at it or with it or something, but in no way putting it down.

105
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,920
He thinks that Kuikweg is a sort of saint and that his religion is a very good religion.

106
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:12,960
But he says in the next paragraph, I say we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these things and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals, pagans and whatnot, because of their half-crazy conceits on this subject.

107
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:28,800
And then comes a very important sentence that he never explains at the end of that paragraph: Heaven have mercy on all of us, Presbyterians and pagans alike, for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head and sadly need mending.

108
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:34,319
There's something fundamentally incomplete or wrong about human beings.

109
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:39,120
I mean, from a Christian point of view, it would be sin, but in some pagan culture, it would be something else.

110
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,759
But there's something that people need that religion can satisfy, that the sacred can satisfy.

111
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:55,280
And it doesn't have to be the supreme being, as in Dante, that gives you the total satisfaction when you stare into God's depths.

112
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,760
But something has to heal you.

113
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:07,120
And since I was just reading near the end of the book today, when Quique gets very sick and almost dies, he doesn't die.

114
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,240
And he looks completely serene and happy in his illness.

115
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:23,720
And it's clear that he's been, though he's fit physically, he's been healed spiritually.

116
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,720
And those words are connected.

117
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:36,440
Being healed, being healthy, being holy, in German, Heil, which does all this job in one word, is what he's talking about here.

118
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,600
Human beings need that.

119
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,360
He needs that.

120
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:46,920
In his view, the more versions of the healing that you can get attuned to, the better.

121
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:50,920
If anybody wants to say anything, by the way, feel free to interrupt.

122
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:54,759
This vast number of people out there must have many questions on that.

123
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,199
So now we're on the next issue.

124
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,680
That was the sort of background polytheism, which will become clearer as we go on.

125
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:13,160
Now comes Ishmael on the mysterious, the fundamentally mysterious and indefinite nature of reality.

126
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:21,000
It's the experience of this kind of indefinite mysteriousness that keeps you open to all the worlds.

127
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,240
Once you think you've got an answer, then you just have the answer.

128
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:34,279
But if you understand that not only you don't have the answer, but the very idea that there is an answer is wrong, then you're open to everything.

129
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,480
Aha, I knew you'd have to.

130
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:48,600
No, no, you don't need the variety, but you're onto something puzzling about this whole book because it, let's try to think about it.

131
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,120
Certainly, he thinks that any one of the particular ones will do.

132
00:13:52,120 --> 00:14:02,480
There's only one kind of religion that doesn't heal you, and that's Christianity and all the onto-theological religions who think they have one, the one truth.

133
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:14,560
But otherwise, he talks about visiting various places in the course of the book where he sits down and goes to their temples or drinks their drugs or whatever it is that their religion has.

134
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:24,000
Now, why does he think, or does he, that it's better to be open to many of them than to just be living in one of them?

135
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,320
That's a very, very, very good question.

136
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,080
It should have been a paper talk.

137
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:35,760
And the first thing to say is, generally, he doesn't think that many is a good thing.

138
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:42,000
He's perfectly happy with Quequeg's pagan religion healing him.

139
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:51,439
But there's something about the situation of Western 19th-century human beings that makes it necessary.

140
00:14:51,440 --> 00:15:01,840
I'm thinking out loud, I don't know the answer yet, makes it necessary for them to collect the sacred here and there wherever it locally manifests itself.

141
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,720
At least it's necessary for Ishmael for some reason.

142
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:12,320
Now, and I take it it's for Ishmael qua modern, uprooted, post-Christian person.

143
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,720
Now, why can't he just settle down with one of these religions?

144
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,879
Why is he collecting openness to the sacred?

145
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,319
Yes, but that's just the name of the question in a way.

146
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:38,720
Why does he think being open to cross-cultural sacredness is a good religion for him instead of settling down with Quiqueg, for instance, and taking up his religion?

147
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:45,320
It seems somehow this is not very satisfactory, what I'm saying, but that there's just a feeling of the more sacred, the better.

148
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:53,160
And that once you've gotten loose from any particular culture, you go and experience them all.

149
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,879
And that's somehow, I haven't really answered you, an advantage over the ones that are in each particular one.

150
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:06,120
Somehow you get more of you healed, or different ways you're cracked about the head get healed, or something.

151
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,080
Ah, good.

152
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,759
Yes, you're right.

153
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,799
Let's put that in.

154
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:10,920
We're coming to that.

155
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:20,040
But yes, there's something about the indefiniteness which is important.

156
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:22,519
But you see, you turned it the other way than I turn it.

157
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:29,720
I think it's because there is this basic indefiniteness in the universe that he's open to all these sacreds.

158
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,719
And you think that what?

159
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:35,959
I will say what you said again.

160
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,720
It seemed to me not what I said just.

161
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:47,639
The mood is important part of it.

162
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:50,279
That's the sort of super polytheism.

163
00:16:50,279 --> 00:17:01,799
Just as there's not just one goddess, a god or goddess in the pantheon, how you have to be sensitive to being aggressive, to being domestic, to being erotic, to being a sort of nerd like Festus.

164
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:02,839
Why?

165
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:13,000
And it seems that it just takes all of these because you have all these various capacities to exercise.

166
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:25,640
So since there are all these moods, and since different religions you get attuned to through different moods, somehow, of course, we're getting to the same non-question.

167
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:42,400
Somehow, the more moods you can use and the more things you can get attuned to, there's a place where he talks about why he doesn't want to be just looking at the sun.

168
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,599
Well, no, this is the same thing.

169
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:46,319
He certainly doesn't want to be just looking at God.

170
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:48,480
And he certainly doesn't want to be in despair.

171
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,319
We'll talk about that later.

172
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:57,599
But we're still back to the question, what's the advantage of experiencing all these different moods?

173
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:11,359
I think all I can say is they're there, if you're capable of them, and each one of them gives you some insight into what you are and some kind of satisfaction or meaning, then the more the better.

174
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:12,880
That's the best I can do.

175
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,200
Yeah.

176
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,639
I wish that every school plays this level of connection to one world to another.

177
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,599
Then you can find all these different.

178
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,759
And he that's nice, but why not embody just one sacred?

179
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:39,039
You don't know this yet, really, unless you've, I don't know how far you've gotten in the reading, but Quiqueg, I talked about it in the last lecture, embodies one sacred.

180
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:44,720
It's carved on his body by the prophet of his tribe, and he's saved.

181
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,839
So what's the advantage?

182
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:49,599
I think, again, I get this feeling.

183
00:18:49,599 --> 00:19:02,639
Well, that would be fine if Melville had a tradition that had in it the sacred and the divine anymore, if it hadn't lost it, and if he had been brought up in those practices and they were carved into his body, he would be saved.

184
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,279
But he can't, he's this postmodern person.

185
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:10,799
He can't just take over his tradition the way Quiqueg can as a saving theme.

186
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:11,039
Yeah.

187
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,199
Well, education is kind of trying to learn a little bit about it.

188
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:26,759
I think that may be a sort of psychological explanation about Ishmael, but the fact that he didn't go to Oxford or Berkeley makes him open maybe in some special way.

189
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:45,319
But he's certainly trying to say that given the way things are, openness to moods and worlds is, of course, he says it's how he is, but I think he means is that's how anybody is who's sensitive to the way things are and knows how to get healed.

190
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:49,079
Okay, now that'll give me plenty to think about.

191
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,439
Now let me see.

192
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:59,640
So now comes the next thing we want to, I have been saying, but I haven't really given you any examples of this important way that everything is indeterminate.

193
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,279
And there is no way anything is.

194
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:06,279
There are only interpretations.

195
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:15,000
He does it in this funny way in chapter 3, the Spouter Inn on page 10, where he sees a picture.

196
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,920
And he goes and what he does every once in a while when he's about to say something important, he switches from I to you and sort of brings you in.

197
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,039
So here we go.

198
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:25,000
We're brought in.

199
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:33,879
Entering the gable-ended spouter inn, you found yourself in a wide, low, straggling entry with old-fashioned Wayne Scotts and so forth.

200
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:53,319
And then on one side on a very large old painting, oil painting, so thoroughly besmoked and in every way defaced, in the unequal cross-lights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it and careful inquiry of the neighbors that you could in any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose.

201
00:20:53,319 --> 00:21:04,240
Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist in the time of the New England hags had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched.

202
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:05,759
And it is chaos.

203
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,720
That's another word he's got for it.

204
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:15,200
And he says, a boggy, soggy, squinchy picture, truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted.

205
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,960
Well, that's just a pointing ahead.

206
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:23,679
There is a nervous man in the book who is completely distracted by things he can't get a grip on and understand.

207
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:29,279
And of course, that's A, who even says that he wants a solid grip in this slippery world.

208
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:31,279
Well, this is not a solid grip.

209
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,799
There was, but he loves it.

210
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:47,359
Yet there was a sort of indefinite, half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that froze you to it till you took an oath with yourself to find out what the marvelous painting meant.

211
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:50,559
And then he goes through this game of interpretation.

212
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:58,000
Every, ever and anon, a bright but alas deceptive idea would dart through you.

213
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,160
It's the Black Sea in a midnight gale.

214
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,200
It's the unnatural combat of the four primal elements.

215
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,720
It's a blasted heat.

216
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,279
It's a horborean winter scene.

217
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:08,240
It's the breakup.

218
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,039
This is my favorite.

219
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,000
It's the breakup of the ice-bound stream of time.

220
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Go far and further out.

221
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,039
But at last, all these fantasies yield to one portentous something in the picture.

222
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,399
That once found out, all the rest were plain.

223
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:22,960
But stop.

224
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,559
Does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish?

225
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,519
Even the great Leviathan himself?

226
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:36,000
In fact, the artist designed, seemed this, a final theory of my own, and so forth.

227
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,359
So, one, he says it's a whale, but he also says it's just the way it seems to him.

228
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,119
It's his theory that it's a whale.

229
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:44,919
He's got all the pieces in there.

230
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:48,839
And moreover, it turns out the whale has no face, so you couldn't really paint the whale.

231
00:22:49,160 --> 00:23:00,279
You can't paint the whale, he says later, as it is under the water, and you can't paint the whale as it is when it's out of the water, because then it's just a kind of floppy mess and it ceases to look like a whale.

232
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:10,519
So that's okay, that's the first version of the game of interpretation, which the book is all structured by.

233
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:17,720
And he's got these playful interpretations, and he says it's his own, it's what he thinks.

234
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:29,399
So the whale, in its ungraspableness, and even more of the white whale, become symbols of the inscrutability of the universe.

235
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,399
And we get from the very beginning every possible interpretation.

236
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:45,799
And now we see this funny thing in the book where he collects at the beginning the extracts supplied by a sub-sub-librarian, these higgly-piggly gospel zetology, all funny ways of talking.

237
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:54,759
I mean, zetology is science, but it's gospel zetology, but it's not reliable at all, and it's got all kinds of crazy stuff in it.

238
00:23:54,759 --> 00:24:09,559
And it's collected in he gives you biblical quotes, poetic quotes, mythical quotes, scientific quotes, completely nutty quotes, because these are all supposed to be quotes about the whale.

239
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:19,079
And then, if you read them, which you probably don't need to, all of a sudden, having had the whale did this, the whale did that, the whale did that, each separate quote.

240
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:25,079
Here's a a quote: If you make the least damn bit of noise, replied Samuel, I'll send you to hell.

241
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:27,000
Life of Samuel Comstock.

242
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,879
Just in there, a quote which hasn't even got a whale in it.

243
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:35,279
So, and all of this is this kind of randomness, which he plays with.

244
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,559
And that's it.

245
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:49,600
Now, and it takes a long time for him to explain more and more about how the whale is the unrepresentable, to talk like philosophy.

246
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:59,599
You can't draw it, you can't describe it, it's got marks on it that you can't decipher, it makes gestures with its tail that you can't understand, it has no face, and so forth.

247
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:04,319
But now I want to stop that, although it'll come back again and again.

248
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:15,759
And you who know more about the course already know that the whiteness of Moby Dick is the culmination of all this side of the whale.

249
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:38,879
But now, the basic dichotomy of the book, which some one of you mentioned already, the sea and the land, is the way he expresses, on the one hand, the indeterminate chaos, and on the other hand, the need for something solid, something that you can take a stand on and count on, and so forth.

250
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:47,200
And he does it by just contrasting the land and the sea for pages and pages and all through the book.

251
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,639
But I will just read you and give you a list.

252
00:25:53,599 --> 00:26:00,799
If I were writing it all on the board, which I won't because there's nobody here very few anyway, you've all got it to copy down.

253
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,639
I can give you a copy.

254
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:11,039
So, but I would have a big list of land versus sea, and here is a bunch of them for you out there in podcast land.

255
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:14,599
I'll give you always land and then sea.

256
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,880
Land is closed, closed off.

257
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:19,480
The sea is open.

258
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:21,240
The land is marked off.

259
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,919
There are landmarks.

260
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,960
The sea leaves no records.

261
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:32,839
To take just when he goes to sea, for instance, just to not just keep reading, but interrupt this every once in a while.

262
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:42,200
He says, gaining the open water, the wind blew, he's going off in the tugboat toward the Pequad.

263
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,240
How I snuff that tartar air, how I spurned the turnpike earth.

264
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,359
That's the slavish marked off.

265
00:26:50,359 --> 00:27:02,519
That common highway, all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs, and how I turn me to admire the magnanimity of the sea, which will permit no records.

266
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:04,359
See, no landmarks.

267
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:19,480
So then you've heard it's slavish, the land, the sea is freedom, the land is certainty, the sea is mystery, there's comfort versus rigor, safety versus danger, solid ground versus bottomless, that's a nice one.

268
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:30,839
I mean, there are landmarks, but there are no sea marks, and there's a bottom, and you stand on the land, but you don't stand on the bottom of the ocean.

269
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:35,000
And then there's the definite, that's very important, and the indefinite.

270
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,879
I'll read you a sentence for that, because one of his favorite things is the indefinite.

271
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,119
If there were ever a God, that would be indefinite for him.

272
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:48,519
He says, but in landlessness alone resides the highest truth.

273
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,240
Sh, shoreless, indefinite is God.

274
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:56,839
So it's the definite versus indefinite, bounded versus boundless.

275
00:27:56,839 --> 00:28:04,240
I like that because I want the whale to be the symbol of the sea is the unrepresentable.

276
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:12,240
The whale is kind of the incarnation or mammalization or something of the sea.

277
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,919
It's focused in the whale, the sperm whale particularly.

278
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,240
And then the white whale is the most extreme of all these things.

279
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:28,960
But so there's this little, at the end of all these funny extracts, which I have read you only the craziest, the last one is the most important.

280
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:39,279
Oh, the rare old whale mid storm and gale in his ocean home will be a giant in might where might is right and king of the boundless sea.

281
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:44,159
So that's to say he's the exemplar of the paradigm of the boundless.

282
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:50,480
And he's another thing is his distinction the land is finite, the sea is infinite.

283
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,240
It's not quite clear what that means, but you've got the general idea.

284
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:07,200
He talks about, we'll see again how at sea you could perish in the howling infinite, and how that would be better than to be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if it were safe.

285
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:16,959
And he contrasts philosophy and which goes with land and thinking or meditation, which goes with sea.

286
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,319
Those are those two extreme attitudes.

287
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:23,119
And now I see if I skipped anything.

288
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:32,480
Well, everybody has got a certain cautious attraction to the sea because the land is so constricting, according to the way he s sets it up.

289
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:42,519
So everybody wants to get as close to the water as possible and yet not fall in.

290
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,839
And he talks about that.

291
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:51,079
And he talks about this tendency to try to get everything clear and determinate.

292
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:54,120
And I'm going to talk about that now.

293
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:57,639
There's this tendency to try to grasp the meaning once and for all.

294
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,920
And that's what philosophy and religion try to do.

295
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:06,200
And we saw that at its best in Dante.

296
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:12,359
But his way of talking, he thinks it's very dangerous to try to grasp it once and for all.

297
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:16,119
And he thinks that the myth of narcissist is about that.

298
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:29,720
He says on page three, about the deeper meaning of that story of narcissists, who, because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it, was drowned.

299
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,480
But that same image we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans.

300
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:39,000
And it's the image of the ungraspable phantom of life, and this is the key to it all.

301
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,039
This whole, I don't know, again, you look puzzled, this very sort of puzzling.

302
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:52,439
But the drift of it is that most people try to get an answer, and that's disaster.

303
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,039
And that's what happened, and that's what Narcissus shows.

304
00:30:56,039 --> 00:31:01,000
But his hero is going to stand in the howling infinite.

305
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,319
We'll talk about that more in a minute.

306
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:08,599
You shouldn't be trying to grasp the final meaning and truth.

307
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:11,720
Of course, Ahab is dedicated.

308
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:23,079
That's his life obsession to forcing the universe to give him an answer to whether there's a God and whether God is malicious or good and so forth.

309
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:28,119
And that's all going to turn out to be disastrous in ways I can't tell you about yet.

310
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:33,840
And I just wanted to say, it struck me as interesting that Homer loves light and clarity.

311
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:43,279
The Odyssey is so clear and so beautiful, and every chair and every dish and every person is outlined in absolute clarity.

312
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:51,360
And Poseidon, who is the dark side, the water side, is played down in the Odyssey.

313
00:31:51,359 --> 00:32:00,799
He's the sort of outlier of the pantheon who they don't usually get along with, but since he's the brother of Zeus, they have to deal with him.

314
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,279
But Zeus is superior to Poseidon.

315
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:10,720
But it's, and for Melville, as you can imagine, what makes the sea so special is that it's dark.

316
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,960
And darkness is more important than light to him.

317
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,319
It's just as it should be, in a way.

318
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:25,679
He says on page 52: it's as if darkness were the proper element of our essences.

319
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:33,839
It's a very anti-philosophical, anti-Western, anti-Greek idea that darkness is superior to light.

320
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:38,000
Now, people are constantly trying to turn the ocean into the land.

321
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,879
And that's where the people from Nantucket come in.

322
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,720
And I try to go quick over them.

323
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:50,319
I said more about them in the lecture, but we don't really need to know too much, except that Ahab is from Nantucket.

324
00:32:50,319 --> 00:33:02,639
And the Nantucket people, I quote on 61, issuing from their anthill in the sea, overrun and conquer the watery globe, like so many Alexanders.

325
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:10,000
Two-thirds of this globe, this terraquatous globe, boy, terraquacious.

326
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,519
What in the way?

327
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:12,319
It's a mixture of land and water?

328
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:13,279
I don't know what that means.

329
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:18,279
Two-thirds of this terraquatous globe, well, I see we are a mixture.

330
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:20,600
The globe is some land and some water.

331
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:20,919
Okay.

332
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,039
Are the Nantucketers, for the sea is his.

333
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:25,480
He owns it.

334
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,960
He goes to the sea, there is his home.

335
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,559
There is his business.

336
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:34,039
He lives on the sea like the prairie cocks in the prairie and so forth.

337
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:46,039
It's just important to know that there is this kind of technological force of taming and making objects out of and getting control of everything.

338
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:49,879
And the Nantucketers are the ones who do that.

339
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:59,559
He's got a sense that everything, that science and technology will get rid of all the dark, try to get rid of all the darkness and all the mystery.

340
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:04,760
And for instance, he has a sense, I couldn't turn to it, but he talks about this frigate Earth.

341
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:21,800
I think he's probably the first person I'd love to know who thinks of the Earth as an object, a spaceship, in effect, and sees that it's been objectified by, and the Nantucketers are sort of doing the same job.

342
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:31,800
Now, the last important thing, I promise to tell you more about the openness and the groundlessness.

343
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,239
And maybe I didn't promise, but that's what's coming up.

344
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:46,039
And the right way to relate to them, almost right, except that it isn't the right way because it isn't this getting in tune with the sacred and getting healed.

345
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:46,679
You'll see.

346
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:51,480
It's a fascinating, weird feature of this book, which is full of fascinating, weird features.

347
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,159
One feels that Melville couldn't possibly have understood what he was doing.

348
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,000
That's what makes it such a great book.

349
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:03,920
He must have just got up in the morning and started writing and was totally blown away by what he had written.

350
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,720
Okay, so here we go for that, for what I call heroic nihilism.

351
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:25,360
The other attitude from trying to turn the sea into the land is to accept the groundlessness and enjoy the constant challenge and constantly avoid the temptation to try to grasp it and make sense of it.

352
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,400
And there is a hero who does that.

353
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:45,840
And it looks like somebody who did that would be able to rejoice in their freedom because they will certainly have total freedom and they ought to enjoy the play of perspectives and they should certainly stand firm against the temptation to settle for any fixed answers.

354
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:58,880
And now he's going to give you a hero who is, you'll see in a minute, I mean, that he has, that he's able to stand against the temptation of fixed answers is sure.

355
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,960
That he enjoys it and rejoices in it is not the case for Melville.

356
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,559
I mean, those who any of you know Nietzsche, I mean, always in the back of my mind, I have Nietzsche.

357
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,600
You recognize some of this Nietzschean thing.

358
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,199
I mean, this is the overman in Nietzschean turns.

359
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,680
So let's find out about him.

360
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:30,960
There is this fascinating, handsome man who appears on page 14, and he has a sober face.

361
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:38,399
He's very good looking, s full six feet in height, with noble shoulders, uh a chest like a cofferdam.

362
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:52,840
I've seldom seen such a brawn and such brawn in man, a face deeply brown and burnt, marked with dazzling white teeth by contrast, while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.

363
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,920
That's the interesting thing.

364
00:36:55,239 --> 00:37:00,680
The way he differs from Nietzsche is he doesn't think heroic nihilism can be joyful.

365
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:15,800
But the man disappears unobserved when everybody else is having a good time and they all run after him saying, Baltington, Baltington, and that's but we don't see him anymore for a long, long time until page 101.

366
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:30,840
And 101, they go they set out from Nantucket to the and the great line, we gave three heavy-hearted cheers and blindly plunged like fate into the lone Atlantic.

367
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,039
And now they're off.

368
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:35,240
And what does he see at the helm of the boat?

369
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:36,519
Baltington.

370
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:46,280
When on that shivering winter's night the Pequod thrust her vindictive bows into the cold, malicious waves, who should I see standing at her helm but Baltington?

371
00:37:46,280 --> 00:38:00,760
I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man who in midwinter, just landed from a four years dangerous voyage, could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term.

372
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,320
The land seems scorching to his feet.

373
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:10,440
That is, that he can't stand these certainties and these happy parties and and so forth.

374
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:15,159
And now this is how he describes the way the wor the way it seems to Baltington.

375
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:18,280
The port would fain give fain give succor.

376
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,960
The port is pitiful.

377
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,319
In the port is safe oh, the port is, yeah, pitiful.

378
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:29,280
In the port in the port is safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends.

379
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,760
All is kind to our mortalities.

380
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:38,799
In the course is the, well, never mind.

381
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,079
That list is important.

382
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:40,799
I wish I had.

383
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,400
Well, I can remember.

384
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,839
So here, let's go on.

385
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:48,639
But in that gale, the port, the land, is that ship's direst jeopardy.

386
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:50,799
She must fly all hospitality.

387
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,079
One touch of land would make her shudder through and through.

388
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,280
With all her might, she crowds offshore.

389
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,600
All the land seeks all the lashed sea's landlessness again.

390
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,239
Okay, that's the picture of how it looks to Baltington.

391
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:14,320
And then comes this amazing two paragraphs where you get the essence of what it would be like to be at sea all the time.

392
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:35,360
Know ye now, Baltington, glimpses do you seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth that all deep earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea, while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous slavish shore.

393
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:45,039
Now, now, this comes this praise of Baltington, but in landlessness alone resides the highest truth, shoreless, indefinite as God.

394
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:51,840
So better it is to perish in the howling infinite than being gloriously dashed upon the leaf, even if it were safe.

395
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:56,800
Take heart, take heart, O Baltington, bear thee grimly, demigod.

396
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:03,120
Up from the spray of thy ocean perishing, leaps straight up thy apotheosis.

397
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,000
One or two.

398
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,120
What an amazing thing.

399
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:12,239
And you just discover that Baltington drops dead that night.

400
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:13,639
We don't know why.

401
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,399
He's never mentioned again in the book.

402
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:23,880
He's become a god, so that up from his ocean perishing, his apotheosis is godlike.

403
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:35,559
But I think the interesting thing is, Melville pictures what it would be like to live this heroic nihilist life that Nietzsche admires too very much.

404
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:42,920
And Melville thinks that it would be grim and joyless, and he doesn't buy it.

405
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,559
He doesn't see why we should have.

406
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:52,760
He thinks we are, I don't know whether we are incapable of it, or I guess at least this, we don't have to settle for this.

407
00:40:52,760 --> 00:41:04,760
And though he admires Bulkington, obviously amazingly, he's the, if God is dead, we have to become gods ourselves, Nietzsche says, and Balkington does it.

408
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:13,400
He thinks that there must be some other way to heal us besides, and he just dumps Balkington.

409
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,279
And we never hear from him again after that paragraph.

410
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,720
Do you want to say something?

411
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:18,920
Oh, okay.

412
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:24,120
So, you have to resist all the answers.

413
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:29,079
And so, God for Melville, remember, indefinite is God.

414
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:30,200
What does that mean?

415
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:37,160
God is not the supreme being that's ground of all intelligibility and explains everything.

416
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:39,640
God is the groundlessness.

417
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:45,640
It is the indefiniteness which makes everything endlessly interpretable.

418
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:49,400
That's another way of saying the same thing I was saying.

419
00:41:53,159 --> 00:42:01,280
But just living in the groundlessness, like Balkington, isn't somehow satisfying.

420
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,760
It doesn't give you the healing you need.

421
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:09,200
It's not enough to be the lieutenant of nothingness, which is a Heidegger phrase for this thing.

422
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:14,000
It's a grim job, and that's about all that he has to say about it.

423
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:18,240
I think I have read all the quotes that I need to quote for that.

424
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:24,960
So there's a truth, it's a truth, this heroic nihilism.

425
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:40,880
It's a truth that it's all bottomless and ungrounded and non-representable, and can't, and that is a truth that just like that, no normal mortal human being can tolerate it.

426
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,400
That's what Balkington is supposed to be.

427
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,880
It's like Leitzene, Nietzsche.

428
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:55,280
Because Nietzsche says all these things about the Oberman, the free spirit, that sound just like Balkington, except Nietzsche keeps telling you he's joyful.

429
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:01,519
And I think Melville wants to say he's pictured him, and he's not joyful.

430
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:04,320
He's grim, and we don't want to be like that.

431
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:08,079
And I think that's a great move on Melville's part.

432
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:16,559
So the Oberman is grim and perishes in the Holy Infinite, and that's that.

433
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,519
That is, there is this extreme possibility of the absence of all meaning.

434
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,559
Don't even trust any divine glimmers.

435
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:28,880
Take no comfort from any interpretation.

436
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,640
Confront the indefinite head-on.

437
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:43,400
You'd have no hierarchies, no center, no even gods, no meaning, no land, and that's just not going to work.

438
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,640
And so Balkington is never mentioned again.

439
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,320
But then this is the last thing to say for this lecture.

440
00:43:52,039 --> 00:44:06,519
But if we've rejected onto theology on the one hand, which is the land and the, so to speak, the religions that have an answer, and we rejected heroic nihilism, so what can heal us?

441
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:12,600
A lot of the rest of the book is about what can heal us, what can save us in the end.

442
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:19,080
And his answer really is: it's going to be a kind of polytheism.

443
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:25,240
I didn't expect to read this to you, but I feel it's so interesting and important.

444
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:29,640
Yes, I just opened to it, probably because I look at it every once in a while.

445
00:44:29,639 --> 00:45:11,559
Because I was just, when I said it was polytheistic as I was reading it, because of the moods and all that, I never would have believed that Melville would just say it, but on 336, if hereafter a highly cultured, poetical nation shall lure back to their birthright the Merry May Day gods of old, though that's the pantheon, and lie and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky, that means the sky that's become just our technological sort of projection.

446
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:18,079
In the now unhaunted hill, that is the hill that's, the phrase he's unhaunted?

447
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:18,759
Is his phrase.

448
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,200
The famous phrase from Weber is the disenchanted.

449
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:25,039
So disenchanted nature.

450
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:34,639
Then, to be sure, exalted to Jove's high seat, Zeus's high seat, the great sperm whale shall lord it.

451
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,720
So the picture is that where does the meaning come from?

452
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:54,720
Instead of standing in Allen Gale of the Infinite, it comes from a pantheon of moods or gods in which there is the ultimate God, namely Zeus, who isn't representable.

453
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:56,720
He's like Moby Dick.

454
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:04,480
To the people who've had the Course, you will recognize this isn't Homer's God, since you can sort of see and hear Zeus and so forth.

455
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:09,839
This is Aeschylus' God, where Aeschylus says that he doesn't know what God is.

456
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,640
God is sort of what's behind everything.

457
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,320
It never comes into the light.

458
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,519
That's Melville's understanding.

459
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:21,759
So you'll get a pantheon of gods.

460
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,160
You'll get a spectrum of moods, which he compares to the rainbow.

461
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:30,000
You get as much meaning as you can from all of them.

462
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:38,400
And you preserve them by seeing God is the indefinite, the boundless, the unrepresentable.

463
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,960
Okay, now I've done my job of catching up on the lecture.

464
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,639
Thank you all for coming.
