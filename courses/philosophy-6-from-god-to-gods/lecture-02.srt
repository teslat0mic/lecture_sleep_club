1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,921
People keep talking on their minds that I give them to why does this work of why why have a work of art that it articulates and holds up to the culture if they've all got into their bodies anyway?

2
00:00:14,241 --> 00:00:24,000
Well, because the work of art makes it more articulated, more glamorized, why that's how people got that's not probably quite right or for.

3
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:36,880
But if you have to sort of if it's not you wouldn't have to preserve, we cultivate, there wouldn't be any reason why you didn't preserve it.

4
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:52,241
But since it is just the practice of people culture, if there isn't something that holds up glamorizing the colours development department, Greek students love to be normally Greece, but yet he is far as we glamorize the owner.

5
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,520
It's just a way that for them, all of his life was final for us.

6
00:00:57,521 --> 00:01:11,120
It was something that they decided to simply all with Jews to figure out what to do, to understand what was excellent, so that they had a kind of model of what excellent wise was.

7
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,560
Servants, you'll see there's a perfect model serving in there, and a model wife, that would be modern model father.

8
00:01:18,881 --> 00:01:26,080
There's a model of every particular role because that policy of active policy would have been all of it yet.

9
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:28,961
So that's why it's not enough world.

10
00:01:28,961 --> 00:01:30,720
So so let's go on.

11
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:33,920
Today I'll talk about why we call it.

12
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:37,600
Let's go on into what role the gods have.

13
00:01:37,601 --> 00:01:40,160
So, roughly these were the listeners.

14
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:49,081
But this this falls of a harbor, as it's called, or the the internet is called the the gods who's pointed in the book.

15
00:01:49,081 --> 00:01:57,881
But then if people think it's Homer putting himself into his own story, if there's this one person who was home, he just nobody can tell us the story.

16
00:01:57,881 --> 00:02:11,641
It's a story but the perfect picture of what what is going on that is going on several hundred years, then another maybe uh six hundred was the time of Esther.

17
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:28,280
But even then, they were still appealing to Homer and knew it most everybody knew large parts of the gods and the other part and they appealed to it to settle moral or legal or diplomatic dispute and hold it really achieved.

18
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:46,281
So that's because again this glorifies unified picture of what they were once upon a time up to and still wanted to produce in the Homer does it or what does their policy Homer makes up this story.

19
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:58,600
I mean apparently it wasn't all people finally interested that were deep force got this kind of goddesses called the Furies, who were the goddess of the dentist.

20
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,761
And Homer just ruled them out.

21
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:06,120
He just to make up this story towards only the home to go build.

22
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,801
You'll see in that book you read, if the Furies really are terribly upset to take that rule.

23
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:19,400
And they're making a lot of trouble because it wasn't it wasn't uh what Homer prophetic say why?

24
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:36,641
Well, a view of a few are kind of rel polytheistic religion well of which it's a number of certain ways of thinking there are gods of God's state that nonetheless have a family resemblance and complicated relationship that Palmer's worked out.

25
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:38,560
Or well invented somewhere.

26
00:03:38,641 --> 00:03:46,641
He focused on things to make not only do we part of a whole heresy that we thought the whole way to live.

27
00:03:46,641 --> 00:03:54,161
And so part of the moral of the course I participated on it look us away is well they knew something to us.

28
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,000
Of course we know a lot more.

29
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,201
Not why they know this, but what it is to be a people.

30
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:02,961
They knew some things that we know a lot more or what it is a lot more.

31
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,560
Some stuff that we know more.

32
00:04:06,561 --> 00:04:09,440
Things alter the case that they knew a lot more than we did.

33
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:16,961
Well it is a factor's fact that might be a good idea.

34
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:20,160
If that no delivers Movie lift.

35
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:35,440
That's why we will both the gods of old and if they did mostly do but the idea that there's something that Palmer see that we lost touch with is something that I don't know how any books have said this.

36
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:39,040
If you do let me know that that's what I think was that's what I think.

37
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,240
So why not?

38
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:48,321
Well because Palmer's got something that we have lost that if we had it we could get it all.

39
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:53,201
And of course if you're reading Homer at the Great Book, you'll miss that.

40
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:58,240
Because you think, well, it's an attempt to talk about remember the story of books being booked.

41
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:06,160
If we sort of as if literature and Black Einstein's, we know a lot more about electronics and about Lord than the Homer people.

42
00:05:06,321 --> 00:05:07,521
Palmer misses a lot.

43
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,001
All of his resolves is just one whoa.

44
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,081
Uh, okay, uh, all of it.

45
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:34,680
So here's an authority on Greek culture at Oxford, I think, or maybe Cambridge anyway, about fifty years ago, saying that by all is given guess, uh, we believe that a man's justice is from throwing the situation to his own will, through his own power.

46
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,160
Remember all this about giving commonism.

47
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,680
To choose what to do and then do it on your own, that's by your will.

48
00:05:42,681 --> 00:05:46,521
So each of them wants to explain the source of an incidental strength.

49
00:05:46,521 --> 00:05:50,521
He has no force but to say that the responsibility lies with the gods.

50
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,521
The same is true in other cases.

51
00:05:52,521 --> 00:06:07,160
Whenever a man composes or pronounces more than his previous attitude has led others to expect, Palmer connects this insofar as he tries to supply an explanation with the interference, with the interference of the gods.

52
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:11,961
He should be noted, especially that Almer does not know the other personal decisions.

53
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:17,881
Even where he always goes and pondering to alternatives, the intervention of the gods plays the key role.

54
00:06:17,881 --> 00:06:19,801
Well, one, it's just plain wrong.

55
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:27,721
When we get to a place where Ogistus has to constitute it all by himself, he says, why weren't you encompassing it?

56
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,040
He had to figure it out himself.

57
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,480
So this is just wrong.

58
00:06:32,201 --> 00:06:39,160
Whether this is what what happens with the limitists is that he isn't able to act on his own will.

59
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:43,161
It's just the whole interest will.

60
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:49,001
That the whole thing of what you need to do is do and why he doesn't do it is doing this and is not the case and we'll reflect.

61
00:06:49,001 --> 00:06:52,441
And then having the data is there, Paul says things wrong.

62
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,201
Palmer has known liver effect.

63
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:56,241
He has a much more interesting.

64
00:06:55,881 --> 00:07:00,480
But we'll we have to wait till we get to surrender this and it's hard to hear.

65
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:07,441
I know it must why would that be when I broke down this last year and I looked up it's not, you know, I just told that last time.

66
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:09,841
I could help that look up.

67
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,681
But right.

68
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:22,400
I said, oh well, okay, so the good both people can try to tell us kind of we're autonomous self-directed agents responsible for what we do and so forth.

69
00:07:22,561 --> 00:07:26,881
Palmer has to go from the point of view we don't declare.

70
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:31,840
Uh because we all sort of lost faith in Christ.

71
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,400
And we're no longer so convinced that we're unified.

72
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:40,160
I think all the discoveries that are postmodernist non-spel put himself.

73
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,480
We're still thinking that he must have to do our one say Friday.

74
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:59,761
So I these people want more things anyway they say good good book and they say you've got a lot of clarity, wisdom, he appreciates curiosity, that all that sort of it's like he was a kind of funny life.

75
00:07:59,761 --> 00:08:05,280
But according to the question is saying, what is it that uh Palmer speaks wrong?

76
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:12,241
Well to begin with, we've got there's a different understanding of the plurality of times of good.

77
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:24,241
Uh that you'll see when you read it, that God is so God has something which is that they're very good at the guidance of gold times or seeing it and so forth.

78
00:08:24,641 --> 00:08:29,840
The other guy has always the rational, theoretical ones and the clarity.

79
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:41,481
Palmer doesn't feel any need to rank them or to tell you which of these literatures are really good good and which ones you know are somehow dangerous or viewers.

80
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:46,840
This is part of the way that the good one gets the plurality of goods all together under one good.

81
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:47,800
Watch them all.

82
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,321
It will tell you all of these things.

83
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,601
So that's one of the parts: to figure out what the really good is and then subordinate to them.

84
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:07,561
So we want to know too what aspects of human life that we neglect to don't think is important to express a richer and more diverse world.

85
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,721
Again, I can sort of spin it now.

86
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:22,041
So if you get one of those things, things always want a margin of our experience, I mean, up or that we don't pay much attention to, is the force of mood.

87
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:25,401
There was a reader that is what you read.

88
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,760
These people are artists that left off that list because they're feeling that's a wrong.

89
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:34,121
This is a false world dog.

90
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,240
He is good at going from world to world.

91
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:43,321
This is the virgin spot of life and cleverly getting stuff out of every time.

92
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:50,920
And work of artist folks is what this part is doing was times when they were worked of art, were works of art.

93
00:09:50,921 --> 00:09:56,281
Philosophers think we focused the whole culture with life.

94
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,840
So there were works of art.

95
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,801
One, after these likeness areas, or works of art.

96
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:06,520
I think moreover, there's nobody once, and this may be coming back what we said.

97
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,241
We want to read this a world.

98
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:15,561
And we want to read this book and both because it's fo one reason because it's focused in the world.

99
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,840
Happens to be two things different.

100
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,641
One is that we're watching how it focus is a world with a lover and so forth.

101
00:10:23,961 --> 00:10:29,600
So with how it's doing its work of art work, which is the work of art work of the art.

102
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,721
And then what is it we're doing?

103
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:43,601
It is we're looking at that particular world that Homer is poems that start talking about and living or how important these things are.

104
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:50,961
So we're looking at we're looking at the function of folks in the world and we're looking at students of worlds that just focus this is the first of them.

105
00:10:53,681 --> 00:10:55,361
Moves are just kind of like people.

106
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,201
He's still got a chance with the friends who come in and a move.

107
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:04,641
Because a movie is something that's not developing people like covers their whole world.

108
00:11:04,641 --> 00:11:07,201
I think it's the whole world.

109
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,561
So Homer's got a strong chance to color the whole world.

110
00:11:12,561 --> 00:11:17,600
And he's moved out of people that don't have to keep that straight exactly.

111
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,561
Our great poets and artists will be thinking the part he is good.

112
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:26,161
Melanio is a good poet and thinker.

113
00:11:26,161 --> 00:11:27,201
And he has that.

114
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,441
That's why he's waiting for the young son.

115
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,001
There's some way in which the enlightenment is, you know, you've got to experience your world.

116
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,600
It's like home.

117
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:42,721
Makes it remarkable in our world, but with this world that senses like moves.

118
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,840
And what a difference that would make to come to life if you understood that.

119
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,240
Uh live like that.

120
00:11:50,561 --> 00:11:53,600
I guess Laura said we have to read this book first.

121
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,840
But um point the lenses.

122
00:11:55,921 --> 00:12:05,041
We have all sorts of very well have sort of been put in medieval but there's simply with the word it's, don't know several different words, worlds.

123
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:08,961
There's the world of sort of early Christian gifts, the window of that.

124
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:14,521
Then there's the world of medieval Christian, maybe the world of early kind of world.

125
00:12:14,921 --> 00:12:20,201
It was getting worse to God or uh milk and flaws.

126
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:38,360
We won't predict the course that works well, but well, yeah, hold up to account what the idea of these possibilities to put in all you know, I think he really thinks he was so radical that he just made up all identities.

127
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:43,001
And one of the one who said the cancer that said, What is going to work on something or other?

128
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,840
Kill any parts, take along, and work the bars for all this.

129
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:57,961
And legitimately, he's supposed to look afford and find bones confidential, which it looks like they're different to us.

130
00:12:57,961 --> 00:12:59,321
Which one is there?

131
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:10,600
And if there's a reason that is so radical that nobody can understand what they're up to, including things, one of the things I've started putting under system is up to focus is there on fixed one.

132
00:13:10,681 --> 00:13:23,961
It takes a palmer, it takes a bit of far fit, which is if people think that you know, it's supposed to be the ball, the young war, the prime, but you don't necessarily work that poverty is the alias.

133
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:48,440
The eyes are all taking various sides, but it's not clear because sort of the implications of the illias, let's suppose this is sort of disclosed, then they work at which one of the favors of these, why, so anyway, there's trust for him against the world as well, and they've also that it who comes along after the world in nature.

134
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:55,441
I mean, okay, that's you know, of course, but it's it's not off the course, it's been um words.

135
00:13:55,441 --> 00:14:00,321
Oh, well, okay, now that God's back for people, how different they are.

136
00:14:00,321 --> 00:14:06,880
You feel more at all in all of his world than in the world of the medieval Christians.

137
00:14:06,961 --> 00:14:24,801
They like us appreciate beautiful, well-made weatherness, they speak with honesty, they loyalty, and they have these wonderful dinner parties, and then they they they're also very interesting where they uh uh tell us opium in there.

138
00:14:24,801 --> 00:14:26,001
They get a joke.

139
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:37,201
They come into their voice and they get their hotels and they all act out terrible and then of course we've got our our uh phones.

140
00:14:37,201 --> 00:14:47,201
Well, we've got our doctors by Bolax Johan, who in the 70s anyway, so it certainly told us what what we were up to and what the move was and so forth.

141
00:14:47,201 --> 00:14:56,241
And maybe somebody's doing it now, maybe talking about some poets who pulled up for us the sort of wind-up for us what's going on.

142
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,041
It also might be all sorts of scary things.

143
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:02,401
Uh, but now we can't do this.

144
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:07,361
But then come to the side of the gods, the drunk being seen so uncommon.

145
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,201
They weren't just decorated, they took them very seriously.

146
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:16,801
They weren't living on the Olympus in the sense that you find up Olympus and they do strange things.

147
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:27,041
Once you get into the goddamn state of the home, we see very strange gods impersonate other people, they just hide themselves, they fight with each other.

148
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:30,840
I mean, angels, for instance, don't go and impersonate people.

149
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:35,720
Or, or at very rarely that's what maybe it is already in the total of these stuff.

150
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:39,760
It's of this topic, but most readings, all of which the cobbler has got.

151
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:55,720
So it's very hard to see how a bunch of people so much like us about this area of their lives, so far from having the past, they see things in a way that we don't, that the gods.

152
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:58,360
Okay, well, one more thing, which you're going to hear a lot about.

153
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:04,121
We think about what people believe, we think about their willpower, we think about their desire.

154
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,001
Oh, wow, that's going to be something people start to find by this design.

155
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:12,041
That certainly is not, well, I'll come back to that.

156
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:22,360
So when people write about the Greeks again, they say they try to, Homer is a college, but what Homer thought was going on.

157
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,721
Homer has designed his god in a book called Greeks in the Around.

158
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:50,520
He says we have surveyed the common trip to try this again for them and often resolve that in all the parties of normal human behavior whose causes are not a reason for feeling, whether by the subject's own consciousness, they wouldn't attract individuals, and they wouldn't have understood, I think, if you thought about their own consciousness.

159
00:16:50,841 --> 00:16:59,800
Whether because they thought, I think, that they were open head towards the world, which is what we always see, that's why we get back to touch with this.

160
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,080
It isn't going, well, what's going on in here isn't going on the side of your head.

161
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:15,160
It must get away of your being open to the world and open to what is by the stresses of describing these psychic states.

162
00:17:15,161 --> 00:17:17,961
He says, American steps.

163
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,160
Well, people in Born now are stepped forward.

164
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,800
What's those who think about the ideas we have?

165
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:28,081
But he said that women also have to head with grass degrees.

166
00:17:28,161 --> 00:17:30,640
They're not eliminated from their national evidence.

167
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:33,041
The links were born on a primitive path.

168
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:36,641
Well, that's a long way to look.

169
00:17:36,641 --> 00:17:37,760
It's not as good.

170
00:17:37,841 --> 00:17:42,560
If the gods are that odds are doing something else, so now it's time to figure out what that is.

171
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:49,681
But first, dealing with worlds, the medieval world, or the world of the war world.

172
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:51,921
That it's not innovative.

173
00:17:51,921 --> 00:18:00,401
Helen reads the her husband her newborn child and runs off with her but welcome born.

174
00:18:00,401 --> 00:18:02,240
That's nobody.

175
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,961
Nobody's going to it's it's ontology, it's not psychology.

176
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,441
Nobody's going to watch this dream of it.

177
00:18:09,441 --> 00:18:11,441
He thought going off in Paris.

178
00:18:11,441 --> 00:18:12,720
It wasn't like that at all.

179
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:20,161
The only thing was that the ride watches the war and I was that is what that what needed to be done at that point.

180
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:28,640
So I want to just give you a hint that it's you're going to be will be not a psychology however, but this uh world.

181
00:18:29,681 --> 00:18:32,961
So I have a bunch of questions to get to philanthropy.

182
00:18:33,201 --> 00:18:37,120
Uh so let's go to talking about philanthropy.

183
00:18:37,121 --> 00:18:48,001
Because the things I've been telling you will get a lot more the way I'm trying to read it will get a lot more time to give it up like that and the rest of you before I talk about that.

184
00:18:48,000 --> 00:19:00,360
So really what first time before we talked about science and getting science back if it also wants to mark it up so when you lose you do, listen to the class and we have to look for it.

185
00:19:00,361 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah, but anyway, once this is a first time through, we just work for war.

186
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,401
So you don't have to read any more yet.

187
00:19:08,401 --> 00:19:10,560
I don't think let me look at lectures through it.

188
00:19:10,641 --> 00:19:24,681
Well, to begin with, let's see what the length is ignoring, we know that because he was born just before Odysseus went to the war about Croat and gets into techniques getting home.

189
00:19:24,681 --> 00:19:31,081
So roughly, he's going all in line with his father, Dawn, with his father.

190
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,961
But draw out his kind of the pet of the of the students.

191
00:19:35,961 --> 00:19:42,681
He's a king, sort of looking athletic, old enough.

192
00:19:42,921 --> 00:19:49,240
He's there the first sort of psychological story that he could say.

193
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,600
Well, he's there.

194
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:58,441
He's daydreaming and sorry for himself.

195
00:19:58,441 --> 00:20:03,720
And he's in teaches that what happened.

196
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,880
Okay, that's a little what happened if he draw any of those feed issues going on.

197
00:20:08,681 --> 00:20:10,601
So what's going to happen to him?

198
00:20:10,601 --> 00:20:17,640
He's going to go from being non-income and finally feeling sorry for the dump.

199
00:20:17,881 --> 00:20:21,240
He's going to go to see how Homer describes.

200
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:27,961
So I think that's the sort of remember the page says, oh, did we get to put more spurs into the subject?

201
00:20:28,201 --> 00:20:29,880
How could you follow up on the strand?

202
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:31,160
Hurry business away.

203
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:34,040
I'll just say it's plenty of time, which I will agree.

204
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,681
Anybody really don't know about this.

205
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:41,800
What I do is I look at all the other samples until I find one that says more what I think only for the state.

206
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,040
And that algorithm has the news.

207
00:20:44,121 --> 00:20:45,561
Nothing like birds.

208
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,281
He's turned up.

209
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,600
I know that it's my home over my life is fairly walking.

210
00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:53,640
So they would have some fun with these owners that I switched.

211
00:20:53,641 --> 00:21:03,760
Also, just because it says, long before anyone else for Prince Telemetus now last night has been there, or he's who was sitting there unhappy among his food and a boy.

212
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,921
It's important that he's a boy.

213
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:09,360
And he's never had a father and he's never had to face any problems.

214
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:16,161
He's thinking, what if his grandfather came from the unknown world and drove him on his lordship because he didn't know it was a beast.

215
00:21:16,161 --> 00:21:18,961
He thought he was making a mentor himself.

216
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:28,320
Psychologically goes up against the fact that he has over and used it.

217
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:34,641
That's all about sort of his votes, his will, his beliefs, so forth.

218
00:21:34,641 --> 00:21:36,400
But that's not what happens.

219
00:21:36,401 --> 00:21:44,800
So mentally sound up, mentally all things for the best psychology of him.

220
00:21:46,161 --> 00:22:00,880
Telematus gets the idea, or even an idea of the right word, so he changes the world with him and moves over his role of the travel.

221
00:22:01,201 --> 00:22:10,560
He says, or mentors that if I would take steps to make these mentors first, let's say, Paul for a temple and speak your will, and all the dogs to witness.

222
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,681
The tutors must go straight to their home.

223
00:22:14,161 --> 00:22:18,000
And Methodist goes on to the bottom and says, You need not bear this inference of theirs.

224
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,161
You're a silent no longer to prove the line or something.

225
00:22:22,161 --> 00:22:30,961
But God's power is going to be the transform telemetry from a silent to a mental.

226
00:22:30,961 --> 00:22:32,480
It's not about his inner.

227
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,600
He's going to sing the whole world differently.

228
00:22:35,601 --> 00:22:37,760
And that's the job of God.

229
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,880
He's going to sort of do this on the logical thing to him.

230
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,720
This mentor says, you need not bear this influence to theirs.

231
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,240
You are a title no longer.

232
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,641
Have you heard what Gloria John Orestes want?

233
00:22:49,641 --> 00:22:58,681
I think in this part of the oriental young arrest is one of the title and his illustrious father.

234
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,441
He too, and many times have come with people.

235
00:23:06,441 --> 00:23:09,720
What and when Paul tells you what happens?

236
00:23:10,601 --> 00:23:17,480
If he tells you at the top of the leather, this is the telemetry says, you have just your kindness like a father to yourself.

237
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:23,240
Well, what really the people transform from a boy into a man.

238
00:23:29,161 --> 00:23:32,760
But being a left hand is a third of the sentence on and on.

239
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:42,040
And he eats from his father what that phrase says, clearer.

240
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:52,201
So that he morrows to himself, defining that a god is getting his guest, then god-like in his, you know, when he says a godlike man, that he was a boy.

241
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:58,520
Oh, he was a boy, then he clearly, the what world is in, and what's important in that world.

242
00:24:00,121 --> 00:24:03,720
His mother's domains and so forth, or anything like where we are.

243
00:24:10,201 --> 00:24:27,040
What he used to see, but the meaningful distinctions of between, in this case, the honorable and dishonorable charge is attuned to what's going on.

244
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,441
What the Gods actually says is not a private psychological story.

245
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:32,160
It's an angle.

246
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:40,640
That the gods are our world, and people are in there in this world.

247
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:46,880
And the God's job is to atone people to the world that they are in.

248
00:24:47,121 --> 00:24:55,841
It could be an erotic world, it could be an aggressive war world, it could be in this case, the world of us young kids who are taking over the kingdoms.

249
00:24:55,841 --> 00:24:59,280
But he is now attuned to what's going on.

250
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,681
And he announces.

251
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,640
He just tells the Judas.

252
00:25:05,361 --> 00:25:10,720
There was this, but then all of a sudden, he's no longer again.

253
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:22,480
He says, Go elsewhere, consume your own sword, burn, burn about, eat one another's houses, you can eat water, one another, and black dog, and pay nothing, and so forth.

254
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,800
And otherwise, you'll get what you deserve as water here.

255
00:25:26,881 --> 00:25:28,080
Don't try that.

256
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,760
Forbid you to be seen there.

257
00:25:32,161 --> 00:25:36,640
Though you are eligible as your father's son, it was at the end of that long paragraph.

258
00:25:40,161 --> 00:25:47,361
So now these fees gives you all these are data to a god.

259
00:25:47,361 --> 00:25:52,560
There is, oh yeah, the script is the one that says, and soon was dead.

260
00:25:52,560 --> 00:26:00,280
Selemachus, no doubt, the gods themselves, if he forgave you to be sitting in messages, though you're eligible to survive stuff, I think we's struggle.

261
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,480
I think word is a transformed.

262
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,361
Psychology wasn't about being transformed.

263
00:26:05,361 --> 00:26:10,401
This is the key going from being completely out of sync with the world of being.

264
00:26:10,441 --> 00:26:17,880
To be totally interesting on top of his uh fully what I think they say he says seven four.

265
00:26:17,881 --> 00:26:19,961
Why is he saying, Oh, yes.

266
00:26:19,961 --> 00:26:20,840
So who did it?

267
00:26:20,921 --> 00:26:22,040
We have this funny question.

268
00:26:22,441 --> 00:26:31,640
Mentate did menace anything to win by coming in and giving him verifies, or is this really something only a god could do?

269
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:39,400
What some transform a world gets somebody to be go from being a title in the title's world?

270
00:26:39,401 --> 00:26:40,921
Well, do who get it?

271
00:26:40,921 --> 00:26:46,681
Well, I think the important thing to see is that Homer doesn't care who did it.

272
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:51,160
He isn't around and well, was it really the theme that I have to see?

273
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:56,121
They don't care, but mentally whether it was mentates or a theme doesn't matter.

274
00:26:56,201 --> 00:27:02,921
What matters is that some bucket came up, some a godlike thing that transformed his world.

275
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:16,921
And I like it on seven four when uh Telemachus is complaining that Telemachus went to Center says run off with the bucket and go find out how to take back the island.

276
00:27:16,921 --> 00:27:30,120
This is that the death depends what a goddamn who knows or his own heart uh sent him to learn a title if he thought alone.

277
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,720
So it doesn't matter.

278
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:43,080
What matters is that the whole I think part of the flying move the whole move what oh he's called moves nobody gets to be the boy.

279
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:50,921
Mentor tries to be a demon and when Mentor goes run the rest of himself uh world.

280
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:57,441
So Telemachus steps to Mentor's quietly different world.

281
00:27:57,441 --> 00:28:00,081
And he new possibilities for him.

282
00:27:55,881 --> 00:28:03,201
Paul's an assembly of the people.

283
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,201
And he's going to try to get them all together to throw out Cedars.

284
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:08,400
Now something clear.

285
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,120
A clear grasp of a new role.

286
00:28:11,121 --> 00:28:12,160
He's a grown-up.

287
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,720
He's what God's plan to do.

288
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,361
The God function will not get him through.

289
00:28:19,361 --> 00:28:26,240
But let's go figure first and he will completely transform the little tittle of the cottage.

290
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,921
But Paul stands out in the truth quickly to his feet.

291
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:35,040
A figure land is on him sternly grace and tells the telling I was all speed.

292
00:28:35,201 --> 00:28:41,280
Old man made way for him as he took his father's father's place.

293
00:28:41,841 --> 00:28:43,760
He's radiant and fintered and lying.

294
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,880
He's assumed with the situation of feeding.

295
00:28:47,921 --> 00:28:55,121
What happens next with the land basically running off whether it was always full of surprise?

296
00:28:55,921 --> 00:28:58,720
He tries to be wise.

297
00:28:59,201 --> 00:29:05,280
He says, 5721, the whole thing fell out.

298
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,000
He has all the power of all things.

299
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:16,401
They turn face, and then he says, Friends, the lengthy Zeus, if the Holy Darkness, with old men, and so forth, make us into this.

300
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,441
And what happens when he tells it all?

301
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:21,921
He tells you something sort of psychological to him.

302
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,080
He tells you what he desires.

303
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,760
And nothing happens.

304
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,961
He doesn't in a world for him.

305
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,161
Uh they don't he just doesn't, he doesn't work.

306
00:29:34,161 --> 00:29:37,120
He oh, I have to just leaves them old.

307
00:29:37,121 --> 00:29:39,441
And what happens if he reverts to a boy?

308
00:29:39,441 --> 00:29:42,121
He has a temperance into the bottom of that.

309
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:47,881
And I tend to have groups to upright his fears of when the temperature and so forth.

310
00:29:48,201 --> 00:29:50,120
Uh what happened?

311
00:29:50,441 --> 00:29:59,961
Well, interesting I think that a lot of the stories are here, it's a family negatives of Homer Artemis or something.

312
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:05,720
They've done their job, their job, their figure participates, is world principles.

313
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,120
You never have to fall world gods.

314
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:17,240
The first job is to follow his way, the orator, because he said the gods don't perform management.

315
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:28,120
And that Orestes has no skill as speakers to an assembly of older people, booming them, getting them in the right place to do what he wants them to do.

316
00:30:28,121 --> 00:30:29,480
He's done with you.

317
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:39,161
God's substitute for having to have the relevance that is important and what you couldn't do otherwise, multiple of what you aren't normally able to do.

318
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:44,840
No, no, people don't become psychologically as a professor that was a great hitter.

319
00:30:44,841 --> 00:30:49,641
He could see for homelands, then the rest of the hotel has helped him.

320
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:51,400
Well, that happens a lot in the other.

321
00:30:51,401 --> 00:30:57,640
I mean, the gods don't think so to be something that politically strongly couldn't possibly be.

322
00:30:57,641 --> 00:31:02,201
But it's been something that you know how unpsychological but the situation is.

323
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,280
That's not it going on inside when you older woman.

324
00:31:06,601 --> 00:31:07,320
What happened?

325
00:31:07,401 --> 00:31:08,760
And nobody can help it.

326
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,040
They can't do that.

327
00:31:10,361 --> 00:31:14,560
So and these are our code masses of luck and so forth.
