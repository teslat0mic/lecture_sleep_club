1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
If not, one last round into Dante here.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,200
Lots of interesting things are still happening.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:17,999
But first, before I do that, I have to repent and correct the mistakes I made last time, of which there were, I think, several.

4
00:00:17,999 --> 00:00:19,920
I think four, in fact.

5
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:22,079
And I felt bad after last time.

6
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:27,439
I had so many things on my mind and so many different pages that I didn't give a good coherent lecture.

7
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,480
And then I said things that were false besides.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:39,999
So, one, there's the question about universe versus the creation in the very opening lines of the Paradiso.

9
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:45,760
And I said I would look it in Italian with confidence that it would say creation, but it doesn't.

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,600
It says universo.

11
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,160
This is on page 24 of Canto 1 of the Paradiso, which you've got.

12
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,600
Okay, what then?

13
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,960
The funny thing happened, nothing like podcasting.

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:13,519
A student named Joe Temple, Toza Temple, somewhere on the East Coast, began immediately, the next day, researching the universe and trying to figure out why it said universe instead of creation.

15
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:27,759
And I was looking in the Oxford OED, the Oxford English Dictionary, and we were all coming to the same conclusion that the universe has been around way, way back into Roman Latin times.

16
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:39,400
It doesn't really mean any particular view like the cosmos, which we know it's going to turn it's eternal, and you know, lots of things about the Greek view of the cosmos.

17
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,799
And we know a lot about the creation, that's what we've been, maybe more than we'd like to know.

18
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:58,679
But Dante, and we know that we talk about the universe, and when we do, we mean a unified physical something or other that has no human meaning whatsoever.

19
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:04,999
And we don't even know whether it has a beginning and a big bang or whether it goes on eternally like the cosmos.

20
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:09,720
But whenever Dante says universe, he means the whole thing.

21
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,399
It isn't a stand on which kind of whole thing.

22
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:18,199
The word universe means the unified whole.

23
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:26,600
So, in a way, it would have been okay to translate it the creation, though it isn't the word Dante uses.

24
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:32,999
But when he thinks of the unified whole, he thinks of the creation.

25
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:37,080
And it's a universe because it's unified.

26
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:48,119
And he certainly thinks it's very unified on page 363, very near the end of the whole thing, which you have.

27
00:02:49,400 --> 00:03:00,999
We hear when Dante, now we're in Canto 33 and looking at line 84 in the Paradiso.

28
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:11,799
I saw within its depths how it, that is, God, conceives all things in a single volume bound by love, of which the universe is the scattered leaves.

29
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:13,640
It's all this single volume.

30
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:20,600
Naturally, it's all one thing, unified thing, because it's been created by one unified God.

31
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,760
I mean, if the Greek gods were creating things, the pantheon wouldn't create a unified thing at all.

32
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,199
They'd create a whole bunch of different worlds, each God creating their own.

33
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:33,519
Since there's one God creating all this, it's got to be unified.

34
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,280
And on 364, there's more about that.

35
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,480
I don't think I'll talk about that yet, 364.

36
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,319
That is more relevant in a minute.

37
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,879
So, okay, so much for the universe.

38
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:56,079
It turns out that it's okay to say universe and it's okay to say creation, and Dante says both, and they both mean the same thing when whichever one Dante says, it doesn't, nothing is at stake in distinguishing them.

39
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:11,840
So, the next thing I said was: I didn't know whether Dante has a body when he's in paradise floating up or speeding up toward the Emchorean, toward God, like as I say, like a rocket off the top of purgatory.

40
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,840
But I'm convinced he does have a body.

41
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,760
There is no way that Dante could exist.

42
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,840
He'd be dead if he didn't have a body.

43
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,920
And now I ask you to help me find something.

44
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,120
Keep your eyes open.

45
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:24,960
Somewhere, I spent about 45 minutes and I couldn't find it.

46
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:36,960
Somewhere in the Paradiso, the souls that come to visit him on one of the spheres are surprised that he has his body because of their, of course, they're all dead and they don't.

47
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:51,040
And I would just like to have that, but I know he keeps his body, and I know that the people in these various spheres never saw any embodied person going up through these spheres before.

48
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,560
You look worried, is that?

49
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:55,520
Okay, so if and I, but I couldn't find it.

50
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,720
Now comes a big deal issue, a really interesting big deal issue.

51
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,080
So it's Beatrice on free Will.

52
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,719
After I said that Beatrice never talks, well, let's go the other way.

53
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:14,280
Marco Lombardo in the purgatory.

54
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,440
Now, it's so hard to keep all these things in your hands.

55
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:33,400
Okay, when Dante talks to Marco Lombardo, it doesn't matter who he is, on 173, in the purgatory, Panto 16, there is this interesting story going on.

56
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:50,200
First, it's important to know, and I've read it once before, but I think it's so important, that every creature is created by God, ready to return to God because that creature needs the kind of fulfillment that that kind of creature can get only finally from God.

57
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:55,400
I've said that a million times, but that's what happens when you get a created universe.

58
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:59,480
But I want to read for reasons that we'll get to in a minute, starting on 85.

59
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:15,799
From the hand of God, whose love shines like a ray upon it, even before birth, comes forth a simple soul, which, like a child at play, cries, laughs, in ignorance of every measure, but the glad impulse of its joyous maker turns eagerly to all that gives it pleasure.

60
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:19,799
So there's this happy baby that is sort of getting a kick out of everything.

61
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:29,320
It tastes small pleasures first, and it clings, deceived, and seeks no others unless someone curb it, guide its love to higher things.

62
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:36,040
So its parents and the church and the state, particularly the church, guides it to higher things.

63
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,960
Now that's all fine.

64
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:47,960
And on the next page, we're told how Rome, the church, the sword, and the crook, worked together to do this.

65
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:51,880
But that's not what I want to talk about now.

66
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,080
What he says on 190.

67
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:57,920
So much for that.

68
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,400
Why do I even quote that?

69
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:12,080
Well, because free will, I want to point out, is this capacity we've got to turn aside from just going after what everything is.

70
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:14,720
So back on 173.

71
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:25,040
So free will, in capital F and W, the third canto, though it be strange in battles with the heavens, can conquer all if it is well sustained.

72
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,640
So we've got free will, and we're not determined.

73
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:34,480
The heavens are the astrology idea that somehow what star you're born under determines you.

74
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,799
And Dante thinks, no, you've got free will.

75
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:37,920
You're not determined.

76
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:45,040
It would be by the DNA now or whatever the natural order now is, that you're free.

77
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,999
He's clear about that.

78
00:07:46,000 --> 00:08:00,080
You're free subjects of a more immense nature and power, which grants your intellect, and therefore men today turn, if therefore, men today turn from God's laws, the fault is in yourselves to seek and so forth, and the cause.

79
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:09,520
You can't blame it on astrology or bad luck in your family or your environment or your DNA.

80
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,760
Now, but then what is free will?

81
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,199
Now comes the interesting question.

82
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,559
That hasn't really told you.

83
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:16,880
It just says you've got free will.

84
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,239
What does it do?

85
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,200
And now comes the weird part.

86
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,200
This is where I said something wrong, but we have to follow it.

87
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,280
So it looks like we're going to find out about free will later.

88
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,400
And it's going to be Beatrice that's going to tell us.

89
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,520
And we start on 189 now.

90
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:48,760
And that's where we're told in the 63 that one of the jobs of free will is to guard the threshold of consent.

91
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,400
That is, don't just run after everything.

92
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:58,520
Learn to get your desires in correspondence with how much satisfaction you can get.

93
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,520
And now comes the puzzling thing.

94
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,000
On the top of 190.

95
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,199
Or to put it this way, all love, let us say, that burns in you springs from necessity, but you still have the power to check its sway.

96
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:30,200
That could be, and it seems to be, the Virgil-like comment that you have the power to rein in your love, to curb your love, to get it dimmed down so that you don't expect more from things and other people than they can give you.

97
00:09:30,199 --> 00:09:33,319
And that seems to be the wrong view.

98
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:38,600
I'm not going to read again how the moon comes out, the stars come out, Dante goes to sleep.

99
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:47,959
I found a place, by the way, I won't bother to read it to you, where Beatrice explains something clearly to Dante, and instead of falling asleep, he gets wide awake and all excited.

100
00:09:47,959 --> 00:10:02,520
It confirms my impression that if Virgil were telling him the true story here, that free will is there to check how much, to hold in your love, and not, or your desire, Virgil would say, then Virgil's getting it all wrong.

101
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,239
But that's not what I'm going to talk about now, because I've talked about that.

102
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:06,840
It's the next paragraph.

103
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,360
Well, 73.

104
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:17,000
These noble powers, the powers to check your love, to hold it in, to curb it, will comprehend.

105
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,080
These noble powers, Beatrice will comprehend as free will.

106
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:25,200
Keep that term in mind if she should speak of it as you ascend.

107
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,839
Well, that's a weird, weird thing.

108
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:38,400
I can't tell whether Dante's being very shrewd or very stupid or just absent-minded, but I said, and this is another one of my mistakes, you learn, it's wonderful to make mistakes.

109
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:45,840
I've learned something about will, I mean, it's a world, and I've learned something about bodies in paradise, but I don't know where to find it.

110
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,760
And now I learned something about what happens with Beatrice.

111
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,880
I said that Beatrice never talks about free will in the Paradiso.

112
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:08,799
And that's okay, because Virgil is getting it all wrong at this point, and it's not going to be something that Beatrice is going to want to explain further Virgil's understanding of free will.

113
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,320
But maybe Beatrice has her own understanding of free will.

114
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:14,799
Well, I said no.

115
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,440
And then, isn't here is he?

116
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:19,199
I wanted to, this was mainly for Ben.

117
00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:38,480
Ben came up and said, Ben is one of the TAs, but if I'd only looked at the footnote to this, to line 75, I would find out that Beatrice discusses free will in the sphere of the moon, Paradise 5, 19, following.

118
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:41,360
And therefore, I was wrong.

119
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:44,079
Well, in a funny way, I wasn't wrong.

120
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,920
And you learn something interesting.

121
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,879
I don't even know quite what to make of it.

122
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,920
But you go there where Beatrice is going to discuss free will.

123
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,880
Let's go there.

124
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,839
So we go to Canto, we go to Paradiso, Canto 5.

125
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,959
Oh, you don't have it, I think.

126
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,000
No, you don't have it, because it turns out not to be important.

127
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,959
Because Beatrice doesn't explain free will.

128
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,719
She already gets it wrong again.

129
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:10,439
She already is, you know, a sort of guaranteed loser.

130
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,920
I hope he isn't listening to the podcast.

131
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:22,680
But in any case, this time you look to see Beatrice discussing free will, which is what he said in his footnote, she's going to do.

132
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:24,600
Well, she mentions free will.

133
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:29,880
I mean, it's not a mistake exactly, but she doesn't explain it or discuss it at all.

134
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,320
I will read what happens.

135
00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:41,560
She says they're discussing how you, to what extent somebody who's made a vow can give up the vow.

136
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,160
And it's complicated.

137
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,799
After all, you make a vow to God and so forth.

138
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:48,600
You can't just drop it.

139
00:12:48,599 --> 00:12:58,920
And what she says is, you're free to make the vow and under certain circumstances to give it up.

140
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,480
The only important line is 22.

141
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:07,000
The gift by him most prized is the freedom he bestowed upon the will.

142
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:08,200
Sorry, that's God.

143
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:09,319
Let's start a little earlier.

144
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:14,839
Of all creation, bounty realized, of all, well, start again.

145
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:30,679
Of all creations, bounty realized, that is of all the great things in creation, God's gift, the gift in which mankind is most like him, the gift by him most prized, what would you expect?

146
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,519
Would you expect love?

147
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,839
But what he is the freedom he bestows upon the will.

148
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,079
Now that's amazing and confusing, and I don't know what to make of it.

149
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,520
I'll tell you what I think.

150
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:45,400
I don't think it matters.

151
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:53,759
But nobody, and not Beatrice of all people, should be saying that the most important thing that God gave people was free will.

152
00:13:53,759 --> 00:14:11,519
The most important thing God gave people was the ability to love and to, and I'll jump ahead of the story, to lose their will, for their will to become one with the sun and the other stars, the last line of the poem, which I read to you last time, and I'll come back to it.

153
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:17,199
If free will was so important, why didn't God, in the end, sort of take it away?

154
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:29,279
So free will can at best be your ability to swerve toward things that are good, but also swerve away from things that are bad.

155
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,559
And free will can be your ability to make vows and under certain conditions break them.

156
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:42,560
But Beatrice isn't explaining here, as she already says she does, or even discussing here free will.

157
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,959
She's just announcing that free will is the best thing that God ever gave us.

158
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:56,239
And that, period, and that therefore you can make and break bows, which is what she is discussing.

159
00:14:56,239 --> 00:14:58,239
Now, I don't know what to make of all that.

160
00:14:58,239 --> 00:15:08,320
I mean, I think I just can't understand why God would say, if you read Descartes, you'd be even more amazed.

161
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:17,760
Descartes says, and he's got, he should say, because he's an autonomy guy, the first autonomy guy, that the most important thing we've got is free will.

162
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,799
Our free will is infinite like God's.

163
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,479
Okay, from Descartes, but it's not a Dante idea.

164
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:25,839
It doesn't belong in here.

165
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,120
It's as if it's floated in from the Enlightenment.

166
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,400
Yeah, Dave.

167
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,759
Does he say that free will is the most important?

168
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,559
And how does he, does he say you justify it in any way?

169
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,959
Isn't that amazing?

170
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,000
Where did they get it?

171
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,279
I can't imagine.

172
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:42,119
You don't, I suppose, maybe Aristotle.

173
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,079
I mean, I can't picture Aristotle making a big deal.

174
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,599
You think Aristotle?

175
00:15:47,479 --> 00:16:02,199
Anyway, it's true that Beatrice mentions free will in the Paradiso, just like Marco Lombardo said, or whoever it is, said she would.

176
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:06,999
But it's not true that she says anything interesting about it, except that it's important.

177
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:17,959
And then she says nothing more about it in the whole of the Paradiso, although we're told it's the most important thing that God gave people and that He prizes it more than anything else.

178
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:23,799
You think we hear a little about what it is and how it functions and why it's so important and blah, blah, blah.

179
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,240
Well, I don't know.

180
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:29,959
I learned something, but I must say what I learned is not very coherent.

181
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,120
So there it is.

182
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,040
That's all I have to say about that.

183
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,920
I'll put it this way.

184
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:42,120
In God's creation, instinct is automatically drawn toward God.

185
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,519
We hear that way back on 28.

186
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:45,799
I don't know if I should read it.

187
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,479
I'll go back and see.

188
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:49,559
Well, that's right.

189
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,799
That's when they start going toward God.

190
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:58,599
And now it's to a place foretold: we are soaring, driven by that bow whose every arrow finds a mark of gold.

191
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:06,679
That's this instinct in which the creature moves toward God, and it retains the power to turn aside.

192
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:08,439
That's free will.

193
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:14,439
Free will gets in the way of just going directly to God.

194
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:21,160
So, and so I don't understand why free will is so important.

195
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,439
Let me see if I have anything more to say.

196
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,160
I'll just worrying on.

197
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:47,999
Well I'd I want to stress that what Dante should be saying in Beatrice is that we should let ourselves be open to the attractiveness of God and we should love God through everything and we should finally get to the supreme being, God Himself, who is the ultimately totally fulfilling object.

198
00:17:47,999 --> 00:17:51,120
There's nothing important about free will in all that.

199
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:59,039
The only people who take free will seriously, I think, in Dante, in spite of this remark of Beatrice's, are the people who.

200
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,959
Who are the people who are autonomous and exert their free will?

201
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:04,640
Big puzzle.

202
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,400
Somebody must know.

203
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:06,800
What?

204
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,959
Yeah, the people inside the wall of this.

205
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:09,920
Is that what you said?

206
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,479
Good.

207
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:21,840
Yes, the people who have built a wall to keep God out and who have freely substituted other unnatural goods for the good that God has around.

208
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,119
It's a hopeless task.

209
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,719
It's a hopeless job because the more they do it, the less movement they've got until they get frozen into ice.

210
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:30,400
You can't get away with that.

211
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,239
Free will is a bad thing.

212
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:37,359
It gets in the way of opening yourself to God's love.

213
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,039
And in the end, you've just got to give your will over to God.

214
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:47,519
The important thing is autonomy is not a positive value for Dante.

215
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,039
And how a bit of Descartes and Kant crept into Aristotle and St.

216
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,880
Thomas and Dante is beyond me.

217
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,359
Yeah.

218
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,439
But I don't think it would have to be Descartes.

219
00:18:57,439 --> 00:19:01,439
I think it's it's really the tuning your thoughts in proper end.

220
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:10,439
If that you didn't have that kind of freedom inferno and all that would make no badness, that doesn't have to be found based for merit or where you involved.

221
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:11,320
Yeah.

222
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,120
Well, sort of.

223
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:22,519
I mean, so there's I mean, we have to make up a story about free will, really, because Dante just fluffs it.

224
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:28,439
But I mean, there seems to be the two three functions for for free will.

225
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:29,880
One is bad.

226
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:37,239
You you become autonomous, you reject God, you set yourself up as independent and you live in the in sin city.

227
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:50,759
Then there is the fact that you could use your free will to deviate from the attractiveness of things and love things more than you should or less than you should.

228
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:55,079
And then there's the possibility that you can use your free will to fix that.

229
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,360
And when you do, you get back to where you started, so to speak.

230
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:04,600
If you were so totally innocent and pure, you would just go after everything in the appropriate way and you wouldn't need your will.

231
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,439
And that's finally where you end up.

232
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:14,039
So but free will sort of is a bad thing which is it is also able to correct, something like that.

233
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:18,199
But as the great and why, you know, that's nice.

234
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:28,199
Then why that should be the main thing in a philosophy that has made love and agape and so forth its main virtue is bizarre.

235
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:30,679
But I think Davis casts some light on it.

236
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:42,359
For Aristotle, whom you haven't read, who is as secular as you can get, who doesn't have any sense of divine love and sacred well, not well, not a tiny bit, maybe, but not very much.

237
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:49,640
For Aristotle, you you could imagine that perhaps free will is the highest thing he can he can think we've got.

238
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,599
I don't even believe it.

239
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,359
I think Aristotle thought intellect was the highest thing.

240
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:54,640
It's beyond me.

241
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,160
I give up on free will.

242
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:57,439
So I'm going on.

243
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:07,199
So, and I know, so the last thing is: people have been telling me, well, I've been saying, this is all my mistakes, which don't turn out to be mistakes.

244
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,160
Yeah, yeah.

245
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,959
Yeah, I think he has his body.

246
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:15,039
Was that the place where it happened?

247
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,279
That he's got his body?

248
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:17,760
Where?

249
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:18,479
Where?

250
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:20,479
Well, let's go look at it.

251
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,480
I guess I missed it because I thought it was later, and I started looking later.

252
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:27,519
In the first tanto, tell me more.

253
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,279
99.

254
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,400
First tanto, am I in the pair in the paradiso?

255
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,160
I don't see it yet.

256
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,600
Siniba, line 100.

257
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,519
Aha, how can I rise?

258
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:44,400
Okay, now, in my gross body, through such airy substance.

259
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:47,520
And then she explains it to him.

260
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:49,679
Yeah, that's the line I was looking for.

261
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:56,319
Although there is another place still that goes with this, which is not this one, but also the souls are surprised.

262
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,840
You haven't read that in your reading.

263
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:06,319
When they come down and find him, the embodied person sitting there on the sphere of the sun, for instance, it has never happened before or since.

264
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,640
Okay, now, finally, I went around saying, and this is now more interesting.

265
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,959
I just wanted to clear these other things up.

266
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:22,239
Here, that Jesus is never talked about in the Paradiso, where you'd expect to find him.

267
00:22:22,239 --> 00:22:28,319
And so, as I was looking through it, I was looking and looking for mention of Jesus.

268
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:42,439
Well, to begin with, oddly enough, and for reasons I don't know, Jesus is never mentioned, the word Jesus, that there is the Son, that is S-O-N, mentioned, and that is, and several times.

269
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:45,160
And now comes the interesting thing.

270
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:49,880
What is Jesus' big achievement that he should be mentioned for?

271
00:22:50,199 --> 00:23:05,400
Well, you might think, you know, if Beatrice is like Jesus, and if we were Protestants, we should think Jesus is immensely lovable, adorable, and Jesus loves us, and that that's very, very important.

272
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:14,199
But the only thing about Jesus that Dante pays attention to, this is all news to me, and I'm surprised and puzzled.

273
00:23:14,199 --> 00:23:24,039
It's sort of loose end in Dante, is there is another function of Jesus we haven't talked about at all because it doesn't have anything to do with Beatrice.

274
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:33,160
And that is that in the crucifixion, Jesus suffered for all man's sins.

275
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,479
The vicarious suffering.

276
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:52,280
So there's a whole story which I don't need to go into where Jesus is, where Adam sinned, everybody's guilty, somebody has to suffer, all mankind has been suffering, but God sends Jesus, his Son, and He does the suffering for everybody.

277
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:58,920
I think it is the most incomprehensible and uninteresting part of Christianity, but that's neither here.

278
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,600
So does Dostoevsky, I think, but that's neither here nor there.

279
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,319
He works hard to make sense of it.

280
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:11,160
Anyway, but this is what's happening on page 87 of the parody.

281
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,479
So Jesus gets mentioned, but not as Jesus.

282
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:22,920
Thus it was up to God in his own way to give man back his whole life and perfection.

283
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:35,600
And then skipping down to line 115, for God in giving himself that man might be able to raise himself gave even more than if he had forgiven him in mercy.

284
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,959
See, we're talking about forgiving all of our sins because Adam sinned, we're all sinful.

285
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:44,800
These are weird things that I don't think Dante cares about.

286
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,160
They get tossed off.

287
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,279
But anyway, God could have just said, okay, I'm merciful.

288
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,560
I'm going to forgive everybody.

289
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,679
Never mind that Adam did this thing and we're all sinful.

290
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:12,160
But even better than that, Dante says, all other means would have been short of the perfect justice, but that God's own Son, capital S, Jesus, but not called Jesus, humbled himself to take on mortal clay.

291
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:16,880
So Jesus takes on a body that's already interesting.

292
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:24,319
A body which, because Dante is getting so platonic here, doesn't seem to be a good thing to have.

293
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:30,239
Although, remember, Dante says in another place, you'll be better when you get your body back than you are now.

294
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:34,880
Well, you think if that's the trait, then why shouldn't Jesus take on this body?

295
00:25:35,439 --> 00:25:38,719
Why is it so bad to take on mortal clay?

296
00:25:38,719 --> 00:25:50,479
But that's, and the answers, I mean, there's no answer to that, but why he does it, why he takes it on, I just want to tell you, is because he makes up for our sinfulness.

297
00:25:50,479 --> 00:25:52,960
This is way off on 165.

298
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:58,239
Again, you don't need to know this, but I have to talk about where Jesus is in here.

299
00:25:58,239 --> 00:26:01,040
He talks about he has a vision of Christ.

300
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,999
Now he's calling Jesus Christ.

301
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:14,359
And that whoever takes his cross and follows Christ will pardon me that I leave here unsaid what he sees at the great dawn from Christ.

302
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,319
Period.

303
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,199
That's it.

304
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:21,080
That's Jesus in all of the Paradiso story, except for one other place.

305
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,519
Maybe you got it or something.

306
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:23,640
Oh, maybe that's what I mean.

307
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:24,920
Oh, no, I don't know that one.

308
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,640
We have to find it.

309
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,360
31.

310
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,920
Let me just wait to make sure that I've got my references here.

311
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:33,560
Well, okay, I just want to say, finish.

312
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,239
Oh, maybe you've got the same one I have.

313
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:37,319
I have page 354.

314
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,599
Is that right?

315
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,960
Oh, you've got another one.

316
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:41,239
346.

317
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,079
346?

318
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:45,239
342.

319
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,199
Okay.

320
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:48,120
What lines?

321
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,360
107.

322
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,320
Aha, yeah.

323
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,600
Oh, Jesus even.

324
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,480
Look at that.

325
00:26:53,640 --> 00:27:04,040
Says to himself, as long as it is, my Lord Jesus Christ, true God, and is this then the likeness of thy living flesh portrayed?

326
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,239
What is going on?

327
00:27:05,239 --> 00:27:10,359
So did I gaze in the living love of him who in this world?

328
00:27:11,239 --> 00:27:12,439
Well, I don't know what's happening.

329
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:14,039
We have to look and see.

330
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,719
Do you know what's happening?

331
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,679
Okay, then we have to all look and see.

332
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,679
Well, that's a new problem for me to learn.

333
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:21,479
I don't know.

334
00:27:21,479 --> 00:27:23,640
I don't understand what's going on.

335
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:32,759
See, the reason I'm so puzzled, I mean, he could just be seeing Jesus throned and crowned, as he's talking about.

336
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:34,920
The queen is resonant.

337
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,759
No, the queen is.

338
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:39,079
Well, no, no, the queen is thrown and crowned.

339
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,559
He's just making an analogy.

340
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:45,639
Any help from Chiardi?

341
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,959
That is asking a lot, but we better look.

342
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:48,999
108.

343
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,920
I wonder if this is the vision that..

344
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,640
Bernard had.

345
00:27:54,959 --> 00:28:01,039
He was rewarded for his holiness being permitted a vision of heaven's blessedness while he was yet on earth.

346
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,400
Is that what it's about?

347
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,679
No, that's later.

348
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,479
No, Chardi doesn't have a thing to say about it.

349
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:08,880
Well, all I can say is a new puzzle.

350
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,160
We'll learn some.

351
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,199
But it doesn't change.

352
00:28:11,199 --> 00:28:21,120
It won't change anything important because it turns out that Jesus doesn't play any special role.

353
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:28,239
Not God being made flesh, not loving us, not us loving Jesus.

354
00:28:28,719 --> 00:28:33,359
And Jesus is finally really completely disembodied.

355
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:40,719
The last mention of Jesus is sort of trivial and pathetic, it seems to me, on 365.

356
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:52,640
Given that that's very under the poem now, given you got a kind of abstract God that doesn't have any body, but is this pure radiance in three circles?

357
00:28:52,640 --> 00:29:00,559
If you look into that pure radiance, Dante says, you can see a man's image.

358
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,239
This is the very top of 365.

359
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:10,640
And he says, seemed in itself of its own coloration to be painted with a man's image.

360
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,519
I fixed my eyes on that alone in rapturous contemplation.

361
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:26,319
So Jesus turns out finally to be in the Paradiso story without a body and pretty much without a job, it seems to me.

362
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,120
And that's inevitable, I want to say.

363
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:44,920
If you start trying to think about Christianity in Greek categories, you're going to end up with an Aristotelian God that has no place for becoming a body and no personality and not the sort of being you could really pray to.

364
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:52,920
Dante does pray, but he prays to Beatrice, which is because Beatrice takes on all the interesting functions of Jesus.

365
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,079
Beatrice has a body.

366
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,079
Beatrice loves Dante.

367
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,679
Dante loves Beatrice.

368
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:01,400
Dante can pray to Beatrice and so forth.

369
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:06,920
She's doing all the jobs of Jesus.

370
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,559
And Jesus is left with sort of no jobs.

371
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,599
And that's it for that.

372
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:15,800
So, okay.

373
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:25,719
Now comes the general ending of the poem, where you see, I think, the total breakdown of the whole attempt.

374
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,640
I mean, this is really fascinating.

375
00:30:27,639 --> 00:30:33,880
I mean, there is this huge medieval synthesis, this amazing achievement of finding Aristotle and St.

376
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:39,800
Thomas trans and putting Aristotle together with Christianity, and that's called the medieval synthesis.

377
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:46,280
And the question is: what sort of view does it give us of God and of us and their relation?

378
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,959
Does it make any sense?

379
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:52,439
And it seems to me it just breaks down completely.

380
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,679
And so I don't really understand.

381
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:01,160
And maybe people will send me iPod messages.

382
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:12,679
I mean, how do people still believe this medieval synthesis, this mapping of Christianity on Aristotle that St.

383
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,879
Thomas brought about?

384
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:22,559
Because Dante, it seems to me, sort of thinking it through and feeling it through, ends up with the breakdown of everything.

385
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,959
But now let me see if I can show you this.

386
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,400
I don't have to convince you of that.

387
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,559
I'm not saying that Christianity breaks down.

388
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:35,120
I'm saying the attempt to put Christianity in Greek terms breaks down.

389
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:39,120
So much the better for Christianity once you stop trying to do that.

390
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:43,600
Okay, so here we go at the end of the poem.

391
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:53,360
So God has created this best of all possible worlds in which everything is harmonized and everybody is going to be happy.

392
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,519
This is in Canto 8, line 100.

393
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:03,999
Not only does that perfect mind provide for the diversities of every nature, but for their good and harmony besides.

394
00:32:03,999 --> 00:32:05,519
I mean, that's all over the place.

395
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,359
I mean, that's what you get from a good, perfect creator God.

396
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:15,679
You get a world in which everything is harmonized and all and taken care of.

397
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:23,519
And therefore, all you have to do is get in the right relation to God, and you'll be taken care of.

398
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:29,600
And now it's in your own reading, in Canto 30, line 39.

399
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:41,439
She says, or Dante says, light of the intellect, which is love unending, love of the true good, which is holy bliss, bliss beyond bliss, all joys transcending.

400
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:47,040
I mean, that's what it is to contemplate God, according to Dante.

401
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:52,719
And I'm already sort of worried about that, that you don't hear anything about love in there.

402
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,640
It seems too intellectual.

403
00:32:54,639 --> 00:33:00,559
But again, that's already what happens when you put philosophy into it.

404
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,640
It turns in, that's the Aristotle problem.

405
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:06,239
But that's not the real problem.

406
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,760
There's a big, much, much bigger problem.

407
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:14,760
And that starts to become clear on 364.

408
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,560
That's Canto 33, line 100.

409
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:23,880
So experiencing that radiance, he's now looking straight into God.

410
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:29,160
The spirit is so indrawn, it is impossible even to think of ever turning from it.

411
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:41,720
For the good, which is the will's ultimate object, that's God's, they set us up that way, is all subsumed in it, being removed, all is defective, which in it is perfect.

412
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:46,199
Well, in other words, looking into God, all your desires are fulfilled.

413
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,000
You wouldn't want to look anyplace else.

414
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,280
Now, that's when things begin to break down.

415
00:33:52,280 --> 00:34:00,520
Remember that Dante was, at the beginning of the divine comedy, a very committed person.

416
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:04,200
He had at least two total commitments.

417
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:14,439
One of them was to Beatrice, that he's writing this whole poem for, who's his lady, gives his whole life meaning, for whom he would die, the whole chivalric story.

418
00:34:14,439 --> 00:34:18,840
And the other, which you see a lot less of, is his political commitments.

419
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:33,320
That we did see this, that Dante created this place outside of the limbo that isn't even in the tradition to put the uncommitted people, the people that Giardi calls opportunists, but who aren't opportunists.

420
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,520
They're uncommitted.

421
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:44,599
And we see him again getting very upset about the slothful in purgatory and uh in in in uh inferno.

422
00:34:44,599 --> 00:35:15,520
Dante is a totally activist, political, committed, to the point of being exiled person now so it's incredible but but inevitable that if god is so totally satisfied ask yourself how is politics going to look and how is Beatrice going to look from the point of view of Dante who's now seeing it all from Paradise's perspective.

423
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:23,840
Well first I gave out to you the handout that has on it page 250 and 251 of the parody.

424
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,119
So I gave it out last time because I thought I was going to get there last time.

425
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:41,680
That it's just a few cantos, but it's so touching and it's so important that all of his political commitments vanish from where he, from looking down from paradise.

426
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:57,280
So on page 250, line 132, my eyes went back through the seven spheres below and I saw this globe, that's us, the earth, so small, so lost in space, I had to smile with such a starry show.

427
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,040
Who thinks it is the least pebble in the skies?

428
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:09,840
I must one who, certain who thinks, as someone who thinks it is the least pebble in the skies, I must approve anybody who thinks that.

429
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,920
Only the mind that turns to other things may truly be called wise.

430
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,479
Anybody who cares about anything earthly isn't wise.

431
00:36:18,479 --> 00:36:37,359
And then again at the very end, line 150, and turning there with the eternal twins, that forget those are two stark constellations, I saw, and here's the crucial line, the dusty little threshing floor that makes us ravenous for our mad sins and so forth.

432
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:46,600
That is, that he sees the earth as a dusty little threshing floor where people get committed to things.

433
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,880
And that now turns out to be not wise.

434
00:36:51,880 --> 00:37:08,360
And he sees what a terrible mistake it is to care about anything earthly when you've got, remember, you've got to keep in mind an experience coming up in the order of the book of a God that is so radiant, so fulfilling that you couldn't turn away from him.

435
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,319
So how in the world could you care about politics?

436
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:19,319
Or, and now it gets even more interesting, yeah, now it gets even more interesting, of course, because this is something you know about.

437
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,000
You don't know about politics.

438
00:37:20,999 --> 00:37:24,840
We didn't have time for that, and it isn't really interesting anyway.

439
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:30,840
But what you, but the other thing, what else does he have to give up by this story?

440
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,760
You ought to be able to figure that out.

441
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,999
He's committed to politics.

442
00:37:34,999 --> 00:37:36,840
What else is he committed to?

443
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,040
Beatrice.

444
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:39,639
He has to give up Beatrice.

445
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:42,760
That's where the thing begins to break down completely.

446
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:50,920
This greatest poem that he's writing to this greatest person who is the Jesus figure for him now leaves him.

447
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,959
And he's happy.

448
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:53,320
He doesn't mind at all.

449
00:37:53,320 --> 00:38:10,200
So there was once upon a time he embodied Beatrice whose legs, whose mouth, whose eyes, and then anyway, after she dies, whose soul was supposed to be totally ravishing, sensually and intellectually and spiritually and everything.

450
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:15,560
And what, of course, once he sees God, he doesn't need her anymore.

451
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:26,800
On page 340, when he's after looking into the divine radiance, he turns, or where's he looking at?

452
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:38,799
So, well, he's looking, I don't know, not at the absolutely looking at God, because he wouldn't be able to turn away, but he turns, having looked at some aspect of God, and what does he see?

453
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,800
Beatrice is gone.

454
00:38:41,439 --> 00:38:45,679
And he sees instead Saint Bernard.

455
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,400
But at the bottom of 340, which you have 31, she, where is she?

456
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,560
I cried in sudden dread.

457
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:59,920
And he says, Saint, to lead you to the goal of all your wish, Beatrice called me from my place, and so forth.

458
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,039
So what do you get there?

459
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:03,840
Beatrice is the way and not the truth.

460
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:15,360
Beatrice's job was to lead Dante to the point where he could have a vision of God so overwhelming that he wouldn't even care about Beatrice.

461
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:24,240
That's what she was supposed to do, and that's what she did, and he thanks her for it on page 341.

462
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,920
And it's like what one would normally thank Jesus for.

463
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:38,319
Middle of it, line 79: O lady in whom my hope shall ever soar, and who for my salvation suffered even to set your feet upon hell's broken floor, and so forth and so on.

464
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,360
You have led me, and now line 85, that's the path, that's the way.

465
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:52,880
You have led me from my bondage and set me free by all those roads, all those loving means that lay within your power and charity.

466
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,080
And that's it.

467
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,080
She's set him up to look at God.

468
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,600
And now what happens when they look at her and when he looks at her?

469
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:06,719
Well, first, she gives him one last look on 341, the bottom of the page.

470
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,920
Such was my prayer.

471
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:13,160
And she, far up a mountain, as it appeared to me, looked down and smiled.

472
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:16,120
Then she turned back to the eternal fountain.

473
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:21,239
And if you're reading carefully, you understand that she's never going to turn away from it again.

474
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,239
She only had to turn away from it to help.

475
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,280
Dante, where's that quote I read you already?

476
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:31,800
Once you've seen God, it is so fulfilling, you can never turn away from it again.

477
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:35,560
I don't know where it is.

478
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:37,080
Here it is.

479
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,959
The top of 364.

480
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:45,959
Experiencing that radiance, the spirit is so indrawn it is impossible even to think of ever turning from it.

481
00:40:45,959 --> 00:40:48,120
So he's going to look at the radiance.

482
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:53,640
Now, Beatrice gives him one look, and that's it.

483
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:55,959
Then she goes back to her place in the rose.

484
00:40:55,959 --> 00:40:57,640
Now you look at this.

485
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:08,359
So just, I had to get this and hand it out to you so you could see that Dante sees, where do you see Beatrice?

486
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,800
You see her there?

487
00:41:10,439 --> 00:41:14,520
Up on the left, three notches down.

488
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:20,680
I drew a little circle around it, but not in this copy, so because you have to find her yourself.

489
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:26,040
So I don't know quite where Dante is standing outside of this whole thing, I guess.

490
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:36,280
And he is seeing Beatrice way off in the distance, giving him one last look and then turning toward God, the center of this.

491
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,559
And that's the end.

492
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:40,520
She doesn't see Dante anymore.

493
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:49,000
And presumably, when Dante gets pulled into it, he doesn't see Beatrice anymore either.

494
00:41:49,959 --> 00:41:51,880
I don't know if I have evidence for that.

495
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,800
Let's see.

496
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,319
It follows, I permanent things, but I would like to see it.

497
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:58,959
Oh, of course I, of course, it follows, and I'll see it in a minute.

498
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:11,120
So there's no place in God's creation anymore once you've seen God for anything else being significant or important to you.

499
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:19,360
Because God is so significant and so important and so satisfies every desire that you wouldn't ever turn away.

500
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:23,600
And finally, that's what happens to Dante.

501
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:31,360
He gets zapped up into this eternal contemplation of God.

502
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:45,119
And so he never's going to see Beatrice again on 365 at the very bottom, the last lines of the poem, which is supposed to be a comedy that seems to me very sad.

503
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:59,840
142, here my powers rest from their high fantasy, but already I could feel my being turned, instinct and intellect balanced equally, as in a wheel whose motion nothing jars by the love that moves the sun and the other stars.

504
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,320
That is, what's happened to Dante?

505
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:27,439
Well, he's finally been led by Beatrice, who was disembodied, to a God who also has no body, and they all have nothing to do with the world, which is that mortal play, and no place for love and devotion to any particular person or particular thing.

506
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:35,920
All there is is a total radiance with the faint glimmer of a human face.

507
00:43:36,479 --> 00:43:38,520
And that's what he's going to see now.

508
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:41,319
If he were dead, that's what he was going to see for eternity.

509
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:44,520
But he's got his special case where he's going to have to go back to the world.

510
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:52,200
It's very interesting to ask yourself: what is his view going to be of politics and what is his memory of Beatrice going to be once he's seen that?

511
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,760
I think he has to think that they're all trivial.

512
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:57,319
How could they not be trivial?

513
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,400
And once you've seen what it's like to merge with God.

514
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:06,999
And that's the happy ending of the comedy, of what they later called the divine comedy.

515
00:44:06,999 --> 00:44:09,400
Dante is wiped out.

516
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:14,439
He doesn't have a will anymore, a personality anymore, an identity anymore.

517
00:44:14,439 --> 00:44:18,200
He's just become, he doesn't have free will, that's sure.

518
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:24,920
He's just become part of the general movement of the universe.

519
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,920
He's merged with God.

520
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:35,239
And now, that's now that I want to say, that's the breakdown of the medieval synthesis.

521
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,840
Unless St.

522
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:52,679
Thomas could do it better, which I don't know enough to be able to have an opinion of, Dante, who's pretty smart, I think, and does it very well, as best he can, ends up in something which seems to me a kind of nihilism.

523
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,760
I have to explain now what I mean.

524
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:58,039
There's something which is really Christian nihilism.

525
00:44:58,039 --> 00:45:00,599
Kierkegaard, a kind of despair.

526
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:02,840
But it's already here in God.

527
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,279
And U2 writes about it.

528
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,880
The music of U2.

529
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,479
I should have brought in a quote.

530
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,640
How many of you listen to U2?

531
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:21,600
Oh, I'll bring in a quote next time where they talk about how somebody took, they talk about how the girl looked into the sun and forgot them.

532
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,679
And that's the same experience.

533
00:45:25,999 --> 00:45:34,160
So anyway, Dante's got this experience in which if you push it to the limit, which he does, all meaning gets leveled.

534
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:36,560
It isn't that all meaning goes away.

535
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:40,080
That would be modern nihilism, not Christian nihilism.

536
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:46,959
But what happens is there's nothing any more meaningful than anything else.

537
00:45:46,959 --> 00:45:52,719
Everything is equally meaningful, which in a certain sense makes everything equally unmeaningful.

538
00:45:53,280 --> 00:46:02,560
What you want is things that stand out as special, like Beatrice or the Guelphs or the Ghibellines in the politics of Florence.

539
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:06,879
And all that gets leveled by God.

540
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:15,839
Everything finite, historical, political, embodied, even Jesus doesn't matter anymore.

541
00:46:17,439 --> 00:46:22,800
And that's what happens with a super monotheism.

542
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,519
I just put it here, finally summing it up.

543
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:31,200
In this kind of monotheism, no creature has any special meaning.

544
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:35,920
So either all, I mean, all the creatures are just equally meaningless.

545
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,399
Yeah.

546
00:46:36,959 --> 00:46:37,439
What?

547
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,159
That's true.

548
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:58,080
Okay, I I I think they're right, but I think I could turn it around and say something like this.

549
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:02,160
I mean, you can have this mystical vision in your life.

550
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:06,959
And if you do, and it is the highest thing you can have, and the sooner you have it, the better.

551
00:47:06,959 --> 00:47:24,279
And if you add all that, at least it's true that the the most sort of fulfilled and worthy person would be living in the world in this strange way that I picture Dante living in the world after his mystical vision.

552
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:28,840
And if your story would work if it was half work, I think.

553
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,159
I like it that you're you're trying for him.

554
00:47:31,959 --> 00:47:40,200
Your theory would half work if you couldn't have this vision that totally satisfied you and you couldn't turn away from it in this life.

555
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,320
That would be the first move.

556
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:50,840
Then at least in this life, things would be meaningful for you and there would be more important meaning and less important meaning and things that are really tremendously meaningful.

557
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,039
That's good.

558
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:55,639
But I think Dante thinks you can have this experience in this life.

559
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:56,759
I think that's what St.

560
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,039
Bernard is supposed to have had.

561
00:47:58,039 --> 00:48:00,680
It makes him the guide at the end.

562
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:01,559
But let's do it.

563
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,439
Let's suppose you can't have this vision.

564
00:48:04,439 --> 00:48:09,479
Then it follows, as you say, that things in your world would be relevant.

565
00:48:09,479 --> 00:48:11,959
Some would be more important than others.

566
00:48:11,959 --> 00:48:13,160
That's fine.

567
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:20,200
But then you get the peculiar f result that in the afterlife, things are less meaningful.

568
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:24,519
You get a meaningful life, but then you get a nihilistic afterlife.

569
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,479
It's a peculiar phenomenon.

570
00:48:27,479 --> 00:48:30,760
Because in the afterlife, there isn't anymore.

571
00:48:31,479 --> 00:48:35,239
Dante can't even look at Beatrice anymore and so forth.

572
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:42,519
None of the old meaningful things are preserved, which is a funny view of the afterlife, because you you're supposed to get in the afterlife the the truth.

573
00:48:42,479 --> 00:48:45,320
Aha ha, what a wonderful move I'm about to make.

574
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,319
But I'm pleased with it.

575
00:48:47,320 --> 00:49:12,080
I mean, i if it's true that Dante reveals the the truth of whatever existence you had by the eternal significance of it, and you get it in the afterlife, the bad people get the true awfulness of their lives forever, and the good people get the true bliss of their lives forever, then what you get, the truth of it all, is still this kind of nihilism.

576
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:13,599
That is, you don't like that.

577
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:15,680
I mean, how can you avoid that?

578
00:49:17,999 --> 00:49:18,559
That's nice.

579
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:22,160
Do you get enjoyment anymore?

580
00:49:22,479 --> 00:49:26,079
I'm sure that all those.

581
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,360
Aha.

582
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,320
Okay.

583
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:39,199
I'm so glad I handed out page 250 and 251 because he says that all the politics in Florence, all the life on earth he now sees as meaningless.

584
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:50,479
It's as if you're a racing car driver, looking back at all the stress and strain and risk of his life and so forth, now sees that that was all trivial.

585
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,599
And maybe that's the way to put the mistake.

586
00:49:54,479 --> 00:49:55,920
Okay, he shouldn't say that.

587
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,760
I mean, you're doing okay.

588
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,319
But something in the system, I'm not sure I understand really what it is.

589
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:16,720
I guess that namely, simply that this monotheistic creator God, after all, must be completely satisfying that makes everything retroactively trivial once you see that.

590
00:50:18,479 --> 00:50:19,360
I see what you're saying.

591
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,640
You see what I'm saying?

592
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:24,719
Okay, so, but you pushed me, fine, I'm happy.

593
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:30,959
I mean, you pushed me to make as clear a case as I can for what I call medieval nihilism.

594
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,880
It's, I mean, it's the everything-leveled view.

595
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,679
Nietzsche calls it monotonotheism.

596
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:45,319
And Kierkegaard talks about leveling, but it is certainly an amazing phenomenon.

597
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:48,439
Let me just catch up with after that good discussion.

598
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:56,680
So once you get direct access to the Creator, then everything else doesn't matter anymore.

599
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:06,760
And that makes medieval monolithic monotheism essentially a kind of leveling nihilism.

600
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:08,840
And I've just been saying that.

601
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:17,720
So that is human beings, history, politics become, you see the truth of them, and you see that they are and always were trivial.

602
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,839
That's what I'm claiming anyway.

603
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,040
Now let's see.

604
00:51:23,959 --> 00:51:28,439
So God as supreme being and creator has swallowed up everything.

605
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:37,640
And I think that's what happens if you put Christianity in Greek Aristotelian Platonic terms.

606
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:43,320
And now, good, I have 15 more minutes.

607
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:45,479
So anybody can say anything if they want.

608
00:51:45,479 --> 00:51:51,320
And then I want to make a kind of transition jump a thousand years to Dante Melville.

609
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,159
Is it a thousand years, 1,300?

610
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:54,760
Not quite.

611
00:51:56,039 --> 00:51:57,640
700 years, right?

612
00:51:57,639 --> 00:51:58,920
500 years.

613
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:04,840
Okay, anyway, Barry did a good job of speaking for the other side.

614
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:14,039
And I think you could maybe reformulate Dante so that he came out on the other side, but there is a version of Christianity that does seem to level everything.

615
00:52:14,039 --> 00:52:15,239
Now, I don't know what St.

616
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:20,199
Thomas did, but I do know that he said that everything he'd written was straw, right?

617
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,079
That's a famous line.

618
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:21,880
Now, why would St.

619
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:28,079
Thomas, having written this amazing synthesis, which transformed or formed the Middle Ages?

620
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:37,360
I mean, he was a big deal reconfigurer, putting these two totally different traditions together and creating the medieval world.

621
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:45,839
He can declare on his deathbed, presumably because he had a mystical vision, right, that it was all straw.

622
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,999
And that's the same phenomenon.

623
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:51,999
I think it's very consistent of him and Dante to have done it.

624
00:52:51,999 --> 00:53:03,200
Okay, so now I'm switching to how we got to monotheism, to nihilistic monotheism, and what we can do to get out of it.

625
00:53:03,439 --> 00:53:11,920
So I'm just heading toward Moby Dick, and how Moby Dick has got to be the answer to this problem.

626
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,400
But I've got to get there bit by bit.

627
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:24,639
So I'm going to run through the history, I'm going to run through the course, take a running start, and then sort of leap over these 500 years between Dante and Melville.

628
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:48,639
So I'm just reminding you that in Homer, there was a plurality of gods and a plurality of worlds and a plurality of meanings, different things grabbing different people at different times and different things grabbing the same people at different times, like Helen from erotic runaway lover to a perfect wife, peerless among women, giving the perfect dinner party.

629
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:54,400
I mean, different things at different times is the essence of Homer, and they all can be meaningful.

630
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:57,360
But there's a steady drift in our culture.

631
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,799
That's what this course is about: from gods to God and back.

632
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,080
We just got to God, I mean, absolute God.

633
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:16,200
And so there are some steps that you go from totally plural worlds like in Homer to there being only two important worlds, the Furies and Apollo, in Aeschylus.

634
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:27,959
And indeed, in Aeschylus, you're already, the tendency is somehow to get them to cooperate, not to get them to sort of assimilate each other, but at least to get them to understand and cooperate.

635
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:35,959
What looked like a conflict between worlds turns out to be able to be sort of stable.

636
00:54:35,959 --> 00:54:38,920
It only lasts, if it turns out, 50 years.

637
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:51,400
But then you go further, and you get in Virgil a kind of unity that's supposed to be take up the history of Rome and project the history of Rome all unified around Augustus.

638
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,800
And it's supposed to last a thousand years.

639
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,680
It didn't, but it lasted an awfully long time.

640
00:54:57,639 --> 00:55:09,320
And then finally you get Dante, who thinks that there is one total unified created creation.

641
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:15,400
It determines everything, and it has this leveling effect.

642
00:55:16,999 --> 00:55:23,639
And now to put it another way, just to save the parallel thing, for Homer, there wasn't just a plurality of worlds, of course.

643
00:55:23,639 --> 00:55:25,400
There was a plurality of gods.

644
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,880
I'm just running through it again.

645
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:58,240
Now in Aeschylus, what's interesting to me about Aeschylus isn't, if you remember this, that there are two different divine forces, the Apollonians and the Furies, but there's some god in the background, where Aeschylus says this important thing, something I know not what is behind it all, something behind it all about which he can't say anything.

646
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:09,680
And that's interesting, because that made him able to see that psychology was not what was important.

647
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:13,200
Individuals and their desires weren't important.

648
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:37,920
But what was important was this understanding of being, as Heidegger would call it, in the background practices, which made it possible for people to experience gods like Apollo and gods like the Furies and experience themselves as the patriotic Athenians who were able to hold them all together.

649
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:43,679
He recognized that is Aeschylus that in some sense, by the way, if you don't get all this, don't worry.

650
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:50,719
This is sort of high-level, abstract, really upper-division course for ontology.

651
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:55,680
But I just want to sort of tell it to you, and then you can, you don't feel you need to know it for your papers.

652
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:03,040
The cultural background, but then you see that there is some cultural background more basic than the desires of the individual.

653
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:04,880
But then what happens?

654
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:09,120
Well, what Aeschylus saw gets lost.

655
00:57:09,439 --> 00:57:23,680
And so you get in Virgil all about psychological desires of individuals, Aeneas and Ido, and how Aeneas has to do his duty, and Dido has this fatal love for Aeneas, and so forth and so forth.

656
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:32,720
The background that the Greeks saw, the Romans forgot, got hidden, got covered up.

657
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:41,959
All that Virgil saw was the importance of the emperor, and he was the governor of men and produced a political, stable political world order.

658
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:59,160
The background is still there because it's the background of the way people act and think which makes it possible for there being to be a world in which you could think that Augustus could govern it and that that would be all that was going on.

659
00:57:59,159 --> 00:58:07,240
And you wouldn't see the shared understanding in the way people behave that was making that go on.

660
00:58:08,439 --> 00:58:10,199
But that's how it is.

661
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,479
Desires and psychology become central.

662
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:19,560
And then in Dante, the background gets hidden even more.

663
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:42,599
The background which gives, that is this cultural understanding that gives everything its meaning and determines what it makes sense to do, and this is the crucial move, gets replaced by something, namely the supreme being, that has this job of giving everything its meaning, of determining what is intelligible, of determining what it makes sense to do.

664
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:45,320
All that gets put on God the Creator.

665
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:48,840
Heidegger called Heidegger has a word for that.

666
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:53,319
And that's what the Course is, you know, from, I keep saying from gods to God and back.

667
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:57,800
We have now arrived at what Heidegger calls onto theology.

668
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,560
Onto theology.

669
00:58:59,559 --> 00:59:10,840
Heidegger made up this term, and that means a being is God.

670
00:59:11,159 --> 00:59:13,239
That's the Supreme Being.

671
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:17,160
God as Supreme.

672
00:59:17,479 --> 00:59:19,479
I don't know how to spell Supreme, but that's all right.

673
00:59:19,479 --> 00:59:20,039
You couldn't read.

674
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:20,840
I can't.

675
00:59:21,159 --> 00:59:22,199
Let's try again.

676
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:26,479
S-U-P-R-E-M, Supreme Being.

677
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:34,080
So now, the question becomes: how to get out of onto theology.

678
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:58,640
We're stuck in this, and we could be stuck in this view that there has to be, that everything is all given its meaning by this super being, which means in effect that everything loses its meaning, and means that the way the meaning is sustained by people and their culture and their commitments and their works of art has all been covered up.

679
00:59:59,519 --> 01:00:04,959
And so the understanding of ontology has gone underground.

680
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:12,879
The background practices that govern everything, make sense of everything, make it that we believe in a creator.

681
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:23,920
They believe in a creator God, which is the ultimate source of meaning, and they don't see that that's just another understanding of being, another stage of the culture.

682
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:24,719
They're in it.

683
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,080
They think that's it.

684
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:27,360
We've got this supreme being.

685
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,120
It's always, it's eternal.

686
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:31,520
And we don't have to do anything.

687
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:34,160
We just contemplate it.

688
01:00:34,159 --> 01:00:36,800
And that's where we are now.

689
01:00:37,999 --> 01:00:44,160
People don't understand anymore that it's up to them to give the world meaning in some sense.

690
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:50,000
And they don't understand that it's fragile, that it's wonderful, that anything makes sense at all.

691
01:00:49,999 --> 01:00:53,680
All that's now hidden, that the Greeks understood.

692
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:59,439
There's no place anymore for things welling up to talk again like the understandings of being.

693
01:00:59,439 --> 01:01:06,800
There's no place for people thinking of their job as poesis, of bringing things out into their own and nourishing them.

694
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:13,240
They don't even think of themselves as producers that produce and impose order like the Romans.

695
01:01:07,439 --> 01:01:19,240
They think of themselves as vessels that will be to be fulfilled.

696
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:21,400
And they are all fulfilled.

697
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:28,360
That is, these vessels are filled when they are looking at this divine radiance period.

698
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:31,320
Now, okay, I still got five minutes.

699
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:32,039
That's great.

700
01:01:32,039 --> 01:01:36,840
Because now, having, there are several stages after that.

701
01:01:37,159 --> 01:01:50,119
I mean, we don't, the culture didn't just go bang from the understanding of being, the onto theological understanding of being, and everything being creatures, to Moby Dick onto Melville.

702
01:01:50,119 --> 01:01:51,959
So what happened in between?

703
01:01:51,959 --> 01:02:05,560
Well, what happened was, instead of God being the supreme being, Descartes flipped things around and said, each of us is the source of meaning.

704
01:02:05,559 --> 01:02:06,679
We are subjects.

705
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,200
I said that before.

706
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:11,719
You're used to being subjects, and everything is objects.

707
01:02:12,519 --> 01:02:14,920
That's a whole new understanding of being.

708
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:22,679
We put the, or Descartes put, well, with a little help from Luther, and Pascal, let me fill you in a bit.

709
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:36,359
So Luther comes along and turns against the church, makes Jesus the center thing, says that every man is a Pope, that you don't need the church, that each individual can relate directly to Jesus.

710
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,880
I think this is looking worried.

711
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:41,720
My Protestantism is not all that it might be.

712
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:50,359
And Pascal comes along, I feel more at home with Pascal, is saying that God, our God, is a hidden God.

713
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,199
It's a very important move.

714
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:55,760
You can't stand in God's radiance anymore.

715
01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:05,840
I mean, I think Luther, I don't know what Luther said, but Luther should have said, following the Gospel of John in one of his ways, that when you've seen Jesus, you've seen the Father.

716
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:21,119
That stops this sort of radiance that blasts you out of everything finite and meaningful and embodied and so forth, because Jesus is finite and meaning embodied, and that's the object of adoration, and then everything is all right.

717
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:23,439
What's that?

718
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:24,880
He does.

719
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:25,679
Luther says that.

720
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,119
We've got to read Luther in this course.

721
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:28,880
He's going to be an important figure.

722
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:40,319
And Pascal is terrific, saying that it's just Greek and wrong to think that being in the presence of God with all this radiance is what Christianity is about.

723
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:48,880
Christianity, Pascal says, thinks that you never get directly related to a God that is overwhelming and fully present.

724
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,120
That's exactly what it doesn't say.

725
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:59,840
And again, it says in a way that when you can relate to Jesus, that kind of onto theology isn't available to you.

726
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,920
So now let me see quickly where we are.

727
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:06,959
So we get, and then Kant takes this, we are all givers of meaning.

728
01:04:07,439 --> 01:04:12,400
So we've done, so you go from Luther to Pascal to Descartes.

729
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,679
No, sorry, it doesn't go that way.

730
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:17,600
From Luther to Descartes to Pascal.

731
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:33,519
And then Kant, who puts it all together and says what we are up to, we Enlightenment people, we who have the modern understanding of being to talk the Heidegger jargon, I got, is that autonomy is the highest thing.

732
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,039
That's maturity.

733
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:42,840
That's giving them giving a meaning to your own life, giving yourself your identity, giving your world whatever meaning you choose to give it.

734
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:48,279
It's not quite like that in Kant yet because you've got to do it within the bounds of reason.

735
01:04:48,279 --> 01:04:53,880
But in general, Kant makes autonomy the main thing.

736
01:04:53,880 --> 01:05:01,159
And at that point, and he says maturity and autonomy in the Enlightenment means you don't obey the Pope.

737
01:05:01,159 --> 01:05:05,239
See, Luther's in the background, you don't obey the king, you don't have to.

738
01:05:05,239 --> 01:05:07,159
You freely choose what to do.

739
01:05:07,159 --> 01:05:11,880
You can choose to obey the Pope, you can choose to obey the king, but it's up to you.

740
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:19,319
And now, what happened to the understanding of being in the background making all this possible?

741
01:05:19,319 --> 01:05:21,880
Well, it is utterly forgotten by that.

742
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:25,959
There's just subjects giving meaning to objects.

743
01:05:25,959 --> 01:05:30,599
And in Kant, becoming completely autonomous.

744
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:34,119
And it's become mysterious.

745
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,920
The understanding of being is still there.

746
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:38,519
It's mysterious.

747
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,199
It's hidden.

748
01:05:40,199 --> 01:05:42,840
It's not a super being like God.

749
01:05:43,159 --> 01:05:47,159
It cannot ever be present and understood.

750
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,479
Scales got that right.

751
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:59,880
So, how are you going to portray this background in such a way that, and now comes the fast move.

752
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:19,559
I mean, Melville thinks that not only does, I mean, now I put these words in his mouth, he doesn't think about this, but he would agree with me, I think, that of course medieval supreme being, onto theology, makes everything meaningless.

753
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:37,760
But he also would think that the autonomous subject, giving itself meaning and trying to get control and dominate the world, is getting rid of the sacred and the holy and whatever gives meaning to human life.

754
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:46,800
See, Meilbilt, on my reading, is going to be a return to something like Homeric polytheism.

755
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,239
And he knows that.

756
01:06:48,239 --> 01:07:05,199
And he knows that there's going to have to be something that is very, very important that can never be controlled and understood and grasped and dominated or whatever.

757
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:07,439
I mean, I haven't explained that yet.

758
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,999
We have to start reading the book to see that.

759
01:07:09,999 --> 01:07:10,959
So let me see if I've got.

760
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:13,199
So Meldil is an artist.

761
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,920
He's way ahead of his time.

762
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:28,719
He understands that all forms of monotheism, whether it's God as Supreme Being or the subject, the Kantian autonomous subject as Supreme Being, is nihilism.

763
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:32,719
And he's going to try to help us out of that.

764
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:55,840
He's writing in 1850, and his targets in being in time are Christianity, onto theology, and technology, which he thinks is a new sort of form of organizing everything and forgetting the understanding of being and leveling all meaning.

765
01:07:56,079 --> 01:08:03,680
All I was going to get clear to you when you read it, but I want to just get to one more point just in time.

766
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:04,719
Let's see.

767
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:10,039
So, the technology, he sees that man is taking over the planet.

768
01:08:10,039 --> 01:08:11,559
He talks, you keep your eye open.

769
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:13,159
He talks about that friggin earth.

770
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:18,439
I think he's the first person to think of the earth as an object in space.

771
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:24,199
And he thinks that that's the wrong way to think about the earth.

772
01:08:24,199 --> 01:08:28,359
I mean, not that science doesn't think it's that way, but he doesn't think.

773
01:08:29,079 --> 01:08:30,920
He doesn't feel it that way.

774
01:08:31,239 --> 01:08:38,199
In that way, he's very close to sort of modern, recent ecological.

775
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:58,519
He's close to everything that is just happening now, which is what's fascinating about him, because he wrote in 1850, I mean, 100 years ago, he understood the problem that we have now, which is in some sense a problem of nihilism, that nothing is sacred, nothing is holy, nothing has really great significance.

776
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:03,719
And he understood somehow that onto theology was the cause of it.

777
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:07,639
And he wanted to save the sacred and the holy.

778
01:09:07,959 --> 01:09:10,439
And this is my final slogan.

779
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:11,880
It's just up.

780
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:23,959
I mean, if you had a slogan for Moby Dick, you should remember that Melville thinks it's possible to love the holy and detest religion as onto theology.

781
01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:27,719
Christianity and Protestantism from his point of view.

782
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:33,639
In fact, if you're going to love the holy, you have to resist the onto theological.

783
01:09:34,279 --> 01:09:41,399
And just to get a slogan, the onto theology is the biggest enemy of whatever the sacred and the holy is.

784
01:09:41,399 --> 01:09:43,239
We don't, I haven't told you yet.

785
01:09:43,239 --> 01:09:47,079
But whatever the sacred and holy is, it's something we can't master.

786
01:09:47,079 --> 01:09:52,880
Okay, now you're ready to start reading Moby Dick and seeing some of this happening.

787
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,920
And of course, this is all very abstract.

788
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:58,239
But when you see it, that's the great thing of a novel.

789
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:01,840
When you read it in Moby Dick, you'll understand it.

790
01:10:01,999 --> 01:10:03,599
You'll see that it's a work of art.
