1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,359
Okay, now I start by quoting page 526 then, where he's where they're talking about that.

2
00:00:08,879 --> 00:00:13,520
The bottom of 526, we're in the middle of the first chase.

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:26,720
And chapter 133, for those who don't have this one, in the middle, roughly the middle of the chapter, a paragraph that I'm going to read.

4
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:37,279
Now, by reason of this untimely spinning around, the boat upon its axis, its bow by anticipation, was made to face the whale's head while yet underwater.

5
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:50,560
But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him, silently transplanted himself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat.

6
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:57,840
And he knocks over the boat and splits it all up through and through and so forth.

7
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,599
And then, let's just read on.

8
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:22,360
Through and through, through every plank and every rib, it thrilled for an instant the whale lying and so forth and so forth, and slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air as one of the teeth caught in a rock lock.

9
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,159
The bluish pearl white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab's head.

10
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:32,759
So it looks like Ahab's going to get a front eyeball to eyeball or head to head.

11
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:43,960
Somebody after class was worried about the fact that the eyes on the whale are on the side, but he seems to be able, the whale, to keep somebody in view simply by getting beside them.

12
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,359
The whale can see things on the side.

13
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,720
You can only get one eyeball at a time confrontation, but that doesn't seem to be a problem.

14
00:01:51,720 --> 00:02:00,680
The bluish so-and-so, in this attitude, the white whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her a mouse.

15
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:11,240
With unastonished eyes, Fadala gazed and crossed his arm, but the tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other's heads to gain the utmost stern.

16
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,960
And it's all this is all this crucial part.

17
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:15,159
I'll just read it all.

18
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:29,479
And now, while both elastic gun walls were springing in and out as the whale dallied with the doomed craft in his devilish way, so it looks like he's the this is the malicious intelligence whale, you see.

19
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:39,159
And from his body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from the bows, for they were almost inside him, as it were, and so forth.

20
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:45,800
Then it was that monomaniac Ahab, I mean, we've heard him called monomaniac by me lots of times.

21
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,879
I don't remember how often or whether already, but he is, of course, monomaniac.

22
00:02:52,120 --> 00:03:17,680
Furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated, frenzied with all this, he seized the long bow with his naked hand, long bone, that is, the jaw, with his naked hands, and wily strove to wrench it, to wrench it from its grip, that is, to get the whale to let loose of his boat.

23
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:34,000
And now he thus vainly, as now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him, and then everything collapsed and so forth, and things broke into pieces and fell apart.

24
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And Ahab saw what the whale was up to, the next paragraph.

25
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,879
Ahab, first to perceive the whale's intent, loosened his hold for the time.

26
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,360
At that moment, he pushed the boat out of the bite.

27
00:03:51,360 --> 00:04:09,120
But instead, he only slipped further into the whale's mouth, but skipping now to the top of 528, but soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam softly round and round the wrecked crew, sideways turning the water in his vengeful wake.

28
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:21,519
So this interpretation has him malicious and angry and toying with them intelligently, as if lashing himself up for still another and more deadly assault.

29
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:29,840
And round and round, then he swam round and round Ahab, who became the center of things at the next, at the end of that paragraph.

30
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:39,680
With straining eyes, the men, that is, they, remained on the outer edge of the direful zone whose center had now become the old man's head.

31
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:47,079
And that's, and then after that, the whale just swam off.

32
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,279
Let's read a little more.

33
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:55,800
But struggling out again, he shouted, Sail on the whale, drive him off.

34
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,160
The Pequads, so they got the big ship involved.

35
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:06,279
The Pequad's prows were pointed, and breaking up the charmed circle, she effectively parted the white whale from his victim.

36
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:10,600
As he sullenly swam off, the boats flew to the rescue.

37
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:17,400
Okay, there he is, vengeful, sullen, malicious, and so forth, and devilish.

38
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:19,399
I'm just catching all the things.

39
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,959
And out to get Ahab.

40
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:28,440
Finally, that they save Ahab by separating the Mobidig from Ahab.

41
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:36,600
And he swims off sullenly, presumably because his malicious intentions have been frustrated.

42
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:38,600
And he's annoyed.

43
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:45,560
All very kind of personified, evil, just what Ahab thought he was.

44
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,120
And in a way, Ahab should be happy about it.

45
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,279
It looks like he's very much concerned about Ahab.

46
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:59,639
But the second day, we go from malicious intelligence to just awkward intelligence.

47
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,120
And that starts on 536.

48
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,240
By the way, if anybody wants to add anything or say anything, just do it.

49
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:17,000
There's time to cover the three, and I don't know if I've got all the point or the details of each chase as we do it.

50
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,399
But until you say anything, I will go on.

51
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:24,440
I'm now on chapter 134, the chase, second day.

52
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:46,560
And so into that chapter a ways, about halfway, a little more than halfway, I'm going to start reading in the middle of a paragraph that begins while the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out for the oars and so forth.

53
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:53,440
Well, I guess I should say, where does it happen that Moby Dick must have got rid of their boat again?

54
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,079
They've lowered away for the boat on the previous page.

55
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:10,319
Though Moby did, so as if to strike the middle of 535, as if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned and was now coming for the three crews.

56
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:23,039
Ahab's boat was central, and cheering his men, he told them he would take the whale head and head, that is, pull straight up to his forehead, and a not uncommon thing, and so forth and so forth.

57
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,839
But ere that close limit was gained, I'm on 535 below the middle.

58
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:52,560
And while yet all three boats were plain as the ship's three masts to his eye, the white whale, churning himself into furious speed, almost in an instant, as it were, rushing among the boats with open jaws and lashing tail, offered appalling battle on every side, and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat, seemed intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made.

59
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:59,520
But skillfully maneuvered, instantly wheeling like trained charges in the field, the boats for a while eluded him.

60
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:07,360
But then finally, we can skip a little, he just starts thrashing around and trashing every boat.

61
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:10,079
And where shall I start again?

62
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,520
On 536, at the middle of the middle of the bottom paragraph.

63
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:19,800
Ahab's yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up toward heaven by invisible wires.

64
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,640
He comes at the boat from the bottom.

65
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:36,920
As arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly from the sea, the white whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom and sent it turning over and over into the air till it fell again, gun whale downward, and Ahab and his men struggled out from under it like seals from a sea cave.

66
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:44,760
Now, now becomes the sort of indifference of Moby Dick.

67
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:54,680
The first unuprising moment of the whale, modifying its direction as it struck the surface, launched him along a little distance from the center of the destruction.

68
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,680
And so he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes.

69
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,959
I'm at the top of 537 from side to side.

70
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:11,640
And whenever a stray oar, bit, of plank, or the least crumb or chip of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back and came sideways, smiting the sea.

71
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:24,520
As soon as if satisfied with his work for the time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the ocean and trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his leeward way at a traveler's methodic pace.

72
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:40,280
Now, so instead of focusing his attention on Ahab this time, Moby destroys all the boats and destroys Ahab's boat last, and then just goes off and doesn't seem to be interested in Ahab.

73
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:47,079
He seems to be just awkwardly, without knowing what he's hitting, threshing around with his tail.

74
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:51,319
It doesn't seem that he's meant to do what he did.

75
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,120
Sort of random violence this time.

76
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,440
And after having enough random violence, he just goes away.

77
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,760
Only one important plot thing has happened.

78
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,040
The Farsi is found to be missing.

79
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:14,800
And the Farsi in the prophecy is going to, it goes, will die ahead of Ahab.

80
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,760
And now the fact that he's missing is very upsetting and important.

81
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:26,160
He seems to have been dragged under by Moby Dick, pulling Ahab's line.

82
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:32,960
This confirms the Farsi's prophecy that he would go before Ahab to his death.

83
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,680
So much for the second round.

84
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:48,000
Now, the third round is of that he's not only sort of awkward, so there was malicious intelligence, then there was this kind of awkward intelligence.

85
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:57,840
I mean, he seemed to know what he was doing, but it doesn't seem like he's very focused on Ahab or focused on the Pequad when he's doing it.

86
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,200
But he seems to be intelligent because he's satisfied with his work for the time.

87
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:08,079
That sounds like, well, he wanted to destroy all the boats that he did, and that was that.

88
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,160
So that's what I'm calling awkward intelligence.

89
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:19,599
But that's not as indifferent as the third one, where he does, and the third one is really the punchline.

90
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:31,680
I mean, if you're trying to figure out, well, is Ahab going to get a confrontation with him, or is Ahab going to discover that he's indifferent or discover that he's malevolent?

91
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,839
How is Melville going to end this chase thing?

92
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,319
Well, I don't know how many did get there.

93
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:40,080
How many have got to it?

94
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,040
Not so many.

95
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,600
Okay, well, I have to read the last one now.

96
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:53,480
The third day is peculiar.

97
00:11:53,479 --> 00:12:02,199
Ahab's now aware that he's doomed because the prediction says that once the Farsi dies, he's going to die afterwards.

98
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:11,719
But he's still trying to get a personal confrontation because he hasn't had that yet, although he seems always sort of almost to have it.

99
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:21,719
On page 542, now of chapter 135, the third day of the chase, he says near the beginning, how near?

100
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:30,839
Two pages in, the paragraph, forehead to forehead I meet thee this third time, Moby Dick, Ahab says.

101
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:34,840
So now it looks like he's really going to get a confrontation.

102
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:36,360
And lots of stuff happens.

103
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:49,160
Then in 548, the whale sort of attacks Ahab's boat.

104
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:51,640
I'll start at the top of 548.

105
00:12:51,640 --> 00:13:07,079
And when Ahab cried out to the steerman to take new turns with the line and hold it so and commanded the crew to turn around on their seats and tow the boat up to the mark, the moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and tug, it snapped in the empty air.

106
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:13,800
What breaks in me some sinew cracks, tis hole again, oars, oars, and so forth, burst on.

107
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,479
But then the middle of the next paragraph, what about Moby Dick?

108
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:30,560
Well, seemingly seeing in it the source of his persecution, bethinking it may be a larger and nobler foe, of a sudden he bore down upon its advancing prow.

109
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,520
The whale turns toward the Pequad now, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.

110
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,120
Oh, I'm sorry, I knew I missed the crucial line.

111
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:43,040
That's 547.

112
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,359
He hasn't got to the Pequad yet.

113
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:47,279
He's getting first, he turns on Ahab.

114
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,920
The paragraph that begins, at length the craft was cast to one side and so forth.

115
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:58,079
And then Ahab finally throws the harpoon at Moby Dick.

116
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,920
This is the crucial line for that.

117
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:06,160
He darted his fierce iron and his far fiercer curse into the hated whale.

118
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,240
And then what happens?

119
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,760
All sorts of things happen and people get thrown around.

120
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,120
But I can't find the crucial.

121
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,560
Oh, it hasn't happened yet.

122
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,160
That's why I can't find it.

123
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:26,800
So on page 550, Ahab gets another chance.

124
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,599
The paragraph that begins, I turn my body from the sun.

125
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:33,999
He says, Toward thee I roll, though all-destroying but unconquering whale.

126
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:37,599
To the last I grapple with thee, from hell's heart I stab at thee.

127
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:40,960
For hate's sake, I spit my last breath at thee.

128
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,120
And then what's going to happen?

129
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:55,040
I mean, now it's finally got to either, he's either got to confront Moby Dick in an indifferent way or a head-on way and so forth, but none of that happens.

130
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:57,520
He throws the harpoon.

131
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,839
He says, thus I give up the spear.

132
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,040
Then what happens?

133
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,319
The harpoon was darted.

134
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:05,040
The stricken whale flew forward.

135
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,040
With igniting velocity, the line ran through the groove, ran foul.

136
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,640
Ahab stooped to clear it.

137
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,440
He did clear it.

138
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:14,360
But the flying turn caught him around the neck.

139
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:25,319
And voicelessly, as Turkish mutes bolstering their victim, he was shot out of the boat ere the crew knew he was gone.

140
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:29,879
And not only did the crew not know he was gone, he didn't know he was gone.

141
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:39,159
What happens was he gets killed, strangled by Moby Dick without him knowing what happened and without Moby Dick knowing what happened.

142
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:46,680
It's just a sudden accident that he gets caught in the line and with the rope around his neck gets dragged out of the boat.

143
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,999
It's interesting that Melville has all this in mind.

144
00:15:48,999 --> 00:16:01,319
You notice how much this sounds like the blade of grass as the Turks, Turkish mutes bolstering their victim.

145
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:05,800
I mean, I guess, I mean, that doesn't help clear it up.

146
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:31,640
But I mean, it turns out, all I can say is, as indifferent as a mower cuts down a blade of grass, so it looks like Moby Dick kills Ahab, but without any recognition of Ahab as an enemy or without even or indifference, he doesn't even sort of turn around and slim away from Ahab.

147
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,560
He doesn't even know he killed Ahab.

148
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,320
Ahab doesn't know he was killed.

149
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,999
It couldn't be a more meaningless seeming death.

150
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:42,279
That's the crucial thing for this, I think.

151
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:48,519
And that's, let's stop with that until I say a little more about it.

152
00:16:49,719 --> 00:17:01,360
So I'm going to go back to the fact that Moby Dick was on his way toward the Pequad, whom he thought when he strangled and dragged along Ahab without even paying any attention to Ahab.

153
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:02,880
We have to come back to that in a minute.

154
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,719
But first, let's see now.

155
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:18,959
So this is this: so you're listening, and you hear Ahab say this is his last time to kill Moby Dick head-on, and it turns out Moby Dick kills him in a kind of simple animal panic without knowing that he's done it.

156
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,879
So it looks like indifference is the last version about the universe.

157
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,160
But I think it's important that it's sort of accidentally the last version.

158
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,719
It isn't the truth about the universe.

159
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,479
It's just another perspective.

160
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:43,999
I mean, among the malicious behavior, the swinging around Ahab behavior, and then there is the killing Ahab without any purpose.

161
00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:54,799
I don't think you're supposed to think that, okay, now we understand there's one right interpretation of the universe as embodied in Moby Dick.

162
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,640
It's indifferent.

163
00:17:57,199 --> 00:17:59,280
That's sort of Camus metaphysics.

164
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,879
And just to take it, I mean, that's, in the plague, Camus, how many read The Plague?

165
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,479
I mean, Camus tells you, and they realize, that the universe is indifferent, period.

166
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:12,080
That's the right perspective.

167
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,039
I mean, that's the one that counts.

168
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:20,640
I mean, the priest tries to give another perspective, and the doctor tries to give another perspective.

169
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:26,079
But it's clear that Camus thinks he knows the answer about this universe.

170
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,839
Well, that's not the Melville thing.

171
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,680
He's not, I think, supposed to be telling you, finally, we see that that's the right one.

172
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,080
That would be a particular interpretation.

173
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,239
That would be a particular color.

174
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:43,559
That would be a metaphysical, total understanding.

175
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,640
No, that's just the last one.

176
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:48,360
And that's all you can say about it.

177
00:18:51,559 --> 00:19:05,479
It just still comes out indifferent, but it comes out indifferent in Melville, not as being the right answer, but it being in a way like whiteness.

178
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:19,079
It seems to be the canceling out of all the answers, so that there is none, no right answer to the question of how we relate to the universe and it relates to us.

179
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:33,319
That's how, I mean, I'm not sure about this, and if people want to write paper topics better explaining what's going on or taking or disagreeing with me about what's going on, I'll be happy to see them.

180
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:43,719
But that's where I'm going to stop about the chase, unless any of you who have read it or have thoughts about it that contradict what I'm saying.

181
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:50,600
There's in the end, it's a kind of letdown, but that's the point, I think.

182
00:19:50,600 --> 00:20:06,119
I mean, that you keep expecting finally there's an eyeball to eyeball confrontation, and either he gets a chance, a have to throw his harpoon right into the forehead of Moby Dick, or Moby Dick gets a chance to chew off his other leg or something.

183
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,959
You expect some significant encounter.

184
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:17,320
And the important thing is, I think, that you don't get any one significant encounter.

185
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:17,719
Yeah.

186
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,800
He would die by him?

187
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,520
Yeah.

188
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,680
Oh, he does fulfill the prophecy, right?

189
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,039
And the farsi goes before.

190
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,039
And we see the Farsi, don't we?

191
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:30,000
I just suddenly don't remember.

192
00:20:30,719 --> 00:20:34,319
Tied to the Moby Dick by getting caught in the rope.

193
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,800
And Ahab, do we see Ahab again after the rope gets him around the neck?

194
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,999
I don't think so.

195
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,600
But it's and predict and fulfilling the prophecy.

196
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,800
I see why you're saying it.

197
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:51,440
It's a funny thing about the universe that the Farsi can know what's going to happen.

198
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,080
I have nothing to say about that, I'm afraid.

199
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:16,400
Generally, as you know, I haven't said anything about these mysterious but Farsi figures that stand around and sort of keep Ahab in his mono mood and in his maniac mono mood.

200
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,520
And they, with their Sfadala, and he's the main one, right?

201
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:27,599
And he's the one who finally predicts that he will die and then does.

202
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,360
And I'd say just totally mysterious.

203
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:43,600
What somebody in the class is going to write about the Zoroastrian religion that's sort of in the background about what I don't know if Melville knows anything about Zoroastrian religion.

204
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,760
For all I know, he's just bluffing.

205
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:53,680
But at least it would be interesting to know what he might have said and even maybe what he does know and understand.

206
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:58,800
And maybe that casts some light on the prophecy, but I fear not.

207
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,920
So it's a loose end for me.

208
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:10,640
I mean, anything, I mean, I'm sure that Melville is just having literary kind of fun.

209
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,600
It reminds you of the end of Macbeth, and I think it's supposed to.

210
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:31,559
I mean, you get a prophecy that Macbeth can only die after if Vernon Woods moves on Duncanay, and he could only be, and no man born of woman will kill him, and then he discovers the Woods is moving, and then he discovers that who kills him?

211
00:22:33,239 --> 00:22:34,999
Whoever it is, Macduff.

212
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,920
Macduff isn't born of woman, he was born of a Caesarean, and so forth.

213
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:47,160
So this complicated prediction at the end of Macbeth comes true, and I don't think Shakespeare has any interesting views about it.

214
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,879
It's just a literary event, and I don't think Melville has anything interesting about it either.

215
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:56,599
It's a literary event, sort of copying Shakespeare, whom he likes a lot.

216
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:01,479
I don't find that very illuminating, what I'm saying, but I wish I could say something more.

217
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:02,920
But I'm glad you asked.

218
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,759
Sorry, I can't say something that would be helpful.

219
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,959
David, do you want to say something you look like you might?

220
00:23:10,199 --> 00:23:14,039
No, the kind of how the difference remains.

221
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,680
If there is no signal, I don't mind.

222
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,319
I mean.

223
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,199
That's right.

224
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:25,160
Well, that's what I think.

225
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,119
That's right.

226
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,680
That's right.

227
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,199
But what I want to say, and I didn't say it very well, so I'm glad you asked.

228
00:23:32,199 --> 00:23:45,319
I mean, I have it written here as a higher order kind of indifference than this metaphysical kind of claim of just that I'm picking on Camus, but you could pick on lots of people, that it's just plain indifference.

229
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:51,560
It's the whiteness that you get from summing up all the perspectives which don't fit together.

230
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:59,360
So, look, he seems to be after Ahab, and he's sullen when he can't get Ahab, and he's vindictive, and he's malicious.

231
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:23,759
And it isn't as if the final fact that he drags Ahab off in the rope without either one of them knowing what hit them, that doesn't settle it on the level of which interpretation is right, but at a higher order, these interpretations all add up to there being no right interpretation, which is the whiteness, which is the indifference.

232
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:30,000
Yes, and how he survives is important and interesting.

233
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:30,959
Let's go to that.

234
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:47,279
Although, I can't say, I wish I could say more about the indifference, but I keep wanting to say that the crucial thing in Melville is how all the interpretations add up to blankness, which doesn't mean that that's on the same level as the other interpretations and it's the right interpretation.

235
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:57,519
It just means that there's a whole lot of interpretations, and none of them get it all together right, and none of them are altogether wrong.

236
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:06,479
They are just all plausible interpretations, and they don't fit together, period.

237
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,199
I'm not doing very well.

238
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:17,360
But there's somehow basic, I mean, it is, but they don't add up to an answer.

239
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,719
The universe is indifferent.

240
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:20,560
There wouldn't be any rainbow in that answer.

241
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:32,799
The answer, the dumb blankness of the whiteness, is that there are lots of, you could say, true interpretations, but there's no one true interpretation.

242
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,959
They don't add up to anything, but that's a different kind of indifference.

243
00:25:36,959 --> 00:26:05,319
It's got more content in it, but that's what the whiteness and the rainbow, that means it's a kind of atheism or of interpretation where you get this answer that the universe doesn't mean any one thing by giving you a lot of different things that it means instead of just saying, look, it's a meaningless universe and it doesn't mean anything.

244
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:17,160
I think you're supposed to think Moby Dick is malicious, and Moby Dick is a dumb brute, and Moby Dick is out to get Ahab, and Moby Dick doesn't care at all about Ahab.

245
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,680
All of that's right.

246
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,480
And at least that's how I want to read it.

247
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:31,479
It's a lot more interesting than to say, and more tied up with the rainbow and the whiteness, than to say, well, finally the bottom line is the universe is indifferent.

248
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:36,519
It's Ahab, but David's point still bothers me.

249
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:40,280
Ahab doesn't get recognition from the universe.

250
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:41,479
That's a fact.

251
00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:46,039
And nothing about the spectrum of colors changes that.

252
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:48,199
What do I want to say about that?

253
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:52,199
The universe is really indifferent to Ahab?

254
00:26:52,199 --> 00:26:53,079
I don't know yet.

255
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,120
Let me think.

256
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,840
That's right.

257
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:01,559
Ahab certainly is a monomaniac trying to find the meaning and his place.

258
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:09,880
And it shows there's no answer to the question of whether the universe is malicious or not malicious, whether there's a God or not a God.

259
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,759
That's a wrong kind of quest.

260
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:22,999
And there's no answer to the question either, I think, of whether there is any special place for Ahab in the universe, which he wants to settle.

261
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:25,080
Because that's the wrong kind of quest.

262
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:32,959
I want it to come out somehow that the answer isn't, well, Ahab, it turns out the universe doesn't care at all about you.

263
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:35,440
The universe is simply indifferent to you.

264
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,080
It somehow isn't the universe.

265
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:43,600
I mean, the way the book is set up, that would have to mean Moby Dick doesn't care about you.

266
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,519
Moby Dick is indifferent to you.

267
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:47,279
But that isn't what happens.

268
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:53,759
When he gets caught in the rope, it doesn't show that Moby Dick is indifferent to him or out to get him.

269
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:59,680
That just shows that none of those answers actually describe what happens.

270
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,800
Is that any hope?

271
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:02,160
I don't know.

272
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,320
I leave it to you all.

273
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,400
If I can do better next time, I will.

274
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:15,199
I'm pretty sure that this is my right track, but I haven't convinced you, I can see, and I haven't, then it's not your fault, it's my fault.

275
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:16,160
Go ahead.

276
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,199
Interesting, interesting.

277
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:21,119
Yes, that's very important.

278
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:35,359
Pip really saw something metaphysical, I'm almost when you say, but that you have to be careful, I mean, because it shouldn't come out that it's like philosophy or religion or metaphysics and that he, that Pip saw the answer.

279
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,160
But he did see something like an answer.

280
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:54,799
He saw that the universe was not made according to any kind of plan, that it was all done by a completely indifferent kind of random weaving.

281
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,160
And that turns out to be true.

282
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,759
Showing the randomness.

283
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:06,640
Right.

284
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,719
And showing that the universe doesn't care.

285
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,640
Yes, but there's something, and I think you're right.

286
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:18,199
That's important.

287
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:24,759
I mean, there is something right about, and that's what David's saying too, and maybe others.

288
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:38,359
But now, if the universe doesn't care, it's somehow a random event, not a particular sort of attitude of the universe.

289
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:52,359
I mean, it's just sort of whether the universe cares or not is an irrelevant question once you've seen that it's made by random coral insects just spinning things together at random.

290
00:29:53,239 --> 00:30:00,840
The main thing is to see the randomness of it, and it's not even indifference.

291
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,000
That's too intentionalistic.

292
00:30:02,999 --> 00:30:11,160
That's too meaningful, as if the universe had some kind of attitude that the universe is just plain random.

293
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,640
That is the final truth.

294
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:15,000
It's chaos.

295
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:16,440
It's indifferent as God.

296
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:21,959
There are things like that that Melville says, and I think that's okay.

297
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:28,759
But that is to, I guess, to say why it's a wicked book.

298
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:33,959
There's not, you can't have the universe is not good with a good God running it.

299
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:37,160
It's not bad with a bad God running it.

300
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,640
It's not sort of indifferent doing its own thing and not caring about us either.

301
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,519
Even that's too specific.

302
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:47,479
The universe just is random.

303
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:48,999
And good.

304
00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:51,080
I think I try to once more.

305
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:59,360
If you say something like Camus, the universe is indifferent, I can't do it yet.

306
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:06,879
I feel that that's attributing some more specific state to the universe than just that it's random.

307
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,680
I guess what I want to say is here, I'm trying again.

308
00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:14,400
When the universe is random, that means sometimes it does care.

309
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:23,359
Sometimes it's lovely and beautiful, and the right mood in the book is to get in sync with the loveliness of nature and the fact that we're all part of it.

310
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,680
And sometimes it's brutal, and then it's like storms.

311
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:45,360
And so to see that it's random is to see that you can get in sync with it and get in moods about it in all sorts of different ways, and that they don't add up to anything, which is different.

312
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,120
You're looking skeptical.

313
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,479
You think I'm on a hopeless track here trying to say this.

314
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,320
That's right.

315
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:54,799
That's good.

316
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:57,519
You're getting, that's what I'm trying to say.

317
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:05,199
But that's a different thing than sort of as if the indifference of the universe were the one right perspective.

318
00:32:05,199 --> 00:32:09,999
There's a kind of randomness of, which makes all the perspectives right.

319
00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:15,279
And that's the interesting thing that Melville is on to.

320
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,199
I think I'm getting better now.

321
00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:24,399
It's not that all the perspectives are wrong or all the perspectives are just perspectives.

322
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:32,880
They are all valid ways of seeing the color, the meaning, and so forth of the universe.

323
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,680
But since they're all equally valid ways, they add up.

324
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:42,680
That's what I want to say again in this meta-way, in this higher way, they do add up to indifference.

325
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:53,080
But they don't, but that's not to deny that all these other perspectives are true of the universe, as true as you can get, because there is no onto theological truth.

326
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,640
There's no truth about the universe.

327
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,799
There are just perspectives.

328
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:04,279
And each perspective reveals something important, and you can get in that mood and get in sync with it.

329
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:09,559
And then I keep repeating: the interestingness thing about it is they don't add up.

330
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:12,760
You can't get better and better grip on the universe.

331
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:15,400
They're just all okay perspectives.

332
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:20,440
On the Nietzsche page that I gave out, give me back one copy of my Nietzsche page.

333
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:33,560
At the bottom, I put a quote from Nietzsche, which comes very close to Melville, but it's not the same as Melville for the reason I've just been groping to try to tell you.

334
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:38,920
So this is getting awfully close.

335
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:44,360
There is only a perspective seeing, I'm at the bottom, only a perspective knowing.

336
00:33:44,360 --> 00:34:02,520
And the more affects, those are the moods, we allow to speak about one thing, the more eyes, different eyes we can use to observe one thing, the more complete will be our concept of this thing, the more complete will our concept of this thing, our objectivity, be.

337
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:06,040
It's the last one that Melville is more radical.

338
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:14,759
There isn't a complete, there isn't even approaching complete objectivity or concepts of things.

339
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,400
You can just go on multiplying interpretations indefinitely.

340
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:25,679
And the reason you can't have a complete one or even converge on is that there are contradictions.

341
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,840
You can have all kinds of contradictory interpretations.

342
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,440
Not, say, of a house.

343
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:31,999
It's true.

344
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,159
You can know more and more about the house.

345
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,799
You can get more and more complete concept of the house.

346
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,240
You can never get a complete one, but you can do that.

347
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:57,279
But when it comes to these big philosophical questions, like what the universe is up to or here for, or what we're up to or here for, then you don't get them adding up to a more and more complete, better and better interpretation.

348
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,519
Because, now let's try to go back to the whale.

349
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:09,200
The malevolence of the whale is there, the stupidity of the whale is there, the awkwardness of the whale is there, the intelligent cleverness of the whale is there.

350
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,400
It's all there.

351
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:17,999
So they've refused to, when you look at it with all these different perspectives, it doesn't get more complete and coherent.

352
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:24,639
It just stays ungraspable, unrepresentable, and so forth.

353
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,599
And it's because at the bottom of it all, it's ungraspable, unrepresentable.

354
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,840
And that's even something more strange than random, I think.

355
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:46,560
Then that means that all these perspectives are true, as I keep saying, as true as you can get.

356
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:52,560
If there was some right answer about the universe, then it might be that some perspectives would be truer than others.

357
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:54,720
But remember back to the doubloon.

358
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,600
There isn't anything, but I look, you look, they look, we look.

359
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,520
Each one sees some aspect.

360
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:07,199
But you don't get, aha, this is, I'm being good about this.

361
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,279
I'm glad I brought back the doubloon.

362
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,679
You don't get a clear picture, finally, of what the balloon is.

363
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,839
What am I trying to say?

364
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:29,800
The dabloon is, you don't, when you add the Ahab dabloom to the stub dabloom to the Starbuck, Starbucks sees three peaks and he sees the Trinity.

365
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,880
Ahab sees himself.

366
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:41,959
Glask or stub, I forget which one sees that you can buy 160 cigars with it because it's a piece of gold and so forth.

367
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:43,959
And which one is right?

368
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:50,520
Well, the way it's supposed to be set up is they're all right as you can get.

369
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:58,200
And none of them write in the normal sense of right that you want to say, well, which corresponds to the way the doubloom really is.

370
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:05,720
So this is a tricky position, but fascinating, I think, that Melville's trying to get explained.

371
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,680
Okay, but I can't explain it anymore anymore.

372
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:11,560
You're still looking worried.

373
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:12,199
No, good.

374
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,759
Well, at least when, and are you still looking worried?

375
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,400
No, okay, I just quit while I'm ahead.

376
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,799
Okay, there's still plenty to talk about.

377
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,840
So let's go back to what happens next.

378
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,880
There's still many fascinating things going to happen.

379
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,160
So what happens with Moby Dick and the Pequad?

380
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:40,440
Well, Moby Dick just seeming, remember, to see that it's the source of all his evil, all the evil.

381
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:41,879
Where is that now?

382
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,360
Okay, Ahab goes down on 550.

383
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,080
And the ship has already gone down, right?

384
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:50,359
That's very bad.

385
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:58,479
Yeah, on page 548, seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions.

386
00:37:58,479 --> 00:38:00,639
And I don't think we're supposed to think seemingly there.

387
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:01,920
I'm still worrying about this.

388
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:03,680
Means, well, it isn't so.

389
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,199
It just seems to be so.

390
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,719
That's a use of seemingly.

391
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,120
No, this is again as so as it can get.

392
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:17,200
I mean, so it, so he sees in it, as far as we can tell, the source of all his persecutions.

393
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:25,999
And bethinking it, it may be, of course, it's alternative, it's just an interpretation, but there's no right answer, so you've got to believe the interpretation.

394
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:37,280
Bethinking it, it may be, a larger and nobler foe of a sudden he bore down upon its advancing prows, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.

395
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:49,120
And that means that we're now later, the ship is going to go down, and it goes down on page 550, I still think.

396
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,840
Where, though, where exactly does it sink?

397
00:38:54,479 --> 00:38:57,199
It sunk by the bottom of 550.

398
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:58,959
It's gone.

399
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:01,600
The ship, great God, where is the ship?

400
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,839
But where did we hear it'll be going down?

401
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:10,320
Okay, let's try the bottom of 549, diving beneath the settling ship.

402
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,760
The whale ran quivering along its keel and so forth.

403
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,920
Shot to the surface again, far from the bow, and so forth.

404
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,200
No, that's not going to do it.

405
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,559
Don't tell me he never actually describes the ship going down.

406
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,479
No, here it's going to go down.

407
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,199
Yeah, going down is the last full paragraph.

408
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,479
I was just stuck to do.

409
00:39:30,479 --> 00:39:34,239
Okay, so then, and there, so now we're going to hear about that.

410
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:44,920
But at the last, whelmings, intermixing, poured themselves over the sunken head of the Indian at the mast, leaving a few inches of the so-and-so erect.

411
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:46,119
Let's skip a little.

412
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:51,320
There was Tashigo there, about ten lines down at the very end of the thing.

413
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:57,239
This, and there's a bird, and he's Tashigo is there at the mast, nailing.

414
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:07,080
It's all very important to get this scramble, what's going on here at the end, because this is another example where something is being said, but not an ordinary sort of thing.

415
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:22,200
So there's the Indian, I'm at the bottom of 550, at the main mast, and he's up there and he's hammering the flag to the mast.

416
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,279
I don't, does it tell us why?

417
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:26,199
I don't think so, so let's go on.

418
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,399
Maybe we'll find out.

419
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:39,959
But a skyhawk that tauntingly had followed the main truck downwards from its natural home among the stars, pecking at the flag and incommoding Tashtigo there.

420
00:40:39,959 --> 00:41:03,720
This bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood, and simultaneously feeling that ethereal thrill, the submerged savage, that's Tashtigo, who's hammering the flag to the mast, the submerged savage beneath in his death grasp, kept his hammer frozen there.

421
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:22,760
And so the bird of heaven, with archangelic shrieks and his imperial beak thrust upward, his whole captive form folded in the flag of Ahab, went down with his ship, which, like Satan, wouldn't sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her and helmeted herself with it.

422
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,119
That there's a new one.

423
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:29,280
We're going to have to spend this today groping around these hard things.

424
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,440
What in the world is going on there?

425
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:32,639
It must be important.

426
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:42,079
I mean, the last thing is that this bird goes down with the ship, and Melville stops with that.

427
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,479
I mean, I'll read the rest, but there's nothing more to say.

428
00:41:44,479 --> 00:41:58,080
Now, small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf, the sullen white surf beat against its steep sides, then all collapsed, and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled 5,000 years ago.

429
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,999
Now, by the way, somebody told me what the 5,000 is.

430
00:42:01,999 --> 00:42:02,799
Do you know why?

431
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,199
Why?

432
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,120
5,000 years ago.

433
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:12,720
I thought it was because, according to the Hebrews, the world was created something like 5,000 years ago.

434
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,840
This is the year 5,000 something in the Hebrew calendar.

435
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:25,360
But somebody told me, and it sounds much more right, that it's the time of the flood was 5,000 years ago if you count back from 1850.

436
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,399
Somebody wants to do it, check it out.

437
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:34,959
But I bet it's the flood, the last time everything was collapsed under the ocean.

438
00:42:34,959 --> 00:42:36,479
But I don't think that's important.

439
00:42:36,479 --> 00:42:39,999
I think that's just a fact that he throws in at the end.

440
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:42,959
I think it's important that this bird goes down.

441
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:50,800
And I don't claim to be sure what it is, but I'll give you an interpretation, and then you can have something to accept or to struggle against.

442
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,440
This is pretty far-fetched and maybe too clever by half.

443
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,520
And if anybody can have a simpler interpretation, I'd be happy to have it.

444
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:05,999
But how he describes the bird is interesting.

445
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:11,560
It's the bird of heaven with its archangel shrieks.

446
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:13,320
That sounds Christian.

447
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:16,199
Archangels and birds of heaven.

448
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:19,160
And his imperial beak thrust upwards.

449
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:21,080
That sounds Roman.

450
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:25,880
And his whole captive form folded in the flag of Ahab went down with the ship.

451
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,600
So, and it's a piece of nature.

452
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:33,800
It seems to be dragging a living part of heaven along with her and helmeted itself with it.

453
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:47,160
It seems to me that what's happening is that everything, something Christian, something Roman, something natural, all goes down with the ship.

454
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:50,520
In fact, everything goes down with the ship.

455
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:52,360
All collapsed.

456
00:43:53,479 --> 00:43:55,240
And what's the idea there?

457
00:43:55,240 --> 00:44:01,799
The idea there, I think, if he's got an idea there, and I have a feeling Melville never has exactly got an idea.

458
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:05,719
He's writing out of this deep feeling he's got.

459
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:33,959
But whatever his feeling there is, that once you get a monotheistic God, which has got the Hebrew archangel component and the Roman imperial component, and all of nature brought into that component, if that God is dead, if that God collapses, if monotheism fails to work, then it's going to take everything down with it.

460
00:44:33,959 --> 00:44:49,800
And to think of it this way, I mean, of course, Christianity goes down with it, and the Hebrews that have fed into Christianity, and modernity and the idea of the autonomous self-replacing God.

461
00:44:49,800 --> 00:45:00,239
All of this is a kind of variation of one monotheism, which has got a Hebrew component, a Greek component, and a Roman component and a modern component, but they're all onto theology.

462
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,920
There is one supreme being that explains it all.

463
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:09,040
And everything is made intelligible in terms of that.

464
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:27,760
Now, it hasn't happened yet, but that combination of Christianity and, as I said last time, technology, which is the modern onto theology, that everything will serve our interests and everything will be brought under control.

465
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,120
All of that gets spread all over the world.

466
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,640
So that already, what's his name?

467
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,880
Quequeg is corrupted.

468
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,399
I mean, you have to ask yourself, and why did Quequeg go down with the boat?

469
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,319
I mean, that's really pretty upsetting.

470
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:46,399
Queque was the nearest thing we got to a human being who was healed.

471
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,959
He was healed when he was in the coffin thinking he was dying.

472
00:45:52,959 --> 00:46:01,200
He was completely blissful and had calm and obviously no anxiety.

473
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,040
And yet he went down too.

474
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:11,840
And remember, he says early on that he's been corrupted by his connection with Christianity, that he can't go back and lead his people anymore.

475
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:17,840
So there's something, even Quequeg has been infected by monotheism.

476
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:24,479
But something about Quequeg is definitely the saving thing.

477
00:46:24,479 --> 00:46:27,280
And you're going to get to that next in a second.

478
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,999
But Quequeg himself has been corrupted.

479
00:46:29,999 --> 00:46:37,120
Though what sort of Quequekweg stands for is the saving power, I think.

480
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:41,079
But anyway, everything goes down is all I want to talk about right now.

481
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,279
It all collapses.

482
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:51,560
And the person who understood that best, Melville is certainly, if he's telling it to us, he's telling it to us in a very cryptic way and a very fast move at the end.

483
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:54,360
The person who really understood it and spelled it out is Nietzsche.

484
00:46:54,360 --> 00:47:04,200
So now I gave you this Nietzsche paper to read you passages which I wanted you to have so you can look back at them.

485
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,959
Don't look at the first passage yet, the great advantage of polytheism.

486
00:47:07,959 --> 00:47:09,160
That's for tomorrow.

487
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,920
I mean, Tuesday.

488
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,559
Look, and then not the brief habits either.

489
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:15,160
That's all for later.

490
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,160
The crucial one right now is the meaning of our cheerfulness.

491
00:47:19,159 --> 00:47:25,240
That's a very funny name for the following passage, which seems anything but cheerful.

492
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:46,760
Okay, the greatest recent event, that God is dead, that the belief in the Christian God has become unbelievable, the event itself, then skipping a lot, that event itself is far too great, too distant, too remote from the multitude's capacity for comprehension, even for the tidings of it to be thought of as having arrived as yet.

493
00:47:46,760 --> 00:48:06,760
Much less, and this is the line that I want to lead up to, much less may one suppose that many people know as yet what this event really means and how much must collapse, very same term, now that this faith has been undermined because it was built upon this faith, propped up by it, growing into it.

494
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,720
For example, our whole European morality.

495
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,320
That's just an example.

496
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:17,639
Everything, according to this Nietzsche picture, finally gets taken over by onto theology and the history.

497
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:22,120
That's the history of the West, and then once it is, it collapses.

498
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,599
And now comes the funny, strange part.

499
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:29,280
That sounds pretty terrible, but after all, it doesn't seem terrible to Melville.

500
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:39,440
I mean, onto theology has gotten to the point where it's monomania in Ahab, where it's sort of turning all the colors of the rainbow into whiteness.

501
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:46,239
And so Melville and Ishmael aren't upset by it, and neither is Nietzsche.

502
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,199
Now he goes on.

503
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:57,679
The consequences, it shouldn't be of ourselves, it should be to ourselves, are quite the opposite of what one might perhaps expect.

504
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,999
They, boy, problems here.

505
00:49:01,999 --> 00:49:13,200
They are not at all sad and gloomy, but rather like a new and scarcely describable kind of light, happiness, relief, exhilaration, encouragement, dawn.

506
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:20,639
Indeed, we philosophers and free spirits feel when we hear the news that the old God is dead, as if a new dawn shone on us.

507
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:32,160
Our hearts overflow with gratitude, amazement, premonitions, and expectation, and then this very Melville conclusion of all that: the sea, our sea, lies open again.

508
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:35,680
Perhaps there has never been such an open sea.

509
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:39,999
And that's the picture.

510
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:46,800
Once you're out of onzootheology, all kinds of new wonderful possibilities will come along.

511
00:49:47,119 --> 00:50:01,999
It's interesting that Balkington is too much still in it by standing against it, this heroic nihilism, sort of in the face of the indifference of the universe.

512
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:11,080
He hasn't got the kind of gratitude, amazement, premonition, expectation.

513
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:15,239
And in his letter to Hawthorne, I wish I had brought it, I didn't think I was going to mention it.

514
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:21,640
He says to Hawthorne, Melville does, I'm not unhappy.

515
00:50:21,959 --> 00:50:23,239
I have to go read it again.

516
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:28,040
I'm not unhappy, but I'm not sort of blissful, I'm content.

517
00:50:29,959 --> 00:50:34,839
There's something very satisfying about the possibilities that are open.

518
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,759
What are the possibilities that are open?

519
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,759
Well, they're the colors of the rainbow.

520
00:50:38,760 --> 00:51:09,319
They're finding the sacred all over that would have been wiped out by this mono-god if it managed to take over all the world, if technology and the Judeo-Christian and Muslim, all those supreme being religions and even not religions like technology, all those mono-activities, if they'd taken all the world, then everything would have gone down.

521
00:51:09,639 --> 00:51:11,880
But not quite everything goes down.

522
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:18,920
I mean, there is the sacred still in all the various parts of the world where it hasn't been destroyed.

523
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:37,240
And it turns out that it's good news that people like Ahab, the view that Ahab lives is what goes down and drags a whole lot of stuff with it, but it really opens up new possibilities.

524
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:46,920
I think that the new possibilities in Nietzsche look pretty different than the new possibilities in Melville.

525
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,159
But I want to save that till next time.

526
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,120
But I want to make sure I cover something else before we get to that.

527
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:57,839
Let's see if I want to say anything about it while I'm at it.

528
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,919
I really need another quote from Nietzsche.

529
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:03,519
Nietzsche, I'm going to find it.

530
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,999
I want to find two more quotes.

531
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,679
One of them I haven't told you about.

532
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:25,599
But this one, I mean, what Nietzsche thinks you should do is disclose new worlds, have new eyes, new ways of thinking about things, new perspectives, that that will be the final satisfaction that you get if you're a free spirit.

533
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,279
I'll give you a quote.

534
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,440
That certainly doesn't seem like Ishmael.

535
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,959
That's too willful.

536
00:52:32,959 --> 00:52:37,119
It's too, it's sort of mono in its own way.

537
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:49,919
It's as if you can, instead of having one world, you've got a whole series of worlds, but it seems like you've got a series of total worlds, maybe.

538
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,440
I'm thinking out loud, and I shouldn't be.

539
00:52:53,999 --> 00:52:55,119
Let's go back to this.

540
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:56,720
I'll talk about that next time.

541
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:01,040
Go back to what's happening here and what is happening here.

542
00:53:01,039 --> 00:53:02,399
Well, there's still more.

543
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,319
The book has an epilogue.

544
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:08,400
And now we're on page 552, the very, very last page.

545
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:18,400
Apparently, I read somewhere, Melville wrote this later because people wanted to know: well, how did Ishmael survive to tell this story?

546
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,440
Or who survived?

547
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:21,999
How do we know all this?

548
00:53:21,999 --> 00:53:27,440
And so he wrote an epilogue saying that Ishmael survived.

549
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,200
And while he was at it, he said lots of interesting things.

550
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,239
So let's do that.

551
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,440
But first, I have to see, I've got my whole section here, Why the Bird?

552
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:40,520
And while you think about Why the Bird, I have to catch up and see whether I've said what I think.

553
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:43,319
I'll just read it one more time.

554
00:53:43,639 --> 00:53:52,600
The moral seems to be that mono-something, I mean, why I want to call it onto theology instead of monotheism.

555
00:53:52,599 --> 00:54:01,080
It's any view that you can somehow understand and control the whole of everything.

556
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:06,840
That has spread to all other cultures and corrupted them.

557
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,160
Everything gets absorbed into it.

558
00:54:09,159 --> 00:54:40,680
And whether it be the monotheism of Dante, where everything has a place in the creation, or the new total view that everything could be ordered by the human will and understood by science, all practices bound up with either of these ways, the Christian, which is the Judeo-Christian, Muslim, theological, or the modern willful scientism, all of those are going to go down.

559
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:44,920
And they've all will become unbelievable.

560
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:49,640
And they take everything down with them.

561
00:54:49,639 --> 00:54:54,440
I said all that, and that this is good news to Melville that it all went down.

562
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,879
Good news to Ishmael.

563
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,640
He's not complaining.

564
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:00,039
Okay, I caught up.

565
00:55:00,039 --> 00:55:01,399
Well, now, the question.

566
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,520
Yeah, David.

567
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:07,719
That's what I meant when I said, yeah, right, when I assumed that much, I shouldn't.

568
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,160
We should tell everybody.

569
00:55:09,159 --> 00:55:29,520
When I say the imperial beak about the bird, the way Christianity took over the world, the first major step, nothing like that has ever been equaled, is they converted an emperor, Constantine, of the Holy Roman Empire, which was the whole known world to Christianity, in what, about 300?

570
00:55:30,479 --> 00:55:39,440
And that's how the imperial story gets together with the archangel story, and that's all going down.

571
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:44,239
And I take it, I keep wanting to say, and nature too is going to go down in the form of the bird.

572
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,440
How does nature go down?

573
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:49,200
Well, the way the whale gets turned into an object and fished out of the ocean.

574
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:55,760
I mean, it isn't going to really happen that everything sinks like this.

575
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,999
But it's going to sink more and more gradually to talk like Nietzsche.

576
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:07,360
The whole Supreme Being, anto-techno story is going to seem more and more implausible.

577
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:19,440
And finally, it's going to seem so implausible that there'll be all this terror of people finding the world unintelligible, having no morality, no to guide them, and so forth.

578
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:27,039
But on the other side of it will be a world that, in a certain sense, will return to Homer-like world.

579
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,519
That would be the happy, that's the, that is the happy result.

580
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,560
But I'll talk about that more tomorrow.

581
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:41,119
But it's the result of the Homer world is plurality of gods, plurality of sacred.

582
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:43,920
Finally, you get out from under the mono.

583
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,759
Remember, the Course is called From Gods to God and Back.

584
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,599
And God just sank.

585
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:52,080
That's to sum it up in one sentence.

586
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:58,479
And now we're going to find out, start talking about saving things.

587
00:56:58,479 --> 00:57:02,159
And so the first thing is, how does Ishmael get saved?

588
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:25,560
Because it's a clue to what is the saving, what is the saving thing that doesn't go down with the archangel Judeo-Christian and doesn't go down with the Roman Catholic Imperial, doesn't go down with nature as what he later calls the disenchanted hill where nature just becomes stuff.

589
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,240
What doesn't go down with it?

590
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:51,080
Well, Ishmael, who's got the right way of life, namely being open to all the moods, which is the cat bird, the catskill eagle that can fly high up and be very happy and low down and be very sorrowful and always open to more and more and interesting and deeper moods.

591
00:57:51,079 --> 00:57:55,240
That doesn't go down and the coffin doesn't go down.

592
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,959
Why is it important the coffin doesn't go down?

593
00:57:57,959 --> 00:58:10,680
Because what's carved on the coffin is the tradition, the background, the culture, the practices, the understanding of being, all these words I use for that.

594
00:58:10,679 --> 00:58:26,760
That is what it is that makes it possible for people to be people and find meaning and treat things in some particular way as creatures or as welling up or as objects or as resources.

595
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:32,120
But the most important thing is, the saving thing is that there is a background.

596
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:34,200
You've got to be grateful for that.

597
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:42,760
And that's, and it isn't, of course, that it isn't perfect, because it isn't as if Quiqueg's tradition saves him.

598
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:46,920
I mean, Quique doesn't know Kwequeg's tradition, and it isn't carved in his body.

599
00:58:46,920 --> 00:59:07,599
But you have to make a sort of jump and say, what saves him is the whatever it is that's carved into people's bodies that they can't understand, but that gives their life general orientation and meaning, and that's summed up in what's carved on Kuikwood.

600
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:15,760
One example is what's carved on Kuique's body, and that is example, is there because it's carved on the coffin.

601
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:24,079
And that's the sense in which Kuique, in a way, survives and is an example of some saving something.

602
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:31,040
All things get very puzzling, and you look very puzzled, and I can well understand.

603
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:33,760
There are two saving somethings.

604
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:36,799
And I've talked about them variously.

605
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,240
Maybe there are three.

606
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,959
I think there are three saving somethings, probably.

607
00:59:40,959 --> 00:59:55,599
There is the general background understanding of being, which every culture has, and which the unrepresentable, put that in there.

608
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:58,239
That's the carved on the body, but you can't read it.

609
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:04,880
The unrepresentable understanding of being is part of the saving background.

610
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:36,400
The particular sacred something or others that each culture has, and each culture can have sacred something or others because, they remember, that Mobidik and the ocean and the unrepresentable keep you from ever getting sort of this total control that Ahab was trying to get and leave you able to have local sources of meaning.

611
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,200
I'm trying to think whether there are two or three.

612
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:42,600
I think I go back to two.

613
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:46,999
I think the sacred and the holy, which is what heals you.

614
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:52,199
Remember, you've got to have more than these background practices because people have all something wrong with them.

615
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:57,079
They're cracked about the head, and you need something that saves you.

616
01:00:57,079 --> 01:01:04,840
Queque had it in his tradition, and everybody can have it in their tradition.

617
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:09,959
Well, except the poor people in the West and all the people they drag down with them.

618
01:01:09,959 --> 01:01:19,320
But the people that they haven't dragged down in all these other cultures that Ishmael visits like to have their temples and they're sacred.

619
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:23,640
And that's the sacred and the holy.

620
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,719
I don't know whether they're two or three.

621
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,320
I'll tell you why I'm puzzled about this.

622
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,320
And I'm going to come back to it next time.

623
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:38,920
I mean, remember all the kind of okay things that you get in the squeezing of the hand, the squeezing of the sperm passage.

624
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:46,920
The home, the bed, the wife, the table, horses, politics.

625
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:53,880
These are all things that give meaning to people's lives, give them a center, give them a focus, give them an orientation.

626
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,959
Are they all sacred?

627
01:01:55,959 --> 01:02:01,159
Or are they something else that's a supplement to them besides the sacred?

628
01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:15,159
How many things are left when the onto theological world collapses and takes everything that it has taken over down with it?

629
01:02:15,479 --> 01:02:18,040
And what's left that's saving?

630
01:02:18,039 --> 01:02:19,640
Well, the coffin.

631
01:02:19,639 --> 01:02:21,079
And that's one thing.

632
01:02:21,079 --> 01:02:22,600
That's the tradition.

633
01:02:22,599 --> 01:02:25,520
And that everyone has their tradition.

634
01:02:25,159 --> 01:02:29,599
And insofar as that hasn't gone down, that's saving.

635
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:33,840
It almost all went down, but luckily, at least the coffin didn't go down.

636
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:39,999
Now, here's the question: Are there two other things that are saving, or only one?

637
01:02:39,999 --> 01:02:49,520
I mean, that means: is there something called the sacred and something called the everyday kind of satisfactions?

638
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:53,600
Or are the everyday kind of satisfactions the sacred?

639
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:54,959
The healing?

640
01:02:55,519 --> 01:03:09,920
I think my hunch is that there are two kinds of healing: the special religious kind, which is extraordinary and outside of the everyday, and the everyday kind.

641
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:18,240
And Melville quote, slash Ishmael, is interested in saving both of them.

642
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,559
No, they're all sacred.

643
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:22,720
I found a passage that told me it.

644
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:25,200
Even the everyday is sacred.

645
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,560
And you know how we know?

646
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,040
Let's go back to the squeeze of the hand.

647
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:31,600
Anything that heals you is sacred.

648
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:40,159
And the everyday, when you get it right, heals you, as well as special religious ceremonies.

649
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:41,999
Help me find the squeeze of the hand.

650
01:03:41,999 --> 01:03:46,079
Chapter 42, page 402.

651
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,479
Here's why we think, why we say, okay, here we go.

652
01:03:51,360 --> 01:04:09,359
This is what's left besides the background, besides the ocean and Moby Dick, which is the unrepresentable in the traditions, carved on the bodies.

653
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:10,559
What else?

654
01:04:10,519 --> 01:04:11,320
This.

655
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:15,240
This other kind of attainable felicity.

656
01:04:15,559 --> 01:04:21,320
You should place your conceit of attainable felicity.

657
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:29,959
That is, where do you place your belief as to what is what makes life worth living?

658
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:33,640
What makes for happiness, contentedness.

659
01:04:33,639 --> 01:04:34,999
And here's a list.

660
01:04:34,999 --> 01:04:37,800
So you get the, see, I did it pretty well.

661
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,759
The wife, the heart, I take that to be friendship.

662
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:43,959
The bed, that's Aphrodite and erotic.

663
01:04:43,959 --> 01:04:52,599
The table, that's the food, dinners, the saddle.

664
01:04:52,599 --> 01:04:55,639
I don't know why the horse people get singled out, but they do.

665
01:04:55,639 --> 01:05:00,200
The fireside, we talked about that as the focus of the family once upon a time.

666
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:12,440
The country, that's the best example of that, where it was the Athenians at the end of the Orestea, when the pride in Athens was what gave their life meaning and direction.

667
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,360
Now, why do I think that's sacred?

668
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:16,119
Well, look what it says next.

669
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:20,040
I am ready to squeeze case eternally.

670
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:28,280
In thoughts of the visions of the night, I saw long rows of angels in paradise, each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti.

671
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:40,199
Well, that sounds like the ordinary, which is just what that list was, of which the squeezing of the sperm was a kind of example of friendship, at least.

672
01:05:40,599 --> 01:05:48,200
And all that ordinary is something that is brought together with the angels.

673
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:51,079
So it must be a kind of sacred.

674
01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:54,199
Then the everyday must be holy.

675
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,080
That is, it must be healing.

676
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:59,920
So he's got two proposals, I think.

677
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:17,999
This has not been so clear to me, not that it's all that clear now, but there seem to be two proposals here in Melville that you, well, one of them is this, I keep saying this Heidegger background thing.

678
01:06:17,999 --> 01:06:28,479
I mean, that's not what that's the you think you've got to appreciate the ocean, the whale, and all the unrepresentable where the book starts and so forth.

679
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:31,519
But I'm seeing besides that, what is there?

680
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:54,959
Well, there's looking at the sacred all over the world, which is what Ishmael does when he travels around, or settling down and making some local kind of good thing able to be your meaning-giving healing thing.

681
01:06:54,959 --> 01:06:57,280
I think he's got both of them.

682
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,479
And I think they both come under the sacred.

683
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:06,320
But there is, I gotta, but some of the sacred is sort of extraordinary, like the whale temple.

684
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:09,360
And like, I don't remember whether he ever talks about it in here or not.

685
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:11,039
I had this dim feeling that he does.

686
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:21,760
Sacred drugs, for instance, which he certainly would have thought was fine, eating the mushroom for the peyote ceremonies of the Native Americans and so forth.

687
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,159
That's a kind of extraordinary experience.

688
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:26,719
It's not something you do every once in a while.

689
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:35,679
There's all, religion is full of, in all these places, special things you do only under special conditions on special days.

690
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:38,400
And then there's these everyday things that you do.

691
01:07:38,719 --> 01:07:41,400
So there's something ordinary, this is how I want to put it.

692
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:44,679
There's something ordinary and something extraordinary.

693
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:46,919
And they both have healing power.

694
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:58,119
And they both will only flourish and heal if you get rid of the onto theological, which is keeping them into sort of second rate.

695
01:07:59,639 --> 01:08:21,079
And thinking that there's this Dante being the extreme, that there's this super Supreme Being which you can leave all that local stuff behind and get a real, immediate, total, mystical confrontation, which is completely fulfilling, completely eternal, and shows the meaning of everything.

696
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:26,919
That's the danger, because that doesn't really work.

697
01:08:26,919 --> 01:08:33,719
And it levels out what does work, just the way it levels out even Beatrice in the divine comedy.

698
01:08:33,719 --> 01:08:37,799
It levels out politics in the divine comedy, two of the on that list.

699
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:44,519
Either wife or I guess we'll call her wife, although it's not.

700
01:08:44,519 --> 01:08:52,440
But anyway, so I guess that's the final feeling you get.

701
01:08:52,759 --> 01:09:12,039
I'll just repeat it again, that it's an amazing disaster when Ahab, as the final monomaniac example of a kind of all forms of monotheism, brings down everything, almost everything, and almost everybody.

702
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:21,959
But it's not really a disaster because there are these two kinds of sacred left.

703
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:24,679
That's why I can't decide whether to count them as two or one.

704
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:28,799
There's two forms of sacred left.

705
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:47,599
The ordinary, meaning not the boring ordinary, not watching television and so forth, but the a fulfilling, a happy, fulfilling kind of ordinary, like having this good meal with your good friends and so forth.

706
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:49,679
That's fine.

707
01:09:49,679 --> 01:10:10,879
And the extraordinary, that is, where every what every religion has, which, like yo-yo for Kuique, is some special something which has which gives meaning to your life and orients you somehow tells you what is important.

708
01:10:10,879 --> 01:10:15,519
I just realized I didn't say one thing, and I have one minute, but I don't know what to say.

709
01:10:15,519 --> 01:10:17,679
That is moods.

710
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:19,759
What do I want to say about moods?

711
01:10:19,759 --> 01:10:21,440
Because moods are very important.

712
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:25,999
I'll come back to it next time, but I'm trying to sum it up in my head right now.

713
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:32,479
Moods are what attune you to what?

714
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,879
Not the tradition.

715
01:10:34,879 --> 01:10:37,839
That's global, but it's not a mood-like thing.

716
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:41,280
Not the ocean, not the background.

717
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:46,159
But moods attune you, I think, to everything else I've been talking about.

718
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:54,879
Each of those family, meal, horses, politics, you get attuned to them by way of moods.

719
01:10:54,879 --> 01:11:08,400
And the sacred, presumably, in its extraordinary, also with drugs and and and rituals and dancing and whatever its version is, is another something you get attuned to in moods.

720
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:14,999
So moods are going to turn out to be very important uh in period.

721
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,120
It's it's five.

722
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:23,079
I will go think more about it and Tuesday I'll try to be even, if I can, try to be more clear.

723
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:23,559
Okay.
