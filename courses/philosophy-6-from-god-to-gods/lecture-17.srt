00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,359
Then we're on to the divine comedy, and we skip a thousand years.

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,919
And I'm going to give you a really quick run-up to where we are.

3
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:27,039
There was Jesus, and then there, which, at the year zero, so to speak, where he changed the world so much that we count before and after him as the pagan world, the ancient world versus the Christian world.

4
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:35,439
And then there were the articulators, the Gospel of John, and the person I keep mentioning is Saint Augustine, who at about 300 A.D.

5
00:00:35,920 --> 00:01:23,399
tried to make sense of the Jesus story using the Gospel of John and all the other Gospels and the letters of Paul too, but particularly the Gospel of John, standing on his shoulders, tried to write a completely Platonic, that is, the philosopher Plato, account so that he said, well, what Plato called the good, which was this abstract, eternal, immutable something or other that gave everything its intelligibility and was very closely related to the logos, which is the word in John, that that was God and so forth, and tried to map everything onto the Platonic understanding.

6
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:37,000
But that didn't work very well because Plato thought, like also Virgil, that the body was a bad thing, and therefore, and the good was very abstract and didn't have a body.

7
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,439
But this was, but the sentence of the Jesus story is, after all, that the word became flesh, and Augustine couldn't make any sense out of that.

8
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:56,760
I heard lately, a student told me, to my amusement and happiness, when I was teaching the brothers Karamatsov, that Augustine is not a saint in the Greek Orthodox Church.

9
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,880
I'm all for that.

10
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,200
I think they're onto something there.

11
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:08,039
Augustine certainly didn't make it work, and things would have been in bad shape.

12
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:22,679
Where bad shape means they wouldn't have been able to find a language and a philosophy in which to state the meaning of all these weird sayings and parables and miracles and stuff that seems so hard to make sense of.

13
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:42,320
And then, in an old basement in North Africa, they found the lecture notes of some professor whose name happens to be Aristotle, and that brought about a whole revolution in people's thinking because Aristotle was sort of the Athenian anti-Plato.

14
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,399
He thought that bodies were important.

15
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:49,919
He thought the soul, in fact, was the form of the body.

16
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:57,039
He was just so anti-Platonist that he was a kind of materialist, which is sort of falling too far over on the other side.

17
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:06,320
But at least it was better to say that individual things and animals and people were more real than abstract ideas.

18
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,800
And starting with that and sort of running with it, St.

19
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,959
Thomas Aquinas, I'll write that on the board.

20
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,159
That's a new character in this that I mention occasionally.

21
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:16,719
St.

22
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:19,360
Thomas Aquinas, who people just call St.

23
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:26,559
Thomas, took on the big job of mapping all of Christianity onto Aristotle concepts.

24
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,200
And that became a big hit and just took over and eclipsed Augustine and the Platonists.

25
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:47,360
And by 1300, a thousand years after Augustine, Christianity got put into its, so to speak, final Catholic medieval form by St.

26
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:52,959
Thomas, mapping it onto Aristotle, and Dante lives at just that moment.

27
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:59,520
In fact, the time that the Divine Comedy takes place is 1300.

28
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:17,280
It doesn't really, Dante wrote it later than that, but the story, the adventure, or whatever you want to call it, that he's describing in the Divine Comedy, namely, his going to hell in purgatory and paradise, he dates as 1300.

29
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,279
That enables him to make predictions in the adventure he's telling, in this experience.

30
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,280
I see, I'm trying to find the right words for it.

31
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,040
People thought at the time that Dante had actually done this.

32
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:32,759
People pointed at him and said, that's the man who's been in hell, and so forth.

33
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:36,599
And I don't know whether Dante thought he'd actually done it or not.

34
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:38,280
It's not clear to me.

35
00:04:38,999 --> 00:04:45,640
So I'm just calling it Dante's adventure, whatever it is, that it's supposed to take place in 1300.

36
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:55,080
And that's at the time when Aristotle was considered the master of those who know, to quote the translation.

37
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:01,320
I mean, when every once in a while, Dante appeals to Aristotle to prove something.

38
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,080
As soon as you show that Aristotle said it, there's no more discussion.

39
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:16,119
Aristotle was the thinker who was right about everything, except that there were things about the revelation, like that Jesus was God, that Aristotle wouldn't be able to understand, or that the soul was immortal.

40
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:21,240
But generally, Aristotle, insofar as he tried to understand anything, he got it right.

41
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,599
And Dante has a little bit of a problem, which you just have to get used to.

42
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:27,719
You'll see it a lot.

43
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:32,040
Virgil knows Aristotle's work.

44
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,159
I suppose.

45
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,080
I never thought about that till this moment.

46
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,879
How would he?

47
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:57,320
Well, you'll see when we get to limbo that Virgil and Aristotle would certainly know each other and talk to each other a lot in the afterlife because all the wise pagans were together in a part of the, it's not the inferno because it's not heated up.

48
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,680
What would be the general name for it?

49
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:18,399
The no, there's the inferno, there's purgatory, there's the paradiso, but then there is limbo, which is a special thing outside of, maybe it's still part of the inferno, I guess, though it isn't heated up until you get a certain distance down.

50
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,599
We'll worry about that later.

51
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:23,360
The geography of all this is important to get straight, but not yet.

52
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:32,240
In limbo, which I'm going to talk about today, the virtuous pagans, that's where they are in their afterlife.

53
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:35,839
And Aristotle is there, and Plato, and Virgil, and so forth.

54
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:43,279
So Virgil, presumably, could know about and even know the doctrine of St.

55
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,680
Thomas Aquinas, and he does, because every once in a while he says to Dante, when Dante asks the question, well, if you read your St.

56
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,520
Thomas, you know that.

57
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:57,520
And then Virgil announces things that he could in this life never have known.

58
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,680
But although couldn't he have?

59
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,240
He could have.

60
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:05,200
He just, I mean, I guess he was around, but Virgil.

61
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,480
No, well, I don't know, Aristotle?

62
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:09,680
What?

63
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,639
No, couldn't have known Thomas, right?

64
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,039
He never quotes Thomas, I think, because Thomas isn't in limbo.

65
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,200
Thomas is in paradise once he dies.

66
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,000
He quotes, he, but I think Aristotle was completely forgotten.

67
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:34,640
These lecture notes that happened to survive in this musty basement and been there a long time, and Platonists sort of ruled the intellectual world, I believe.

68
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:37,760
These are things we'd have to sort out more.

69
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:43,440
The Aristotle got translated by Arabic scholars.

70
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,760
Veroaz is the main one.

71
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,080
And they get mentioned everywhere, occasionally.

72
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,160
I think that they're in limbo too.

73
00:07:50,719 --> 00:08:00,280
And once it gets translated from the Greek into Latin, and from Arabic into Latin, that's when it takes over.

74
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:03,400
Okay, now I'm going to just, then that's all background.

75
00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:07,480
And now, but I'll give you an example.

76
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:13,400
If you look at, hmm, maybe I haven't got it with me.

77
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:20,760
I wonder, I've written 86, page 868.

78
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,280
That doesn't make any sense.

79
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,320
So let's look and where would we find it?

80
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:33,560
We'd find it in the probably in Paolo and Francesca.

81
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,080
There's a place, I'll read you the quote, and then maybe we can find it later.

82
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:55,720
Dante asks, I mean, this is an example, an important example of how Aristotle gets into Christianity, and also an example that Virgil knows is Aristotle.

83
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,119
And here it is, only I don't know the page.

84
00:08:58,119 --> 00:09:06,520
Masters, I said, when the great clarion fades into the voice of thundering omniscience, what are those agonies, bodily agonies?

85
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,400
He's talking about the suffering of the people in hell.

86
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:14,520
Will they be the same or more or less after the final sentence, that is the day of judgment?

87
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,800
And he, to me, that's Virgil, to Dante.

88
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
Look to your science again.

89
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,959
Science is always Aristotle.

90
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:29,480
Where it is written, the more a thing is perfect, the more it feels of pleasure and of pain.

91
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:30,680
That's very interesting.

92
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,560
You finding it?

93
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,359
That would be great.

94
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:33,560
Where are you?

95
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:35,959
Anybody found it?

96
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:36,680
68.

97
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,240
Oh, I see why I had 868.

98
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:40,440
I knew that couldn't work.

99
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,279
68.

100
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,400
Oh, but that's wonderful.

101
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,360
You also answered an important question I forgot to ask.

102
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:47,200
Stop and immediately ask it.

103
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:51,040
All right, let's correlate our page numbers because remember what happened last time?

104
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,200
They weren't the same for the Aeneid.

105
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,640
They just like to cause you all to buy the book again.

106
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,080
So let's go.

107
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,039
Where does your Divine Comedy start?

108
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,119
Mine starts on page 28.

109
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,160
Yes?

110
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:05,999
27.

111
00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:07,119
Oh, maybe 27.

112
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:10,639
I can, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, well, yes, call it 27.

113
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,759
That's not Dante.

114
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,120
That's, by the way, you should know there's so many things I'm trying to say at once.

115
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:21,040
It's the translator who puts in these explanations at the beginning of the canto.

116
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:30,880
And I'm pretty sure, though I would love to have somebody find out who knows more about this, that it's the translator who puts in the headings for the particular.

117
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:37,520
I'll tell you why, because the heading for the first place where people are punished turns out to make no sense.

118
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,599
And therefore, I doubt if it's Dante's.

119
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:40,560
Now, there's only one question.

120
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:48,800
Surely Dante didn't write little excerpts at the beginning of each canto, nor, I think, did Dante give the cantos names.

121
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:59,200
I just don't know whether the names are traditional and have been around since 1300 when some other guy put them on, or whether each translator gets to put his own names.

122
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:06,160
But I'm pretty sure each translator gets his own names because I've looked in other translations and they can toes have different names.

123
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:09,999
Okay, I'm saying all that, but first I'm correlating pages.

124
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:11,680
I'm trying to do 10 things at once.

125
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,640
So 27, is that the answer?

126
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,239
That's where it says canto one.

127
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:18,080
Is that right for all of you?

128
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,360
Everybody?

129
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,399
Hooray.

130
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,680
Well, that makes life simpler.

131
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,000
Then let's go back to what I was reading until somebody, and now I found 68, that's very reassuring.

132
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:28,600
So let's go there.

133
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:29,479
So, okay.

134
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,080
Now, here, here we've got it.

135
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,720
And the guide to me at the bottom of 68.

136
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,799
No, no, not quite yet.

137
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,680
Yeah, the bottom of the very bottom of 68.

138
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:53,160
And he to me, look to your science where it is written: the more a thing is perfect, the more it feels of pleasure and of pain.

139
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,719
If you read carefully, what do you discover about the body?

140
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,320
He's talking about what will happen when these souls, so I have to explain that.

141
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,360
These people are all dead in hell, obviously.

142
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:14,360
And they must be sort of ghost-like, the way they are in Homer, and the way they are where they have to drink blood even to talk.

143
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,800
They're just exhausted.

144
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,000
And even in Virgil, where Aeneas, isn't it?

145
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:22,520
Aeneas tries to embrace his mother and his arms go right through.

146
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,480
Is that right?

147
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:24,600
I think so.

148
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:28,920
Or is that a little, or is it?

149
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,280
He tries to embrace his mother.

150
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:30,680
Okay.

151
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:37,159
How sort of diaphanous are the shades in the Aeneas?

152
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,439
Do we know?

153
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,679
Anybody?

154
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,239
Ah, I thought something like that.

155
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:43,879
Okay, good.

156
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:48,599
So these shades are still pretty insubstantial.

157
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:56,839
But bodies are so important in Christianity, and they get this already from the Hebrews.

158
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:00,599
Bodies are so important that the Hebrews don't have a problem.

159
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:02,679
When you're alive, you've got a body, and it's important.

160
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:04,919
And when you're dead, you're dead, and that's that.

161
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:13,040
But the Christians have what what's going on in the afterlife with these people whose bodies are in tombs someplace?

162
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,519
Well, they get sort of loner bodies.

163
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,479
And Virgil explains that at some point.

164
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:28,239
Bodies that feel pleasure and pain and are substantial enough so that they can hug each other, as Paolo and Francesca do in the reading for today.

165
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,760
And those, and now we can go ask.

166
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,519
Dante wants to know what's going to happen.

167
00:13:33,599 --> 00:13:45,599
And the Christians believe that on the day of judgment, all these bodies will come forth from the tombs and the people will get their bodies back.

168
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:49,040
That may cause a certain amount of problems, I think, probably in some cases.

169
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,879
But in general, and with a few miracles, that's what's supposed to happen.

170
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:55,519
Every soul gets its body back.

171
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,399
And now Dante's asking, and how about that?

172
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:18,399
When the day of judgment comes, this is a little on Phil in 58, each soul will come and hear the Edict of Eternity, and then that's when Virgil says, well, and Dante wants to know how will these punishments be after that.

173
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:39,039
And now you can really see the difference that's happened between the Platonist, Augustinian, anti-body people and the Aristotle people, because he says, look to your science, Virgil says, meaning Aristotle, where it is written, the more a thing is perfect, the more it feels pleasure and pain.

174
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,359
Now, what do you learn from that?

175
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:49,759
That getting a body makes you more perfect, which is a good thing to say if you've got a religion in which God has got become flesh.

176
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,320
And everybody gets back their flesh, and thereby they are more perfect.

177
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:03,639
And one of the things that happens if they're more perfect is that the ones who are suffering suffer even more, and the ones who are having are happy are happy even more.

178
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,000
And that's what he says.

179
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:13,080
All these souls, though they can never soar to true perfection, still in the new time, they will be nearer to it than they were before.

180
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,160
These souls means the ones in hell can never get true perfection.

181
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:20,760
That's because there's something wrong with them, or they wouldn't be in hell.

182
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,599
So when they get their bodies back, they're just going to be suffering more.

183
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:28,280
But their bodies, they will be more perfect.

184
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,080
Okay.

185
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:36,280
I say all that just to give you a sense of where things have gotten thanks to Aristotle and St.

186
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:40,999
Thomas and the funny way that Virgil knows where they've gotten.

187
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,159
Now let's see what else.

188
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:49,479
And I want to say just a word here before this.

189
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,959
Well, and what, I mean, I want to say one word: that St.

190
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:57,239
Thomas seems to me to lack something very important, though I've only read a few pages of St.

191
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,119
Thomas, and for all I know, it comes up somewhere.

192
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:07,800
There doesn't seem to be a place, a central place for love, but he couldn't ignore the commandment that you should love each other.

193
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,159
And Paul says the most important thing is adopting love.

194
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:11,639
What does St.

195
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:12,599
Thomas do about that?

196
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,159
I asked Dane because he knows about these things.

197
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,040
Well, he is.

198
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,919
And does he just have much to say about it?

199
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,359
Okay, well, good.

200
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:23,799
Then I'm wrong about.

201
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,320
I was going to say that St.

202
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:29,080
Thomas doesn't do much with the love part, but I'm glad he does.

203
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,640
But there's a certain kind of love that St.

204
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:43,519
Thomas knows nothing about, that Dante cares a lot about, and we'll hear a lot about in a little while, which is chivalric love, the love of the knight for his lady.

205
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:55,119
That's not obviously, it's maybe in there somewhere, but it's not what anybody saw in the Bible until much later.

206
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:56,800
But I'll get to that.

207
00:16:57,119 --> 00:17:02,159
I want to say one thing about the understanding of being, which somebody's bound to ask.

208
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:08,960
And it doesn't, again, it's not so clear what to say about it.

209
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:14,080
One thing is sure: that the understanding of being is now createdness.

210
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,920
That means we're all creatures, and animals are all creatures.

211
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,359
Everything's creatures because they're all created by God.

212
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:41,280
And that's, as I said in passing, that's the Roman idea of production carried from lots of people producing lots of things, like bricks, from bricks to empires, by imposing form on somewhat reluctant matter.

213
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:45,519
That's the whole Roman Aeneas picture.

214
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:57,519
Now you've got a super emperor kind of creator who actually produced everything and imposed all the order on it.

215
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,400
And what kind of, and how would that look?

216
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:03,439
What difference would it make if you thought about things that way?

217
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:14,960
Well, the difference it would be is that the world would be intelligible through and through because a good, intelligent, intelligible being had produced it.

218
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:22,639
And you see this clearly in Dante, where everything is intelligible down to the tiniest detail.

219
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,960
And it's all hierarchical.

220
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,320
That's the kind of intelligibility.

221
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,760
Everything is ranked so that the sins are all ranked.

222
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:32,440
No more sinners.

223
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:35,159
There, I don't know, I'd like to be fun to count them.

224
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:39,720
I would say at least 25 different kinds of sin, and they are clearly ranked.

225
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,679
As you go down in hell, they get worse and worse until you get to Satan, who's at the bottom.

226
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:50,759
Then you go up and up in paradise, and they get better and better until you get to the highest saints.

227
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,280
Even saints are ranked.

228
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,759
Not every saint, not all saints are equal.

229
00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:01,560
You go from sort of nuns to mystics with a lot of shades in between.

230
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,599
So the whole world is ranked.

231
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:12,520
Gold, for instance, is a higher, more, what would you say, worthy element than, say, iron.

232
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,639
That's ranked.

233
00:19:13,879 --> 00:19:23,320
When God created the world, it was just created intelligible and morally judged in terms of its value through and through.

234
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:30,280
And that understanding of being permeates everything Dante's doing.

235
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:39,960
Another thing is, I'm not listing what happens when you get a good God that produces all this, the supreme being creates it all.

236
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:44,359
Well, everybody gets what they deserve morally.

237
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:50,679
The bad people get suffering, and it's in proportion to how bad they are that their suffering is.

238
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:56,519
And the good people get bliss, and it's in proportion to how good they are, how much bliss they get.

239
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:02,040
So it's intelligible and morally structured through and through.

240
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,119
That's it for the understanding of being, as far as I can see it.

241
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:08,119
And, okay, so next thing.

242
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:08,680
We're ready.

243
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,040
Well, I'm going to stop for questions.

244
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,239
That's the background, as far as I'm concerned.

245
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,599
We're going to go on to Dante.

246
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:14,159
Yeah.

247
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,120
That's true.

248
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:15,599
That's true.

249
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:15,759
Good.

250
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,640
Beatrice says, gets rid of the distinction between nature and culture.

251
00:20:18,639 --> 00:20:19,439
That's right.

252
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:24,080
Because even nature is produced and intelligible.

253
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:32,720
And that's where we get the idea of the book of nature, where God has written everything, sort of morality into nature.

254
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,399
And so there are these books that tell you, sort of, rank the animals and how virtuous they are.

255
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,159
And they are virtuous in order to show us things.

256
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:50,959
I mean, the only one I know is another author, Foucault, who is always interested in the kind of Puritanism of Christianity.

257
00:20:51,439 --> 00:21:02,560
The elephant supposedly has sex a minimal amount of occasions or times or every few years or something, and then immediately goes and washes itself.

258
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,280
And that's a kind of the elephant is there to sort of illustrate something.

259
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,919
Everything is there to illustrate something.

260
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:15,919
And nature is to be read like a book and see what it illustrates.

261
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:23,040
And another example is the planets you will see are ranked because each planet corresponds to some virtue.

262
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:29,039
So Jupiter is a war planet and Venus is a love planet and so forth.

263
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:40,080
And the order of the planets as they are in heaven is again an example of the sort of value of the virtue that's associated with the planet.

264
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,280
So you can get this picture.

265
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:47,119
It is intelligible through and through in a way that the world never has been for any other culture.

266
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:51,439
And everything has grown into it to talk like Nietzsche.

267
00:21:51,439 --> 00:22:06,280
So that the whole of nature and culture and psychology and biology and astronomy is all one integrated hierarchical, intelligible whole created by this perfect God.

268
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:19,719
That's something so bizarre and amazing that we get used to it, but I'm sure it's unique in the history of the galaxy and maybe any galaxy.

269
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:28,919
So now we're ready to go to Dante's situation in this, unless there's any other questions.

270
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,159
Okay, to Dante.

271
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:34,120
So Dante is a Florentine.

272
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,000
That is, he lives in Florence, Italy.

273
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:50,439
He's the ultimate articulator, we'll see, of this medieval hierarchical Christian total mono vision.

274
00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:51,800
St.

275
00:22:51,879 --> 00:23:03,080
Thomas had already articulated it, but he articulated it in Latin, and it wasn't something that you could sort of hold it up for everybody to see and share.

276
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:09,719
Dante wrote it in the vernacular, that means in the vulgar language, that means in this case in Italian.

277
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:17,159
So it's a lot more lively, a lot more illustrations, and a lot more people can understand it.

278
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:26,200
But and in a way, that's Dante's role as articulator.

279
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:38,359
That makes his book seem to be, and makes it a work of art working if everybody thinks that he has held up to them this created world that they're in.

280
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:55,999
Now, somewhere I marked, okay, yes, on page 13, if you still have the same everything as I have, it's as if the author writing the introduction of this, whoever that is, has set it up just for us as a work of art working.

281
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,280
Here's what he says: on 13 is the introduction, right?

282
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,759
Anybody there?

283
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,639
13?

284
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,719
Okay, bring your books to class.

285
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,440
That's important.

286
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,959
Okay, I'm going to read from the introduction starting in line 4.

287
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:20,639
Before the author's death, that's Dante's death in 1321, for the first two parts, including the Inferno.

288
00:24:20,639 --> 00:24:22,080
Well, I can't begin in the middle.

289
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:28,879
Fame might indeed be said not to have awaited its completion, that is the divine comedy.

290
00:24:28,879 --> 00:24:46,479
Shortly before the author's death in 1321, for the first two parts, including the Inferno, were presented, including the Inferno, here presented, had already, in a few years, this is the important part, achieved a reputation tinged with supernatural awe.

291
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,399
This is what happens with works of art work.

292
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:53,599
Remember, the people also worshipped the Aeneid.

293
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:59,040
And so within two decades, a half dozen commentaries had been written.

294
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:03,760
50 years later, it was accorded the honor of public readings and exposition.

295
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,959
Remember, Aeschylus gets the honor of the Aristague being performed every year.

296
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:14,320
An almost unheard of tribute to a work written in the humble vernacular.

297
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:24,479
And it was finally, just as the Aeneid was given shrines, the divine comedy was declared divine.

298
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,279
Dante only called it the comedy.

299
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:38,599
About the middle of 13, Roman numeral 13, it was the atheist mid-16th century, which, in spite of certain reservations, first proclaimed divine the work of its author.

300
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,439
The work that its author had simply called comedy.

301
00:25:42,439 --> 00:25:52,119
Okay, so that's just to say, yes, but in Dante, Dante wrote a work of art and it worked.

302
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:53,720
That seems clear.

303
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,759
There was something more I wanted to say about it, just a second.

304
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,280
But I don't know, so I'll go on.

305
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:06,679
So that's what Dante wrote, but that wasn't what Dante thought he was doing.

306
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:11,479
He didn't say, I'm going to write a work of art that works.

307
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,080
I think Aeschylus did.

308
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:14,839
Homer certainly didn't.

309
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,959
But anyway, Dante had an entirely different job in mind.

310
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:37,800
He was influenced by the chivalric tradition, which was a certain offspring of Christianity, focused by the troubadours, and those are the poets who invented courtly love.

311
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:47,479
And Dante is right inside the courtly love, knights and ladies, chivalric way of looking at things.

312
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:58,040
And he is going to write a poem about his lady, Beatrice, a girl he's seen three times when he was 13 and she was 11.

313
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,440
I mean, it's as chivalric as you can get.

314
00:27:00,439 --> 00:27:03,879
You don't have to know the person that you set up as your lady.

315
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:08,439
You just have to organize your whole life around your devotion to her.

316
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,599
He had a wife and kids, but all he thought about and wrote about was Beatrice.

317
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:20,879
And he said he was going to write a poem about her such as no one had ever written about his lady before.

318
00:27:20,879 --> 00:27:23,359
And that's the divine comedy.

319
00:27:24,639 --> 00:27:34,800
What makes it a poem such that nobody has ever written one like it about their girlfriend before or after won't become obvious until next week.

320
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,000
It isn't obvious until the end of the purgatory.

321
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,119
But he did it, and it's pretty impressive.

322
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:58,719
And one more thing, I know, I remember now what I was about to say when I suddenly forgot, is namely, you might wonder, if I waited, maybe somebody would ask, is there any burning question on your mind about any of what I've been saying?

323
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,759
Yeah.

324
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,439
Or Beatrice?

325
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:02,800
Good question.

326
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,240
That isn't the question I thought you were going to ask, but I think it's an interesting one.

327
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,040
I have no idea.

328
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,560
Do anybody know?

329
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,599
He was still around, I suppose.

330
00:28:12,879 --> 00:28:15,040
That's like she died young.

331
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,560
She died in her 20s.

332
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,519
That's right.

333
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:28,480
So, okay, so she, so, no, and he, he, he, of course, she could still be around in paradise and appreciated.

334
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:41,999
I think, in fact, he did write it for Beatrice, even though she died, because he knows that Beatrice is in paradise, and he knows that Beatrice, and now we have to tell you a little bit more of the plot.

335
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:49,679
Beatrice is the one who has sent Virgil to guide Dante through all the realms of the afterlife.

336
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,639
So she's watching over him, so she must know that he's writing a poem about her.

337
00:28:54,639 --> 00:28:58,839
And that's how it looks to him, I think.

338
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,000
I thought somebody was going to ask, well, why is it called a comedy?

339
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,999
Why in the world did he write this book and say, the comedy?

340
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:08,679
Do you all know?

341
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:22,519
I mean, I wouldn't have known, but so somewhere in high school, I was made to memorize the little bit of definition that in a comedy, all conflicts are in the end reconciled.

342
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:34,360
Whereas in a tragedy, there is sort of everybody learns through suffering, and to suffering that the conflict that caused the suffering doesn't necessarily get fixed.

343
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:38,919
So this is a comedy because everything works out just as it should.

344
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:44,119
Again, it's a comedy because the bad people suffer and because the good people are in bliss.

345
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,560
That's now.

346
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:49,400
We're ready to go further, unless somebody has any question.

347
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,439
Okay, a little bit more you need to know about the geography of things.

348
00:29:52,440 --> 00:30:00,039
I think it's already in here, and I don't have to go into detail drawing it, but just in case.

349
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:07,639
The world at the time of Dante looks like that.

350
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:08,679
It's round.

351
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:10,039
Doesn't that surprise you?

352
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:19,319
In 1300, in 1492, we're told that Columbus was doing this big experiment to see if he went off, whether he'd fall off the edge of the earth.

353
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:24,439
Columbus may have been the only person who didn't know because everybody else seems to know it's round.

354
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,599
Dante certainly knows it's round.

355
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:35,240
And for a long time, they probably knew it was round, partly because they could see the masts of the ships coming up top first when they saw the ships on the horizon.

356
00:30:35,239 --> 00:30:38,599
Partly because they could see the shadow, I think, of the Earth on the moon.

357
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:57,599
In any case, it is Perdante round, and Florence is down here in Italy, and underneath Florence, with an entrance in Florence, is this big cone, empty space, and that's where all the inferno.

358
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:00,560
That's where all the bad guys are kept.

359
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:09,520
And when they did this, they seem to have had an awful lot extra dirt, so they built something here, which is purgatory.

360
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:30,400
And that's where the souls are who are purging themselves and who have had rather bad lives, but who want to be good, and they have a long time to suffer and pray, and eventually they get from purgatory up to there, up there, which is paradise.

361
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:46,480
And Dante's trip consists in going into Inferno here at Florence, going all the way down to the bottom where Satan is here at the bottom, and then crawling up this little path to the bottom of purgatory, and then climbing up purgatory.

362
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:53,200
That's just to keep your head while you're going through all the details.

363
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,959
And Jerusalem is here on this map.

364
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,879
The exits here when he gets up there.

365
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,080
So now let me see.

366
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:15,359
And around the Earth, I can't draw it up there, are lots of spheres, in which you'll hear more about when we get to the Paradiso.

367
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:23,840
There's the sphere of the moon, and then the sphere of Venus, and the sphere of whatever other planets they knew, I forget which ones.

368
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,599
And finally, in the final outer, outer sphere is heaven.

369
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:47,400
And in a very peculiar sort of science fiction way that Virgil manages to bring off, God, who is in heaven, isn't so is both everywhere at the final outermost sphere, but he's also the center of everything.

370
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:54,919
So there's a part of the trip where Dante sort of turns inside out the trip, which has been going further and further out.

371
00:32:54,920 --> 00:33:04,119
It becomes further and further in because it's got to finally get to the point where Dante gets to see God at the center of everything.

372
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:06,440
Now we've got enough of that, I think.

373
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,960
Let's see where we are.

374
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:11,960
Yeah, finally, we get to Dante's adventure.

375
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,599
And now we're on page 28.

376
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:16,200
And we stay inside.

377
00:33:16,199 --> 00:33:19,560
That was all background, which I think I had to give you.

378
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:24,759
But from now on, it's important that we stay inside this and read at least some of it.

379
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:29,879
By the way, the assignment for next time is on the syllabus.

380
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,000
Just keep your eye on the syllabus, which is in here.

381
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:40,280
And we are reading, well, wherever we get, we want to get by next time to the bottom.

382
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,879
But you don't have to read all of it.

383
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,000
Just read the cantos that I've listed there.

384
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,639
And that's all the ones I'm going to talk about.

385
00:33:48,199 --> 00:33:50,360
So now.

386
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,319
So Dante on page 28 now has lost his way in life.

387
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:05,799
He's depressed, confused, tempted by all kinds of bad things.

388
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:09,720
And that's it at the top of 28.

389
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,759
I'm sure it's beautiful in Italian.

390
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,239
It's famous.

391
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:20,160
Midway in our life's journey, I went astray from the straight road and woke to find myself alone in a dark wood.

392
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:26,400
And he was very frightened, and he didn't know how to get out of it.

393
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:32,879
And then he saw, he saw, where are we?

394
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:37,200
So by the end of the valley of evil, he sapped my heart with fear.

395
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,440
I found myself before a little hill.

396
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,480
I'm in the middle of 28 and lifted up my eyes.

397
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:48,639
His shoulders glowed already with the sweet rays of the planet whose virtue lends men strength on every road.

398
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:58,160
And the signing strengthened me against the fright whose agony had racked the lake of my heart through all the terrors of that piteous night.

399
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:03,199
And then just all the books that we read talk to each other, as you will notice, sort of.

400
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:04,480
You'll see more of that.

401
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,959
But Dante, of course, knows his Homer.

402
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,080
And what does he say next?

403
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:14,320
Just as a swimmer who with his last breath flounders ashore from perilous seas, does that sound familiar?

404
00:35:14,319 --> 00:35:16,639
You've heard that twice in the Odyssey.

405
00:35:17,759 --> 00:35:22,799
That's what happens when Odysseus comes out of the water and gets into the olive tree to sleep.

406
00:35:22,799 --> 00:35:28,400
And that's what happens again when he finally gets home into his own bed after all his adventures.

407
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,879
And now it's Virgil's taking it over.

408
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,880
I mean, Dante's taking it over.

409
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,400
And he is saved.

410
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:51,199
And we have to get to where he so swimmer and so-and-so might memorize the wide water of his death.

411
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:59,560
So did I turn my soul, still furtive from death surviving me, to stare down the path that none had ever left alive.

412
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:06,040
He's looking down toward the bottom of that of hell.

413
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:11,880
And then he sees we just jumped to 30.

414
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,800
Okay, at the top of 30.

415
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:17,639
And as I fell to my soul's ruin, fell into what?

416
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:18,840
Let's see.

417
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:23,160
He died from hope of ever climbing out of it.

418
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:29,240
And he was falling back into the sunless wood at the bottom of 29.

419
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:37,400
And as I fell to my soul's ruin, a presence gathered before me on the discolored air, the figure of one who seemed hoarse from long silence.

420
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,760
Who is that?

421
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:45,399
Somebody better say, because I get very discouraged if I don't believe that anybody is listening or doing the reading.

422
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,760
Who does he see?

423
00:36:46,759 --> 00:36:50,840
Virgil, hooray, yes, who is hoarse from long silence.

424
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:57,560
And well, he might be, because he's been silent for a thousand years since the time he wrote the Aeneid.

425
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:04,119
And he, when he talks about Virgil, well, Virgil says when he asks, Who are you?

426
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:07,719
Not man, though man I once was, and my blood was Lombard.

427
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:11,080
Both my parents met too, and these are all Italian references.

428
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:19,160
I was born, though late, sub Julio, and bred in Rome under Augustus in the noon of the false and lying gods.

429
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:20,520
Now that's interesting.

430
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:35,320
That means that Virgil has figured out that Christianity was right and that the Augustinian God was, as he sort of hints maybe in the Aeneid, an illusion, a false dream.

431
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:41,599
At least he now knows that this was the time of the false and lying gods.

432
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:47,280
And then, so Dante is 35 years old at this point.

433
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,639
The time is 1300.

434
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:55,280
And we now can skip ahead if.

435
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,960
And later, he's going to be the guide, he says.

436
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:07,200
And then at the bottom of 31, he's going to take him a certain place to the bottom of purgatory.

437
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:17,280
And then he says, to which, if it is still your wish to climb, that's the mountain now up there, if you wish to climb, a worthier spirit shall be sent to guide you.

438
00:38:17,279 --> 00:38:19,599
With her shall I leave you.

439
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,280
Who's that?

440
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,799
Beatrice.

441
00:38:22,799 --> 00:38:28,880
Yes, Beatrice is going to come and guide him, and Virgil's going to leave at a certain point.

442
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:35,760
And I leave you for the king of time who reigns on high forbids me to come there, and so forth.

443
00:38:35,759 --> 00:38:39,919
Now there's something I don't like in the next paragraph.

444
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:48,639
It's all very well that he thinks that God is a kind of emperor or a kind of king who reigns on high.

445
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:55,599
But there's something I can't understand, and it doesn't seem to be helped by looking at Italian, though I'm going to take one last look.

446
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,720
Virgil says, I rebelled against his law.

447
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:00,959
Virgil didn't rebel against anything.

448
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,119
He didn't know the law, and if he had, he wouldn't have rebelled against it.

449
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,999
I don't know what Dante is thinking.

450
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,319
Maybe he's just tired at that point.

451
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:14,799
Or maybe we can make the Italian mean something different than rebel.

452
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:18,080
Rebellion is a very serious thing.

453
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,000
It it's sin with a capital S.

454
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,679
It's turning against God.

455
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:29,800
Virgil couldn't have been doing that because Virgil isn't in the part of hell where the rebellions against God people go.

456
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,560
So I don't know what's going on.

457
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:38,359
The truth is, Virgil missed out on Christianity, but he didn't, but and that's true.

458
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:42,440
But it isn't as if there was Christianity around and Virgil knew it and he didn't like it.

459
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,359
So we have to just go on anyway.

460
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:52,920
Now, Beatrice is going to help him out eventually.

461
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,159
Beatrice sent Virgil.

462
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:58,680
I'm just getting you up to where we need to go into more details.

463
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:03,879
On 36, I was a soul among the souls of Limbo.

464
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:20,840
Limbo is this outer, outer edge of the inferno where the people who are not sinners because it was pre-Christian, the virtuous pagans are there, the virtuous Hebrews are there.

465
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:28,680
I was a soul among the souls of Limbo when a lady so blessed and so beautiful, I prayed her to order and command my will, called to me.

466
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:30,599
Her eyes were kindled with the lamps of heaven.

467
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:34,440
Her voice reached through me, tender, sweet, and low, an angel's voice, and so forth.

468
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,560
Of course, and she said at the top of 37, it's I, Beatrice, who sends you to him.

469
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,879
You see, go take pity on poor Dante.

470
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,920
He's lost.

471
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,279
And she says, I come from the closest heights for which I yearn.

472
00:40:46,279 --> 00:40:47,800
Love called me here.

473
00:40:47,799 --> 00:40:55,239
So that means she wants to get back to paradise as soon as she can, but she had to go get Virgil in Limbo first and send him off to Dante.

474
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:57,000
And that's what she did.

475
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,239
And okay.

476
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:06,119
Now, we're getting ready to start looking at the punishments in the Inferno.

477
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,240
All that was still, in a sense, background.

478
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:11,119
That was background inside the poem.

479
00:41:10,279 --> 00:41:12,480
First, I had to do background outside the poem.

480
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:22,639
But finally, we're getting to actual punishments, actual story about what goes on in the Inferno.

481
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:31,920
But before I do, I have to tell you there are two kinds of punishment in the Inferno: an interesting kind and a very boring kind.

482
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:48,240
That is, on page 41, Piarti, who understands very, very little of what's going on, although he's a good translator, gives you one of the kinds of punishments, the boring kind, in the middle of 41.

483
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:52,000
The law of Dante's hell is the law of symbolic retribution.

484
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,960
As they sin, so are they punished.

485
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:01,119
Now, that's called contra paso in Italian, I gather.

486
00:42:01,279 --> 00:42:06,000
I don't know where I've written it so I can spell it, but it's in effect, yeah.

487
00:42:07,279 --> 00:42:11,200
It says, as they did, we're going to turn it against them now.

488
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:16,080
How many know of the Gilbert and Sullivan opera, The Mikado?

489
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,199
Anybody?

490
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,760
I won't help to use that as an example.

491
00:42:19,759 --> 00:42:46,080
But there is an opera by Gilbert and Solomon, which is a perfect example of contra paso, where the emperor devised all kinds of very funny things that drive people crazy, who, when turned against them, the one I remember is the people who are totally obsessed with playing billiards are all given twisted, curved billiard cues for eternity.

492
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:50,880
They're trying to hit the ball, but they can't ever hit it straight, and so forth.

493
00:42:50,880 --> 00:43:00,520
Dante has sort of punishments like that, where it looks like you're turning the tables on the people.

494
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:05,639
Just to show you what it would look like, there's a punishment in here where we'll get to sometime.

495
00:43:05,799 --> 00:43:08,839
Maybe I think, in fact, you don't need to read it.

496
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:27,560
The schismatics, the people who split the church, are punished by being cleaved in half from top to bottom by devils with swords, and then they grow back together again, and then they're cut again because they cut the church in two, now they're being cut in two.

497
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,360
Very boring sort of punishment.

498
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:38,680
The interesting punishments are, and we'll look at them, the punishments where the punishment is the crime.

499
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:50,840
That is, you get a description of the life of the person who, while they were living it, wanted to live that way.

500
00:43:50,840 --> 00:44:02,280
But after they die, they see sort of the truth of how miserable they were, even though they hid that from themselves and sort of glamorized what they were doing.

501
00:44:02,279 --> 00:44:27,320
So the gluttons, for instance, in real, in life, thought they were gourmets and hated Chépanis, but in the end, they're sort of shown that they're more like pigs, that they are sort of wallowing in food and it's no fun at all, but it's supposed to be what they were doing all along, only they just didn't admit it to themselves.

502
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:31,719
So we've got to look at both kinds of punishment.

503
00:44:31,719 --> 00:44:36,519
Oh, by the way, the fortune tellers I wrote here, if I tell you the following, which is it?

504
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,159
The fortune tellers, is which kind of punishment?

505
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:50,160
The fortune tellers have their heads turned around so that they look behind them, and when they walk around, they bump into things because they used to see in front of them, now they can't see in front of themselves anymore.

506
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:51,119
What do you think about that?

507
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:55,040
Is that contrapaso or is that the punishment is the crime?

508
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,199
Right.

509
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:09,840
I mean, this is no, this doesn't give you any insight into a fortune teller's life than to see that they're being punished by not being able to see the future anymore and thereby constantly bumping into things.

510
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,000
That's just uninteresting.

511
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,839
So what would an interesting one be like?

512
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:18,480
Well, we're going to look at two interesting ones, I hope, before time is up today.

513
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:29,439
The second kind of punishment can be described in a way as the punishment in which they long for what they fear.

514
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,880
That is, where is it?

515
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,240
45.

516
00:45:35,279 --> 00:45:37,199
When he says, what about all these souls?

517
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:39,519
How did they get in hell at the bottom of 45?

518
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:49,040
They all pass over eagerly, for here divine justice transforms and spurs them so their dread turns wish they yearn for what they fear.

519
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,160
It's really more like they fear for what they're yearning for.

520
00:45:52,639 --> 00:46:13,360
It is that what they most desired, they are what they were addicted to, whether it was sex, you'll see, or love, no, sorry, not love, or food, or material things, whatever they were addicted to, they're still addicted to it, but now they see the dark side, the cost of that addiction, the misery that's really involved in it.

521
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,559
But they yearn for it and fear it.

522
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,880
That's the interesting kind of punishment.

523
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,639
So let's do two of them.

524
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:23,680
One of them, one of each to begin with.

525
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:26,000
Here's, and you can try to figure out which.

526
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:38,920
So now we're going to look at the people who Chiardi on page 41, showing utter lack of understanding, calls the opportunists.

527
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,919
They're not opportunists, you'll see.

528
00:46:41,319 --> 00:46:43,560
But we have to see what's happening.

529
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:53,639
They are people who have not taken sides on anything.

530
00:46:53,639 --> 00:47:01,880
They are, I want to translate them as the uncommitted, not as opportunists.

531
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:13,479
The clue is for on page 47, where you hear about one of these people, namely at the top, the footnote, the great denial.

532
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:15,720
Who made the great denial?

533
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:22,119
This is certainly intended to be Celestine V, who became Pope in 1294.

534
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:34,199
He was a man of saintly life, but allowed himself to be convicted by a priest named Benedetto, convinced by a priest named Benedetto that his soul was in danger since no man could live in the world without being damned.

535
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:39,080
In fear for his soul, he withdrew from all worldly affairs and renounced the papacy.

536
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,880
Does that sound like opportunism?

537
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,319
It does certainly not.

538
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:59,080
It sounds like somebody who should have had a commitment to do his job as pope, but put his own interests above that of a pope, and instead of tearing through on his commitment, sort of back out of his commitment.

539
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:10,440
And that's what these people are, I think, are people who don't stick to what they are committed to when it gets tough.

540
00:48:11,279 --> 00:48:27,680
And their punishment is that they are following all sorts of different banners, and the only reason, and changing, I think, from banner to banner, and only follow them because they're being stung to follow them by bees.

541
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,440
Now, is that a story about how their life really is?

542
00:48:35,759 --> 00:48:36,879
I don't think so.

543
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:58,560
I mean, that's again sort of if you were somebody who didn't follow any banner with any kind of enthusiasm, but simply look out for yourself as an non-committed person, then you get a kind of reversal, a contrapasto of life.

544
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:04,320
You are stung and forced into running after banners as if you were committed to them.

545
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,399
And something like that is going on.

546
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:12,960
It's pretty obscure, I must admit, but it's certainly not opportunism, whatever it is.

547
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:22,560
So that is a, I think, a kind of punishment that isn't like their life.

548
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:27,040
I don't think this Pope was running after various banners in his life.

549
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,399
He wasn't running after anything.

550
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,400
He was withdrawing from everything.

551
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:32,239
And so the punishment is the opposite.

552
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:35,200
He's now forced to run after all these banners.

553
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:41,520
Whereas, as it says on 47, he withdrew from worldly affairs and renounced the papistry.

554
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,240
And now, this is the punishment he gets.

555
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:50,560
And I think all I can say is it's a very peculiar kind of punishment.

556
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:56,680
And now, but I don't want to spend much time on it, except as a revelation of Dante.

557
00:49:56,679 --> 00:49:57,719
Now, why would this?

558
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:02,759
Not every punishment tells you a lot about Dante, but the two I'm going to talk about today do.

559
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,000
And this is the first one that does.

560
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:13,160
What's peculiar about this punishment, very peculiar, I'm reading the footnotes, and there are all kinds of facts that I wouldn't normally know.

561
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:20,520
There isn't any place in the normal Christian view of hell for the uncommitted.

562
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,920
Dante made it up.

563
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,359
And there isn't any place for it, literally, in the geography of hell.

564
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,199
So it's called the vestibule of hell.

565
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:33,800
It's sort of stuff on the outside of hell where these people are punished this way.

566
00:50:33,799 --> 00:50:35,560
Now, why is that interesting?

567
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:57,880
Because it tells you that Dante thinks it's such a serious crime to be uncommitted, to not take a stand and stick to it, that he's ready to go against in a kind of heretical way the story about hell and change the geography and build a space just to punish this kind of person.

568
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,959
And Dante, look at Dante, talk about uncommitted or committed.

569
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,360
He's utterly committed to Beatrice.

570
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:14,119
He's living his whole life in terms of Beatrice, or a lot of it, but you don't even know, and all the footnotes tell you in boring detail, and you should just glance at them.

571
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:17,320
He was also a very committed person in politics.

572
00:51:17,319 --> 00:51:27,160
He was taking sides between the two big political parties, the Guelphs and the Ghibellines, such that when the wrong party won, he was exiled from Florence altogether.

573
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:30,199
I mean, he was definitely someone.

574
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,800
Why didn't he just stay home and renounce his politics?

575
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,279
Because he thought that was the most awful thing in the world.

576
00:51:36,279 --> 00:51:42,720
You should take a stand on love and a stand on politics, and you should stick to them.

577
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:50,480
So he expresses his outrage at these people who are not opportunists but uncommitted.

578
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,280
And that's interesting about him.

579
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,680
And it's a kind of, well, that's it.

580
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:02,560
Now comes the interesting one, because it's the right kind of punishment.

581
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,520
And that is limbo.

582
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,920
Limbo is in the tradition.

583
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:13,279
Limbo is in the tradition way back to Homer, where it was the fields of Aspodel.

584
00:52:13,279 --> 00:52:34,639
Remember where Menelaus was going to go, where life, or in this case, death, was a dream of ease, and everybody who was sort of laid back and had nice, comfortable life and had parties and talked to other people and so forth, nice sociable lives.

585
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,200
They could go on like that forever.

586
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:40,720
Well, that's where the virtuous pagans are.

587
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:48,560
Limbo is a nice area where nice people gather and talk and so forth.

588
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:54,000
You can see, and this is on the bottom of 50, two-thirds of the way down.

589
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:02,240
No tortured wailing rose to greet us here, but sounds of sighing rose from every side, sending a tremor through the timeless air.

590
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:06,239
A grief breathed out of untormented sadness.

591
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,400
Who does that remind you of?

592
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:13,520
Who was sort of seen to write a poem full of sadness?

593
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:14,799
Well, Virgil.

594
00:53:14,799 --> 00:53:19,920
People thought, remember, that people were so sad that they didn't even want to be born.

595
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,560
It was better never to be born.

596
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:28,679
And what could be better than being dead is the moral of the sentence of the Aeneid.

597
00:53:29,799 --> 00:53:34,359
So they are, like Virgil, sad.

598
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,560
There's nothing joyful.

599
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:47,160
There's nothing blissful, ecstatic, fulfilling, meaningful for them, but they lead calm lives.

600
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:56,599
And so naturally, you're going to find Virgil at home in Limbo, because that's where he normally is.

601
00:53:56,599 --> 00:54:00,439
And so he's going to, because all of the other virtuous pagans.

602
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:10,280
And Dante asks, and the master said to me, sorry, he says, you do not question what souls these are that suffer here before you.

603
00:54:10,279 --> 00:54:15,560
I wish you to know before you travel on that these were sinless to the bottom of 50.

604
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:20,039
That's how we know that Virgil isn't a rebellion against anything, that these were sinless.

605
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:31,080
And still their merits fail, for they lack baptism's grace, they weren't Christians, which is the door to the true faith you were born to.

606
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:38,280
Their birth fell before the age of the Christian mysteries, and so they did not worship God's Trinity in false duty.

607
00:54:38,279 --> 00:54:39,639
I'm one of these.

608
00:54:39,639 --> 00:54:51,560
For such defects are we lost, though spared the fire and suffering of hell in one affliction only, that without hope we live on in desire.

609
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,680
That is, they don't know what they're missing.

610
00:54:54,679 --> 00:54:58,280
They just have, they're just sad and they wish they were dead.

611
00:54:58,279 --> 00:55:01,800
If they knew what they were missing, they'd already be a step in the right direction.

612
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:06,680
But as it is, they, without hope, in fact, that seems wrong.

613
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:08,119
Gotta look at the Italian there.

614
00:55:08,279 --> 00:55:10,560
Shouldn't be without hope they live in desire.

615
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,559
They don't even desire.

616
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,999
They're just sad.

617
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:17,680
Who, without hope, lives in desire?

618
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:20,000
Who would?

619
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:28,639
I'm thinking the Hebrews, waiting for the Messiah, lived in desire, but they had hope for the Messiah.

620
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:36,639
These ones, the virtuous pagans, had no hope and no desire, it seems to me.

621
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:43,840
I don't know whether that's what's going on there, but what Virgil, they're missing something.

622
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:49,840
Whether you call it desire when you feel that you're missing something, but you don't know what, I wouldn't call that desire.

623
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,520
The sadness is better.

624
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,440
But anyway, they are in limbo.

625
00:55:53,440 --> 00:56:00,800
So he says, I thought how many worthy souls there were suspended in that limbo and so forth.

626
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:03,840
And now, let me see.

627
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:13,439
So now they'll never be able to have a fulfilled and blissful, joyful life because they never even wanted one.

628
00:56:13,759 --> 00:56:18,800
And the afterlife is just a continuation of this life, like it was for Menelaus.

629
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:21,760
They get the life exactly that they wanted.

630
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:31,520
The life in which they walk around and talk to each other and sigh and discuss, and presumably that's fine.

631
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,480
There's no commitment, there's no risk, there's no bliss.

632
00:56:37,759 --> 00:56:44,000
And all human beings need total fulfillment, joy, bliss.

633
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:51,920
That's what they were made to have, to be able to contemplate something that's totally meaningful and fulfilling and satisfying.

634
00:56:52,799 --> 00:57:02,680
Whether it's Beatrice for Dante or whether it's God for the contemplatives or whatever, they don't have it and they'll never have it.

635
00:57:02,679 --> 00:57:07,080
And human beings were meant to have it, so they were in a sad state.

636
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,720
Now the question is: I wonder if anybody has a question.

637
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:16,840
So there they are, condemned for eternity, and what is their crime?

638
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,560
They happen to live before Jesus.

639
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,400
That doesn't seem fair, yeah.

640
00:57:21,719 --> 00:57:22,759
Ah, good.

641
00:57:22,759 --> 00:57:34,520
Well, that's because you don't get to purgatory unless you're the kind of person who is living your life trying to get over whatever sin you've got.

642
00:57:34,759 --> 00:57:52,279
They are the people in purgatory are sort of the kind of people who would be recovering alcoholics, for instance, who have got into the grip of some sin, who have to struggle to get out of it.

643
00:57:52,279 --> 00:57:53,879
And that doesn't fix the speaker.

644
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,560
You can't put them into purgatory.

645
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:59,159
All you can do is put them into where they were, and that's where they were.

646
00:57:59,159 --> 00:58:01,879
They get exactly what they want.

647
00:58:02,199 --> 00:58:03,319
Well, want isn't right.

648
00:58:03,319 --> 00:58:13,080
Yes, I guess what they want, because they want to be left alone, they want to be calm, they want to be without any risk and so forth.

649
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,080
And that's what they want.

650
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:18,200
And they got it.

651
00:58:18,199 --> 00:58:24,039
In fact, one way to put it is as Stoics, they want moderation, self-control.

652
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:32,760
We had a word the other day discussing what kind of thing they had, that poets had, according to Dante.

653
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,239
But that's enough to do.

654
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:45,840
So they didn't get in the right relation to the possibility of agape love and fulfillment that Jesus brought.

655
00:58:40,759 --> 00:58:48,000
And now we're back to your question.

656
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:53,839
But the punishment isn't unfair because they had no such choice.

657
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,039
There was no revelation.

658
00:58:55,679 --> 00:59:07,599
There was nothing that told them that there was a better thing that human beings needed and could get than human beings than they desired and couldn't get.

659
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,319
They had no choice because there was no revelation.

660
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:15,280
And the question is, is that fair?

661
00:59:15,279 --> 00:59:17,759
And the answer is it's not a question of fair.

662
00:59:17,759 --> 00:59:19,599
That's why you've got to see this.

663
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:23,599
The afterlife isn't a kind of arbitrary punishment.

664
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:26,479
That's why that contrapasto looks is so confusing.

665
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:34,240
The afterlife is just the life you lived, now given its eternal significance and stuff forever.

666
00:59:34,239 --> 00:59:36,000
It's like Menelaus.

667
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:47,119
And it's that Menelaus people aren't, as I just realized, breathing sadness into the air because they lived active, happy lives.

668
00:59:47,759 --> 00:59:51,919
And even, well, now I be careful.

669
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:55,280
Achilles is an active one and he's unhappy.

670
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:58,159
Menelaus, I don't know.

671
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,159
Let's not worry about it.

672
01:00:00,159 --> 01:00:00,720
Yeah.

673
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,720
Yeah, we've got to get to that.

674
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,239
I'm going to get to that in a minute.

675
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:13,679
Okay, anyway, they never wanted out of it, and they are simply living the lives they lead, all of them.

676
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:17,359
I mean, the crazy punishments sort of mess it up.

677
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:21,280
But you'll see another one next time, that is, maybe even this time.

678
01:00:21,279 --> 01:00:22,719
But let's go on with them.

679
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,119
So they didn't know about love.

680
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:31,559
They were happy to be safe and sad and do their duty.

681
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:38,599
And their love, they didn't have any love and so forth.

682
01:00:38,599 --> 01:00:40,040
So, and there they are.

683
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:43,000
I mean, you can't ask sort of, was it fair?

684
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:50,440
You could ask maybe sort of, well, it's too bad for them that Jesus came so late and that there's so many people in the world that he didn't get in touch with.

685
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:56,119
Well, that's true, but that doesn't, and maybe you could blame the Creator for that.

686
01:00:56,119 --> 01:01:01,720
But once Jesus comes at the time he comes, and there's no answer to why he comes when he does.

687
01:01:01,719 --> 01:01:06,199
He comes in the, quote, in the fullness of time, according to John.

688
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:14,119
And once he does, then everybody who isn't in touch with him won't just be in limbo.

689
01:01:14,119 --> 01:01:17,800
They'll have some other story, which we haven't got to yet.

690
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:19,719
But we have to get to what Dietrich said.

691
01:01:19,719 --> 01:01:23,880
What about Jesus coming down and taking a bunch of people out of limbo?

692
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:27,080
Who did Jesus take out of limbo, do you imagine?

693
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:33,399
I take it, let me put it as a puzzle, that for Dante, who solved it.

694
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,520
I don't know whether the Christians already solved it or he made it up.

695
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:37,479
There's a puzzle.

696
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:43,000
If you say these people got what they wanted, then nothing you can do to fix that.

697
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,919
That's the eternal meaning of their life.

698
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:48,440
Jesus can't come and retroactively give them joy.

699
01:01:48,440 --> 01:02:02,679
But there are people who wanted something, namely total happiness and joy, but unfortunately they lived in the wrong place at the wrong time and didn't get it, though they understood that it would happen sometime.

700
01:02:02,679 --> 01:02:04,599
It didn't happen while they were around.

701
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:05,880
Who were those people?

702
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:09,240
The Jews, the Hebrews, exactly the Messiah.

703
01:02:09,239 --> 01:02:13,520
They understood that the glory of God would finally come.

704
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,800
And then, so what does Dante have to do about them?

705
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:22,080
Going to leave them in limbo?

706
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,360
No.

707
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:31,920
Then Jesus has to go down and get them and expose them to his truth and take them all out.

708
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,080
He took the Hebrews out.

709
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,720
And you get this on 51.

710
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:39,280
He takes out all these biblical figures.

711
01:02:39,279 --> 01:02:46,399
So the mighty one, the middle, descended here among us, crowned with the sign of his victorious years.

712
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:53,919
I wonder whether I think there's a sort of joke in here, but I'm not sure.

713
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:59,679
Did Virgil mistake the crown of thorns for a kind of laurel wreath when Jesus came down there?

714
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:01,840
That's what I think is happening.

715
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:23,760
Here, this person, this mighty one, came down with a sign, namely something on his head, crowned with something, and he took from us the shades of our first parent, of Abel, his son, of Noah, of Moses, the bringer of law, the obedient, Abraham, David, his father, and so forth, Rachel, and so forth and so forth.

716
01:03:23,759 --> 01:03:26,639
And do you want to say, why those only?

717
01:03:26,639 --> 01:03:28,960
And then Dante says, and many more.

718
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:34,720
I think that means all the Hebrews, all the Hebrews who weren't sinners in some respect.

719
01:03:34,719 --> 01:03:50,639
All the virtuous pagans are stuck in limbo, and all the virtuous Hebrews are taken up and exposed to Jesus and thereby got the joy and the bliss and the Messiah effect that they were wanting.

720
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,559
That's how it looks to Dante.

721
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:55,920
And the all, let's see, where are we?

722
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:08,279
Okay, yes, he visits, he takes out the figures, the other, all the Hebrews, and leaves behind the virtuous pagans, which include the philosophers on 53.

723
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:15,479
Well, it's funny, of course, they didn't have a clear distinction between literature and reality.

724
01:04:15,479 --> 01:04:27,719
He leaves behind, I mean, he takes, yeah, he leaves behind near the bottom of 53, Electra, Hector, Aeneas, Caesar, all these sort of mythical and historical figures mixed together.

725
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:50,759
And at the bottom of 55, Dante sees on high, that is on limbo, in limbo, on a hill, Aristotle, the master of those who know, ringed by the great souls of philosophy, Plato at his side, it's on top of 54, before all others, before all others except Aristotle, and then a whole lot of other ones.

726
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:58,359
And then remember, I couldn't spell it, so I didn't write it on the board, but thank goodness there it is on 54, the people who translated Aristotle.

727
01:04:58,359 --> 01:05:09,639
So besides Euclid, Ptolemy, Hippocrates, there is Avancena and Averroes, the Arab translators of Aristotle.

728
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,159
Those are all there.

729
01:05:11,479 --> 01:05:16,119
That is both the Greek and the Arab philosophers.

730
01:05:16,119 --> 01:05:21,719
And now, just the last interesting punchline, really, and who else?

731
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:29,239
Well, the great poets, and particularly the very, very great poets who wrote works of art that worked.

732
01:05:29,239 --> 01:05:32,799
So you get that on 52.

733
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,839
And the middle of the page.

734
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:40,119
There's an honor, about five stanzas on 52.

735
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:47,199
And as he spoke, a voice rang on the air: Honor the Prince of Poets, the soul and glory they went from us.

736
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:50,880
The soul and glory that went from us returns.

737
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,960
Here he is, here he is, the crises.

738
01:05:53,279 --> 01:06:00,159
I saw four mighty presences coming toward us and neither joy nor sorrow in their bearing naturally.

739
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:01,519
And who was that?

740
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:08,559
Well, if you skip down to the very bottom, and after they had talked a while, no, let me see, where's Homer in there?

741
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,880
I'm sure Homer is there, just a second.

742
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,920
Oh, yeah, I just didn't see it.

743
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,639
It is Homer, singing master of the world.

744
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,800
Next to him, Horace, and so forth and so on.

745
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,199
So Homer is the great poet.

746
01:06:21,199 --> 01:06:23,119
He's the first reconfigurer.

747
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:27,439
He's certainly the one that Dante most admires.

748
01:06:27,439 --> 01:06:33,199
And then, and now comes Dante, which does an amazing move.

749
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:41,599
You can think about sort of yourself whether this is incredible pride or what, that he says at the bottom.

750
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:50,080
And after they had talked together a while, they turned and welcomed me most graciously, at which I saw my approving master smile.

751
01:06:50,080 --> 01:07:00,479
So Dante writes a poem in which the great poets of all time, including Homer who made a work of art work, says, You're one of us.

752
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:07,439
And they honored me far beyond courtesy, for they included me in their own number, making me six in that high company.

753
01:07:07,439 --> 01:07:09,199
Well, what do you make of that?

754
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:14,759
Well, on the one hand, you could say amazing self-confidence and self-promotion.

755
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:17,119
Or you could just say, well, he was realistic.

756
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:22,080
He knew that he was writing a work that was going to be at the level of the greatest possible poets.

757
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:25,960
That Homer would say, he had a good job, Dante.

758
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:28,439
And he congratulated himself.

759
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:29,479
And he was right.

760
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:37,319
You can't be very annoyed at him for having put himself among the greatest poets of all time, since he was one of the greatest poets of all time.

761
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:39,000
And he somehow knew it.

762
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,920
Anyway, that we can stop with that.

763
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:48,439
Dante's now congratulated himself and he starts down into the inferno.

764
01:07:48,439 --> 01:08:00,040
Be sure and read two things I want you to read: the part on Powell and Francesca, and let me just tell you, because it's very, I'm going to read it very carefully.

765
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:04,119
I don't know where it is, but I've got to find it.

766
01:08:04,119 --> 01:08:09,239
You can start packing up, but I'll tell you where what I want to read is.

767
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:14,279
Where is Tanto V toward the end?

768
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:17,239
Now that's Paula and Francesca.

769
01:08:17,239 --> 01:08:19,319
Definitely read that one.

770
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:24,920
But then I want to talk about what happens outside the city of Dith also next time.

771
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,679
It's very, okay, here we are.

772
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:29,159
So, and Tanto 8.

773
01:08:29,479 --> 01:08:33,719
Whatever else you read, more, because there's more in the assignment.

774
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:37,799
Definitely Tanto V and Tanto VII for next time.

775
01:08:38,119 --> 01:08:38,679
Okay.
