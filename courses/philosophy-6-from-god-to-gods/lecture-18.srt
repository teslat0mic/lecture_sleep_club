1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
Two big subjects for today.

2
00:00:01,921 --> 00:00:07,360
Both of them very interesting, as interesting as anything in the book, but there's so much interesting in this book.

3
00:00:07,601 --> 00:00:18,081
But anyway, the one is his Dante's reaction to the incontinence, as the chapter is called, as the canto is called.

4
00:00:18,081 --> 00:00:21,280
I don't think that's the right name for it, that that's all right.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,600
We will rename it when the time comes.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,280
And I explain why it shouldn't be called that.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,440
But it's called, oh, it's called the Carnal.

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,120
Why did I get the idea?

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,040
It's the incontinent.

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,440
I don't know.

11
00:00:35,441 --> 00:00:37,120
That's not my name for it.

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,120
It's not, and it's not Charlie's name for it.

13
00:00:39,441 --> 00:00:44,601
Anyway, it's Canto 5 that we're going to be reading.

14
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:52,440
And I think we'll see that Virgil calls it incontinent, and Chardi, the translator, calls it carnal.

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:01:09,000
I want to call it the committed, but these are the people who are, so to speak, the opposite of the uncommitted outside of hell who don't get sort of committed to anything.

16
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:22,041
The people in this level of hell are totally committed to something, something which is not going to give them a joyful life if they get committed to it.

17
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:27,880
I mean, you can be committed to, say, smoking with all your might, but that doesn't mean that you're going to have a good life.

18
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:43,720
But so Dante's interested in these people because he admires them as committed, and he somewhat identifies with them in the kind of commitment they've got, but he also knows that it's got something wrong with it.

19
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,840
And that's all going to turn out to be very interesting.

20
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:56,280
Why I call them incontinent is, and why Virgil calls them incontinent, is that literally means incontinence, you've lost control.

21
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,880
And these people have lost control of their lives.

22
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:28,480
And this is a very good example of the kind of punishment that is the good kind, not the contrapaso, where you did something and now something nasty is going to happen to you, but where what happens to you in hell is what happens already through in your life, which what you couldn't give up even if you wanted to, and what's revealed in hell is the dark side of it, and that's what you're stuck with for eternity.

23
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:31,681
But I think I mentioned before, but if I didn't, I want to say it now.

24
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:41,361
When Dante says that when these souls are ferried over to hell, I don't want to try to look it up right now, their fear turns to desire.

25
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,640
Did I mention that?

26
00:02:42,641 --> 00:02:46,481
Oh, I wish I could open my book to it, but I don't want to spend the time.

27
00:02:46,481 --> 00:03:00,401
But anyway, what that means, what I would take that to mean is that they both fear the consequences of this kind of commitment that they've got, but they wouldn't give it up.

28
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:13,760
It's like telling somebody who's a smoker that if they go on smoking, they'll get emphysema, but the next hour or so, when they're ready to smoke, their fear of emphysema is trumped by their desire to smoke.

29
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,880
So these people, even though they know the dark side, can't give up the desire.

30
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:33,601
And now we'll, and they turn out to be not smokers in Dante's time, but in the circle we're going to look at, the carnal, according to Darty, these are sex and love addicts.

31
00:03:33,921 --> 00:03:36,160
And some are just sex addicts.

32
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:38,640
I don't think any of them are just love addicts.

33
00:03:38,641 --> 00:03:45,361
And then there are gluttons and people hooked on material things.

34
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:47,601
And oddly, the angry.

35
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:52,561
I spent a long time trying to figure out what it is that the angry love and desire.

36
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:59,841
I mean, the love addicts love people, and the gluttons love food, and the materialists love things like BMWs.

37
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,561
But what do the angry love?

38
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,481
Well, all you can say is it's sort of, it's almost like a pun.

39
00:04:06,481 --> 00:04:09,280
Well, what they loved was getting angry.

40
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:11,721
They loved hating people.

41
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:16,841
That's the only way to understand their kind of addiction.

42
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:27,560
There are people who just are sort of can't control the fact that they are always in a state of outrage, and those are the ones in the angry.

43
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:46,280
Now, we're only going to talk about the ones in the circle of the lovers, because those are the most interesting to Dante, and their relation of their, I don't even want to call it crime, the relation of their addiction to their punishment is the most interesting.

44
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:50,601
All these people love the wrong things.

45
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:57,801
Other people's bodies, food, material things, and getting angry.

46
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,361
Those are all the wrong things.

47
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:01,801
And what's wrong with them?

48
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,880
That's where it begins to be interesting.

49
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,320
It's not a kind of puritanical rejection of them.

50
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:20,200
It's the only thing wrong with loving one person with all your might is it is not fulfilling and it has certain painful consequences.

51
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,921
And the same for food and the same for material things.

52
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:29,801
These are all people who loved something too much, more than it could satisfy them.

53
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,241
One more thing, Papers.

54
00:05:31,401 --> 00:05:34,601
And you've got to resist this puritanical tendency.

55
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:40,361
It's fun to have Chiardi in here just to see how sort of hopeless our culture has become.

56
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:41,801
And a Catholic he is, too.

57
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:52,601
I mean, it sounds like Puritan Protestantism to think that somehow loving bodies and sex too much is so terrible.

58
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:58,880
In fact, you've got to realize that for Dante, it is the least serious sin there can be.

59
00:05:54,521 --> 00:06:18,080
Because up to now, all we've seen is the people that aren't really counted as sinners because Dante made up the category, namely the uncommitted, and then the people in Limbo who aren't sinners because they couldn't help it, what they did, but they've got lives where they have no relation to Jesus or God.

60
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:28,160
And now we've got the first of the sinners who, that is, knew about Christianity, were Christians, and loved something too much.

61
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:34,400
But it's the sin for which Dante has the most sympathy.

62
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:38,160
It's practically admiration he has for them, as you'll see.

63
00:06:38,161 --> 00:06:48,560
And that's because what they love is the most fulfilling thing short of the fulfilling something that you could love.

64
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:55,120
We haven't really talked about what that would be yet, but we won't for a while.

65
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:16,001
But it's obviously, I mean, in some version or other, it's got to be what Jesus was telling the apostles to love, to love each other and to love him in some way which is different than what the lovers in this canto have to each other.

66
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,521
The lovers in this canto are examples of romantic love.

67
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:37,440
They are a kind of total commitment for another individual, or sort of mixed in with them, is also people who were just totally committed to sex and made phallic idols and so forth.

68
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,041
This woman we'll hear about.

69
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:48,921
And you have to sort of look up in the footnotes the various people who are in one of these stages of the inferno to try to figure out what the unifying feature is.

70
00:07:48,921 --> 00:07:58,360
And I'm sort of reading into it my version of the unifying feature: uncommitted addicts for sex and/or romantic love.

71
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,041
That's what that covers them all, and only then.

72
00:08:02,921 --> 00:08:04,041
Now, Viakas.

73
00:08:04,281 --> 00:08:05,320
Oh, great.

74
00:08:05,641 --> 00:08:06,521
Let's hear it.

75
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:08,361
Yes, okay.

76
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:10,041
This is what I'm trying to explain.

77
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,601
I want to get my pen so I can write it in.

78
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:36,840
But what I'm trying to explain, okay, what I want to explain is what is it, I'm trying all the time, we should be thinking all the time about what it means to say that as these souls approach the inferno, which is full of all kinds of unpleasant things, to say the least, they nonetheless desire it.

79
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,921
That's what I was trying to explain.

80
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:44,041
It's all passed over eagerly from here.

81
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:51,560
Divine justice transforms and spurs them so that their dread turns wish, they yearn for what they fear.

82
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,161
That just continues.

83
00:08:53,161 --> 00:08:55,961
You can think of smokers and emphysema if you want.

84
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,721
That's part of divine justice.

85
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,001
It's just built into the way nature works.

86
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:22,681
That if you love the kind of things that are in this first four stages, again, love beautiful bodies or food and good food, I mean, gourmet food, even, and beautiful material things, and getting angry, this funny category, which, by the way, sort of fits Dante.

87
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:25,520
He's angry about an awful lot of things by the end of the book.

88
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:34,881
I mean, he's angry about politics, he's angry about popes, he puts the current Pope in hell already and says there's only a kind of ghost of the Pope actually on the throne.

89
00:09:35,681 --> 00:09:39,441
So he knows that anger is a big, big temptation.

90
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,601
Okay, where are we now?

91
00:09:42,881 --> 00:09:56,081
So they're seeing what they find attractive in their life now unglamorized and unattractive, but still irresistible.

92
00:09:56,801 --> 00:10:04,560
They haven't got any of the illusions anymore and the rationalizations and the social support that covered up the downside.

93
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:13,761
The way being a glutton looks like being a gourmet when you're eating in a nice restaurant with people you like and so forth.

94
00:10:13,761 --> 00:10:19,281
But that covers up the fact that if that's the most satisfying thing in your life, you're in trouble.

95
00:10:19,281 --> 00:10:32,080
And if it's if it's, I had a neighbor, that's what I'm talking about, he had a white BMW convertible, and every weekend he cleaned and polished and shined and washed this beautiful white convertible.

96
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:39,841
And Dante would have felt sorry for him and said he'd be better off if he had gone to Che Panis or even better off if he had a girlfriend.

97
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:47,441
But there are all these levels of getting addicted to things that aren't really satisfying.

98
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:50,080
So now what else here?

99
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,720
Let's see.

100
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,521
And the sins, of course, get worse as you go down.

101
00:10:53,521 --> 00:10:59,601
That's what I was just saying when I said, you've got to realize that sort of structurally.

102
00:10:59,601 --> 00:11:11,080
That's how you know that the carnal ones, the romantic love one, is the least serious because it's the top of this going down that funnel, which is the inferno.

103
00:11:09,521 --> 00:11:14,600
When you get to the bottom of the inferno, you get the worst sinner of all.

104
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:17,801
Obviously, Satan is going to be down there.

105
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:20,921
And so now you see that.

106
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:23,081
So things get worse and worse.

107
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:28,761
And now we're going to look at the circle of the committed lovers.

108
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:33,321
Because Dante is so close to them.

109
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:40,361
Because after all, they were influenced by the chivalric love stories.

110
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:55,321
Powell and Francesca, who are now the people we're going to talk about from now on, who were the big stars in what would be something like, it isn't People magazine, what do people read to find out what the latest stars are, who's involved with whom, and so forth.

111
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,560
That was the big news in Florence, anyway.

112
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:03,881
Powell and Francesca were lovers, and lo and behold, they were caught by her husband and he killed them.

113
00:12:03,881 --> 00:12:06,201
And that was pretty sensational.

114
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:14,600
And they became lovers from reading one of these chivalric stories about Lancelot.

115
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:26,041
And Dante, his love, his lady Beatrice, one of the things that saves Dante from a fate similar to this is that Beatrice is dead.

116
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:31,881
So Dante isn't tempted to run off with her and commit adultery or she run off with her husband.

117
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:37,241
But his kind of addiction to Beatrice is very similar.

118
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,241
And if it's different, we won't find out for a long time how it's different.

119
00:12:41,881 --> 00:12:46,921
Now, and what is their punishment?

120
00:12:46,921 --> 00:12:49,880
Well, their punishment, now, what do you expect?

121
00:12:49,881 --> 00:13:03,921
It ought to be whatever, the dark side, which they tend to overlook or just accept of their way of life, of their character, of what the main thing is for them, is.

122
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,560
And having read it, can you tell?

123
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,080
I mean, Dante's very subtle.

124
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:13,281
He doesn't just hit you over the head with what's wrong with that form of life.

125
00:13:13,281 --> 00:13:16,001
He sort of embodies it in the punishment.

126
00:13:16,641 --> 00:13:18,161
Do you remember what's happened?

127
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,320
What's their problem when they're in this circle?

128
00:13:23,521 --> 00:13:25,440
What's their form of torture?

129
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,361
Well, I'll explain it, but I mean, this is how you have to ask yourself as you go.

130
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,681
But I'll give you a demonstration.

131
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:41,681
Their problem is that they are swept around in a kind of constant storm.

132
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:47,201
At the bottom of 58, this is now in Canto 5, line 27.

133
00:13:47,200 --> 00:14:05,041
I came to a place stripped bare of every light and roaring on the naked dark like seas racked by the war of winds, their hellish flight, of storm and counterstorm through time foregone, sweeps the soul of the man of the damned, whirling and battering, it drives them on.

134
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:13,361
So that means that he's taken up a kind of metaphor about passionate lovers.

135
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:17,121
And it's that it can be like a storm.

136
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:25,921
It can be very full of ups and downs and jealousies and fights and making up and so forth.

137
00:14:25,921 --> 00:14:30,001
It's definitely not a peaceful way of life.

138
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,081
And he's dramatizing that passion is a storm.

139
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:39,041
You can see that on page 59.

140
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,881
Three cantos from there, he says, well, let's start at the top of 59.

141
00:14:45,881 --> 00:14:56,761
And this, I learned, was the never-ending flight of those who sinned in the flesh, the carnal and the lusty, who betrayed reason to their appetite.

142
00:14:56,761 --> 00:15:00,440
Now, there's so many things going on at once in Dante.

143
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:09,401
People write books and books about how there's a symbolic level and a biblical level and a literal level and a, I don't know, that's just a waste of time.

144
00:15:09,641 --> 00:15:11,320
Dante did write about that.

145
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:20,361
What's important going on is that you're getting a description by Virgil of something Virgil doesn't really understand.

146
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:29,320
Because all of these things look different once Jesus has come and you have the creation as your perspective.

147
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,520
It would take me a while to explain little by little how they look different.

148
00:15:32,521 --> 00:15:34,601
By the end of today, you will understand.

149
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,560
But it is a very Virgil thing to say that they betrayed reason to their appetite.

150
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,041
I mean, that's what he might say about Dido.

151
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:51,720
That's his stoic view that you should always be rational and have self-control and never let your base desires get out of hand.

152
00:15:51,720 --> 00:16:00,681
You've got to keep them under control and then pose a form on that unruly aspect of what it is to be a human being.

153
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:17,161
Okay, so, and now we say, skipping a stanza, here they are up, down, they whirl, and whirling string with never a hope of hope to comfort them, nor of release, or even of less pain.

154
00:16:17,161 --> 00:16:22,760
So their pain is simply their being battered around.

155
00:16:23,081 --> 00:16:25,200
They have no repose.

156
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,721
You'll see, they have no peace.

157
00:16:24,601 --> 00:16:31,040
They know it, and they are not happy about that.

158
00:16:31,361 --> 00:16:35,921
But they wouldn't give each other up for peace and repose.

159
00:16:35,921 --> 00:16:38,161
So they're stuck in this.

160
00:16:39,121 --> 00:16:45,601
It's wrong to say, as Virgil did, and when we get the Italian, which we're about to do, we'll find out.

161
00:16:45,601 --> 00:16:56,881
Beatrice, note this one, on tanto 5, line about 42 or something, the tanto just above the one of we're up and down.

162
00:16:56,881 --> 00:17:07,921
As the wings of wintering starlings bear them on in their great wheeling flight, just so the blast wearies these evil souls through time foregone.

163
00:17:08,881 --> 00:17:10,881
You see anything funny about that?

164
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:13,600
Are they evil?

165
00:17:14,161 --> 00:17:21,440
Are our sort of knights and ladies who are totally committed to each other and constantly in a turmoil?

166
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:27,281
I don't know where knights and ladies are because they don't get together very often.

167
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,520
But I mean, say romantic lovers then.

168
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,681
Are romantic lovers evil?

169
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:36,401
Well, they are to Chiardi because carnal lovers, oh, but not in marriage.

170
00:17:36,401 --> 00:17:37,520
Oh, good grief.

171
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,921
But that's not Dante's problem.

172
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,560
The translation I gather is not evil but unhappy souls.

173
00:17:46,561 --> 00:17:50,161
And of course that would make perfect sense, but we're going to check it out.

174
00:17:51,121 --> 00:17:54,320
Now, so any questions yet or any objections?

175
00:17:54,321 --> 00:17:58,401
I'm just going to go through this so you can see what it's like to read one of these cantos.

176
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,560
Yes, yes.

177
00:18:02,561 --> 00:18:06,641
And that's how it is in Limbo, too, already in Dante.

178
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,440
It's a continuation of what their life was.

179
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,520
But it isn't always, and then it's sort of unfortunate.

180
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,080
But when he's doing his best, it is.

181
00:18:17,081 --> 00:18:20,520
And this is one of his best, because he feels so close to it.

182
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,200
So let's go on here.

183
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:26,921
They really have got sinners at a certain point on the way down.

184
00:18:26,921 --> 00:18:31,161
And before the end of today, I'm going to tell you where sin starts.

185
00:18:31,161 --> 00:18:34,760
Sin starts where the city of sin starts.

186
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,440
And we haven't got to, we're in the suburbs of sin right now.

187
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,681
That is, we're in the fields and marshes and winds and swamps.

188
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:48,520
If you look at these punishments, they're all out in the suburbs or in the fields.

189
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,241
We haven't actually got to Sin City yet.

190
00:18:51,561 --> 00:18:53,080
We get there eventually.

191
00:18:53,081 --> 00:18:56,600
So now we're going to concentrate on the lovers.

192
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:05,800
They're being swept about in their ups and downs, elations and depressions that Dante thinks goes with romantic love.

193
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:11,800
And the question is, so what exactly have they done wrong to get them into this?

194
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:17,000
Well, Virgil's version we just heard was they lack self-control.

195
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,200
They've got reasons of their appetite, a very stoic answer.

196
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,000
I don't think that's Dante's answer.

197
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,240
I think Dante's answer is that they worshiped each other.

198
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,240
Or they either worshipped sex or they worshiped or adored each other.

199
00:19:33,641 --> 00:19:42,921
It's a question of putting something in the place of God that they've done, but in a very wonderful way, I mean, because they're at least very committed.

200
00:19:42,921 --> 00:19:50,761
So you find this out on 59 further down, the middle of the page, roughly, line 40-something.

201
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,641
I can't read it.

202
00:19:51,641 --> 00:19:53,561
Line 50, maybe I've scribbled over it.

203
00:19:53,561 --> 00:19:54,960
Line 50, roughly.

204
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,280
He's talking about the various people they saw.

205
00:19:57,601 --> 00:20:05,121
I just want to show you that there's the people who actually worship sex, and then there are the people who actually worship each other, I think.

206
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,080
But here's one of the made idols.

207
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:16,001
For the first of these, of whose history you should know, he answered, was empress of many tongues, mad sensuality corrupted her soul.

208
00:20:16,321 --> 00:20:21,681
And then the footnote says she was a queen and she made phallic idols and so forth.

209
00:20:21,681 --> 00:20:25,360
And that's, and that's Cimmeranus, it says.

210
00:20:25,361 --> 00:20:29,921
And so we're skipping down now to 60.

211
00:20:29,921 --> 00:20:35,760
The other is Dido that he sees, faithless to the ashes of Scythius.

212
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,760
She killed herself for love.

213
00:20:38,081 --> 00:20:40,401
Well, I guess that's in there.

214
00:20:40,401 --> 00:20:44,720
We should look at the Italian, but I can't believe we're going to get our way out of this one.

215
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,561
It makes it look like Dido's problem was that she wasn't loyal to her husband, who was dead.

216
00:20:50,561 --> 00:21:00,560
I mean, that seems to be asking an awful lot of, I don't know, any system of ethics that would condemn somebody just for not being faithful to their dead husband.

217
00:21:00,561 --> 00:21:02,720
I mean, I don't know what Dante's thinking here.

218
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,321
Well, oh, it's Virgil talking.

219
00:21:04,321 --> 00:21:06,401
Ah, well, that helps.

220
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:20,240
Virgil does say that, does condemn her for that in his amazingly sort of Puritan Protestant way, but you can't say that about Virgil, but his very moralistic story.

221
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:31,921
He does say that he shouldn't have, I mean, he says at least that she shouldn't have had sex with Aeneas until they were married.

222
00:21:31,921 --> 00:21:35,440
I mean, this is not a Dante-ish frame of mind.

223
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:57,881
So it's not that she was faithless to the ashes of Sicius, but she did kill herself for love because she let herself get out of control over total passion for Aeneas, and that's a life that leads her to running around the streets of Carthage.

224
00:21:57,881 --> 00:21:58,520
Is that the name?

225
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,600
Raving lad with bloodshot eyes and so forth.

226
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:06,600
She was definitely caught up in a kind of storm.

227
00:22:06,601 --> 00:22:15,240
And Cleopatra gets into it, and Helen, from whom such ill arose, which is interesting.

228
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,681
Helen didn't die for love.

229
00:22:18,681 --> 00:22:21,641
She was swept away by Paris.

230
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:28,521
And Virgil just condemns her for the bad effects.

231
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:33,881
Virgil hasn't got a very sensible, worked-out ethics, I don't think.

232
00:22:33,881 --> 00:22:37,800
I mean, and charting always makes it worse, so let's not worry about that.

233
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,881
But on the top of 60, we get the people we're interested in.

234
00:22:41,881 --> 00:22:55,080
And Paris and Tristan, I mean, these, funny, he's got this, Paris, I take it, is the one who ran off with Helen, but then Tristan goes with Isolda, and those are part of the chivalry kind of love.

235
00:22:55,321 --> 00:22:58,761
The romantic, they're the beginning of romantic love.

236
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:05,881
And they whirl about, and all of these people are torn from the mortal life by love.

237
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,560
That's interesting.

238
00:23:07,561 --> 00:23:09,000
Not Helen.

239
00:23:09,641 --> 00:23:11,401
That's very strange.

240
00:23:11,401 --> 00:23:14,520
Helen's doing fine, as we remember.

241
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,120
So what's going on here?

242
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,720
See, Helen, this this is Virgil talking, isn't it?

243
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,801
And I, yes, it's Virgil talking.

244
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,800
I've never noticed this before.

245
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,120
He just got it wrong.

246
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,480
He's always getting it wrong.

247
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:30,080
I'm going to show you in a in a minute where he really gets things wrong.

248
00:23:24,601 --> 00:23:30,721
But let's go on.

249
00:23:30,881 --> 00:23:36,720
I stood there while my teacher was teacher one by one named the great knights and ladies of dim past.

250
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,080
There it is out there.

251
00:23:38,081 --> 00:23:40,080
That's the really important thing.

252
00:23:40,081 --> 00:23:42,641
There are all the romantic lovers.

253
00:23:42,641 --> 00:23:46,641
And I was swept by pity and confusion.

254
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:54,960
Notice the difference between feeling pity for them and condemning them as evil souls who betrayed their reason to their appetite.

255
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:03,200
It doesn't sound like courtly love, like knights and ladies to portray their reason to their appetite and be sinners.

256
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,360
No, he feels pity for them because they got swept away.

257
00:24:07,361 --> 00:24:09,361
And that's in the next stanza.

258
00:24:09,361 --> 00:24:13,521
And as I spoke, and then at last I spoke.

259
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,161
Up to now, it looks like Virgil's been speaking, though why was there no end of quotation marks?

260
00:24:18,161 --> 00:24:20,401
I'm very puzzled.

261
00:24:20,401 --> 00:24:23,121
It starts quotation marks from the middle of 59.

262
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:23,921
Where do they end?

263
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:27,521
60 that ah, Paris, I see, good.

264
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,240
It ends after Tristan.

265
00:24:30,561 --> 00:24:35,601
Well, who says a thousand shades of those torn from immortal life by love?

266
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:37,600
Dante, I guess.

267
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,121
But he's got Helen in him.

268
00:24:39,121 --> 00:24:42,081
I doubt if the Italian's going to fix that, but it isn't a big deal.

269
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:50,960
I mean, it's not something we should worry about, although you'd think after, you know, thousands of years of worshiping this book, people might have noticed and done and worried about it.

270
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,720
Anyway, I'm not going to worry about it.

271
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,720
So there are the great light knights and ladies.

272
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,320
That's the crucial thing.

273
00:24:56,321 --> 00:24:58,080
And then at last I spoke.

274
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:02,960
Poet, I should be glad to speak a word with those two swept together.

275
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,281
Remember the storm again, and Helen was swept off by Paris?

276
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:12,601
That's part of our our vocabulary still that's being put into the wind story.

277
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:18,520
Those two swept together so lightly on the wind and still so sad.

278
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,641
Lightly on the wind.

279
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,281
My eyes are being opened for the first time.

280
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:27,240
I've read this over and over, and I don't know what to make of all the contradictions in there.

281
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:38,440
Lightly on the wind, because we've heard how they are battered and squashed around and storm and counterstorm on 58, and whirling and battered, it drives them on.

282
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,480
And now we discover lightly on the wind.

283
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,561
Anyone got any help there?

284
00:25:43,561 --> 00:25:44,040
I don't know.

285
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,960
Dante can't seem to.

286
00:25:46,200 --> 00:26:00,040
I think, you know, what I want to say about it is Dante is so confused about it because, on the one hand, he's condemning them and showing that this life is not a life anybody would want to live for eternity.

287
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,601
And on the other hand, he's so attracted by them.

288
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:03,960
You got to help me?

289
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,161
Ah, so weightless on the wind.

290
00:26:07,161 --> 00:26:08,040
Wow.

291
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,681
Good.

292
00:26:08,681 --> 00:26:09,641
You fixed it.

293
00:26:09,641 --> 00:26:18,760
I mean, every time I suspect that if you look carefully and you discover that it doesn't make sense, it's almost always the translator.

294
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,921
It isn't as if I could find a better translation.

295
00:26:20,921 --> 00:26:22,521
There would be just different mistakes.

296
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,921
Translators don't seem to understand what they translate.

297
00:26:24,921 --> 00:26:26,840
It seems to be a requirement.

298
00:26:26,841 --> 00:26:31,720
But anyway, that would help a lot, because then they can be battered all they want.

299
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,841
Thank you.

300
00:26:33,161 --> 00:26:35,720
Okay, I'm still back to where I am now.

301
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,921
So where am I?

302
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,721
Can we look at this language?

303
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:46,121
So constant turmoil of two people who have only each other as their whole world.

304
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,560
They have nothing else than their commitment.

305
00:26:49,561 --> 00:26:54,200
And that makes their relation their lives unstable.

306
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:03,760
And so it's a different, and it's all got to do with the sort of total dependency on each other.

307
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,161
They have no freedom, no peace of mind.

308
00:27:08,161 --> 00:27:12,801
And I guess, I don't know about no fulfillment.

309
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,681
I've written that in my notes, but I think that's wrong.

310
00:27:15,681 --> 00:27:20,641
They have fulfillment plus suffering.

311
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:24,080
So they have no, I mean no peace.

312
00:27:24,081 --> 00:27:25,681
That's what their problem.

313
00:27:26,321 --> 00:27:33,440
I mean, they really love each other, and they really love blowing around in the wind, hugging each other.

314
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:41,040
There's some kind of fulfillment in that, but it's a kind of life that you wouldn't want to lead uninterrupted for eternity.

315
00:27:42,321 --> 00:27:45,840
And Dante admires them very much.

316
00:27:45,841 --> 00:27:48,161
So I'm going to go back at 59.

317
00:27:48,161 --> 00:27:51,520
We've looked at all the places where they get admired.

318
00:27:52,161 --> 00:27:57,681
And 60, we've looked at that.

319
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,200
No, here's the middle.

320
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,960
Again, this is like the weight list.

321
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:10,960
I mean, Dante is certainly less hard on them than Virgil, about line 80, as mating doves that love calls to their nest.

322
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,200
I mean, look at the metaphor.

323
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:20,480
Gliding through the air with motionless, raised wings, borne by the sweet desire that fills each breast.

324
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,121
How does sweet desire relate to appetite?

325
00:28:23,121 --> 00:28:24,960
Well, that's not a mistake.

326
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,240
Virgil is the one who says, sort of, that their appetites were driving them.

327
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,681
Dante says their sweet desire still leaves breast.

328
00:28:33,681 --> 00:28:36,320
That's a very different story of romantic love.

329
00:28:36,321 --> 00:28:37,841
It doesn't fit Digo either.

330
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,121
Sweet desire didn't fill her breast.

331
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:42,600
It was sort of furious passion.

332
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:53,960
And so, just so those spirits turned on the torn sky from the band where Dido whirls across the air, such was the power of the pity in my cry.

333
00:28:54,280 --> 00:29:03,801
And then he says this sort of prayer for them: O living creatures, gracious, kind, and good, going this pilgrimage.

334
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,681
Would they say that to him?

335
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,161
There's the power of pity in my cry.

336
00:29:09,161 --> 00:29:10,520
Who's talking?

337
00:29:10,841 --> 00:29:13,481
A living creature, gracious, kind, and good.

338
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,000
They are talking to Dante.

339
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,520
But do we know that?

340
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,560
It's definitely them.

341
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,720
How do we know that?

342
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,000
And they speak to him.

343
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,081
He says, does he say, speak to me?

344
00:29:28,681 --> 00:29:29,321
Where?

345
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:30,921
Uh-huh.

346
00:29:30,921 --> 00:29:33,481
Oh, weary souls, pause and speak to us.

347
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:33,800
Good.

348
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,240
Dante says that.

349
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,440
And then they say, O living creature, of course, that's Dante.

350
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,280
He's the only one alive in the whole poem.

351
00:29:45,081 --> 00:29:55,881
O living creature, gracious, kind, and good, going this pilgrimage through the sick night, visit us, visiting us who stained the earth with blood.

352
00:29:56,121 --> 00:29:57,881
We're the king of time.

353
00:29:57,881 --> 00:29:59,401
And again, I don't look.

354
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,921
We want to see the Italian of that.

355
00:30:00,921 --> 00:30:04,200
I don't know why they're calling God King of time.

356
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,000
We're the king, that's God, our friend.

357
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,921
We would pray his peace on you who have pitied us.

358
00:30:10,921 --> 00:30:12,200
That's important.

359
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,161
That's the thing.

360
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,960
If you ask them, what would be the nicest thing you could ask of somebody?

361
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,800
What would they say?

362
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,161
Peace, obviously, because that's what they lack.

363
00:30:23,161 --> 00:30:32,560
They're in this constant whirlwind of passion, and they never get a chance to even relax and enjoy it in any kind of serene way.

364
00:30:32,561 --> 00:30:39,681
So when they want to pray something really good for Dante, they say they're asking peace of him.

365
00:30:40,641 --> 00:30:45,120
As long as the wind lets us pause, ask of us what you please.

366
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,361
And then she says these sort of touching things.

367
00:30:49,361 --> 00:30:51,681
Again, you keep Virgil in the background.

368
00:30:51,841 --> 00:30:53,761
This is not carnal lust.

369
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,960
This is not losing your reason to your appetites.

370
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:06,240
She says, Love, which is in gentlest hearts will soonest bloom, seize my lover with passion for that sweet body from which I was torn untriven to my doom.

371
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:14,401
Love, which permits no loved one not to love, took me so strongly with delight in him that we are one in hell as we were above.

372
00:31:14,401 --> 00:31:15,361
See, that's what I mean.

373
00:31:15,601 --> 00:31:19,280
You can hardly say that they haven't got any satisfaction.

374
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,560
It's very, they're very tender and very happy to be together.

375
00:31:24,561 --> 00:31:36,800
And that's okay, because they also are very unhappy because they're being battered around and never have a chance to rest and relax and enjoy it.

376
00:31:38,881 --> 00:31:42,720
And it's all because they loved each other somehow so totally.

377
00:31:43,681 --> 00:31:54,240
And now, oh, and when we have to say something quick about how Chiardi, in his Puritanism, gets it wrong on page 64.

378
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:00,720
Because there they're talking about how she had this passion for his sweet body.

379
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:07,480
And Chiardi gets all excited about that and says, ah, yeah, but that's exactly what's wrong with their...

380
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,561
Well, that's how the punishment takes effect.

381
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:15,880
They want each other's bodies, but they can't have them because they don't have any bodies.

382
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,760
That's what he says on page 64.

383
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:27,641
They can't, he says in footnote 102, find any pleasure in the presence of another.

384
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:36,840
And at the bottom, he says, as of that paragraph on 64, as insubstantial shades of the bodies for which they once felt such great passion.

385
00:32:36,841 --> 00:32:39,641
I have them can't come in the middle of the sentence there, can I?

386
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,240
The temptation is to interpret this line romantically.

387
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,760
Indeed, I'm falling for that temptation, and I'll show you why.

388
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,600
That is that the love of Powell and Francesca survives hell itself.

389
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:51,720
It sure does.

390
00:32:51,720 --> 00:33:00,760
The most Dantean interpretation, however, meaning Chiardi, not Dante, is that they add to one another's anguish as mutual reminders of their sin.

391
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,601
I haven't seen them doing that.

392
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:07,240
And as insubstantial shades of the bodies that once felt such great passion.

393
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,920
Now, why is that dead wrong?

394
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:16,361
Last time, if anybody is here who was there last time and listening, you ought to be able to figure this out.

395
00:33:17,001 --> 00:33:23,400
That Chiardi is saying that because they don't have bodies, that's part of what makes them suffer.

396
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:32,521
Because it looks like they're sort of hugging each other, but they can't really hug each other because they haven't got real bodies.

397
00:33:32,521 --> 00:33:34,200
And that's their punishment.

398
00:33:35,161 --> 00:33:37,001
You see any problem?

399
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,601
What's going to happen in the Day of Judgment?

400
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,521
They get their bodies back.

401
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:45,081
And what's Chiardi going to do about that?

402
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:51,961
Well, their love, that we discover that their pleasure and their pain will be more intense.

403
00:33:51,961 --> 00:33:53,880
And so that's what's going to happen.

404
00:33:53,880 --> 00:34:02,801
They're going to have great joy having their bodies back, but they're going to be more blown around and upset and turmoiled and restless than ever.

405
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,240
That's the Dante picture.

406
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:12,561
It has nothing to do with Chiardi's constant gripe against bodies and sensualities and so forth.

407
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,681
Okay, so now we're just also there.

408
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:16,480
We are.

409
00:34:18,081 --> 00:34:19,601
They're still in love.

410
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:30,961
Chiardi doesn't admit that, but it's perfect from the obvious from the one lines I just read where she talks about how her lover was seized with passion for her sweet body.

411
00:34:30,961 --> 00:34:34,161
Dante's feeling just that way about Beatrice.

412
00:34:34,161 --> 00:34:43,920
And Virgil says something on 68 that I want to talk about.

413
00:34:44,240 --> 00:35:08,641
Well, that's where, just in case you didn't write it down last time, 68, Canto 6, line 105, is where Virgil says, because he's quoting Aristotle, and that look to your science again, where he's written, the more a thing is perfect, the more it feels of pleasure and pain, and when those souls get their bodies back, they'll have more of it.

414
00:35:10,161 --> 00:35:19,281
See, as for these souls, though they can never soar to true perfection, still in the new time, that is, after the Day of Judgment, they will be nearer to it than they were before.

415
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,561
Okay, that's just to show you where I get this story.

416
00:35:25,441 --> 00:35:28,160
Oh, I just see, I used another metaphor here.

417
00:35:28,161 --> 00:35:32,240
They'll still suffer from the, they'll suffer even more from the tempests of passion.

418
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:38,321
I mean, these are the kind of things, these words that Dante's taking up to make literal in his punishment.

419
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,120
And they will still be tempestuous lovers.

420
00:35:42,681 --> 00:35:44,280
They will be better and worse off.

421
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,481
I've said that.

422
00:35:46,441 --> 00:35:54,601
And it's important to notice, again, Country Chiari's footnotes, that they're not being punished because they committed adultery.

423
00:35:54,601 --> 00:36:01,640
That's, again, sort of the our modern view, maybe, but not Dante's view.

424
00:36:01,641 --> 00:36:08,361
You notice that it isn't even mentioned that they were committing adultery when her husband came in and killed them.

425
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,441
That doesn't interest Dante a bit.

426
00:36:10,441 --> 00:36:17,161
What's good about them is that they loved each other, and what's bad about them is that they loved only each other, and that's that.

427
00:36:17,161 --> 00:36:19,640
Her husband just doesn't matter.

428
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,200
They're being punished for their whole way of life.

429
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,200
That is romantic love addiction.

430
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:33,161
And there's nothing that's bad enough and good enough for Dante.

431
00:36:33,161 --> 00:36:49,481
Even if they were, and when I go back to their fear turns to desire, even if they were offered salvation at the price of never seeing each other again, but only adoring God Himself, they wouldn't give each other up.

432
00:36:49,481 --> 00:36:51,161
That's not their nature.

433
00:36:51,161 --> 00:36:56,361
Their eternal nature is to be the lovers of each other.

434
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,361
And that's it.

435
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,200
That's their essential feature.

436
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,121
Just as Dido comes up as one of the lovers, not as the suicides.

437
00:37:06,121 --> 00:37:08,601
It's not her essential character to commit suicide.

438
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:13,161
It's her sort of essential character to lose control over Aeneas.

439
00:37:13,161 --> 00:37:19,321
She had already lost everything, control, and sort of total, she was totally dependent on her first husband.

440
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,881
He's a case of a woman who loves too much.

441
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:30,240
And that's what she is, whether she remains faithful to her first husband or Aeneas and so forth, that's not the issue.

442
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,961
And they pray for peace for him.

443
00:37:32,961 --> 00:37:35,361
And what is Dante's reaction to all this?

444
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:46,641
Seeing both the beauty of their love and the sadness of their punishment and identifying with them so much.

445
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:54,001
Then let's hear what happens when he, at the end of the canto, starting about line 130.

446
00:37:54,001 --> 00:38:06,881
For when we read, she's talking, how her fond smile was kissed by such a lover, he who is one with me, alive and dead, reads on my lips the tremor of his kiss.

447
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,841
That's already very, very nice.

448
00:38:10,161 --> 00:38:13,121
That book, and he who wrote it, was a pandara.

449
00:38:13,121 --> 00:38:16,641
That's the chivalric romance they were reading.

450
00:38:16,641 --> 00:38:18,801
And that day we read no further.

451
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,881
That was their undoing.

452
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:28,401
And as she said this, the other spirit who stood by her wept so piteously that I felt my senses reel and faint away with anguish.

453
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:35,121
I was swept by such a swoon as death is and fell like a corpse might fall to the dead floor of hell.

454
00:38:35,121 --> 00:38:37,361
In short, Dante just fainted.

455
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,400
He couldn't.

456
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:51,601
This very conflict that I've been saying sort of lurks in this, the attraction of it, how much he would like to be one of those lovers, and the sadness of that kind of love finally can't fulfill you.

457
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,280
That he's so caught in that, that he's so identified with that, that he just faints.

458
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,521
It's the only sin that he faints for.

459
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,361
Or it isn't even a sin.

460
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:10,520
The only, if you're strictly sticking to sins as what's going to be inside Sin City, then we have to find another word for it.

461
00:39:09,441 --> 00:39:16,520
It's the only wrong way of life that's getting punished that he faints for.

462
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,281
Okay, now, anybody anything to say about that?

463
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,841
Well, we got this question I want to leave you with.

464
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,480
How is Dante's story any different from theirs?

465
00:39:25,481 --> 00:39:27,000
He's so close to them.

466
00:39:27,001 --> 00:39:31,240
Is he just saved by the accident that Beatrice, lucky for him, died?

467
00:39:31,641 --> 00:39:33,720
There must be something better than that to be told.

468
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,000
He said, you have to keep your eyes open through the whole book.

469
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:42,441
And if you don't have to read the whole book, I'm giving you the excerpts to read where you will find out.

470
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:44,681
Anything else?

471
00:39:45,001 --> 00:39:48,521
Okay, I certainly want to do one more thing, and now I'm going to do it.

472
00:39:48,521 --> 00:39:52,360
I'm going to talk about the.

473
00:39:53,001 --> 00:39:54,601
I'm going to skim quickly.

474
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:57,720
I'm not even going to read to you, just to me, the rest of the incontinence.

475
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,240
I don't think I want to talk to them.

476
00:39:59,641 --> 00:40:00,840
They talk about them.

477
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,040
They're the gluttons.

478
00:40:02,041 --> 00:40:04,681
They're the collectors of material things.

479
00:40:04,681 --> 00:40:08,761
There's bigger spending eternity doing that.

480
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,761
Okay, now that's the end of that.

481
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:21,081
As I was rereading it, I hate to interrupt myself and you all, but there's a puzzle bothering me that I can't imagine why I never worried about it before.

482
00:40:21,081 --> 00:40:23,240
It's going to be all over the place.

483
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,641
What kind of love is this?

484
00:40:25,961 --> 00:40:27,880
I mean, we say it's romantic love.

485
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,161
That's right.

486
00:40:29,161 --> 00:40:31,720
But that's not agape love.

487
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:35,001
That is overflowing Christian love.

488
00:40:35,561 --> 00:40:44,840
It's got something to do with agape love, because if you have agape love for your neighbor, you're willing to do anything, including even die for your neighbor and they for you.

489
00:40:45,161 --> 00:40:51,720
But it seems this is not sort of overflowing, fulfilling love, but it's got a lot of arrows in it.

490
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:57,601
A lot of, remember, arrows is desire for something you absolutely need and lack.

491
00:40:57,601 --> 00:41:00,961
So it seems to be, and maybe romantic love is.

492
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:14,161
In fact, as I talk, and I'm beginning to think I understand it, romantic love turns out to be an interesting mixture of some aspect of Eros and some aspect of agape.

493
00:41:14,161 --> 00:41:24,720
And it's sort of made up by the troubadours, the chivalric, out of sort of these pieces left over from the Christian practices.

494
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,840
But keep your eye open.

495
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,280
Every time there's talk about love, ask yourself, what does love mean?

496
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,561
Is it desire?

497
00:41:30,561 --> 00:41:31,681
Is it charity?

498
00:41:31,681 --> 00:41:33,281
That is, is it giving?

499
00:41:34,081 --> 00:41:38,961
Is it the totalness of the commitment that Dante cares about?

500
00:41:38,961 --> 00:41:42,000
That's what I really think, and I'm thinking as I talk to you.

501
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:58,240
I think romantic love is, for Dante, important, not because it's agape, not because it's Eros, but because it is total commitment, where these people are ready to die and go to hell for each other.

502
00:41:58,961 --> 00:42:00,881
That's the crucial thing.

503
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,240
That's a new thing.

504
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,200
That's what the chivalric people invented.

505
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,281
And that's what Dante got.

506
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,320
That's what they got out of the New Testament.

507
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:16,320
And it's something different than either of the alternatives that were around before, I think.

508
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,600
Ah, yeah, Chuck.

509
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,880
No, you're not, Chuck.

510
00:42:18,961 --> 00:42:20,161
Okay, that's all right.

511
00:42:20,161 --> 00:42:21,121
Go ahead.

512
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,561
To die for the other.

513
00:42:22,561 --> 00:42:23,921
Yes, I think it is.

514
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,400
Right.

515
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,321
There is agape love in there.

516
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:36,081
But it's agape love sort of mixed in with the sensuous, erotic love, at least in the chivalric story, at least in the way Dante's telling it.

517
00:42:36,081 --> 00:42:40,120
And what do you see his reaction to, well, I won't even tell you.

518
00:42:39,601 --> 00:42:42,920
But anyway, yes, there's got to be this erotic thing.

519
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:53,480
It's as if somehow agape love got fused with erotic love, and out of that came a new conception of a romantic love.

520
00:42:53,481 --> 00:43:05,720
See, agape also has the side, not of total, it is, agape love isn't at all the total commitment to one other person, or even to one other sort of thing, like material things or food.

521
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,200
Agape love is love your neighbor.

522
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,720
That's what it is, it's love for everybody.

523
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,600
Love the one you're with and who needs you, whoever.

524
00:43:15,001 --> 00:43:16,121
So that's the funny thing.

525
00:43:16,121 --> 00:43:22,361
Agape love is getting switched into romantic love and right in front of our eyes those in Dante.

526
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:26,600
And then naturally it's sort of hard to follow because it's a moving target.

527
00:43:26,601 --> 00:43:42,921
But our Dante will come, and you'll see it more next two times from now, a new idea of love that's just not that put together out of pieces from the New Testament that is something that isn't in there until you put it together.

528
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,040
Okay, don't worry about that yet, except keep it in the back of your mind.

529
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,720
I want to go to the next piece of paper here.

530
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,520
Oh, here it is.

531
00:43:50,521 --> 00:44:06,921
Okay, the rest of the time, we've got to do something entirely different, but it's very important and lots of fun, which is what happens to Dante when he finally gets to the city of dis, which I've been calling thin city, or he calls it the translator at one point, Hell's Metropolis.

532
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,720
Because all, up to now they've been in the woods, remember.

533
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:14,681
All these people punished, the wrathful, and so forth, are all in the swamps.

534
00:44:17,161 --> 00:44:31,441
And then comes the fact that they finally get to the city of Dis on page 82 here, Panto 5, line 61, or no, it's more, yeah, 65 maybe.

535
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,400
My son, the master, said, the city called Dis lies just ahead.

536
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:43,360
This is the Roman name for Hades, who was the god of the underworld in Homer.

537
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:48,081
So this is the city of Hades, only now translated into Latin.

538
00:44:48,081 --> 00:44:55,041
So the city called Dis lies just ahead, the heavy citizens, the swarming crowds of hell's metropolis.

539
00:44:55,041 --> 00:45:01,841
And I, that master, I already see the glowing red of its mosques as if they came hot from the fort to smolder in this valley.

540
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:10,560
And my all-knowing guide, well, that was a shock when I found that, because good grief, me, Virgil has hardly got a grip on this.

541
00:45:10,561 --> 00:45:12,720
And surely Dante realizes that.

542
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,800
Well, it wasn't in the Italian, according to, we'll write down and make sure.

543
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:22,640
When I last got to ask somebody about this, this is about line 70.

544
00:45:22,641 --> 00:45:31,121
My all-knowing guide, it just says, and my guide, I hope, says, they are eternal fires of lower hell.

545
00:45:31,121 --> 00:45:33,761
And as he spoke, we entered a moat.

546
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,121
And then we come up to hell, and guess what happens?

547
00:45:37,121 --> 00:45:41,681
At the entrance, there is above the gates.

548
00:45:41,681 --> 00:45:42,640
There are gates.

549
00:45:42,641 --> 00:45:43,681
There's a wall.

550
00:45:43,681 --> 00:45:44,801
There's gates.

551
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,521
I wouldn't make a big fuss about the wall and the gates, except everything's going to turn on that in a minute.

552
00:45:49,521 --> 00:46:01,041
Above the gates, more than a thousand shades or spirits purged from heaven for its glory cried, Who is that that invades death's kingdom in his life?

553
00:46:02,161 --> 00:46:06,961
Now, everything is already in there, but it's packed in there.

554
00:46:06,961 --> 00:46:17,961
Who could these creatures be who are on the wall and who are said to be purged from heaven for its glory?

555
00:46:17,961 --> 00:46:19,481
You know who they are?

556
00:46:19,481 --> 00:46:21,240
The fallen angels.

557
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:36,360
The fallen angels have taken up and got ticked out of paradise and they have set up their own city, namely the city of Dis, with Satan who got taken, who was the leader of the people, the angels who got ticked out.

558
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,801
That's all got to be there.

559
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:44,601
And they take this as an invasion because they are defending themselves against God.

560
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:47,321
Now, you've got to know why they would be doing that.

561
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,961
And the answer is sort of complicated.

562
00:46:49,961 --> 00:46:59,561
Milton understood it well in Paradise Lost, where Satan says at one point, better to rule in hell than serve in heaven.

563
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,521
So what is it?

564
00:47:00,521 --> 00:47:23,961
These are the angels who, even though contemplating God on his terms, gets you complete bliss, they would rather be autonomous, interestingly enough, free, able to choose the terms on which they love and what they love and how much they love, and not be, in effect, sort of just homing missiles aimed at God.

565
00:47:23,961 --> 00:47:36,840
I put it in that funny way because Augustine says that God has created us so that, quote, our soul is restless until it finds rest in thee, namely God.

566
00:47:37,161 --> 00:47:46,841
So it's part of this creation understanding of being, that God has created all these creatures, us, and he's built in us a need.

567
00:47:47,081 --> 00:47:48,760
This is sort of anagape.

568
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,760
This is sort of more like Errow's talk.

569
00:47:51,161 --> 00:48:03,440
He's built in us a need for contemplating God, and we won't, we'll be restless like Paul and Francesco or in any other way, until we find peace.

570
00:48:03,441 --> 00:48:08,081
And the only way to find peace and fulfillment is to contemplate God.

571
00:48:08,081 --> 00:48:10,321
But you've got to do it on God's terms.

572
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:20,720
And the fallen angels would rather be free and making up the meaning of their lives on their own terms, that is, autonomous.

573
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:30,401
So they went and set up city where Satan rules and everybody rejects God.

574
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,720
Now, now comes the fun part.

575
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:38,961
Virgil wants to get into this fortress.

576
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:54,720
But Virgil has no understanding that autonomy and self-control and sort of giving the law to yourself is a sin.

577
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,401
Because you have to have the whole framework of the creation to see that.

578
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:14,801
It's only if, one, we're created with a need for total fulfillment, and two, God's created us so that He satisfies that need for total fulfillment, that then self-control and autonomy becomes a sin.

579
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:28,720
But if, as at the time of Virgil, there's nothing satisfied in the universe, and if you've got a lot of desire, you can't just satisfy it by contemplating God.

580
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:35,760
You have to curb it, control it, and bring it down to whatever it is that you desire can fulfill.

581
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:49,720
So you get a middle-sized desire for sex and romantic love, and maybe an even smaller desire for food, and a little desire for material things, because they can each fulfill you somewhat.

582
00:49:49,720 --> 00:50:07,720
But the idea that you should have no control, but be totally open through contemplating God, that's only possible once God creates you as a need for him.

583
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:13,560
That's what I call he creates you as a homing missile, which you flounder around for a while.

584
00:50:13,561 --> 00:50:27,000
Beatrice explains this later, until you finally manage to point just directly toward God, because the things that you go after when you're a child and so forth don't satisfy you, and even your lover doesn't satisfy you.

585
00:50:27,001 --> 00:50:29,961
But finally, you get honed in on God.

586
00:50:29,961 --> 00:50:33,240
You were made to be satisfied by God, and he will satisfy you.

587
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,520
All that's in the background.

588
00:50:34,521 --> 00:50:36,200
But Virgil doesn't know any of that.

589
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,400
So what does Virgil do?

590
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,600
He goes up to the wall and he says something.

591
00:50:40,601 --> 00:50:42,761
This is the fun where Dante's having fun.

592
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:54,441
And where you get the impression that Dante is really very smart and knows exactly what he's up to, playing Virgil off against Christianity.

593
00:50:54,441 --> 00:50:59,161
The most important moment that happens is right now at the wall.

594
00:50:59,161 --> 00:51:03,720
Because the interesting issue is, what's a wall of?

595
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:11,321
Is it a wall of a fortress to keep God and angels and everybody else out?

596
00:51:11,641 --> 00:51:17,000
Or is it a prison that is there to keep the bad guys?

597
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,481
Virgil thinks it's a prison.

598
00:51:21,481 --> 00:51:27,921
But the shades on the wall have said, which are the fallen angels, who invades this kingdom?

599
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:37,761
So now Virgil goes up to the front door of this something or other, which has a wall, and says at the gate, something, but we don't know what.

600
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,121
And then funny things happen.

601
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,200
The bottom of 83, Canto 110.

602
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:53,200
My sweet guide leaves me, and I stay in doubt with yes and no, dividing all my heart with hope and fear poor Dante's been abandoned by his guide.

603
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,280
I could not hear my lord's words.

604
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,800
That means Virgil's words.

605
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,801
It's not God with a capital L.

606
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:08,001
But the pack that gathered round him suddenly broke away, howling and jostling and went pouring back, slamming the towering gate hard in his face.

607
00:52:08,001 --> 00:52:10,161
That great soul, that's Virgil again.

608
00:52:10,161 --> 00:52:14,481
I don't know why all these capital letters, stood alone outside the wall.

609
00:52:14,481 --> 00:52:15,761
Then he came back.

610
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,240
His pain showed in his face.

611
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,160
His eyes were fixed on the ground.

612
00:52:20,161 --> 00:52:23,521
His vows sagged from its assurance.

613
00:52:23,521 --> 00:52:25,841
And what did he say?

614
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,681
Dante leaves you with this little puzzle.

615
00:52:27,681 --> 00:52:29,840
Virgil said something, and it had a big result.

616
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,081
Bang, they ran in, they slammed the door.

617
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,920
He's completely confused.

618
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,361
He didn't know what to think.

619
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,800
What did he say?

620
00:52:38,081 --> 00:52:40,161
Somebody must be able to figure it out.

621
00:52:40,161 --> 00:52:42,480
It's totally stand up.

622
00:52:43,521 --> 00:52:44,881
Well, let's look at it this way.

623
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,760
What is Virgil's understanding of what he's doing, leading Dante around?

624
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,800
Who sent him to lead?

625
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,960
Beatrice sent him to lead.

626
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:57,041
And under whose authority did Beatrice do it?

627
00:52:58,001 --> 00:53:02,240
Well, God's, of course, but it's particular of the Virgin Mary, I think.

628
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,761
I forget the details.

629
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,761
But anyway, what Virgil said was: we're on a divine mission.

630
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,641
We're sent here by God.

631
00:53:09,641 --> 00:53:12,601
And boy, did that not produce the results he expected.

632
00:53:09,121 --> 00:53:14,681
They produced exactly the opposite.

633
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:21,720
To say that he's sent there by God and they all slam the door and run in, and Virgil can't understand what went on.

634
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:30,440
And he says that, well, we don't need to know what more he says right here.

635
00:53:30,441 --> 00:53:31,720
Let me go on to where they are.

636
00:53:31,961 --> 00:53:33,161
They're blocked.

637
00:53:33,161 --> 00:53:37,000
And then, so Virgil's very confused.

638
00:53:37,001 --> 00:53:45,401
By the way, I'm telling you this all because you can see that Virgil doesn't understand the architecture and landscape of the inferno.

639
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:52,761
That is, he doesn't understand the big divisions, like this wall between this and what's outside and what's inside.

640
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:55,161
Virgil hasn't got the categories.

641
00:53:55,161 --> 00:54:02,281
Even when he brings in the Stoics and when he brings in Aristotle, he still hasn't got the right distinctions.

642
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:20,841
Because there's this distinction, this crucial distinction, between the people who love too much, whose love is misdirected, and the people who reject God, who are sinners because they're trying to set themselves up as independent of God.

643
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,081
That's a hugely important distinction.

644
00:54:23,081 --> 00:54:30,440
That's the difference between the incontinent outside and the real sinners in Sin City, in the city of this.

645
00:54:30,441 --> 00:54:32,521
But he doesn't understand any of that.

646
00:54:32,521 --> 00:54:36,681
But Dante, and Dante doesn't even really understand it, because he's just a pilgrim.

647
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:41,961
He's reporting what he experienced at each stage, not what he understood later.

648
00:54:41,961 --> 00:54:45,081
So, because he's telling the story of his experience.

649
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:47,161
So, there's three possible things.

650
00:54:47,161 --> 00:54:49,961
There's Virgil's point of view, which has got it all wrong.

651
00:54:49,961 --> 00:55:06,481
Dante's point of view, that sort of suspects that Virgil's got it all wrong, it doesn't know what's right, and the landscape of the inferno, which is written, built by God, and reflects exactly the right distinctions, because those are God's distinctions.

652
00:55:06,481 --> 00:55:09,281
So, and Dante can't understand that.

653
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:18,480
He can't understand the Christian world, can't understand creation, he can't, that is, he can only understand production, reason, duty.

654
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:24,240
None of those explain why these people are trying not to let Dante into hell.

655
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,880
He can't understand rebellion against the divine.

656
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,640
That's a Christian category.

657
00:55:30,641 --> 00:55:31,121
Yeah.

658
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,601
Yes, that's right.

659
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:42,720
They have chosen to, it's odd, and of course, again, in real life, it didn't look to them so awful, or they wouldn't have done it, I suppose.

660
00:55:42,720 --> 00:56:04,480
But they have chosen to substitute for the goods that God has strewn all around the world instead of getting their desire in exact proportion to how fulfilling things are, so that bit by bit they will finally be led to contemplate God, because then they will have total desire for what's totally fulfilling.

661
00:56:04,481 --> 00:56:06,401
That's Dante's picture.

662
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:14,720
They have rejected all that and substituted their own desires for those.

663
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:20,561
The extremist example, which we don't have time to look at, is what happens to the homosexuals in hell.

664
00:56:20,561 --> 00:56:31,280
The homosexuals in hell are a perfect example of having freely and autonomously rejected the natural sexual impulses.

665
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:39,441
That's how it looks to Dante, and substituted something that they have freely chosen as what they're going to get satisfaction from.

666
00:56:39,720 --> 00:57:02,441
And therefore, they're inside of hell, and they're punished with a sort of stupid punishment, running around on sand because it's barren, they don't have any kids, and stung by falling flakes of flame because they're all sort of excited, and running around in sort of crops, because I think Dante thinks the homosexuals in hell are all promiscuous.

667
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:15,001
What's interesting about Dante is there are more homosexuals at the top of the Paradiso, homosexual poets, and mostly, and at the top of Paradiso is near a paradise as you can get.

668
00:57:15,001 --> 00:57:17,081
And they are lovers.

669
00:57:17,081 --> 00:57:19,000
And Dante just loves lovers.

670
00:57:19,001 --> 00:57:23,401
It doesn't matter what sex they are, or the same or opposite.

671
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:33,321
And in fact, Dante knows all the names of the famous homosexuals, knows personally all these famous homosexuals, which has led people to suspect that maybe Dante himself was bisexual.

672
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:48,200
But there's a certain kind of homosexual, anyway, which Dante does not approve of, puts in hell because they have substituted their own understanding of what's fulfilling with what's natural and fulfilling.

673
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,760
And so that's sort of an answer to you.

674
00:57:50,760 --> 00:58:00,761
And all of them, you have to understand that all of them have substituted something that they've chosen for what is naturally satisfying.

675
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:06,841
And it gets worse and worse as they go down, what they substitute, and how unsatisfying it is.

676
00:58:07,161 --> 00:58:07,880
Any questions?

677
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:08,920
Because that was important.

678
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,521
Okay, I'm going on, Dave.

679
00:58:12,041 --> 00:58:15,161
So there are these fallen angels guarding the city.

680
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:17,960
Virgil slips up.

681
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:20,041
He doesn't understand what's going on.

682
00:58:20,041 --> 00:58:20,920
Okay.

683
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:28,881
These are the angels and the sinners who rebel against God.

684
00:58:24,121 --> 00:58:32,961
And Virgil doesn't understand the very concept of rebellion.

685
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,801
He doesn't understand that it's actually sin.

686
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,560
So he thinks that hell is a prison.

687
00:58:38,561 --> 00:58:40,641
I mean, we've already seen that, that's what he thinks.

688
00:58:40,641 --> 00:58:48,321
But he says it explicitly in Canto 6, line about 20.

689
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:55,280
He's explaining to Dante those who are on the other side of the wall.

690
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:00,240
And he says, you must understand their sins at sight.

691
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,600
I will explain how each is imprisoned and why.

692
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,560
So that's the very middle of page 104.

693
00:59:06,561 --> 00:59:11,921
So Virgil really thinks that that's a prison, even though it's clearly a fortress.

694
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:16,001
After all, think again how their fear turned to desire.

695
00:59:16,001 --> 00:59:19,440
If they were imprisoned, it would mean that they would want to get out.

696
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,120
And I'm glad Vikas found this line because it's very important.

697
00:59:23,441 --> 00:59:25,200
They don't want to get out.

698
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,561
They want these people from God to get out.

699
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:33,921
They've chosen the situation they're in.

700
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,240
Again, the homosexual, just as an example.

701
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:42,641
They've chosen to make, to choose for themselves what satisfies them and to pursue it.

702
00:59:42,641 --> 00:59:45,121
And that's not being imprisoned.

703
00:59:45,121 --> 00:59:47,681
They just want to be left alone to do it.

704
00:59:47,681 --> 00:59:52,321
Okay, so now we've got to see where I am again.

705
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:57,840
So Virgil, well, then comes this funny little tactful thing that Dante says, back to 88.

706
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:04,160
Dante's really having fun with this, and this is the most fun place I know in the whole three themes.

707
01:00:04,481 --> 01:00:09,441
Dante tactfully begins to realize that Virgil doesn't know what's going on.

708
01:00:09,641 --> 01:00:25,481
So on page 88, Panto 9, line 15, he says, Tell me, Master, does anyone, this is very cute, does anyone ever come from the first ledge, that's from Limbo, whose only punishment is hope cut off, into this dreary bottom?

709
01:00:25,481 --> 01:00:27,240
He doesn't say, he's too tactful.

710
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,280
Do you know where we are?

711
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,560
Have you ever been here before?

712
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,640
What right do you have to be a guide?

713
01:00:31,641 --> 01:00:34,521
He's done it in this sort of impersonal way.

714
01:00:34,521 --> 01:00:44,200
And Virgil understands that he's asking for his credentials, and he says, Yeah, once before, it's true, I crossed through hell, and how did he get away with it?

715
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:48,921
Conjured by Erictho, who recalled these spirits to their body.

716
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:52,041
Her dark spell forced me, and so forth and so forth.

717
01:00:52,121 --> 01:00:54,921
Erico, it says in the footnote, his own witch.

718
01:00:54,920 --> 01:01:04,280
Well, he was on a, on a, not on a divine mission, but on a witchy mission, whatever the right word for that is.

719
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:09,161
And so, when he went to the gate of hell last time, what happened?

720
01:01:09,161 --> 01:01:10,521
The gate of Sin City.

721
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:14,920
He said, I've come here and I have the authority to come here because I'm sent here by a witch.

722
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,080
Do you think they ran in and slammed the door?

723
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,081
No, they said, yeah, come on in.

724
01:01:19,081 --> 01:01:20,200
That's nice.

725
01:01:20,521 --> 01:01:30,441
And it's interesting that what's cruel about Eric, though, I only noticed that this time through, is that he recalled the spirits to their bodies.

726
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:34,280
Well, that's a funny thing for somebody to say.

727
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,681
But it's not a funny thing for Virgil to say.

728
01:01:36,681 --> 01:01:38,760
Because remember, they don't want their bodies.

729
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:41,081
They wish they were dead in the Aeneid.

730
01:01:41,161 --> 01:01:42,600
They're sluggish bodies.

731
01:01:42,601 --> 01:01:50,600
Here, instead of the blessing that you get on the day of judgment, hooray, you get your body back.

732
01:01:50,601 --> 01:01:51,760
There's a curse.

733
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:57,681
When somebody puts a curse on you and puts a witch after you, this witch can make you have to take your body back.

734
01:01:57,681 --> 01:02:00,240
It's just, everything is upside down.

735
01:01:54,521 --> 01:02:01,520
Okay, we've got that now.

736
01:02:01,681 --> 01:02:04,561
So he says he has a right to be there.

737
01:02:04,561 --> 01:02:05,921
He knows what he's doing.

738
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:09,041
He was sent there by this witch.

739
01:02:09,041 --> 01:02:13,521
and so forth and they say, yeah, come on in, and so forth.

740
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:21,521
So he doesn't get the difference between being on a mission sanctioned by the Virgin Mary and sanctioned by a witch.

741
01:02:21,521 --> 01:02:24,001
I think that's pretty far gone.

742
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:29,921
He does see that it has a big difference in effect, and that's what happens.

743
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:33,281
But he doesn't understand the significance of the law.

744
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:37,520
Now, this much I think is clearly in the book.

745
01:02:37,521 --> 01:02:41,040
If you think I'm over-interpreting, you should come and complain in office hour.

746
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:42,880
It's a big temptation in Dante.

747
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:57,281
If you read any of the literature on Dante, because he says it's got four levels of interpretation and he's happy that he's talking literally and biblically and morally and philosophically all at the same time, people read in all sorts of stuff.

748
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,601
Well, now I want to read something in.

749
01:02:59,601 --> 01:03:04,161
Now, I don't know whether it's really there or not, but I think it is.

750
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,720
But first, I see I have to say one more thing.

751
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,840
Finally, just to finish the story, how do they get into the city?

752
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:12,960
It's not all that exciting.

753
01:03:12,961 --> 01:03:19,841
On page 91 of Guitar, the only way to get in, an angel comes from God and breaks down the door.

754
01:03:20,161 --> 01:03:24,880
At the top of 91, this is Canto 9, 90.

755
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:32,481
Outcasts of heaven, this is the angel says, you twice loathsome crew, he cried upon that terrible sail of hell.

756
01:03:32,481 --> 01:03:34,400
How does this insolence still live in you?

757
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,321
You see, they're always rebelling.

758
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:41,240
Why do you set yourself against that throne whose will none can deny?

759
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:44,920
And which times past has added to your pain for each rebellion?

760
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:45,641
Well, there it is.

761
01:03:45,641 --> 01:03:48,121
I mean, it's clear it's a prison, not a fortress.

762
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:53,561
It's a fortress that they built to keep God out, and they can't do it.

763
01:03:54,521 --> 01:04:06,521
And again, where it says 105 in the margin line, 105, Dante says, I'm eager to learn what new estate of hell that burning fortress walls enclose.

764
01:04:06,521 --> 01:04:08,761
Dante understands it's a fortress.

765
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,841
Virgil never really gets it.

766
01:04:11,001 --> 01:04:13,161
That's perhaps just how it should be.

767
01:04:13,161 --> 01:04:13,720
Okay.

768
01:04:14,041 --> 01:04:17,801
And now this is a place where I say I may be going too far.

769
01:04:17,961 --> 01:04:24,521
That is, they actually start talking about the meaning of the wall.

770
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:30,681
Is Dante or isn't Dante seeing through Virgil at this point?

771
01:04:30,681 --> 01:04:32,120
I'm not sure.

772
01:04:32,441 --> 01:04:40,361
I mean, we know, so to speak, that Dante sees that hell is built in a way that Virgil doesn't understand.

773
01:04:41,081 --> 01:04:49,641
Dante is at this stage a pilgrim who has got sort of two authorities: the way the wall looks and the way Virgil's talking.

774
01:04:49,641 --> 01:04:54,600
I think he understands that Virgil's not making any sense, but I'm not sure.

775
01:04:54,601 --> 01:04:58,280
So look on Tanto 11, line 16.

776
01:04:58,601 --> 01:05:01,560
Virgil's going to explain to Dante what's going on.

777
01:05:01,561 --> 01:05:11,000
My son, he began, there are below this wall three smaller circles, and then accordingly, you have to understand, I skipped a little, their sins at sight.

778
01:05:11,001 --> 01:05:13,321
I will explain how each is prisoned.

779
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:15,321
See, he's still got that and why.

780
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:19,720
And then he goes into a whole bunch of stuff which adds nothing.

781
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:23,720
Don't waste your time trying to memorize or understand that.

782
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,640
Malice comes in two kinds: fraud and violence.

783
01:05:26,961 --> 01:05:41,121
And God loath violence more because, oddly enough, with the stupid reason that violence is something that only humans do, whereas, you know, fraud is something that only humans do, but violence is what even animals will do.

784
01:05:41,121 --> 01:05:43,281
So fraud is worse than violence.

785
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:52,081
I think really for Dante, or for God, anyway, for the Inferno itself, fraud is bad and way down because it's a betrayal of trust.

786
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:55,041
But Virgil hasn't got any of these categories.

787
01:05:55,041 --> 01:06:01,441
And so then, so violence he's got in here are for people who blaspheme.

788
01:06:01,681 --> 01:06:06,400
Notice again, and probably something wrong with the Italian on 105, line 476.

789
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:11,921
Violence may be offered the deity in the heart that blasphemes and refuses him.

790
01:06:12,081 --> 01:06:15,120
Beatrice, I hope the refuses isn't in the Italian.

791
01:06:15,121 --> 01:06:16,481
It better not be.

792
01:06:16,481 --> 01:06:18,320
Because that's refusal.

793
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:19,921
That's rebellion.

794
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,720
Virgil hasn't got any concept of refusal.

795
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,320
And then there's all kinds of stuff.

796
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,200
I'm not going to read it.

797
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:32,080
Stuff, stuff, stuff, which doesn't connect up with any of the architectural landscape distinctions.

798
01:06:32,081 --> 01:06:36,880
It's just stuff that Virgil brings in from Aristotle and so forth.

799
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,521
That's why I'm not going to read it, and you shouldn't worry about it.

800
01:06:39,521 --> 01:06:41,040
But then comes the interesting line.

801
01:06:41,041 --> 01:06:43,841
What are you going to do with this at the bottom of 105?

802
01:06:44,161 --> 01:06:45,760
Line about 70.

803
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:49,760
Master, I said, the clarity of your mind impresses all you touch.

804
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:54,161
I see quite clearly the orders of this dark pit of the blind.

805
01:06:54,161 --> 01:07:01,120
But tell me, this gets really funny, but tell me, though, we're going to find out whether Dante is stupid or smart now.

806
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:06,080
But tell me, those who lie in the swamp's bowels, those the wind blows, you know who that is.

807
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:09,200
That's the incontinent out there in the suburbs.

808
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:16,920
The wind blows, those the rain beats, those are the gluttons, and those who meet with clash and mad howls, those are the material people.

809
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:20,040
Why are they not punished in the rust red city?

810
01:07:20,281 --> 01:07:23,880
Dante wants to know what's the point of the wall.

811
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:29,641
It's pretty significant that there's a distinction between the suburbs and the city of hell.

812
01:07:29,641 --> 01:07:30,840
What is it?

813
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:34,681
And he says, Virgil gets very huffy.

814
01:07:34,681 --> 01:07:37,800
Why does your understanding stray so far from its own habit?

815
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,440
Or can it be that your thoughts are turned some other way?

816
01:07:40,441 --> 01:07:41,960
Have you forgotten your ethics?

817
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,160
That's Aristotle.

818
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:48,681
That states that the three divisions of hell are so-and-so, and upper hell, and lower hell, and so forth.

819
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:57,561
When you understand that, he says, lying about 89, you will understand at once why they are confined.

820
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:01,000
And that's apparently not in the Italian.

821
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:07,400
But of course, if it were, that would be because Virgil thinks they are confined.

822
01:08:07,401 --> 01:08:14,840
You'd understand why they are confined apart from those fierce race and why less anger beats down on them than from the eternal mind.

823
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,080
I mean, this is not getting very helpful.

824
01:08:17,401 --> 01:08:21,160
And then Dante says, I mean, Virgil has said nothing.

825
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:24,200
The interesting thing is, Dante says, why the wall?

826
01:08:24,201 --> 01:08:30,120
Virgil makes a speech that incontinence is different than malice and vestiality.

827
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:34,280
And one side of the wall is incontinence, and the other side is malice and vestiality.

828
01:08:34,281 --> 01:08:36,760
And he says, incontinence offends God least.

829
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:37,720
But why?

830
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:42,840
He hasn't got any concept there about rebellion or anything.

831
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:44,920
He hasn't got the distinction that St.

832
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:54,120
Thomas has between, let's put it in here right now, loving the wrong thing and rejecting God's love.

833
01:08:54,120 --> 01:09:06,080
And that's what the wall is: it's between the people who love the wrong thing, sex, food, materials, getting angry, and the people who reject God's love altogether, like the homosexuals, but all of them.

834
01:09:06,241 --> 01:09:09,200
Okay, so, and what does Dante say?

835
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,440
He says, where now?

836
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:16,240
Hopefully you'll understand all that, all that.

837
01:09:16,241 --> 01:09:29,920
And he says, Dante at 91, on page 106, O sun, which clears all mists from troubled sight, such joy attends your rising that I feel as grateful to the dark as to the light.

838
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,760
I wish I saw that in a pattern.

839
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,840
You see what a kind of pun that could be.

840
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:41,840
I mean, I want him to say something nice to Virgil, which, if you really understand it, says you haven't clarified a thing.

841
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:44,960
And maybe that's what he's saying, and maybe he isn't.

842
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,641
Maybe he's being ironic.

843
01:09:46,641 --> 01:09:49,760
Maybe he's just being a pilgrim who doesn't know anything yet.

844
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,040
Maybe he's stupid.

845
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,561
They can't really tell.

846
01:09:52,561 --> 01:10:10,641
But I would like to think that Dante, having cleverly set up this whole little episode at the wall where Virgil's got everything wrong, thinks that Virgil's got everything wrong and isn't going to accept an explanation from Virgil that doesn't explain the law, which is what Virgil has just given him.

847
01:10:10,641 --> 01:10:17,441
So I hope he's just trying to be nice and yet, you know, say, I didn't really get it, which you were just saying.

848
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,360
It didn't enlighten me a bit.

849
01:10:19,361 --> 01:10:22,000
Anyway, that's the way it ends there.

850
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,720
All you get from Virgil is these ad hoc explanations.

851
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:37,920
That is, ad hoc, meaning whenever there's something different from something, then Virgil makes up some kind of distinction of some kind of sin to some other kind of sin to fit it.

852
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,120
But it doesn't have any unity.

853
01:10:39,521 --> 01:10:42,521
It doesn't really get at anything deep.

854
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:53,000
Virgil, Heidegger has a funny way of talking when he says about people like Virgil, what they say is correct but not true.

855
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:58,360
By which he means they are described, Virgil's right, he describes all these distinctions.

856
01:10:58,361 --> 01:11:05,641
There really are distinctions between malice and fraud, but it's not true in the sense that it doesn't give you any deep insight.

857
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:15,561
If it helps any, the philosophers like Aristotle would say it's the difference between getting the proprium of something and the essence of something.

858
01:11:15,561 --> 01:11:18,200
You don't need to know this technical terminology.

859
01:11:18,201 --> 01:11:23,160
But they give examples like approprium is a general property.

860
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:28,920
So for instance, you can say of human beings, man is a laughing animal, the only animal that laughs.

861
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,080
Or man is a featherless biped.

862
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:34,200
It's the only featherless, two-legged thing.

863
01:11:34,201 --> 01:11:35,720
Too bad there are birds, too distant.

864
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,160
That's why you have to say featherless.

865
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:41,720
But anyway, those are general properties.

866
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:44,441
But those aren't essences.

867
01:11:44,441 --> 01:11:47,400
The essence of man is to be a rational animal.

868
01:11:47,401 --> 01:11:52,760
That's what explains all that's important about man, Aristotle would say.

869
01:11:53,000 --> 01:12:01,641
And it doesn't explain why men laugh or why human beings walk on two feet, but it doesn't have to.

870
01:12:01,641 --> 01:12:03,160
It tells you what's crucial.

871
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:06,200
Virgil never gets the right answers.

872
01:12:06,201 --> 01:12:09,561
He only gets these ad hoc kind of answers.

873
01:12:09,561 --> 01:12:11,800
And now, one more, just in time.

874
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:18,280
And now, when I said I was going to say something too clever by half, maybe, is what I'm going to say now.

875
01:12:18,281 --> 01:12:19,720
I sort of jumped ahead.

876
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:22,920
What I think now is probably still okay.

877
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:30,720
But if you ask yourself now, where is Virgil sitting when he's explaining all of this?

878
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:35,441
And getting it sort of raw and getting only the ad hoc.

879
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:39,120
He's in Canto 11, Circle 6.

880
01:12:39,441 --> 01:12:41,920
And what is Canto 11, Circle 6?

881
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,641
It's the place where the heretics are punished.

882
01:12:44,641 --> 01:12:50,080
Heretics are people who get it wrong about Christianity.

883
01:12:50,641 --> 01:13:07,601
I think, but now I say, this might be overinterpreting, that Dante there is saying that Virgil's account of the meaning of the law has just not got the truth about Christianity.

884
01:13:07,601 --> 01:13:09,360
And he puts it all there.

885
01:13:09,361 --> 01:13:10,960
He doesn't say anything about it.

886
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,880
He just puts it within the circle of the heretics.

887
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,681
And I think, I don't know.

888
01:13:17,681 --> 01:13:19,760
I hope he does it on purpose.

889
01:13:20,401 --> 01:13:21,120
Now let's see.

890
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,561
I'm almost done.

891
01:13:23,521 --> 01:13:26,800
So the heretics involved are the Epicureans.

892
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,120
That's a philosophical sect.

893
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:34,400
We still talk about being Epicures and Epicurean.

894
01:13:34,401 --> 01:13:44,561
They believed that they wouldn't accept the idea that love could be total devotion.

895
01:13:44,561 --> 01:13:48,720
They would certainly think that that, they don't understand that at all.

896
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:55,920
So the Stoics think that what do the Epicureans, now I'm getting confused.

897
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,120
What do they do?

898
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:05,200
Okay, on page 100, the footnote says that the aim of philosophy is to achieve happiness, absence of pain.

899
01:14:05,201 --> 01:14:08,480
Doctrine thought it meant the denial of eternal life.

900
01:14:08,481 --> 01:14:09,880
No, I don't think that's important.

901
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:12,360
I don't know why I'm even saying it.

902
01:14:09,521 --> 01:14:13,240
So I'm going to skip it.

903
01:14:13,641 --> 01:14:22,200
The other thing, another one of the people in the heretics, let's try that, is Faronata, who's a Stoic.

904
01:14:22,201 --> 01:14:25,160
And Virgil is also a kind of Stoic.

905
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:29,720
They all think that self-control and temperance are the highest virtues.

906
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:35,880
And they think that trying to get bliss out of the world is a terrible mistake, like Guido made.

907
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:46,120
And so Virgil can't understand the shakeup, he can't understand the importance of love.

908
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:51,800
He can only think, I'm going to stop with this, that love is always a mess.

909
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:55,160
It causes Paul's guido to go crazy.

910
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:58,521
It gets Paula and Francesca into trouble.

911
01:14:58,521 --> 01:15:15,641
And there's a funny place where, page 112, Canto 12, circle 7, line about 40, he's describing what happens when Jesus comes down to hell to get out the Hebrews.

912
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,800
There's something like a big earthquake.

913
01:15:18,281 --> 01:15:19,561
And that's not important.

914
01:15:19,561 --> 01:15:21,960
What's important is what he says about it.

915
01:15:23,321 --> 01:15:34,120
He says, if I'm not mistaken, it was just before the coming of him who took the souls from limbo that all hell was shaken, so that I thought the universe felt love.

916
01:15:34,441 --> 01:15:42,120
Jesus is love, all right, and love is breaking in on 112, where three stanzas down.

917
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,200
So I thought the universe felt love.

918
01:15:44,201 --> 01:15:46,200
Now that you think, would be nice, wouldn't you?

919
01:15:46,201 --> 01:15:49,720
Everything attracted to everything and everything held together.

920
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:59,360
So that I thought the universe felt love and all its elements moved toward harmony, whereby the world of matter, as some believe, is often funged to chaos.

921
01:15:59,681 --> 01:16:01,920
And so, and that's it.

922
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:04,240
A very peculiar view of love.

923
01:16:05,281 --> 01:16:20,320
But a view that follows that whatever kind of love, agape love, eros, romantic love, it all only causes trouble according to the view that Virgil holds.

924
01:16:20,321 --> 01:16:23,601
Now I think I really have finished what I want to say.

925
01:16:23,601 --> 01:16:25,120
Just let me pass.

926
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
So I just want to say again, St.

927
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:39,521
Thomas understood the distinction between turning towards the wrong things, which is what happens outside this, and turning away from God's creation, which is what happens inside this.

928
01:16:39,521 --> 01:16:41,280
Virgil can't understand that.

929
01:16:41,281 --> 01:16:43,440
He doesn't know anything about that.

930
01:16:43,441 --> 01:16:49,200
And now we're ready to go on to the lower part of hell.

931
01:16:49,201 --> 01:16:53,760
And the next thing we want to read, next time I'm going to do two things.

932
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,641
Talk about Canto 26.

933
01:16:56,641 --> 01:17:09,120
Before we read Canto 26, which is interesting to us because Odyssey shows up in hell, pretty far down, in Canto 26.

934
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:16,800
And then, besides that, we're going to look at the bottom of hell, which is where Satan is.

935
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:27,601
And that is Cantos 32, 32 to 34.

936
01:17:28,241 --> 01:17:32,880
And we may get to purgatory.

937
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:36,400
And that would be Canto's Can you read what I'm writing?

938
01:17:36,401 --> 01:17:41,320
If not, I'll read it I'll find one, like four does it sixteen.

939
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:44,280
I tr I would hope to cover all of that next time.

940
01:17:44,521 --> 01:17:45,880
Can you see what I wrote?

941
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:47,240
Or should I read it?

942
01:17:47,561 --> 01:17:49,240
Can you can you see it?

943
01:17:49,241 --> 01:17:50,040
Oh, okay.

944
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:50,920
That's it then.
