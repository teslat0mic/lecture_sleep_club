00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
So, okay, now I'm going to start with a few, just quick remarks about last time, because there were loose ends last time.

2
00:00:08,399 --> 00:00:18,839
The funny, this one is very unimportant, but this palsied universe, which seems like palsy but must mean pale, isn't in the dictionary in my computer.

3
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:30,679
It seems to be a word that either, on page 189, it must be in, I take it a word that Melville either made up or has gone out of existence since 1850.

4
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:37,159
And I'm sure it means paled, and it's got to do just with another way of saying white.

5
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:58,200
But the other thing I wanted to say was that I realized, I don't think I said it, I think I just wrote it in the margin, that Homer, I'm thinking about Homer and Melville for a minute, that Homer likes light, and therefore he fears the ocean as dark and dangerous.

6
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,519
And Poseidon is Odysseus' enemy.

7
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:12,839
And whereas Melville likes the dark and the deep, he agrees that the ocean is dark and deep and dangerous, but he likes it for that reason.

8
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:30,839
That's a very important difference between a deep, deep difference, because I think it means that Homer really wants everything to be clear and representable and in the light and spelled out, and that Melville thinks that that's impossible.

9
00:01:30,839 --> 00:01:43,479
He sees that the background is what's most important in many ways, which we'll keep coming back to, is unrepresentable, undescribable, indefinite, and so forth.

10
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:47,880
And therefore, he thinks the ocean is the best place to be.

11
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,679
Yeah.

12
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:53,560
Melville, Homer would like the sky, of course.

13
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:59,359
It's where the light comes from, and that's all very clear and manifest and out in the open.

14
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:04,240
I don't can't think of Melville talking about the sky.

15
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,680
Of course, he talks about the rainbow.

16
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,959
We'll come back to that.

17
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,120
But that's different than the sky.

18
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,080
No, he does earth, he does see.

19
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,280
Keep your eyes open.

20
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:20,719
If you find him giving an interpretation of the sky, tell me about it.

21
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:27,519
Because it may be that there's so many interpretations of so many things going on that he will do it someplace, and I just missed it.

22
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:30,880
Or maybe I even knew it once but forgot it.

23
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,279
So just think about it.

24
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:49,440
Okay, so the other thing I wrote down was there were a quote that I don't remember that somebody mentioned to me, I think, after class, because otherwise I would have said it, that a place where he says that the whale is chaos at the bottom of 125.

25
00:02:49,440 --> 00:03:03,839
Remember, I was listing all the various ways the whale is indescribable, indeterminate, has no face, makes incomprehensible gestures with its tail and is covered with hieroglyphics that nobody could read.

26
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:13,760
And at about 10 lines from the bottom of 125, he says the classification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing here, nothing less is here as said.

27
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:23,520
That is, if you try to classify the whale, do a science of the whale, do cetology, which is whale science, you can't do it.

28
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:34,959
And that was the other thing I wanted to read because I think last time I got to the point where I wanted to say science can't get a grip on the whale, but I couldn't find the pages.

29
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,159
I don't know if that's familiar, but that's how I remember it.

30
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,479
So I found the pages.

31
00:03:39,479 --> 00:04:02,440
On 126 he talks about the field of whale studies is very very messed up and they can't even decide whether the whale is a fish or a mammal, because it's certainly sort of in one sense a mammal, but Melville says or Ishmael says for him it's a fish.

32
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:11,959
Anyway, and he says at the top of 126, all these incomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists.

33
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:13,159
That's not what he says.

34
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,959
He's quoting a naturalist who says that, a scientist.

35
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:25,720
The scientists who want to get clear about things are naturally going to be driven crazy by the indeterminateness of Moby Dick.

36
00:04:25,719 --> 00:04:29,160
And then I did, if I've read these, stop me.

37
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:38,520
On 127, the top paragraph, last sentence, and yet the sperm whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete in any literature.

38
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,440
Far above all other hunted whales, his is an unwritten life.

39
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,080
I don't think I ever read that or found that.

40
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:55,400
In the middle of 127, I promise nothing complete because any human thing supposed to be complete must for that very reason infallibly be faulty.

41
00:04:55,399 --> 00:05:00,520
That's a very, that's just halfway down almost exactly on 127.

42
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:16,600
And that's that's certainly that's that accounts for the crazy organization of all these higgly-piggly extracts at the beginning and all the stories that the completeness is totalizing, is getting the whole story.

43
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:19,639
It's what philosophers try, making the whole story clear.

44
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,560
That's what philosophers try to do.

45
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:41,280
Science tries to do, in on onto theology to, in Dante, anyway, tries to do, he finally gets a clear, upfront vision of the ultimate meaning of things when he sees God and how all the weeds of the universe are bound together in one clear unity.

46
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,640
And Melville thinks that's just impossible.

47
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,840
Reality doesn't add up to anything.

48
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,520
There is no complete story.

49
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,080
It's not that it's complete and we just can't know it.

50
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,400
It's a much more radical view.

51
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:01,680
There isn't any right answer at all, whether no one could know it, because there is nothing that it all adds up to.

52
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,200
It's chaos.

53
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,880
And all there are, finally, are interpretations.

54
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:11,600
That's the moral of today's lecture.

55
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:17,600
So now, having sort of caught up, I'm going on, onward.

56
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:24,159
So first, I'm going to review the whiteness chapter because that's so central.

57
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,640
Remember, he says that if you don't understand that chapter, you just don't understand the book.

58
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,640
So it won't hurt to go through it again because it's rather complicated.

59
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,880
So to begin with, it's complicated.

60
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:37,119
Well, color equals meaning.

61
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:39,360
That's sort of basic.

62
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:45,920
And whiteness equals, therefore, in a certain way, somehow, meaningless.

63
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,359
And I can't explain that exactly.

64
00:06:49,359 --> 00:07:04,000
I think that's sort of intuitive, that meanings are various colorations, and that something white would be something that you couldn't say anything about or get any grip on or make any picture of or anything.

65
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:06,479
So, but there are two kinds of whiteness.

66
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:13,320
That's the first re reason you might be confused, and I have to unconfuse you before it's too late.

67
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:18,040
So, nature is blank.

68
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:20,920
It's just white.

69
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:29,400
And science tells us that all colors and smells and feels and so forth are just subjective.

70
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:44,840
Out there, there's just a bunch of electrons and quarks and strings or whatever running around and bumping into each other, and that's meaningless and literally colorless.

71
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:53,320
And then we project onto it, onto this what's sometimes now called disenchanted nature.

72
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,320
I mean, nature was full of color for Homer, presumably.

73
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:12,840
I mean, they saw it as having living gods all over it and whooshing up and having pros and con views toward human beings and so forth.

74
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:26,360
But once you get Galileo and Newton and all of our modern science, nature becomes disenchanted, which is, I say, it's a word that an important guy named Weber uses, but we don't need to talk about that.

75
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:33,480
In Melville language, nature is real, we realize that nature is blank.

76
00:08:33,479 --> 00:09:03,200
And yet, it looks colorful to us, and that's because it fools us, and that's because it operates on our blank brains, blank meaning just neurons and meaningless things, and there's all this energy coming in, more blank, meaningless stuff, and when they get together, we see all this, color and people, and chairs and tables, but all that is just a cover-up.

77
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:21,520
Painting like a harlot for him means that this ugly pale woman has put on makeup and lipstick and jewelry and so forth, but that's all just to cover up the absolute minimalness, blankness of it.

78
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,320
Is that okay?

79
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,279
I mean, you should, that's not going to turn out to be important.

80
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:32,560
You just have to get that out of the way because that's not the kind of whiteness that interests him.

81
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,520
There's no answer to that kind of whiteness.

82
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,359
Nature just is like that for us right now.

83
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:54,720
There's this amazing passage where he considers that nature might get re-enchanted, and then it would be full of meaning and color again, like it was for the polytheist Greeks.

84
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:58,560
But for us now, it's disenchanted.

85
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,999
If I could turn to it, I would read it now.

86
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:07,600
I wasn't going to read this right now, but it seems so relevant.

87
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:09,600
Whereas maybe I can find it.

88
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:10,800
I doubt it.

89
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,280
If I don't find it in a minute, I won't try because I'm going to come back to it anyway.

90
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:23,040
But what's sort of striking is the way he hopes color would come back to nature, so to speak.

91
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,879
Anyway, right now, it's white.

92
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:29,360
Let's go on to the whiteness of Moby Dick.

93
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,560
The whiteness of Moby Dick isn't just a blank whiteness.

94
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,600
It's a whiteness, a blankness, as he puts it, full of meaning.

95
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,080
And that's where everything gets very interesting.

96
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,280
That's not nature that's a blankness full of meaning.

97
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,880
That's something like reality is a dumb blankness full of meaning.

98
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,680
Or no, that's not even quite right.

99
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:56,840
Whiteness.

100
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:05,560
If reality is understood as whiteness, then reality is understood as a dumb blankness full of meaning.

101
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:14,359
That is, and that's the funny thing that's so deep and strange, and Melville doesn't sort of emphasize it very much.

102
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:29,320
Either it's so obvious to him that he doesn't need to say it, or I think it's probably something that he intuits so sort of directly and practically and physically that he doesn't even know he's saying it.

103
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:36,599
But the dumb blankness full of meaning is the whiteness which you get when you put the rainbow together.

104
00:11:36,599 --> 00:11:45,639
Remember, what you see in the white, in the spout of white Moby Dick is a rainbow.

105
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:50,519
And that means that there is a lot of color in reality.

106
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:56,599
If you could only get attuned to it, resonate to it, and see it.

107
00:11:56,599 --> 00:12:03,959
And it's only by when you try to add up all these colors that you get whiteness.

108
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:16,439
Or you glom onto one of the colors and then you get this kind of unified color, but that's not you you miss with a really colorful, meaningfulness of reality.

109
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:25,080
And in order to not see the blankness, remember, of the whiteness of the snow, for instance, people wear colored glasses.

110
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:32,560
That means people interpret it under one under one description or one color or another.

111
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:37,680
And that's monotheism.

112
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:46,080
That leads to having one unified, overall interpretation that there's only one meaning.

113
00:12:46,399 --> 00:13:06,159
And Melville is a polytheist in the sense that he thinks there's all these multiple meanings, which you can, if you don't try to add up all the colors and don't get fixed on one of the colors, you can see the rainbow.

114
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:25,040
And that means, I have to keep repeating it because it's all so interesting and strange, that means to see the rainbow is to have a kind of sensitivity to the moods of all sorts of different situations and to have intuitions about all sorts of different situations.

115
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,719
And Melville says explicitly that's what he's got.

116
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:41,199
That's, I mean, I would think that I made up this sort of story if it wasn't that for several moments he tells you explicitly what he's up to on 362.

117
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,599
I read this last time, but it's so important that I'm going to read it again.

118
00:13:46,560 --> 00:14:04,240
And what's hardly amazing to me always is he tells you these extremely important things just on the same level and with the same sort of virtuosity and sort of over overkill language, then he tells you everything else.

119
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,040
It's been the middle of 362.

120
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:14,599
And now we go back to the to the rainbow and how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster.

121
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,879
Did you ever notice that he's just mad for alliteration?

122
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:25,399
I don't know if that tells us anything deep about Melville, but I notice it more every time I read it.

123
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,240
And here's just another example.

124
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,279
You know what alliteration is?

125
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,119
It all sounds with M's here.

126
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:53,399
The conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to behold him solemnly sailing, more alliteration, through a calm tropical sea, his vast, vile head overhung by a canopy of vapor engendered by his incommunicable contemplations, and that vapor, as you will sometimes see it, glorified by a rainbow, as if heaven itself had put a seal upon his thoughts.

127
00:14:53,399 --> 00:15:16,439
Now, wait a minute, before, lest you think that then that it is that I made up the connection between the rainbow and this polytheistic sensitivity to all the different moods that you could have, like all the different gods, remember, moods of erotic moods and aggressive moods and domestic moods and parsimony mood.

128
00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:18,039
I don't have a word for that.

129
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,560
Anyway, so for he says, for do you see rainbows do not visit the clear air.

130
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,919
They only irradiate vapor.

131
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,200
That doesn't happen.

132
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:27,239
And now we go on.

133
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:35,800
And so through all the thickness of the dim doubts in my mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray.

134
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,080
And for this I thank God, for all have doubts.

135
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,200
Many deny.

136
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:41,480
The doubts are denials.

137
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,679
Few of them have intuitions.

138
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:49,399
Doubts of all things earthly and intuitions of some things heavenly.

139
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:55,080
This combination makes neither a believer nor an infidel, but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye.

140
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:05,359
That is, he's not a believer, a Dante kind of onto theologist, and he's not an infidel that is a disbeliever, an atheist.

141
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:13,839
He's got his own sensitivity to the rainbow.

142
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:20,560
And you'll see it in another way in a minute, and you'll see it in another way next time, next Tuesday.

143
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,560
I'll be talking about some of the different moods he gets into.

144
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:35,359
The moods of Ishmael, there is a whole bunch of them, and he goes into each of them full blast, and really it colors his whole world for a while.

145
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:40,000
Then he gets into a different mood, and that colors a different mood for a while.

146
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:47,919
On the paper topics, Dave, didn't I quote something from a letter to at the bottom of the top, the old paper topics that I have in there?

147
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:52,560
I think I quoted something which I'd like to quote again now from a letter, right?

148
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,959
Yeah, can I see that?

149
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,720
Because there's a place where he says to Hawthorne, but I've just forgotten it.

150
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:02,639
Okay, thanks.

151
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:03,599
Yeah.

152
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:09,760
So this kind of polytheistic thing again, he says, I read this part.

153
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,640
I would sit down and dine with you and all the gods in old Rome's pantheon.

154
00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:15,999
But I didn't read this.

155
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,800
I feel that the Godhead is broken up like the bread at supper and that we are the pieces.

156
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,560
Again, it's no unified view.

157
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,239
Then he says, this is a long letter, but you are not bound to answer it.

158
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,439
This is the new part.

159
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:34,800
Possibly, if you do answer it and direct it to Herman Melville, you will missend it.

160
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:43,239
For the very fingers that now guide this pen, as Melville writes his letter, are not precisely the same that took it up and put it on this paper.

161
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,919
Lord, when shall we be done changing?

162
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:50,679
So, I mean, that's the changeable moodiness of him.

163
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:53,480
There's no one Melville.

164
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,479
And when he's under the influence of Ahab, he thinks like Ahab.

165
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,999
And when he's under the influence of other things, he feels and senses like they do.

166
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,040
Here, thanks.

167
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,640
But now we're going on.

168
00:18:05,639 --> 00:18:08,679
That was still getting up to where we were last time.

169
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:10,999
I just want to catch up with myself.

170
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
So you don't find meaning in nature.

171
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,399
There isn't any now anyway.

172
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:17,080
And not in Revelation.

173
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:22,359
He's very suspicious of Revelation because it looks like that's supposed to be the true answer.

174
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:26,119
But you get in tune with all the manifestations of the sacred.

175
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:28,999
Each one is worth cultivating in its own right.

176
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:46,839
So getting in sync with as many various moods, various divine intuitions, as he calls them, as possible is what you should be doing once you understood the reality, namely what Moby Dick's whiteness means.

177
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:56,040
You would want to get a whole spectrum of meanings, a rainbow of colors, which only looks white if you try mistakenly to add them all up.

178
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,119
I want to say a word about the mistaken people who try to add them all up.

179
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:04,759
I don't see anybody in the book who is like that.

180
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,599
But we've got them around us more now.

181
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:15,720
If you see anybody who is trying to add all the colors to have one unified view in the book, let me know.

182
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:22,119
As I say, the book is so rich, having read it a few times doesn't mean that I in any way got a grip on it.

183
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:30,800
But the people who try to add it all up are people who say, Well, all religions are really about the same thing.

184
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,320
We're all climbing the same mountain just from various sides.

185
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:40,240
I think Houston Smith says that in his famous book in the religions of the world or whatever.

186
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,680
You know, Houston Smith's book that everybody reads and pays attention to.

187
00:19:45,679 --> 00:20:08,560
Anyway, and in a way, I think Joseph Campbell thinks that, and the Jungians think that, and there are all these people who think that every, there is this seeming variety of religions around, all over the world, weird, complicated, different, primitive, and all that, but they're really all getting at the same thing.

188
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,399
They're all getting at the same truth.

189
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:16,080
That's the great discovery of the West, in a way.

190
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,320
That's onto theology.

191
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,919
And one of its versions.

192
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,359
And very famous people.

193
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:32,000
So there's somebody I almost want to sort of reschedule class to go here a week from Thursday.

194
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,159
I haven't made up my mind what to do about that.

195
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:43,679
Robert Bella, who was a very famous sociologist who gave the sociology of religion here for many, many years.

196
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,959
He's now retired, but he's going to talk about, in effect, multiple worlds.

197
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:57,760
And I know from having talked to Bella over the years, and he's an authority, particularly on Japanese religion, which is as polytheistic as you can get.

198
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,800
He hates it.

199
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,159
He's an authority on it, but he thinks that there's one unified answer.

200
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:19,560
There's something called the Axial Age, which is supposed to have happened, what, about 300 BC, when Buddhism, Christianity, Jehovah, the Creator God, all gave out their unifying pronouncements.

201
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:29,080
And people like Bella think that there is one truth and that these people, these different religions, all saw that same deep insight.

202
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,960
There's one truth.

203
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,519
They describe it differently, but the important insight is the unity of it.

204
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,639
That's the view Melville is against.

205
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:56,839
And the other person who thinks that you may hear about, or maybe you heard about it, if you happen to listen to the news, Charles Taylor, who just got a prize of one and a half million dollars for having a spiritual approach to sociology.

206
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:05,080
I think Charles Taylor is a wonderful person and a wonderful philosopher, but on this deep issue, we differ.

207
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,920
I mean, he, like Bella, thinks that the great news is the axial age.

208
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:19,399
And if you're a polytheist, like I am, sort of, you think that that was a big disaster, that they lost everything when they thought that there was one unified understanding of everything.

209
00:22:19,399 --> 00:22:21,080
At least that's Melville's view.

210
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,800
And when I'm teaching Melville, I believe Melville.

211
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,959
When I teach Kierkegaard, I believe Kierkegaard.

212
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,199
That only shows that I'm really a polytheist at heart, anyway, I think.

213
00:22:30,199 --> 00:22:33,560
Okay, so much for that.

214
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:40,999
We're ready to go on now to the question: where does this rainbow of meanings come from?

215
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:51,400
If there isn't some unified God behind it that produced it all, created it, or maybe it's been there all along, like for Buddhism.

216
00:22:51,399 --> 00:23:01,199
But if there isn't some unifying principle in that case, like karma behind it all, then you wouldn't, then why is there all this?

217
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:09,040
What's a kind of creation story when you don't believe in a creator?

218
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:14,800
But you've got all this stuff around and you want to know sort of why is it there?

219
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,119
Well, he's got an answer to that.

220
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:20,159
And it's a very strange and interesting answer.

221
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:33,519
And it comes, and it's my, it's what convinces me that the rainbow story and the whiteness story are central to the book.

222
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,879
Because if that's all I had to go on, I'd be suspicious.

223
00:23:36,879 --> 00:23:47,599
If I were you, you should be suspicious of all these pages, what, 600 and something, that he comes up so infrequently talking about the whiteness and the rainbow.

224
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:52,959
Whenever he does, he says it's crucial, like he just said in the thing about divine intuitions.

225
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:56,720
So here's another variation, and it's a funny one.

226
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,320
It's on 432.

227
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,560
It's in chapter 102.

228
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,639
If it had anything to do with the plot and the characters, I wouldn't read it, but it doesn't.

229
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:12,639
It's sheer Melville, I would say Melville metaphysics, but of course he would hate metaphysics because that's unifying philosophy.

230
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,399
But it's sheer Melville whatever.

231
00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:18,080
I don't know what to even call it.

232
00:24:18,879 --> 00:24:24,719
It's his understanding of the basic way things get the way they are.

233
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,239
Okay, and now, and what is it that he discovered?

234
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,839
What does he describe when he wants to describe that?

235
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:41,080
Well, it's amazing because what he describes in a variation which is pretty so incredible that he would come up with it.

236
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:52,359
We've been hearing about Moby Dick in the ocean, how you can't understand what he looks like when he's swimming around, and you can't when you fish him out because he's all limp and woggly then.

237
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:55,800
And so, then, but what about this?

238
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,999
The skeleton of the whale on the land.

239
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:07,240
That's what he takes up in this peculiar chapter, which is called A Bower in the Arsaka Caiades.

240
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,720
I can't pronounce it, so I won't try anymore.

241
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,759
So, in 434, he's telling about what he found there.

242
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,399
There was a, and he, the things that he sees, what is chief among these?

243
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:28,520
Lots of wonderful things there were, and that they chief among the things they collected was a great sperm whale.

244
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:42,999
These are strange primitive people, which, after an unusual, long, raging gale, had been found dead and stranded with his head against a coconut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted dropings seemed his verdant jet.

245
00:25:43,000 --> 00:26:03,399
When the last body had at last been stripped of its fathom-deep enfoldings, and the bones became dusty and dry in the sun, then the skeleton was carefully transposed up the Pupella Glen, that's the name of this place, where a grand temple of lordly palms now shelters it.

246
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:07,479
So now it's a kind of god in a temple of palms.

247
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,800
And that's a new version.

248
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:17,080
It's another version of the rainbow of meanings, but you won't see it right away.

249
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,719
But I think I can convince you.

250
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:37,040
And so there we are, it's a kind of temple, and now the ribs were hung with trophies, the vertebrae carved with animals of that country that I can't pronounce, in strange hieroglyphics.

251
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,119
And that's the name.

252
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,519
I'm just reading on 434.

253
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:51,920
The vertebrae were so-and-so in the in the skull, the priest kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame so that the mystic head sent forth its vapory spout.

254
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:59,759
That's the same vapory spout that has the rainbow in it, but it's not in it now because it's a different angle we're going to get.

255
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,719
And it was a wondrous sight.

256
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,200
And now comes something that's important, but you never know it.

257
00:27:07,199 --> 00:27:10,800
The wood was green as mosses of the icy glen.

258
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:16,080
The trees stood high in half feeling their living sap.

259
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:26,639
The industrious earth beneath was as a weaver's loom with a gorgeous carpet on it, whereof the ground trend drills formed the warp and woof.

260
00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:28,959
Keep your eye out for weavers.

261
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:36,720
The weaver metaphor is his deepest sense of reality.

262
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:49,839
He does it another time, which I'm not going to talk about, where he gives you the warp and warp, warp and woof of the way you make a carpet with vertical and cross threads as a description of free will and determinism.

263
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:51,839
I don't think that's very interesting.

264
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:58,800
But what's very interesting is what happens to the weaver story, the loon story here.

265
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,640
And why you know it's important is because it's about God.

266
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:10,280
It turns out, insofar as there's a God, and there isn't really, of course, God is a weaver.

267
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:16,440
And that is the ultimate principle behind it all is weaving.

268
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:18,520
A very peculiar idea.

269
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:21,080
You think somebody lost their mind.

270
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:33,560
But about 15 lines from the bottom of 434, the weaver God he weaves, and now comes a new thing, and by that weaving he is deafened, and he hears no mortal voice.

271
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:39,080
And by that humming, we too who look at the womb, the loom, are deafened.

272
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:46,919
And only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it.

273
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:49,880
Does anybody see what's happening there?

274
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,800
Do you see the relation of this to the whiteness of the whale?

275
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:57,879
It took me ages to see it, but it's staring you in the face.

276
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,800
Suppose I give you a clue.

277
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:03,160
You've heard something called white noise.

278
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:04,680
Well, that's what this is about.

279
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:07,080
It's about the whiteness of the noise.

280
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:17,240
What happens is that if the weaving, which is the way the world works, so to speak, I'll talk more about the weaving in a minute, makes a lot of noise.

281
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:21,799
It's like putting out a lot of colors, and we're deafened by it.

282
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:22,679
What does that mean?

283
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:25,639
Well, that's like being blinded by the whiteness.

284
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:34,440
You can't hear the many different voices unless you get a certain distance from it.

285
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,720
And then it turns out it isn't white noise at all.

286
00:29:37,719 --> 00:29:40,599
It's a spectrum of voices.

287
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:51,480
In other words, it's the rainbow story told in sound instead of in light, and told on the land instead of on the water.

288
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,639
I don't think there's any interesting correlation between why, water, why, land.

289
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:05,279
But what it is interesting is he's got this variation that keeps the same structure as the whiteness story.

290
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,920
Let me see.

291
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,719
So it's like a mystic head.

292
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,159
It's got 434.

293
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,040
I am here.

294
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:20,000
Okay, there's the mystic head, the vapor, the weaving, the humming.

295
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,239
I think I've got to where I want to be.

296
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,319
So keep your eye out.

297
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:26,160
This is just a note to me.

298
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,399
We'll get there by the end of today, I think, for another time when you see God as the weaver.

299
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,440
What does it mean to say you see God as a weaver?

300
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:42,799
Well, I must admit, I would have no clue if it weren't that Heidegger is in the back of my mind, as you know every once in a while.

301
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:55,440
Heidegger has this peculiar idea that the basic, this thing that accounts for all the meaning and color and order and so forth, is what he calls gathering.

302
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:14,639
He says that logos, which is this word that John has for the structure, this Greek word for the structure of everything, is really legame in its original form, which means the way seeds of wheat are bound together.

303
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:26,480
But what Heidegger makes out of it is that gathering is the ultimate way the world is, if you could say created, created.

304
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,439
The way the world works.

305
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,000
How about that?

306
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,080
The way the world works is by gathering.

307
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,000
But now, what does that mean?

308
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Well, and by the way, he has another word for it.

309
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,440
Now, I shouldn't even tell you, but I will.

310
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:40,360
It's because it's a German word that nobody understands how to translate.

311
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,279
So it doesn't help much to tell you.

312
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,720
Erignis.

313
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:47,159
But the idea that Melville is so close to Heidegger just amazes me.

314
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:55,000
Eragnis means, as best anybody can translate it, things coming into their own by belonging together.

315
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,199
And that's a mouthful.

316
00:31:56,199 --> 00:32:16,360
But here's what the idea is that sounds so puzzling and bizarre: is that it's our practices, remember, our many ways of behaving, of talking, of standing, of eating, of fishing and cooking, but also building and maybe having lectures.

317
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,839
All these practices that we have.

318
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:25,080
We have them because our practices tend to get organized.

319
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,520
That's the gathering.

320
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:36,599
So the fishing practices gather more and more fishing practices, and the eating practices go from very crude to being like French eating practices, very complicated.

321
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:44,280
And teaching certainly went from just people teaching their children to the gurus teaching to professors teaching.

322
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:48,040
And all those are ways that the teaching practices gather.

323
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:57,639
That's, I take it, unless Melville is just raving, is what he sort of senses when he thinks that there's a weaver God.

324
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:01,400
And that's already pretty amazing.

325
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:05,080
And then he adds this other thing, which is really not Heideggerian.

326
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:16,280
It's just sheer Melvillian, that the weaving makes a lot of noise, and the noise is a white noise, and thereby wipes out all meaning.

327
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:35,599
But if you get far enough away from the weaving, that is, get a kind of open, detached, but ready-to-be drawn in by it, the Ishmael sensitivity to the divine intuitions, you can hear thousands of voices in the white noise.

328
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:37,279
That really isn't white noise.

329
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,280
It's really full of meaning.

330
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:44,480
So it's the white noise of the weaving is a dumb blankness full of meaning again.

331
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,000
It's amazing that he pulls this off in two different registers like that.

332
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,919
So he must care about it, whether he really understands it.

333
00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:02,320
I love to say, Herman, I mean, did you know what you were doing when you put in this chapter on the skeleton and the weaver and the noise?

334
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:04,799
I don't know, but it's the way he thinks about it.

335
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,560
There's no doubt about it.

336
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,240
So the blankness is what you get when you try to make a total picture, remember.

337
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,199
Then you get a kind of noise and you can't hear anything.

338
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,439
That's what he's saying.

339
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:40,800
But if you the spoken words that are inaudible, I'm at the bottom of 434 now, among the flying spindles, that is the noisy stuff that's doing the weaving, those same words are plainly heard without the walls, that is outside the walls of the weaving factory, bursting from the opening casements, and so forth.

340
00:34:41,759 --> 00:34:51,439
Ah, mortal, then, be heedful, for so in all this din of the great world's loom, the subtlest things may be overheard afar.

341
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,040
That's his view.

342
00:34:53,279 --> 00:34:54,960
That's the way the world works.

343
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:04,960
It's a loom, and you have to get in the right relation to it to hear what's going on, and not just this noise.

344
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:26,760
And that's then if you get in the right relation, you see the polytheistic multiplicity of meanings, and in this case, voices, in the other one, colors, that's available to you if you don't try to sum them all up, if you don't get too close, if you don't get right inside the whale.

345
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:29,000
Let's see.

346
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,040
And for an hour, I gotta go at the bottom.

347
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:43,159
Now, amid the green, lithe, restless loom of that something, are the Arcadian, I'm gonna say wood, and the great white worship skeleton.

348
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:45,080
So the skeleton's white too, naturally.

349
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:54,439
The noise is white, and the Moby Dick is white, and the skeleton is white, all because they're a dumb, some they're all dumb blankness full of meaning.

350
00:35:55,080 --> 00:36:06,200
Yet, as the ever-woven, bourbon, wharf, verdant wharf, and woof intermixed and hung around him, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver.

351
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:20,599
That is, the skeleton of Moby Dick is worshipped as a kind of paradigm or instance or something, symbol, I don't know how to write to put it, of the weaver God.

352
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:25,160
And that's that's the amazing move he pulls here.

353
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:30,119
Let me see if I want to s and you need, I think, a kind of calm openness.

354
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:41,000
That's the sort of distance not to be pulled in too much by some kind of intense involvement if you're going to be able to hear all these voices.

355
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,639
I I'm not clear about that.

356
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:46,999
But um and now, so much for that.

357
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:48,759
Does anybody have something to say about that?

358
00:36:48,759 --> 00:36:49,000
Good.

359
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,839
You'll him then you.

360
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,800
Go ahead.

361
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,159
Yeah?

362
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:57,839
Interesting.

363
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:59,599
I think that's very interesting.

364
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:04,000
I have to think about it and I have to say it so people on the podcast can hear it.

365
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:13,840
So he says that he asked the important question, which I never asked myself, but I see that it's a sensible question.

366
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:28,960
What does Melville mean in this kind of extended metaphor or simile about the weaver and the skeleton to say that as you get further away, you can hear the multiple voices.

367
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:47,040
And it could be that the people who are right up close to the whale and the weaving don't hear it because they're but it's just sort of taken for granted and becomes the background white noise for them.

368
00:37:47,040 --> 00:38:05,839
But if you travel around like Ishmael and visit all these various cultures like this one and then you have a certain distance and you're not in the noise, then each of these cultures you visit will be like a different voice and you will be able to respond to thousands of them.

369
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,440
That's what you're saying.

370
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,200
Well that's an interesting thing to say.

371
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:14,080
I mean I think I think it's you need some kind of story, although you don't want to push it too far.

372
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:19,200
I mean his metaphor might just break down before we get to the point he's making.

373
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:21,520
But it's Kevin's there right.

374
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,119
Kevin's making.

375
00:38:24,319 --> 00:38:40,080
But if you have to make a sense of this distance thing, you might as well bring it around to the sense that Ishmael has, and Melville has, that you don't lose something when you visit strange cultures.

376
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:49,560
You are able to see and hear and respond to a sense of the sacred that the people who are in the culture are so close to they can't see it.

377
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,320
Well, I think that's interesting.

378
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:53,480
Okay, Dave, your turn.

379
00:38:54,759 --> 00:39:01,960
I feel a little worried about whether it's not your meaning of void.

380
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:07,399
The dumb blankness full of meaning these.

381
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,719
Why would you better fire us?

382
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:17,639
Okay, there's a good meaning.

383
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,839
No center, no one meaning.

384
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,719
No real void of meaning.

385
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:24,199
That's right.

386
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,359
I see everything is.

387
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:38,119
Well, I think it makes sense to be worried about it, that somehow I'm getting rid of the real horror, the kind of total, final, groundless void.

388
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,839
Well, I'm putting together my case.

389
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,080
I mean, of course, that goes with being a polytheist.

390
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,599
It goes with thinking that there's color everywhere, even in nature.

391
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:48,599
I mean, we just don't see it.

392
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:52,679
And it only looks, I mean, I'm just repeating my view, and you're repeating your worry.

393
00:39:52,679 --> 00:40:03,399
I mean, I mean, my view is it only looks like a blankness and a void to somebody like Ahab who wants it to be completely determinate and settled.

394
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,240
Then it looks groundless.

395
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:20,199
And it's a kind of, I think Melville thinks, I think Heidegger thinks, that it's a kind of metaphysical impulse of wanting a kind of meaning that we can't have, namely an answer that settles things, that tells us really what it all means.

396
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:22,680
I mean, Dante is my model of it.

397
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:33,440
You finally get the vision in which every single detail of the universe has its place and makes sense in one unified book that God has created, He's written.

398
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,359
But I mean, that's just the extreme version.

399
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:48,240
I mean, every metaphysics, every philosopher of the old-fashioned sort thought that they had some solid, coherent meaning story to tell.

400
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:53,599
And if you think that you need that, then it looks blank and hopeless because you can't have that.

401
00:40:53,599 --> 00:41:01,440
It's bottomless, the ocean and the whiteness blank from that perspective, the perspective that wants an answer.

402
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:30,080
But I really do think, and I'm more sort of driven than ever now, to find, if I read you a passage that said that the old gods could come back and the now unhaunted hill could be re-colored, so to speak, it would, I mean, I'm trying to argue that Melville doesn't think that there is a void.

403
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,960
Yeah, I'll just sum up what I think, but I can't find that passage.

404
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,159
But anyway, I'll find it probably today.

405
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:47,119
But anyway, I think Melville is not the kind of atheist who thinks that ultimately behind it all, there's nothing.

406
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:49,040
There's a kind of void.

407
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:54,080
That he thinks is a result of looking for the wrong sort of something.

408
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:01,599
And there is, and if you're looking for this positive meaning that's settled and won, you're not going to find it.

409
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,800
It's empty.

410
00:42:02,799 --> 00:42:09,200
But what you do find, oh, we've got to go on, because I'm going to give you my next argument.

411
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:16,040
I mean, the question is, what if you actually saw God's weaving going on?

412
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,719
And would that help convince you?

413
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:25,960
And what if it turned out when God is weaving, he's weaving a whole sort of random carpet of all sorts of colors?

414
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,119
That would be important.

415
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:34,200
I mean, that would, I mean, it would suggest that if you got to the bottom of it, well, let me do it.

416
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,959
That's the next issue.

417
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,040
You're perfectly right on.

418
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:53,639
We've got to understand, I mean, in my way of putting it, sort of how much of a very, very modern kind of nihilist could you read Nelville as being, that there really isn't any meaning at all at the bottom of everything.

419
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:57,880
And that's what I think you shouldn't do.

420
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,760
And maybe I'm framing you in a wrong way.

421
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:03,239
But good.

422
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:03,799
I like that.

423
00:43:03,799 --> 00:43:17,959
Yes, I mean, since he's always qualifying everything he says, and since he's capable of every possible mood, I think he certainly wants to say he's also capable of the mood, though I don't believe he ever tells you that he's in it in the book.

424
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,639
Okay, here's a new challenge.

425
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,000
Here's this rich book.

426
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:30,279
Does he ever get in, actually put himself, be in a situation, not sort of describing whiteness, but when he's describing Ishmael's goings on?

427
00:43:30,279 --> 00:43:33,239
Ishmael gets into an intense relation to Ahab.

428
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:43,159
He gets in a tense relation to his fellow sailors and describes that in the very important chapter called The Squeezing of the Sperm, which we have to talk about next time, maybe.

429
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:48,760
And he gets in a very intense relation to Kuique, of course.

430
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:57,840
And anyway, the question is: do we actually see him confronting the experience of the meaninglessness of everything?

431
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:03,920
I mean, he does describe the whiteness as having that terrifying aspect.

432
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:16,240
But my hunch is he's never, of all the divine intuitions he has, he never has, and he even has demonic intuitions when he gets in line with Ahab.

433
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:21,519
But I don't think he ever has the, it's altogether meaningless intuition.

434
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,320
I don't know.

435
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:28,480
I see, well, I'm going to, I have to pile in enough stuff to try to counteract that, or else you could have that.

436
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:39,839
I mean, we can always reach a reconciliation that that's one possible perspective, because I'm being very stubborn in saying that it's not even a possible perspective from Ishmael's point of view.

437
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,040
It's a mistake.

438
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,280
And now that's what we have to decide.

439
00:44:43,279 --> 00:44:44,799
Okay, but anyway, here we go.

440
00:44:44,799 --> 00:44:46,639
We're going to talk about Pip now.

441
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:54,479
Pip is the black boy who is a kind of, I don't know what the word is.

442
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,919
I don't think we're ever told what he is.

443
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:02,560
He's like, in the movie business, a gopher, somebody who goes for things and gets them for people and so forth.

444
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,839
He just runs errands, as far as I can tell.

445
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:12,000
Pip is a normal, sensitive person, we're told.

446
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:21,359
And so his experience of the ultimate reality of things is going to turn out to be extremely important.

447
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,799
And we just have half an hour.

448
00:45:22,799 --> 00:45:24,159
We can probably do it.

449
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:39,759
So in 399, first we're just set up for Pitt being just a nice little black boy from, and at the top of about 10 lines down, I write that this little black, where are we?

450
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,400
Was brilliant.

451
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,959
For his blackness has its brilliancy.

452
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,799
For even blackness has its brilliancy.

453
00:45:45,799 --> 00:45:50,040
Behold, the lustrous ebony paralleled in king's cabinets.

454
00:45:50,279 --> 00:46:03,319
But Pip loved life and all life's peaceable securities, so that the panic-striking business in which he was somehow unaccountably becoming trapped had most sadly blurred his brightness.

455
00:46:03,319 --> 00:46:10,599
That is, he likes to be comfortable and secure, and out on the ocean is not a place to be comfortable and secure.

456
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:16,360
And even worse, in a whale boat, which is where we're going to find him, chasing a whale.

457
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,560
It's very uncomfortable and insecure.

458
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:24,599
And therefore, when he's out in the whaleboat chasing a whale, he jumps out.

459
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:26,920
This is the bottom of 400.

460
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,119
But we are all in the hands of the gods.

461
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:31,240
Isn't that interesting?

462
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:33,960
He's writing God's plural with a capital G.

463
00:46:34,279 --> 00:46:38,199
I suppose that's that, I don't know what he's doing there.

464
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,440
We are all in the hands of the gods, and Pip jumped again.

465
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:49,399
It was under very similar circumstances to the first performance, but this time he did not breast out the line.

466
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,480
I forget what that means.

467
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:59,159
And hence, when the whale started to run, Pip was left behind on the sea like a hurried traveler's trunk.

468
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:04,599
I guess he didn't get hold of the line so that he would go along with the boat.

469
00:47:04,599 --> 00:47:13,960
And then, the 12 lines down on 401, roughly, no boat knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern.

470
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:24,599
Stubbs, that's another one of the sailors, inexorable back was turned, inexorable back was turned upon him, and the whale, and the whale was winged.

471
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:26,719
That is, woo, very fast.

472
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:30,879
In three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and Stubbs.

473
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:40,000
Out from the center of the sea, poor Bip turned his crisp, curly, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway through the loftiest and the brightest.

474
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,599
Well, Pip is now lost in the gigantic ocean.

475
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:44,799
But I just want to comment.

476
00:47:44,799 --> 00:47:46,639
Melville is so consistent.

477
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:53,919
So Pip has an interpretation of the sun from his point of view as a fellow, lost, castaway.

478
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:57,519
And in a certain way, I don't know if Melville is thinking about this.

479
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:02,319
The sun is just another star lost in the millions of stars in the universe.

480
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,960
It's not the center anymore.

481
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,279
So, but Pip, I don't think, knows that.

482
00:48:07,279 --> 00:48:11,360
Pip just reads his own situation into the sun.

483
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:19,920
And now in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the practiced swimmer as to ride in the spring carriage ashore.

484
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,399
But the awful loneliness is intolerable.

485
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:24,080
This is what happens to Pip.

486
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:29,920
The intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity, my God, who can tell it.

487
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,680
So what happens to Pip?

488
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:36,080
He goes crazy at the bottom, about ten lines from the bottom.

489
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:41,280
Pip's ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably.

490
00:48:41,279 --> 00:48:43,119
And then he gets rescued.

491
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:48,160
But from that hour, the little negro went about the deck an idiot.

492
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:50,879
Such at last they said he was.

493
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,960
That is, he went crazy.

494
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:59,280
The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul.

495
00:48:59,279 --> 00:49:01,599
Not drowned entirely, though.

496
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:03,360
And now comes the interesting part.

497
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:20,680
Rather, carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes, the miser, and the miser Merman, whatever that is, wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps.

498
00:49:20,679 --> 00:49:26,279
And among the joyless, heartless, ever-juvenile eternity, Pip saw the multitudinous.

499
00:49:26,279 --> 00:49:31,960
And now comes, now Pip gets to have a vision of the ultimate basis of everything.

500
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:40,360
Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent coral insects that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs.

501
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:45,639
He saw God's foot upon the treadle of the loom, believe it or not, and spoke it.

502
00:49:45,639 --> 00:49:48,599
And therefore his shipmates called him mad.

503
00:49:49,719 --> 00:49:51,879
I would finish the paragraph before I start talking about it.

504
00:49:51,880 --> 00:50:08,679
So man's intense insanity is heaven sense, and wandering from all mortal reason, man comes at last to that celestial thought which to reason is absurd and frantic, and wheel and woe, woe, feels then uncompromised, indifferent as is God, as usual.

505
00:50:08,679 --> 00:50:11,159
God is indifferent, indeterminate, and so forth.

506
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:16,360
The crucial thing is what he saw when he saw God's foot upon the loom.

507
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:32,520
Well, he saw again that gathering was what the ultimate principle that accounts for the order in the practices, that accounts for the various cultures, that that accounts for the way things show up, and that accounts for what it makes sense to do.

508
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:37,800
He saw all that Heideggerian stuff, but now he saw also the coral insects.

509
00:50:37,799 --> 00:50:53,879
I've got to tell you a story about that because it's my lifelong tribute to some person who, when I gave this course two times ago, there was a middle-aged engineer who was either, I don't know where he was taking it or auditing it.

510
00:50:53,880 --> 00:51:07,440
He sat in the front row with his feet up on one of the seats and constantly made comments without even raising his hand, which were usually absolutely hopeless, not stupid, but just facts.

511
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,080
And here we were in this high level of abstraction.

512
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:15,999
He was telling me, I don't know, Melville was born on a certain day or that he got married and had how many children.

513
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:26,720
But when I got to this thing that I never understood the coral insects, he spoke up and said, it's the many colors of the rainbow again.

514
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:28,319
And he's absolutely right.

515
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:29,199
I was stunned.

516
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:32,080
I mean, I've been telling my TAs, they kept saying, shut him up.

517
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:35,040
And I kept saying, no, one day he's going to say something interesting.

518
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,880
And he did.

519
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,599
And because I couldn't understand what are these coral insects doing?

520
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:47,760
Well, they're sort of randomly making the beautiful colored coral, which is like the rainbow.

521
00:51:47,759 --> 00:51:53,040
And or like the music of all, well, no, never mind.

522
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,319
It's like the rainbow.

523
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:55,599
Stick to the rainbow.

524
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:58,400
So he sees, where is it now?

525
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:08,240
The colossal, out of the coral insects, you get all of the heavenly bodies and the world and culture and everything.

526
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:13,119
God weaves all that color together.

527
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:17,679
And that's the bottom line, literally at the bottom of the ocean.

528
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:20,080
That's what Pip understands.

529
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:23,279
I want to say one more thing, and I forgot it as I was talking just to.

530
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,319
Oh, yeah.

531
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:27,680
And that it's all contingent and random.

532
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:41,319
I mean, it's not as if there's a unified something behind all those coral insects who are just crawling around, every one of them at random, or God's foot on the treadmill, on the treadle of the loom, just weaving anything to anything.

533
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:47,799
It's all random, and yet it adds up to the spectrum of the colors or to the color of the coral.

534
00:52:47,799 --> 00:52:51,880
I think that's Melville's intuition.

535
00:52:51,880 --> 00:53:03,080
And Pip is a genius for having seen it because he understands better than anybody else the bottom line of the book, in a sense.

536
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:15,880
That is, how are we supposed to relate to this world woven in this sort of random way, in a colorful way, out of all of this random insects or woven out of whatever.

537
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,280
Then let's go on.

538
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:27,480
So he's left behind, he's lost, he's gone crazy, he's totally alone, see how horrible it all is to be alone.

539
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:37,560
He sees, and then he sees the what I just said in 401, okay, the coral insects.

540
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,000
What did he see then?

541
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,080
What is the truth about, quote, creation, the way the world works?

542
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:51,400
That the world is the random result of the random actions of all these little insects, and it adds up to a beautiful bunch of colors.

543
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:55,639
There was no plan, but there's a rainbow anyway.

544
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,280
And what is his attitude?

545
00:53:58,279 --> 00:54:05,560
Well, he's a hero, you know, oddly enough, or maybe not so odd, because he has seen the deepest truth.

546
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:10,599
And so you get that on way back on page 115, the first description.

547
00:54:10,599 --> 00:54:15,639
Black little Pip, he never came back.

548
00:54:15,639 --> 00:54:21,480
He went before, poor Alabama boy, on the grim Pequad's forecastle.

549
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:38,480
You shall ere long see him beating his tambourine, prelusive of the eternal time, when sent for, this is all wild, when sent for to the great quarterdeck on high, he was bid strike in with the angels and beat his tambourine in glory, called a coward here, hailed a hero there.

550
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:47,200
That is, he saw the truth about the way the universe is lined up, and that's the sense in which he's a hero.

551
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:53,040
He didn't demand any more meaning, and he didn't have any less meaning.

552
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:57,519
I mean, he gets hooked up with Ahab, and it's too early to tell you how they hang together.

553
00:54:57,759 --> 00:55:03,599
Ahab demands a total meaning, an answer to what the universe is all about.

554
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:08,959
And Pip is the hero who doesn't make any demands on the universe.

555
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:15,520
And together, they form a kind of team that somewhere the truth lies between them.

556
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:24,880
But Pip is so much more of a hero than Ahab because Pip accepts completely that there is no meaning.

557
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:31,200
And in the end, he accepts that there is no Pip because this is so completely blowing his mind.

558
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:35,040
He says on the top of 500, Pip, whom call ye Pip?

559
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,040
Pip jumped from the whale boat.

560
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,560
Pip is missing.

561
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:42,879
And that is, he's lost his identity.

562
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,320
He's lost his mind.

563
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:51,280
He's seen the total sort of wonder and randomness of the whole thing.

564
00:55:51,279 --> 00:55:53,760
And now, let's see.

565
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:57,680
I write down here when I'm trying to explain this to myself.

566
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,840
This is not a deep interpretation of what it all means.

567
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:10,000
It just says that all there is is a proliferation of colors or intuitions or perspectives.

568
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,080
And they're all equally okay, and they don't add up to anything.

569
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:18,280
And Pip has seen it.

570
00:56:18,279 --> 00:56:23,320
And he is, in a way, crazy by his openness.

571
00:56:23,319 --> 00:56:26,359
And Ahab is crazy by his demanding an answer.

572
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,680
That's what you get at the top of 501.

573
00:56:28,679 --> 00:56:31,560
There go two daft ones, muttered the old Manksman.

574
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:35,639
One daft with strength, that's Ahab, and the other daft with weakness.

575
00:56:35,639 --> 00:56:36,599
That's Pip.

576
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:40,759
But weakness isn't a bad thing, because he's a hero, Pip.

577
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:47,320
Weakness, when you understand it, is openness and facing reality as it really is.

578
00:56:47,319 --> 00:56:51,800
Pip's got it, whereas Ahab can't buy it.

579
00:56:51,799 --> 00:56:59,800
Now, we're going to get to where Pip understands the way the book works.

580
00:56:59,799 --> 00:57:03,160
What do we do if we're in a world like that?

581
00:57:03,799 --> 00:57:05,160
What's our job?

582
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:06,440
And how do we do it right?

583
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,800
And how do we do it wrong?

584
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:10,839
It's all told in the story of the Debloon.

585
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,000
Now we have to talk about that.

586
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:30,280
Again, late in the book and utterly independent of the plot, Ahab comes out one day and puts a doubloon up on the mast, nails this gold coin up on the mast, and says he'll give it to whoever is the first one to spot Moby Dick.

587
00:57:30,279 --> 00:57:35,080
And so the coin becomes a kind of symbol of Moby Dick.

588
00:57:35,239 --> 00:57:46,599
The top of 416, now it says about five lines down: the mariners revered it, that's the doubloon, the gold coin, as the white whale's talisman.

589
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:49,560
That is the white whale's representative.

590
00:57:49,880 --> 00:58:03,440
And then what happens is, and this then the whole chapter, each important character comes up to the doubloon and makes it sees something in it.

591
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:13,119
So and I can't go into too much detail because you don't know the people yet who are coming up, presumably, but I have to just say enough.

592
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:19,839
So Ahab comes up to it at the bottom of 416, and it's got a big description of what it is.

593
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:27,199
It's got towers and peaks, and it's got words, Republic to Ecuador to Quito, and it's got a flame and a zodiac.

594
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,720
It's full of stuff.

595
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,639
It's very rich and colorful, you might say, the coin.

596
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:36,400
And everybody comes up and sees something in it.

597
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,400
And so Ahab sees in it at the bottom of 416.

598
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:44,720
There's something ever egotistical in mountaintops and towers.

599
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:48,080
These three peaks are as proud as Lucifer.

600
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,920
That fern tower is Ahab.

601
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,439
The volcano is Ahab.

602
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,480
Ahab is all Ahab.

603
00:58:54,480 --> 00:59:05,040
And this round coin is but the image of the rounder globe, which, like a magician's glass, to each and every man in turn puts, but mirrors back his own mysterious self.

604
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:20,159
So Ahab is saying, I'm projecting my meaning on this coin, and that's exactly what the coin shows you, that there is, that proud Ahab is interpreting the coin.

605
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:23,440
It's a kind of reflexive thing.

606
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:37,520
And then Starbuck, who you will hear a lot more about, who's a religious Christian, comes up and gives it an interpretation on 417 that the peaks are the Trinity.

607
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:46,519
And yet, and this is, Starbuck is always sort of worried he's going to lose his faith surrounded by people like Ishmael and even worse like Ahab.

608
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:51,159
So in the middle of 417, he says, yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture.

609
00:59:51,159 --> 00:59:57,080
And if at midnight we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we gaze for him in vain.

610
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:01,799
This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still sadly to me.

611
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:04,680
I'll quit it, lest truth shake me falsely.

612
01:00:04,679 --> 01:00:07,240
So there goes Starbuck.

613
01:00:07,239 --> 01:00:10,759
Now Stubb looks at it and gives a fatalist interpretation.

614
01:00:10,759 --> 01:00:12,920
There's no reason to tell you about that now.

615
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:21,959
Flask, the lowest level, sort of simple-minded materialist, looks at it and gives it an interpretation, which is sort of funny.

616
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:36,280
He says, well, it's got so much weight of gold, and at the bottom of 418, I see nothing here but the round thing made of gold, and whoever raises a certain white whale, this round thing belongs to him.

617
01:00:36,279 --> 01:00:39,240
So what's all this staring been about?

618
01:00:39,239 --> 01:00:41,719
It's worth $16, and that's true.

619
01:00:41,719 --> 01:00:45,480
At two cents a cigar, that's 960 cigars.

620
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:56,119
So from these, there are these lofty interpretations and these sort of middle interpretations with Christian had been there, this total materialist interpretation.

621
01:00:56,119 --> 01:01:01,080
Queque comes up, and you'd think he would do something important.

622
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,840
And in a way, he does.

623
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:08,359
He compares the writing on the balloon to the tattooing all over his body.

624
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:11,480
This is two-thirds of the way down in 419.

625
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:17,720
But since we haven't, I'm pretty sure, talked about Quequeg and the tattooing all over his body, have we?

626
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:18,599
I don't think so.

627
01:01:18,599 --> 01:01:20,279
No, we won't talk about that yet.

628
01:01:20,279 --> 01:01:22,119
That's important, very important.

629
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:24,440
So Quequeg compares it to that.

630
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:28,560
But then I did all this to make sure we get to Pip in time.

631
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,239
And now we get back to Pip.

632
01:01:24,679 --> 01:01:31,520
He's been watching all this.

633
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:35,119
And now he says his own story.

634
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,359
At the very bottom, oh, more and more.

635
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,560
This way comes Pip.

636
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,520
Although the Manxman is watching and commenting on it.

637
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:47,359
Poor boy, would he had died, or I.

638
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:49,520
He's half horrible to me.

639
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,880
He too has been watching all these interpreters.

640
01:01:52,880 --> 01:02:05,280
Remember, all these are interpretations of this one talisman, as he calls it, sort of representative of Moby Dick the white whale.

641
01:02:05,279 --> 01:02:16,080
And they're all reading it from some angle, as if they are putting on some colored classes or other to giving it an interpretation from their point of view.

642
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:19,920
So he's been watching all these interpreters, myself included.

643
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:23,760
And look now, he comes to read with that unearthly idiot face.

644
01:02:23,759 --> 01:02:26,239
Stand away again and hear him, Ark.

645
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,400
Now, what does he say?

646
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:30,879
He says the sort of moral of the book.

647
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,400
You could put it at the beginning.

648
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,080
I look, you look, he looks, we look, ye look, they look.

649
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,680
That's what he said.

650
01:02:37,679 --> 01:02:43,840
And the guy commenting says, upon my soul, he's been studying Murray's grammar, improving his mind, poor fellow.

651
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:44,959
But that's what he says.

652
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:49,520
And then he says it again: I look, you look, he looks, we look, ye look, they look.

653
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:53,680
And he says it again.

654
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,599
And then now we have to stop.

655
01:02:58,159 --> 01:02:59,359
What does that say?

656
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:08,960
That says each person reads his own interpretation into the white whale, into the universe, onto the doubloon.

657
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,879
All there are are perspectives.

658
01:03:12,199 --> 01:03:19,159
There's no right answer to what the doubloon says, but each of them thinks they've got the answer to.

659
01:03:19,159 --> 01:03:23,880
And this reflects their way of interpreting themselves in their world.

660
01:03:24,199 --> 01:03:32,599
But of course, they can't all be right, and it certainly doesn't add up to any interpretation.

661
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,119
And that's what Pip sees.

662
01:03:34,119 --> 01:03:40,920
He says, and you, and I, and you, and he, and we, and ye, and they are all bats.

663
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:45,159
And I'm a crow, especially when I stand atop this pine tree.

664
01:03:45,159 --> 01:03:47,479
Now, that's pretty weird.

665
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:52,839
I didn't understand that for a long time, but now I think I sort of do understand that.

666
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:57,479
To say that they're all bats is to say what we say when we say somebody's bats.

667
01:03:57,479 --> 01:04:00,519
They're crazy and they're blind.

668
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:05,559
They don't see that theirs is just an interpretation.

669
01:04:05,559 --> 01:04:10,040
And they take very seriously their interpretation.

670
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,759
That's their craziness and blindness.

671
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,439
But Pip's a crow.

672
01:04:14,439 --> 01:04:16,359
Now, why is he a crow?

673
01:04:16,359 --> 01:04:21,159
Well, again, it took a long time to decipher that one, but he gives you the clue to that one.

674
01:04:21,159 --> 01:04:25,799
He says he's a crow when he stands atop the pine tree there.

675
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,000
What does that mean?

676
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:33,879
The pine tree there is the mast, and he is a crow when he's in the crow's nest at the top.

677
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:37,319
And why is he, and what does that mean?

678
01:04:37,319 --> 01:04:41,559
Well, that means that he doesn't have an interpretation.

679
01:04:41,559 --> 01:04:58,799
He's been blasted out of all interpretations when he saw the absolute blankness of, well, when he knows, no, that's the wrong way to put it, when he saw God's foot and saw the coral insects and lost any particular interpretation and lost himself.

680
01:04:54,840 --> 01:05:01,759
So he hasn't got a particular interpretation.

681
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,439
What's he got?

682
01:05:03,439 --> 01:05:07,519
He's got what you could call, in Foss, if he talked, a meta-interpretation.

683
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:15,599
That is, he's got the interpretation that I've just been giving you, that it's all interpretations, that I look, we look, they look, and so forth.

684
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,719
And he's got it from a meta-perspective.

685
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:29,279
That is, whereas they're all down horizontal, each one looking at the doubloon and reading their thing into it and believing that that's the right story.

686
01:05:29,279 --> 01:05:35,920
And he is looking from the top, and he's not adding them all up, not at all.

687
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:46,719
He's just drawing the conclusion: well, all there are is lots of interpretations, and everybody's got their own different interpretation, and that's all there is to it.

688
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:49,199
That's what he sees from the crow's nest.

689
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:54,719
There are many interpretations.

690
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,439
There is nothing but interpretations.

691
01:05:57,439 --> 01:06:02,639
And he can see that because he hasn't got any interpretation of a normal sort.

692
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:06,080
He's got an interpretation that it's all interpretations.

693
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:09,840
And that gives him a higher perspective.

694
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:10,319
Aha.

695
01:06:10,479 --> 01:06:15,359
And you wanted to say something earlier, a long time ago, as, oh, I'm sorry.

696
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:16,399
When he's up there.

697
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,759
We don't hear that he's uncomfortable.

698
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:31,840
I don't think he's, let's put it this way, he's certainly not nearly as uncomfortable as when he's in the whaling boat or even when he's in the ocean, relative to his normal difficult situations.

699
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:35,359
I don't think he's complaining about being in the crow's nest.

700
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:37,119
He just says he's a crow.

701
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:50,040
And when he's a crow, it looks like he has just succeeded in stating Melville's view of reality, that there's nothing but interpretations.

702
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:53,319
And by the way, this is also Nietzsche's view.

703
01:06:53,319 --> 01:07:03,239
And when Nietzsche says it in the Gay Science, which is one of his books, Nietzsche then says, of course, you'll tell me that that's just another interpretation.

704
01:07:03,239 --> 01:07:05,399
And he says, so much the better.

705
01:07:05,399 --> 01:07:15,399
I mean, again, so Melville will say something like, yeah, but Pip's interpretation is somehow better than all the individual interpretations.

706
01:07:15,399 --> 01:07:17,159
But it's still only an interpretation.

707
01:07:17,319 --> 01:07:20,199
Melville's very consistent about that, I think.

708
01:07:20,199 --> 01:07:23,479
And just as Melville always says, whatever he says is an interpretation.

709
01:07:23,479 --> 01:07:24,519
This is what I think now.

710
01:07:24,519 --> 01:07:26,199
This is the mood I'm in now.

711
01:07:26,199 --> 01:07:29,239
This is the intuition I've got now.

712
01:07:29,559 --> 01:07:34,519
But Pip's got the truest intuition, if you could say that.

713
01:07:34,519 --> 01:07:49,559
He's got the deepest interpretation or something like that of anybody in the book because he's seen that all there is is the weaver and the coral interest and insects, that's half the story.

714
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:53,719
And he's seen that everybody reads their interpretation into the doubloon.

715
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:55,799
That's the other half of the story.

716
01:07:55,800 --> 01:08:10,279
That's Melville's Melville's view of what the world is up to, what the world is, how it works, and our role, and how we should relate to it, how we do relate to it, and how we should relate to it.

717
01:08:10,279 --> 01:08:15,639
We do relate to it, like all the people who came up and read one meaning into the world or the doubloon.

718
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:21,960
Those are the fanatics, the religious people like Starbuck, the monomaniacs.

719
01:08:22,519 --> 01:08:32,239
And then there's the other possibility of how we should relate to it, namely the enjoy the whole rainbow, travel around and see the sacred everywhere.

720
01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:33,519
And then there's poor Pip.

721
01:08:33,519 --> 01:08:36,479
It's not even a story of how he gets a lot out of it.

722
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:46,080
He just happens to, it's not even pleasant being crazy and having no identity, but he does have the deepest understanding of what everybody else is doing.

723
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,479
Okay, now, you want to say more?

724
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:49,680
No, you want to say more, Kevin.

725
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:49,920
Okay.

726
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:50,880
I've got to come up closer.

727
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,080
You've got to talk louder.

728
01:08:55,119 --> 01:09:03,920
Mine looked really nice with what we were talking about earlier with believer-dye meetings and distance mountains rounding around the line.

729
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:05,040
Good.

730
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:05,519
Yeah.

731
01:09:05,519 --> 01:09:15,519
I mean, I see what Kevin is saying is the idea that you should get sort of as many, hear as many voices and see as many colors as possible.

732
01:09:15,519 --> 01:09:21,839
That's what makes life worth living, so to speak, and makes as much meaning as you can get.

733
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:25,199
There's another whole story about another kind of meaning you can also get.

734
01:09:25,199 --> 01:09:28,799
So that I haven't, I can't go into yet.

735
01:09:29,119 --> 01:09:31,839
So there are really two stories of what you could do.

736
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,119
But that's one of them.

737
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:37,199
And Pip has this sort of way of doing things.

738
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:38,880
Why didn't this ever happen before?

739
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,159
I mean, somehow or other.

740
01:09:40,159 --> 01:09:40,559
I see.

741
01:09:40,559 --> 01:09:43,599
They've scheduled something after this, which they don't usually do.

742
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:56,239
Anyway, so you're saying, Kevin is saying, you can, Pip can see, it's like traveling around, except, I mean, I'm just saying, of course, he's not getting anything out of it from up there.

743
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:59,920
It's not as if he takes on one or another of any of these interpretations.

744
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:02,319
So he's got only half the story.

745
01:10:02,319 --> 01:10:11,719
Everything is an interpretation, and the more interpretations you can visit or see and observe and so forth, the better.

746
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:21,639
But while you're, and this is important, when you visit these, then for the time being, you immerse yourself in them, presumably.

747
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:30,920
The way you'll see, he immerses himself in Ahab's monomania and in a lot of other interesting situations.

748
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:34,199
Have I disagreed with you, or just that, oh, you meant something different.

749
01:10:34,199 --> 01:10:34,599
We'll try it.

750
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,599
Don't do it, say it again.

751
01:10:37,319 --> 01:10:38,439
The earlier idea.

752
01:10:38,439 --> 01:10:39,720
Did you have another little bit?

753
01:10:40,199 --> 01:10:42,679
Okay, I didn't mean to get rid of that.

754
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:44,359
You've got to be, but you're right.

755
01:10:44,359 --> 01:10:45,399
I didn't get it clear.

756
01:10:45,399 --> 01:10:56,439
What Kevin has said is that you've got to have a distance from the weaver god so that it doesn't just blast you with white noise in order to be able to appreciate all the many voices.

757
01:10:56,439 --> 01:11:04,199
And that, but I'm just saying that's true, but we mustn't think that Pip has got that because he's not going to hear anything.

758
01:11:07,239 --> 01:11:17,080
He's beyond the white noise, he's beyond the many voices, he's just in the face of the weaving, I guess, or the, I don't know what he's in the face of.

759
01:11:17,159 --> 01:11:17,799
Yeah.

760
01:11:18,199 --> 01:11:21,639
Okay, Dan, Dave, you get the last word.

761
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:26,279
We're all blind.

762
01:11:26,279 --> 01:11:28,439
I don't like that, but I'm glad you brought it up.

763
01:11:28,439 --> 01:11:30,599
I wish he hadn't included himself.

764
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:33,799
I wish he had just left himself in the crow's nest.

765
01:11:34,119 --> 01:11:39,319
Because he isn't bats in the sense that he doesn't read an interpretation into the bloom.

766
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:44,679
So why he's a bat, blind, I don't know.

767
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:49,319
I mean, I could make up a very clever story, but I think it's too clever by half, but I'll say it.

768
01:11:49,319 --> 01:11:53,960
I mean, there are these two meanings of bats: crazy and blind.

769
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:56,159
He's bats in the sense he's crazy.

770
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,279
Everybody says that.

771
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,920
I mean, he can't live in the normal world anymore.

772
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:04,880
I hope he's not blind as a bat, because I don't know how to understand him as blind.

773
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,719
Do you have a view about it?

774
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:20,000
I hope that's not what it means, but it might.

775
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:21,279
I can't answer it.

776
01:12:21,279 --> 01:12:22,159
You get the last word.

777
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:24,080
It's one minute till five.

778
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:24,800
Uh-huh.

779
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,119
That's interesting.

780
01:12:27,119 --> 01:12:27,759
Wow.

781
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,119
Full of surprises.

782
01:12:29,119 --> 01:12:30,879
Bats can see at night.

783
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:31,679
I love it.

784
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:32,960
Wouldn't that be neat?

785
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:38,799
Bats are blind if they're trying to see in the bright light and see the answer.

786
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:42,399
If they come out at night, they're okay.

787
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:47,199
I can't I Melville is just so smart and he's not even thinking.

788
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:48,880
I mean, Melville is beyond thinking.

789
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,319
He may have that in mind.

790
01:12:50,319 --> 01:12:52,000
Anyway, I I like it.

791
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,439
Okay, time is up.
