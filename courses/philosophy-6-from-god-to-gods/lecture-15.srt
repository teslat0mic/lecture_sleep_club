1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,439
To start, I have to get a running start and go back over what it is to be a work of art, because that's going to turn out to be very important for understanding, at least for my understanding, and I hope I can help with your understanding of some of the very, very strange things that John, the Gospel of John, reports that Jesus says.

2
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:30,040
So, but I have to go back to the, and it wouldn't hurt at this point in the course anyway, to kind of review where we are.

3
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:37,479
So, first, I'm going to talk about two kinds of works of art, articulating and reconfiguring.

4
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,760
I've already said that once or twice, but we never actually got there.

5
00:00:42,760 --> 00:01:03,080
All we've talked about so far are articulating works of art that, like the Odyssey to begin with, and then also the Orestea and the Aeneid, they focus and glamorize and hold up to the people the understanding of being they share.

6
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:10,919
Remember, that's sort of what it is to be a thing, what is the best sort of thing, and what is it to be a person.

7
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,280
And we've seen examples of that, that they let things show up in various ways.

8
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:25,399
I haven't talked much about that, and I'm not going to talk about that now, but that they, people show up in different ways.

9
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:45,159
That is, they show up as heroes or as patriotic Athenians or as dutiful citizens, and coming up now as, in effect, saints and sinners, both not so much in the Gospel of John, but extremely clearly in the divine comedy.

10
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:53,879
And the work of art is, I don't know if I've ever used this talk, but it's a kind of exemplar.

11
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:08,000
It's something or some person's speech or something in the world that holds up to the people their understanding of being or their style.

12
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:10,479
Let's find another way to put it.

13
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:20,640
It gives us our outlook on things and it gives people their outlook on things and on themselves, as the way Heidegger puts it.

14
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,399
How many have read?

15
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:23,600
Probably not at this stage yet.

16
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,119
Kuhn's book, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, very many.

17
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:40,479
He has this notion of paradigm, which holds up to the scientists what a good piece of work is, so that for modern science, it was Newton's Principia, which was the paradigm.

18
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,200
Well, this is a kind of paradigm for the culture.

19
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,320
That's another way to put it.

20
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:51,440
It's something specific that is in the world and that you can see and that people can all see together.

21
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,839
That holds up to the people what the culture is all about.

22
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:10,560
And it can be done by a book or that is an epic or a play or a speech like Pericles' speech, which I read you a little bit, and which Abraham Lincoln is, in a way, copying when he gives the Gettysburg Address.

23
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:20,640
Pericles is talking at the funeral for the Athenian heroes, and Lincoln is talking about the funeral for the soldiers fighting in the Civil War.

24
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:31,039
And each of them do this job of telling the people what it is they're up to and enabling them all to see it more clearly.

25
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:37,279
They they are, as they, I think, even say, rededicating what's going on.

26
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:46,680
They're focusing it and they are renewing it by focusing it and glamorizing it and holding up to the people.

27
00:03:48,919 --> 00:04:06,680
And the another way to put it that Heidegger uses, he wants to when Heidegger wants to generalize from works of art like temples or plays to speeches like Pericles and Lincoln, he can hardly call those works of art.

28
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,359
He calls them truth setting itself to work.

29
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:11,880
The work is still in there.

30
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:21,880
It's the same work, the same work as the artwork working, namely if shining and holding up to the people what they're up to and what they are.

31
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:30,360
But when he says it's truth setting itself to work, he means that it reveals a certain understanding.

32
00:04:30,679 --> 00:04:36,040
Heidegger uses truth and revealing as synonymous.

33
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:45,479
So a work of art reveals a certain truth about people and the world and so forth.

34
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:52,760
Not a truth, however, of the old-fashioned sort, that it was always true that this is what people were and things were.

35
00:04:52,760 --> 00:05:04,680
The work of art holds up a a truth that works for a while for a particular bunch of people, like the Greek temple or the medieval cathedral, to throw in another one, does.

36
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:12,920
So so when Heidegger wants to generalize from temples and cathedrals to artworks to what else?

37
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,479
Statesman he has in here.

38
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:23,400
Well, the other ones are s strange ones, which will only confuse this what we're saying right now.

39
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,640
So I don't I enough of that.

40
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:30,080
He talks, anyway, the general term is that it's truth setting itself to work.

41
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,000
If that seems so weird that it doesn't make sense to you, don't worry about it.

42
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,919
Just think about artworks and what it is for them to work.

43
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,440
And another way to describe what it is for them to work is that they shine.

44
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:55,680
That's going to turn out to be very important, always, that they are shining exemplars of what, that's what I've been calling glamorizing, but you won't find glamorizing in word in Heidegger.

45
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:58,799
You'll find shining, but it comes to the same thing.

46
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:00,719
You make it beautiful.

47
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:03,520
Heidegger says to be beautiful is to be shining.

48
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:06,239
It's all the same idea.

49
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:15,279
But it's nice to call it shining because you can make this kind of play on words that I make.

50
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:17,839
You can see things in its light.

51
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:22,000
The Greeks see themselves in the light of the temple.

52
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,279
The medievals see themselves in the light of the cathedral.

53
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,680
The Athenians saw themselves in the light of what Pericles was saying.

54
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,200
That is, and that creates them.

55
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,599
I mean, that's what's so clear in Aeschylus.

56
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:52,560
I mean, what makes them the kind of citizens they are is that they understand that they're the kind of citizens who have pride in, above all else, pride in their polis, in their city-state.

57
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:59,440
And they're proud of the fact that they are unique in being proud of their city-state.

58
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:09,279
And they're justified in being proud of it because being proud of it is this highest emotion of patriotism that trumps all the troubles with the Furies and Apollo and so forth.

59
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:19,320
That's just you, and they all venerate the work of art working or truth setting itself to work as something sacred.

60
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:34,200
That's the remember I say they memorize Homer, they replay the chorusia every year, they set up shrines to the divine comedy and to the Aeneid and so forth.

61
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,160
And why is that, why are they sacred and so important?

62
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:41,000
Because it's just another way of saying they give meaning to their lives.

63
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:55,640
They understand what it is, why it's worthwhile being an Athenian or being a Roman or being a Christian and what it entails to do that, what you have to do to be one of those.

64
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,960
So no surprise that Heidegger calls them gods.

65
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:10,600
It's a funny different use of God, but he calls them gods because they create the world of these various people.

66
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,080
They don't produce the world.

67
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:27,159
I mean, the idea of creation is sort of producing the universe as it gets, comes out of this funny mixture of the Hebrew idea that there's a creator God and the Roman idea that the understanding of being is production.

68
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:30,920
Then you get an idea that God is sort of the big producer.

69
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:46,200
But Heidegger wants to generalize the notion of God, that a God is whatever it is that creates a world for a people and creates people as the kind of people they are.

70
00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:49,399
That's all, that's the job of a God.

71
00:08:49,399 --> 00:09:06,640
And people don't know Heidegger, but they know that there's something going on with these particular works when they're working that it makes them sacred, makes them holy, makes them have an absolutely central place in the world of these people.

72
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,640
Okay, so much.

73
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:11,039
Anybody want to say anything about that?

74
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:13,279
That's just a review of where we are so far.

75
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:27,360
Every work we've studied so far is an articulating work of art and in a way renewing work of art, telling people, reminding people of what they stand for and why it's important and gives meaning to their life.

76
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:35,679
And I don't think I, I mean, I don't even want to say anything more about it, so if nobody raises their hand immediately, I'd be just as happy and go on.

77
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:38,800
Because what we want to do is get to something new.

78
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:46,720
What I haven't said anything about, it's not that I remember anyway, not much, is reconfiguring works of art.

79
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,440
What is a reconfiguring work of art?

80
00:09:49,439 --> 00:10:07,520
Well, I haven't really clearly distinguished in talking about the articulating ones, whether they create the world for the first time for these people, or whether they make it shine, hold it up, glamorize it, and renew it.

81
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,120
But I'm saying that.

82
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,320
How can you tell?

83
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:12,319
Well, for all, I'm jumping ahead.

84
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:17,360
A reconfiguring work of art, if there were one, would create a new world.

85
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:20,720
It wouldn't renew the world that's there.

86
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:28,080
That's what these all, I mean, presumably, it's a little hard to know what happened with Homer, because it's all in the dim, distant past.

87
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:39,280
Presumably, somewhere along the line, the power of the pantheon and the suppression of the furies produced this Homeric world.

88
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:53,960
But by the time Homer comes along, the Homeric world is already there, and he's singing about it and showing the people at the dinner parties what a great thing it is and what a great thing it is to be part of this world.

89
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:10,280
So, and the way you can tell that Homer isn't a reconfigurer is that there's already a shared language and a shared understanding of what it is to be a hero and who the gods are and what kind of sacrifices you should make to them.

90
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:12,840
He doesn't have to explain that to people.

91
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:14,760
He reminds them of that.

92
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,719
He renews it.

93
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:17,239
He praises it.

94
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,440
He makes it shine.

95
00:11:18,439 --> 00:11:20,200
But he doesn't make it up.

96
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:21,880
And the same thing with Aeschylus.

97
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:36,680
He's got already the city-state of Athens, and he's taking the legal system, and he's taking the whole worship of the pantheon and the worship of the gods under the ground and all that.

98
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:44,760
He's got that, and he's trying to renew it and focus it and make it clearer and make people see how wonderful it is.

99
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,439
Okay, and the same, let's see.

100
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:59,880
And the Aeneid, of course, Rome's already going strong, but the emperor system is relatively new with Augustus, because he just changed it from a, what do you call it?

101
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,120
Can't just think of the word.

102
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,560
What were they before they were?

103
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,640
A republic.

104
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,440
That was their word for it.

105
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:06,760
Yeah.

106
00:12:06,760 --> 00:14:00,200
He changed it from a republic to an empire, changed it, but he, but the important thing is the that the understanding of being, for instance, and the understanding of the highest thing of being a human, namely being a dutiful citizen, that was already there but Verger was supposed to make it look beautiful to be a dutiful citizen he didn't exactly succeed I mean I think in the story about them all wishing that they wishing that they were dead and being happy when they were dead and having to be brainwashed in order to be sent back and recycled that all didn't seem too happy maybe that has something to do with the fact that he wants to say in the end that that all of this is an illusion or propaganda we don't we don't know but it does probably also have something to do in the end and that's what I said at the very end last time to how come Christianity can take over the whole Roman Empire so quickly and so totally from being just a remember it's a crazy little sect of an already crazy little sect I mean the Hebrews were just a tiny corner of the Roman Empire nobody really I think cared anything much about it and then the Christians were sort of a kooky fringe of the already weird Hebrews and yet after I don't know how many years I should know when does Constantine turn the Roman Empire over to Christianity 300 something like that it in in about 200 years from the time of Jesus that the Roman Empire is officially made totally Christian and that must be because there's just not any enthusiasm for the current religion which isn't much of a religion anyway I tried more and more to find out about these household gods and the most interesting thing I could find out about the household gods was nobody seems to know anything about them.

107
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:06,680
In no encyclopedia could I find any picture of them and they are they are the ancestor worship.

108
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,200
That's all you just hear.

109
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:12,520
Is that ancestors in general, or is this this particular family's ancestors?

110
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,840
You don't even find that out, though I presume it must be your ancestors or mine.

111
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,240
And do the gods look like these ancestors?

112
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,280
I don't know.

113
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,240
It's a funny thing.

114
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,080
You'd think that if there were these statues of these gods around, they'd still be around.

115
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:34,280
After the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, for instance, there was lots and lots of pottery and decorations and everything just preserved perfectly under all that lava.

116
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:36,680
So anyway, I don't know what happened to the Romans.

117
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:43,159
Their gods didn't really make it compared to all these other gods who are still around, and we still read about them.

118
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:48,679
And even though they're no longer working for us, they still seem to have a certain wonder.

119
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,600
Well, that was all just an aside.

120
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,279
Back, what was I?

121
00:14:52,840 --> 00:15:01,719
Okay, yes, I'm talking about how the Christians took over the Roman Empire.

122
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,159
But why was I talking about that?

123
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,120
I have no idea.

124
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,640
Does anybody remember?

125
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,960
Well, I probably will find out.

126
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:13,799
So, let me think.

127
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:19,799
About work of art, for sure, and why they need a new work of art, and why it isn't a renewing work of art.

128
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:22,600
That's the way I was going, a reconfiguring work of art.

129
00:15:22,599 --> 00:15:23,159
Yes, exactly.

130
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,399
The Aeneid is a kind of dead end.

131
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,559
He's trying to renew these virtues, and maybe he does.

132
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,199
They thought it did because they thought it was a sacred book.

133
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,679
But there was room.

134
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:41,959
And the Hebrews were going along, and they had priests, and they had a temple, and so forth.

135
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,279
And they could have been renewed.

136
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,119
But that isn't what happened.

137
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:48,839
Something much more dramatic happened.

138
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:52,839
They're a reconfigure of King of Wales, namely Jesus.

139
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,199
And how can you tell he's a reconfigurer?

140
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:06,000
Well, because everything is new with him, and he doesn't have a vocabulary that makes any sense to him or anybody else to talk about it in.

141
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:14,960
And he doesn't have any practices, and he doesn't have any temple or church or even the ark with the Torah in it.

142
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:25,440
It's all just him wandering around with his followers saying things so weird that they can't understand them.

143
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,039
They all seem completely stupid and dense, but it wasn't that the disciples were stupid and dense.

144
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:42,000
It's because there was no language for Jesus or them to say very much or anything very coherent about what they were up to.

145
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:56,240
If you want to look at a movie on a DVD which has captured this somewhat, Scorsese made a movie, The Last Temptation, which caused a kind of crisis and got yanked out of the theaters pretty quickly.

146
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,079
And it really wasn't very good anyway, I think, as a movie.

147
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:15,679
But the beginning of it is certainly interesting because Scorsese shows the sort of weird marginal sect of the Essenes, where John the Baptist was saying that the Messiah is going to come.

148
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,760
And when Jesus sort of wanders in, he says, that's him.

149
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,480
And everybody believes it, including Jesus, who maybe have believed it already.

150
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,200
I don't know.

151
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,240
It isn't clear.

152
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:43,879
But what's even more interesting in Scorsese is that it's clear, the way he shows it, that Jesus doesn't have the language and the practices and the institutions and the rituals to understand and express what he's doing.

153
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,879
So every time he does anything, he looks stunned.

154
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:58,839
I mean, there's a place where I think it's, I haven't seen it for a while, but I think when he says, let him who is guiltless cast the first stone as he's trying to save Mary Madeline, and nobody does.

155
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:05,799
And he's just looking around waiting for somebody and utterly puzzled by what he did and how it worked.

156
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:14,680
And when he saves Lazarus, when he goes into Lazarus' tomb and brings him out live, he's absolutely freaked out that he could do this thing and so forth.

157
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,279
And Scorsese's got that, I think, absolutely right.

158
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:25,079
That if you're a reconfigurer, you can't understand what you're doing.

159
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:30,760
Now, if you get too crazy, nobody can understand what you're doing, and you can't do anything.

160
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:35,399
You can't really start a new world and a new understanding of being.

161
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:45,879
You've got to have just the right mixture, and I'm going to come back and talk about that later, of enough of the old that they can make sense, sort of, of what you're doing.

162
00:18:45,879 --> 00:18:47,879
So Jesus can say, I'm the Messiah.

163
00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:53,159
Nobody quite knows what that means, but that's something that Hebrews are expecting.

164
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,160
Some of them think that's going to be God.

165
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,000
Some of them think that's going to be a prophet.

166
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,079
But whatever it is, at least that's something.

167
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:06,760
If he went over, say, in Bali and walked around and announced that he was the Messiah, that wouldn't work at all.

168
00:19:07,879 --> 00:19:10,599
You've got to have a certain context.

169
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:16,360
But, but except he has a huge amount of trouble explaining what he's up to.

170
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:21,959
So he talks in parables, and then the disciples still don't understand what he's up to.

171
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:43,599
And then the Gospel, and then John, who writes this, something between 100 and 200 years after Jesus walked around, does a lot of explaining because it's already those of you, I wonder, just curious, how many are Christians, not believers, but who know what Christianity is about and who go to church and so forth?

172
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,839
Okay, how many are Jewish?

173
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:56,000
And how many are in some other religion, like Buddhism and Shintoism and Islam and so forth?

174
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,279
There must be more than that.

175
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:57,760
No?

176
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,079
Boy, I thought we were more diverse.

177
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:07,839
And how many are just are atheists, not sort of, you know, radical raving atheists, just don't believe in this stuff?

178
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,720
Okay, my daughter is like that.

179
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,760
Only after she took this course, she became a polytheist.

180
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,439
Maybe I can convert you.

181
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,240
I bet there are no polytheists in the audience right now.

182
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,319
I should take a vote again at the end.

183
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:27,520
But, okay, well, I guess I'm trying to figure out how much I have to say about this.

184
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,560
I don't want to spend my time sort of talking about the history of this.

185
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,039
On the other hand, just don't feel embarrassed.

186
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:37,119
It's just to kind of test how many understand what the incarnation is.

187
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,399
Not all that many.

188
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,000
And the crucifixion, the same number, I suppose, and the resurrection.

189
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,760
Okay, well, I need to explain a lot.

190
00:20:47,200 --> 00:21:00,879
Okay, Jesus was a Hebrew, and he was a rabbi, and he had a father and a mother, and people knew who they were, Joseph and Mary, and he was born in Bethlehem.

191
00:21:00,879 --> 00:21:19,400
But he started going around getting a bunch of followers, renaming them, so that Saul gets renamed Paul, who's a very important figure in this, because Paul really, he wasn't, you know, he waited a minute, that's the different Paul, right?

192
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,199
Paul never knew Jesus, right?

193
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,480
Nobody, we don't know whether any of this written down is by anybody who actually was one of the disciples.

194
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,120
No, okay.

195
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:36,039
But then Paul, almost immediately after Jesus died, was crucified.

196
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,119
How many saw the passion of the movie?

197
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:43,319
That's one way to find out, at least what crucifixion means.

198
00:21:43,879 --> 00:21:57,480
So then Jesus went around saying all these incomprehensible things, which people who couldn't understand them wrote down, so they got even more incomprehensible.

199
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:05,000
And then the early Christian church sort of collected them and published them, and that's the Gospels that we've got.

200
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:14,359
Three of them seem to come from a common source because there's lots repeated verbatim in the Gospel of Mark, of Matthew, and Luke.

201
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:16,919
Although I think Luke alone has the Christmas story, doesn't he?

202
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,359
You probably know more about this.

203
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:20,600
Luke and Matthew.

204
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:21,079
Okay.

205
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:23,240
But John comes later.

206
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:31,480
Paul has already written lots of letters to Christian communities all over the known world and gone and traveled and explained this to them.

207
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:43,879
And this other source has been found and published with presumably added things that people remembered who heard Jesus.

208
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:55,920
And so John is the most sort of trying to make sense of it all and having enough to go on that it begins to sort of make sense out of it.

209
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,559
That's why we need to read him.

210
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,879
Okay, so now we're about to read him.

211
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:06,159
Let me just and see how we can understand what he's talking about.

212
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,240
Let me see, let me catch up where I am.

213
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,520
I'm just going to read now.

214
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:19,520
So instead of focusing or renewing, a reconfigurer creates a new understanding of what matters, a new understanding of what makes sense.

215
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:28,159
He reveals a new truth, and he has to have a new language to do it, which he doesn't have, but later people will make up.

216
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,639
And you'll see only much later.

217
00:23:32,639 --> 00:23:37,679
But I'll tell you now, because it's going to come back later, but it's better to have an overall view.

218
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:49,599
How does he solve this problem of being able to communicate it all to the Hebrews, the Jews, of which he is, after all, one and a rabbi, but he's saying these weird things.

219
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:51,520
How is he able to do that?

220
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:57,919
Well, I think, and I guess I get this from Heidegger, but you have to push hard to find it even in Heidegger.

221
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,679
So maybe I made it up, I don't know.

222
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:21,760
But in any case, I think what has to happen is that you have to find this person, this reconfigurer, has to find some marginal practices which are not very important, but which are something that people already understand, and take them and make them the central thing in what he's talking about.

223
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:39,200
And he has to take the practices that are most important to the people that he's talking to, the Jews, and the people, and that they most fully believe in and understand, and devote them to marginal, if not actually irrelevant.

224
00:24:39,799 --> 00:25:01,399
If you could do that, if you could switch that like that, you'd get a whole new culture, and you'd get something that was just marginally intelligible to people, but something that they could gradually come to understand, not even in one generation, but after all, it's still pretty unintelligible in John.

225
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:19,959
But gradually they will develop a language, they will develop rituals, prayers, the church, institutions like that, and begin to put it all together into this very, very, very coherent picture that Dante has by a thousand years later.

226
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:32,039
So the reconfigurer then takes the marginal practices, makes them central, and turns them into what is shining and sacred.

227
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:39,160
And finally, one more thing about all this sort of philosophical background, but then we can plunge in and try.

228
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:46,119
It turns out that a work of art, the way I've described it, has a threefold structure.

229
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:54,039
And that is, you've got to have the shared background practices that everybody has.

230
00:25:54,359 --> 00:26:02,279
And either you take them as central if you're doing articulating, or you at least take them as marginal.

231
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:15,720
But there's got to be an understanding of being already there that you're responsive to if you're going to be a reconfigurer or a articulator or a renew that is renewer or reconfigurer.

232
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:21,799
And of course, these practices are invisible to the people who live in them.

233
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:23,319
They just follow them.

234
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,520
They've been raised in them.

235
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:35,359
They say the kind of things that people say, and they do the kind of things that people do, and they condemn the kind of things that people condemn, and they praise the kind of things that people praise.

236
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,640
And that all has a style, but they don't see it.

237
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,400
Again, I say this every once in a while.

238
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:52,000
They live in it like fish in water and pass it on from generation to generation by imitation so that the kids will praise the same thing and say the same thing and so forth.

239
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:59,839
But that's very important, that background understanding of being, because that already makes these people the kind of people they are.

240
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:06,799
Well, back to that again, and makes whatever is important important and gives meaning to their lives.

241
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:13,520
And as I put it here, without these background practices, there wouldn't be any culture.

242
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,319
Nothing would be showing up as anything.

243
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:21,440
It'd just be a kind of, I don't know, sort of overwhelming mess.

244
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:27,839
But nobody ever is in that situation because everybody's already born into some culture or other.

245
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,920
What else then do you need?

246
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:39,599
To have, we're talking about truth setting itself to work, this general thing that has this general activity.

247
00:27:39,599 --> 00:28:17,000
Well, you've got to have some particular thing like a temple or an event, like Pericles' speech, or a person, and that will help make what's going on in the background, visible, by incarnating it so completely, by embodying it so completely and so beautifully and so shiningly that people can see and admire the style that they'd already had, but was invisible to them.

248
00:28:17,639 --> 00:28:34,359
And either they see the one they already had, that's articulation, or this whatever it is that sets to work and transforms can transform the whole world into a new way of making sense and a new kind of truth.

249
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:43,959
But something or person has to do it, then people will act in the light of the paradigm.

250
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,919
They will, that is, the work.

251
00:28:46,920 --> 00:29:10,279
And when they act in the light of this work, that means that in every situation they do what one does, if one's a whatever, a Hebrew or a Roman or a Homeric Greek or Asbenian Greek, they're all acting in the light of whatever it is that is their work of art, their cultural paradigm.

252
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:13,480
And there's one further thing.

253
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,480
Now, the three they all have.

254
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,319
But the Reconfigurer needs some fourth thing.

255
00:29:19,639 --> 00:29:21,799
And I've already been setting you up for it.

256
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:31,240
And I don't know any, Heidegger never says this, I don't think, but I think it's very interesting and true, that every Reconfigurer needs an articulator.

257
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:34,839
In effect, I've been just saying it without telling you.

258
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:48,520
Because if the Reconfigurers have no language and can't state what they're up to, can't even understand what's happening, like Jesus in the Scorsese movie, which I think is what's bound to happen to these people.

259
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:55,599
If that's so, then they need somebody who's going to come along and make sense of it.

260
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:57,279
And I've been already talking about that.

261
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:59,679
Paul already starts to make sense of it.

262
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:07,279
The three gospel writers that are similar do, and John certainly does.

263
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:13,679
They could have just one articulator, or they may have several articulators.

264
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,720
Usually there's one sort of obvious one.

265
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:24,879
I'm not sure who the obvious one is for the Bible, whether it's Paul or John.

266
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,400
And it keeps getting more and more articulated.

267
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,520
So there are more and more of them.

268
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:29,839
And St.

269
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,240
Augustine comes along and makes more sense of it.

270
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:32,880
And St.

271
00:30:32,879 --> 00:30:38,560
Thomas Aquinas, who you'll hear more about when we get to Dante, comes along and makes a summa out of it.

272
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,640
I mean, a total sum of articulating of it.

273
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,240
But there has to be at least an articulator, and then a lot of little articulators.

274
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,119
It helps if you're in philosophy.

275
00:30:52,319 --> 00:31:04,399
When I say it, and I sort of have prepared you for this too, to take another example, is another one of the big world reconfigurers is Descartes.

276
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,640
You don't have to be a holy person or a saint or a temple.

277
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:10,079
You can also be a philosopher.

278
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:15,599
I forgot to put that on my list when I was trying to remember what else makes truth happen.

279
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:17,760
What else sets truth to work?

280
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,039
Well, the other one I was looking for is us, philosophers.

281
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:25,279
Not like you or me, but great, great philosophers like Descartes.

282
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:40,760
And when Descartes starts thinking about us, he just sort of denies the whole Christian medieval tradition and pretty much the Greek too, because he invents this new something or other, namely being a subject.

283
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,960
People are subjects.

284
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:55,000
That is, they have a certain amount of total, well, they have, according to Descartes, total freedom, and they have an inner world, and they are separated, each one of them, from everybody else and from the external world.

285
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:08,279
If you had philosophy, what is it, 25B, History of Modern, starts with Descartes inventing us as subjects and inventing worlds as objects.

286
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:09,880
Sorry, things as objects.

287
00:32:09,879 --> 00:32:17,559
Things weren't objects, they were creatures, or they were stuff that welled up or whatever.

288
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:35,559
So, and Descartes is pretty incomprehensible in a way, because he's so smart, and yet he says seemingly stupid things every once in a while in his meditations, where he's gotten rid of God, really, by saying that every subject is independent and every subject is totally free.

289
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:45,800
But he brings in God in crucial ways, because he's still, that's the only language he's got to sort of fill out what he's understood.

290
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,719
Well, then he gets his articulated.

291
00:32:47,719 --> 00:32:51,159
And there's just one, and you've seen me write him on the board every once in a while.

292
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:52,120
That's Kant.

293
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:58,680
Kant comes along and says, Aha, Descartes has discovered that we are completely autonomous.

294
00:32:58,679 --> 00:32:59,640
Remember that?

295
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:12,440
That we are, we give the law to ourselves, that we are free, and that we are mature, that we don't depend on princes or popes or what else there would be.

296
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:13,480
I don't know.

297
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,480
Maybe those are the two main ones.

298
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:24,799
And Kant spells out in tremendous detail all the implications of Descartes and gives it a whole new language.

299
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:29,679
He doesn't give up subjects and objects, but he adds a whole bunch of other terms to make it clear.

300
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:40,079
And he puts God right out of the picture, where Descartes didn't have the capacity or the insight or the desire or something to do it.

301
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:45,200
So Descartes is the reconfigurer and Kant is the articulator.

302
00:33:45,520 --> 00:34:15,840
And Heidegger, who finds reconfiguring the most amazing thing people can do, that some people can disclose whole new worlds, thinks that even though Heidegger thinks Descartes is dead wrong and is a sort of disaster for the West, but he nonetheless says that Descartes is a greater philosopher than Kant and that certainly one of the greatest philosophers that ever lived just because he was able to pull off this thing of inventing modernity.

303
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,960
Okay, now we're going to talk about the Gospel of John.

304
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,799
For a moment, pause.

305
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:38,000
You've got all these characters now: articulators who are renewers, reconfigurers who invent or bring about, create really, whole new worlds, and articulators then who follow the reconfigurers.

306
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,039
We don't know who the reconfigurer is or what that puts, that gives Homer the world that he articulates.

307
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:49,440
And we don't know either who did the world that Aeschylus is articulating.

308
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,199
These reconfigurers are sort of off the chart.

309
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,559
Maybe there wasn't any.

310
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,559
I don't know how you could get along without it, though, so I think there must have been somehow.

311
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:03,440
But anyway, I can't say anything about it because history has not given us anything to go on.

312
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:12,039
But we can talk about a kind of amazing example where it's all really laid out in front of us.

313
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:37,880
That's why we have to read the Gospel of John, because there it's clear that there was already something, namely the whole druid, that was already articulated, and Jesus came along and reconfigured it, and then people like John articulated that, meaning we've got it all really right in front of us in that case.

314
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,879
And so we're going to look at that case.

315
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,839
John is interesting.

316
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:48,120
I just wrote down here because he knows Greek, and he's writing in New Testament Greek, which is a version of Greek.

317
00:35:48,119 --> 00:36:06,039
And he knows the philosophy of the Stoics, for instance, and he uses some of their terminology to try to capture, I think probably not very fortunately, but again, they're all just sort of staggering around in this overwhelming new world to try to capture what's going on.

318
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:14,440
So this famous beginning now of the Gospel of John, I have it in front of you, this sort of thing, it's called a kind of poem, the prologue.

319
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:23,320
This is sort of half in Greek, that is all in Greek, but the crucial term, in the beginning was the word.

320
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,760
What's that?

321
00:36:24,759 --> 00:36:28,360
Well, that's logos.

322
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,279
You've seen me write logos on the board.

323
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,439
Logos is something like the intelligible structure of everything.

324
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:39,320
So in the beginning, there was the intelligible structure of the cosmos.

325
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,360
And the word was with God.

326
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,960
I don't know what that means.

327
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,639
And the word was God.

328
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:49,639
I mean, God was the intelligible structure of the cosmos.

329
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:52,680
He was with God in the beginning.

330
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,279
Now it gets very, it's going to get very, very complicated very fast.

331
00:36:54,360 --> 00:37:00,960
Through him, all things came into being.

332
00:36:54,520 --> 00:37:01,759
Him.

333
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:08,159
The Stoic logos is a very abstract philosophical notion.

334
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,000
What is this him?

335
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:19,199
Well, it's John trying to say that somehow Jesus is the word.

336
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,280
That is, he's somehow the meaning of the cosmos.

337
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:31,840
This is going to get things into very quickly, into utterly complicated and pretty much unintelligible waters.

338
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,479
And you just go on.

339
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,039
What has come into being in him was life.

340
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:39,520
Life was the light of men.

341
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,760
And the light shines in the darkness.

342
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,840
He's going to be a shining example right away.

343
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,240
And darkness could not overcome it.

344
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:51,680
I found another translation which I like a whole lot better.

345
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,679
Not knowing New Testament Greek.

346
00:37:54,239 --> 00:38:02,959
I don't have my own opinion, but wouldn't it be nice if it said, and it did, the light shines in the darkness and the darkness did not understand it.

347
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,680
I think that's probably, that's what I've been saying.

348
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:07,359
Of course, they didn't understand it.

349
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,639
They didn't have any concepts for understanding it.

350
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:19,760
And it makes it seem much more sort of true to the phenomenon, less like some battle between light and dark of some mythical sort.

351
00:38:19,759 --> 00:38:27,440
And I take it, John was enough of a kind of philosophical person to have it the way I want it to be.

352
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,599
But anyway, I'm going to read it that way.

353
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,880
The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not understand it, could not understand it.

354
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,240
Okay, so now let's see.

355
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:41,159
So I've been reading on the first page of this.

356
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:44,120
I want to make sure I've read all the things I want to read.

357
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:45,559
Well, no, let's go on.

358
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,799
Stepping down a little bit, I mean, every bit of it.

359
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,679
Let's just read it all.

360
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:51,880
It is so strange.

361
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,999
I mean, those of you who never heard it must find it absolutely weird.

362
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:55,880
I'm Jewish.

363
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:02,199
I didn't read it until I was, I don't know, about 25, the Christian Gospels, and I had to teach it at MIT.

364
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:03,719
And that was really exciting.

365
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:09,319
And I thought, but I could, this seemed to me absolutely weird and incomprehensible.

366
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:16,680
The Christians will find it very strange if you try to really think about it instead of just hearing it like a litany.

367
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:18,679
A man came sent by God.

368
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:19,719
His name was John.

369
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:21,319
Now, this isn't this guy, John.

370
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:29,239
This is John the Baptist, who's out in this weird sect of Essenes, baptizing people and waiting for the Messiah.

371
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:30,039
His name is John.

372
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:32,119
He came as a witness to bear witness to the light.

373
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,559
That's Jesus, so that everyone might believe through him.

374
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:36,920
He was not the light.

375
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,760
He was to bear witness to the light.

376
00:39:38,759 --> 00:39:45,000
John says he's not the Messiah, but that guy is.

377
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:47,640
The word was the real light.

378
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:52,840
And this funny thing, the word now is going to be, that's Jesus.

379
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,960
The word was the real light that gives light to everyone.

380
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,640
He was coming into the world.

381
00:39:57,639 --> 00:40:02,919
He was in the world that had come into being through him, and the world did not recognize him.

382
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,679
You see, that's like, didn't understand him.

383
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,480
That's why I think that's the right way to translate it.

384
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:15,239
And it already begins to look peculiar, that he was in the world and had come into which the world.

385
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:18,840
He was in the world that had come into being through him.

386
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,720
A very peculiar relationship to create a world and be in it.

387
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:35,680
You'd think either if you were a creator, you'd be sort of outside it, sort of able to control it and produce it, or else you'd just be another creature in another something in the world.

388
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:38,800
But no, he had this peculiar relation.

389
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,680
And John says it again and again.

390
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,880
And each time it's just as unintelligible as the last.

391
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,239
But I want to read you a few more.

392
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:48,559
It's all over the place.

393
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,360
But where do I have it?

394
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,800
That's just a second.

395
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,840
Wow.

396
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,240
That isn't what I expected to see.

397
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:59,280
Well, now I am at a loss to find.

398
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:00,799
I'm just looking.

399
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:10,559
I must have marked them in lots of other places where you hear that he was in the world and the world was made through him.

400
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:12,240
Oh, maybe I haven't.

401
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:15,759
Either I've lost a page or I haven't got it marked.

402
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:18,479
Okay, well, one is enough.

403
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,160
And I may find it again.

404
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:27,839
That Jesus says, and John says every once in a while, this peculiar fact that Jesus was in the world and the world was made through him.

405
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,600
That's very important and very hard to understand.

406
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,079
And through it all, Jesus has a kind of double nature.

407
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:45,920
He's always sort of in the world and even a kind of victim of the world.

408
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,960
And at the same time, he's sort of in charge and overseeing things.

409
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,760
So he's the lamb of God.

410
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:55,680
I won't read where.

411
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,759
And he's also the shepherd.

412
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:02,000
It's a peculiar thing to be the sacrificial lamb and the shepherd.

413
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:11,079
He's the Lord, and he also is the humble foot washer and treats everybody as if he were their servant.

414
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:18,039
And he seems in the Gospel of John to know exactly what he's doing.

415
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:21,240
That's not Scorzes' way of thinking of it.

416
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:30,440
In the other Gospels, which is where Scorzes gets his, he doesn't seem to know from moment to moment what he's going to do next or what's going to happen next.

417
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:35,719
Or getting now more familiar and but equally strange, he says that he's the son of man, and he is.

418
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:41,480
He's a regular human being born of a mother and father, and that he's the Messiah.

419
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,719
And he even, but that's enough.

420
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:46,440
Now I'm going to, those are important, so let's look.

421
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:51,400
At 1251, you see the page numbers that I'm going to at the top of the page there.

422
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:57,159
At 1251, people say, you know, he's just an ordinary human being.

423
00:42:57,159 --> 00:43:05,559
At the bottom of 1251, they were saying, surely this is Jesus, son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know.

424
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:08,039
So that seems to be normal.

425
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:14,279
And then, but he is also, on 1246, the Son of God.

426
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:24,920
So on about two-thirds of the way down, he says, for God sent his Son into the world not to judge the world, but so that through him the world might be saved.

427
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:32,120
So he is both the Son of man and he is the Son of God.

428
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:41,559
And finally, in its most extreme puzzling story, but that's the really interesting story, that's what made Christianity so fascinating and important.

429
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:43,159
Jesus was God.

430
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:53,400
So he's both separate from God, who is the Father, and he is identical with God, who is the Father.

431
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:58,719
I mean, all of this is, you can imagine how hard it was for any of them to understand any of this.

432
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:02,640
And it is practically incomprehensible.

433
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:03,920
But there it is.

434
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:16,079
On 1264, he says at about 12 lines from the bottom on the far left, I'm going to the Father, and he says, the Father is greater than I.

435
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:23,760
But on 1258, he says that he's identical with the Father.

436
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:33,919
He says at the bottom of that first column above the division on 150, on 1258, the Father and I are one.

437
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:41,920
And he says on the cross on the other side on 1258, the Father is in me, and I am in the Father.

438
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:52,160
A dozen different ways of explaining what he is and what his relation to God is, all of them seeming incomprehensible, and all of them seeming inconsistent.

439
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:57,840
But that's because he just hasn't got a language to say what he is and what he's doing.

440
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,599
And either that's because, or we don't really know.

441
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:17,360
Is that because he was unable to say it, or because they were unable to hear it and write it down sensibly, or the people who wrote it down couldn't, the people who copied the people who wrote it down, because they weren't, none of them there, couldn't understand the people who had heard it.

442
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,280
I mean, where it got so confused, it doesn't much matter.

443
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:28,880
If there had been a clear way to talk about it, presumably he would have talked about it that way, and people would have written it down that way and managed to copy it that way.

444
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:32,079
It's just too complex, it's just too crazy for that.

445
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:47,640
And that's the sign, remember, that it's a reconfigurer, that he's saying something so original and so different than the Hebrews could ever imagine that they don't know how to think about it.

446
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:53,320
And so, John is trying to make sense of this.

447
00:45:53,960 --> 00:46:04,680
And the way Jesus says it that's most interesting to us, to me anyway, and I hope I can make it interesting to you, is on 1263.

448
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:24,120
The best way that John has to deal with it is at the bottom of the first column on 1263, where somebody has written down that Jesus said, and it's, I am the way, I am truth and life.

449
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:27,000
No one can come to the Father except through me.

450
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,280
And then comes the really interesting part to me: if you know me, you will know my Father too.

451
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,400
From this moment, you know him and have seen him.

452
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:47,240
That is, insofar as you're ever going to see God, the supreme being, that sense of the Father, you've already seen him when you've seen Jesus.

453
00:46:47,239 --> 00:47:06,280
And there's no, I mean, finally, a very, very radical Protestant theologian, Kierkegaard, whom I mention occasionally and whom I teach in Philosophy 7, says that once Jesus says this, then all attempts to get in any kind of relation to God the Father are finished.

454
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:13,079
Because the way to get in touch with God the Father is, and see him, is to see Jesus.

455
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:21,480
And so the Father stays invisible, and Jesus is the way you relate to him, you pray to him, you see him, and so forth.

456
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,960
That's very important.

457
00:47:23,239 --> 00:47:25,599
From this moment, you know him.

458
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:28,879
When you know me, from this moment, you know him and have seen him.

459
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,039
Oh, and here I wrote down, and the world is made through him.

460
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,920
It's a little late to find it, but let's see if it's really there.

461
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,640
1243.

462
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,480
Oh, it's back in the poem.

463
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,079
Maybe I read it already.

464
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,359
I don't know.

465
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,440
Hmm.

466
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,440
1243.

467
00:47:47,759 --> 00:47:56,159
Yeah, I guess I didn't read this, but I just had it staring me in the face at the bottom of 1243, at the very bottom of the left column.

468
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:01,440
He was in the world and had come into, that had come into being through him.

469
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,799
Did I read that already?

470
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:03,759
Maybe I did.

471
00:48:03,759 --> 00:48:11,039
Anyway, that's this, again, strange thing in which he seems to be, once you've seen him, you've seen God.

472
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,520
He's the creator of the world and at the same time, something in the world.

473
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,120
That strange relation is all over the place.

474
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:23,520
That's got to be something important.

475
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,280
And that he's shining in the darkness, we've seen that.

476
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,559
And the important thing that the world became flesh, just to say.

477
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,920
Oh, yeah, okay.

478
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:44,480
And he is in some way, the whole intelligible structure of the cosmos, which I can't, if you think you don't understand what I'm saying, don't be surprised.

479
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,079
I don't understand what I'm saying either.

480
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,920
That's the logos, anyway.

481
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,839
The logos became flesh.

482
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,559
That's this very strange claim.

483
00:48:52,559 --> 00:49:04,880
This completely seemingly abstract, stoic, philosophical notion, which wasn't even part of the Hebrew tradition, but part of the Stoic tradition, which is so weird.

484
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:06,319
Just happened.

485
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:18,760
This Jewish boy in Palestine just happened to be the place where that whole intelligible structure just got a body.

486
00:49:18,759 --> 00:49:23,720
So on the right, the word became flesh.

487
00:49:24,039 --> 00:49:37,960
And he lived among us, and we saw his glory, the glory that he has from the Father, which is pretty peculiar since he seems to be identical with the Father sometimes, as the only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth.

488
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:43,480
So the main thing is that the whole intelligible structure gets embodied.

489
00:49:43,639 --> 00:49:45,480
Why is that so important?

490
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:52,520
Well, remember how people felt about bodies at the end of the Aeneid, which is the same time as this.

491
00:49:53,159 --> 00:50:13,800
They felt, and I suppose the Stoics felt this about bodies, that bodies were something that got in the way and you'd be better off without them, and that they were this, this, what does Aeneas learn that they are lumpish and I forget the phrase, dull and so forth and so forth, and you would certainly be better off without one.

492
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,600
It just weighs you down and gets in the way.

493
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:21,079
Well, all of a sudden, and sort of out of nowhere, well, it's not out of nowhere.

494
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:24,760
The Hebrews never had that dim view of the body.

495
00:50:24,759 --> 00:50:33,959
But now it turns out, but the Hebrews had another thing that kept them from thinking that God couldn't become a body, flesh.

496
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,799
The Greek word there is meat.

497
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:41,240
I mean, it's really flesh, just the kind of flesh that, you know, bleeds and so forth.

498
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:49,079
The intelligible structure of the universe couldn't become meat in either the Hebrew version or the Greek version.

499
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:57,520
In the Greek version, it's because what's intelligible is something mental and structural.

500
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,439
It's not something in the world.

501
00:50:59,759 --> 00:51:03,840
In the Hebrew version, you can't make any image of God.

502
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:07,440
God is necessarily invisible.

503
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:14,399
When you get to Pascal, you'll see Pascal going on and on about the very peculiar fact that in the Hebrew tradition you've got a hidden God.

504
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:26,319
Instead of a God that sort of shines on you, and you see this God, God the Father, anyway, God can't be visible.

505
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:33,920
And I don't know how many of you noticed, I mean, the Hebrews have this prohibition against making any picture of God, making any music about God.

506
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:53,039
There's going to be no stained glass windows and no sung masses and no statues or anything like that of God because you can't do that because God is too outside the world and too super to become a body and to become visible.

507
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:59,199
And out of that, for some peculiar reason, which you have to think of your own reason.

508
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,039
Was it a message from God that did it?

509
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:05,920
Was it something stirring in the background practices that did it?

510
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:20,880
At this particular moment, this particular human being, Jesus, declares that he is a body and a man, and he is God.

511
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:28,640
And John is just reporting it made as if it's absolutely revolutionary.

512
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:32,480
And it changes the world, because it changes what it is to have a body.

513
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,719
I mean, it's the best thing you can do is to have a body.

514
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,440
God can have a body and wants to have a body.

515
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,920
So that certainly makes bodies pretty good to have.

516
00:52:41,239 --> 00:52:53,960
And it gets rid of this idea that you can't in any way see God because it's so abstract or so powerful or so outside the world, I think is the best way to put it, that you can't see it.

517
00:52:53,960 --> 00:53:00,680
And that's, you know, that's, well, just to use the fancy word now, that's the incarnation.

518
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:08,440
That's the specialist, that's the most, from my point of view anyway, the most important message of Christianity.

519
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:16,600
There is also the fact that Jesus was crucified, and that's the crucifixion and died on the cross.

520
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:22,440
There's the fact that he also rose and went to heaven, according to the gospel writers.

521
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,440
After that, that's the resurrection.

522
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:35,559
But I think the really revolutionary thing is the incarnation: that God became a body, got embodied, and at this point by this guy, at this moment in history.

523
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:44,440
And since God's embodied in him, then he can say what I already quoted, let's look, 1261, and maybe he says it several times.

524
00:53:45,719 --> 00:53:50,679
God got embodied so that if you see him, you've seen the Father.

525
00:53:50,679 --> 00:53:52,440
That's this important quote.

526
00:53:52,759 --> 00:53:58,760
Well, there's the top of, I've already quoted the top of 1263.

527
00:53:58,759 --> 00:54:01,000
If you know me, you will know my Father.

528
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,280
From this moment, you know him and have seen him.

529
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:08,360
Because that's now God who has that body.

530
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,960
1261.

531
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,480
You know, in the middle of 1261, it happens again.

532
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:20,520
Whoever believes in me believes not in me, but in the one who sent me, and whoever sees me seems the one who sent me.

533
00:54:20,679 --> 00:54:27,920
So that is, again, if you see Jesus, you see God, and God has become flesh.

534
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:46,079
So now, can we, supposedly, I hope that it probably has dawned on some of you that there's some kind of connection between what I said about reconfiguring in the beginning of this lecture and what I'm saying now.

535
00:54:46,400 --> 00:55:03,840
There is this huge problem of understanding this peculiar kind of identity in which Jesus is God and He's in the world and yet the world was made through Him.

536
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,559
How do you put all that together?

537
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:08,719
In Christian talk, that's the Trinity.

538
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:14,800
That's the Father, the Son, and we haven't said anything about the Holy Spirit, but that's the third part.

539
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,640
So God has three aspects all in one.

540
00:55:18,639 --> 00:55:22,800
And we've just been talking about them without naming them.

541
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,399
But now, what is it?

542
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,679
How are they all related?

543
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:28,240
It's a huge puzzle.

544
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:34,559
And I'm not going to tell you that I can sort of solve this puzzle, but I can do something.

545
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:47,919
If you understand Jesus as a reconfigurer, then you can understand why he's got to be part of a three-part structure, a Trinitarian structure.

546
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:54,319
The structure of works of art working as reconfigured.

547
00:55:54,559 --> 00:56:00,559
In fact, even articulators, now that I think of it, has always got to be a three-part structure.

548
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:22,120
And it just so happens that they've got these names, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, but of course, those names are pretty weird because God's some very strange kind of Father, for sure, and Jesus is a very peculiar kind of Son, and the Holy Spirit is something we haven't even heard about yet, but it's equally peculiar.

549
00:56:22,759 --> 00:56:25,960
But now, you can map the three-part structure.

550
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:41,400
If you want to understand why this weird religion came around with this weird Trinity in which God is both one and has three aspects, what you need to do, according to what I'm saying, is understand that Jesus is a reconfigurer.

551
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,839
And that's not very controversial.

552
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:51,400
I mean, if you want to talk about changing worlds, he changed the pagan antique world into the Christian world.

553
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,759
We started renumbering the calendar and so forth.

554
00:56:54,759 --> 00:57:01,000
If ever there was something that was recognized as a radical change of worlds, this was it.

555
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:06,920
And once you see that he's a reconfigurer, you have to see that he's going to have a three-part structure.

556
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,600
So what would that be?

557
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,240
You can just sort of map them onto each other.

558
00:57:11,239 --> 00:57:16,760
What's God the Father that is invisible and yet creates everything?

559
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:19,640
Well, that's the understanding of being.

560
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:25,240
In the practices, in the background practices, at least that's, you could think of it as that.

561
00:57:25,239 --> 00:57:34,039
They are, remember, for the people who have those practices, that creates them as the kind of people they are, creates the world as the kind of world they've got and so forth.

562
00:57:34,039 --> 00:57:35,960
And the practices are invisible.

563
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,439
You cannot represent them.

564
00:57:39,639 --> 00:57:45,320
The meaning in the practices, you can't draw a picture of it or write music about it or anything like that.

565
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,400
It just isn't the sort of thing.

566
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,000
It isn't a thing at all.

567
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,559
And it can't be visible at all.

568
00:57:51,559 --> 00:57:53,480
And it doesn't shine at all.

569
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:59,199
It's just there doing its job as the ground of being.

570
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:12,320
As a theologian named Killick, who never mind, you don't need to know that, who sort of did this thing which I'm doing, sort of mapped the Heidegger and Christianity together.

571
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:21,039
So, but anyway, so there's the Father, and he's there in the background, underlying the understanding of being, and he's invisible.

572
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:23,039
And what does the Son do?

573
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:24,640
That is Jesus.

574
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:29,039
Well, He's the exemplar, He's the work of art.

575
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:38,960
He can embody the truth that you can't see or know because it's all pervasive in the background.

576
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,120
And He can hold it up to you.

577
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:46,000
And then that's why He can say, He who has seen me has seen the Father.

578
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:49,520
And He can claim to be rightly.

579
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:53,760
See, all this crazy talk stops being crazy talk.

580
00:58:53,759 --> 00:58:57,039
If you map it into this, it may be a lot more things.

581
00:58:57,039 --> 00:58:59,600
And for Christians, I'm sure it is a lot more things.

582
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:07,200
But at least Jesus can say that He was in the world and the world was made through Him.

583
00:59:07,199 --> 00:59:08,880
Why can He say that?

584
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:15,439
Because any articulating or reconfiguring work of art is a thing in the world.

585
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:19,920
It's a temple or a person or a speech or a philosophy book or something.

586
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:32,240
And it creates the world, remember, by giving you the Homeric world, or the Athenian world, or the Roman world, and now the Christian world.

587
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:37,039
So, the creator of the world, in that sense, the creator, not the producer.

588
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:44,440
So, you couldn't, if you try to think about God as how something could both produce the world and be in it, doesn't make any sense at all.

589
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:53,960
So, you better not have this producer of God is just a mixed up thing, anyway, of the Romans sort of being squashed with the Hebrews.

590
00:59:54,599 --> 01:00:08,360
But if you don't have a producer God of that sort, if you think God is a creator and that it makes the meaning, it makes meaning, not stuff, and then Jesus makes these new meanings.

591
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:17,880
So, he's in the world, and he creates the world, and it's made through him, and it's sort of the result of his shining.

592
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:22,440
He is the light, remember, that John keeps saying, that he's shining in the world.

593
01:00:22,759 --> 01:00:33,960
And as he shines in the world, people show up as something which we have, which as we don't have any names for them, we will have saints and sinners.

594
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:38,600
I mean, a whole different understanding of what human beings are.

595
01:00:38,599 --> 01:00:42,440
No more heroes, no more loyal citizens.

596
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:46,680
That's not what you are if you're one of these early Christians.

597
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:55,000
You are in this special light that Jesus is shining on everything.

598
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,719
Okay, let me see.

599
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,640
Anybody want to say anything?

600
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,639
This is not a sermon, you know.

601
01:00:59,639 --> 01:01:02,840
You can raise your hand and interrupt.

602
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:04,680
Disagree.

603
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,199
Nobody's walking out.

604
01:01:06,199 --> 01:01:07,319
That's a good sign.

605
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:11,880
I mean, sometimes people think this is just too outrageous to leave.

606
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:12,839
I can understand that.

607
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:13,480
Yes.

608
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:15,800
Now you've got to talk louder.

609
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:17,720
Phil can't hear you.

610
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:18,719
Seven, yeah?

611
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,319
Good question.

612
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:32,079
He's asking, I don't want to talk about it much.

613
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:37,520
We have to talk about it in office hours, but I'll make a stab if I can say it in a way that fits with what I've been saying.

614
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:48,880
In Kierkegaard, Kierkegaard has this mixture of philosophy and Christianity, which is very interesting.

615
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:58,480
And he's got this strong view, and it's related to what I've been saying, and I mentioned it, that God is just invisible in Christianity.

616
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,480
There's no way to relate to God.

617
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:06,800
And that's because Jesus is now shining invisible, and Christians relate to Jesus.

618
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:10,960
How they relate to Jesus is what's paradoxical.

619
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,799
And that's what he's asking about.

620
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:30,880
What's paradoxical is Christians, according to Kierkegaard, build the whole meaning of their life and their eternal salvation, which I don't think I want to try to explain right now, build it all in their total devotion to Jesus.

621
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:37,839
In the part you read, remember Jesus says that we would all die for each other, and he would die for the disciples, and the disciples would die for him.

622
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:42,000
That is, have something in your life so important that you would die for it.

623
01:02:42,000 --> 01:03:01,599
And what's paradoxical is that there is this seemingly vulnerable human being, this person, who, for the Christians, has this specific meaning that they have what Kierkegaard calls an infinite passion.

624
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:05,280
I mean, they build the whole meaning of their life on the relation to Jesus.

625
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:20,520
And what's paradoxical is that anybody would build the whole meaning of their life and think that anything could be so absolutely important, which is just something that happened at some point in time, at some place in time, to some guy.

626
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:23,240
But we've got to go into that in Philosophy 7.

627
01:03:23,239 --> 01:03:39,399
But you could manage to make what I'm saying seem a lot more paradoxical than I'm making it if you throw in the relation of the Christian to Jesus and claim that it is this absolute commitment, which sounds right, and Jesus is asking for that.

628
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,280
And Kierkegaard is on to something very important.

629
01:03:42,280 --> 01:04:09,399
He thinks that Christianity not only invented or introduced, or whatever you want to say, the idea that the ultimate meaning could be embodied in a human body, but he introduced the idea that you could have this kind of total, unconditional, absolute commitment to some human body.

630
01:04:09,719 --> 01:04:15,159
Now, I'm getting way ahead of the story, but you'll see that Dante's already got this.

631
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:18,520
Don't have to wait to see if Kierkegaard makes it seem more paradoxical.

632
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:25,480
But Dante's already got the idea that the Savior, and Jesus is the Savior somehow.

633
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:42,440
What he's saving people from and how he's saving them is complicated, but we could say roughly he's saving them from despair and boredom of the Roman Empire, really, by giving them a life of eternal excitement and ecstatic meaning.

634
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,520
They're very much alive, he keeps saying.

635
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:51,480
If you follow me, you will be super alive and you'll be alive forever, whatever forever comes to me.

636
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:55,440
And that's forgotten what I was saying.

637
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,160
I want to.

638
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:57,119
Just a second.

639
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,279
Tell me what I was saying.

640
01:04:54,360 --> 01:05:00,559
You're good at telling me.

641
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:02,239
No, that's too hard.

642
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:05,279
We'd have to listen to the iPod to find out.

643
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,120
But let me try.

644
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:11,599
So I'm trying to explain the Kierkegaard thing.

645
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:29,360
I'm trying to explain the unconditional commitment, ah, yeah, through that you can have not only that, that the God can become flesh and shine, but that there is something in the world worthy of total devotion as if it were a God.

646
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,120
And that makes it a God.

647
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:34,640
Because whatever is the object of total devotion is a God.

648
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:39,280
And that's Kierkegaard's way of putting the same thing I'm saying.

649
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:48,480
Jesus is God because he says, or it's right for him to say that you can have a total devotion to me.

650
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,000
You can adore me.

651
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:55,839
You can take me as the ultimate meaning of the world and of your life.

652
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:00,880
And if you do that, you will be saved.

653
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:13,199
Oh, I remember what I was saying now, from despair, from boredom, and given us a life that is totally meaningful and absolutely ecstatic and just the opposite of what the Romans did.

654
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,600
Now, anything else?

655
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:18,160
Okay, I think I want to go a little further.

656
01:06:18,159 --> 01:06:20,559
Yeah, let's do the Holy Spirit anyway.

657
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,879
Because I've only got these two lectures, so where are we now?

658
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:27,520
So he's a reconfigurer.

659
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:50,999
When he says, he who has seen me has seen the Father, you can now understand that as he who has seen me has seen a glamorized, glorified example of the understanding of being and the background practices, such that they remain invisible, the background practices, but they now become incarnate.

660
01:06:50,999 --> 01:07:01,239
Jesus manages to show the meaning of the whole intelligible order of the universe in his way of life.

661
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:06,360
So he has, and when you see that, you see the meaning of the universe.

662
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:06,999
Yeah.

663
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:08,280
Ah, good.

664
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,280
That's really sort of for next time.

665
01:07:10,839 --> 01:07:12,759
And so you won't find this mysterious.

666
01:07:12,759 --> 01:07:16,999
That the Hebrew background practices were obey the law.

667
01:07:16,999 --> 01:07:22,599
And you'll find Jesus talking about that and how the law was very important until he came along.

668
01:07:22,599 --> 01:07:28,839
And if you want to remember, I said if you want to overthrow a culture, you've got to make what's very central to the culture marginal.

669
01:07:28,839 --> 01:07:38,839
And that's what, that's what, and the background practices were all concerned with being righteous, and being righteous was doing what the command, what Moses and the commandments told you to do.

670
01:07:38,839 --> 01:07:46,440
And if you did that, then your life was, you were a good person, a righteous person, and if you didn't do that, you were a bad person.

671
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:54,440
And the main thing was, and so it was definitely very important to know the law, obey the law, keep the Sabbath.

672
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:57,959
And if you read carefully, you'll see that Jesus is going to stop doing all that.

673
01:07:58,679 --> 01:08:00,119
That's the right question.

674
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:06,679
The question left you, I won't tell you, and then you'll never figure it out, I'm afraid, because it took me about 20 years.

675
01:08:06,679 --> 01:08:22,039
What's the marginal practice in the Hebrew story that Jesus can manage to keep when he dumps the law and builds a whole new religion and a whole new understanding of being and a whole new understanding of what it is to be a human being around?

676
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:23,400
That's for next time.

677
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,360
I'm going to stay here on this for a minute.

678
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:27,440
So he's seen the Father.

679
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:40,159
People see what they should do in the light of his actions, his parables, his shining, his showing that he's the truth and the way.

680
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:42,480
He isn't telling them the truth and the way.

681
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:45,679
He's showing them the truth and the way to live.

682
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:48,239
And now that's the Holy Spirit.

683
01:08:48,240 --> 01:09:03,199
The Holy Spirit is something that will be left after Jesus is gone, which will enable them to go on living in the light of his shining.

684
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:10,719
And so in 1264, you get him talking about the paraclete.

685
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:15,679
The paraclete is the Latin that gets translated, is it Latin or Greek?

686
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:22,480
It's Greek, the Greek that gets translated Holy Spirit, with the first column on 1264 in the middle.

687
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:33,679
I have said these things to you while still with you, but the Paraclete, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything and remind you of all that I have said to you.

688
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:40,879
That is, Jesus is saying, after I'm gone, how are you going to know what to do?

689
01:09:40,879 --> 01:09:50,559
And he's saying that if you have the right relation to him, you will experience in every situation, so to speak, what Jesus would do and do it.

690
01:09:50,559 --> 01:09:53,279
And that is what he's going to send you.

691
01:09:53,280 --> 01:10:02,400
He's going to send you the sense of how to live in each situation the way Jesus would do it.

692
01:10:02,959 --> 01:10:05,440
And let me see, I find one other place.

693
01:10:05,839 --> 01:10:07,599
166.

694
01:10:07,599 --> 01:10:09,400
Well, not much there.

695
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:11,480
Okay, well, that's enough for that.

696
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,159
And if you do that, you'll be filled with joy.

697
01:10:08,959 --> 01:10:16,280
Now, let me have one more minute here, and I will caught up where I want to be.

698
01:10:17,559 --> 01:10:18,839
Okay, I think.

699
01:10:18,839 --> 01:10:37,719
So the Holy Spirit is that what you get when you are able to bring your relationship to Jesus, who is now taking the place of God, and do what it is that He wants you to do.

700
01:10:37,719 --> 01:10:45,639
And you will be able to sense in each situation, without any law to guide you anymore, what it is you're supposed to do.

701
01:10:45,639 --> 01:10:48,119
And you can get it in one commandment.

702
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:52,119
I'll just you know this if you're Christians already.

703
01:10:52,120 --> 01:11:01,799
You're supposed to love, and you're supposed to love your neighbor, and you're supposed to, and that love's going to take all sorts of different forms.

704
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:09,639
It can be tough love, and it can be tender love, and it can be erotic love, presumably, though they don't talk about that.

705
01:11:09,959 --> 01:11:22,440
And you will know, if you're a Christian and related to Jesus, what it is that you are required to do in each situation, and there won't be any law covering it.

706
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:25,159
It'll be just different in every situation.

707
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:31,079
And that's the Holy Spirit that's telling, well, will be guiding you when Jesus is gone.

708
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:48,520
Okay, now the good questions for next time is how he reconfigures the practices, what he uses to flip everything around, and what it is like to be uh live like a uh a a trans uh a reconfigured person in in in in that world.
