1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,360
But I found something in reading Homer that I thought was so much sort of fun for me anyway, and so interesting and surprising that I have to talk about it for a minute.

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:38,319
In all the years that I've taught the Odyssey and told people to, you know, point out the exceptions and challenge my theory, and now that I'm even writing a paper on the special way that Helen is open to Aphrodite and how Homer calls that, you know, she's peerless among women, then on 436, nobody else got to 436.

3
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,039
In the middle of 436, you probably don't have the Odyssey with you anymore, but I'll read it.

4
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:51,839
Helen of Argos, daughter of Zeus and Leta, would she have joined the stranger, lain with him, if she had known her destiny?

5
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,600
This is Penelope talking to Odysse in their bedroom when he's finally home.

6
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,879
No one, the Achaeans in arms, would bring her back to her own country.

7
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:13,039
Surely a goddess moved her to adultery, her blood unchilled by war and evil coming, the desolation, and so forth.

8
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:17,759
Does that strike you as a counter example to what I said?

9
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,279
It sure does me.

10
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,439
I was really upset about it.

11
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,639
It sounds like it's saying that she is not a good person.

12
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,119
She's an adulterer.

13
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,319
There's another place which says the war is her fault, but that turned out to mean that she caused the war.

14
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:39,879
I don't mind that, because the question is whether she caused the war shows that she's a bad person or not.

15
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:42,279
And I want to say, no, she's not a bad person.

16
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,360
She's peerless among women.

17
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,519
She's somebody that Agamemnon is still very happy to be married to.

18
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:50,920
But this says she's just bad.

19
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,360
And I couldn't figure out what to do with it.

20
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,079
And I looked at the Greek, and the Greek didn't help.

21
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:02,920
It says something very similar, so similar that I hardly have to read it.

22
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:10,840
It says, in her case, a god prompted her to work a shameful deed, nor until then, and so forth and so forth.

23
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,119
That's enough.

24
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:14,280
So then I really got worried.

25
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:21,559
And I looked across the page from the English to the Greek, and lo and behold, there's a footnote.

26
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:27,719
These lines were rejected by Aristocratus and can hardly be defended in this context.

27
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,920
That means that the people who are sort of the editor.

28
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,560
I looked up Aristocratus in Wikipedia.

29
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:56,920
He turns out to have lived at 220 BC and be the most influential of all the scholars of Homeric poetry and wrote the, did the first important edition of Homer, and well, the first most historically important critical edition of Homer, which had presumably this footnote.

30
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:17,920
Because I knew, and this is the interesting part, that early on people lost touch with this Homeric picture, that you obey the gods and the moods no matter what awful things happen to everybody, because being open to these highest authorities that give most meaning to your life is the highest thing you can do.

31
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:31,519
And I read that already at the time of the Athenians, they couldn't believe it anymore, and they would rewrite the Odyssey, making her punished for the bad things and saying bad things about her.

32
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,719
Well, here it is.

33
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,519
There it is.

34
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:42,399
Somebody early on rewrote these ten lines to just make clear what a bad person she was.

35
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:43,600
And I'm so happy.

36
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,200
I'm so happy because it didn't shoot down my view.

37
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,439
And it even confirms the view that this Homeric way of looking at things is very strange.

38
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,799
And the Athenians already, that is the time of Aeschylus, wouldn't have looked at it this way.

39
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:16,079
And maybe they would be tempted, apparently they were tempted, to simply write a few bad things in there about Helen so that we don't get the mistaken idea that it's a good idea to just run off if you're shined on by the goddess of erotic love.

40
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,360
Okay, so that's all.

41
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,999
I'm surprised nobody saw it.

42
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:23,040
I'm surprised that when I saw it, it was okay.

43
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,719
And now I'm ready to go back to Aeschylus.

44
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,400
Okay, so here's where we were.

45
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:50,639
That Artemis, not wanting to see young people or animals hurt, sees the war as a terrible thing and decides she's going to stop the war by insisting that Agamemnon can't go to war if he doesn't sacrifice Ephigenia.

46
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,519
Remember, his daughter.

47
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,439
That's where we were last time.

48
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,879
And then it turned.

49
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,119
And then, so she does that.

50
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:05,879
And the amazing thing is, to her, from her point of view, I'm sure, that Agamemnon doesn't just give up and go home.

51
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:40,759
In fact, Agamemnon gets terribly upset because he knows that as a king who's got his armies to deploy and who's got all of them out there on this island of Aulus, which is sort of just outside the harbor of Argos, and where they can't get any further because there isn't any wind, he got them out there, and he's got to do something to carry on his job as king and leader to get them fighting.

52
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:45,400
Where they are, they're starving, and that's terrible.

53
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:52,839
So, and moreover, Aeschylus doesn't make any big deal of it, but he mentions oaths every once in a while.

54
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:56,200
He has, I don't see it in here, but maybe I missed it.

55
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:05,239
But the story is that Agamemnon has sworn an oath to Menelaus that if anything bad happens to him, Agamemnon will help out and vice versa.

56
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,959
And something bad happened to Menelaus indeed.

57
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,360
Paris ran off with Helen.

58
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:21,799
And so both out of as a promise keeper and as a king, or maybe three things, and as a general, he's got to fight the war.

59
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:30,520
But as a father who loves his daughter, he absolutely doesn't want to fight the war.

60
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:33,400
What do you think is going to happen?

61
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:52,879
Well, it looks like Artemis thinks, well, rationality will trump, feelings of fathers must be the strongest thing, and that trumps all these rational stories about what kings do and generals do and promise keeping.

62
00:06:52,879 --> 00:07:02,639
That's what she thinks, but that isn't what he thinks, because he's not what turns out it's important that he's a man and she's a woman.

63
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,559
She puts feelings first.

64
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:06,960
We'll have to see what he does finally.

65
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,920
But whatever it is, things are in a terrible mess.

66
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,199
That's where we ended.

67
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:22,719
If he doesn't kill Ephijaniah, there's a big disaster for him as king and general and brother and promise keeper.

68
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:31,600
If he does kill Ephijaniah, there's a big disaster for him as father who loves his daughter, and he's going to get in trouble for that.

69
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:37,199
So, and that's where we stand.

70
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:49,920
Now, before we can go back to talking about what he finally did and what happened when he did it, which you presumably have now read it and know, there's lots of backgrounds you need to have.

71
00:07:49,920 --> 00:08:01,440
Because I already was, couldn't even say as much as I've said already without beginning to lay out a whole thing about the two kinds of gods.

72
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:12,800
And the two, the gods aren't anymore personifications or focuses or shining examples, is my way of talking about it, shining paradigms of moods.

73
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:17,120
The gods are now cultural forces.

74
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:27,480
There are two value systems in the culture, and they are represented by the two sets of gods.

75
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,440
I don't think people think the gods really act anymore.

76
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:33,639
I don't think they really think people see the gods anymore.

77
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:49,160
But that's a way of expressing something that's very powerful and very real, namely the two sets of values that enable people to make sense of what they do.

78
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:59,239
And Aeschylus sets up this battle between the Olympian gods on the one hand and the Furies on the other.

79
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,760
That structures the whole book.

80
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:26,519
Now, now that you read it, I want to put on the board, with your help, because every year some new conflict comes out, all the different ways that Aeschylus has of talking about this conflict between the two sets of gods or values in the culture, because it's all over the place.

81
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:39,560
You can't really crack the complicated crossword puzzle that this is without constantly keeping track of which set of gods are we talking about and what are they doing.

82
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:49,720
So we've got on the one hand, we've got the Furies, and on the other hand, we've got the Olympian gods, the Olympians, we'll call them.

83
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,160
Now, what do you give me examples of what goes over here?

84
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:58,040
What gets associated with the Furies?

85
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:00,600
And contrasted.

86
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,440
I already had to give one.

87
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:03,960
What did I, or give two, really?

88
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,560
What did I say a while back?

89
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,480
What are the two forces around whether to kill a Fijiania or not?

90
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:21,360
Well, there's Artemis on the one hand, and female, exactly.

91
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:29,200
There's the females, or let's say women, and over here, the men.

92
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,000
That's a big contrast.

93
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:33,679
And what else did I say?

94
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:39,360
What's the main way that women sort of react to things according to this picture?

95
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:52,079
By the way, these are super stereotypes, but this is, I mean, after all, what, 2,500 years ago, we've gone a long way maybe, but try to see how it looks to Aeschylus.

96
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,720
What's the defining feature of women?

97
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,280
Yeah.

98
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,960
Feeling, yeah.

99
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,960
And of men, you must know.

100
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,880
Rationality, yes.

101
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,040
I think something a little narrow, I mean, a little less fancy.

102
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,480
There is a God for rationality, all right.

103
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,159
We'll get to him in a minute.

104
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:14,239
Just put thinking over here.

105
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:14,960
Okay.

106
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:16,800
Now it gets fancier.

107
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:17,759
Think some more.

108
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:23,120
Well, how else do they get contrasted in really surprising ways?

109
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,920
Surely somebody's noticed.

110
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:28,879
How are they related to sort of geography?

111
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:31,360
How are they related to light?

112
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,720
How are they related to all sorts of things?

113
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,440
Let's say sort of geography, yeah.

114
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,319
The ground and the sky.

115
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,920
Yeah, I think I'll call it Earth, but I'm not disagreeing.

116
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:47,519
Earth over, no, yeah, Earth here, right.

117
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,880
And sky god.

118
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,200
These are the sky gods.

119
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,400
Okay, how about just in the in the history?

120
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:05,399
How do they view themselves, each of them, in terms of the temporality, in terms of the time that they come from or go care about?

121
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:08,840
Yeah, that's right.

122
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,199
The Furies are old.

123
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,720
They're aged children.

124
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,999
And if Aeschylus says, I don't want to try to find the passage.

125
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:19,400
They're aged children because they have been around a long, long time.

126
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:25,639
They've been around so long that they go back to primitive responses, so they behave like children.

127
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:29,160
And they are the old gods.

128
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:38,200
And these are the new gods who have come in by the time you get to Homer, both are around.

129
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:45,400
And Homer, this is just, I keep saying this, is reading the gods sort of out of the story.

130
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,480
I found five places in all of the Odyssey where Homer mentions the Furies.

131
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,920
And very much in passing, and almost as if by accident.

132
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,600
If you find more, let me know.

133
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:02,360
If you find places where he really takes any serious notice of the Furies, I would be shocked.

134
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:09,079
And I would hope to find that it was this critic read it out of them.

135
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,560
Right.

136
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:12,759
Man, going back to the Olympians.

137
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:13,480
What does that mean?

138
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,120
Do you think that there's godlike men and women?

139
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:17,960
And that the Olympians are quoted.

140
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:23,640
I don't think, except for Zeus, which is, of course, a special case.

141
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:24,280
I don't know.

142
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:24,999
We have to look.

143
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:27,480
I don't think the Olympians are ever quoted by women.

144
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,360
We'd have to find out.

145
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,640
That would be very interesting.

146
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,960
And it would surprise me.

147
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:38,520
There are women, obviously, among the Olympians, but it's interesting what happens there.

148
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,520
You don't hear about Hera.

149
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:45,039
You don't hear about Aphrodite, you hear about Athena and Artemis.

150
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,640
What's interesting about those two women is that they're sort of men-women.

151
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,200
Both of them are virgins.

152
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:57,119
Athena carries a spear.

153
00:13:58,239 --> 00:14:00,399
Artemis has a bow and arrow.

154
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,360
What else?

155
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,800
They're very androgynous types.

156
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,080
And that's important.

157
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:16,960
It turns out that it's very important that Athena is able to understand the Furies with her woman side more than Apollo.

158
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,679
The real man in it is Apollo.

159
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,480
He's pure.

160
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,560
I'll read you a quote in a minute.

161
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,399
Pure rationality.

162
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,680
That's what I was saving.

163
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,919
For he's even more rational than thinking.

164
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,080
He's a rationalist, but I'll explain that in a minute.

165
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:44,160
But so I think that even the women among the Olympian gods are being played down by Homer, except for Athena, really.

166
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:49,040
And she's very important because she's not really like a woman.

167
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,799
She's not born of a woman either.

168
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,840
She's born out of Zeus's head.

169
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,239
She's very, as unwoman as you can get.

170
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,440
Okay, did somebody, did I see a hand up over there?

171
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,720
Because what I did?

172
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,680
Yeah.

173
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,039
Okay.

174
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,600
I thought you were getting a story with my.

175
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,440
Hmm.

176
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,920
Because she's this funny mixture.

177
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,440
Only we don't see any mixture.

178
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:17,999
You're right.

179
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:20,480
Artemis is a funny one.

180
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,040
She is she one of the Olympians?

181
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:24,880
That's the next question.

182
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:27,160
She's certainly not one of the furies.

183
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,999
But where's my chart?

184
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:33,160
Anybody got their chart of the Olympians that I handed out a while back?

185
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:34,600
I don't think, I'm not sure.

186
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,200
I don't know whether Artemis is on it or not.

187
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,880
I'm a feeling she is.

188
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:41,159
But before I go out and make a whole speech about it, I better know.

189
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:41,720
Yeah.

190
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:45,640
And Paulo's kid sister, twin sister.

191
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,000
Is she on the chart?

192
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:49,480
Okay.

193
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,559
So we got a problem with Artemis.

194
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,119
That's good.

195
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:53,239
It's good to have problems.

196
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:55,720
You learn things when you've got a problem.

197
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,960
She definitely is into feelings.

198
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:02,119
That's why she thought that Agamemnon wouldn't kill a Piginia.

199
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:13,720
That's why she gets upset at the rabbit that gets eaten, whose babies get eaten by the eagles and so forth.

200
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:24,360
And it's important, certainly, that she is a woman, but there's something about it that doesn't fit.

201
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,960
I don't know what to say.

202
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,360
Yeah.

203
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,160
Yes.

204
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,439
But oh, oh, wait, well, Orestes.

205
00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:35,799
He comes back to avenge his mother's death.

206
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,680
You are way, not wrong at all.

207
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:40,600
You're way ahead of the story.

208
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:47,959
The question is going to be over Orestes, and this is for the libation bearers, which you're going to be reading next week, not yet.

209
00:16:48,760 --> 00:17:05,479
The whole cliffhanger of the libation bearers, which has the audience and the chorus on the edge of their seats, and will you too when you understand what's happening, is whether Orestes is going to kill his mother in the name of the Furies or in the name of the new gods?

210
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:09,560
Because they've gone against both.

211
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,679
And the important thing is he better behave.

212
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,600
Well, let's wait and see.

213
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:19,199
And which one would we want him to do it in the name of?

214
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,080
And why?

215
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,119
And does he?

216
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,480
All those are the questions to put aside.

217
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,600
His question, I have to just say, I don't know what to think.

218
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:36,719
And it's funny, I never faced it, even though I knew that she's that there's a woman among the Olympians.

219
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:42,320
All I can say is she doesn't have an important part.

220
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:59,279
The only people who have important parts are people, I mean gods, Olympian gods, are Apollo, who's super, super male, and Athena, who makes a point of saying that she's man and woman both.

221
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,519
And other than that, there's only Zeus.

222
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,719
And Zeus is sort of above being man or woman.

223
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:10,159
So I don't have more to say about it.

224
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:10,560
Yeah.

225
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:25,040
Saturn Nestor says the Argonauts are going to kill Agamemnon because he killed our daughter.

226
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,239
That's good.

227
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:28,000
Beatrice is right.

228
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,799
I mean, the important thing is where the Furies stand in this.

229
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:47,439
And it's in the name of the Furies that people go around killing or killing, or the Clytemnestra says that it's in the name of her daughter's fury that she's going to kill Agamemnon.

230
00:18:47,439 --> 00:18:57,879
And that's so that's and that's a way of saying Artemis just comes in for a tiny cameo part at the beginning to demand this sacrifice because that's probably already in the myths.

231
00:18:57,879 --> 00:18:59,399
I'm sure it must be.

232
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:08,040
And it's not fitting very well in Aeschylus' picture, but he drops her right away, and then we don't hear about her again.

233
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:13,399
Okay, so the big contrast, though, somebody we had old and new.

234
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:15,799
Yeah, well that's still right.

235
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:18,920
Let me go back to earth and sky for a minute.

236
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:20,760
Why should they be in there?

237
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:25,639
Well, because earth is local.

238
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:38,360
It's got to do both with fertility and it's got to do with, I think it's sort of interesting that the earth is always some particular earth that you're on.

239
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,840
But the sky is universal.

240
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,320
Everybody's under the same sky.

241
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:52,199
But in a certain sense, they aren't really all, you could say they're all standing on the same earth, but somehow they're standing on the same earth by standing in a different place.

242
00:19:52,199 --> 00:19:55,159
But they're all just playing under the same sky.

243
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:57,479
I think that's how Aeschylus thinks about it.

244
00:19:57,479 --> 00:20:00,679
And he certainly lines them up that way.

245
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,360
And so let's go on dark and light.

246
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,600
What goes with dark and light that we haven't got here yet?

247
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,439
When do the furies do their deeds?

248
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:13,480
And when do the high gods do their deeds?

249
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,879
The furies do their deeds in the dark.

250
00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:18,520
They're always in the dark, under the ground.

251
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:20,119
I have quotes about that.

252
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,360
Let's see if I can find one.

253
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:25,799
Let's try page 48.

254
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:33,239
Yes, at the top of the bottom of 48, it talks about there lurks in the hooded night terror.

255
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,520
The gods fail not, the gods there are the furies, fail not to mark those who have killed many.

256
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:46,000
The black fury, stalking man, fortunate beyond all right, wrench back, that is, somebody who gets away with killing.

257
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:47,440
That would be the fortunate against all right.

258
00:20:48,719 --> 00:20:54,639
Wrench back against, again, the set of his life and drop him to darkness, and so forth.

259
00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:57,440
So that, yeah, the furies are always in the dark.

260
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,199
You'll hear more about that.

261
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:01,360
And the sky gods are in the light.

262
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,999
They're the gods, again, I don't think I can just open to it.

263
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,919
They're the gods of the marketplace.

264
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,679
I used to think that was strange.

265
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,159
What that means is they're the gods sort of out in the open in the daytime.

266
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,479
They show up and interact with people.

267
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:18,959
They don't just reach out and sort of drag them down into the dark.

268
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:26,399
And tying up with the earth and the sky and the day and the night, we haven't got day and night.

269
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:30,159
These are the day, this is the night.

270
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:36,000
And that's very closely related to another version, which is the dark and the light.

271
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:41,439
I don't think you'll say it because it seems to me in a certain way I've already said it.

272
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:43,360
Okay, what else have we got?

273
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:48,879
Oh, and I just said something about the local and the universal.

274
00:21:48,879 --> 00:21:52,000
This is the local, and this is the universal.

275
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,360
I haven't shown that yet.

276
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,600
I'll show you right now.

277
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:16,560
The person who speaks, or the god, that is, who speaks most for the new gods, and I keep saying he's the real super male of the bunch in that he represents what the new gods are most good at and most different.

278
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,360
Yeah.

279
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,039
Did I get him on the wrong side?

280
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,919
Oh, I did.

281
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:22,560
Let's see.

282
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,799
Dark, local, universal, dark.

283
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:25,760
Oh, yeah.

284
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,560
Thanks.

285
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,600
That's not a good idea, is it?

286
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,320
So these are the night people, or I keep calling them people.

287
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,879
You understand that they're gods.

288
00:22:35,879 --> 00:22:37,479
Okay, night.

289
00:22:37,479 --> 00:22:42,039
And over here, of course, are the daywives.

290
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:47,959
Apollo of all is, after all, still a kind of sun god.

291
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:54,999
But what he really is now is what I'm going to call the kind of enlightenment fanatic before his time.

292
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,080
I mean, he has no respect for feeling or the local at all.

293
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:08,199
All he thinks about is sort of this detached, universal truths.

294
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:10,280
This is clear on 157.

295
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:15,239
I have to jump way back there to the speech of Apollo.

296
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,480
To you, established by Athena in your power, I shall speak justly.

297
00:23:19,479 --> 00:23:21,080
Then he tells you who he is.

298
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,280
I am a prophet.

299
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,799
I shall not lie.

300
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,759
Never for man, woman, nor city.

301
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,959
I mean, no partiality, not even for Athens.

302
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:39,560
Never for man, woman, nor city, for my throne of prophecy, have I spoken a word except that which Zeus, father of Olympians, might command.

303
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,840
This is justice.

304
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,080
Recognize how great its strength.

305
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:53,639
This is just to say I'm completely honest, not at all devious, always ready to see and tell the truth, and it's the same truth for everybody.

306
00:23:53,639 --> 00:24:03,080
I have no partiality, and that's the most important thing for the new gods, and that's the powerful new idea that the new gods have.

307
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,119
And so we have to we have that in there.

308
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:15,600
Fairness, universality, and rationality versus what is over here, sort of partiality.

309
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:16,720
I called it local here.

310
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:20,399
Maybe I should call it, well, local is okay.

311
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:30,399
And along with the local goes, I'll see how I can make this, see if anybody can understand, see this.

312
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,959
Who will be the god or goddess or whatever of the family?

313
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:40,879
Which, come on, you must know.

314
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,479
Well, come on, this is hopeless.

315
00:24:42,479 --> 00:24:44,560
If you don't know that, that's very bad.

316
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:49,600
Which are families, universal or local?

317
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:50,719
Local.

318
00:24:50,719 --> 00:24:51,919
Families, yes.

319
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:58,639
The furies are for families and blood relatives and everything local like that.

320
00:24:58,639 --> 00:25:08,159
So when anybody does anything to anybody in your family, you get back at them by appealing to the furies who then attack the other family.

321
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,360
This is a very un-Apollonian way to do things.

322
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:21,520
So their family, they're also called hearth sometimes, goddesses of the hearth, which is the focus of the family, the fireplace in French.

323
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,919
It is foyer, which means focus.

324
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,280
So they're going to be the gods of the family and the hearth.

325
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,480
And over here, what's the opposite of family, I wonder?

326
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:31,439
What did I have?

327
00:25:31,439 --> 00:25:33,039
Oh, strangers, of course.

328
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,639
This is the god of strangers.

329
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,879
This is one of the ways that it's still related to Zeus.

330
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:47,279
Only in an odd way, Zeus is, oh, that's sort of confusing, really.

331
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:54,959
Zeus protects the family, but he doesn't protect, he protects.

332
00:25:55,199 --> 00:25:57,000
See, I told you last time, it's odd.

333
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:03,800
Zeus doesn't protect strangers anymore because Aeschylus doesn't really understand anything about going from world to world.

334
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:05,639
That's not his thing.

335
00:26:05,959 --> 00:26:17,320
And he doesn't, and it's not a pirate culture anymore where people come from other worlds and tell you their story and that you try to be a good host to them and they better not do anything bad to you.

336
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,879
So Zeus was against what Paris did because he was a bad guest.

337
00:26:21,879 --> 00:26:26,840
Well, now Zeus is the protector of the hosts from the guests.

338
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:36,759
But he's protector of them as hosts, not as families, not as hearth, but something much more, I don't know, masculine and abstract.

339
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,560
Yeah.

340
00:26:37,879 --> 00:26:38,760
His what?

341
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:39,959
The hearth.

342
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:40,840
Yeah, Hestia.

343
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,039
And which, and is she one of the ones on Olympus?

344
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,280
I hope not, but she might be.

345
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:48,999
She's on what list?

346
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,119
My godless?

347
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:50,919
Uh-oh.

348
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:53,560
She's the goddess of the hearth.

349
00:26:55,639 --> 00:26:56,600
I wonder.

350
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,879
I'm going to erase it, but I have to think about it.

351
00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:02,119
Certainly, let's put it this way.

352
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:05,879
This is the question of blood relatives.

353
00:27:06,439 --> 00:27:08,600
I will worry about later.

354
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,719
Is that how you spell blood?

355
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,999
It looks funny.

356
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,480
Okay.

357
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,560
Okay, the blood relatives over here and strangers over here.

358
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:22,519
Let me write hearth over here as something I don't understand where it goes.

359
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,319
And I don't really understand where Artemis goes.

360
00:27:25,639 --> 00:27:29,719
Somebody who will help me out someday and tell me.

361
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,639
So did we do already?

362
00:27:31,639 --> 00:27:32,600
We did pass.

363
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,280
What did we do about the old?

364
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,600
Old and new is fine.

365
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,719
Another one is tradition.

366
00:27:40,719 --> 00:27:43,279
They're for tradition.

367
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,439
And these people are for progress.

368
00:27:41,879 --> 00:27:49,119
The question is whether being new is a good thing or a bad thing.

369
00:27:49,439 --> 00:27:52,960
These gods say being new is just a bad thing.

370
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,600
Things were fine in the good old days, which is what we stood for.

371
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,080
These gods say we're new and we're progress.

372
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,279
We get beyond your old-fashioned, archaic, childish tradition.

373
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:05,840
Yeah.

374
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,360
What's that?

375
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:10,240
Oh, wow.

376
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,080
Wow, was that an important question?

377
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,840
I thought I just said something about it, but I think you're right, I haven't.

378
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,040
She's asking, is Homer before or after the Orestea?

379
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,679
Homer is way before the Orestea.

380
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,399
I had that in here.

381
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,440
I wonder what happened to him.

382
00:28:23,439 --> 00:28:25,360
I didn't say anything about that, did I?

383
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:26,879
Or did I?

384
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:28,239
Oh, yeah, the timeline is there.

385
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:37,439
But wait, I mean, just let me say, Homer was written down 500 years before the time of the Athenian Greeks.

386
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:43,039
And the Homeric Greeks were already something like 300 years in the past.

387
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,999
I think it is.

388
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,239
You can look it up on Wikipedia or someplace.

389
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,159
Before Homer was written down.

390
00:28:48,879 --> 00:28:50,479
It was an oral culture.

391
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:54,639
And that oral culture was the culture in which there was Agamemnon and so forth.

392
00:28:54,639 --> 00:29:04,719
And it really was there because archaeologists, I don't actually tell you this, really finally dug up Troy and dug up the palace of Agamemnon and so forth.

393
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:14,879
It really was a long, long, but it was it was as far away in the past from Aeschylus as the medieval time is from us.

394
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:17,600
It was just literally another world.

395
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,519
So and I'm glad you asked.

396
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,560
Yeah.

397
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,360
Yeah.

398
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:22,959
Ah, good, good.

399
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:24,159
Yes, she's asking.

400
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:32,919
So, how come it looks like the Furies are, where Homer is focusing on the Olympian gods, even though he's older?

401
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:34,199
Well, good point.

402
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:35,800
The Furies are even older.

403
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:42,439
The Furies go way back to the beginning of the culture, even before the beginning of the culture, way before.

404
00:29:42,439 --> 00:29:55,159
Because the Furies are born of the blood when Cronus castrated Uranus and all these big, weird battles between the very, very, very old gods.

405
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:57,480
So the Furies have been around sort of forever.

406
00:29:57,479 --> 00:30:00,119
They're practically like animal instincts.

407
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:20,199
They protect women in the sense that they protect their family and their blood offspring ferociously against any outside intrusions, the way animals do.

408
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:30,600
I mean, in my own backyard, I saw a deer attack my big dog because the dog got between the deer and the baby deer, which I didn't know was there.

409
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,240
So a pretty amazing sight.

410
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:39,080
The dog became so afraid of deer that he was traumatized for the rest of his life.

411
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,799
But anyway, so who had a hand up over here?

412
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,480
No, it's all from the text.

413
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:49,480
Everything is in here somewhere in some chorus speech or other.

414
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:54,199
As we go through it, I'll give you the sort of page numbers where it happens.

415
00:30:54,199 --> 00:31:04,999
So there's the tradition, okay, and progress and feeling and thinking, and you defend the nest or the home or the family and so forth.

416
00:31:04,999 --> 00:31:08,119
There's no sense of fairness or universal rights.

417
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:10,759
Everybody should be defending their own home.

418
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:20,799
I mean, I wrote down here because when I was in high school, I guess, there was this whole thing about people building bomb shelters, atom bomb shelters, because it was the Cold War.

419
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:30,399
And there were this argument among whether if somebody else is outside and they don't have a shelter or something's happened to their shelter, should you let them into yours?

420
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:41,439
And there was sort of on the one side the Olympian types who said the rationale, yes, you can't leave a human being out there in the radioactivity just because he's not a member of the family.

421
00:31:41,439 --> 00:31:44,639
And there were the Fury types who said, We built this, this is for us.

422
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,560
We got to hoard our own food.

423
00:31:48,879 --> 00:31:52,399
There's nobody we could care about but our own blood family.

424
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,800
And you could see that contrast.

425
00:31:54,800 --> 00:32:02,799
And the Furies are still doing that, taking up the side of the blood and the family.

426
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,280
Okay, did I see anything else?

427
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:11,439
Now, I got to, let me see if there's anything more I have to say about that.

428
00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:13,039
Well, only one thing.

429
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,600
Of course, the Furies are women.

430
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,119
We said that way at the top.

431
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:22,639
And the Olympians are men in general, with some minor complications.

432
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:30,719
Therefore, you should be upset, and I was, when the Furies are called he on page 83, for instance.

433
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:40,560
You don't see it because they're talking about the spirit in the middle of the page, the spirit thrice glutted that lives in this race.

434
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,040
From him, deep in the nerve, is given blood.

435
00:32:43,040 --> 00:33:00,679
The spirit in the race is the Furies who are causing all this trouble in the family relations between Atreus and Thaestes, and then the next generation, we're going to have the killing of Agamemnon by one of the children.

436
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:02,759
You can figure this all out by reading Latimer.

437
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,679
I never can keep it straight.

438
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:12,119
But one thing is sure: and yet the spirit from him, deep in the nerves, is given what him.

439
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,080
The first time I read it, I practically gave up.

440
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,919
I thought, I don't understand this play.

441
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:18,200
I'm never going to understand it.

442
00:33:18,199 --> 00:33:20,279
I don't even know if Aeschylus understands it.

443
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:26,119
And you get it again on page 86, middle of the Clytemnestra speech at the top.

444
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:31,320
Hereafter, let him go forth to make bleed with death and guilt the houses of others.

445
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:35,320
That's the spirit a little earlier, the spirit in the house.

446
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:37,160
This is all furies.

447
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,919
So what's going on?

448
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:48,520
Well, this is a very uninteresting grammatical mistake that Latimer is just too oblivious or literal or something to pay attention to.

449
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:57,959
You know, in some languages, there are neuter and masculine and feminine nouns in German, all three.

450
00:33:57,959 --> 00:33:59,399
In French, too.

451
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:00,280
How many know this?

452
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,640
I've had already in some course, some language where, okay.

453
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,640
Well, this is just a case of that.

454
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,480
It turns out that the furies is a masculine word.

455
00:34:09,479 --> 00:34:12,599
So when you refer to the furies, you have to say he.

456
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:18,520
Any sensible person translating it into English would just change it to the pronoun to she.

457
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:26,759
In German, the word for girl, Meijen, is neuter.

458
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,959
And I suppose you say it.

459
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:30,280
Do you say it when you refer to a young girl, Beatrice?

460
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,919
You say it, even though you're referring to a girl.

461
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:41,479
Because the pronoun goes by the way, the gender of the noun, then it has nothing to do with the gender of the person.

462
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:53,440
So, just whenever you see she, you just pay attention, and if you see he, then you better mark it if it's the Furies and make sure that you cross it out and put she.

463
00:34:55,039 --> 00:35:04,320
The Furies are always female, always tied up with this fertility, mother, blood side.

464
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:11,279
So, now, what's the problem behind this when you get this all on the board?

465
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,280
Well, these two are okay.

466
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,520
I mean, they're both important aspects.

467
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:20,720
A culture ought to do justice to both of them.

468
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:27,040
But what's crazy about this culture is that they're fanatics.

469
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:38,960
Either they're fanatics who believe in the new gods and think that the Fury should be written out of the picture, like Homer, who was the first of the anti-Fury people.

470
00:35:38,959 --> 00:35:42,560
And Homer practically did write them out of the Greek culture.

471
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,960
It's amazingly how close he came, but he didn't succeed.

472
00:35:46,959 --> 00:36:03,360
Another thousand years later, the Furies are back, in spite of Homer, in spite of the fact that they're still reading the Odyssey and take it to be their kind of Bible, an example of how men and women, and servants, and children, and everything should behave.

473
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:22,240
They nonetheless are a vengeance culture in which they are back being appealing, just appealing to the Furies for revenge when anything happens to their family, to their blood relatives.

474
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:37,080
So it's a culture in which these two sets of values, which could, you know, in principle, sort of supplement each other if each stayed in the right place, each one claims to be the authority.

475
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:38,599
Each one claims just one second.

476
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,840
That when people do things in their name, it's justice.

477
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,680
You've got to keep your eyes open.

478
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,840
There are two kinds of justice.

479
00:36:48,039 --> 00:37:06,200
There's the feud kind of justice, the Hatfields and McCoy's kind of justice, where if somebody does anything to your clan or your family, or it's kind of mafia justice, then it's just, it's right, it's required that you go and kill one of them.

480
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,200
And they keep claiming, the Furies, that they're in charge of justice.

481
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,640
And let's call that vengeance justice.

482
00:37:13,959 --> 00:37:19,480
And then there is the, they've got their sense of justice, but the new gods have their sense of justice.

483
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:27,879
Let's call that retribution, or by which I mean legal kind of justice.

484
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:36,520
They did this, and thanks to the institutions of the culture, we will take them to court and we will put them in prison or chop off their heads.

485
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:43,640
But we don't just do it individually with kind of, what's the word?

486
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,320
What did I say about just a second?

487
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,600
Well, vengeance and retribution are the best words I know.

488
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:54,679
And these are in terms of vengeance.

489
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,799
It's old.

490
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,399
It's blood.

491
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,919
And these are in terms of, I guess, retribution.

492
00:38:00,919 --> 00:38:04,440
It's legal justice.

493
00:38:04,439 --> 00:38:12,160
And in the middle, I'll just put justice, because both they all there's only, I don't think Aeschylus has a word for these two separate things.

494
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,679
He calls them all justice.

495
00:38:13,999 --> 00:38:20,239
But he knows there's a big difference, because the whole fight is about which kind of justice.

496
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,440
Now, go ahead.

497
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:33,360
How do you know that the reason that the Furies aren't really mentioned in the Odyssey is because they just weren't that important, and that they just became more important in the Orange Day.

498
00:38:33,999 --> 00:38:38,079
I mean, I understand that they in mythology, they came from...

499
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:38,879
Good.

500
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,879
I think that's a very good question.

501
00:38:40,879 --> 00:38:42,000
I don't know.

502
00:38:41,999 --> 00:38:44,160
And I have no right to say it, really.

503
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,680
So I have to think about that.

504
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,800
Did you hear his question?

505
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:54,959
He wants to know how come I say that the Furies were being repressed by Homer, and how do I know that they just weren't very important?

506
00:38:54,959 --> 00:39:01,119
And Homer was expressing this fact that once upon a time the Furies were important, but now they're not anymore.

507
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:07,200
And that's why, when he writes up the work of art for his culture and focuses it, he doesn't have a place for the Furies.

508
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,560
Am I understanding you?

509
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:09,840
They weren't important.

510
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:13,519
I see they were never important until Aeschylus made a big fuss about them.

511
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,280
How do I know that they were ever important until Aeschylus made a fuss about them?

512
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:18,399
Good question.

513
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:18,879
Yeah.

514
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,280
Why don't they just say that the Furies weren't worried about the budget?

515
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,240
I think I've got them in Balawk and T.

516
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,800
So now there was no competitive life.

517
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,119
Now about Hemer's life, how many possible people did it?

518
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,399
Protect the old way, the family way.

519
00:39:44,399 --> 00:39:46,000
Okay, interesting.

520
00:39:45,999 --> 00:39:54,320
But the way they do it is so much this kind of old-fashioned vengeance.

521
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,239
You kill a member of my family, and I'm going to kill a member of your family, no matter who.

522
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:04,200
It doesn't have to be anybody who did anything wrong, just them being a member of the other family.

523
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:09,879
That's how they act now, the way Aeschylus is portraying them.

524
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:15,160
It's all sort of plannish local interest.

525
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,680
Now, that isn't the way it's in Athens.

526
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:26,200
Aeschylus is telling the Athenians, and I didn't want to go into this yet, but I think you people are sort of forcing me to.

527
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:32,679
Aeschylus is telling the Athenians how they got to be the kind of people they are.

528
00:40:32,999 --> 00:40:41,079
And the kind of people they are are not fury-driven people, and they're not enlightenment fanatics either.

529
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:42,680
They're better than either.

530
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:47,719
But that you don't find out how they got that way and what it is to be better until the third play.

531
00:40:48,039 --> 00:41:11,240
So, but there, Aeschylus is either making up, I don't know, a time, or really dimly through, I don't know what people, old stories and myths and so forth, reconstructing a time in the culture in which the Furies and the Olympian gods were equally powerful.

532
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:21,000
And all we've got to go on, and that's what you guys are saying, there are no history books about this period, this was this archaic period.

533
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:37,639
And all we've got is sort of Aeschylus using the folktales and the myths to reconstruct this culture, which he claims was there all along.

534
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:43,120
That's this claim that it's the oldest, and that's why her question about which came first, Homer, or so forth.

535
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:48,240
And Aeschylus is really making up a story that I was following.

536
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:50,879
But I didn't tell you it was just a story.

537
00:41:50,879 --> 00:41:53,120
I told you as if I knew that it was true.

538
00:41:53,120 --> 00:42:14,160
But Aeschylus is making up a story in which Homer has repressed and ignored the forces for family and vengeance and all the stuff over here in the name of the pantheon, which he's promoting over here.

539
00:42:14,479 --> 00:42:26,480
And he's telling you the story that this repressing this, which is what Homer did, is going to cause a great deal of trouble.

540
00:42:26,479 --> 00:42:40,960
And you will find that the Furies, as you read it, are upset, are furious, indeed, that we still have the word around at the way they've been treated by the Olympian gods.

541
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:47,120
Now, and if anybody thinks that there's any historical evidence for this, let me know.

542
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:53,999
There are other myths and other poems by Hesiod from the same, from roughly the time of Homer.

543
00:42:53,999 --> 00:43:00,399
There's a whole bunch of other myths and things that were written down later that come from the time of Homer.

544
00:43:00,399 --> 00:43:03,520
I don't know what any of them have to say about the Furies.

545
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:05,679
But in the end, we don't care.

546
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,960
I mean, that's important.

547
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:22,720
I mean, we have to just, what's interesting to us is the story that Aeschylus has made up to show the Athenians what they stand for and why their culture is better than any culture there's ever been before or after in the world.

548
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,320
And he does it by this history.

549
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:33,159
While I'm talking about this, I wrote here the places where Homer talks about the furies, and you can look at them.

550
00:43:33,399 --> 00:43:34,280
I'll read them to you.

551
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,879
They're very few.

552
00:43:36,919 --> 00:43:47,080
And Homer doesn't seem to even understand them very well, because at one place, anyway, he says he's talking about Oedipus.

553
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:53,879
And Oedipus, Jocasta, Oedipus's wife, a lot of you read Sophocles.

554
00:43:53,879 --> 00:43:54,760
How many read Oedipus?

555
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,360
As I recall, many, many.

556
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,560
Okay, so you know who Jocasta was, Oedipus's wife.

557
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:04,360
She hung herself because she married her son, and neither one of them knew it.

558
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:11,479
And she, her furies, attacked Oedipus, according to Homer.

559
00:44:11,479 --> 00:44:13,399
So let's see where I can see.

560
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:24,520
So she thrust from a high rafter, throttled in her noose, she swung, carried away by pain, and left him endless agony from a mother's furies.

561
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:29,399
Because she is his mother and his wife, and she hung herself.

562
00:44:29,399 --> 00:44:32,919
And according to Homer, the furies then pursued him.

563
00:44:32,919 --> 00:44:35,159
But that seems pretty crazy.

564
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:39,320
And certainly Sophocles has dropped that from the story.

565
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:45,959
So that one, I don't even think Homer has lost any sense of what the Furies are up to.

566
00:44:45,959 --> 00:44:53,879
He just knows people talk about them going after people whose mother who killed their mother.

567
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:02,360
And in a weird sense, Oedipus killed his mother, but certainly that that's pretty far-fetched.

568
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,879
So here's another.

569
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,760
So that was on page 194.

570
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,680
On 23, or was that already 23?

571
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,280
No, here, on 23, I read this, I think.

572
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,079
Didn't I?

573
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:14,960
I don't know.

574
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,680
Maybe not.

575
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:32,319
So about 15 lines down, Telemachus is saying, I better not do bad things to my mother the way you suitors want me to do, because if I do, the powers of darkness would requite it.

576
00:45:32,879 --> 00:45:38,479
My mother's parting curse would call hell's furies to punish me.

577
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,679
And hell's, by the way, is something that I that, what's his name?

578
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,760
Fritz Gerald has put in there, I think, because Latimer says her furies.

579
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,479
That would be better.

580
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:52,640
My mother's parting curse would call her furies to punish me.

581
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,600
Speaking of that, we can add one more on this list that I never really thought about before.

582
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:05,120
Whenever people curse people for doing some bad thing to them or their families, you get over here.

583
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,640
What goes over here?

584
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,640
It's very interesting.

585
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,879
Well, you'll see oaths go over here.

586
00:46:10,879 --> 00:46:16,639
Remember, I said that Menelaus and Agamemnon made oaths.

587
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:22,320
It's funny, you don't distinguish very clearly anymore in English between oaths and curses.

588
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,599
He swore an oath.

589
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:28,959
But when you, but in the really right English, when you swear an oath, you can swear it on the Bible.

590
00:46:28,959 --> 00:46:31,759
You can swear it sort of in the name of God.

591
00:46:32,879 --> 00:46:35,760
It means just a very serious promise.

592
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,399
But a curse, then you is different.

593
00:46:38,399 --> 00:46:43,360
Then you invoke the powers of darkness and evil on the person you curse.

594
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,879
So when anybody curses anybody, they call on the furies.

595
00:46:46,879 --> 00:46:50,479
When they make oaths and promises, they call on the Olympian gods.

596
00:46:50,479 --> 00:46:53,119
It's just another aspect of the same thing.

597
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,800
Only I never thought about it before, so I'll write it down.

598
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,000
Here we have curses.

599
00:46:58,999 --> 00:47:00,599
It's going to turn out to be important.

600
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:21,480
I'll tell you right now, because it's hard to understand, that what Agamemnon does when he kills Ephigenia is put is gag her so she can't say anything, so that she can't call down she can't curse him by calling on the mother on her furies.

601
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:26,120
And so, that's just part of the same story.

602
00:47:26,439 --> 00:47:35,239
Now, yeah, I'm going to go on reading these because they interest they're interesting given that you, particularly, you guys are now sort of raising the question what were what was Homer thinking?

603
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:39,240
So, 2326.

604
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:42,040
If you find any more, you've got to let me know.

605
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,079
Yes, there are furies.

606
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:47,800
Okay, here's one at the bottom of 326.

607
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,960
I don't know who's talking.

608
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,320
Oh, this is disguised as the beggar.

609
00:47:55,320 --> 00:48:06,200
He says, If beggars interest the gods, if there are furies penned in the dark to avenge a poor man's wrong, then may Antinous meet his death before his wedding day.

610
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:18,439
Well, again, Homer doesn't seem to understand the furies, they're not in the job of defending beggars, they're exactly in the job of only defending blood relatives against anybody.

611
00:48:18,439 --> 00:48:25,959
I mean, their revenge against people who did anything to your blood relatives.

612
00:48:25,959 --> 00:48:33,159
So, it's just I don't know, he just doesn't think about them at all, or he doesn't think about them very clearly.

613
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,759
275, were they not important in the culture?

614
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,040
Or he didn't care?

615
00:48:40,439 --> 00:48:44,240
This one is so obscure that I won't even bother with it on 275.

616
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,720
But let's try 377.

617
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:47,680
Well, here's one.

618
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:48,959
You know what?

619
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:51,360
But it's on 377, about line 80.

620
00:48:51,360 --> 00:49:00,879
Aphrodite and glory walked on Olympus, begging for each a happy wedding day from Zeus, the lightnings, joyous king, and so forth and so forth.

621
00:49:00,879 --> 00:49:07,280
But even at that hour, the cyclone winds had ravished them away to serve the loathsome furies.

622
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,960
What's going on?

623
00:49:08,959 --> 00:49:10,640
God only knows.

624
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,479
I don't know.

625
00:49:12,479 --> 00:49:14,480
You'd have to look it up to find out.

626
00:49:14,479 --> 00:49:21,280
But it doesn't sound like it's got anything to do with what Aeschylus has made of it.

627
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:34,080
So all we have to do is just say, look, we're trying not to do Greek history, though it would be nice if we could, but we're trying to understand how Aeschylus understands the history of the people of Athens.

628
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:40,800
And he's going to claim that the Furies were always there.

629
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:50,240
And after all, there was always feeling and dark and night and the family and blood relatives and tradition and so forth.

630
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,760
It was always there.

631
00:49:51,999 --> 00:49:54,480
Homer just didn't have any place for it.

632
00:49:54,479 --> 00:50:01,360
And therefore, it got worse because when you repress something and don't give it any place, it'll come out someplace else.

633
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,439
He's got a kind of Freudian view about that.

634
00:50:03,439 --> 00:50:06,800
You can't just get rid of the Furies by denying them.

635
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,080
You've got to confront them and integrate them somehow.

636
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:15,280
And Homer, as you can just see from what I read, didn't confront them and didn't integrate them.

637
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:27,960
And Aeschylus' story is: so they got worse and worse until I suppose he thinks he's writing it about, well, who knows when he thinks he's writing, because he seems he's writing at the same time as Homer.

638
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,919
Obviously, the same people are involved and the same gods.

639
00:50:33,479 --> 00:50:36,360
He thinks Homer just didn't see what was really going on.

640
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:40,040
The Furies were there and they were very upset that Homer didn't see them.

641
00:50:40,439 --> 00:50:42,360
That's the way he sets it up.

642
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:48,280
Okay, so now we are, we got that settled.

643
00:50:48,919 --> 00:50:50,919
I'm just giving you to see where we are.

644
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:53,720
Vengeance has to do with personal feuds.

645
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:57,320
It's not justice in the sense of impersonal.

646
00:50:57,959 --> 00:51:01,560
It's not obeying the law and so forth.

647
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,080
We've got that.

648
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:09,160
And the question is, now, which side is Aeschylus on once you put all this up here?

649
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:12,760
Is he for the Furies or is he for the Olympian gods?

650
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:16,360
Well, I think Aeschylus just sees that they're both.

651
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:23,480
They both have their value, and they're both very dangerous if they become fanatics.

652
00:51:23,479 --> 00:51:35,080
Apollo is just as dangerous as the Furies when he thinks that everything is rational and you shouldn't have any feelings or any local partiality or anything like that.

653
00:51:36,039 --> 00:51:42,599
So he either thinks that the new gods are a decline, which is what the Fury is thinking, or that they're progress.

654
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,680
That's not what he thinks.

655
00:51:45,959 --> 00:51:50,520
He thinks that both sides, I just read it, are absolutely important.

656
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:59,560
And if you leave, and it becomes clear in the third play when the Furies give a wonderful speech about what will happen if you leave them out.

657
00:51:59,559 --> 00:52:01,480
There will be no more fertility.

658
00:52:01,479 --> 00:52:04,440
There will be no more erotic love.

659
00:52:04,439 --> 00:52:09,719
There will be no more loving and raising children and so forth and so forth.

660
00:52:09,959 --> 00:52:17,839
And it's clear that they've got a strong case, that you couldn't have a culture if you just had people like Apollo or gods like Apollo running around.

661
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,239
And where is Zeus in all this then?

662
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:25,760
Well, that's another interesting story, which I want to be sure and get to, which I will.

663
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,919
So let me look at you some more.

664
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:32,560
So Zeus is one of the Olympian gods, obviously.

665
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:50,079
But just like in Homer, Zeus isn't for any particular something or other, not a particular mood, and not a particular way of life, like the Furies are for the local family women, children way of life, and so forth.

666
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:53,919
And the other ones are for the legal universal.

667
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,040
Zeus isn't for a way of life.

668
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,519
He's again connected with guests.

669
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:02,000
And we've talked about that, but I've now got pages.

670
00:53:01,999 --> 00:53:09,840
Funny, because it made sense for him to be, as I say, God of strangers when they were going from world to world.

671
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,159
It doesn't really make any particular sense.

672
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:20,479
It's just left over from the old days and from Homer that he's now still called the God who takes care of strangers.

673
00:53:20,479 --> 00:53:22,000
Now, where is that?

674
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,399
36.

675
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,039
Oh, yeah, at the very bottom.

676
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:35,360
So drives Zeus, the great guest god, the Atridi, that's the Greeks, against Alexander, whenever that's Paris.

677
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:39,119
So he's, but there he's, why is he driving the Greeks against Paris?

678
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,520
Because Paris has been a bad guest.

679
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:45,039
He's now on the side of the host, not on the side of the strangers.

680
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:46,079
That isn't a big deal.

681
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:47,680
It's just a funny fact.

682
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:58,919
And it's a kind of offshoot of polytheism no longer being something that really is what the culture takes seriously.

683
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:02,519
So they've got to find a new God, a new job for Zeus.

684
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:08,119
And it's not enough that he just protects households from bad things that guests might do.

685
00:54:09,559 --> 00:54:16,440
We do hear on page 56 that he's kindly to strangers, but all that I think isn't interesting.

686
00:54:16,439 --> 00:54:17,879
I'll tell you what it is in a minute.

687
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:21,399
About six lines down, Zeus kindly to strangers.

688
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:28,119
But that, I just don't know.

689
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,479
It's something that just seems to be dropped in.

690
00:54:31,479 --> 00:54:33,000
Nothing important happens.

691
00:54:32,999 --> 00:54:35,320
So what is important about Zeus?

692
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:46,360
Well, I think Aeschylus, being a very, very, very smart person, as you'll see by the end of the third play, he wrote, this is the work of art, the mother of all works of art.

693
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,600
It's the most perfect work of art.

694
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:56,040
And Aeschylus wrote it in a certain sense, knowing that he was doing it and knowing and purposely writing it.

695
00:54:56,439 --> 00:55:06,360
And he also is a kind of brilliant theologian, though he hasn't got the language of philosophy to help him.

696
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:13,320
What he really thinks, I believe, is that Zeus is behind everything.

697
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,399
I'll read you the passage where he says something like that.

698
00:55:15,399 --> 00:55:17,640
And what is behind everything?

699
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:20,999
Well, it's the understanding of being in the practices.

700
00:55:20,999 --> 00:55:25,399
I mean, Zeus is all of it makes sense.

701
00:55:25,399 --> 00:55:28,199
When anything happens, Zeus is behind it.

702
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,760
That's the sense in which he's not on any side.

703
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,679
He's beyond being on any side.

704
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:36,600
But let me give you quotes because it's so strange and interesting.

705
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:45,519
So Zeus turns out not only to be kindly to strangers, which is an Olympian thing.

706
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:46,399
I just quoted it.

707
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:48,639
I'm showing you still he's on both sides.

708
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:57,600
And not only is he Olympian, but he's also partial to the furies, or at least they belong to him too.

709
00:55:57,919 --> 00:56:05,360
At the bottom of 83, surely it is a huge and heavy spirit bending the house to cry.

710
00:56:05,999 --> 00:56:08,640
Whenever you hear this spirit's talk, that's the furies.

711
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,679
Alas, the bitter glory of doom that shall never be done with.

712
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:16,640
And all through Zeus, Zeus, first cause, prime mover.

713
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,479
For what thing without Zeus is done among mortals?

714
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:22,640
See, Zeus is behind everything.

715
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,360
That's bad translation.

716
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,479
I'll fix it in a minute.

717
00:56:26,479 --> 00:56:35,120
I mean, first cause is Aristotle's name for the God that is controlling and making everything happen.

718
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:37,759
Prime mover is another Aristotelian name.

719
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:43,119
Well, surely Aeschylus is a, at least, I think, two generations before Aristotle.

720
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:47,760
He has no clue of that kind of jargon, that philosophical talk.

721
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,759
And the translation doesn't say that.

722
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:56,319
The translation says something like, Zeus is responsible for all.

723
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,640
Or I would just say, Zeus is behind everything.

724
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:11,440
That's what Aeschylus really is trying to get at, which gets translated to contemporary, but it's the right idea.

725
00:57:11,439 --> 00:57:20,800
Zeus is the single power that makes everything meaningful and makes everything happen.

726
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,559
He's not a creator god.

727
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:24,960
That's a very Judeo-Christian thing.

728
00:57:24,959 --> 00:57:32,280
But Zeus is the force or the power or something like that behind everything that happens.

729
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:36,280
It's, I think, the way the cultural practices are behind everything.

730
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,560
The way an understanding of being is behind everything.

731
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:41,240
And so that he's...

732
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:49,879
He's behind the Furies and their understanding of being as family and vengeance, and he's behind the Olympian gods and their understanding of being.

733
00:57:49,879 --> 00:57:56,040
And in a way, he's beyond all of that because he's what makes all of that possible.

734
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:07,480
And he's also, seems to be the tendency in the practices that if they are conflictual, then they lead to suffering.

735
00:58:07,479 --> 00:58:14,040
And then you keep hearing, and through suffering, things will get better.

736
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:15,320
What is it?

737
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:22,599
Man only learns through suffering and all these quotes where I would like a good suffering quote right now, but I don't have it.

738
00:58:22,919 --> 00:58:25,399
This chorus is always talking about that.

739
00:58:25,399 --> 00:58:29,159
Suffer, suffer, but good wing out in the end, they say every once in a while.

740
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,119
Well, Zeus is the force.

741
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,640
I mean, it needn't be like that.

742
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:38,680
Cultures could just be worlds in collision and destroy each other.

743
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:47,080
But if you're willing to suffer, or maybe you're not willing, it's not even irrelevant, a certain amount of suffering and the culture will improve.

744
00:58:47,079 --> 00:59:01,720
Keep in mind, when you hear that, that what happened to Afro-Americans, how after a whole lot of suffering, they finally got more and more of what they were promised by the Constitution.

745
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:15,360
Or think about how the lot of women gradually has improved and will improve more and more as the world gets gradually taken over by Western ways of thinking, or think the latest is sort of gay liberation.

746
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:23,360
In each case, there's lots and lots of suffering, and it's nobody's fault, and nobody can really do anything about it.

747
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:33,919
But as suffering enough, and Goodwin's out in the end, I think that's, I think Zeus is behind that, or that is, that that happens is Zeus.

748
00:59:33,919 --> 00:59:42,720
That there is practices, that they give meaning to your life, and that those practices can themselves evolve.

749
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:48,879
I think Aeschylus understands all that amazingly enough, though he has no language to say it.

750
00:59:48,879 --> 00:59:52,000
And I think he just puts that all on Zeus.

751
00:59:51,999 --> 01:00:01,439
And then, sort of more interesting of all in a way, is that he knows that he doesn't have any adequate way of understanding it.

752
01:00:01,439 --> 01:00:04,559
Look on page 39, that is quite remarkable.

753
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:13,760
He says, it's mind-boggling, right at the bottom of 39, Zeus, whatever he may be.

754
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:18,240
And so in the end, he knows that it's something he hasn't been able to name.

755
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:24,879
He hasn't been able to, he hasn't got the language to describe it, but he knows that it's behind everything.

756
01:00:24,879 --> 01:00:25,520
Yeah.

757
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:31,600
Yes, I think it's the divine power, and I think it is monotheism in a good way.

758
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:39,039
That is, somehow, Zeus is the unity of all this seemingly hopelessly conflicted culture.

759
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:45,759
And behind it, and making it all happen, and maybe making it all turn out all right, there is this power.

760
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:56,559
The one thing you don't want to say, and that's why I'm a little nervous with monotheism, is it's not a kind of creator god like our kind of monotheism.

761
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:58,679
It's not Judeo-Christian monotheism.

762
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:02,680
I don't think Aeschylus even glimmers that, wants that.

763
01:01:02,999 --> 01:01:06,840
It's this Heideggerian, which I talk about every once in a while, kind of monotheism.

764
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:26,040
There is an understanding of being, it's behind everything, it makes everything intelligible, it tells you what it makes sense to do, it lets you understand things as the sort of things that they are, and that's and there's one such something or other, and that's about all he can understand.

765
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:41,560
The one thing I think you don't, he doesn't, he is moving away from trying to have one God like Zeus and making it something more like one force or one principle or something very abstract, I think.

766
01:01:41,559 --> 01:01:42,999
So we haven't got much to go on.

767
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:46,360
We're not disagreeing about much either, I think.

768
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:49,239
It's it's okay, yes, Beatrice.

769
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:55,480
Yeah, Clytemnestra invoking Zeus.

770
01:01:55,479 --> 01:01:58,360
Zeus is she's invoking Zeus on 65.

771
01:01:58,680 --> 01:01:59,720
Oh, yeah.

772
01:02:00,039 --> 01:02:00,599
Good.

773
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:02,919
I mean, I think we're agreeing, aren't we?

774
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:07,720
That Zeus is, you can invoke Zeus when you would invoke the Furies.

775
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,840
You can invoke Zeus when you would invoke the Olympians.

776
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:15,720
Aeschylus has got some idea that Zeus is beyond that conflict.

777
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:20,200
And keep your eye open for that.

778
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:24,119
If you can make up the story about Zeus, that would be an interesting topic.

779
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:34,439
I'm not sure that it's, I'm afraid it's probably sort of too hard to grasp for Aeschylus, and therefore too hard for us to grasp in Aeschylus.

780
01:02:34,439 --> 01:02:34,839
Yeah.

781
01:02:35,479 --> 01:02:49,039
Yes, oddly enough, and Beatrice's quote is very important there, that he, that Clytemnestra could invoke Zeus on the side of her constantly invoking the furies and the curse and the family blood on the house of Atreus.

782
01:02:49,439 --> 01:02:50,959
What was that page again, Beatrice?

783
01:02:50,959 --> 01:02:52,320
I think that's interesting.

784
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,919
What, 65?

785
01:02:53,919 --> 01:02:58,320
Okay, because you want to see that Zeus is really above the conflict.

786
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,080
Zeus here.

787
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:01,439
That's Clytemnestra.

788
01:03:01,439 --> 01:03:03,600
Okay, I'm going to write that down.

789
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:06,159
Okay, let's go on because I can't say more about Zeus.

790
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:06,800
I wish I could.

791
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:11,440
I think it's fascinating that Aeschylus is trying to do what he's trying to do there.

792
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:21,360
Now, we've got to get to the rest of the time, to something I promised I would get to last time, but there was so much to do in between.

793
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:24,960
Now, we get to Agamemnon's tragedy.

794
01:03:24,959 --> 01:03:31,679
That is, finally, we've got to look carefully at what happens when he has this problem.

795
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:41,039
Problem is an understatement, this disaster, as he calls it, of having to either sacrifice his daughter or not, and both of them are going to be terrible.

796
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:41,999
So, let's go.

797
01:03:41,999 --> 01:03:46,399
He's caught in a conflict because he's a father and a king.

798
01:03:46,399 --> 01:03:52,080
He's got personal feelings, and he's got a public role.

799
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:55,520
And he has to choose one or the other.

800
01:03:55,519 --> 01:04:07,440
Somehow, the way Odysseus' polytheism worked, he could be a father and a king, and a pirate, and an adventurer, but that's not how it works anymore in the way Aeschylus pictures it.

801
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:14,080
There are only these two forces, and they're both absolutely important, and he's got to choose.

802
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,599
So we're in trouble.

803
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,280
I just want to give you the whole picture now, since the poetry is so hard.

804
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,960
I want to make sure you see it.

805
01:04:20,959 --> 01:04:26,320
Because what happened with her is going to turn out to be extremely important next time.

806
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,120
So we've got to get it right this time.

807
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:32,119
Okay, to begin with, as I said, the soldiers are starving.

808
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:34,599
Just, oh, by the way, look at this.

809
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:36,680
I just opened on 40.

810
01:04:36,999 --> 01:04:37,719
Wow.

811
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,320
I wish I mean, that's what I want.

812
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:45,480
It says, Zeus, who guided men to think, has laid it down that wisdom comes alone through suffering.

813
01:04:45,479 --> 01:04:46,440
That's good.

814
01:04:46,439 --> 01:04:47,800
I wonder about the think.

815
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,200
I would go look at the translation for that.

816
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:55,399
But that wisdom comes alone through suffering is what will kind of, it comes again and again.

817
01:04:55,399 --> 01:04:57,480
But that's not what I want to talk about right now.

818
01:04:57,479 --> 01:04:59,159
The soldiers are starving.

819
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,360
Where is that?

820
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:05,879
Oh, yeah, the middle, a little below the middle, about line 186.

821
01:05:05,879 --> 01:05:08,599
When no ship sailed, no pail was full.

822
01:05:08,599 --> 01:05:09,399
That's the starving.

823
01:05:09,399 --> 01:05:13,160
And the Achaean people salt fast against the shore.

824
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,999
Then the prophet's going to say something.

825
01:05:14,999 --> 01:05:32,680
So they're starving, and Agamemnon has got to choose because the prophet who's speaking for Artemis says you can't get off and stay away until you do something.

826
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:37,320
And the delay is crumpling the flower and pride of Argos.

827
01:05:37,399 --> 01:05:40,040
I never noticed that before at the bottom of 40.

828
01:05:40,039 --> 01:05:41,560
That's good.

829
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:44,040
I mean, that's the problem.

830
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:48,520
They're not only starving, they're sort of falling apart, just sitting there.

831
01:05:48,519 --> 01:05:52,440
And so then what happened?

832
01:05:52,439 --> 01:05:54,919
Well, what does Agamemnon say?

833
01:05:54,919 --> 01:05:56,519
This is a crucial speech.

834
01:05:56,519 --> 01:06:05,559
Because next time you're going to be asked to judge whether Agamemnon behaved well or badly or what when he killed Ephigenia.

835
01:06:05,559 --> 01:06:12,559
It's going to turn out to be absolutely crucial to Clytemnestra's approach to him.

836
01:06:11,879 --> 01:06:14,799
But let's start at the top of 41.

837
01:06:14,959 --> 01:06:33,520
He says, The elder lord, that's Agamemnon, the older brother, spoke aloud, My fate is angry if I disobey these, those are the soldiers, but anger if I slaughter this child, the beauty of my house, with maiden blood shed staining these fathers' hands beside the altar.

838
01:06:33,519 --> 01:06:37,040
What of these things goes now without disaster?

839
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:41,039
How shall I fail my ships and lose my faith in battle?

840
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:44,480
That is his role as the leader.

841
01:06:44,479 --> 01:06:50,320
For them, that is the soldiers, to urge such sacrifice of innocent blood angrily, for their wrath is great.

842
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,520
It is right.

843
01:06:51,519 --> 01:07:01,360
So he sees that it's wrong for him to kill Ephigenia, that it's right for him to kill Ephigenia, and his reaction is a perfectly human reaction.

844
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:03,520
He says, May all be well yet.

845
01:07:04,399 --> 01:07:06,879
He just says, let's hope things work out.

846
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,999
I don't know what to do.

847
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:09,439
I won't do anything.

848
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:10,800
Maybe it'll be all right.

849
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,240
But of course, it isn't.

850
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,639
So finally, he had to do something.

851
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:15,679
And then that goes on.

852
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:26,320
When necessity's yoke was put upon him, that is, the men are starving, he changed, and from his heart, the breath came bitter and sacrilegious, utterly infidel.

853
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:30,080
I mean, he sort of lost his faith in whatever.

854
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:40,399
And then, where he endured then to sacrifice his daughter, to stay the strength of war waged for a woman, first offering for the ship's sake.

855
01:07:40,399 --> 01:07:56,999
And then we, and then skipping down to this bad thing he did about not letting her curse him, the bottom, with guards against the lips, sweet edge, to check the curse cried on the house of Atreus by force of bit and speech drowned in strength, and therefore, that's it.

856
01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:58,200
He killed her.

857
01:07:59,479 --> 01:08:14,280
And he gags her, kills her, and doesn't help him, by the way, that he keeps her from cursing him because Agamemnon curses him and calls on the fury, on Iphigenia's fury, later.

858
01:08:14,599 --> 01:08:19,959
You can apparently do it for the person who can't do it for themselves.

859
01:08:21,799 --> 01:08:26,119
Now, the question is: did Agamemnon do the right thing?

860
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:27,879
What do you think?

861
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:28,759
Well, you're right.

862
01:08:28,759 --> 01:08:31,160
I mean, I can't imagine how anybody can answer that.

863
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,079
It's an impossible question.

864
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:38,200
From each, I mean, he did absolutely the right thing, and he did absolutely the wrong thing.

865
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:42,919
The situation was such that there was no way to do the right thing.

866
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:47,959
If he killed her, it was not going to be the right thing, and if he didn't kill her, it was not the right thing.

867
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,320
So, what happens then?

868
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:56,599
Well, the sky gods say he's a brave hero, willing to sacrifice his own daughter for a just war.

869
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:04,200
And if you're a president or a king who declares a just war, you better be ready to sacrifice your own children.

870
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,280
You're sacrificing everybody else's.

871
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:07,320
And he was.

872
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:08,919
What more could you ask?

873
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:11,159
A real hero.

874
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:28,119
And the army and the new gods are all on his side because they care about promises, oaths, guests behaving, and other non-family matters that govern social relations, kings and subjects, and so forth.

875
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:34,119
And justice for them is retribution.

876
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:44,719
That is, it's justice for them to go off and beat up Troy, destroy it completely, because Paris has done something wrong.

877
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:48,719
And that's at the top of 47.

878
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:54,320
Well, it starts at the top of 46, they say.

879
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:56,320
Oh, Zeus.

880
01:09:56,639 --> 01:09:58,879
Our Lord and Knight Beloved.

881
01:09:58,880 --> 01:09:59,360
Hmm.

882
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,559
That's not Zeus, of course.

883
01:10:00,559 --> 01:10:04,639
They are calling on both Zeus and the Furies, I guess.

884
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,879
And the binding net.

885
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,519
Yeah, that's Clytemnestra's Furies.

886
01:10:09,519 --> 01:10:14,080
And I gaze in awe on Zeus of the guests who wrung from Alexander such payment.

887
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,160
So it's all mixed up there.

888
01:10:16,559 --> 01:10:20,559
But was it, it was the right thing to do?

889
01:10:20,559 --> 01:10:22,079
Where do I find that?

890
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:25,679
Well, it's sort of about five or ten lines down on 47.

891
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,280
This was Paris.

892
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:34,879
He came to the house of the sons of Acreus, stole the woman away, shamed the guest rights of the board chaired, and so forth.

893
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:46,240
I think this is all supposed to say Paris did something wrong, and to fight and destroy him and Troy is the right thing to do.

894
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,599
It's just.

895
01:10:47,599 --> 01:10:53,839
But on the other hand, and now we get on page 48, all kinds of innocents died.

896
01:10:53,839 --> 01:11:00,079
Young, good people who shouldn't be out there having to fight this war.

897
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:06,240
And so, and their bodies come back in urns as ashes at the top of 48.

898
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:09,519
Many of them were touched by the heart of such things.

899
01:11:09,519 --> 01:11:14,479
Those they sent forth, they knew now in the place of the young men, urns and ashes are carried home.

900
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:18,559
At the time of the Vietnam War, which is before your time, it was body bags.

901
01:11:18,559 --> 01:11:22,240
And there were the bodies of the soldiers being carried home.

902
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:24,160
They're carried home from Iraq now.

903
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:35,000
And there was this period, we were around at that point, where they were trying to prevent people from taking pictures of the body bags stacked on the dock of the Americans killed.

904
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,519
Well, that's what they're worried about.

905
01:11:36,519 --> 01:11:40,599
And at the bottom of 48, the citizens speak, their voices dull with hatred.

906
01:11:40,599 --> 01:11:42,839
The curse of the people must be paid for.

907
01:11:42,839 --> 01:11:46,120
There lurks for me in the hooded night terror of what may be told.

908
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:54,439
The gods fail not to mark those who have killed many, the black furies stalking the fortunate and sending them down to darkness and so forth.

909
01:11:54,439 --> 01:11:56,999
That's the other side speaking.

910
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:08,280
Whoever killed all these men, who turned all of these young men into corpses, they're going to be gotten by the furies of the family.

911
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:22,759
I mean, the furies of the gold star mothers who've lost their children in the war are going to come after these people, people like Agamemnon, particularly, who's the one who took them all off to war.

912
01:12:22,759 --> 01:12:24,999
So now let's see.

913
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:30,039
So the Khoras who lost their children, I just read that.

914
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:36,280
So would it have been better if he hadn't gone off to war and hadn't killed Ephigenia?

915
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:37,159
Not really.

916
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:49,799
I mean, then the soldiers would have starved or they would have gone home humiliated and he would have lost the authority of king and it would have been, I guess, an equal mess as far as the way it's set up.

917
01:12:50,679 --> 01:12:53,559
There's something wrong somewhere, obviously.

918
01:12:53,559 --> 01:12:56,439
But it's not something wrong with Agamemnon, is it?

919
01:12:56,439 --> 01:12:58,839
Did he make the wrong choice?

920
01:12:58,839 --> 01:13:00,999
I mean, that would mean that he should have done the other thing.

921
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:06,679
He should not have killed Ephigenia and not done his job as king and kept his promise to his brother.

922
01:13:06,679 --> 01:13:12,360
I think there's, it's, it's, I don't think, or at least the question is, is there something psychological?

923
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:21,119
Is there something wrong with Agamemnon's character or personality or something that's behind making this big bad mistake?

924
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,639
You've got to be very careful.

925
01:13:22,639 --> 01:13:26,079
I'm now trying to set you up for next time, what you have to look for.

926
01:13:26,399 --> 01:13:29,519
It's clear that Agamemnon has freedom.

927
01:13:29,519 --> 01:13:33,200
He's free to kill Iphigenia or not to kill Ephiginia.

928
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:36,240
He's free to act as king or as father.

929
01:13:36,559 --> 01:13:39,999
But his freedom is very limited.

930
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,679
I mean, those are the only choices and bad ones.

931
01:13:43,679 --> 01:14:01,360
I mean, it's quite, I mean, in another culture, he could have challenged Paris to a duel, or he could have asked God to forgive him, or he could have sought binding arbitration between the two sides and somehow got some compromise where everybody gave up something.

932
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:08,799
But in his culture, it looks like he's got a free choice, but the alternatives are very limited and very bad.

933
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:13,200
So then who's to blame for this mess?

934
01:14:13,839 --> 01:14:14,879
Anybody?

935
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,439
Or what's to blame for the mess?

936
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,159
Anybody got an idea?

937
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,399
I mean, surely something's wrong.

938
01:14:22,399 --> 01:14:23,200
Yeah.

939
01:14:23,519 --> 01:14:35,360
Okay, but Artemis sort of could only do that in a context in which, yeah, okay, in a context in which these are the only alternatives.

940
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:41,919
I mean, she just sort of pushes out into the open what's going on, that to just go off and leave.

941
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:52,639
If he goes off, he's going to go against his being a father, and everybody in all the family, blood connections, and young people are going to die.

942
01:14:52,639 --> 01:14:57,879
Or if he stays home, it's going to be sort of unacceptable humiliation.

943
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:02,360
Now, that isn't the way it has to be, but that's the way it has to be in that culture.

944
01:15:02,679 --> 01:15:04,919
It's the culture who seems to be at fault.

945
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:18,839
I mean, what sets it up so that there's nothing that he can do that's right is that the culture is run by two fanatical sets of gods: the fanatical Fury people and the fanatical Apollo people.

946
01:15:18,839 --> 01:15:21,479
Now, I'm just ready to where I want to be just a second.

947
01:15:21,479 --> 01:15:23,079
So, who's to blame?

948
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:24,839
Well, the culture.

949
01:15:24,839 --> 01:15:31,879
And now, the question is: for next time, finally, you get to read, you know, you read the introduction.

950
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:40,360
Now, you're going to get to see what tragedy means to Lattimore and what tragedy means to Aeschylus.

951
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:56,919
And you've got to ask yourself, and Lattimore's account of what happens, what happened when Ephigenia was killed, as told by Clytemnestra, and all of that, you're going to have to ask yourself finally.

952
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:59,879
Let me see how I wrote it, and then I'll let you go.

953
01:16:01,639 --> 01:16:09,719
Well, we really got to ask yourself: is this a psychological tragedy or a tragedy of cultural worlds in collision?

954
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:16,280
Is there any personal blame, or is it something much more ontological?

955
01:16:16,679 --> 01:16:20,839
Who, in effect, you could say, who's right about Aeschylus, me, or Lattimore?

956
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:48,959
And now, all you need to do to find out is reread the Latimore, only the part about Agamemnon when he comes home, and reread pages 56 to 65, which is what I'm going to analyze next time, and I want you to think hard about, which is Clytemnestra's description to the chorus of what you her version of Agamemnon's killing of Ephigenia.

957
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:55,919
And you're going to be asking yourself, is this a tragedy about a character who has a flaw and does something wrong?

958
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:00,240
Is it a psychological tragedy like Sophocles, Oedipus?

959
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,799
Or is it an ontological tragedy?

960
01:17:02,799 --> 01:17:04,719
And what does Latimer think?

961
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:05,999
What do you think?

962
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:06,879
That's it.

963
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:07,519
Okay.
