1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,199
I don't have anything clearer to say, unfortunately, than I said at the end last time about the peculiar kind of indifference that Melville wants you to see.

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:24,479
But I'm more convinced than ever that I was on the right track, which is that it's not, he's not taking back the meaning of anything.

3
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,879
He's saying that all these meanings are true.

4
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,320
There's no word, I'll try to say it again.

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:41,679
It isn't as if these meanings are all perspectives on one coherent world, because these meanings contradict each other.

6
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,159
But they are the last word.

7
00:00:44,159 --> 00:01:00,999
I mean, there is no more reality than all these interpretations, all of which are true to some extent in their way, and all of which only add up to chaos if you try to add them up, or to whiteness if you add them up.

8
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:10,919
But each of them is nonetheless a valuable, illuminating, and in a certain sense, true perspective on the world.

9
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:17,880
As long as you don't have an old-fashioned notion of true, that they correspond to the way things really are.

10
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:20,440
They are the way things really are.

11
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:27,480
There is nothing more fundamental than this whole lot of interpretations.

12
00:01:28,279 --> 00:01:39,079
It so changes your notion of truth and reality that it's hard to understand and it's hard to say, but you should think about it and see if it helps.

13
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:45,719
And I was surprised and sad nobody came to office hours who had been thinking about it, who would help straighten me out.

14
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,359
There's one more office hours coming up this coming Wednesday from 2 to 4.

15
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:59,000
If anybody thinks that I've got it wrong or that I've got it right, but it could be spelled out better, please come by and see me.

16
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:07,880
Okay, with that, I'll go back to, we'll go back to the course and finish.

17
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:21,799
I want to finish talking about Moby Dick, obviously, which I did in a way finish already because we did the chase and we did the end of the Pequod and we did the saving of Ishmael in Kweequeg's coffin.

18
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:29,559
But there are sort of big questions raised by Melville or Ishmael in the book, Moby Dick.

19
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:54,320
And I want to talk about those big questions, partly relating them to the questions from the whole course, and partly relating them to these Nietzsche quotes, because it's interesting to have a view that is as near to Melville as you can get, as far as I know, and yet, from a Melville point of view, completely wrong at the same time.

20
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:02,719
It helps a lot to understand a particular view, to see clearer what that view is by seeing what that view isn't.

21
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:11,280
So at the end, I want to talk about what polytheism is, according to Nietzsche and according to Melville.

22
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:20,880
But let's start where we are with Ishmael and the kind of identity, what kind of person Ishmael is.

23
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,719
And we have to find that out by contrasting it.

24
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:32,880
This is going to be a lot of contrasting because I don't see how to explain any of these things except by telling you also what they're not.

25
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:38,560
So the question is: there's several kinds of identity that you could have.

26
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,679
And Ishmael, I'm going to tell you first about the ones that Ishmael doesn't have.

27
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,960
You'll recognize this.

28
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,959
This is all, in a certain way, a kind of summary, as it ought to be, since it's supposed to be the Latin.

29
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,919
You're not supposed to take off on some totally new direction in your last lecture.

30
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:05,200
And I also hope it'll help sort of solidify your Moby Dick in your brains as you write when you write your papers.

31
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,279
Okay, there's something called, what I'm going to call a strong identity.

32
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:13,200
Sometimes people call that the modern subject.

33
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,399
That's the subject invented by Descartes.

34
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,560
That's the subject that is self-sufficient.

35
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,120
And it has a certain content, an identity.

36
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,959
I mean, it has, which is the person that that subject is.

37
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:41,560
And we're all, I mean, according to Descartes and Kant and most people even now, but we've got these strong identities, the modern identities.

38
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,320
The ones we've seen in the book are Ahab and Starbuck.

39
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:54,039
They're two extremes of having a sort of fixed identity.

40
00:04:54,040 --> 00:05:01,240
Ahab's is defiance and Starbucks is reverence.

41
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:10,599
And from Melville's point of view, they're both wrong because they're doubly totalizing.

42
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:20,360
They've got each of them a total view of the world, which covers everything, defying it or revering it.

43
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:22,599
And they're stuck in that one.

44
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:23,880
It doesn't change.

45
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,120
They've got only one mood.

46
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,160
Now, I came across different quotes.

47
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:30,440
They're all over the place.

48
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:56,919
I don't know if I ever just found one before that said in just so many exact words that Ahab's attitude is defiance, that you get it on page 486, which is in book, or in chapter 119, where he's talking to the lightning handles, wherever the lightning is shining off the masts of the ship.

49
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,839
And he says, it looks like it's about halfway in.

50
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,880
No, it's near the end, about a page and a half from the end.

51
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:10,039
For those who have my book, same with book I have, it's on 486, two-thirds of the way down.

52
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,320
He says, Oh, thou clear spirit of clear fire, and so forth.

53
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:19,120
He says these weird things, which I don't think we're supposed to believe.

54
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,160
What did somebody say?

55
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:29,440
Which he says, whom on these seas I, as Persian, once did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee that I bear the scar.

56
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,200
Boy, if anybody thinks we can believe that and make sense of that, it's beyond me.

57
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,760
I think he's just raving.

58
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:44,320
But then he says, I now know thee, clear spirit, and I know that thy right worship is defiance.

59
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:53,920
But we know that he already has been spitting in the holy water and generally and fighting with the priests of any temple he comes across.

60
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,280
And Melville, or Ishmael, let's just call it always Ishmael, since that's stay inside the book.

61
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:03,519
Ishmael respects that.

62
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,360
He talks about it.

63
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:17,519
Presumably, it's a kind of tragic greatness at the bottom of 71, which is chapter 16, about in the middle.

64
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,600
It's only a sentence, so it's not worth looking for, I don't think, but I'll read it.

65
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,279
Bottom of 71.

66
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,880
For all men tragically great are made so to a certain morbidness.

67
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,959
Be sure of this, O young ambition.

68
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,760
All mortal greatness is but disease.

69
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:44,640
I mean, he's talking just general stuff, but I think he's thinking that Ahab is one of those tragic, great, sick, really sick people.

70
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:51,760
And as for reverence for 473, we hear about Starbuck.

71
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,599
And again, I'm sure that there are other places, but one is enough.

72
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:09,720
At the end of chapter 114, no, it's the beginning of chapter, the second page of chapter 114, the bottom of 473.

73
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:12,760
This is Starbuck talking to the ocean, to the sea.

74
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:22,520
Loveliness unfathomable as ever lover saw in his young bride's eye, tell me not of thy teeth-teared sharks and thy kidnapping cannibal ways.

75
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,680
Let faith oust fact, let fancy oust memory.

76
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,640
I look down, I look deep down and do believe.

77
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,000
That is, he's in this mood of reverence and faith.

78
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:39,079
Nothing can penetrate it and shake him out of it.

79
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:52,360
And just as an added interesting little thing at the bottom there, Stubb and Stubb comes along and says, I'm Stubb, and Stubb has this history, but here Stubb takes oath that he has always been jolly.

80
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:59,560
Now he's another one stuck in a mood, more like the banger and boomer, who are always jolly.

81
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:08,520
I mean, that's a worse mood to be stuck in, I think, from Ishmael's point of view than defiance or reverence.

82
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:14,520
It just is so out of touch with reality, as Ed knows it is in the case of Starbuck.

83
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:19,400
So those are versions of the strong identity.

84
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,520
And certainly Ishmael rejects them all.

85
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,400
And the next one is: you could call it a post-modern identity.

86
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:53,760
If that's the modern subject, then after the modern subject, in our time, comes the person who defies, well, no, that's what I'm defies, who stands without taking any, whose way of taking a stand on everything is simply to accept completely the meaninglessness of it all.

87
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,800
I don't know if that's a mood or not, it occurs to me.

88
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,040
That's Balkington, of course.

89
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,479
And I guess it's a mood.

90
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:04,320
I guess he's stuck in a total mood, all right, a grim mood, remember?

91
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,120
That's the trouble with him, according to Ishmael.

92
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:14,480
He thinks he's a marvelous person, too, a demigod, he calls him.

93
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:20,640
But he's not anybody that Ishmael wants to emulate.

94
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:34,160
And he's standing in the infinite, in the meaninglessness of everything, and just affirming the meaninglessness or accepting or enduring, maybe would be better, the meaninglessness of everything.

95
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,400
This is on 371.

96
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,679
Where are we now?

97
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,239
Whoa.

98
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:43,999
I have no idea why I think it's on 371.

99
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:48,400
Let's try page 180, not that it has any relation to that.

100
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,200
Okay.

101
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:55,840
So it says Balkington is always in one grim mood, but those aren't about Balkington at all.

102
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,440
So I don't know what to make.

103
00:10:58,239 --> 00:11:01,040
There is this one Balkington passage, and we know it.

104
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:06,959
What interests me is what I think is here on 180 and 371.

105
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:14,640
180, which is the end of chapter 41, has something interesting, which I think I've quoted already, but it won't hurt to quote it again.

106
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:21,760
Back to Starbuck, who has this unquestioning faith in everything being all right.

107
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:47,240
He describes the boat as morally enfeebled by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in Starbuck, the invulnerable jollity of that's the being stuck in being jolly of stubborn and the recklessness in stubb, oh, jollity of indifference and recklessness in stubb, both, and the pervading mediocrity in flask.

108
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:51,560
Those sum up those identities, not Balkington's.

109
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,240
I've just written down, obviously, the wrong page number for that.

110
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:57,880
But you know, there's only one chapter on Balkington.

111
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:58,839
You can find it.

112
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,680
102.

113
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:03,480
Okay, but I wonder what I think, what I'm thinking of.

114
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:03,800
I don't know.

115
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,680
But anyway, 102, you might as well look at 102.

116
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,280
Because though I'm used to looking at it, that's the end of chapter 23.

117
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:18,520
But in landlessness alone resides the highest truth, shoreless and definite as God.

118
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:22,360
So better to perish in the howling infinite than dash upon the shore.

119
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:24,120
That's not Ishmael talking.

120
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:29,079
That's Ishmael getting inside of the way things look to Balkington.

121
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:33,400
And so he says, bear thee grimly, demigod, so forth.

122
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,720
Now, so we've got modern subjects, postmodern subjects.

123
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:50,120
What's interesting is something that is neither of these, that Melville is trying to make up and work out, and that's the polytheistic identity.

124
00:12:50,119 --> 00:13:02,680
It goes with Ishmael's first sentence of the book, in which Ishmael is, Paul says, call me Ishmael, doesn't even tell you his real name, and takes the name of a wanderer.

125
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:08,720
And I realize this time through, and I'm sure it's no accident, that's the first words of the book.

126
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,440
Call me Ishmael, and the last word of the book is that he's an orphan.

127
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:19,919
Being an orphan is another way of saying he's got no home, no mother, no father.

128
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,960
That was true of Ishmael once Abraham kicked him out.

129
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,200
And that's what it is.

130
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:39,680
That's something about this special kind of identity, which is open to all meaning, wherever you find it, gets in sync with and attuned to many moods.

131
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,759
And that's the nearest thing we get to the right way to live.

132
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:52,000
I think it is, according to Melville, the right way to live in our situation.

133
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,800
It doesn't mean that it's the best way to live.

134
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,600
Maybe things were better in Homeric Greece.

135
00:13:58,479 --> 00:13:59,599
I don't know about that.

136
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:00,880
I'll come back to that.

137
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:16,160
But for us who are not in Homeric Greece, the best thing you can do is have these, what he calls at the end of chapter 85, and I've read this before, divine intuitions.

138
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:23,200
And he says, for this, I thank God, for all have doubts, many deny.

139
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,400
The doubts are denials, few among them have intuitions.

140
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,079
Doubts of all things earthly and intuitions of some things heavenly.

141
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:43,280
This combination makes me either a believer, those are the onto-theological people, or an infidel, that's an atheist, a disbeliever, whether that's Balkington or Ahab.

142
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,720
They both come under infidels, I think, meaning non-believers.

143
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:49,920
So they're really two things.

144
00:14:49,920 --> 00:15:02,120
Believe there are two kinds of other ways of looking at things, to be a believer like Starbuck or a non-believer, but neither of those could possibly heal you.

145
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:04,920
They can't be holy.

146
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,280
They're not divine.

147
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,440
They have no sense of the sacred.

148
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:28,120
Well, Starbuck has, in a sense, too much sacred, sort of onto theological sacred, which keeps him stuck in one mood, something like where Dante's going to be stuck for eternity once he starts contemplating the absolute supreme being.

149
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:43,320
But the way to live is to have this openness to the divine intuitions, to be drawn into many situations and capable of the widest range of moods, remember, from bliss to sorrow.

150
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:51,320
I'm just going over some of my favorite passages, favorite in the sense that I think they help me make sense of the book.

151
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:59,240
And another one that is so important is the end of chapter 96.

152
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,999
I'm going to keep talking.

153
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:22,119
I come back every once in a while to the catscale eagle, because the catscale eagle is the name for this, in a way, this polytheistic way of life, namely, to be open to all sorts of moods, the extremist two, of joy and sorrow and so forth.

154
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:30,680
And at the bottom, at the end of that paragraph, of that chapter, 96, there is a wisdom that is woe, but there's a woe that is madness.

155
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,279
And that's Ahab, presumably.

156
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:47,279
And there is a catscale eagle in some souls, and that's him, that is Ishmael, that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces.

157
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:59,440
And even if he forever flies within the gorge, that gorge is in the mountains, so that even in his lowest swoop, the mountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain, even though they soar.

158
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:02,080
That's Ishmael.

159
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:35,039
Now, what I found something very interesting, I keep looking in Nietzsche's The Gay Science, which is what I teach in Philosophy 7, that it has such interesting relationship, and it's a generation after Moby Dick, and it is in some ways so close in realizing that God is dead, meaning that religion of the onto-theological sort doesn't seem plausible to people anymore, at least not to Melville and Nietzsche, that there are other things in here than that.

160
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:40,079
There are things I'm going to read every once in a while, amazingly close.

161
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:51,999
Here is Nietzsche talking about Homer, in which Homer sounds exactly like a cat-scale eagle.

162
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,240
That is, yeah, Homer.

163
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,000
That's what he says.

164
00:17:55,999 --> 00:18:26,559
Anyway, he says, a strong, bold, audacious soul to go through life with a calm eye and firm step, always prepared to risk all, festively impelled by the longing for undiscovered worlds and seas and people and gods, to hearken to music as if it were a sign that bold men, soldiers, seafarers were taking a brief rest.

165
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:35,400
And in the most profound enjoyment of the moment, and this is the amazing switch now, that's all been up in the sky, so to speak, happy.

166
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:49,479
And in the most profound enjoyment of the moment, to be overcome by tears and the whole crimson melancholy of the happy, who would not wish that all this might be his possession, his state?

167
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:51,799
That was the happiness of Homer.

168
00:18:51,799 --> 00:19:05,719
So he's describing Homer, Nietzsche, as this kind of extreme person that's sensitive to all the most melancholy and blissful moods.

169
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:15,639
Homer, as a cat-scale eagle, neither a bird of heaven nor a bird of the plain, but something better than either.

170
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,840
And what is Melville like?

171
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,759
We have to switch to Melville now.

172
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:34,519
He seems to think of himself as open to all moods, to local meanings where they occur, and doesn't insist on them, doesn't hold on to them, lets them draw him in fully, but gives them up when they're over.

173
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:47,239
Every once in a while I come back to these quotes from his letters to Hawthorne because they all say such things to Hawthorne that are quite special.

174
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:52,680
So, by the way, the Nietzsche, in case you want to look in the gay science, is on 242.

175
00:19:52,999 --> 00:20:02,119
And now we're looking at 560 in this book of letters, but you don't really need that, and it's very brief.

176
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,400
What I'm going to hope uh to talk about.

177
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,479
I'm going to read just a little bit.

178
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:24,479
He says, here's he's saying to Hawthorne that, I mean, you got to know that that there were the big religion around at Nelville's time was pantheism, which was that God was in everything, and there was a kind of soul, one big soul in everything.

179
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:26,799
And you could get in touch with that soul.

180
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,799
It was called transcendentalism.

181
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:35,839
It was a kind of onto theology without a supreme being, or maybe everything was the supreme being, I guess.

182
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:39,600
What he has to say about it is sort of interesting and funny.

183
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,079
He says, this all feeling, there is some truth in it.

184
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,319
You must have often felt it lying on the grass on a warm summer's day.

185
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:51,039
Your legs seem to send out shoots into the earth.

186
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,599
Your hair feels like leaves on your head.

187
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,680
This is the all feeling.

188
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:05,680
But what plays the mischief with the truth is that men will insist upon the universal application of a temporary feeling.

189
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,080
In other words, that's another perspective.

190
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,839
That's another interpretation.

191
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,119
And you can be in the mood of merging with the all of the universe.

192
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:23,759
But the mistake is to say, onto theologically, metaphysically, philosophically, or whatever, that's the truth.

193
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:24,880
Now I understand.

194
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,559
I'm part of the all.

195
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,879
That's the, what does he call it, mischief?

196
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,119
That's the mischief, meaning that's where you go wrong and get into trouble.

197
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:42,559
Now, I'm still sort of collecting bits of what I take to be Ishmael's way of being.

198
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:52,639
And so we've talked about his moodiness, his task, eagleness, his not getting stuck in any mood.

199
00:21:52,640 --> 00:22:01,800
Now, there is also, remember, in the squeeze of the hand chapter, a list on 403 in here.

200
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,319
403 back.

201
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,360
Why what?

202
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,280
There isn't even any 403 in here.

203
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,320
Is it in here?

204
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,600
No, no, I don't.

205
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:19,479
I've got about five different versions of Moby Dick, and every once in a while I get caught up in some other one, but I'm supposed to keep track of which one I'm in.

206
00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:20,360
Well, it doesn't matter.

207
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,640
We ought to be able to find it.

208
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,599
Look in the chapter, The Squeeze of the Hand.

209
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,200
And tell me somebody when you find it.

210
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,519
Harder to find than one would think.

211
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,559
402.

212
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:34,360
Okay.

213
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,160
So that's chapter 94.

214
00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:49,800
And remember that he says that you should lower your conceit of attainable felicity.

215
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:54,759
This is the bottom of 403, about a page and a half into chapter 94.

216
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:59,800
And then he lists these worlds or moods.

217
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:18,759
I think that's pretty much the same thing you can in which you could be in for a while, which is wife, heart, which I gonna read friendship, bed, Aphrodite, sex, the table, food, the saddle, the fireside, the country.

218
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:25,559
That's sort of the way the Athenians were when patriotism was the top thing, and so forth.

219
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:32,119
Now, what's interesting is Nietzsche comes up with his list.

220
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:39,239
And his list is somewhat different, but the the feel of it is the same.

221
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,559
Aha.

222
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,160
Maybe 403 is the place, no?

223
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:51,279
So there's some other person took over my life.

224
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,120
Where is brief habits in here?

225
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,639
Oh, that's over here.

226
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,680
That's why I don't.

227
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:58,400
So on your sheet of Nietzsche quotes now.

228
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:01,359
Can I have a copy of the sheet of Nietzsche quotes?

229
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,160
Did we use them?

230
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:02,959
Oh.

231
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:11,200
Okay, now, looking at the brief habits here, you'll see, let me just tell you what you should look for.

232
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:23,999
What's characteristic of moods and what the Greeks were already on to with their understanding of Thrusis, remember, of being, is that they well up, they linger a while, and then they go away.

233
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:27,200
And that that's their, and you shouldn't sort of fight it.

234
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,559
That's how moods are, and you should let them do that.

235
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,039
Well, Nietzsche has the same view.

236
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:35,280
I'm going to read the brief habits quote.

237
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,879
I always believe that there's something that will give me lasting satisfaction.

238
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:46,719
Brief habits, too, have this faith of passion, this faith in eternity, and that I am to be envied for having found and recognized it.

239
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:55,920
Think of this as what you experience when you experience any of these cases, of which squeezing of the hand turns out to be the paradigm case.

240
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:14,639
Once he's in it, he feels that it's just wonderful, and you couldn't be better, and he's totally satisfied, and it nourishes me at noon and in the evening and spreads a deep contentment all around itself and deep into me so that I desire nothing else without having any need for comparisons, contempt, or hatred.

241
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,719
That one day its time is up.

242
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:24,400
The good thing parts from me, not as something that's come to nauseate me, but peacefully and faded with me as I am with it.

243
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,759
That's what happens to me with, by the way.

244
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,840
And so that's supposed to be what happens with moods.

245
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,519
They come up, they well over you, they seem to cover the whole world.

246
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,200
They are the atmosphere in which you live.

247
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,719
If they're good moods, then you feel very, very grateful and happy with them.

248
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:44,759
And then comes his list of them, which is a funny list.

249
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:56,359
This happens to me with dishes, ideas, human beings, cities, poems, music, doctrines, ways of arranging the day, and lifestyles.

250
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,239
I don't know what to say about that.

251
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,719
They're not really Melville-like for two reasons, I think.

252
00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:07,160
They don't seem quite to be moods, although there's some overlap.

253
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:13,319
Dishes, that is, food dishes and the table are related.

254
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:18,039
Ideas, human beings, well, maybe that's friendship.

255
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:21,239
Cities, poems, music.

256
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:22,119
I don't know.

257
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:35,159
What I think, I think the main difference between the two lists is that it's clearer in Melville that things go with kinds of worlds.

258
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:46,680
There's the domestic world, there's the horseback world, there's the world of patriotism, there's the world of eroticism, and they don't seem to line up much with worlds in Nietzsche.

259
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:57,639
And the other thing is the Nietzsche ones, and you might be not surprised if you knew that Nietzsche lived all by himself up high in the Swiss Alps and was quite a loner.

260
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,879
And these all seem like loner things, except the one with hum with human beings.

261
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:14,080
But I think that Nietzsche's list i is not got the right, not the Melville sense that these are worlds and that they're shared.

262
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:22,879
His list is a list of worlds like the squeezing of the sperm.

263
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,680
It's a world in which you share it with everybody, with the other people in it.

264
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:33,599
And part of the satisfaction and the joy of it is that you share it with other people in it.

265
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,039
And I bet that's going to have to be true of all of them.

266
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:48,319
And I think that's because I believe Ishmael or Melville, when they think of moods, don't think of private, fleeting experiences.

267
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:49,520
Although there can be.

268
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:56,160
You can feel sort of giddy for an hour or two and nobody's around and it doesn't last and it doesn't connect.

269
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:09,840
But I mean, the moods that Melville is interested in and Ishmael is talking about are moods that come over you, that's the welling up, take you over, draw you in.

270
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,879
You don't plan it.

271
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,320
The squeezing of the hand didn't, it wasn't that he expected to be swept up like that.

272
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:25,519
They come over you, they draw you in, they color your whole world, they draw you in with other people, and they go away after a while.

273
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:33,999
That's the brief habit thing I read, partly because it's the closest thing I know to Melville, but it's different.

274
00:28:33,999 --> 00:28:36,400
Different in an important way.

275
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,560
And I think the Melville one is more interesting.

276
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,079
At least it's more polytheistic.

277
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:43,920
If these are really a list of worlds, that's what we want to see.

278
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:50,159
And you could have a god for horses, horse people, maybe it's Diane, and so forth.

279
00:28:50,160 --> 00:29:02,600
Whereas it's hard to have a god for dishes and all these funny things, ideas, and the strange things that make Nietzsche grab Nietzsche and hold him and draw him in.

280
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:19,079
But the grabbing and the filling of a whole, of your whole experience, and then going away without being, you know, without having nauseated you, but also not upsetting you because you wanted them to last.

281
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,719
That structure I think he shares with Malco.

282
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:25,239
Maybe we could try opening the door again.

283
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:26,519
Maybe they stop making noise.

284
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:31,880
I know maybe it's over, though, because I see people fanning as if they are going to pass out.

285
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,839
If it isn't over, we have to leave it.

286
00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:37,719
They go home sometimes, though.

287
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:38,680
It's okay.

288
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,999
They usually stop around this time.

289
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,719
Their day is over, let's hope.

290
00:29:43,719 --> 00:29:44,519
Okay.

291
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,279
Where are we?

292
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:53,559
So, and now again, Ishmael is respectful of all the resources of all the world's cultures.

293
00:29:53,559 --> 00:30:12,279
And as long as they aren't taken for objective truth, as long as they aren't totalizing, as soon as they are, like pantheism, as soon as the feeling of lying on the grass and being one with the world is taken as the truth, the feeling that really reveals reality, then he's going to laugh at it.

294
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,680
He laughs at Emerson in another book of his called The Confidence Man.

295
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:26,440
Fans of pantheism and big enemies of, I don't know if you knew him personally, but he was a kind of intellectual enemy of Melville.

296
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:37,319
So, and I'm telling you always too, I want to sort of emphasize, look, this book is nearer the Odyssey than anything else written, probably.

297
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:57,440
And that's why we read the Odyssey at the beginning and this at the end, because there you go from the Homeric kind of pantheism to the Melville kind of pantheism, having passed through all the forms of the o of single gods or more and more single gods.

298
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,879
There are two in Aeschylus, remember.

299
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,200
There's just Augustus in Virgil.

300
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,319
There's the Supreme Being in Dante.

301
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:14,160
And then you get somebody who has this Homeric view.

302
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:23,200
So like Odysseus, it's clear that Ishmael is a cross-world person, at home on the land and in the sea and in any culture.

303
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,400
He has no, but he's even more, and that's because it's the modern world.

304
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,080
And the modern world, he doesn't have any home anymore.

305
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,840
He doesn't have any center.

306
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,639
He doesn't have any place that he's going.

307
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:42,639
There's no kingdom that and he's not a father and he's got no kids.

308
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,559
In other words, that we're back to he's a wanderer and he's an orphan.

309
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,160
He's sort of Odysseus.

310
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:58,319
If Odysseus was sort of full-time the way you see him in the book at the beginning when he's just wandering around sort of experiencing things.

311
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,520
So Melville's more radical than Homer.

312
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:14,239
He thinks you can't go back to after you've become a wanderer to go being rooted in your island with your bed in it made out of a tree, you know, and ground and roots in the ground.

313
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:15,600
There are no roots.

314
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,280
Ishmael is utterly unrooted.

315
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:21,759
And the modern world is getting more and more like that.

316
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:35,239
And that's why if you's going to be a kind of a host mod, if you're going to have a kind of polytheistic identity, you can't have father and son and kingdom in it.

317
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:38,680
So Ishmael's not committed to any set of worlds.

318
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,920
He has no home base.

319
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:47,799
But he isn't just disinterestedly curious, collecting experiences.

320
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:58,920
Now, who thinks that Odysseus is just collecting experiences, sort of not really getting involved even temporarily at all in these experiences?

321
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,519
Just an observer?

322
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,639
Where do we hear Odysseus described that way?

323
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:05,879
Now, there are so many things to remember.

324
00:33:05,879 --> 00:33:06,520
Yeah.

325
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,200
Right, right.

326
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:26,920
And in the Tanto in the Inferno, where Odysseus is in there for false counseling by telling his sailors that the highest things human beings can do is become sort of observers of all sorts of worlds and all sorts of experience.

327
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:54,519
Now, Ishmael also thinks that it's right to do something with all sorts of worlds and all sorts of experience, but not just be observers for it, not just because it's another experience, another form of entertainment, but because while you're drawn into it, it gives you a world, it gives your life meaning, it's the best thing that can happen to you.

328
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:58,280
It's a divine intuition, it's a divine magnanimity.

329
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:03,960
And that's not what Dante thinks Odysseus is up to.

330
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:11,319
Now, it just occurs to me to ask myself, and you, and what does Homer think Odyssey is up to?

331
00:34:11,319 --> 00:34:15,039
Is he letting himself be drawn into these worlds?

332
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:26,880
Yes, when he goes and lives with Calypso or he gets into these complicated games with the Phaeacians and so forth.

333
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,919
He does go and take part in the world.

334
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:34,799
He's not just observing, and he's certainly not laughing at them.

335
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:39,680
But there's something there.

336
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,520
I think it's something like, it's not an end in itself.

337
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:51,119
I mean, the point for Odysseus, it's interesting, I try to understand Homer.

338
00:34:51,120 --> 00:35:05,919
The point for Odysseus is not to have a temporary world that gives you meaning, like the brief habits or like the list under the squeeze of the hand.

339
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:13,040
It isn't something that draws you in, gives you a whole world with meaning, and then leaves you again.

340
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:27,520
He doesn't ever get that involved because he's always got this other thing of getting home, of really belonging with Penelope and so forth on his island, or going to see his father in Hades.

341
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:34,960
So Odysseus is something, I don't know how to even put it, Odysseus is something between an observer.

342
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,879
Dante had it sort of on a whole pathway.

343
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,600
He's something like a collector of worlds.

344
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:50,800
That Ishmael has got some of Odyssey in him, but it's neither of those.

345
00:35:50,799 --> 00:35:52,879
It's, hmm, here's something.

346
00:35:52,879 --> 00:35:54,399
I don't know where it's going to lead.

347
00:35:54,399 --> 00:36:05,719
But the worlds that Odysseus can get aren't the Phaeacians' world and the, what did I say, Calypso's world and so forth.

348
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:10,520
The only worlds available to Odysseus, which he also visits.

349
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,080
And there, he does more than visit them.

350
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:22,839
He really gets into them is the war world when he's in the aggressive stance of Aries, or do we see him in any other world?

351
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:34,280
Well, the domestic world when he finally gets home and we see him finally telling his life story in bed with Penelope or mentoring Telemachus.

352
00:36:34,919 --> 00:36:36,759
Those are worlds.

353
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:54,120
Odysse gets into those worlds, presumably, by being drawn in, and they do get his life meaning when he's being a warrior or when he's taking over his castle, being the super king and super domestic.

354
00:36:54,120 --> 00:37:03,560
Those are the right, those are the sort of kind of polytheistic things that Melville would like.

355
00:37:03,879 --> 00:37:05,479
Yeah, I can't say more about it.

356
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,999
It's Odysseus, what?

357
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:31,719
If you took away the rooted bed in the family as somehow the superior mood, the really right getting in touch with re the deepest getting in touch with reality, if you treated all Atacis as equal, anything can draw you in, be a world, and give your life meaning for a while.

358
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:33,719
See, it's that for the while, too.

359
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:40,280
It's all so much more general, that is, anything can do it.

360
00:37:40,279 --> 00:37:42,399
I'm talking about the Ishmael world now.

361
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:47,919
Anything can become a mood or a world and you've got to be ready to let it go.

362
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,000
And it's not that's different.

363
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:01,040
Although notice the way Odysseus apparently is happy with Calypso for a while, but after a year he gets bored and he's ready to let it go.

364
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:13,759
There's a lot of common feel for the experience of being drawn in and then satisfied and then going on.

365
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,519
Okay, I can't say more about it.

366
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,040
I just think it's interesting.

367
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:25,520
And I bet there's a moral to be said, but now I'll if I think of it, I'll say it next time, if there were a next time.

368
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,000
Next time I give it, I guess.

369
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,879
And maybe somebody's going to come to office hours and tell me more what the moral is.

370
00:38:32,879 --> 00:38:36,479
Ah, David, I feel I'm about to get at something and I don't know what.

371
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,479
He got rid of that.

372
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,759
You mean that he puts that behind him in some way?

373
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,160
Where is he coming home?

374
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,919
He travels home to himself.

375
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:00,879
Oh, no, I I don't want to say that.

376
00:39:00,879 --> 00:39:04,719
I think he's going to be drizzly again just because moods are like that.

377
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:06,079
He was in a grumpy mood.

378
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:11,279
It isn't as if now he's found sort of a deeper truth so he's not going to be at the end of heaven.

379
00:39:12,319 --> 00:39:13,839
Okay, good, good, right, that's right.

380
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,200
Well, that's what I'm saying, too.

381
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,960
That's another way to say it.

382
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,319
There isn't any homecoming.

383
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:19,759
There isn't any island.

384
00:39:19,759 --> 00:39:25,680
There isn't any self at all, any job at all, any identity at all.

385
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:41,160
Ishmael has none at the beginning of the book, and when he's an orphan at the end of the book, he is pure openness, pure attuning, receptivity to what draws him in and gives him meaning for a while.

386
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,799
That's his, that's him, I think.

387
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,759
That's what I want to call, he's the truly polytheistic person.

388
00:39:48,759 --> 00:40:01,479
Odysse hasn't quite arrived at being fully polytheistic in that sense of being open to every divinity that the divine intuitions could all be called divinities if you want.

389
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:08,440
And he's open to every divinity any culture can offer or any time of day can offer or it just happens to you.

390
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:09,000
Yeah.

391
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,759
Polyphenus, the cyclop.

392
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,439
No, because he doesn't have her because he did it on his own, right?

393
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:29,239
Yeah.

394
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,759
Okay, well, that's, and that's the question of being a cross-world person.

395
00:40:32,759 --> 00:40:34,040
So let's think about that.

396
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:39,960
Odyssey, I think that's probably very important for what I'm trying to say.

397
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:56,440
Remember, I wanted some third thing, not just doing it for experience, but not doing it because when you're in it, it seems totally satisfying and meaningful to you.

398
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,680
Odysseus sort of is defined as the cross-world person.

399
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,239
I mean, that's the sense in which Athena's with him.

400
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:09,960
I mean, the important thing for him is to be able, I think, to go from world to world and adapt.

401
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:25,200
So his moods are generally suspicious when he arrives, and then he's sort of citing things out, and then he's sort of gets in tune with whatever the current mood is, like the dinner party at the Phaeacians and so forth.

402
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:42,880
But what's what gives him guidance is that Athena, and of course, with the agreement of Zeus, makes him a person who is able to go from world to world.

403
00:41:42,879 --> 00:42:01,440
And he, that sort of, it isn't that Ishmael goes from world to world, he does do that, but it's that he's able to live in these, each world fully and experience everything from that perspective.

404
00:42:01,439 --> 00:42:04,879
I don't think that's the point for Odysseus.

405
00:42:04,879 --> 00:42:12,160
The point for Odysseus is to be a wanderer all right.

406
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:22,560
But it's the it's funny, it's hard to put, but I think for Odysseus, it's the wandering itself, which is the point.

407
00:42:22,879 --> 00:42:32,000
Whereas for Ishmael, it's where you stop as you wander and get in and get drawn in, which is the point.

408
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:41,680
The first sentence of the Odyssey is, I forget how it goes exactly, but it's the famous word is polytropi.

409
00:42:42,879 --> 00:42:53,120
The muse is singing of Odysseus polytropai, which means wanderer and also clever.

410
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:59,079
And it's the cross-world word, presumably.

411
00:42:56,799 --> 00:43:03,400
Adaptable to every world, I think, would be a way of translating it, probably.

412
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:15,239
And the emphasis for Ishmael is something like being able to be attuned to all these.

413
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:26,520
But it's not because he's been able to be attuned to lots of different worlds, but that he's able to get into them, into the world he's in, whatever one it is.

414
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,519
Boy, is that a it's either a very subtle difference or an important difference.

415
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,239
I can't tell.

416
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:31,559
Yeah.

417
00:43:33,799 --> 00:43:34,680
That's right.

418
00:43:37,799 --> 00:43:43,319
Even though he has all of this with a business every world, but it's also involved.

419
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,399
People are fine and using that.

420
00:43:45,399 --> 00:43:48,280
Well, I have another way to graduate.

421
00:43:48,279 --> 00:43:53,640
But he thinks he's gone into all the different baldness and he can't really think about it.

422
00:43:54,439 --> 00:43:56,120
I think that's interesting.

423
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,400
That might be right.

424
00:43:57,399 --> 00:43:59,080
I think that's important.

425
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:04,040
That his that I'm going to come back to that.

426
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:14,759
I think it's a big difference whether you've got a culture which has a certain set of gods or whether you're outside of all any particular culture going from culture to culture.

427
00:44:14,759 --> 00:44:21,080
And that is one of the big differences between them, which is certainly related to what I'm saying.

428
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:21,799
Okay.

429
00:44:22,439 --> 00:44:23,559
Let's see now.

430
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:26,839
Ishmael.

431
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,040
Okay, yeah, okay.

432
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:36,920
Odysseus, I just wrote here, is suspicious, curious, always worrying about his own survival and the survival of his crew.

433
00:44:36,919 --> 00:44:39,640
That feels very different, for better or for worse.

434
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:57,280
I don't know what to do with it, than what when Ishmael says at the beginning of the book, I read this long ago, that he wants to be sociable with all the strange cultures and people he comes across on page six, the end of chapter one.

435
00:44:57,919 --> 00:44:59,599
Not ignoring the good.

436
00:44:59,919 --> 00:45:09,919
I'm quick to perceive a horror, could still be social with it, would they let me, since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in.

437
00:45:09,919 --> 00:45:17,840
That means sort of you should get attuned to every everywhere that you could go in the world, I think.

438
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:19,040
Okay, I want to jump ahead.

439
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:26,719
I'm afraid timing, I can't wait, you know, I can't talk after five because there's no next lecture, so I want to jump ahead.

440
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:42,719
But I want to just say that this, that one more thing, whereas Odysseus, it seems to me, is always sort of outside of and what where he is, another way to put it is that Ishmael can be contented.

441
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:46,800
I think Ishmael feels at home wherever he goes.

442
00:45:46,799 --> 00:45:51,200
I don't think Odysseus feels at home wherever he goes, partly because he's got a home.

443
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,120
If you haven't got a home, then you can feel at home wherever you go.

444
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,080
That's one of the things I'm trying to get at.

445
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:14,400
And the word for this feeling at home that I'm making up, so to speak, but remember I said and I brought it to read it this time, this important notion that the basic feeling of Ishmael is that he's contented.

446
00:46:14,399 --> 00:46:16,640
He says, content.

447
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,839
That's it.

448
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,960
A strange feeling, no hopelessness is in it, no despair.

449
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,719
I speak now of my profoundest sense of being, not an incidental feeling.

450
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:36,680
So this, I don't, contentment doesn't seem to be the right basic feeling for Odysseus, does it?

451
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:41,800
It looks like it's sort of restlessness.

452
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,800
Sometimes because he wants to see more, sometimes because he wants to get home.

453
00:46:45,799 --> 00:46:53,479
I don't think Odysseus is content until he's in bed with Penelope, having got his castle back and his son back, and then he is content.

454
00:46:53,480 --> 00:47:01,719
But the interesting thing again is Ishmael's content all the time, wherever he is, whenever he makes himself at home.

455
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:08,520
Now I went mainly to talk about polytheism, and I haven't got there yet, so I'm going to go there in a hurry now.

456
00:47:10,359 --> 00:47:24,440
Meldill had one important quote, which I'm not clear that I understand how to interpret, but I will tell you sort of why I think it's interesting and why it needs to be interpreted.

457
00:47:24,439 --> 00:47:26,200
I think I've already quoted it once.

458
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:41,080
At the bottom of 336, the end of chapter 79, the quote that in a certain way is why I put the book in the Course, is where he's saying, if hereafter a highly cultured, are they making all that noise again?

459
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,560
Are they making that noise coming again from them?

460
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,279
I'm afraid so.

461
00:47:44,279 --> 00:47:45,640
Sorry, I guess wrong.

462
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,560
But people stopped banning themselves for a while.

463
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,000
It got cooler anyway.

464
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,200
Okay, here we go again.

465
00:47:52,200 --> 00:48:18,399
If hereafter any highly cultured poetical nation shall lure back to their birthright, the Merry May Day gods of old, that's the funny way of referring to the Pantheon of gods, and livingly enthroned again in the now egotistical sky, that's our modern sky, meaning in our world we're all subjects, sort of imposing meaning on things.

466
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:19,439
I'll come back to that in a minute.

467
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:24,959
In the now unhaunted hill, that means nature is just what science says it is.

468
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,440
There's no mystery, no gods in nature.

469
00:48:27,439 --> 00:48:34,320
Then, to be sure, exalted to Jove's, let's say Zeus's high seat, the great sperm whale shall lord it.

470
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:37,200
Now, that's the quote that's interesting.

471
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:54,080
Melville either wishes the Pantheon would come back, something like the old pantheon would come back, or longs for the old pantheon to come back, or just happens, just considering if it did ever come back, then Moby Dick would lord it.

472
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,919
I don't know for sure.

473
00:48:57,919 --> 00:49:00,239
But certainly, this much is true.

474
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:15,360
Melville admires and likes polytheism, and he likes it in its current form, which is Ishmael running around trying all these divine intuitions.

475
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:21,759
But he likes it even better, I think, although I'm not sure, in the Greek form.

476
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:33,440
My hunch that he likes it better is I think he'd find the sky better if it wasn't so egotistical, and I think he would find the nature better if it weren't so disenchanted.

477
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:50,239
But now I want to read why, and this is, if I don't get any further than this, this is the main thing I want to read, and that is contrast the polytheism of Homer and Melville with the polytheism of Nietzsche.

478
00:49:50,399 --> 00:49:51,920
You have it on your page there.

479
00:49:51,919 --> 00:49:56,799
Nietzsche suddenly says he's going to tell us the advantages of polytheism.

480
00:49:56,919 --> 00:50:10,920
And I have a long quote: For an individual to posit his own ideal and derive from it his own law, joys, and rights, that may well have been considered hitherto the most outrageous human aberration as idolatry itself.

481
00:50:10,919 --> 00:50:21,719
Posit means that you just give something the meaning that you want to give it, and you make the laws, and you then get the joy.

482
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:24,360
That's what I've been calling autonomy.

483
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:32,200
That's the modern subject in its form of being the source of meaning, the willful source of meaning.

484
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:39,480
That we take the place of God, we become the supreme being, we give meaning to everything.

485
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,919
That's Melville's view.

486
00:50:40,919 --> 00:50:44,279
Melville is an activist, voluntarist.

487
00:50:44,359 --> 00:50:47,400
There are words for this willful person.

488
00:50:47,399 --> 00:50:57,000
According to the way Heidegger thinks about it, that's one stage beyond the never mind.

489
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,200
I don't think I should say that.

490
00:50:58,839 --> 00:51:08,520
He goes on: the wonderful art and gift of creating gods, polytheism, was the medium through which this impulse could discharge it and perfect and ennoble itself.

491
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:14,200
Namely, this impulse of making up your own laws, making up your own meaning.

492
00:51:14,919 --> 00:51:16,679
The bad thing was before that.

493
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:22,600
There was only one norm, man, and every people thought that it possessed this one ultimate norm.

494
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:27,640
That's the way there was always an idea of how people should behave in any culture.

495
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:34,200
But above and outside, in some overworld, one was permitted to behold a plurality of norms.

496
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,959
One god, now think about the Greek gods, the power- the Homeric gods.

497
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:42,799
One god was not considered a denial of another god, nor blasphemy against him.

498
00:51:43,200 --> 00:52:01,200
So you can have Aphrodite in the erotic, and you can have Helen, and she was in that erotic, but she was also under Hera in the domestic, and you have Aries, and these gods are you don't have to have one answer to what the right way to live is, the right form of life is.

499
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:15,759
So the invention of gods and heroes and overmen of all kinds, big list here, was the inestimable preliminary exercise for the justification of egoism and the sovereignty of the individual.

500
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:17,519
That's Nietzsche.

501
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,200
That's not Melville.

502
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,600
That's got no receptivity.

503
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:31,279
He's not talking about attunements to gods, attunements to worlds, where you are receptive to what's going on.

504
00:52:31,279 --> 00:52:35,440
He says people invent gods, invent worlds, and so forth.

505
00:52:35,439 --> 00:52:37,040
Now go on with that.

506
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:49,840
In polytheism, the free-spiriting, many-spiriting of man attained its preliminary form, the strength to create for ourselves our own eyes, ever new eyes with ever more their own.

507
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:54,480
Hence, man alone among all animals, that's enough.

508
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:56,719
But there's a little more, the bad thing.

509
00:52:56,719 --> 00:53:00,160
I want to go back, look at the beginning of the paragraph I just read.

510
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:15,920
Monotheism, on the other hand, this rigid consequence of the doctrine of one normal human type, faith in one normal God, that's the supreme being, besides whom there are only pseudo-gods, was perhaps the greatest danger that yet confronted humanity.

511
00:53:15,919 --> 00:53:32,839
Okay, so I think Melville and Nietzsche agree that onto theology, monotheism from their point of view is this great danger, that there's only one perspective, one truth, one right way to be a human being, and so forth.

512
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:45,160
And that the great thing is that people, that polytheism denies that, gives people a plurality of good lives, for instance.

513
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,279
Now I'm going to take sort of Melville's side.

514
00:53:48,279 --> 00:53:56,200
I think Melville is better than Nietzsche because Nietzsche thinks that you can just make up gods and you posit them.

515
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:04,040
You are autonomous and you freely give them meaning and you can give any God, you can pick your own God and give it meaning and that's fine.

516
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,040
What's wrong with that view?

517
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:12,759
Well, what's wrong with it is that if you posit the meaning, then it won't have any authority for you.

518
00:54:12,759 --> 00:54:22,599
It won't be something in your life that you have to be open to, be controlled by, but don't control.

519
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:30,120
I mean, Helen couldn't go around positing the eroticness of the scene with Paris.

520
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:39,480
That wouldn't have, if she had, she would have no right to go away and leave her husband and child just because she made up an erotic scene.

521
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:50,200
It's got to be experienced as something independent of you, which draws you in and has authority over you while it happens.

522
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,799
That's why it's divine.

523
00:54:51,799 --> 00:54:53,799
That's what's sacred about it.

524
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,839
That's what's healing about it, if it's healing.

525
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,680
You never can tell.

526
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:03,719
There's not enough about that in this book for me to be able to figure out how healing it is.

527
00:55:03,719 --> 00:55:07,400
But in any case, that's what's special about it.

528
00:55:07,399 --> 00:55:09,319
And it's just what Nietzsche misses.

529
00:55:09,319 --> 00:55:12,200
Nietzsche, and here's a funny way to put it.

530
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:22,160
I mean, the enemy of Homeric polytheism or Melville polytheism, there are two enemies.

531
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:28,080
There's the onto-theology that there's only one mood, only one world, and so forth.

532
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:35,680
That's the, so to speak, traditional wrong, at least as far as Virgil.

533
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:42,160
But then there's the modern wrongness, which is the autonomy thing.

534
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:50,000
The two mistakes are that there's only one answer, or that there's a plurality of meanings, and they're all up to us.

535
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,480
We've taken the place of the Supreme Being.

536
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:56,719
With our will, we can give anything any meaning we please.

537
00:55:56,719 --> 00:55:58,160
And isn't that wonderful?

538
00:55:58,879 --> 00:56:00,959
That I think is the Nietzschean mistake.

539
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:09,440
So there's the sort of pre-modern mistake, Dante, Supreme Being, leveling all the meanings.

540
00:56:09,439 --> 00:56:22,080
Then there's the modern mistake, the Descartes-Kant subject who has taken the place of the Supreme Being, but now gets rid of all mattering.

541
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,000
That's another way to put it.

542
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,599
If you posit the meaning of things, then it doesn't really matter to you.

543
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:31,280
It's just made up by you, and you can just get rid of it again.

544
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:35,759
Think of just to take sort of romantic love as an example.

545
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:42,560
You can't just go around and posit somebody as the one you're going to love, and then it wouldn't have any grip on you.

546
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,480
It wouldn't really matter to you.

547
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:49,440
You could just posit them as no longer somebody you love, and then that would be fine.

548
00:56:49,759 --> 00:57:00,200
It's sort of like living in a virtual world as opposed to the real world where you just make up whatever happens, and if you don't like what the world you made up, then you just drop it and make up another one.

549
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:01,640
That's how it looks at Nietzsche.

550
00:57:01,879 --> 00:57:05,640
Okay, now, having said that, I want to see what I am.

551
00:57:05,879 --> 00:57:16,280
Okay, so Nietzsche wants to return to polytheism, but he's got a wrong from Melville, and I must agree, point of view about what's interesting about polytheism.

552
00:57:16,279 --> 00:57:22,440
He goes, he uses it, here's another way to put it, as a weapon against monotheism.

553
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:23,640
Remember, I read that part.

554
00:57:23,799 --> 00:57:29,480
Monotheism says one answer, one truth, one understanding of what human beings are up to.

555
00:57:29,719 --> 00:57:36,120
But Nietzsche uses it as an answer to monotheism, and he gets, and he bases it on autonomy.

556
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:39,640
But autonomy is just the next stage of monotheism.

557
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:45,080
The individual subject is the supreme being, giving meaning to everything.

558
00:57:46,359 --> 00:57:47,879
There'd be nothing sacred.

559
00:57:47,879 --> 00:57:50,200
Nothing would have authority for you.

560
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:50,999
Okay.

561
00:57:51,319 --> 00:58:02,440
The kind of mood that Melville is interested in would be like the contagious mood at a party, which you can't posit, and when it's happening, you can't make it go away.

562
00:58:02,439 --> 00:58:11,640
You can't, your moods, that's what's interesting about the moods, is that there's something that has authority over you, that makes things matter for you.

563
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:18,120
That's the sense in which it's divine, even a party, in the Melville view.

564
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:30,840
The mood of a party is contagious, and it whooshes up and it lasts for a while, and it goes away, and it draws you in, and while you're in it, it's the party that's your world.

565
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:35,080
And the same thing for the squeeze of the hand, of course.

566
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:41,080
And that means that for Ishmael, moods aren't private and psychological.

567
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,320
They're cultural possibilities.

568
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:55,120
The kind of parties you can have, the kind of friendship, the kind of love, the kind of rituals you can have depends on the culture.

569
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:03,840
And the moods are ontological, not psychological, in that they cover the whole world.

570
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:06,400
They're not inner, fleeting things.

571
00:59:06,399 --> 00:59:09,920
They're shared atmospheres.

572
00:59:09,919 --> 00:59:13,520
And you can't summon them up by will, and they have authority for you.

573
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,279
Okay, let's see what I can.

574
00:59:15,759 --> 00:59:18,560
That's why they're divine magnanimities.

575
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:26,160
And don't sort of poo-poo them, I think Ishmael would say, because after all, they're not like vocations.

576
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:31,280
They're not like a love that's eternal or a commitment that's eternal.

577
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:38,959
The commitment that's eternal, remember, is Father Mappel's story, that Jonah had a calling and it was his calling for life and he had to do it.

578
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,560
And if he didn't do it, his life was going to be awful inside the whale.

579
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:45,120
Finally, he gets spit up and does it.

580
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:51,839
So the idea here is that there aren't somehow such callings.

581
00:59:51,839 --> 01:00:10,480
I don't know whether Ishmael thinks they don't appeal to him, whether he thinks there really are such callings or whether he thinks, like Nietzsche does, that they're fanatical or like Virgil does, like Virgil thinks romantic love, what might have been romantic love on Dido's part, is just madness and fanaticism.

582
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:20,880
I don't know what it isn't clear what Ishmael thinks of Father Mappel's Kierkegaardian sermon that you should be committed to something for your whole life.

583
01:00:20,879 --> 01:00:27,200
But if you are, that gets in the way of the moods because they look trivial compared to that kind of commitment.

584
01:00:27,319 --> 01:00:40,999
But if you think that that kind of commitment is either impossible or dangerous fanaticism, some kind of blindness, commitments or prisons, Nietzsche says, then you're open to ontological moods.

585
01:00:41,719 --> 01:00:44,599
That's where Ishmael is.

586
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:47,640
It's not a question for Ishmael of will.

587
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:51,239
It's a question of openness and attunement.

588
01:00:52,279 --> 01:00:54,280
That's the divine part.

589
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:59,480
So then comes the next question I want to ask, and this is the last one.

590
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:06,120
What is Melville longing for the return of Greek, of Homeric polytheism?

591
01:01:06,439 --> 01:01:08,039
And if so, why?

592
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,399
What's wrong with his kind?

593
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:14,600
What does his kind of polytheism lack that Homeric polytheism had?

594
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,159
One.

595
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,480
And second, does he think we could get it?

596
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:20,039
And oh, well, second, does he think we should get it back?

597
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:22,680
And then finally, does he think we could get it back?

598
01:01:23,239 --> 01:01:26,599
I don't really know, but I've got ideas about it.

599
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:30,680
So I'll tell you what I think, and then you can tell me what you think.

600
01:01:31,319 --> 01:01:36,839
So why wouldn't it work, the Homeric Khan?

601
01:01:36,839 --> 01:01:39,400
Well, that's what Kevin back there was on to.

602
01:01:39,879 --> 01:01:43,960
For the Homeric Greeks, these worlds supported each other.

603
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:44,599
Remember?

604
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:50,600
They all had a family resemblance, a common style, and they were all interrelated.

605
01:01:50,600 --> 01:02:00,920
So that, you remember, at the dinner party you sang about the heroes and about the love affairs, and in the wars, you fought because they sang about you.

606
01:02:00,919 --> 01:02:05,880
And I just discovered another funny overlap, funny because it's sort of weird.

607
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:11,320
Athena is not only a cross-world goddess, but she's the goddess of weaving.

608
01:02:11,319 --> 01:02:13,200
Doesn't that sound strange?

609
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:28,319
So it's the same intuition that Melville has, that somehow the gods in the polytheistic world are interconnected and intertwined in some way.

610
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:36,159
And she's, as the cross-world person, actually the one who's the goddess of the intertwining, I think.

611
01:02:36,879 --> 01:02:39,040
And for Ishmael, they're not.

612
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,039
They're just lots of gods all over.

613
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:47,920
There's still a weaver god who somehow manages, I don't know how to put it, to hold the whole thing together.

614
01:02:47,919 --> 01:02:56,479
But it's not held together in the tight, interconnected way that the Homeric world and its pantheon was held together.

615
01:02:57,759 --> 01:03:05,040
So another way to put it is the Homeric Greeks agreed in their culture about what moods were important.

616
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:08,480
The ones that had the gods representing them.

617
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:18,160
Love, domestic, love erotic, war, aggression, technology with Hephaestus, domestic with Hera, and so forth.

618
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,000
Those were the important moods.

619
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:31,279
There wasn't a mood for, let's think of something like, hmm, think of a mood, well, patriotism that comes in later with Aeschylus.

620
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:39,519
Aespelus invents it, or tells the Athenians they've invented it, and helps them, makes it real by telling them.

621
01:03:39,759 --> 01:03:49,840
That holds it up to them that they've made a city so amazing that they all should love it and put it ahead of everything.

622
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:53,840
And the more they love it and put it ahead of everything, the more amazing it becomes.

623
01:03:54,399 --> 01:03:58,600
That's fine, but that's another culture already.

624
01:03:58,919 --> 01:04:13,000
There isn't any, for the Homeric Greeks, patriotism isn't a god, and of course, neither is duty, the Virgil, the supreme mood or supreme rule of behavior or something.

625
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:35,400
So you get a culture that selects a certain bunch of worlds or moods, focuses them, makes them central, interrelates them, sees that they've got a common style, even though they're different, and that is what we can't have, what Ishmael can.

626
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:41,960
Now, I don't know whether we've got to have it or not.

627
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:48,919
So, an open question is whether that certainly must have healed people in Homer time.

628
01:04:48,919 --> 01:04:56,360
I don't think they were cracked about the head once they believed in their polytheism, which they did.

629
01:04:56,359 --> 01:05:17,800
But whether you have this much looser, opener kind of polytheism, where there is no bunch of moods which are the important ones, which everybody knows are the important ones, and are interrelated, woven together, and you can be a cross-world person among those moods.

630
01:05:19,879 --> 01:05:27,800
I don't know what it's whether what's left of polytheism is enough.

631
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:36,439
That's another way of saying, I don't know whether Ishmael, if it isn't enough, he's longing for the return of the gods, of the Homeric kind of gods.

632
01:05:36,439 --> 01:05:40,440
Of course, we're not going to get those gods, but some other pantheon.

633
01:05:40,439 --> 01:05:50,480
Maybe he thinks that you don't need a pantheon anymore, that his kind of polytheism, which we've just been describing, is enough.

634
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,399
Let me see now.

635
01:05:52,719 --> 01:05:55,040
So I was going to back up for a second.

636
01:05:55,040 --> 01:06:02,960
So why don't we all accept the current kind of polytheism that Ishmael experiences, that Melville actually lives?

637
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,839
Because he writes to, well, two reasons, I think.

638
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:08,559
We're still looking for a traditional total meaning.

639
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:09,759
That's Starbucks.

640
01:06:09,759 --> 01:06:11,680
He can't live in that.

641
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:18,640
Or if we don't have that total meaning, I'm back on the two ways to go wrong.

642
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:21,759
The onto-theological way, we still want to keep that.

643
01:06:21,759 --> 01:06:24,160
That would keep us from this kind of polytheism.

644
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:29,119
The other one is that we're egotistically imposing our individual meaning on everything.

645
01:06:29,439 --> 01:06:32,079
That's the Nietzsche one.

646
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:37,280
That gives us the egotistical sky, which Melville doesn't like.

647
01:06:37,279 --> 01:06:57,520
So the question is: if you collect meanings from all stages of our culture and from all other cultures, even though they don't fit together, even though they're not in any hierarchical form, even though we don't know which one, neither they're not ranked in terms of importance or anything like that, is that enough to be healing?

648
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,600
Is that holy?

649
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,040
It's divine.

650
01:07:02,399 --> 01:07:06,320
I don't know whether it's what it takes to be sacred and holy.

651
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:11,680
I think probably for Ishmael and Melville it is sacred and holy because it's divine.

652
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:25,359
In that case, what I really think is he thinks that it's enough to make it possible to lead a meaningful life to live Ishmael polytheism, Melville polytheism.

653
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:40,599
However, I think he thinks it would be even better for everybody if we had a Homeric kind of polytheism, because I think he doesn't like the egotistical sky, because it just gets our relation to moods and worlds wrong.

654
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:46,120
That's what Nietzsche's doing with all that willful, autonomous sky.

655
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:48,279
And he doesn't like the disenchanted hill.

656
01:07:48,279 --> 01:07:49,080
Nobody does.

657
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:58,439
I mean, there was this beautiful, wonderful nature full of all kinds of power and wonderful things pulling you in, and we've lost it.

658
01:07:58,439 --> 01:07:59,799
The wilderness is gone.

659
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:00,920
Do you read the bear?

660
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,559
Anybody read the Faulkner's The Bear anymore?

661
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:10,040
And it's all about the end of the wilderness, the end of the enchantedness.

662
01:08:10,279 --> 01:08:14,999
When the end of the book, the railroad is coming through and they're chopping down the wilderness.

663
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,919
So something feels wrong about that.

664
01:08:19,239 --> 01:08:23,639
So it looks like, let me catch up again.

665
01:08:23,639 --> 01:08:29,880
So the pagan worlds don't support each other the way the worlds do in the Homeric pantheon.

666
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,239
Don't resonate with each other.

667
01:08:31,239 --> 01:08:33,799
You're just attuned to this one and this one and this one.

668
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:38,679
And I think Ishmael must think that it would be great if they supported each other.

669
01:08:38,679 --> 01:08:41,239
That would be the May Day gods returning.

670
01:08:41,239 --> 01:08:45,639
And that, by the way, when the May Day gods return, I've got to say this, I forgot.

671
01:08:45,639 --> 01:08:50,120
Why is the sperm whale take the place of Zeus?

672
01:08:51,319 --> 01:08:54,519
Well, I said it, but it's important to say it again.

673
01:08:54,519 --> 01:08:56,279
Where are the May Day gods returning?

674
01:08:56,279 --> 01:08:57,880
363, is it?

675
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,080
Help me find it.

676
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,239
I keep finding it and losing it.

677
01:09:01,479 --> 01:09:03,239
336, okay.

678
01:09:03,559 --> 01:09:25,040
If you look on that page, what you see is that on the same page where he says that you need sort of Zeus to be in charge of this, one, I think, Zeus is sort of what makes possible the coordination between these worlds and how they support each other and how it's possible to go from world to world.

679
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:32,639
But I think that's not as important as the fact that, remember, that the whale is the unrepresentable.

680
01:09:32,639 --> 01:09:38,960
So the whale is what keeps you open to all the colors of the rainbow, all the various gods.

681
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:44,319
It's on the same page where he talks about these Zeus being the head of all the gods.

682
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:50,799
He says up above, the great sperm whale has got this big, mighty brow.

683
01:09:50,800 --> 01:10:04,959
You feel the deity and the dread powers more forcibly than any other object in living nature, for you see no one point precisely, not one distinct feature is revealed, no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth, no face.

684
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,920
It's again the same statement: the whale has no face.

685
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:12,319
It goes back to the whale picture in the Spouter Inn at the beginning of the book.

686
01:10:12,319 --> 01:10:29,359
It's because the whale keeps open the fact that there isn't any right answer, that it leaves you open to respond to all the colors of the rainbow, all of divine magnanimities, all the moods that are out there.

687
01:10:29,359 --> 01:10:31,040
That's the job.

688
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:44,639
And that's, and so the idea that you would have ideally, the Zeus, who is, as remember, Aeschylus says, not Homer, that is behind everything.

689
01:10:44,639 --> 01:10:49,519
That is the same as the boundless sea, that is the same as the sperm whale.

690
01:10:49,519 --> 01:10:51,999
It's the unrepresentable.

691
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:58,519
And on the basis of that, you can make up interpret makeup is the wrong word.

692
01:10:58,679 --> 01:11:11,879
You can be drawn into various worlds, various interpretations, because the boundless sea and the sperm whale with no face keeps open.

693
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:26,519
the bad things that can happen if you get a supreme being that settles once and for all what color everything is, or the kind of whiteness that comes if you think you can add up what color everything is, and you get whiteness.

694
01:11:26,519 --> 01:11:32,279
And so it's you've got to have the ocean, you've got to have the sperm whale, and then you can have the colors.

695
01:11:32,279 --> 01:11:34,439
That's the picture that Ichmeel has.

696
01:11:34,439 --> 01:11:34,919
Yeah.

697
01:11:37,239 --> 01:11:38,919
And what do you do with that?

698
01:11:42,599 --> 01:11:44,200
Don't ask me to think about it now.

699
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,319
We'll talk about it later.

700
01:11:45,319 --> 01:11:47,080
I see that it's there.

701
01:11:47,319 --> 01:11:48,599
I don't know what to do with it.

702
01:11:48,599 --> 01:11:53,719
I'll say, so now I just want to I'm still trying to finish what I really want to say about all this.

703
01:11:54,760 --> 01:12:04,439
So I think Melville isn't longing for the pantheon, the Homeric kind of world, but he would be very happy if it came back.

704
01:12:04,439 --> 01:12:06,200
But what do you do while you're waiting?

705
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:26,919
Well then, just to summarize, you visit all the worlds, not as a tourist and a spectator, not so involved that you go native, not by imposing your interpretation on them, but openness to be absorbed in any particular world's sacred understandings they've got.

706
01:12:27,639 --> 01:12:34,519
And the the squeeze of the hand is just an example of what it's like to be absorbed in a strange world.

707
01:12:35,479 --> 01:12:42,200
So, my conclusion then is that we definitely what is what is what is the Ishmael telling us then, or Melville?

708
01:12:42,399 --> 01:13:09,759
We have to bring, if you're going to live a meaningful life, and you happen to be one of the people who aren't convinced anymore by onto-theology and don't believe there's a supreme being, and if you are sophisticated enough not to anymore be in the modern autonomy con business either, then what you've got to do is there is the possibility.

709
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,080
Well, I listed all the things that it's not to sum up.

710
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:13,839
So, how should we act now?

711
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:20,959
That the Homeric gods are gone, the Aeschylus gods are gone, when these things are dead, they're dead for good.

712
01:13:21,359 --> 01:13:34,239
Their works of art don't work for us anymore, Virgil and Augustus don't work either, and neither does this unconditional commitment story of Father Mapple.

713
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:39,839
So, you get this proposal to take all these moods as divine gifts.

714
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,479
Now, I've got to quickly skim this, I'm just at the end.

715
01:13:42,479 --> 01:13:44,479
Time is just one more minute.

716
01:13:45,439 --> 01:13:53,999
So, you've got to, I'm just going to say it one more time as I wrote it here: give up onto theology, a life grounded in revelation, reason, or unconditional commitment.

717
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,999
Give up will and autonomy.

718
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,799
There's no way that we can posit things mattering for us and having meaning in our life.

719
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:14,479
You've got to be willing to accept risk and sorrow, Ishmael says, and then you've got to be grateful for whatever ontological moods, that is, worlds, that is, gods, grab you and have authority in your life.

720
01:14:14,479 --> 01:14:19,120
Then you will be open to relative meaning and relative happiness.

721
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:23,599
And I think you'll be saved or cured.

722
01:14:24,559 --> 01:14:28,359
That's an open question because Neilville doesn't talk more about it.

723
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:33,000
Now I want to say something that only Heideggerians will understand, but it fascinates me.

724
01:14:33,239 --> 01:14:41,080
Heidegger thought that there was a special kind, if you ask me, but is this a work of art, this?

725
01:14:41,399 --> 01:14:53,959
Well, it certainly doesn't have a culture built around it, and nobody's making altars to it like they did to the Divine Comedy or to the Aeneid, or they don't perform it every year or read it every year on the National Public Radio.

726
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:55,799
It's not that kind of work of art.

727
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:59,399
But Heidegger knew that there wasn't anymore that kind of work of art.

728
01:14:59,399 --> 01:15:06,200
But he thought that there was a German poet which he was very impressed by, Hilderland.

729
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:09,080
Is that how to spell it, I hope?

730
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:11,879
With an umlaut here.

731
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:12,839
Okay.

732
01:15:13,319 --> 01:15:18,599
And that this poet was what Heidegger called a poet in a needy time.

733
01:15:18,599 --> 01:15:22,679
And he was making a kind of work of art for a needy time.

734
01:15:22,679 --> 01:15:25,000
And what does Hölderland do?

735
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:31,559
He talks about the Greeks and the gods and the hope that there could be a return of the gods.

736
01:15:31,559 --> 01:15:34,919
And he keeps that possibility, so to speak, open.

737
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:38,279
That's all you can do in a needy time.

738
01:15:38,279 --> 01:15:46,359
You can't have a work of art as you could when there was still some kind of unity in the culture.

739
01:15:46,359 --> 01:15:51,479
And in a way, all I want to say only to myself in a way is, this is our Höderland.

740
01:15:51,479 --> 01:15:53,959
He is our poet in needy times.

741
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:57,319
And this is the only kind of work of art you can have now.

742
01:15:57,319 --> 01:16:00,040
And that makes it a work of art of sorts.

743
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:00,599
That's it.

744
01:16:00,599 --> 01:16:01,559
Sorry I talked too long.
