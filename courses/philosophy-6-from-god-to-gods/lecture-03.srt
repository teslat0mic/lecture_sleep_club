1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
And death the same way, and so forth.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,880
So that's the next level.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:29,199
Now, one of Cronus's children, no, sorry, not Cronus, who's who's the one who's having yeah, Cronus' children, are there three of them, Hera, which is a funny problem, which I'll mention later, not important, and the Cyclops, which is another funny problem, not very important, but we'll come back to them.

4
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:39,039
But Zeus, the head god, and the main epithet for Zeus is protector of strangers.

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,120
That should be a clue.

6
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,800
Strangers are people who come from other worlds, into your world.

7
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:55,679
And one of Zeus's jobs, it seems maybe his main job, it's the only thing, sometimes he's the wielder of the Thunderbolt, so forth.

8
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:06,559
But his main job seems to be to make sure that people from other worlds get treated with respect and helpful and so forth.

9
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:20,639
And everybody always says Zeus will be very angry at you if you violate, if you don't take good care of your guests, and very angry at you if you're a guest and you violate the special relation between them.

10
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,679
So, and now we have to jump to Athena at the top.

11
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:31,679
The interesting thing is, Athena is Zeus's favorite person.

12
00:01:31,999 --> 00:01:38,960
And what they have in common is that she is a cross-world person, too.

13
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,839
She doesn't protect strangers.

14
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,520
She's able to help Odysse go from world to world and get in sync with each.

15
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,040
But no wonder she's Zeus's favorite.

16
00:01:51,039 --> 00:02:12,440
That's another aspect of what you need and admire if you're a multi-world, if you have a multi-world culture and a multi-world understanding of being, you need somebody who protects the people going from culture to culture and helps them get in sync with each world they're in.

17
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:12,840
Yeah.

18
00:02:16,279 --> 00:02:17,080
I couldn't hear you.

19
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,160
Say it again.

20
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,999
Or is she also in trouble?

21
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:21,879
No, neither.

22
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:30,039
I mean, he asks, is she a goddess that helps you go from mood to mood or different moods in different worlds?

23
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:35,400
She's not a, she's the other member, she's the un she's the mood of cool persons.

24
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,879
She never gets in any particular mood.

25
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:48,200
She cools people like Odyssey and Helen off when they're losing their wits from passionate openness.

26
00:02:49,400 --> 00:03:02,039
And she does help Odysseus go from world to world, but not by getting into the right mood, but by getting in sync with all of them, each of them, in due course.

27
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,679
That is her job.

28
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:12,919
And that's why she's always there, helping him, except one place where he's totally outside of all the worlds.

29
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:20,440
And that's when he gets captured by the Cyclops, who's really a piece of nature, practically, a minimal world.

30
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:27,239
And then he's, interestingly enough, Athena can't help him, I think, and doesn't help him.

31
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:35,479
But in any kind of human, normal human world, she can help him get the feel for it.

32
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:41,080
And then, like James Bond, he is the best at all the things that people in that world do.

33
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:47,520
Their kind of games, connoisseur of their kind of food, and what else?

34
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:58,479
Anything, getting the names of all the people at the dinner party, in general, completely adaptable to whatever civilized world he's in.

35
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,039
Now, let's look at these others.

36
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,199
I jumped to Athena.

37
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,879
A really funny one is Hermes.

38
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,799
When I got Hermes figured out, then I thought I really understood something.

39
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:16,559
Hermes is the other favorite of Zeus, besides Athena.

40
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,960
Now, that is really weird.

41
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,799
We can see why Athena is his favorite.

42
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,159
She gets you in sync with each world.

43
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:23,679
What is Hermes up to?

44
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,080
His job is to be a thief.

45
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,560
He's a thief, and he's a person who leads people from world to world.

46
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,640
He leads the living to the dead.

47
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:39,279
He leads Odysseus away from Clyta, gets him away from Calypso and so forth.

48
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:46,560
And what's interesting is Hermes, I think, is, what does it mean to, why is it important that he's a thief?

49
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,760
He's a trickster, too.

50
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,719
I mean, you can see, again, there are things Odyssey likes.

51
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:58,480
Odyssey says when he gets home and finds that they've eaten all the cattle and depleted his stores, he'll go, he's a pirate.

52
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,119
He says, well, I'll go to other islands and I'll steal them.

53
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:01,920
I'll steal them.

54
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,279
He's a thief, too.

55
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,400
I don't know how to fit that into a mood story, but it's okay to be a thief.

56
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,320
But at an ontological level, what would it be to be a thief?

57
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:20,560
Well, it would be to take practices and ways of understanding things from one world and bring them over into another world.

58
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,640
And Hermes does that.

59
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,159
He does it when they're visiting Calypso.

60
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:31,799
He takes her world of drugs.

61
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:32,919
Is it Circe?

62
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,880
No, it's Circe.

63
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:40,840
He takes her world of drugs and uses it against her to cancel her drugs.

64
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,640
I mean, it's not a perfect example, and there may be others.

65
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:54,679
But I think Hermes is a very interesting something or other who is able to take things from one world and use them in another world.

66
00:05:54,999 --> 00:05:59,160
I mean, nowadays, that would be somebody who discovered, for instance, the telephone.

67
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,400
I see somebody with a phone, and it reminds me.

68
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,680
When Graham Bell invented the telephone, he thought it was only for businesses.

69
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,359
He thought, who in the world wants this thing ringing in their homes?

70
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:12,359
And it took a while for that to happen.

71
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:16,039
And then, of course, now everyone wants one ringing in their pocket, even.

72
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:33,800
And Hermes would be the kind of person who would be able to see that, to see that you could transplant the practice of businesses using phones to families using phones for utterly different reasons, not to bid on stocks and hire people, but to keep track of where the kids are and so forth.

73
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:40,199
So anyway, Hermes, I think, is a kind of very interesting, possible cross-world way of being.

74
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:46,999
Now, the other ones are pretty straightforward, but I want to just mention them anyway.

75
00:06:46,999 --> 00:07:06,999
Okay, so Aries, you don't hear all that much about Aries in here, but of course in the Iliad you do, those of you who know, because Aries is the god of ferocious war, of going completely berserk and killing hundreds of people in an afternoon when you're in the Aries, when Aries is shining on you.

76
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:14,599
Apollo, I've already said, is this kind of almost got theory already, because he's the lord of distance.

77
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:22,400
Hephaestus, you should know these things probably just to follow the book well, because all these gods coming and going.

78
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,119
Hephaestus is the craftsman.

79
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:27,439
He makes all the beautiful things.

80
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,999
And one of the wonderful things about these Homeric Greeks is they loved sort of craftsmen.

81
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:47,440
And, you know, Homer stops to comment on the tables, on the jugs, on the chairs, on the well-hung doors, on all the beautiful gold goblets and silver goblets and so forth.

82
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,400
And Hephaestus is the craftsman behind all that.

83
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,799
One of the funny things is, this is hard to figure out, and I may have to push things.

84
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:02,479
Hephaestus is married to Aphrodite, which is odd.

85
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:12,239
Hephaestus is lame and presumably a kind of rough character, he's a kind of blacksmith, among other things.

86
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:15,039
Why is he married to Aphrodite?

87
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:27,039
Well, the only thing I can think of is that you could have a culture in which the question is: how do you understand the erotic in your culture?

88
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:34,399
And if you understand it as, say, violent, I had some other example in mind, but I can't think of it now.

89
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,280
It doesn't matter.

90
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,760
There are all kinds of ways to understand the erotic.

91
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:43,120
But what I think the Greeks do is they understand the erotic tied up with the artificial.

92
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:47,280
That is, with beautiful clothes and beautiful jewelry.

93
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,640
The last thing we hear about Helen is that she in this her beautiful long robe.

94
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:55,360
She's lying next to Menelaus.

95
00:08:55,359 --> 00:09:10,840
So there is some kind of connection between making beautiful things and ornaments and so forth and the woman who is the most sexy of all in the world, golden Aphrodite.

96
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,719
So anyway, they are linked for the Greeks, and I think that's really quite fascinating.

97
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:19,000
I don't know what Prosophany does.

98
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:22,920
If anybody has a theory about it, they can come and tell me.

99
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,280
And Dionysus, for some reason I don't understand.

100
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,599
Homer hasn't, Homer's not interested in Dionysus.

101
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:34,520
He hasn't made it into the Homeric pantheon.

102
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:36,280
I don't know why.

103
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:39,719
And Hera is a funny one.

104
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,200
Hera should be the goddess of domesticity.

105
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,360
That is a different kind of emotion, mood, and so forth.

106
00:09:50,359 --> 00:09:52,520
But she isn't.

107
00:09:52,519 --> 00:10:03,320
And it's tied up with the fact that Homer sort of plays, has to have a problem because she's both the sister of Zeus and the wife of Zeus.

108
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,639
And I don't know if that's all very well in Egypt at that time.

109
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:10,760
Marks married their brothers and sisters.

110
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,920
But it's not all right, I think, for Homer.

111
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,679
And so he doesn't know quite what to do with Hera.

112
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:25,560
And Hera shows up mostly just being jealous of Zeus running off with other women, which is not very illuminating as far as I can see.

113
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,960
And the Cyclops is a funny case, too.

114
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,320
He turns out to be the minimal form of human life.

115
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:33,239
Now, let me see.

116
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,800
Oh, you can look at this while I look at my notes to see if I've told you what I want to tell you.

117
00:10:37,800 --> 00:11:03,359
So, finally, that in the fourth generation, that is, Cronus is the second, Zeus is the third, all these children of Zeus at the top, that's what I'm calling the fourth generation, those are the gods of the various Greek moods, the various Greek ways of life, the various worlds that you can get into.

118
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,120
As I put in that little box, they're the possible Greek worlds.

119
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:07,999
Now, let's see.

120
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:09,920
Ah, yeah, I have written something here.

121
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,120
Let's see.

122
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:17,680
Oh, yeah, it's the missing line about why is Hephaestus married to Aphrodite?

123
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,800
Well, different cultures interpret the erotic differently.

124
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,640
I said here, it could be thought of as aggressive, for instance.

125
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,400
It could be thought of as extremely receptive, for instance.

126
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:39,600
But to think of it as something that is a kind of can be made, is beautiful and could be made more beautiful, that seems to be the way Homer thinks about it.

127
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:48,400
Each of the gods of the different worlds get people in tune with different ways of acting, different situations by shining on them.

128
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:55,440
They make all these ways of life possible, in which they are the attuning ones, remember.

129
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:04,400
And the only thing to say finally is the person who's interested who makes all these attunings possible is Athena and Hermes.

130
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:13,360
That's why they're the favorite children of Zeus, because it's polytheism, but somehow it values the plurality of worlds.

131
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:18,240
So, Zeus and Athena and Hermes are the expression of that.

132
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,799
I think it's funny that people never talk about that, and maybe there's some other way of understanding it, but I don't see any other way.

133
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:31,560
The way Zeus, Protector of Strangers, links with Athena cross-world and Hermes.

134
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,359
Does anybody want to say anything?

135
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,440
The time is almost up, but we've got three minutes to get one reaction.

136
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,880
Yeah, Beatrice.

137
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,200
Also interesting that both Aphrodite and the final Really?

138
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:44,920
Huh.

139
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,719
Oh, yeah, she comes in from the ocean, doesn't she?

140
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:52,120
From the blood of castrated whoever, Kronos.

141
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,760
And Hephaestus, who's he?

142
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:56,119
I see.

143
00:12:56,119 --> 00:12:57,000
Well, that's interesting.

144
00:12:56,999 --> 00:12:59,639
I I'll just repeat it for those who didn't hear it.

145
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:10,280
It's interesting that the two puzzling ones that I'm making up interesting to hope interesting stories about, namely Hephaestus and Aphrodite, are neither one of them Zeus' children.

146
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,599
They and therefore they must have some special powers, but I don't know what it is.

147
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:15,960
We should think about it.

148
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,480
Okay, that's it.

149
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:22,599
We'll go back to again to on on Thursday.

150
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:26,279
Read read up to page two oh six for Thursday.
