1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,519
And today, we're reading the two things together, which make a great fun and sparks when you put them together.

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:24,799
Lattimore's explanation of what's happening in the Oristea, particularly in the Agamemnon, the first play, and Aeschylus, who actually wrote it and knows what's happening, telling you his story.

3
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:29,919
And how the question we're going to ask is, how well do they fit together?

4
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:34,559
Remember I said read Lattimore because you might find out that it's wrong.

5
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,279
It's no secret, as you'll see.

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,439
I think Latimore is dead wrong.

7
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,159
But you're free to think otherwise.

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,960
And if you do, you can write a paper defending him.

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,399
But and I don't want to settle it.

10
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,680
I want to look at it.

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,959
So now we have to start.

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:01:08,440
But before we can jump in and start reading the Clydemnestor speech in the in the Agamemnon, which this all turns, I just want to review because I had enough discussion in office hours to realize how hard this is.

13
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:14,199
This is a very, very hard play to read, and the concepts are very deep and original.

14
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:21,240
So I'm just going to review for the first, say, ten minutes of things I've already said that need to keep saying.

15
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:42,760
For one thing, the students who talked to me were confused about the right with a capital R and justice with a capital J, which get thrown around pretty much by everybody in the play, the Furies and Clytemnestra and Orestes, you'll see in the next play.

16
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:51,960
Remember that Aeschylus doesn't have a good vocabulary for sorting them out.

17
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,879
And moreover, in a certain sense, they're of right, every side thinks they're on the side of the right.

18
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:06,839
Naturally, the Furies think they're right, punishing people who did any damage to any members of your family.

19
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:14,279
And the Apollo Pantheon people think they're in the right, punishing anybody who breaks oaths and breaks the law.

20
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:17,720
And so they're all for right and justice.

21
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:19,399
You can't sort it out.

22
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,479
But it isn't just an accident or a confusion.

23
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,160
It's the problem.

24
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,919
They each think that their way of doing things is the right and the just way.

25
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,480
It's more confusing about vengeance and retribution.

26
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:55,119
I want to use those words to distinguish the kind of mafia culture where you constantly kill some member of the family whose member kills some member of your family through endless cycles of revenge.

27
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:58,479
That's the fury world, vengeance.

28
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:09,520
And I want to use retribution as a word for what happens in the law when you break the law and then you have just retribution.

29
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:18,639
That is, you get punished or executed or whatever it is that the law says has to happen to you if you broke the law.

30
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:29,360
Unfortunately, vengeance seems to be the only word that, whatever the Greek word is, it gets translated vengeance more or less at random.

31
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,840
I don't know if it ever gets translated retribution.

32
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:32,800
I don't think so.

33
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:43,760
So you have to see, by way of the context, and you'll see me doing it, when the Furies are talking about vengeance, they mean blood, feud, revenge.

34
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:51,360
When the Apollonian gods talk about vengeance, which they do less, then they mean retribution.

35
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,960
They mean people paying the legal penalty for what they did wrong.

36
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:13,759
And to put it in now, connecting up with what I said in the last lecture about the old gods and the new gods, so the old gods are for vengeance, revenge, and the new gods are for retribution, legal sanctions.

37
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:23,199
And now, I wanted to say just a word more about old gods and new gods, because I discovered I forgot to say something on 48 that might help a little.

38
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,319
You're solving this immense crossword puzzle.

39
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,759
That is keeping track of the names of everybody.

40
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:37,800
The Furies are also called the Arenaes, and by the last play, they're going to be called the Eumenides.

41
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,879
Those are all the same ladies.

42
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:49,080
And so I've gotten look on page 48, so you can see how to spell it, where at the bottom, where is it?

43
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:49,800
Ah.

44
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,999
I don't see it.

45
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,119
Hmm.

46
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:56,439
Try 49 at the top.

47
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:57,399
No?

48
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,440
The black furies at the bottom of 48.

49
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:02,119
Well, I'm going to write it on the board then.

50
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:04,119
I must have, I've got the wrong page.

51
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:06,279
But sometimes that's what they're called.

52
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:12,520
So we better, and you need to know it because Aeschylus isn't going to tell you, since the Greeks already know it.

53
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:22,039
So the Furies are also called Iranes, E-R-I-N-Y-E-S.

54
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,999
And they're going to be called at the very end of the book the Eumenides.

55
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:32,040
Okay, and Apollo, while I'm up here, is also called Luxius.

56
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,919
Where are you?

57
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:34,680
Apollo.

58
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,439
Oh, yeah, good idea.

59
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,759
Shall I write all this over again?

60
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:39,639
Yeah, you're right.

61
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,959
The combination of my writing is too small.

62
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,119
Why do I write it up here, too?

63
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:50,199
The Furies are called the Aranes, and they're called the Humanities.

64
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:59,079
Not until the end of the, not until the last play, but very important, that's they change their identity when they get the new name.

65
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:02,759
And Apollo is also called Luxius.

66
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:08,839
So now, the Bob, I don't know anything about the name Iranes.

67
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,759
That's why they're called that.

68
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,079
I think they're called Humenides, is related, I'm pretty sure, to the Humanities.

69
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:18,480
For reasons you'll see at the end of the play.

70
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,959
And Luxius is interesting.

71
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:31,519
I used to think, just I don't know why, just because it's easy to think it, that Apollo is the sun god and he's the light god and looks, LUX means light.

72
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,280
So that's what Luxius means.

73
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,480
But that isn't right.

74
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,399
Luxius is related to logic, which is nice.

75
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:53,759
And so out of the Luxius comes logos in Greek, and logos is the word that gets translated sometimes logic, sometimes argument.

76
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:56,960
But they're all very fitting for Apollo.

77
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:08,400
Apollo, I thought of another thing, besides being an enlightenment fanatic, believing in universal rationality without any need for feelings and without any partial understanding.

78
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,879
You just have to see the whole truth.

79
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,880
He's also a kind of debater, as you'll see in the last play.

80
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:27,600
Those of you who were, and I know some of you were, on your debate team, Apollo wants to actually have this argued out in public, and he wants somebody to decide who wins.

81
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,079
He's really simply, I mean, that's the kind of logic he's got.

82
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:35,360
And if you were on the debate team, you understand that.

83
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,120
And so the old gods, to sum up what we said last time, are personal gods.

84
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,000
They are feeling, not thinking.

85
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:45,439
They don't believe in debate.

86
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:51,680
At one point, they say to Athena, don't try to dock my position by argument.

87
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,399
That is, don't try to use arguments to take away their power.

88
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,080
They don't care about arguments.

89
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,240
And they're the powers of darkness in the depths of the earth.

90
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:02,599
They belong to a particular locale.

91
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:08,680
They belong to a particular family and to a particular person whom they protect and avenge.

92
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,520
And that leads to a sort of funny question, which you have to ask yourself at some point.

93
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:25,640
Well, are there different furies all around already for every person who might be killed and whose blood would then need to be avenged so that your furies and my furies are sitting somewhere in a stockpile of furies?

94
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,479
Surely that's not right.

95
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:30,920
There seems to be something like a pool of furies.

96
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:41,879
And then when any bad thing happens, certain furies from among that pool get assigned to going after the person who killed somebody.

97
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,040
So in this case, Orestes is going to kill Agamemnon.

98
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,959
No, I'm sure it's not a secret.

99
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:50,120
I hope it doesn't come as a surprise to you.

100
00:08:50,439 --> 00:08:51,079
It's okay.

101
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:51,639
Either way.

102
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:57,800
Anyway, Orestes is going to kill Agamemnon, and then Agamemnon's furies are going to come after him.

103
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:05,719
And already, he's got Clytemnestra's furies coming after him for having killed her daughter, blood relative.

104
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,000
And now he's got to pay the price.

105
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:17,800
So I picture it, if it's any help, like at an airport, a whole pool of taxis, and then each person goes out and calls a taxi, which gets assigned to them.

106
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:31,719
So each person calls on a fury, and then that becomes their fury, and it protects them, and it forces them, or sort of urges them to commit the crime, the next stage.

107
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:39,160
Now, they don't think of it as a crime, the vengeance of the next stage to revenge the previous murder.

108
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:48,959
So, and the furies are partial, and they're strongly biased, and they're primitive and ultimately they come from blood.

109
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:56,720
Remember, I say they they came from the blood of castrated Uranus and they are protectors of blood relatives.

110
00:09:56,719 --> 00:10:12,479
And the new gods who aren't all male, but who are represented by Apollo, and he is very male and doesn't have any sense of feeling or kindness or gentleness or family or anything.

111
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,400
He just wants to win his debates.

112
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:20,640
He's thinking rational, impartial, impartial, and he wants to be out in the light.

113
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:27,040
And he's just as they're in the earth, Apollo's in the sky.

114
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:37,920
The new gods reign on high, from on high, and they reign over the entire world, and they're the gods of civilization and universal justice.

115
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:49,520
And then there are also the furies that reign from below of the earth, and they're the gods of local family allegiance or ties.

116
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,319
And the new gods are worshipped in open places.

117
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,760
I didn't say that, I don't think.

118
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,800
They're called at some point the gods of the marketplace.

119
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,480
It doesn't mean that they protect the people who sell vegetables.

120
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:17,600
They mean that the big marketplace, Agora, where the Athenian Greeks met to do their politics and talk to each other and so forth, to be the god of that marketplace, which did apparently sell vegetables around the edges.

121
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:27,040
I was just checking it out today, except on days of big political conventions when it was all full of Athenians who had a vote because they had a direct democracy.

122
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,640
So every citizen could vote on every issue.

123
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,479
But anyway, all of this discussion was out in the open.

124
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:36,520
That's what it is to be a god of the marketplace.

125
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:43,880
Whereas the Furies are operating sort of deviously and in the dark and during the night, so forth.

126
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:55,800
And the new gods govern institutional relations, the relations between kings and subjects, between citizens, and between husbands and wives.

127
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,559
Marriage is an institution.

128
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:00,280
All of these are social conventions.

129
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,760
And the new gods are in charge of social conventions.

130
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:20,360
And the old gods are in charge of these sort of private matters, which get settled mostly at home where nobody's around, not out in the public, but in the private at night, and so forth.

131
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:25,960
And then comes, and now we're back to this, two kinds of justice.

132
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:34,440
There's the Fury justice, which is emotional, personal, local, blood kind of justice.

133
00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:43,159
And then there's the other gods, the new gods kind of justice, which is public, open, rational, universal law codes.

134
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:44,040
Let me read that again.

135
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,360
I was proud of that list.

136
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,840
So I'll read it slower this time.

137
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:49,640
Bigger.

138
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:55,640
The okay, so there's you can decide which you better know which column without my telling you.

139
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:06,840
There's the each well some who's on the side of the emotional, personal, local, blood feud kind of justice.

140
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:10,040
The furies, I just want to make sure you're with it.

141
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:21,840
And on and now, and so we know who's on the other side, the new gods, they're on the side of public, out in the open, rational, universal, impersonal law.

142
00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:23,680
That's a standoff.

143
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:36,720
Everything that anyone does in the Agamemnon that's important is that they do it for either one or the other of these forces.

144
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,040
Dave, I have the eerie feeling just a second that we didn't turn this on, did we?

145
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,599
Do I got a green light or a red light?

146
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,200
Okay, good.

147
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:47,199
Job of turning all these things on.

148
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,559
It's pretty weird.

149
00:13:48,559 --> 00:14:03,280
Okay, so and the tragic situation is, and this is just finishing summing up, each side claims it's the only side, the right side, the true justice side, and so you're halfway to monotheism.

150
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:16,559
Each one of them wants to be the mono-god, and that since there are two sides, and that they can't be, neither can get along without the other, and neither can accept the other, and that's a mess.

151
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:20,559
That's the tragic situation at the beginning of the Orestea.

152
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:37,839
And Aeschylus is going to try to explain to the Athenians who are watching this play and who don't have this problem anymore how they got out of this problem and how important it is that they have gotten out of it and how special that makes the Athenians.

153
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:40,000
But that's only in the last play.

154
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:41,680
Okay, that's a summary.

155
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,040
I don't think I said anything, didn't think I was saying anything new.

156
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,120
Maybe, hopefully, maybe clearer.

157
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,440
So, yeah, are there any questions about that?

158
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:56,399
I'm sort of trying to answer all the possible confusions that I felt that you reasonably got into.

159
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,520
This is, as I say, very hard, very confusing.

160
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,439
And the fact that the translator doesn't do it right all the time doesn't help.

161
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:14,600
But when you find anything that contradicts what I say as you read it carefully, then come either come to office hours or just raise your hand, because then we have to look at the translation.

162
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:21,480
I've got now in the Greek with the clearest, literalest translation, and see what happens.

163
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:25,240
Usually, it turns out that it's a mistranslation.

164
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:34,360
I'll show you a whopping mistranslation by the end of today, which turns the whole thing absolutely inside out, gets it all wrong.

165
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:34,839
Okay.

166
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:41,479
If there are no questions and you haven't found any place that contradicts what I've been saying, we're going on.

167
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,520
Yeah.

168
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:43,639
That's right.

169
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,359
That's right.

170
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:47,479
Let me look at my copy on 36.

171
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:54,120
As I teach this over and over, I write in bit by bit the corrections.

172
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,640
Where's the night card?

173
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,479
The very top.

174
00:15:58,439 --> 00:15:59,639
36 or 46?

175
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,040
46.

176
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:00,840
46.

177
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:02,520
I'm on the wrong page.

178
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,319
Okay.

179
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:06,599
Zeus, Lord and Night above.

180
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:12,520
And then I write in the margin, see page 48, bottom.

181
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:16,279
I don't know whether that's going to cast any light on this, but let's see.

182
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,520
Well, no, that's what you expect.

183
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:23,400
The black furies in the dark and so forth.

184
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,560
Why should Zeus be in the dark?

185
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,920
I don't like it.

186
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,759
Let's take a look right away.

187
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:31,799
That's too strange.

188
00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:35,959
So I am looking at, I've lost it.

189
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:37,479
Where was it again?

190
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:38,279
Okay.

191
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,480
Uh w what what line do we want?

192
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:42,999
Line 355.

193
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,480
So far, everything has always come out all right.

194
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:49,279
Someday I'm just going to run crash into something that just doesn't come out right.

195
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:50,400
Then I don't know what I'm going to do.

196
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,759
Hail Zeus and thou kingly knight.

197
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,239
Well that makes a big difference already, doesn't it?

198
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,480
If maybe there's maybe it's Zeus and the Furies.

199
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:05,840
Let's see if that could work.

200
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,279
Let me just go on, that hast given us great glory for our possession.

201
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:18,160
Now let's cast thy left snare upon the towered walls of Troy, so that old nor young could or leap doesn't throng.

202
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,880
Great Zeus it is, Lord of host and guest.

203
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,079
No, I don't think that my move, that move doesn't work so well.

204
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,680
Oh, Zeus, our Lord and Knight beloved.

205
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:28,800
Look again.

206
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,640
But it does make a difference whether you put a comma.

207
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,479
See, they put a comma in this.

208
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,439
Hail Sovereign Zeus, comma, and thou kindly knight.

209
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:38,560
That helps.

210
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:42,239
But I don't know if that helps enough.

211
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:44,959
Best I can do for the moment.

212
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,999
It's a little better.

213
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:47,120
The comma helps.

214
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,719
Because we don't want Zeus to turn out to be knight.

215
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:52,640
That just can't be right.

216
00:17:53,279 --> 00:18:00,880
And if you think that, but if you think that they could be saying, well, this reminds me of an issue we can discuss right now.

217
00:18:01,199 --> 00:18:05,920
And then, in fact, it's very important that you should bring this particular passage up.

218
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,079
It's related to what we were talking about earlier.

219
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:17,680
Somebody asked in office hours a question which is like sort of so simple, so obvious, I couldn't imagine why I hadn't ever asked myself that question.

220
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,519
So, who is in charge of beating up on the Trojans?

221
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,279
Have they done something that infuriates the Furies?

222
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,680
Have they done something that offends the high gods?

223
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,479
Or have they done, and in addition, or also or whatever?

224
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,959
And what's the role of Zeus in all that?

225
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:50,359
Well, it starts to be clear, once you ask the question, right at the beginning on 36, as if Agamemnon wants to get this question sort of off his plate because he's got other things to worry about, namely Athens.

226
00:18:50,360 --> 00:19:00,359
And he's not really interested in the Trojan War, except that it comes down to him as a tradition that he's using to write his play.

227
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:08,920
So it's interesting that starting the whole speech, it's obvious about Troy, ten years since the great contestants of Prime's right.

228
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,359
So it's Troy.

229
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,799
And now you get down about six lines from the bottom.

230
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:18,119
Someone hears in the air a god, Apollo, or Pan.

231
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:21,079
I said I didn't know what that is, or why that's in there.

232
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:28,839
And you discover a little, and that drives late on its mark the fury upon the transgressors.

233
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:40,519
And then it says, and so drives Zeus, the great guest god, the Tridi against Alexander, the Greeks against Trojans, for one woman and so forth.

234
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,199
But what does that say?

235
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:44,920
That says an amazing mouthful.

236
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:58,599
It says the Trojans have done something that upsets Apollo and that upsets the Furies, and upsets Zeus as the great guest, as the god of guests, and upsets Zeus as the one behind it all.

237
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:05,079
Everybody's upset about Troy and the way Aeschylus sees it.

238
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:10,359
And now you have to ask yourself the further question: well, what did Troy do that was so wrong?

239
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:16,239
Well, it all is tied up, of course, with Paris, with Alexander, with the fact that they took Paris in.

240
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,160
And I think, will you guys all keep your eyes open for something?

241
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:23,120
I don't have time to reread the whole play every time a new question comes up.

242
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:24,400
Maybe you know.

243
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,799
Did Paris marry Helen?

244
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:28,560
I think so.

245
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,640
You think, I see lots of nods, no.

246
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,880
I have no evidence to back me up.

247
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:35,999
But keep your eyes open about it.

248
00:20:35,999 --> 00:20:44,479
But even if not, I think, well, I think he better have married Helen.

249
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:48,239
But because I think I can't picture it otherwise.

250
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:52,959
Because where is that passage about the bridal thing that we were reading earlier?

251
00:20:53,199 --> 00:20:54,880
King England and I were discussing this.

252
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:05,999
Okay, it sounds like we're supposed to just know that they could get married because they don't recognize marriage in another country with other laws.

253
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:08,959
There's no treaties between Troy and Argos.

254
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:10,400
They've got nothing to do with each other.

255
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,400
So they don't care whether Helen's already married to Agamemnon.

256
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,040
And there is this talk on 60 what?

257
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,999
Okay, 56 and 57.

258
00:21:21,199 --> 00:21:22,880
Oh yeah, Helen.

259
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:31,840
And then there's something about on line 690, appropriately death of ships, men, cities from the bower, soft curtains of cuta.

260
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,279
No, no, I wonder where it says the bridal stuff.

261
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:38,559
Ah, 705.

262
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,160
Oh yeah, the vengeance wrought on those men.

263
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,199
Yeah, you see this?

264
00:21:43,199 --> 00:21:49,759
Who graced in too loud voice the bride song, fallen to their lot to sing.

265
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:51,199
That's the Trojans.

266
00:21:51,199 --> 00:22:04,680
They were happy that they got a chance to be singing at the fact that Paris was marrying this beautiful, wonderful ex-queen, and that's outrageous.

267
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,400
Where is it now?

268
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,719
Well, thank goodness we found it.

269
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:08,680
Okay, here it is.

270
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:11,959
So when on, this is how you have to read this.

271
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:22,199
When you see Apollo back on page 36, you should write in the margin 56, because that's where you find out why Apollo is upset.

272
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:30,039
And on 56, you should write 36, because that's where you find out that Apollo was upset.

273
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:32,439
And I've written also in the margin 46.

274
00:22:32,439 --> 00:22:34,920
Now, I don't know what that is, so let's see.

275
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:47,640
Okay, no, that's, but that's it's open to 47 is good, because in 47, we see clearly why Zeus is against it.

276
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,920
He shamed the guests' right of the board chairs, right, about 400.

277
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,800
But that's obvious.

278
00:22:53,799 --> 00:23:02,599
I mean, so now we know Apollo is against it because the institution of marriage has been defiled, so to speak.

279
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:08,519
He's married twice, and everybody, and nobody, and the Trojans don't care a bit, they're celebrating.

280
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:23,160
So there goes Apollo, I mean, Zeus to, no, sorry, Apollo to smash them for breaking the law and not taking marriage oath seriously.

281
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:28,920
And then the question is: and the fury, why does the fury come and attack them?

282
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:34,759
Well, I guess it's because marriage has this double aspect.

283
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:42,359
I mean, on the one hand, it's sort of instinctual, sexual, and intimate kind of relationship.

284
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:47,199
And Paris has broken that by running off with Helen and sleeping with her.

285
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:58,480
That takes place all outside of law and institutions, and it infuriates them, the Furies, because it's an emotional thing, I guess.

286
00:23:58,719 --> 00:24:03,039
I'm trying to figure this out, and if I'm getting it wrong and you have a better story, I'd love to hear it.

287
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,080
So the Furies are upset because he's run off with Helen.

288
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,599
That's on an animal, instinctual, sexual level.

289
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:22,719
Apollo is upset because Helen was married to Agamemnon, and now Paris has the gull to marry her again, as if she weren't.

290
00:24:22,719 --> 00:24:39,839
And Zeus is upset because Paris was the guest of Agamemnon when he did it, and therefore violating what you should do when you're a guest, and you shouldn't do bad things to the host.

291
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,479
And then I think Zeus is also there because he's behind it all.

292
00:24:45,439 --> 00:24:50,640
That's, I think, when it says someone here is in the air, a god, Apollo, Pan, or Zeus.

293
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,479
I think Apollo is the institution-breaking part.

294
00:24:54,479 --> 00:24:57,999
Zeus might be the everything part.

295
00:24:57,999 --> 00:24:59,039
Maybe not.

296
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,320
Maybe, in fact, that causes, yeah, I don't know.

297
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:10,959
You can't tell in that line whether Zeus is in his job of being behind everything or Zeus is in his job as being one of the Pantheon, one of the Apollonians.

298
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:12,400
But then it doesn't matter.

299
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,080
So don't worry about it.

300
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,559
Yeah.

301
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:25,519
Wait, he hurt Agamemnon's household by stealing Helen away?

302
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:26,799
Yeah, okay.

303
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,640
I see.

304
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,840
Yes, I think it's something like the intimate thing, the family.

305
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,680
I mean, a family has a double thing.

306
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,840
A family, you can have a family without being married.

307
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:38,040
It's not an institutional thing.

308
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:46,999
It's an animal instinctual thing, having a mate and having offspring.

309
00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:49,479
And that's, Paris certainly offended that.

310
00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:54,519
He took her right out of that family situation.

311
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:55,160
Yes.

312
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,439
And then a marriage is also a legal thing.

313
00:25:58,439 --> 00:26:01,160
You swear an oath, it's an institution.

314
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:09,080
And he broke that too by not only dragging her away, but marrying her when she was already married.

315
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:17,879
So I think that's those are all the reasons why the Trojans get smashed from the gods' point of view.

316
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:25,559
All of the gods want to smash the Trojans because they took in Paris and protected him while he did these bad things.

317
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,680
And they celebrated it.

318
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,519
They thought the wedding was terrific.

319
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:29,319
And okay.

320
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:40,360
And I just want to keep repeating, it doesn't matter because Aeschylus just isn't interested in the Trojan War, and he's not going to tell you much more about it, why these gods were involved in it.

321
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,640
He's got his own problems as an Athenian.

322
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,040
Yeah.

323
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,559
Wait, I can't hear you, and I doubt if I can hit you by the microphone.

324
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,080
You're going to have to yell.

325
00:26:51,560 --> 00:27:14,360
I think, yes, I think that's what she's asking, but is Aeschylus ignoring the fact, and it's got to do with the apples, I take it, that there was a promise to Aphrodite that she, or Aphrodite promised to give Paris the most beautiful woman in the world because Paris had given Aphrodite the apple, making as the most beautiful goddess, right?

326
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,880
That was the deal.

327
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,719
I think that Aeschylus doesn't mention it at all.

328
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,359
I hope.

329
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,040
But you're suggesting, does he mention it?

330
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:22,640
You're not saying you know where he mentions it.

331
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:26,880
I think he doesn't mention it because it doesn't fit his story.

332
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:42,959
It isn't, it just would bring in a whole other dimension of sort of the myth that doesn't go with the issue of vengeance or of retribution or of guests, and those are the only things he cares about.

333
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:46,959
But I think it's very important to be clear about what is left out.

334
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:53,759
And if you discover that there is even an oblique allusion to the story about the apple, then somebody should got to come and let me know.

335
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:55,360
And I have to change my mind.

336
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,479
You want to say something?

337
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,400
You look like you want to say something.

338
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:58,720
No?

339
00:27:58,719 --> 00:27:59,199
Oh, okay.

340
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:00,320
No, you don't.

341
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:00,719
Okay.

342
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:02,239
Anybody want to say something?

343
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,799
Then we go on, because there's lots of interesting things still to happen.

344
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,479
Let's see.

345
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:09,680
I'm about.

346
00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:10,720
Yes, good.

347
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:11,760
That was a stopping point.

348
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:16,079
And now onward to humanist tragedy.

349
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:40,959
And remember in the way this course is fed up by my sort of Heideggerian ideas, that there are these humanists who are reading these great works and who have these sort of views of tradition that's getting better and better, but it's all the same tradition, and we're just getting clearer and clearer about ourselves as free psychological agents with character and responsibility.

350
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:48,320
And the humanists have a view about tragedy, of course, and it's the view you all had in high school.

351
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,199
Did all of you read some Greek tragedy?

352
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:53,439
How many read some Greek tragedy?

353
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:55,360
Practically everybody.

354
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,239
And lots of you read Oedipus.

355
00:28:58,239 --> 00:29:00,079
I mean, I remember, but I forgot how many.

356
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,039
How many read Oedipus?

357
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,079
It was the, oh, yeah, same people.

358
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,199
And did you read Aristotle?

359
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:06,519
How many read Aristotle on tragedy?

360
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:08,519
Oh, but you heard about Aristotle on tragedy.

361
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,119
Even if you didn't know you heard about it, that's what your teacher was telling you.

362
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:23,160
Because what happened is that Sophocles wrote a tragedy, namely the main one, and we're going to talk about Oedipus.

363
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,119
And Aristotle wrote a review.

364
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:38,680
And Aristotle wrote for the Athenians, who had seen Sophocles' Oedipus, what he thought the essential features of a tragedy were.

365
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,959
And that became the rule from then on.

366
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:51,719
So you presumably learned from Aristotle that there's a tragic hero and he demonstrates some kind of pride.

367
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:53,800
Hubris is the Greek word.

368
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:56,599
You probably learned that too, but you don't need to know.

369
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,400
And he makes some kind of fatal mistake.

370
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,320
The Greek is homatia.

371
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,799
And then he suffers for that.

372
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:10,119
And that suffering is a kind of catharsis that purifies him for his big mistake.

373
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,959
And out of that, the hero, the audience, learns something.

374
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:16,759
They learn to see things differently.

375
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:21,880
And that story works perfectly well for Sophocles.

376
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,320
The question is: does it work for Aespelus?

377
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,360
But let's go back.

378
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:36,759
It works for Sophocles, and it works for modern tragedy like Shakespeare, where people looked for psychology.

379
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,880
They want to know sort of what the personal motives were.

380
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:48,800
They want to know what was the bad thing that the people, the heroes did, and the protagonists did, and how they suffered and what they learned.

381
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:55,759
So Macbeth's kind of pride is ambition, and Macbeth suffers and learns about that.

382
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:02,880
Lear was pride was being possessive about Cordelia, and he learns and suffers for that.

383
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:10,719
The people suffer, so something wrong in their character, Aristotle says, and that's probably what you learned too.

384
00:31:10,719 --> 00:31:23,839
So it was being prideful that Oedipus was and rash and too sure of himself that led Oedipus to kill his father and for which he was punished.

385
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,359
But he was punished because he was hot-tempered.

386
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,839
That was his form of pride, impatient.

387
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,999
Anyway, the whole point, you get, that's your whole, you've heard that.

388
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,319
That is the humanist view of tragedy.

389
00:31:38,320 --> 00:32:00,880
And it sees it as getting clearer and better from Sophocles right on through Shakespeare up to contemporary people like Arthur Miller, who was still writing some kind of tragedy, or who wrote The Iceman Thomas and Eugene O'Neill, who wrote kind of the inner psychoanalytical tragedies.

390
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:11,119
And now the question is, is this one of those kind of humanist Aristotle analyzed tragedies?

391
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:19,600
And the interesting thing to begin with, you won't see how interesting until later, is that Latimer knows that it isn't.

392
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,320
So Latimer sounds like he agrees with me.

393
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:38,839
I want to say the whole humanist story is a psychological story about individuals and their characters and their bad character and their pride and the bad things they freely and responsibly do and the punishments that happen to them and how they learn to be better people for all that suffering.

394
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,920
That's all psychological.

395
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:49,640
And Aeschylus, at least our temporary opinion ought to be, Aeschylus doesn't care about individual psychological stuff.

396
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,959
He's caring about these gods, and these gods are cultural forces.

397
00:32:53,959 --> 00:33:06,759
The forces of feeling and revenge, which makes everybody do this cycle of killing, and the forces of order and logic that tries to stop the cycle of killing.

398
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:09,239
Individuals don't matter much.

399
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:12,440
I'll qualify that later, but for the time being.

400
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,080
And what Latimer says on page 24 is very important.

401
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:22,360
He says, but the direction, this is the bottom paragraph.

402
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:25,719
He says in Aeschylus, the past dominates the present action.

403
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:27,160
That's not important.

404
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:36,040
But what's important is, he says, but the direction in which he, that is, Aeschylus, steered tragedy was not generally followed.

405
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:40,120
The way he steered tragedy wasn't to make the past important.

406
00:33:40,199 --> 00:33:41,319
Past is always important.

407
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:53,560
Oedipus' past is important too, that he was, there was a prediction that he was going to kill his father and that they tried to kill him and put him out on the mountain and so forth.

408
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,680
There's a distanter past in Aeschylus, all right?

409
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:02,680
The whole family story of the Theestes brothers, and the Atreus kids.

410
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:07,959
But the main point is simply that it's not a psychological tragedy.

411
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,719
And this is what Vlatimer sees.

412
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:21,759
He says, Sophoclean drama prevailed since Euripides, under protest, framed tragedy in accordance with Sophocles, not Aeschylus.

413
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,199
Now, what does that mean?

414
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,920
Sophocles turned tragedy inward.

415
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:27,680
That's psychological.

416
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,120
That's the private.

417
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,120
That's the character story.

418
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:37,920
Sophocles turned tragedy inward upon the principal actors, and drama became the drama of character.

419
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:57,119
So we now, it looks like Latimer understands that Aeschylus wanted to do ontological or cultural drama, but that Sophocles, with his Oedipus-type tragedies, did a different kind of tragedy, and he won out.

420
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:01,920
The only play of Aeschylus that was continually performed was this one.

421
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:08,320
And that's because, as you'll see at the end, it's the most beautiful thing you could imagine for the Athenians.

422
00:35:08,319 --> 00:35:15,680
But anyway, now we have to go back and see whether Latimer sticks to what he said.

423
00:35:16,399 --> 00:35:18,639
Now we have to set the stage, so to speak.

424
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:24,799
For the most, I guess there are two absolutely fascinating speeches in the book, and we're about to read one.

425
00:35:24,799 --> 00:35:28,320
And for the libation bearers, next time you get to read the other.

426
00:35:28,319 --> 00:35:29,039
Okay, yeah.

427
00:35:33,919 --> 00:35:37,999
Well, no, Latimer thinks that both of them are tragedies.

428
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,759
They're just different kinds of tragedies.

429
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:44,640
He thinks Aeschylus has a tragedy in which fate, he isn't very clear about it.

430
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,479
And that's what you're really telling me.

431
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:53,439
He doesn't say what what's essential about Aeschylus' tragedy, 'cause he doesn't understand it, 'cause he doesn't see that it's ontological.

432
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,080
But he sees that the fate goes way back.

433
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:04,119
And he sees that the fate in a in Oedipus goes back to, but it's really the character of Oedipus that's that's crucial, not the fate.

434
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,039
He loses his temper at the crossroads.

435
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:08,919
That he had a you know, let's go l let's not go into it.

436
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:21,160
If you studied it, you know that there's this complicated combination in Sophocles of what Oedipus chose wrong and the way fate was setting him up so that he's almost sure to make, in fact sure to make the wrong choice.

437
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,359
Don't worry about it.

438
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:30,120
Just just watch what happens here, where the important thing is to see what or not what an ontological tragedy looks like.

439
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:36,680
And because up to now I've been saying psychological and ontological and I have a feeling you don't really fully understand it.

440
00:36:36,919 --> 00:36:37,559
Why should you?

441
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,560
It's sort of Heidegger jargon.

442
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:48,120
But I think once you see what happens in this speech, you will see clearly what what the difference is.

443
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,799
And now what speech?

444
00:36:49,799 --> 00:36:56,120
Well, when Agamemnon returns home, Clytemnestra makes a welcoming speech.

445
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,719
And it's a very, very interesting speech.

446
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:01,560
It's a brilliant speech.

447
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:20,680
What she's done, what she heard, what she has to do is convince the people that Agamemnon is a monster, a very, very bad person whom they've got to kill as soon as possible or he will make life miserable for everybody in Argos.

448
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:32,280
The reason she's got that job of having to do that is because she's married Augustus and they've taken over the castle and there's no place for Agamemnon and they intend to kill him.

449
00:37:32,279 --> 00:37:35,080
And they and they are and she's setting it up.

450
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:46,879
She wants to put a spin on his welcome that will make it okay for what they're about to do when they put him, when he's taking his bath, they put a net over him and then they stab him.

451
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:48,320
She stabs him.

452
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,560
So let's see where we are.

453
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:57,759
Okay, so it's all as if, I mean, the very best speechwriters in Washington have been at work on it.

454
00:37:57,759 --> 00:38:02,959
So the first thing she does is she tells them how upset they are.

455
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,039
The chorus are the people of Argos.

456
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,360
They've got to be convinced.

457
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:12,800
Otherwise, if they kill Agamemnon, the people are going to revolt and kill them.

458
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:23,039
But if they kill Agamemnon and show that they did the right thing and they saved the people from this bad guy, then the people are going to be all the more grateful to Clytemnestra and Aegisthus.

459
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:34,079
So the first thing she does is remind them of how upset they are that Agamemnon went to war and all their young men were killed, or many of them.

460
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,959
This is what she starts on page 45.

461
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:46,479
I will skip down, say, yet though the host come home, there's 345 in the margin, page 45.

462
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:50,640
Even so, the anger of these slaughtered men may never sleep.

463
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,880
These slaughtered men are the young men killed in the war.

464
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:57,919
Oh, let there be no fresh warning villainy.

465
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:02,560
So are the thoughts you hear from me, a woman merely, and so forth.

466
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,080
And the chorus thinks that, boy, is she really good.

467
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,120
She's given a good speech.

468
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:11,120
They say, my lady, no brave man could speak with better grace.

469
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:26,560
And then she goes on, and having gotten them all worried about their loss and so forth, the next thing she does is say, and see you, you're all the gold star mothers.

470
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,999
You've all lost your children.

471
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,799
That's terrible.

472
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:35,239
But then she says, but I really suffer with you because I lost my child.

473
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:38,760
So then she says, she sort of lines herself up on their side.

474
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:47,480
She's going to tell them, she's already sort of implied that she's.

475
00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:48,919
Where does she imply it?

476
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,360
She's also, I don't know.

477
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:59,800
I see that I've got something in my story which is a little far-fetched, but I'm going to do it anyway.

478
00:39:59,799 --> 00:40:09,320
I mean, she doesn't really line herself up with the suffering mothers until page 81 in a different speech.

479
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:11,399
So I'm making this up, but I like it.

480
00:40:11,399 --> 00:40:12,680
So I'm going to say it anyway.

481
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:21,640
Well, her second, if I were writing her speech, her second thing is to say, well, you mothers have all suffered, and you fathers too, but I'm with you.

482
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,839
I suffered equally.

483
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:27,640
She says it finally on 81 when she's justifying the murder instead of setting it up.

484
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,999
But it's the same speech.

485
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:31,239
This is just the other half of the speech.

486
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:35,879
On the middle of 41, she says, Yet look upon this dead man.

487
00:40:35,879 --> 00:40:46,360
You would not cross him once, when with no thought more than if a beast had died, when he ranged pastures swarmed with flocks, he slaughtered like a victim his own child.

488
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:53,239
And then she says, My child, my pain grown into love to charm the winds of Thrace and so forth.

489
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:58,919
And that's, and so her fury is justified.

490
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:03,959
She is justified in killing him and being furious at him because he killed her daughter.

491
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:13,479
And they're all justified in celebrating killing him because he killed their children and their fury's children that will get after all of them.

492
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,879
So, this is an entry at the bottom of 81.

493
00:41:15,879 --> 00:41:18,160
Great, your design, and so forth.

494
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:23,519
Swung to the red, drives the fury within your brain, and she's back talking about the Furies.

495
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,639
So, but this is only the beginning, this is just the setup.

496
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,920
So, she says, my daughter was sacrificed to.

497
00:41:31,919 --> 00:41:34,160
Now we're back on page 41.

498
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:41,039
She's telling them a story about how, in such a shocking way, he killed the daughter.

499
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:46,640
This is when we're going to get to Latimer, but you better just look first.

500
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,840
Remember how he killed the daughter.

501
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,879
Just remember that he was stuck, remember?

502
00:41:52,879 --> 00:41:56,719
He couldn't kill her and he couldn't not kill her.

503
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:03,199
If he killed her, he was going against his love as a father.

504
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:06,960
If he didn't kill her, he was going against his duty as a king.

505
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,920
There was nothing that he could do right, and he knew it.

506
00:42:09,919 --> 00:42:15,120
And he said in the middle of the page, a little below the middle, may all be well yet, but it wasn't.

507
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,560
It was necessary, and he sacrificed his daughter.

508
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,719
He did one bad thing.

509
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:22,719
Sacrificing his daughter wasn't a bad thing.

510
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:24,880
I mean, it was equally bad if he hadn't.

511
00:42:24,879 --> 00:42:27,040
I mean, or there were just two bad things.

512
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,960
But he did do this thing I mentioned on line 235.

513
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:37,040
He put a gag on her so that she couldn't curse the house of Atriot.

514
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,520
But that doesn't matter, turns out.

515
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,920
I said this already, because Clytemnestra curses him.

516
00:42:43,919 --> 00:42:52,400
Instead, I mean, it's the same fury curse whether uh Phagania does it or whether Phytimestri does it.

517
00:42:52,399 --> 00:42:58,719
So he's claiming that he killed the daughter and he killed the daughter in a shocking way.

518
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:06,759
And that is supposed to make him look brutal and arrogant and prideful.

519
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:07,959
That's her agenda.

520
00:43:08,279 --> 00:43:11,879
And that's and now we can see how far whether she's done it.

521
00:43:11,879 --> 00:43:21,319
But you have to realize that in order to do it, she has to distort the what he's done when he killed Ephigenia.

522
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:23,960
She has to make it seem worse than it is.

523
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:29,319
That's when she says, I just read it.

524
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:34,680
Where he slaughtered her as if he was just killing some cattle in the field.

525
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,399
Where was that?

526
00:43:35,399 --> 00:43:36,359
81?

527
00:43:37,879 --> 00:43:42,440
Part of the speech after she killed him, after she killed Agamemnon?

528
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,919
Yes.

529
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,959
Yes, the middle of 81.

530
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,719
Does this sound fair?

531
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:51,960
I mean, I just reread you what he did.

532
00:43:52,279 --> 00:44:01,799
He slaughtered like a victim his own child, starting a little earlier, with no thought more than if a beast had died when he ranged his pastors and so forth.

533
00:44:01,799 --> 00:44:03,880
He slaughtered like a victim his own child.

534
00:44:03,879 --> 00:44:05,319
Did he not think about it at all?

535
00:44:05,319 --> 00:44:10,119
Did he kill her just as if she was a cow that happened to wander by?

536
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:10,759
Not at all.

537
00:44:10,759 --> 00:44:12,359
He went through great agonies.

538
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:20,999
But you've got to realize that she's setting it up before the murder and justifying it after the murder in the passage on 81.

539
00:44:21,319 --> 00:44:30,680
So and then she so a according to her, the total destruction of Troy was a ruthless sacrifice of young people.

540
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:36,120
Her own daughter, the killing of her daughter was a ruthless sacrifice of that person.

541
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,799
He's a brutal, arrogant, ruthless king.

542
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:43,560
And now the question is, now it gets to be fun.

543
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:50,800
Has she convinced the chorus that he is this bad man that they should kill?

544
00:44:50,799 --> 00:44:57,839
Well, we're going to take a while to find out whether he's convinced that she's convinced the chorus, but there is one person she's totally convinced.

545
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,120
And who is that?

546
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,480
That's Latimer.

547
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:10,080
Latimer, who should know better, in my view, because he says this is not a play of character, about character, but a play about horses.

548
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:21,440
And so it isn't important, you would think, whether Agamemnon was proud or not, whether he was a bad guy or not.

549
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:41,760
But just, but the main thing is, just to stick to the play, does she convince you, and does she convince the chorus that Agamemnon is the kind of guy, let me read my list again, arrogant, ruthless, brutal, prideful, that should be killed?

550
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:44,479
Well, as I say, look at what happens with Latimer.

551
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,919
That's where it gets to be fun.

552
00:45:45,919 --> 00:45:57,680
Latimer, being a good humanist and probably not too bright as far as I can see, seems to think that pride must be the fault, because that's what he learned in high school, I guess.

553
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:03,680
I mean, this has been passed down for 2,000 years since Aristotle wrote the review of Oedipus.

554
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,760
So look what he says on page 12.

555
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:14,880
Pride would have driven him without hesitation to undertake the recovery of Helen.

556
00:46:14,879 --> 00:46:26,159
That's already funny, since nothing in the book shows pride driving him to undertake the recovery of Helen and besiege Troy and so forth.

557
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,919
He puts it in the subjunctive.

558
00:46:27,919 --> 00:46:28,879
Pride would have.

559
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:33,960
But after all, you want to say to Latimer, who cares what you think pride would have done?

560
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:41,000
The question is, did pride lead him to fight this war and sacrifice of Viginia?

561
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,160
Well, after saying it in the conditional, Latimer decides to go all out and just say it as a fact.

562
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:56,120
So about six lines down, or eight, he says, his pride grows like its own acts, and until just before death, he is a swollen vanity.

563
00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:04,279
Now, we're going to read in a minute, tell me telling me, just what he says and does before death, and we're going to see whether he's a swollen vanity.

564
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,719
But that's what he says.

565
00:47:05,719 --> 00:47:10,680
And he says, one cannot see where a proud king could have chosen otherwise.

566
00:47:10,919 --> 00:47:14,600
Okay, now we want to go back and look at what happens when he arrives.

567
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,160
But let me make sure first where I am.

568
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:22,120
So now we're back on the Big Welton speech on page 62.

569
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:33,640
She just made her big speech about him trying to set himself up, trying to set him up, put a spin on everything, in which he looks like a bad guy.

570
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:37,480
And then he comes in at the bottom of 61.

571
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,760
And we've got to see whether he's a bad guy.

572
00:47:40,759 --> 00:47:51,559
He, sort of spookily, on 52, line 910, says to herself, because the audience doesn't know this yet, but the chorus does.

573
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,959
Of course, the Greek audience has seen this over and over.

574
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,320
They like it so much.

575
00:47:55,319 --> 00:48:02,600
So he says, let there spring up into the house he never hoped to see, where justice leads him in, a crimson path.

576
00:48:02,799 --> 00:48:04,880
She hears that as saved.

577
00:48:04,879 --> 00:48:17,360
Justice, meaning the furies, is going, leads him on this crimson carpet, which is blood, the crimson, he's just going to go leave, and he's on his way to do it.

578
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:20,080
And it's true, she knows that, but they don't.

579
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:23,040
Now the question is, she, okay, yeah, go ahead.

580
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:30,400
Ah, well, there's a sub-plot which we have to mention.

581
00:48:31,279 --> 00:48:45,519
He's talking about Cassandra, they all get, the heroes, a woman, slave mistress, as part of the reward for winning, and he's got his reward, and he has sort of every right to it.

582
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:51,759
And if you watch, the chorus never complains or blames him for having brought home Cassandra.

583
00:48:51,919 --> 00:48:58,560
Clytemnestra does, but not because she really knows that it was a bad thing, because it wasn't a bad thing by their standards.

584
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:04,719
It's because she's finding everything she can to complain about and throw at him in her speech.

585
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:10,799
But don't let the Cassandra issue bother you.

586
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:26,799
Those who know the Iliad know that the same kind of issue comes up at the beginning of the Iliad because Agamemnon tries to take away Priseus, who is Achilles' slave mistress prize, and Achilles is very upset about it.

587
00:49:26,799 --> 00:49:32,480
They care a lot about having the right recognition of their greatness.

588
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,320
But let me go back to this.

589
00:49:35,279 --> 00:49:38,239
So now Agamemnon has come home.

590
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:39,919
Clytemner's had her chance.

591
00:49:39,919 --> 00:49:41,120
It's like a debate.

592
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,119
She put her spin on the whole thing.

593
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,320
I just read it.

594
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:52,719
And now, look, and now Latimore says he is a swollen vanity, totally puffed up with pride.

595
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:54,000
He must be.

596
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,920
He would have to be because this is a tragedy.

597
00:49:57,919 --> 00:50:01,199
And so we're going to find out whether he is a swollen vanity.

598
00:50:01,279 --> 00:50:02,120
What has happened?

599
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:02,839
Read this speech.

600
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:05,960
He's got his good speech writers, too.

601
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,879
He says, where does he start talking?

602
00:50:10,919 --> 00:50:13,000
Ah, here we are, bottom of 62.

603
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,879
Daughter of Leda, that's Clytemnestra.

604
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:18,680
You have kept my house for me.

605
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,639
There is one, you who have kept my house for me.

606
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:24,599
There is one way your welcome matched my absence well.

607
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,520
You strained it to great length.

608
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,800
That's a joke.

609
00:50:27,799 --> 00:50:34,520
She's saying, well, I was gone for 10 years, but your welcome speech when I got back was just about as long.

610
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,199
And that's a great way to begin.

611
00:50:36,359 --> 00:50:40,760
I mean, it's not what you normally expect from a proud and puffed up king.

612
00:50:40,759 --> 00:50:46,120
And he goes on to explain why he thinks it was a bad idea for her to give this speech.

613
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:50,759
Yet properly to praise me thus belongs by right to others' lips, not yours.

614
00:50:50,759 --> 00:50:58,600
I mean, he doesn't want to be praised by his wife if he's done something good, let some impartial person say so, not yours.

615
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:07,320
And all this, and all this, do not try in women's ways to make me delicate, as if I were some Asiatic.

616
00:51:07,319 --> 00:51:17,960
The Greeks are always worried about the Persians, who are the Asiatics for them, who have absolute monarchs and who bow down to these absolute monarchs.

617
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:34,039
And he wants to say, notice, he says, don't bow down to me as if I were some Asiatic, bow down to earth, and with wide mouth cry out to me, nor cross my path with jealousy.

618
00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:36,040
Now comes the next thing.

619
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,879
Don't make a big fuss about me.

620
00:51:37,879 --> 00:51:39,160
You're my wife.

621
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:44,199
Don't make me seem to be some kind of superhero that everybody should bow down to.

622
00:51:44,199 --> 00:51:47,680
That's not our Greek democratic way of doing things.

623
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:52,560
And now finally, don't make people jealous by strewing the ground with robes.

624
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:56,480
Such state becomes the gods and none besides.

625
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,359
Okay, that's, she's put down this crimson carpet.

626
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:05,120
Now you have to know, because there's a big fuss going to be made about the crimson carpet, why it's so important.

627
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:08,080
The crimson carpet is not a carpet.

628
00:52:08,799 --> 00:52:10,399
It's robes, according to this.

629
00:52:10,399 --> 00:52:13,359
It must be kind of like the vetments that a priest wears.

630
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:17,840
I mean, very, very fancy robes or a kind of tapestry.

631
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:22,160
Something extremely beautiful and precious and valuable.

632
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:27,839
And as I say to myself, it's as if it's the family paintings.

633
00:52:27,919 --> 00:52:33,759
The Picasso's and Matistas are off the wall and on the floor, and she wants him to walk in on them.

634
00:52:33,759 --> 00:52:40,320
She wants him to walk in on the thing that's most beautiful, most precious, most valuable in their collection, and he doesn't want to do it.

635
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:51,199
And so he says, this proud, puffed-up vanity, such state becomes the gods and none besides that are walking on these beautiful things.

636
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:52,719
I am a mortal man.

637
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:58,239
I cannot trample upon these tinted splendors without fear thrown in my path.

638
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:01,520
I tell you, as a man, not God to reverence me.

639
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:06,719
Well, boy, does that, to me anyway, not sound like a puffed-up, arrogant person.

640
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:09,839
He is really out, you know, outmaneuvering her.

641
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:16,239
She's set it up so that he's supposed to walk in on these beautiful robes, and he's not falling for it.

642
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:17,439
The chorus is watching.

643
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,080
You're the judge.

644
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,120
You're the chorus.

645
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:26,239
And she's trying to set him up as vain and brutal and proud and a kind of dictator.

646
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:28,640
And he's presenting himself.

647
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:34,199
I mean, it's all a question of spin before the crowd, as a completely modest, nice guy.

648
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:35,399
And there's no reason to doubt it.

649
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:39,640
He's begun with a joke, and he said, then don't mess with those carpets.

650
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:40,360
Yeah.

651
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,280
Well, good question.

652
00:53:42,279 --> 00:53:44,359
And he did walk on the carpets finally.

653
00:53:44,359 --> 00:53:45,160
He's right.

654
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,479
But notice why he walks on the carpets.

655
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,000
It's quite amazing.

656
00:53:50,199 --> 00:53:57,479
He said, if I do it, I'm sorry, discordant is the murmur at such treading down of lovely things.

657
00:53:57,799 --> 00:54:02,680
And call that man blessed who had sweet tranquility has brought his life to a close.

658
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,159
I could only act as such, and so forth.

659
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,119
He's being seemingly modest.

660
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:11,959
And she says, Yeah, tell me this one thing and do not cross my will.

661
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,799
She's tough, Earthwide Nestra.

662
00:54:13,879 --> 00:54:16,199
Agamemnon says, My will is mine.

663
00:54:16,199 --> 00:54:17,960
I shall not make it soft for you.

664
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,880
They're having a family fight.

665
00:54:19,879 --> 00:54:21,959
She's saying, walk on the carpet.

666
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,600
And he's saying, no, I won't walk on the carpet.

667
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:28,839
And whether he does or not, a lot depends on it because the crowd is watching.

668
00:54:28,919 --> 00:54:30,439
Is he going to walk on the carpet?

669
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:33,479
She says, it was so and so and so-and-so.

670
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,000
Lots of talk.

671
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,719
And then he says at the bottom, the people murmur, and their voice and strength is great.

672
00:54:39,719 --> 00:54:44,520
And he says, yet, who goes unenvied shall not be admired.

673
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:49,000
He says, remember earlier, if I walk on this, the people will be jealous and envy me.

674
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,840
And she's saying, well, if you want to be admired, you better do it.

675
00:54:52,839 --> 00:54:57,000
And he doesn't say, okay, well, I do want to be admired, so I'll do it.

676
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,280
He says, such lust for conflict is not woman-like.

677
00:55:00,279 --> 00:55:04,520
And she says, yet for the mighty to give way is grace.

678
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,080
She says, oh, you're such a great guy.

679
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:11,080
You will be able the best thing you could do is do what I want you to do.

680
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:16,040
And so he finally says, Does such a victory mean so much to you?

681
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,319
And she says, Oh, yield, the power is yours.

682
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:20,000
Give way of your free will.

683
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:24,640
He is certainly not eagerly walking on the carpet.

684
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:32,799
He's really such a nice guy, and she's such an awful monster, that he's giving in to her and letting her set him up.

685
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:38,560
Finally, he says, since you must have it, here let someone with all speed take off these sandals.

686
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,839
So I'm certainly not going to walk on that carpet with my pigotine, he says.

687
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:44,640
And he really cares about that nice carpet.

688
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:52,399
And as I crush these garments stained from the rich sea, that means that they're purple, and you have to kill lots of little sea creatures to get purple.

689
00:55:52,399 --> 00:55:55,520
It's very hard to get in those days and very valuable.

690
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,959
Let no God's eye of hatred strike me from afar.

691
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:06,079
Great the extravagance and great the shame I feel to spoil such pleasure and such silver's worth of web.

692
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:10,719
Well, I ask you, is this an arrogant, selfish, puffed-up man?

693
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:13,040
I mean, there isn't a hint of him.

694
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,959
I mean, maybe he's completely faking it, but why should we think so?

695
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:23,039
And I think sort of the beginning of the joke is makes it clear that, no, no, he's really a modest, nice guy.

696
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:27,680
I don't see how anybody could doubt him, except Latimer, of course.

697
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
So we've got to get to Latimer.

698
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:37,280
He takes off his sandals, and the question is, is this what Latimer calls fatal pride?

699
00:56:37,279 --> 00:56:44,719
It better be fatal pride if this is going to be a humanist tragedy, because if he doesn't show fatal pride, then he shouldn't be killed.

700
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:50,079
So he must be a bad, proud little guy, because he's about to be killed.

701
00:56:50,640 --> 00:57:00,959
It's just a little above the middle of 22, where uh Latimer just says of him uh the the about Agamemnon's fatal pride, about fifteen lines down.

702
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:06,999
I mean, that just puts the Aristotelian Sophocles Shakespeare story in two sentences.

703
00:57:07,239 --> 00:57:15,879
If you've got pride you're going to have bad things happen to you and it's sort of a syllogism for Latimer and bad things happen to Agamemnon so he must have had pride.

704
00:57:15,879 --> 00:57:20,600
Never mind wha wh whether he looks like a nice guy or not.

705
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:27,399
But the question, the really question you should ask yourself is, did he convince the chorus or did she convince the chorus?

706
00:57:27,399 --> 00:57:31,080
Do they think he's a monster or do they think he's a nice guy?

707
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:35,320
Well it turns out they think he's a great man.

708
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:53,640
You hear it on page 85 when after he's dead they are talking about what happened and they say at the end of the long chorus speech in the middle of the page who over this great man's grave shall lay the blessing of tears worked soberly from a true heart.

709
00:57:53,640 --> 00:58:00,680
Well, I mean you just got to pay attention and you can see that she's not convinced them.

710
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:09,479
There is talk, I have to tell you this, because smart students have told me this every once in a while and I they're right.

711
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:14,840
There's talk of pride, but it's and it's so it's you've got to go look at 58.

712
00:58:14,839 --> 00:58:17,480
The question is, who's pride?

713
00:58:17,719 --> 00:58:19,800
Is it Agamemnon's?

714
00:58:19,799 --> 00:58:22,600
And the answer is, no, it's not Agamemnon's.

715
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:28,359
She's talking about the original pride boys, Thyestes and who's the other one?

716
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:29,479
Atreus.

717
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:43,399
And so in the middle of the page, but pride, aging is made in men's dark actions, right with the young pride, late or soon, when the dawn of destiny comes and birth is given.

718
00:58:43,719 --> 00:58:45,640
Birth is given to the spirits.

719
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:46,959
Those are the spirits in the house.

720
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,239
That's where the fury started.

721
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:51,119
Birth is given to the spirits, none they fight nor beat down.

722
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:56,880
Sinful daring in those halls, the sinful daring in those halls aren't his halls.

723
00:58:56,879 --> 00:59:01,440
They're the halls of the Acreus family and so forth.

724
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:09,440
And there's more talk about pride on 66, but it's again not Agamemnon's pride.

725
00:59:11,919 --> 00:59:17,280
Yet it is true, the high strength of men knows no content with limitations.

726
00:59:17,279 --> 00:59:19,360
Well, that's Hubris, all right.

727
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:24,799
And it isn't clear who it is, but it doesn't seem to be Agamemnon.

728
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:30,320
I think it's the people, the original people.

729
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,000
Keep your eyes open.

730
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:43,600
See if you find any place where Aeschylus gives you any hint that Agamemnon is a bad guy and not just a hero.

731
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:50,719
At the beginning of the libation bearers, it's clear that he's become, that he's a hero.

732
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:55,280
I'll tell you in a minute how Latimer handled that.

733
00:59:55,279 --> 00:59:57,600
But where are you going to find it?

734
00:59:57,919 --> 01:00:05,040
I wasn't going to mention it, but now I want to mention maybe I can't mention it because I wasn't prepared to do it.

735
01:00:06,879 --> 01:00:08,559
Well, I'll wait till I get to it.

736
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:10,080
Anyway, we've seen enough.

737
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:13,040
The question is: can Latimer fix it?

738
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,520
Is there a place that defends him?

739
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,920
Well, there is a place that defends him.

740
01:00:17,919 --> 01:00:22,960
And that's interesting, too, and blew my mind when I saw it.

741
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:30,560
That is, that when he, as soon as he's dead, he's called a great man.

742
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:35,640
And so that the dead king is now treated as a hero.

743
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:41,560
I've got to read the place in the libation bearers where he's treated as a hero.

744
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,719
Okay, I'll take a look for a second.

745
01:00:43,799 --> 01:00:46,040
If I don't find it, you find it.

746
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:53,960
But they say this dear king whom we love was killed, and that's terrible.

747
01:00:54,199 --> 01:01:01,320
Oh, in the chorus at the beginning of the libation bearers, I think.

748
01:01:01,319 --> 01:01:02,279
Well, it's there.

749
01:01:02,279 --> 01:01:03,479
Keep your eyes open.

750
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,279
But it doesn't matter.

751
01:01:04,279 --> 01:01:06,440
I've got my quote about the great man.

752
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,960
And the question is now: how is Vatimar going to deal with this?

753
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:12,360
Well, he says two-thirds of the way down.

754
01:01:12,359 --> 01:01:16,440
See, he doesn't disagree with me that the people treat him as a hero.

755
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:23,000
They don't, the chorus of people has not taken him, taken it at all good riddance when he got killed.

756
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,079
He says the dead king is now a hero.

757
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:30,120
His arrogance, you heard it here, and you read it.

758
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,319
I don't see any arrogance.

759
01:01:31,319 --> 01:01:36,599
But his arrogance and his mistakes have been a know by death, and his grave is a center of power.

760
01:01:36,839 --> 01:01:49,880
He's responding to the place which I can't find, where at the beginning of the libation bearers, they're all around Agamemnon's grave supporting him and praying for him to help them get rid of Aegisthus and Clytemnestra.

761
01:01:49,879 --> 01:01:53,319
Well, so what if Vladimir tries this quick fix?

762
01:01:53,319 --> 01:01:55,239
He says, well, it's because he's dead.

763
01:01:55,239 --> 01:01:57,320
But that doesn't really make any sense.

764
01:01:57,319 --> 01:02:01,160
It's still not clear that he's done anything wrong.

765
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:11,560
And Agamemnon admits that he's become the center of power, that his grave is a hero's grave, and so forth.

766
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:14,759
So, then what is just a second?

767
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:18,480
Now I've got another surprise.

768
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:30,160
What I want is a place where the translation is crucial to what's going on, and where Latimer messes up with the trans makes the translation fit.

769
01:02:30,879 --> 01:02:32,479
I can't find it, that's something.

770
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,199
Uh-huh.

771
01:02:33,279 --> 01:02:45,440
We've killed Agamemnon, and now she's killed him, and the chorus now turns toward Clytemnestra, and the leader speaks to her.

772
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,519
It's the top before that, the first whole section.

773
01:02:51,839 --> 01:03:01,680
They're talking about the death of Clydemnia, of the Phaginia, and they say, justice so moves that those only learn who suffer.

774
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:10,320
Now, doesn't that sound like that's at least an echo of the Aristotelian view that you learn through suffering?

775
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:15,840
Now, if you just look at the play and ask yourself, did Agamemnon learn anything through his suffering?

776
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:17,600
No, he never knew what hit him.

777
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:25,600
He didn't have to, for one thing, he didn't need to learn anything because he hadn't done anything wrong, or at least what he did wrong was what the culture forced him to do, not his character.

778
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,919
But mainly, there's no catharsis.

779
01:03:27,919 --> 01:03:31,199
There's no moment where Agamemnon says, oh, now I see.

780
01:03:31,199 --> 01:03:33,039
It's my fatal pride that did it.

781
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,280
And then he doesn't see anything.

782
01:03:35,279 --> 01:03:37,360
And so what's going on there?

783
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:43,280
Well, the translation is messed up.

784
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:50,000
What it says in the Greek, it seems, is, wisdom comes at the price of suffering.

785
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,799
Yeah, sure, wisdom comes at the price of suffering.

786
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:57,199
But it's not individuals who learn through suffering.

787
01:03:57,199 --> 01:04:00,560
It's the whole culture who learns through suffering.

788
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:03,000
Again and again we're told that.

789
01:04:03,399 --> 01:04:11,799
Just to take one right nearby on page 40, where the chorus saying for the dozenth time, where is it?

790
01:04:11,799 --> 01:04:17,479
Sorrow, sorrow, but good went out in the little above the middle.

791
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:23,000
Who's who guided men to think who's laid it down that wisdom comes alone through suffering?

792
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,199
That's right.

793
01:04:24,199 --> 01:04:28,279
What's not right is that, how did I read it again?

794
01:04:28,279 --> 01:04:35,080
Let's go back to 42, that those only learn who suffer.

795
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:44,280
That switch, that wisdom comes to the culture through suffering, is Escalian ontological tragedy.

796
01:04:44,279 --> 01:04:50,280
The whole culture has to suffer before they finally get out of the situation that's making everybody miserable.

797
01:04:50,279 --> 01:04:54,039
I gave you the example of you could use South Africa.

798
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:55,639
Oh, I didn't talk about that.

799
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:59,160
You can use what happens to the gays, what happens to women.

800
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:02,199
It's not individuals who do things wrong.

801
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:12,680
Nobody could do things right if the women are treated a bad way, or the blacks are treated a bad way in South Africa, or gays are treated a bad way.

802
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:15,399
And everybody suffers until you get out of it.

803
01:05:15,399 --> 01:05:18,040
That's ontological tragedy.

804
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:33,080
And the idea, the other one, those only learn who suffer, is to flip it over into Sophocles and say those individuals who have bad character and pride have to suffer in order to learn that their pride was a bad thing.

805
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:36,440
That's Lear and Macbeth and so forth.

806
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:50,080
Okay, and so finally, the translator himself sort of sets up the, who changes the translation to fit his Sophoclean reading of it.

807
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:53,600
And you've got to admit that it's very strange because he's the one who said it.

808
01:05:53,839 --> 01:06:01,759
Remember, it seems like years ago, I read the quote where he says, well, Sophoclean tragedy went inward to character and individuals.

809
01:06:01,919 --> 01:06:03,920
Athlus did something different.

810
01:06:03,919 --> 01:06:06,559
But oddly enough, Latimer never gets it.

811
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:15,359
And the only reason he never gets it is this humanist tradition from Aristotle is so strong that nobody sees what's in front of them.

812
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:17,840
At least, I'm checking with you.

813
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:20,000
If you think I'm wrong, you have to come and tell me.

814
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:43,120
I would say that it's absolutely clear that Agamemnon is not a puffed up, arrogant, brutal, vain person, and that these guys for 2,000 years haven't been able to read the text because they got into this psychological, humanist, ontic way, and they believe they see pride even if it isn't there.

815
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:47,600
And that's why I say this partly because I say, isn't that fun?

816
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,519
I saw it, but I didn't see it by myself.

817
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:56,080
I saw it over the last few years with the help of the people who came to office hours and so forth, bit by bit.

818
01:06:56,080 --> 01:07:05,599
And my moral is, you guys are better able to understand this text than people like Latimer, because you're not in the rut of 2,000 years of tradition.

819
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:08,160
Before I call on you, I saw another hand that I didn't call on.

820
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:09,279
Was you, Dave?

821
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:11,919
It's not a pride.

822
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,560
It was not a problem.

823
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:17,199
Yeah.

824
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:18,079
Okay.

825
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:20,560
Something, it's very subtle.

826
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:21,759
I agree with you.

827
01:07:21,759 --> 01:07:22,959
The way it's set up.

828
01:07:22,959 --> 01:07:28,959
And it's certainly the killing of Ephiganiah is not a wrong thing that they did.

829
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:36,119
Or at least it's known, he had to do something equally wrong if he let the men starve or went home.

830
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:47,399
But he does, when he finally makes up his mind to do it, he does it, his breath comes sacrilegious and he gags her and he does it brutally.

831
01:07:47,400 --> 01:08:00,680
But all I want to say about that is nobody is, I mean, it isn't as if that's some kind of tragic flaw for which he suffers and learns something.

832
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:06,279
I mean, I don't think he ever, I don't think the chorus ever accepts that it's a flaw.

833
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:08,039
I don't think they harp on it.

834
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:11,399
They think he's a hero and a great guy.

835
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,320
So, but I think you're right.

836
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,879
It's a little more nuanced than I let on.

837
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:18,999
The crucial lines that he's worried about, let's look at them.

838
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:29,480
And the moment in which, the one moment in which Agamemnon sort of gets out of control, I don't think it's pride, neither do you.

839
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:33,079
You say it's a kind of, he gets just carried away.

840
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,520
And he.

841
01:08:35,959 --> 01:08:36,520
Where is it?

842
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,719
Does anybody know?

843
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,480
It's on the right-hand side.

844
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:41,719
Oh, here it is on page 41.

845
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:45,319
The crucial lines are: he doesn't want to do it.

846
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:46,839
He thinks it's terrible.

847
01:08:47,560 --> 01:09:03,479
He can't, I mean, either he's going to be disdained as king by all the citizens, or he's going to be hated as a child murderer by his wife.

848
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:10,039
So the situation is terrible that when necessity's yoke was put upon him, I mean, he had to do one or the other.

849
01:09:10,039 --> 01:09:21,039
And so then, and this is where he changed, and from the heart, the breath came bitter and sacrilegious, utterly infidel, to warp a will now to stop at nothing.

850
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:25,440
The sickening in men's mind, tough and reckless, cruelty brings daring.

851
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:33,279
He endured them to sacrifice his daughter to stay the strength of the war, wage for a woman, first offering to the ship's state.

852
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:34,239
And who's talking?

853
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:35,680
The chorus, presumably.

854
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,279
Who else could it be?

855
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,919
And I take it, yes.

856
01:09:39,919 --> 01:09:56,560
And they see that, what you're pointing out, that when he did it, he did it in a kind of fit of being sort of so upset and so forced to do this brutal thing.

857
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:05,919
But I still want to say you certainly can't build on that, that he was falling in vanity and that it's all punishment for pride.

858
01:10:05,919 --> 01:10:10,640
And I think this not stepping on the carpet scene is supposed to convince you of that.

859
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:20,319
But what you have to look for when you reread it, when you're writing papers on it and thinking about it, is you have to ask yourself, what does the chorus think?

860
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:25,279
We're supposed to, I mean, normally you can't be sure you can trust the chorus because they're just citizens.

861
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:28,959
They're not all a bunch of very wise people.

862
01:10:28,959 --> 01:10:31,359
But in this case, it's like a jury.

863
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,919
What the chorus decides is sort of the truth.

864
01:10:33,919 --> 01:10:47,520
The whole argument is to present the case that Agamemnon is a kind of person that deserves to be killed, or whether, or is Agamemnon a hero and a beloved king?

865
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,079
And the chorus takes him to be a hero.

866
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:56,399
And in the next play, in a passage I can't find when they're gathered around his tomb, they take him to be the beloved king.

867
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,799
Somebody else first, you had your hand up.

868
01:10:58,759 --> 01:11:03,399
Yeah, if I remember from a long time ago, those Ilya.

869
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,640
I don't remember it so well, but I didn't know.

870
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:06,919
No, good, good.

871
01:11:07,079 --> 01:11:12,199
You see, you're saying that as if you're disagreeing with me, but you're, of course, really agreeing with me.

872
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:12,999
Maybe you mean to.

873
01:11:12,999 --> 01:11:13,399
Good.

874
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:28,199
It's important that in the Iliad, if somebody were trying to make a case that Agamemnon was proud and had no sense of the situation and was doing something really bad and that he would regret it, you could go to the Iliad.

875
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:39,479
When he takes back Priseus, Achilles' mistress, he is doing something stupid and he insists on it, and it gets him into big trouble.

876
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:42,680
And notice that none of that gets into this play.

877
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,520
That's what you're saying and I'm saying.

878
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:50,520
If Agamemnon, if if Aeschylus wanted to show that Agamemnon was a bad guy, he could cite Homer.

879
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:53,159
But he certainly, but he doesn't cite Homer.

880
01:11:53,159 --> 01:11:54,600
Okay, and now, Beatrice.

881
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:54,759
Yeah.

882
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:55,719
Yeah?

883
01:11:58,119 --> 01:12:00,039
I don't think Darwin used to make.

884
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:00,839
Where is it?

885
01:12:00,839 --> 01:12:02,039
Let's read it.

886
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:09,319
When they say Marcius got to be long, I could go there and say a lot more than okay.

887
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,719
Look, though, I mean, that's interesting.

888
01:12:11,719 --> 01:12:15,959
That's because he's in the Atreus tradition.

889
01:12:15,959 --> 01:12:19,079
I mean, it's ontological and not psychological.

890
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:23,640
It's something that they don't say what a bad guy, right?

891
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:28,600
But they do say that they expect that he's going to be killed.

892
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:34,359
But they don't think he's going to be killed because he personally, because of his character, was prideful and sinful.

893
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:38,919
He's one of the part of the Atreus revenge drama.

894
01:12:38,919 --> 01:12:43,959
Okay, I've only got three minutes, so I want to set you up to read the La Libation Bearers.

895
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:45,839
That's very important.

896
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:48,319
And so I'm going to just skip to it.

897
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:57,919
So Clytemnestra thinks that now that Agamemnon is dead, they can stomp the cycle of Fury Vengeance.

898
01:12:57,919 --> 01:13:00,719
It fits with what Beatrice is talking about.

899
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:05,999
And she tries to say that this is going to be the last of those murders.

900
01:13:05,999 --> 01:13:07,520
Can you claim that I've done this?

901
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:19,680
Speak to me nevermore as the wife of Agamemnon in the shadow of this corpse's queen, the old stark avenger of Atreus, that's the Fury, for his rebel of hate struck down this man, last blood for the slaughtered children.

902
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:27,839
So she wants to think that she was a tool of the fury and that the cycle of vengeance is now over.

903
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:35,520
And the chorus, too, hope and think maybe the cycle of vengeance is now over on 88.

904
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:42,079
So at the bottom, must it be the wife who killed to curse the country and the gods within the ground?

905
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:55,039
Oh, can Orestes live and be in sunlight still, shall fate grow gracious, bringing him back again in strength, back again in strength of hand to overcome these murderers.

906
01:13:55,039 --> 01:13:58,479
So what are you going to look for when you read the next play?

907
01:13:58,799 --> 01:14:02,239
The question, it's clear that Orestes is going to come back.

908
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:06,719
It's clear that Orestes is going to have to kill Clytemnestra and Aegisthus.

909
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:13,919
And the question is now what was about to come out of my mouth was, because they killed his father.

910
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:17,439
And if he does that, will the cycle of vengeance be over?

911
01:14:17,759 --> 01:14:20,560
No, that will be just the next one.

912
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:26,640
Or is he going to come back and kill them because they killed the king?

913
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:29,119
In which case, he's not doing it in the name of the Furies.

914
01:14:29,119 --> 01:14:32,199
He's doing it in the name of the gods of legal order.

915
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:36,279
And this is a a regicide, and regicides need to be killed.

916
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:37,959
And it's not a Fury action at all.

917
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:40,680
So here's what you have to ask yourself as you read it.

918
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:43,799
And this is what the chorus is asking itself constantly.

919
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:54,759
Is he going to do this deed as an agent of the Furies because they killed his father?

920
01:14:54,759 --> 01:15:02,919
Or is he going to do this deed as a representative of the rightful legal king order?

921
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:09,959
Everything that which one happens will determine whether the curse on the house of Atreus stops or not.

922
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:20,759
And the people are on the edge of their seats, and you should be too, as this debate goes back and forth for a long time as to what is his motive.

923
01:15:20,759 --> 01:15:21,159
Yes.

924
01:15:21,159 --> 01:15:23,719
Oh, of course, they all thought they were putting justice in place.

925
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,520
The question is, which kind of justice?

926
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:32,119
Is this going to be done in the name of Fury justice or in the name of Apollo justice?

927
01:15:32,119 --> 01:15:42,919
And it's complicated, and you'll see, and you try to figure out for yourself in the end in the end which happened and what happened when it happened.

928
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:49,719
Okay, I've got to run to a meeting, so I can't stay around and talk as I usually do after where I'm acting out.
