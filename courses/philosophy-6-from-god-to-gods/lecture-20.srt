1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,400
I went very fast, too fast, last time, over Virgil's explanation in the middle of the poem of the whole moral layout of the poem and the evidence that Dante really understood that that was wrong.

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:40,239
Not totally wrong, but as I keep saying, correct but not true, by which I mean Virgil saying things that correspond roughly to moral distinctions, which are not out of line much with the Christian distinctions, but nonetheless, pretty different, uh I'm going to come back.

3
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:55,319
I decided that the way to do things was to be sure we finished all of the purgatory so that but this today and be ready to go on to the Paradiso next Tuesday, because we only have Tuesday and Thursday to finish the Divine Comedy.

4
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:04,360
And when I finish what I want to say about the rest of the Paradiso, I'll go back to the middle of the paradiso, keep me straight.

5
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:17,560
When I finish what I want to say today about the purgatory, I'll go back to the middle of the purgatory, which is the middle of the whole poem, which is where Virgil explains everything and goes wrong.

6
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,639
It's not absolutely clear whether Dante knows he goes wrong or not, and I'll talk about that.

7
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:50,119
I've already been mentioning that there's the sort of impossible job of being an articulator when what you're trying to articulate, namely this new revelation that Jesus has brought to the culture, in the categories, the concepts, the definitions, and all that of the Greeks, either Plato or Aristotle or Stoics or a kind of mixture of all of that.

8
00:01:50,120 --> 00:02:05,479
So poor Dante has got, on the one hand, the Troubadours with their view about total love, which is somewhat related to what Jesus was going around saying according to the New Testament.

9
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:09,079
And then we've got, but Dante also reads and is impressed by St.

10
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,400
Thomas Aquinas, who's trying to map the whole thing onto Aristotle.

11
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,120
And so I think, I just don't know how confused Dante is.

12
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:26,199
Rereading it again this year, I get confused about trying to figure out, does he understand here?

13
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,039
Here, I'm just saying things that are on my mind.

14
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:48,639
I wasn't going to start with this, but what's bothering me right now, and you can keep an eye open for it, is the relation between the three stars and the four stars, which are talked about in the middle of the poem, which you see, and the four stars are setting and the three stars are rising in the middle of the poem.

15
00:02:48,639 --> 00:03:11,760
To begin with, you've got to say that allegorically, that is symbolically, the four stars stand for the four classic antique time of Plato and Aristotle virtues, which were wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance.

16
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:30,640
And temperance is the big problem, because temperance says, particularly the way Virgil understands it, from a Stoic angle, never let yourself get too excited and upset about anything and never desire anything too intensely because nothing can really satisfy you.

17
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,679
And the three stars are faith, hope, and love.

18
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,960
The Christian verdict has been going up purgatory, the way the astronomy works.

19
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,039
The four stars are dropping out, and Virgil is dropping out.

20
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,640
We'll talk about that today.

21
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,520
And the three stars are becoming prominent.

22
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,880
So far, so good.

23
00:03:51,200 --> 00:04:20,359
The important question, I think, this year anyway, is when you want to understand Dante as articulator and his problem, is it the case that the four stars are, is there a kind of layer cake view of the relation of antiquity and those pagans to the Christians, where the pagan virtues are all correct, they just don't cover the whole thing.

24
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:26,359
And after you've got courage, temperance, wisdom, and justice, you have to add faith, hope, and love.

25
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:30,200
That's the wrong way to think about it, it seems to me.

26
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:48,360
And I'll try to argue how today Dante sort of runs full glass into the wrong way to think about it, which is the interesting way to think about it, which is that love trumps everything and transforms everything so that the four virtues aren't even virtues anymore after Christianity comes along.

27
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:50,599
We can see it most clearly in temperance.

28
00:04:50,599 --> 00:05:02,439
Temperance isn't a virtue in a religion where ecstatic oral devotion is the best thing you can do.

29
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:14,439
And whenever Virgil talks about temperance, it was either on the circle of heretics in the Inferno or in the circle of sloth in the purgatory.

30
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,159
And the punishment is always people running around trying to get excited.

31
00:05:19,159 --> 00:05:29,319
And being excited is what comes out of the Christian story, being ecstatic, being totally, highly, emotionally involved.

32
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,880
So the moral is either you go with St.

33
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:45,880
Thomas and believe that the four stars are still around, and then you just add the three Christian virtues, all of them very irrational and very different in terms of hope, love.

34
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:52,199
And you either think that the four stars are just gone now, and there are three big, better stars.

35
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,440
And sometimes Dante seems to write that way.

36
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,600
And then just when you think, boy, he's got it, the three stars have replaced the four stars, the four stars are still around.

37
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:04,039
They're just taking up a rather minor position.

38
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:04,840
That's the St.

39
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,320
Thomas.

40
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:17,280
So now I think of Dante as the four articulator caught between the the the s the bot the Bible articulation of what Jesus was doing and St.

41
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:29,280
Paul's which we don't read which was the one who made the big fuss about faith hope and love so Dante's caught between that and the the Thomistic stuff that St.

42
00:06:29,359 --> 00:07:52,680
Thomas has worked out using Aristotle and he's in a hopeless mess so that when he tries to explain all this it just doesn't add up and in a way that's interesting too it occurs to me in a way he's a funny kind of articulator who articulates the mess but not the normal job okay that's what I want to get back to either at the end of the whole discussion of the divine comedy or at the end of today but I you should keep your eyes open all the time for the question is Virgil getting Christianity right is if he isn't getting it right does Dante understand that he isn't getting it right this is so hard to keep clear about but there's some things that's easy to keep clear so let's switch to that for now so we are now ready to go to the top of purgatory the top of purgatory is as usual the nicest and most fun because that's always the lovers the lovers are at the top of the inferno because they're the least bad because they've got the wrong desires, but they have turned against go and tried to cut down their desires or to reject God or reject God's creation and so forth and but they but they've got they've unfortunately put each other in the place of God.

43
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:58,280
They've totally, they are totally devoted to each other, Powell and Francesca.

44
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:01,000
Well, now, and they're just stuck like that.

45
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,240
That's what it is to be in the inferno.

46
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:14,679
But in the purgatory, you expect a punishment which is to reverse the crime, which looks like a kind of Nicky Mouse stupid thing to do in the inferno.

47
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,879
Why would you sort of put people into the eternally reversal of their crime?

48
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:25,400
Remember the crazy things like cutting seismatics in half and turning fortune tellers around?

49
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:28,040
I realize that fortune tellers, we still have them.

50
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:36,040
They're now called futurologists, and companies pay them lots of money to predict, give them scenarios about the future.

51
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,720
Dante would put them in hell, and I think that might be a good idea.

52
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:46,680
But I think turning their heads around so that they have to walk in a direction they can't see.

53
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:55,800
You could see how that's sort of fitting if you hate futurologists, but it's certainly not very illuminating about their condition or state of mind.

54
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:04,200
So now you'd expect, in the purgatory, also punishments which seem to reverse the crime.

55
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,080
But I said this last time, and it's important to remember.

56
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:13,720
You expect here punishments that reverse the crime in the way that if you're an addict, you diet.

57
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,480
And that is, you do some, if you're prideful, you walk around and bent over.

58
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:29,160
And if you're a glutton, you, well, that's why I said, you abstain from the food that you find so attractive.

59
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,680
So, what do these lovers do?

60
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,040
Do you remember?

61
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:47,359
For one thing, there seem to be, and that's sort of nice, homosexual lovers and heterosexual lovers, with Dante making no particular distinction between them and seeming to know a lot of the homosexual lovers who are fellow poets of his.

62
00:09:47,680 --> 00:10:04,640
And they aren't, I mean, apparently the homosexual lovers in the Inferno were cruising around in groups, whereas these seem to be pairs, monogamous partner lovers.

63
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:19,040
And when they're monogamous partner lovers, Dante doesn't separate them or condemn them, which is very radical and original of him, since the church then and now condemns the homosexual lovers as unnatural.

64
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,560
Dante just thinks the promiscuity is unnatural and puts them in hell.

65
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,400
So, what is the punishment of the lovers?

66
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,760
Do you remember?

67
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,120
Anybody?

68
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,080
Well, you can make it up, sort of.

69
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:44,480
They're walking around in these circles in which some are going this way and some are going this way, and when they cross their lover, they have only a very brief kiss, and then they go on.

70
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:47,680
That's the reversal kind of story.

71
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:55,120
So I say in here, look back at page 257.

72
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,280
Why 257?

73
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:58,560
Oh, I see.

74
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,119
Oh, yeah, there's two other, there's another issue.

75
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,359
I really took it up more.

76
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:07,200
Oh, let's go to 265 because that completes what I am just saying.

77
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:16,160
On 265, which is Canto 26, which at line 31, what does Dante see?

78
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:26,680
He says, I saw them hurrying from either side, and each shade kissed another without pausing, each for the briefest greeting, by the briefest greeting, satisfied.

79
00:11:27,239 --> 00:11:32,039
So that's the reversal.

80
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:45,080
They were trying to get over their total addiction, adoration of each other, and get it to be appropriate, which is to be strong but not total.

81
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:50,200
So, and now we have to ask, and what's Dante's relation to this?

82
00:11:50,519 --> 00:12:03,480
Given that he's a complete Beatrice fanatic whose whole life spent writing poems to Beatrice and writing this poem like no one has ever written about their girlfriend before, as he says.

83
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:08,520
And so, well, Dante's relation to it is just what you'd expect.

84
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,760
He's very, talk about punishments that he's in danger of going into.

85
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:18,840
Remember, I said anger, which you didn't read, but he's a very angry guy.

86
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,479
But also, he was too involved with Paul and Francesca.

87
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,879
He was too involved with his old teacher.

88
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:31,160
I mentioned that again, who was homosexual, and Dante gets right into the punishment with him.

89
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:40,599
He was too involved with Odysseus, and so she almost fell into the punishment because he's so tempted by the idea that you should explore new worlds.

90
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:54,440
And now, here he is, of course, in real trouble on this level, and 257, which is Canto 25, which is line 112.

91
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:56,999
Here, now he's describing the situation.

92
00:12:56,999 --> 00:13:05,680
Here, from the inner wall, flames blast the ledge, while from the floor, an air blast bends them back, leaving one narrow path along the edge.

93
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,840
This path we were forced to take as best we might in single file.

94
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,040
And there I was, the flames to the left of me and the abyss to the right.

95
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:23,840
My leader said, that's Virgil, in this place it's clear we must all keep a tight rein on our eyes to take a false step will be easy here.

96
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,399
Well, that's the way.

97
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:36,480
That's the warning that Dante, in his relation to Beatrice, is also in danger of taking a false step.

98
00:13:36,479 --> 00:13:43,680
And he does go into the purifying flames.

99
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,279
There on page 266.

100
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,680
Don't know where I went, 266.

101
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,119
266.

102
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:57,519
Okay, the soul is asking Dante about line 64 on 266.

103
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,399
This is a different issue, but it's, remember we talked about Dante.

104
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,119
Oh, there are too many issues in my head now.

105
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:06,320
This is back.

106
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:21,119
Dante's in danger there, but the issue is also: remember that whether this is a poem for everybody, or is this a poem that is supposed to teach Dante something, edifying for him?

107
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:35,040
And I had the discussion with him about whether it's whether one finds oneself in the dark woods and it's a poem for everybody who gets lost sooner or later in their life, or whether it's specifically a poem about what Dante has to learn.

108
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,760
And it's somehow both, though it's hard to put them together.

109
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:44,560
But he explains here at the bottom of 266 that it's a poem for him.

110
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:52,599
The soul says, but now I pray, so it may seem, he's asking the soul to tell him what's going on.

111
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:56,599
He says, tell me that I may write down what you say for all to read.

112
00:14:57,239 --> 00:14:58,200
And who are you?

113
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,920
And so forth.

114
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,560
Now that sounds like the one, going for everybody to read.

115
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:13,960
And then at the bottom of the page, the shade says, Blessed are you who for a better life store in your soul experiences of these realms you travel through.

116
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:21,159
And there it looks like the important thing is that this is relevant to, I guess it's not too strange.

117
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,920
It's really what I've been saying.

118
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:29,560
I mean, he sees all of these punishments, but he gets specially involved in certain ones.

119
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:40,120
Seeing them all is the for everybody part, and getting involved in certain ones is ones that Dante has to get rid of in order to get to paradise.

120
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:41,960
So I think it could be both.

121
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,840
And so he's, and now we're in the part of it being directed toward him.

122
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:50,119
He has to go through these experiences.

123
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:54,839
Notice it's like Odyssey is saying he wants to get all the experiences.

124
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:59,399
But these aren't experiences of any old thing or any old world.

125
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:04,759
These are experiences that he has to go through so that he can lead a better life.

126
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,920
And then he does that.

127
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:10,039
Now, where are...

128
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,479
Now, that's fine.

129
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:14,039
So they have the brief kiss.

130
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:16,039
He's on his personal journey.

131
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:21,159
Oh, I'm going to talk about, yeah, I'm trying to keep track of these many things.

132
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:23,319
And how does he go through it?

133
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:27,840
Well, he goes actually into the flame.

134
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,119
Of all the punishments that he's almost fallen into.

135
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,320
He's never, as far as I can remember, suffered from any of them.

136
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:36,239
I mean, he fainted.

137
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:39,120
I guess I don't know if that's a kind of suffering or not.

138
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:47,920
But here, he's in big pain because he has to actually go through the purifying fires along with the lovers.

139
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,079
On the middle of 276, line 49.

140
00:16:52,079 --> 00:17:01,039
Once in the flame, I gladly would have cast my body into boiling glass to cool it against the measureless fury of the blast.

141
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:09,999
And so, in other words, he's going through a tiny bit of the kind of purifying fire that you have to get.

142
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:16,399
On 276, it's Canto 27, line 49.

143
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:22,239
It goes by rather fast because that's not what he's mainly interested in.

144
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:25,280
Okay, now that's all I have to say about the lovers.

145
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:47,600
If anybody has anything more to say about the lovers, you should say it now before I go on to the what is really the exciting, interesting thing for today, which you, the the good ones, the the brave and loyal ones who stayed even now, it's the mimical weather and the vacation so nearby and the podcast right outside get to get rewarded by this fascinating next episode.

146
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:57,999
And before we go on, uh, anybody I don't think there's anything to say about the Beatrice thing, but there is something to say about the stars, which I forgot to say.

147
00:17:57,999 --> 00:18:00,799
That's when I got noticed I does something wrong.

148
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,279
You might want to ask, well, these three stars, are they real stars?

149
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:12,319
And if so, what have they got to do with the Christian virtues and the four stars?

150
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:21,239
Or are they just allegorical stars, sort of, I don't know, like imaginary or something like painted scenery or something?

151
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:25,960
And the answer is supposed to be illuminating, namely, they are real stars.

152
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,720
They are in the southern hemisphere.

153
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:33,559
And you see them when you go down there and see the Mount of Purgatory.

154
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:36,840
And they shift around like stars do as the Earth turns.

155
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:38,999
I mean, Dante doesn't know as the Earth turns.

156
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:42,279
He thinks the stars are moving, but they move around in the sky.

157
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:46,360
But what's important is that it's hard to remember.

158
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:57,079
Those are real stars, and they really stand for the Christian virtues and the pagan virtues.

159
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:03,720
Pagan is, I keep wanting the right word for the Greeks, the antiquity virtue, the virtues of antiquity, maybe.

160
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:13,159
But in any case, and why can they both be real and mean something allegorical at the same time for Dante?

161
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:22,440
It's perfectly natural for him that they should be, that there should be such three bright stars and that they should shine on purgatory and so forth.

162
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:25,639
It's, you've got a cool?

163
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,920
You look like you're about to, you know?

164
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,800
Exactly.

165
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:32,680
I could see it in your eyes that you were about to say that.

166
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,039
Yes, exactly.

167
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,599
It's because it's the creation understanding of being.

168
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,960
Because everything in the universe is created by God.

169
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,839
And everything in the universe has a meaning.

170
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:49,159
And so that there are, whatever, there are planets.

171
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,479
I don't know.

172
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,479
I think there are many seven at that point.

173
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:53,400
That God is trying to tell you something.

174
00:19:53,400 --> 00:20:04,999
And when there are three stars that replace in the sky the four stars, or at least take more prominence depending on what's going on there, God is telling you something.

175
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:07,680
You've heard the phrase, the book of nature.

176
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,079
Well, God wrote the book of nature.

177
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,359
He made it all so that it meant something.

178
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,559
And people spend their time trying to read the book of nature.

179
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,280
I mentioned that once before, but I'm illustrating it now with the stars.

180
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:35,200
It's a very interesting frame of mind that everything that's there in nature is there to tell something important to human beings about their spiritual and ethical lives.

181
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,559
You can't, I mean, it's so far from our way of thinking, it's just hard to get into.

182
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:46,239
I don't suppose even the most religious Catholics believe it anymore.

183
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:47,760
Nobody can believe it anymore.

184
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:53,680
Modern science has just taken over and told us that it doesn't matter how many planets there are.

185
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,399
It's just a sheer, it's not a sheer accident.

186
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:03,119
It's a sheer result of some of the very complicated laws that were happening in the first nanoseconds of the Big Bang or something.

187
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,399
But it doesn't mean anything as far as advice of how to live a human life.

188
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:08,800
Yeah.

189
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,960
Well, man, what?

190
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:16,720
Oh, that's interesting.

191
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,079
That's the very important issue about evolution.

192
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,800
What he's saying is, but don't the Christians, and they do, still look at nature not as so much as beautiful.

193
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,559
That's the romantics, I think.

194
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:36,720
But having an intricacy, intelligent design, in effect, is the last remnant of Dante.

195
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:47,759
If there is intelligent design, then at least you can see that it's a created world and that there are signs of the Creator around, even though they're not to be read so literally as they once were.

196
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:57,640
And of course, the belief in evolution is the last nail in the coffin of that way of looking at things if you don't believe that way of looking at things.

197
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,120
And no wonder there's a big battle about evolution.

198
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,239
And I'm glad you brought it up.

199
00:22:01,239 --> 00:22:07,559
Yes, that's the last bit of the Dante view of the creation.

200
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,319
I mean, you can still be a Christian.

201
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:13,879
You can still be, you can even, you can certainly still believe in the creation.

202
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:24,039
And it's getting harder and harder and harder to think that you can read out of the creation sort of evidence of the motives and intelligence of the Creator.

203
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:24,920
Yeah.

204
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,279
Yeah, but don't talk about Kierkegaard here.

205
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:32,519
That's an ad for Philosophy VII.

206
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:37,639
Yes, Kierkegaard certainly understood, but I think probably people even before.

207
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:47,799
And in fact, Pascal already understood, that the world had become completely, and he thought, frighteningly, huge and meaningless.

208
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,400
That was Pascal before Newton, but he was after Galileo.

209
00:22:53,400 --> 00:23:02,119
So it was, and as soon as the new science came in, I mean, Galileo's big contribution was to get rid of teleology.

210
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,640
Nothing had any purpose.

211
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,239
Nothing had any meaning.

212
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:10,040
Everything was obeying the laws of physics, and the laws of physics were just facts.

213
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:14,440
They had no moral human significance.

214
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:20,200
And Pascal understood that in the 16, about the early 1700s.

215
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:20,759
Okay.

216
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:22,440
Now, I'm glad we had that discussion.

217
00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:24,200
That's interesting.

218
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,159
I hadn't heard thought about it what you brought up.

219
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,200
Okay, now.

220
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,680
Now we're going on, as I said, to the fun part.

221
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:43,440
The whole poem was written to get us to say something about Beatrice that nobody has ever said about their girlfriend before.

222
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:51,119
Write a poem, a love poem that was a greater love poem than anybody had ever written before.

223
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,479
And now we're going to see how Dante brings that off in a complicated way.

224
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:09,119
So you skip to Canto 29, and there you get this big pageant, the sort of parade that Dante sees at the top of purgatory.

225
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:15,119
And there, on 292, Chiardi sums it up.

226
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,879
When Chiardi is just sort of summarizing, you can trust him.

227
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,960
And he's not making any interpretation.

228
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,479
You just read all the stuff in capital letters.

229
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:26,160
There's a heavenly pageant.

230
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,400
There are these golden candlesticks.

231
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,680
There's a rainbow.

232
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,079
That's not so important as there are 24 books of the Old Testament.

233
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:38,559
There's the four beasts which represent the four gospels.

234
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:43,519
There's a triumphal chariot, which is the church drawn by a griffon.

235
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:45,519
That's one of the interesting characters.

236
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:57,440
Turns out to be a symbol for Jesus because the griffon is supposed to have two natures, a supernatural nature and an animal nature at the same time, I guess.

237
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,039
I don't know much, don't know much about anything about the griffon except what Chiardi says.

238
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,319
I wouldn't trust that.

239
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:07,920
But he is certainly a symbol of the incarnation, and Dante makes that clear.

240
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,599
And then there are the three theological virtues.

241
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,239
Those are now the same as the three stars, that there's faith, hope, and love again.

242
00:25:16,239 --> 00:25:19,759
And it's the left wheel of the chariot, the four cardinal virtues.

243
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:21,239
And I worry about that.

244
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:23,960
I mean, I'm sure it's worse to be on the left than to be on the right.

245
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,680
It always is.

246
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:29,639
The right has got to do with what's right, and the left has always got to do with what's wrong.

247
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:37,239
But how wrong, and why they're there at all, dancing in this Christian parade, I'm very worried about.

248
00:25:37,239 --> 00:25:40,039
But anyway, that whole parade goes by.

249
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:51,639
I wouldn't bother to tell you, except that it's very important, and it's going to play a crucial role in what's going to happen next.

250
00:25:51,640 --> 00:26:15,559
By the way, the Griffin I've written here, it's Dante who tells us on page, in Canto 31, page 313, line 79, he says that beast, I just want to read just line 80 and 81, that beast, that's the griffon, which is one person in two natures.

251
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:20,840
Well, that's God, one person in two natures, God the Father and God the Son.

252
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:27,399
He's got a Holy Spirit in there, too, but that's not relevant for the incarnation, is what we're busy talking about.

253
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:37,319
So, and now all of this goes by, and then it stops in front of Dante, the procession.

254
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:46,359
Sort of the history of Christianity, the history, in fact, the history of the Judeo-Christian, because the Old Testament 24 books are in there too.

255
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:56,039
The whole history of the Judeo-Christian religion in the West is going by, and it all stops right in front of Dante.

256
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:02,279
It has something special to do with this version with Dante.

257
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:15,440
And then the most weird part of all, weird in a sense I can't quite explain yet, is the angels are flying over the Griffin is pulling the chariot.

258
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,159
The chariot is the symbol of the church.

259
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:24,960
And inside the chariot, there's something or somebody, and we don't know what it is yet because it's covered up.

260
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:33,120
But whatever it is, the angels fly over and singing, line 19, Benedictus Tivenis.

261
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:41,680
I don't know how to, my Latin isn't any good, but I know that that translation of that is, Blessed is he who comes.

262
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:50,239
Now, that sounds, who would you expect in the middle of Christian history, in what the Christians call the fullness of time?

263
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:52,479
Jesus came in the fullness of time.

264
00:27:52,799 --> 00:28:00,239
In the middle of Christian history, which is the parade, there is somebody who arrives.

265
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:03,279
With the angels singing, blessed is he who arrives.

266
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,119
Well, who could that be?

267
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:05,760
Come on.

268
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,360
Yeah, you know.

269
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,880
Jesus, of course.

270
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,680
It must be.

271
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,039
I mean, it couldn't, what else could it possibly be?

272
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,639
And yet, of course, it isn't.

273
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:40,239
Going down further on the page, there was, so as if the sun was getting rid of the vapors on line two, on page 303, line 25, he began to see within clouds of flowers that rose like fountains from the angels' hands.

274
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:46,079
This is quite a stupor parade, and fell upon the chariot, a lady came into view.

275
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:47,759
That is too much.

276
00:28:47,759 --> 00:29:00,519
I mean, even with the angels singing, Blessed is he who comes, in the middle of the parade, and in the place of Jesus, in the church, pulled by the griffin, who should show up but a lady.

277
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:07,400
And that's the amazing gizmo that Dante has built into the poem.

278
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,039
We're now in line 31.

279
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:17,080
The lady came into view, and then she's got an olive crown, and that's not important, and so forth.

280
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:21,159
What's important is Dante's reaction, starting in 34.

281
00:29:21,479 --> 00:29:39,640
My soul, such years had passed since it saw that lady and stood trembling in her presence, stupefied by the power of holy awe, now by some power that shone from her above the reach and witness of my mortal eyes, felt the full mastery of ancient love, I think.

282
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,799
I don't think, I'm not sure.

283
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:43,720
We need to know about the Italian.

284
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,319
Beatrice and I are going to study the Italian or Vitation, and we'll tell you the answer.

285
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,440
That's one of the issues.

286
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,600
I just don't know what kind of love it's supposed to be.

287
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:55,079
I'm sure that whatever it is, it doesn't matter for the interpretation.

288
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:58,200
It's his super kind of love.

289
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:04,759
I mean, I think what you would write in there, though Dante would never write it in because he doesn't know the name for it yet, is romantic love.

290
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:06,840
The full mastery of romantic love.

291
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,440
That's what he's really saying.

292
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:14,839
This chivalric knight for his lady, super adoration kind of love.

293
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:17,879
It's something that's been invented by the Troubadours.

294
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,080
There's no precedent.

295
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:22,039
There's no other culture that has romantic love.

296
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:27,799
And our culture didn't have romantic love either until the Troubadours came along.

297
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:48,319
I mean, Odysseus certainly was eager and happy to get back to Penelope, but it isn't as if he adored Penelope so that if she died or went away, his whole world would collapse or that he could spend his whole life devoted to writing poems or anything else for Penelope.

298
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:49,599
That just wouldn't make any sense.

299
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,680
The Greeks would think other craziness.

300
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:58,399
So here it is, this new thing that Dante is claiming for his, this kind of romantic love.

301
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:05,440
The instant I was smitten by the force which had already once transfixed my soul before my boyhood years had run their course.

302
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,720
Remember, he was 14 when he saw her.

303
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:14,559
And then comes the amazing fastest moves at the top of 304.

304
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:36,239
Then Dante is really, when Dante is talking about romantic love and his love of Beatrice, then he's totally clear and utterly unconfused about what articulation, what he thinks the moral of Christianity is, when Jesus presumably says, love is your commandment, and it's the only commandment.

305
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:42,799
Dante doesn't seem to think it's agape, that you should go around being generous in giving things.

306
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:49,119
He doesn't seem to think it's eros that you should desire something, although he certainly desires Beatrice.

307
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,440
It's a lot more than desire.

308
00:31:51,759 --> 00:32:00,720
But he does think that this is the kind of love that the whole Christianity is built around.

309
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,280
And at this, when he's inside the Beatrice story, then when he gets outside the Beatrice story, he gets sort of taken over by St.

310
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:12,239
Thomas, and that makes it harder, very hard to keep track of what's going on.

311
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:14,559
But we're right in the middle of the best part.

312
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,119
So, see, I turned left.

313
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:29,319
I'm at the top of 304 with the same assured belief that makes a child run to its mother's arms when it is frightened or has come to grief, to say to Virgil, there is not within me one drop of blood unstirred.

314
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:32,440
I recognize the tokens of the ancient flame.

315
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,799
That's my favorite line in the divine comedy.

316
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:37,879
And it's in quotes.

317
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,320
Why is it in quotes?

318
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:42,680
I think I've already said this, but I want to, does anybody remember?

319
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:44,599
Who's he quoting?

320
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:53,879
Well, he's quoting Beat, he's quoting Dido, saying what she felt when she saw Aeneas.

321
00:32:53,880 --> 00:33:03,799
He's reading romantic love back into the Dido story, or maybe not that, but maybe I don't know whether he thinks Dido had this love for Aeneas.

322
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:04,839
Probably he doesn't.

323
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:26,759
But what he's doing is saying whatever it meant to her, to him it means that he feels completely overwhelmed by this mixture of physical and spiritual love, this somehow mixture of, which is Neros and isn't agape, which is this polar adoration, period.

324
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:33,239
And you might want to know, and I better stop and tell you, why does this have anything to do with Christianity at all?

325
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:44,920
Is it just a coincidence that it's the same culture, namely Judeo-Christian Western culture, which also invented and believed in romantic love up to very recently?

326
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:54,360
I have a feeling maybe not anymore, but certainly up to, I don't know, my parents' generation.

327
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:57,640
I guess maybe even, yeah, maybe my daughter still does.

328
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,279
Okay, yes.

329
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:00,680
Anyway, invented romantic love.

330
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,440
And why?

331
00:34:02,439 --> 00:34:05,000
What's it got to do with the Gospels?

332
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,720
Well, I don't know.

333
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,039
I mean, I would like to see somebody write a book about this.

334
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,040
There are probably dozens of books about this, but nobody's ever told me which to read.

335
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:30,080
But to make up a story myself, I say, well, Jesus says to the disciples that they should be ready to die for each other or for him, and that he's ready to die for them.

336
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,920
But also important, nobody's supposed to kill anybody.

337
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:41,120
Remember, Peter has to put up his sword when he tries to defend Jesus by killing the Roman soldiers when they're coming.

338
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:52,879
So the idea that there should be somebody that you are willing to die for, but not to kill for, that's in the Bible.

339
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,560
That's in the New Testament.

340
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:05,759
And then the Troubadours just elaborate on it and make that somebody the lady and make the person committed to them the knight whose lady that is.

341
00:35:05,759 --> 00:35:08,640
And chivalric love grows out of that.

342
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:19,279
And then romantic love is kind of the bourgeois secular version of that kind of aristocratic love that the Troubadours had.

343
00:35:19,279 --> 00:35:22,080
And so Dante is inheriting all that.

344
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:31,120
And he's, he would claim, it makes a very tiny part of the Gospels very, very important.

345
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:38,399
But after all, Jesus said the main important commandment was love, and Paul said that the main virtue was love.

346
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:50,479
It's just that what they've done is switch, what Dante's done is switched around the notion of love from this agape-giving kind of love to a total commitment kind of love.

347
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:59,720
And you can see why there's a reason to see that, because Jesus does talk about how he's committed to the disciples and they're committed to him, clung to death.

348
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,800
And there you get it.

349
00:36:01,799 --> 00:36:10,520
So there, and now, and what's happening here, why is it interesting and important that he's quoting Virgil?

350
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:22,440
Well, I brought along the Virgil, but in our version, you can't tell very much that it's the same words, but it's on 82.

351
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,279
No, wait a minute.

352
00:36:24,279 --> 00:36:24,919
Where am I?

353
00:36:25,399 --> 00:36:27,319
Oh, what I've got the wrong thing here.

354
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:28,119
Let's try again.

355
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,239
I'm running along the Aeneid on page 82.

356
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:37,399
She's talking about how her husband died, and now Aeneas is the only man.

357
00:36:37,399 --> 00:36:42,200
She's telling her sister, I think it's her sister she's talking to, three lines down on 82.

358
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,440
Aeneas is the only man to move my feelings, to overturn my shifting heart.

359
00:36:46,439 --> 00:36:49,400
I know too well the signs of the old flame.

360
00:36:49,399 --> 00:36:54,439
That's what Dante is saying when he's saying, I recognize the tokens of the ancient flame.

361
00:36:54,439 --> 00:36:56,840
He's quoting that exactly.

362
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:59,640
And what does it do, to quote that exactly?

363
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:15,400
Well, it turns the relation of Virgil to Dante sort of inside out or upside down or something, because Virgil, when Dido says that, that's the beginning of the end for Dido.

364
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:37,759
She's falling in love with Aeneas by being shot by Cupid and has this arrow hanging out of her side, and she's becoming, she gets more and more frantic and runs around foaming at the mouth, and she gets, and this, and the flame finally turns into the funeral pyre that kills, and it's a disease, and finally she burns up.

365
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:51,839
There's nothing more disastrous than this kind of romantic mixture of sensual and spiritual passion that she has for Aninas.

366
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:58,720
So it isn't as if sort of romantic love or some kind of romantic passion didn't exist.

367
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,720
Virgil could picture it.

368
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,759
It's just that he thought it was a disease, an awful thing.

369
00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:13,360
The interesting thing in Dante is not only does it exist, but it's the highest thing that human beings, the most positive thing that human beings could possibly experience.

370
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:24,480
So he just takes over the Virgil description and applies it to his romantic, chivalric devotion to Beatrice.

371
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,679
And what effect does that have on Virgil?

372
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,119
Next question.

373
00:38:29,439 --> 00:38:30,880
Done the reading?

374
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,200
What happens to Virgil?

375
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,880
You look like you know.

376
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:35,759
He leaves.

377
00:38:35,759 --> 00:38:38,079
He vanishes like in a puff of smoke.

378
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,920
He doesn't even say goodbye.

379
00:38:39,919 --> 00:38:41,359
He's just gone.

380
00:38:41,359 --> 00:39:02,479
And the next sentence, he says this, he turns to Virgil, and in a funny frame of mind, I don't know what he's thinking, quotes this line, which in Virgil means disaster as the most exciting good thing that's happening, and Virgil can't take it, that he had taken, that he had taken his life from us, that has disappeared.

381
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,279
He had gone.

382
00:39:03,279 --> 00:39:04,399
Virgil had gone.

383
00:39:04,399 --> 00:39:09,120
Virgil, the gentle father, to whom I gave my soul for its salvation.

384
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,959
Well, that's a bit of an exaggeration.

385
00:39:10,959 --> 00:39:17,520
He never gave his soul for his salvation to anybody but one person, of course.

386
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,720
Beatrice.

387
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,599
Beatrice.

388
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,999
He has really given his soul for his salvation to Beatrice.

389
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:24,279
She's his savior.

390
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:32,279
Exactly in what way she's his savior, and you could put it more strongly, she's the savior to him.

391
00:39:32,279 --> 00:39:35,879
That is, there's this is the crucial, interesting thing.

392
00:39:35,879 --> 00:39:39,880
Dante never relates to Jesus as the savior.

393
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,000
Jesus doesn't even show up in the divine comedy.

394
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,200
And that's because Beatrice has taken the place of Jesus.

395
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,720
That's what we just were talking about.

396
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:53,800
That's why she's standing in the chariot in the middle of the procession, which is the history of the church.

397
00:39:53,799 --> 00:39:58,200
And she is Jesus in Dante's life.

398
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:11,640
She isn't your Savior or my Savior, but each of us, if we are to be saved, will have to be saved by finding somebody to love with this romantic, total adoration.

399
00:40:11,959 --> 00:40:15,800
Why do you have to do that in order to be saved?

400
00:40:15,799 --> 00:40:22,519
Well, that's where things get complicated, but I'm not sure I'm ready to do it yet.

401
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:35,239
So Dante has now written a poem about his girlfriend like nobody ever did before, saying his girlfriend was in effect God and the Savior, his Savior.

402
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:43,400
And in case you missed it, he is, for Dante, the incarnation.

403
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,960
Dante tells you so.

404
00:40:46,279 --> 00:40:49,479
Let me see, though, catching up where I am.

405
00:40:49,799 --> 00:40:50,359
Okay.

406
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:52,759
Yeah?

407
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,439
So Virgil vanishes.

408
00:40:54,439 --> 00:40:55,800
I'm just catching up.

409
00:40:55,799 --> 00:40:59,960
Well, no, yeah, now I want to say something here or later.

410
00:41:00,279 --> 00:41:02,520
Well, let me finish what I'm saying now.

411
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,960
Proving that Dante doesn't want you to miss that she's the incarnation.

412
00:41:07,279 --> 00:41:20,000
He looks into her eyes, and in her eyes, he sees the griffon, which was, remember, which is the symbol of the incarnation.

413
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,320
So let's look on 296.

414
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:25,759
Well, there was the gripon on 296, but now that's not going to do any good.

415
00:41:25,759 --> 00:41:27,919
Let's go on to 300.

416
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:38,639
Now, 300, we have Chiardi telling us, in footnote, that the church is represented as a chariot, and that's fine.

417
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,560
We don't deny that.

418
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,960
And now, where is Beatrice looking?

419
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:44,880
Now, here we are.

420
00:41:44,879 --> 00:41:46,479
On 330.

421
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,160
I have to jump way ahead, but I want to finish my story.

422
00:41:50,399 --> 00:41:58,800
Lest you think that Dante doesn't know that he's putting Beatrice in the place of Jesus, you can see it very clearly.

423
00:41:58,799 --> 00:42:06,160
One, he gives her Jesus' words to say at the top of 330.

424
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,880
He says a whole bunch of Latin, I guess that's Latin, right?

425
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:19,600
And what it means is she's quoting, she's quoting, she's channeling Jesus in a sense.

426
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,959
He says in the Gospels, not the one we read, I don't think.

427
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:24,319
Does he say it in ours?

428
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:29,759
That for a while you've seen me, but then for a while you won't see me, and then you will see me again.

429
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,640
Is that what that says?

430
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,599
That's what that says.

431
00:42:31,759 --> 00:42:32,879
Does he say that at the end?

432
00:42:32,879 --> 00:42:40,000
It may be that there's a page missing from the end of the Gospel of John that I passed out to everybody, and it may be that he says it there.

433
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,920
In any case, those are Jesus's words, and she says them.

434
00:42:43,919 --> 00:42:46,239
But that's not the clincher.

435
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:49,839
And the clincher, I'm beginning to not understand where it is.

436
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,559
It isn't where I say it is.

437
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,239
That's a little alarming.

438
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,079
So now I have to find it.

439
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:56,359
You have to help me find it.

440
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:04,279
Somewhere we understand what happens when he looks into her eyes, what he sees.

441
00:43:04,279 --> 00:43:05,319
Aha.

442
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:06,599
No?

443
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,720
Well, keep looking.

444
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,080
Somewhere earlier.

445
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,120
Hmm.

446
00:43:10,439 --> 00:43:13,640
So he's got to look into her eyes.

447
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,160
You find it, yeah.

448
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:23,160
Funny, I wrote down the page number on, but it's so clearly there that we just have to wait till we find it because it's crucial.

449
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:28,759
He looks into her eyes, and he sees the griffon in her eyes.

450
00:43:28,759 --> 00:43:31,159
Ah, here we are, at the top of 314.

451
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:37,960
They say, line, we're now in Canto 31, line 115.

452
00:43:38,279 --> 00:43:45,000
The angels are singing, Look deep, look well, however your eyes may smart.

453
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,319
We have led you now before those emeralds.

454
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:48,519
That's her green eyes.

455
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,160
That was the thing that most attracted him, he says.

456
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,279
We'll get back to that.

457
00:43:52,279 --> 00:43:55,239
From which love shot his arrows through your heart.

458
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:57,560
So he's taken over Cupid's arrows.

459
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,759
These are little things on the side, but I have to say them when I see them.

460
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:07,720
Whereas the arrow was part of the bad thing that happened to poor Dido when she got shot by Cupid's arrow.

461
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,519
It was no fun.

462
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,600
It was being like a wounded animal.

463
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:22,279
But now those green eyes, which were the first thing, now I have to prove that, the first thing about Beatrice that attracted him when he was young, where is that earlier?

464
00:44:22,279 --> 00:44:23,879
So now we've got to find the green eyes.

465
00:44:23,879 --> 00:44:25,960
Boys, it's a struggle.

466
00:44:25,959 --> 00:44:27,239
Well, I don't see it.

467
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:28,759
Now I'm worried about that.

468
00:44:28,759 --> 00:44:30,119
Oh, yeah, well, but it's right.

469
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,720
But I was just reading.

470
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:32,519
I see.

471
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,320
Yes.

472
00:44:33,319 --> 00:44:33,879
Okay.

473
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,919
It's right in front of me.

474
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:39,839
So look deep into those emeralds from which love shot his arrows through your heart.

475
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:45,039
That means it was the sight of her green eyes that first grabbed him.

476
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,800
We'll see more about that in a little while.

477
00:44:46,799 --> 00:44:50,879
So a thousand burning passions, everyone hotter than flame.

478
00:44:50,879 --> 00:44:56,959
I mean, there's no question that there's a sensual embodied side to this love.

479
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,839
And there ought to be.

480
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:03,279
I mean, this is a religion about incarnation, about the spirit becoming flesh.

481
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:08,880
And so it's her body, in this case, her eyes, that he's fixed on.

482
00:45:08,879 --> 00:45:11,919
And now comes the interesting part about the incarnation.

483
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:21,600
These eyes, these passions, hotter than flames, held my eyes fixed to the loosened eyes she held fixed on the griffon.

484
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:29,440
And like sunlight in a glass, the twofold creature shone from the deep reflection over her eyes, now in one, now in the other, nature.

485
00:45:29,439 --> 00:45:35,999
So he sees in the griffon the man side and the God side of Jesus.

486
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,640
He doesn't actually see Jesus because, as I say, she's Jesus.

487
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,320
But he sees that.

488
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:43,919
And that's what...

489
00:45:43,919 --> 00:45:45,919
And why did I have the wrong page?

490
00:45:45,919 --> 00:45:47,520
Anyway, let me fix it.

491
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,960
So I'm back to the incarnation now.

492
00:45:50,959 --> 00:45:56,640
She's an incarnation, presumably, of God.

493
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,600
She's his God.

494
00:45:57,759 --> 00:45:59,920
She incarnates God for him.

495
00:45:59,919 --> 00:46:02,799
That is, when he looks into, how did I put it?

496
00:46:02,799 --> 00:46:05,120
I had a good way of putting it just a second.

497
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,080
Now I'm back to worrying about where's the griffon again.

498
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,920
Ah yeah, okay, here we are.

499
00:46:10,879 --> 00:46:15,920
So the griffon pulls the cart, which is the church.

500
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:17,840
And that's right.

501
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,640
And Beatrice is the incarnation.

502
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:25,800
I have to find the right way I want to say it.

503
00:46:26,759 --> 00:46:35,560
So Beatrice looks off the incarnation, the griffon, and Dante is seeing the incarnation reflected in Beatrice's eyes.

504
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,439
That's a way of saying she's the incarnation.

505
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:44,599
It's through Beatrice that he sees, and when he sees Beatrice, he sees the incarnation.

506
00:46:44,919 --> 00:46:47,239
And again, it's all there is to see, you would think.

507
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:49,160
You don't have to actually see Jesus.

508
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,160
You don't actually have to see the Father.

509
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:56,440
You've seen all you need to see if you've just seen Beatrice's green eyes, he seems to be saying.

510
00:46:56,439 --> 00:47:04,200
And I think that's what he really wants to say, but I don't think he quite dares to say it or thinks it through.

511
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,360
But let me go back now a little because I jumped ahead.

512
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:11,160
So there's the chariot, time stops.

513
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,439
The lady comes out.

514
00:47:12,439 --> 00:47:14,359
I have to find out where I am.

515
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,319
Oh, yeah.

516
00:47:15,319 --> 00:47:21,239
We have to go back and just make sure that we understand that it's Beatrice's body which attracts him.

517
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:26,200
And it's because she has a body that he sees in her, the incarnation.

518
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:42,359
And we've got that on page 314, sort of funny, if you want to say so, because he starts by looking at her eyes, and they're the things that grabbed him first and kept him.

519
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:55,800
But if you go back to 312, she says on line 49, nothing in art or nature could call forth such joy from you as the sight of that fair body.

520
00:47:55,799 --> 00:47:57,880
Well, I was curious about that.

521
00:47:57,879 --> 00:47:59,799
I wondered what that really meant.

522
00:47:59,799 --> 00:48:02,840
You get in other translations, you get fair limbs.

523
00:48:02,839 --> 00:48:07,440
So it was the sight of her legs or fair members in another translation.

524
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:10,319
I mean, I think the sensiblest thing is legs, but I don't know.

525
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:14,400
But anyway, that also attracted him.

526
00:48:14,399 --> 00:48:20,720
But then there is, where is the place where they go on about her mouth, which is something very important, too.

527
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,600
Now I've lost 314 again?

528
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,480
Where?

529
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,479
Oh, I see.

530
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,279
Yes, yes.

531
00:48:29,279 --> 00:48:42,800
Okay, so now we've got her eyes and her legs, and out the bottom of 314, grant us this favor of your grace, reveal your mouth to him, and let his eyes behold that second beauty, which your veil conceals.

532
00:48:42,799 --> 00:48:44,639
So those are the three beauties.

533
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,160
His eyes, her mouth, her limbs, or whatever.

534
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:54,880
And that's all completely embodied as it should be.

535
00:48:54,879 --> 00:49:04,799
Now, but scary, because it's getting more and more hard to tell why Dante is here and not in hell.

536
00:49:04,879 --> 00:49:06,400
Sounds like a poem.

537
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:16,879
And because it sounds very much like the Paola-Francesca adoration couple.

538
00:49:17,279 --> 00:49:20,799
And they also, I mean, why not?

539
00:49:20,799 --> 00:49:26,239
That's again a case of total sensual romantic love.

540
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,880
And, well, we've got to figure out, sort that out.

541
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:32,160
Oh, but I forgot something else.

542
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,919
There are too many different things planned.

543
00:49:33,919 --> 00:49:38,320
I wanted to say she is the incarnation for Dante, all right.

544
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:42,800
And it's through her that he understands the incarnation.

545
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,040
But the incarnation is Jesus.

546
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,879
Why is he the incarnation?

547
00:49:48,879 --> 00:49:59,480
Well, I take it, I mean, I'm not, Dante doesn't say this, but I'm saying what's what Dante must think is he understands that Beatrice didn't come and save the world.

548
00:50:00,359 --> 00:50:11,000
Jesus came to save the world because Jesus first showed what it was to be incarnate, totally spiritual and total flesh at the same time.

549
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:19,960
Jesus also introduced this kind of love, which for the time it gets to Dante is romantic adoration.

550
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:28,600
And he did think that the apostles could adore him, that the disciples could adore him.

551
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:41,320
Anyway, so, but therefore, Jesus brings the very notion of incarnation and that you get saved by adoring another embodied being into the world.

552
00:50:41,319 --> 00:50:45,560
And that makes him a big deal, the incarnation.

553
00:50:46,040 --> 00:51:02,440
But then, once he's done it, and after a little bit of articulating, a lot of articulating, and finally the troubadour articulating and so forth, then it comes out that thanks to Jesus, everybody could have their own incarnation.

554
00:51:02,439 --> 00:51:16,840
That is, Dante's got Beatrice, and every other person could have their own Savior, their own being for whom they had total devotion and commitment.

555
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,720
That's how it works out in Dante.

556
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,559
So, let me see now where we are.

557
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:24,520
So, the point is to have total devotion.

558
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,359
Now, why is it so important?

559
00:51:26,359 --> 00:51:30,919
Why is it necessary for Beatrice to save Dante?

560
00:51:30,919 --> 00:51:32,759
And how does she save Dante?

561
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,000
He doesn't seem very saved yet.

562
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:46,640
Well, the first thing you've got to do is soup up your love to total devotion so that nothing in the world can satisfy it.

563
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,920
That's the next move.

564
00:51:47,919 --> 00:51:52,160
You'd think that Beatrice had satisfied it, but that's not how Dante wants it to go.

565
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,759
So let me get us straight here.

566
00:51:53,759 --> 00:51:55,599
So she's in the place of Jesus.

567
00:51:55,600 --> 00:52:00,479
She's the Savior, total love, combining the spiritual and the physical.

568
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:15,600
She soups up his capacity to love so that, and now comes the move which I don't like, but it's very medieval and not very early Christian, I think.

569
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:21,759
Anyway, there's nothing, finally, he loves Beatrice so much that even she can't really satisfy him.

570
00:52:21,759 --> 00:52:24,320
A very weird, hard thing to understand.

571
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:28,800
But there's nothing in the world that can satisfy him.

572
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:38,560
And he, in the end, you'll see in the Paradiso, sort of sends him off, so to speak, to contemplate God.

573
00:52:38,879 --> 00:52:47,520
And so Beatrice turns out, and Jesus turns out, on Dante's view, to be the way but not the truth.

574
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:53,040
To talk, I mean, you're sort of, I think he's sort of deviating from the Gospel of John.

575
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,080
What is it for Beatrice to be the way and not the truth?

576
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,000
She leads him to God.

577
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:08,160
She soups up his love to such an extent of complete adoration that she's not able to completely fulfill it.

578
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:15,360
And then she transfers him to God, who is the only being, the supreme being, that can fulfill it.

579
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,960
And that means she was the way to the truth.

580
00:53:18,959 --> 00:53:23,480
The truth being the contemplation of the highest reality.

581
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,440
I take it that's how Dante thinks of it.

582
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:32,759
On 3.11, he talks about it in ways that are somewhat hard to figure out.

583
00:53:33,399 --> 00:53:34,839
I'll tell you what I think.

584
00:53:34,839 --> 00:53:54,040
On 3.11, which is Canto 31, line 22, she says, filled as you were with the desire I taught you for that good, without any capital letters, and for that good beyond which nothing exists on earth to which man may aspire.

585
00:53:54,040 --> 00:54:09,399
That is, you're going to fill with a desire for a good which so supreme, I think that's God, only called Aristotelian, beyond which nothing exists on earth which man can aspire.

586
00:54:09,399 --> 00:54:14,279
And then what yawning mode, Sephard to abandon all hope.

587
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:19,559
So she, I think, she sets him up with a desire that only God can satisfy.

588
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,200
I think that's what that is trying to say.

589
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,040
Now, and then what?

590
00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:30,920
Well, for one thing, Chiardi panics at this point.

591
00:54:30,919 --> 00:54:37,480
And I think it's sort of funny what Chiardi's always having these sort of Puritan reactions.

592
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:53,960
This idea that Dante's total physical romantic love for Beatrice is how every soul relates to Jesus and how Jesus is the way for everyone to get to God.

593
00:54:54,839 --> 00:55:09,279
When Chiardi thinks about it, on 317, the middle of the page in the notes, just to note, note that Dante doesn't achieve his revelation by looking at the griffon itself, but by looking at its reflection in the eyes of Beatrice.

594
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:12,239
And what, in parentheses, as the church.

595
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,079
So he's turned.

596
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:19,520
Chiardi can't imagine that Dante could have this complete, I mean, how can Chiardi be meaning this?

597
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:27,120
But he can't imagine that Dante is having this sort of physical, romantic, flaming love for Beatrice.

598
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:41,519
And since Beatrice is in that chariot that's being pulled in the procession, which is the church, he thinks that somehow, if he can think at all, that Beatrice is the church.

599
00:55:41,759 --> 00:55:43,279
Beatrice isn't the heart.

600
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:48,160
Beatrice is the person in the cart, and she's not the church.

601
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,079
If she's anything, she's Jesus.

602
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,720
I mean, she's Dante's Savior.

603
00:55:53,040 --> 00:56:04,480
And now, and so, and now his love for Beatrice gets souped up, and he sees the incarnation.

604
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,400
I'm getting to where we were.

605
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:12,960
And then Dante will get to the truth, will get to God thanks to her.

606
00:56:13,759 --> 00:56:22,640
And now she makes this speech on page 312, which has the fair body part in it, but it has something else in it.

607
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,800
The reason she's talking about the fair body is further interesting.

608
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:41,279
She says on 49, 312, nothing in art or nature could call forth such joy for you as the sight of that fair body, which clothed me once, and now shifts back to earth.

609
00:56:41,279 --> 00:56:56,120
Now, at this point, Dante really starts getting caught in the crossfire of articulation, because he's got this beautiful Dante story, that romantic love is what saves people.

610
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:01,320
And then it's embodied, focused on one fair body and so forth.

611
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:06,200
And now it turns out it's very important that we've got to get rid of Beatrice's body.

612
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,399
She already would like that.

613
00:57:07,399 --> 00:57:08,520
So it goes on.

614
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:19,239
She says, and if my dying turned that highest pleasure, that is her body, to very dust, what joy could still remain in mortal things for you to seek and treasure?

615
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:31,320
That the first blow you took from such vain things, your every thought, the first blow you took from such vain things, your every thought should have been raised to follow my flight above decay.

616
00:57:31,319 --> 00:57:41,559
That you should have remained faithful to really something like the meaning of our love, not the actual embodiment of our love.

617
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:47,799
How could you get hooked on the embodiment of my love and then when I died, think that somehow it was over?

618
00:57:47,799 --> 00:57:50,120
But that's what happened, or it seemed to happen.

619
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,999
He went through a period in which he lost touch with Beatrice.

620
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,080
That's why he was in the dark woods.

621
00:57:56,120 --> 00:58:01,079
Nor should your wings have been weighted down by any joy below, love of a maid.

622
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:11,640
She's angry because he seems to have had some affair with some other woman or any other fleeting and useless thing to wait a second blow.

623
00:58:12,359 --> 00:58:14,599
If you love this maid, she would have died.

624
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:22,360
So since people die, you shouldn't have this unconditional admiration of the whole embodied person.

625
00:58:22,359 --> 00:58:25,479
It's again to say the truth doesn't go away, Story.

626
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:30,840
I mean, it's fine to get your love souped up toward an embodied other person.

627
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:57,840
But if you're asking for trouble, if you really make the meaning of your life depend on the other embodied person, and Dante is slipping into some kind of Stoic view, some kind of Greek view, not Homeric, Plato and Aristotle kind of view, where only if you could relate, I mean, he's really, I think, not Stoic, I take that back, because that would say love less.

628
00:58:57,839 --> 00:58:59,599
That's certainly not the idea.

629
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:10,080
It's not that she's supposed to soup up your love, and you're not supposed to love less, but you're supposed to transfer that love to first to the meaning of the love.

630
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:15,680
You could get your whole meaning of your life by having had this relation to Beatrice.

631
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,600
That's what you should have remembered.

632
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:30,800
And then you could transfer that disembodied meaning of the love to a direct experience of God, who is altogether disembodied, and you'll see in the Paradiso.

633
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:32,959
And that's now where are we?

634
00:59:32,959 --> 00:59:39,999
I mean, if you get to that, it's very confusing and I think sort of depressing to me, because Dante seems to have blown it.

635
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:57,600
I mean, he's made Beatrice the central Jesus figure, Savior figure in his life, but then he's sort of thrown Jesus and Savior figure into the business of being the way to another truth, which is disembodied and pure spiritual and so forth.

636
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:04,480
That doesn't seem to have gotten the message of the troubadours in the New Testament right.

637
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,319
But it's the message of St.

638
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:20,080
Thomas, and there's always this Greek articulation running crash into the Christian articulation, my Christian articulation, and I think Dante's experience.

639
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:23,000
And this isn't back to the three stars and the four stars.

640
01:00:20,399 --> 01:00:34,600
I mean, he doesn't see that the faith, hope, and love, which he's interpreting in his romantic love of Beatrice, has replaced and trumped the other stars.

641
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:41,640
And all the whole wisdom of antiquity is wrong.

642
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:45,400
It can't be a step to something else.

643
01:00:45,399 --> 01:00:46,279
It's just wrong.

644
01:00:46,279 --> 01:00:47,560
It's a dead end.

645
01:00:47,799 --> 01:00:50,680
Because it says you should have temperance.

646
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,519
You should cut down your love.

647
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:54,519
That's a dead end.

648
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:07,159
If in a created universe in which there is God who is able to satisfy the most extreme desire, then it's just wrong to cut down your love.

649
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:11,480
And it's wrong to, and now that's a different point.

650
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:16,599
And it looks like somebody embodied could satisfy all your love.

651
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,920
That's what Jesus seemed to be showing.

652
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:31,400
He didn't remember he who's seen me has seen the Father, and he meant me incarnate, and the word made flesh, but now the flesh is being dropped.

653
01:01:31,399 --> 01:01:33,640
And that's what's happening here.

654
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:46,200
I can't say anything about it except that it's inevitable, that it's just too hard and too premature for Dante's really interesting vision to work.

655
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:51,479
Now, I would say maybe he's afraid of the church because he's afraid, I mean, the church would be like Chiari.

656
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:54,200
They'd be very upset about all this if they understood it.

657
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,039
But I don't think Dante's afraid of the church.

658
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,960
I don't think Dante's afraid of anything.

659
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:06,800
And there's plenty of heresies in here, including, I told you, the present Pope being in hell and some sort of virtual Pope being on the throne.

660
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:11,279
I don't think Dante really is going to let that intimidate him.

661
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:17,279
I think it's more that he's fallen under the influence of St.

662
01:02:17,279 --> 01:02:18,160
Thomas, that's all.

663
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:25,199
That the reigning articulation is an articulation which is really not a good articulation.

664
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,560
It's just underlining what it's trying to articulate.

665
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:47,599
And Dante's caught between the really deep sense, thanks to the troubadour, of some new kind of love, new kind of relation to God, and the old Platonic Aristotelian model being recycled and trying to get to put this Christian experience into it.

666
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,640
Beatrice wants to say something.

667
01:02:50,959 --> 01:02:55,279
Gingerbotton dies the same thing that happens to Jesus in the bottom of God.

668
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,640
He also dies.

669
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,160
Wow, that's good.

670
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,040
That's good.

671
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,800
I have to think about that.

672
01:03:01,759 --> 01:03:03,360
Yes, he does.

673
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:10,319
And then he says that he's gone for a while, that he'd come back for a while, but that's only a little while he comes back.

674
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:14,959
And then he sends the Holy Spirit, which is some mixture.

675
01:03:14,959 --> 01:03:27,279
I've been convinced by one of you who came to office hours, that the Holy Spirit is some mixture of the articulator and a kind of mood.

676
01:03:27,279 --> 01:03:36,800
But whatever it is, and I have, I'll talk more about that later if the guy who's teaching it to me explains it to me more.

677
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:40,560
But Jesus is gone.

678
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:42,000
Why isn't that?

679
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,399
Well, now, Beatrice, here's the answer.

680
01:03:44,399 --> 01:03:46,720
I mean, the answer is a puzzle.

681
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:54,759
If Jesus says he has seen me and seeing the Father, and then Jesus is gone, so you can't see him anymore.

682
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:57,480
I mean, he's just an idea.

683
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:00,039
Then what are you supposed to see?

684
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:02,759
If you can't see, I think this is what happens.

685
01:04:02,759 --> 01:04:07,079
That's why the Virgin Mary comes in and gets to be so important, although I'm not sure.

686
01:04:07,399 --> 01:04:14,040
There's got to be something incarnate that you can see in this religion and love and adore.

687
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:28,039
And if Jesus is gone, well, then you've got to make statues to Jesus and statues to those you can't just go off and contemplate some disincarnated thing, the supreme being.

688
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:35,319
You can't go back to the Hebrews who don't think you can make a picture or who shouldn't worship all these.

689
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:44,759
It upsets the Jews who see these Christians sort of lighting candles and so forth in front of the Virgin Mary and in front of the statue of Jesus.

690
01:04:44,759 --> 01:04:48,520
But I think this following Beatrice, you're stuck with that.

691
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:55,640
If Jesus, try to put it my way, if Jesus comes around and says, I'm God, if you've seen me, you've seen the Father.

692
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:58,039
You can't even see the Father anymore.

693
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:59,080
You've got me.

694
01:04:59,319 --> 01:05:00,839
I'm better to see.

695
01:05:00,839 --> 01:05:04,520
I'm the one thing you can see and so forth.

696
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:07,880
And then leaves, this is a big problem.

697
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,479
I don't know what to think about.

698
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:13,320
Of course, he's coming back eventually, but what are you supposed to do in the meantime?

699
01:05:13,319 --> 01:05:15,799
Of course, that's the other strange thing about Christians.

700
01:05:15,799 --> 01:05:25,800
They've not only got the problem of having to have something concrete to adore once Jesus is gone, and that's a big puzzle.

701
01:05:25,799 --> 01:05:33,080
But then they're all, particularly early Christians, thought, well, Jesus is coming back right away, which is another logical response.

702
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:42,479
If you've seen him, you've seen the Father, and he leaves for a while, and he says, I'm coming back, he must mean right away.

703
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:46,480
And so they were waiting for the end of the world immediately.

704
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,000
And then it would have made sense.

705
01:05:48,000 --> 01:06:00,160
Then everybody would have got their bodies back, and Jesus would have been there in his body, and it would have all been going around with what's called glorified bodies, better bodies than you've had before, according to St.

706
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:01,840
Augustine, anyway.

707
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:05,279
And then it would have worked out, but it didn't work out that way.

708
01:06:05,279 --> 01:06:07,839
And maybe, and now Dante's got this problem.

709
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:21,840
If Beatrice is right, I mean, I mean, sorry, that Beatrice is right, that if Dante's Beatrice disappears and dies, what's Dante supposed to do?

710
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:28,960
Well, I don't, this won't illuminate you any, but it's important to say, only Kierkegaard's got it figured out.

711
01:06:28,959 --> 01:06:52,080
I mean, Kierkegaard's got the whole thing trying to, Kierkegaard's got a view about how a Christian can always have, must have, an unconditional commitment to something embodied and finite and temporal, and how it could be have that even though people die.

712
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,239
But you can't have, I mean, that's Philosophy VII.

713
01:06:54,239 --> 01:06:54,960
I can't.

714
01:06:54,959 --> 01:06:58,880
But anyway, you know, so Dante isn't only caught.

715
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:00,319
It's fascinating.

716
01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:02,160
It's always fun to learn something.

717
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:15,039
So Dante isn't only caught between a kind of coherent Christian view and a coherent Greek view, represented by the Gospel of John on the one hand and Aristotle and St.

718
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:16,720
Thomas on the other.

719
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:23,319
But there is an incoherent Christian story told in the Gospel.

720
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:30,359
I mean, that you have to keep seeing Jesus to see the Father, and that Jesus leaves and goes and you can't see him anymore.

721
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:34,039
And yet, supposedly, you're not supposed to see the Father anymore.

722
01:07:34,039 --> 01:07:38,119
So there's a big problem in the Gospels.

723
01:07:38,119 --> 01:07:43,799
And so it's not as if, I'm just saying it to myself, the Gospel is a coherent story, and look what a mess St.

724
01:07:43,799 --> 01:07:45,399
Thomas is making of it.

725
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:56,839
The Gospel is a very, very interesting, complicated story, and different interpretations of it, different articulations of it, try to make it coherent.

726
01:07:56,839 --> 01:08:00,680
So you've got two articulations coming around.

727
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:19,079
The romantic, chivalric one, where Dante should have loved Beatrice ever after and got her body back and they lived happily forever after, embodied and the Day of Judgment came around very, was coming any minute.

728
01:08:19,079 --> 01:08:21,239
That's a coherent story.

729
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:23,959
And the St.

730
01:08:23,959 --> 01:08:27,799
Thomas, Aristotle's story was a coherent story.

731
01:08:27,799 --> 01:08:38,039
The real God is an abstract God, and the whole role of Jesus was only to be the way that led you to the truth.

732
01:08:38,839 --> 01:08:45,720
So the real interesting issue is, I guess, whether how we get together Jesus being the truth and the way in the end.

733
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:48,199
I mean, is Jesus the apparent?

734
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:51,720
If Jesus is the truth, then what are you going to do when he goes away?

735
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:52,600
That's not a pun.

736
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:54,039
I mean, there's two different things.

737
01:08:54,039 --> 01:08:59,799
So if he's the truth, then you better stay around or come back soon.

738
01:09:00,119 --> 01:09:12,479
Or is he the way, since he didn't stay around and come back soon, which takes you to a God that is not him, but some abstract, eternal something.

739
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:17,279
And then, of course, we don't understand how he's the truth, but only the way.

740
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:25,119
I mean, there's some puzzle in here, and I think Dante's struggling with it, and everybody is.

741
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,839
You look like you want to say something, right?

742
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:29,119
What?

743
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:31,199
Okay, but somebody did.

744
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:33,359
Then, Kevin, did you want to say something?

745
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:37,839
Okay, I saw a hand or a glimmer that somebody was going to try to help out.

746
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:47,199
I mean, in a way, this Beatrice has helped out, but only by making matters worse, which is always a good step in some direction.

747
01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:48,239
Did you want to say something?

748
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:48,799
No.

749
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:50,560
Okay, yes, Kevin, did you?

750
01:09:51,119 --> 01:10:06,480
I mean, when Jesus said that he's coming back, did that mean that not that Jesus is literally coming back, but that it's going to be a good practice of romantic love and that they'll need Beatrice's.

751
01:10:07,039 --> 01:10:08,079
That's good.

752
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:13,759
Okay, that's how I would read it, but I don't think that's going to answer this Beatrice here question.

753
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:17,839
I mean, yes, it should be that this is Kierkegaard.

754
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:29,199
I mean, somehow when Jesus is coming back, it means somehow everybody's going to have their object of total unconditional romantic commitment.

755
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:36,239
And somehow even death isn't going to change that.

756
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:42,480
Yes, but I mean, that's a very complicated story that nobody figured out until Kierkegaard.

757
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:50,439
It isn't enough to say that Jesus isn't coming back, that everybody should have their Beatrice, but of course their Beatrice is going to die too and go away and not come back.

758
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:51,720
That's the problem.

759
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:53,799
That's Dante's problem.

760
01:10:54,440 --> 01:11:02,119
I mean, he wasn't able, I mean, you have to be a genius like Kierkegaard to think it out and try to make it coherent.

761
01:11:02,119 --> 01:11:04,519
Anybody else want to say anything about it?

762
01:11:04,759 --> 01:11:19,640
I was going to go on to summarize things, but I'm not worried that I didn't get to it because what I want to, in the last lecture, I'll try to put it together, what Dante thinks about, for instance, free will.

763
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:23,959
I've been skipping the free will part, but it's too, with three minutes to go.

764
01:11:23,959 --> 01:11:25,560
I don't want to start the free will part.

765
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:25,959
Yeah.

766
01:11:28,919 --> 01:11:31,959
Am I saying that the contemplation can't be what?

767
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:35,239
Well, I want to say it shouldn't be.

768
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:40,279
I am saying that contemplating God is Dante's solution.

769
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:41,879
I mean, that's what he says in the book.

770
01:11:42,039 --> 01:11:47,879
You'll read the Paradiso over occasion and you'll see him contemplating God, and it's totally satisfying.

771
01:11:47,879 --> 01:11:49,720
What more could anybody want?

772
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:51,399
That is his solution.

773
01:11:51,400 --> 01:12:07,640
But it seems to me it conflicts with his view that Beatrice is sort of the totally adorable being that allows him to soup up his love completely and satisfy it.

774
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:29,799
And of course, the problem is Beatrice is gone, and then I'm just thinking out what you're saying, and then the next best thing is to go back to a vision of God as eternal and the supreme being, out of utterly un can die and everything.

775
01:12:30,119 --> 01:12:35,720
And it looks like that shouldn't be possible.

776
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:44,799
Because when you've seen Jesus and Beatrice, you've seen the Father, and you've seen that you can have it all, the incarnation, the spiritual and the physical.

777
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:51,839
Why would you settle for the pure s how could you get back in touch with the pure spiritual and how would it satisfy you?

778
01:12:51,839 --> 01:12:52,640
You get the last word.

779
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:53,680
We have one minute.

780
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:59,119
Ah, no, you're saying what Kierkegaard calls the night of resignation.

781
01:12:59,119 --> 01:13:08,479
That is, the night of resignation makes the meaning of the love of Beatrice the eternal, secure, fulfilling thing.

782
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:11,839
I mean, that isn't the move Dante makes because he goes on directly to God.

783
01:13:11,839 --> 01:13:12,799
And that's better.

784
01:13:12,799 --> 01:13:19,199
That saves more to keep Beatrice as Jesus in the picture to make the meaning of the relation.

785
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:20,959
But it wasn't a meaning relation.

786
01:13:20,959 --> 01:13:23,919
It was a physical incarnate relation.

787
01:13:23,919 --> 01:13:28,799
It still loses the flesh to make the meaning the solution.

788
01:13:28,799 --> 01:13:31,919
And therefore, I don't think it's completely the solution.

789
01:13:31,919 --> 01:13:35,680
Although it's the next move in the history of the story.

790
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:36,480
Okay, that's it.

791
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:37,600
Have a good vacation.
