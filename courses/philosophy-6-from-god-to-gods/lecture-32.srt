1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:35,760
And so now, we were in the middle of my list of Melville's understanding of what kind of meaning we can find in a godless world, where I mean godless with a capital G, that is, a world with no supreme being and a world with no onto theology, that is, because Buddhism doesn't have a supreme being, but it still has one total view about the true nature of everything.

2
00:00:35,760 --> 00:01:00,800
And once you give up on that, and it becomes more and more implausible to the people in our culture, and probably gradually the West takes over everything, and science takes over everything, and it becomes more and more implausible in all cultures, then what have you got left as possible sources of meaning?

3
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:10,961
And the only one I did last time talked about was the pagan, which is represented by KweQ.

4
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:20,160
And that's got to do with some kind of saving understanding in the culture.

5
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:30,361
And part of that saving understanding, I don't, it isn't spelled out enough to be able to say just exactly how this works, is carved on Kwiquweg's body.

6
00:01:30,681 --> 00:01:58,281
That is, there's a tradition, and that tradition is sacred because, to put it in a Pascali way, I think I may have said this, custom is our nature, so that we are the kind of human beings that the tradition in our culture makes us, and things show up for us as the kind of things they are because of this tradition in our culture.

7
00:01:58,281 --> 00:02:03,160
So, in a way, the tradition is doing the job of the Creator God.

8
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:11,560
It's making us, it sort of creates us and the things we deal with, and that's why it's sacred.

9
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:21,160
And just preserving it is some way preserving the saving power of that tradition.

10
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:27,001
And to preserve it, you don't have to do much because it's carved into your body anyway.

11
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:38,040
But you do seem to have to have a sense of its importance, and that's why it gets carved on his body explicitly and why he copies it onto his coffin.

12
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:53,321
The nearest thing I can think of it is Judaism, where there is a supreme being, but the supreme being, the creator God, doesn't seem to be nearly as important as the tradition, which is what is sacred and what you've got to keep.

13
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:58,920
And the pagan is just that same idea, but without the supreme being.

14
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,401
Okay, I don't have more to say about that.

15
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,321
I do have one more thing to say.

16
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:10,360
I think I said something wrong last time, or at least if I don't remember whether I actually said it or just thought something wrong.

17
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:21,680
But when on page 400 we see Quique dying, which he doesn't do, but what?

18
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,720
I've somehow got my page number wrong.

19
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,880
Where is Cuique dying?

20
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:29,281
Queque in his coffin.

21
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:31,841
Help me find the chapter.

22
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,760
Here we are.

23
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:36,480
It's chapter 110.

24
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,281
It's page 460.

25
00:03:42,160 --> 00:04:01,040
I read this passage where I won't read the whole thing again, but he's dying and his eyes deeply looked out at you there from his sickness, a wonderful testimony to that immortal health in him, which could not die or be weakened.

26
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:18,961
I can't remember exactly what I said, but I think I said something like: well, nobody gets healed of whatever it is that's basically incomplete and needy about human beings, the way that they are, quote, cracked about the head and in need of mending.

27
00:04:18,961 --> 00:04:20,401
And that's wrong.

28
00:04:20,401 --> 00:04:24,961
I mean, Melville thinks there are ways of getting healed.

29
00:04:24,961 --> 00:04:30,800
That he didn't say that people are cracked about the head and in need of mending and that they're unmendable.

30
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,321
And I don't know.

31
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:38,800
Did I give the impression that even dying Queque was still somehow sick?

32
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,761
It's not true.

33
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:44,160
He's physically sick, but he's got immortal health in him.

34
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:52,480
That's to say, his way of relating to the sacred in the tradition, in his culture, has healed him.

35
00:04:52,480 --> 00:05:08,761
And it was easier in his culture because it wasn't corrupted by onto-theology, so that people wanted something more, namely total experience of total God that made everything intelligible and gave you eternal fulfillment.

36
00:05:08,761 --> 00:05:16,120
When that gets in the way, as it does in Dante, everything, as we saw, else gets lost.

37
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:25,081
So Quiqua didn't have to worry about that, and therefore his sacred tradition, as appreciated and carved in his body, healed him.

38
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:35,321
And so he can die physically, but he is no longer sick with whatever it is that human beings are sick with.

39
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,440
I think I wasn't clear about it, but I am now clear about it.

40
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:50,281
And now, unless anybody wants to say anything more about it, I'm going on from the pagan story to the next story.

41
00:05:50,281 --> 00:06:00,360
I'm sure the weirdest chapter in the book, maybe the weirdest chapter in any book, I don't know, which is The Squeeze of the Hand, chapter 94.

42
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,441
It's a very important chapter.

43
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:13,720
I mean, it's important to the people who try to read it psychologically, who try to worry about whether Ishmael is or is not gay, and who try to see if this is Freudian or Jungian or what.

44
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:29,401
I mean, of course, that's not why I think it's important to me, or I don't know if this is how it was to Ishmael, but we've got to read it and see that lots of interesting things are going on here, starting on 402.

45
00:06:31,481 --> 00:06:39,241
So, starting at the third paragraph in chapter 94, he's talking about the new job he's got.

46
00:06:39,241 --> 00:06:40,680
It was a little way down.

47
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,681
It was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid.

48
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:55,841
So, there they had this big tub of the sperm out of Moby Dick that they were, why I don't know, he doesn't tell us, squeezing it back into liquid.

49
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:04,241
But on 403, he tells us that it completely changed his mood.

50
00:07:04,241 --> 00:07:13,281
He'd been in this mood of monomania that he had taken over from Ahab, and Ahab's curse and search had become his.

51
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:30,561
And now he gets rid of that on 403 and gets switched into another mood, not again by choosing, but by being drawn in, he's drawn into the mood as far from Ahab as you can get, about 15 lines down on 403.

52
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,481
For the time I lived as in a musky meadow, I forgot all about our horrible oath.

53
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:43,601
That's the other mood, when Ahab dipped the harpoon in blood and made them all swear to go after Moby Dick.

54
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:49,520
In that inexpressible sperm, I washed my hands and my heart of it.

55
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:56,401
I mean, in other words, I completely got out of that mood, and I completely got into this mood.

56
00:07:56,961 --> 00:07:59,680
So he was in sync with Ahab.

57
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,601
What's he in sync with now?

58
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:09,440
Well, he's in sync with all the other people who, or the other subgroup of sailors from the boat.

59
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,561
I don't know how they got picked or who they were, who were doing this job together.

60
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,641
So in the middle of 403, I squeezed that sperm till I myself almost melted into it.

61
00:08:20,641 --> 00:08:24,080
I squeezed that sperm until a strange sort of insanity came over me.

62
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,920
This was this very strange mood.

63
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:32,680
I found myself unwittingly squeezing my co-laborer's' hands in it, mistaking their hands for the gentle gobules.

64
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:40,601
Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving feeling did this avocation beget.

65
00:08:40,601 --> 00:08:43,801
And this is sort of friendship at its best.

66
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:49,081
And it's related to this friendship he has for Quequeg.

67
00:08:49,481 --> 00:08:58,121
That's the only other time we hear about this kind of special loving mood that you can get into that's very important.

68
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:10,121
It certainly seems to be erotic, and it certainly seems to be sentimental, but he quickly gives it a broader and very interesting meaning.

69
00:09:10,121 --> 00:09:12,521
And that's at the bottom of the page.

70
00:09:12,521 --> 00:09:25,641
Remember, the subject we're interested in is: can you find meaning in a world without onto theology, without the supreme being and the total order?

71
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,480
In short, without Dante.

72
00:09:27,721 --> 00:09:30,761
That's the guy in our course that stands for this.

73
00:09:30,761 --> 00:09:44,521
And the answer is yes, but only if you don't insist on total, eternal fulfillment the way you're supposed to get it if you stare at God at the end of the divine comedy.

74
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:46,041
So here's what he says.

75
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,441
Second line at the bottom paragraph.

76
00:09:48,440 --> 00:10:01,561
For now, since by many prolonged or repeated experiences, I have perceived that in all cases, man must eventually lower or at least shift his conceit of attainable felicity.

77
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,841
That's a mouthful.

78
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:09,801
His conceit of attainable felicity means he's got to lower his demand for what happiness is.

79
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,001
What kind of happiness you can attain.

80
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:20,961
That is, you can't have total, eternal, unconditional, and absolute fulfillment.

81
00:10:21,281 --> 00:10:27,921
So you have to place it, not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy, but in.

82
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:41,361
And now comes a whole list of particular, temporary, sometimes short-term, sometimes long-term, local-ish forms of satisfaction.

83
00:10:41,361 --> 00:10:56,080
The wife, and I'll keep giving you sort of, just so you see what's going on, each of these is going to be a mood, and each of these is going to be related to some goddess or god in the pantheon, roughly the Greeks.

84
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,160
It doesn't map completely, but there's the wife, that's the domestic mood, that's Hera.

85
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,041
The heart.

86
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:14,401
I take the heart is the friendship that he's been having because it's this kind of warm, very affectionate feeling that you can have for your fellow human beings.

87
00:11:14,401 --> 00:11:19,521
The bed, I take that to be sex and Aphrodite and the erotic.

88
00:11:19,521 --> 00:11:21,761
The table, it's not, of course.

89
00:11:22,001 --> 00:11:23,361
Have I talked about this already?

90
00:11:23,361 --> 00:11:25,121
I suddenly, no, good.

91
00:11:25,361 --> 00:11:28,080
I remember something that I thought to myself.

92
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:33,681
The table isn't, of course, a kind of special relationship to tables like this.

93
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,321
It means food.

94
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:46,801
It means being concerned to make good meals and to take the trouble to get the meal set up and cook the food and get the people together.

95
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,521
I did talk about it in some other connection, didn't I?

96
00:11:49,521 --> 00:11:50,801
Where, how?

97
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:52,080
I don't know either.

98
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,960
But it's all right.

99
00:11:52,961 --> 00:11:54,481
I'm talking about it again.

100
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,160
It's another one.

101
00:11:56,481 --> 00:12:08,361
It's more short-lived, but it's a local, temporary world around the dinner in which all these people are brought together and they're all brought out in their best.

102
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:18,521
Heidegger has this idea that you can make these self-contained worlds which have their own meaning and bring things out in their own most, as he puts it.

103
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:27,481
So fathers and mothers and children and vegetables and all are brought out at their best when the dinner comes out right.

104
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:29,721
And that's another one of these things.

105
00:12:29,721 --> 00:12:35,881
It's not like staring into God in the divine comedy, but it is a kind of happiness.

106
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:39,320
The table, the saddle, that's for horse people.

107
00:12:39,641 --> 00:12:41,321
My daughter was one of them.

108
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,201
And that goes, Captain Kirk obviously was one of them.

109
00:12:44,361 --> 00:12:48,281
We talked about how that's when he went to his sort of retirement.

110
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,521
It was some beautiful horses.

111
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,521
The fireside.

112
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,961
The fireside is a funny one.

113
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:01,160
I'm having this deja retreat that I, oh, I talked about this in another lecture.

114
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,601
I gave it another state in another week.

115
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,281
I don't think I did.

116
00:13:06,281 --> 00:13:08,521
I tell you about the foyer?

117
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:17,721
Okay, the fireside is interesting because it's the example of these kinds of focal practices.

118
00:13:17,721 --> 00:13:20,840
Focal practices is what a guy named Borgman calls them.

119
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:45,201
There's no reason why you should know about Albert Borgman, but he did write a very good book, and it was about the way focal practices are different than what he calls the just enjoying commodities, where you just get the result and you don't have to do any work and you don't have to have any skill, and it always gives you just the thing you want, and nothing more or less.

120
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:50,800
So, fast food is the commodity version of the cultivation of the table.

121
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,840
And in the case of the foyer, it means in French, fireplace.

122
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,241
The fireplace is the foyer.

123
00:13:58,241 --> 00:14:13,441
It's the focus because once it was the focus of the family, in which they had to have the skill for cutting the wood, for keeping the fire going, and they had to sit around it to keep warm and to cook and presumably to read the Bible or whatever they did in those days.

124
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:21,361
And therefore, the fireplaces are sort of the model or a kind of focal practice.

125
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:24,720
And they turn into commodities in a funny way.

126
00:14:24,721 --> 00:14:32,321
That's what I suddenly stopped and remembered that I told this to some other group, and I'll tell it to you too, because it's sort of pathetic and funny.

127
00:14:32,641 --> 00:14:34,881
My daughter shows up in this again.

128
00:14:34,881 --> 00:14:44,241
I mean, the idea that sitting in front of the fireplace is the way to sort of be when you're at home, she had that.

129
00:14:44,241 --> 00:14:55,281
Unfortunately, we didn't have any fireplace, but she instead always did her homework and petted the cat and talked to her friends sitting on the hot air vent in the floor in the living room.

130
00:14:55,681 --> 00:15:07,840
And that's what's left of the fireplace as it's turning into a commodity, where the heat just comes there and it doesn't have any focus and it doesn't take any skill and it doesn't unite anybody around it.

131
00:15:08,161 --> 00:15:18,241
And the last pathetic thing I thought was, well, the next generation is going to have radiant heat in the floor and not even any hot air coming in through a vent, and that's the end of it.

132
00:15:18,241 --> 00:15:25,761
Heat will have turned completely from the spokes of the family into something so much of a commodity that nobody will even know.

133
00:15:25,761 --> 00:15:30,600
The room, the thermostat will do its job, and the room will stay the same temperature summer and winter.

134
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:38,441
And there's a danger that all of these can be gotten rid of by being turned into commodities.

135
00:15:38,441 --> 00:15:40,200
The next one is the country.

136
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,360
That means patriotism, I suppose.

137
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:54,761
You could think of that as the Aeneas, or you could think of that as what Athena brings about in the Orestea, where the pride in Athens is the meaningful thing.

138
00:15:54,761 --> 00:16:17,640
So all of these, that list, is a list of somewhat meaningful practices which could still make your life worth living, but you can only have them if you lower your standards and don't insist that it be a complete knockout of the traditional Dante story.

139
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:24,040
Okay, then that's what's so interesting about that particular chapter.

140
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:32,761
And what's, I realized just yesterday that he's prepared you for this, or I mean, that would give much too much of a sense that he knows what he's doing.

141
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:53,080
But something in him came out earlier that is related to this when on 102, when you get another one of these absolute people, the guy who doesn't think, who isn't insisting on an absolute relation to God, in fact, he's thinking about an absolute relation to nothing.

142
00:16:53,080 --> 00:17:03,320
That's Balkington, standing in the howling gale of the infinite, in the indefinite and the ungrounded, and not asking for any meaning.

143
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:08,921
But for him, he doesn't want the port, the land.

144
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:12,920
But here there's a good story about the land on 102 at the top.

145
00:17:12,921 --> 00:17:18,640
In the port is safety, comfort, hearthstone, there we go again, the fireplace.

146
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:20,081
Supper, there's the table again.

147
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,761
Warm blankets, friends, there's the love again.

148
00:17:23,761 --> 00:17:26,481
All that's kind to our mortalities.

149
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:43,920
And it's not, notice, talk about the slavish land here and how nobody in their right mind would go and walk around on that turnpike earth with its landmarks all over and no indeterminate, no mystery.

150
00:17:43,921 --> 00:17:57,361
There is the side of Melville which really does appreciate a kind of much lowered but nonetheless satisfying and meaningful way of life.

151
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:04,080
And it comes up there, and it certainly is, for him, a kind of sacred.

152
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:14,241
So the fireplace and cultivating your dinner and all, and the Aphrodite erotic and all that can be sacred.

153
00:18:14,241 --> 00:18:33,200
And the way you can see it in this funny way on the bottom of 403, after he lists all these local moods, I keep wanting to say two of these, there is a mood, of course, I keep forgetting to say, which goes with each of these, whether it's the erotic mood or the domestic mood or the aggressive mood and so forth.

154
00:18:33,201 --> 00:18:37,040
All of this, he says, where is it now?

155
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:44,800
I am ready, and after I perceived all this, I'm ready to squeeze case that is sperm eternally.

156
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,321
And then the sacred.

157
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:55,761
In thoughts of the visions of the night, I saw long rows of angels in paradise, each with his hands in a jar of spermacetti.

158
00:18:55,761 --> 00:19:11,160
I mean, instead of getting a total contemplation of God in paradise forever, you get the opportunity to have, in this case, this sort of sensuous, loving, friendly relation to other people around this job.

159
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:14,600
So, okay, so that's what there is to say about that.

160
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:27,640
That activity gathers together the people and the angels, and in Heidegger jargon, that is the mortals and the gods, and so forth.

161
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,161
And it creates little worlds.

162
00:19:29,161 --> 00:19:33,880
That's certainly a world for a while around the squeezing of the sperm.

163
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,080
So much for that.

164
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,920
Now, it's interesting to contrast this.

165
00:19:38,921 --> 00:19:46,440
Melville is really wonderfully sort of complicated because he always sees all sides of everything.

166
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:59,241
And there are happy moods where people have lowered their, what is it, something, demand for felicity, that is their sense of happiness, and they've lowered them too much.

167
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,360
You wouldn't think he would have a story about that.

168
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:08,281
What would it be like to have a wrong version of this?

169
00:20:08,281 --> 00:20:13,800
Well, this will make do with friendship as a kind of mood.

170
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,481
And what would be wrong with it?

171
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:16,841
Well, what would be wrong with it?

172
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,921
Well, let's see if you can figure out what's wrong with it.

173
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:43,481
The example of it is the Samuel Enderby, the ship, where he meets Boomer and Bunger, the two happy captain and ship's doctor, which who live in an ordinary, sort of happy, seeming kind of domestic or whatever, I mean, friendly, no, it's a really friendly mood.

174
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:51,680
And it turns out that he starts making it look very attractive, but by the end, it's not attractive.

175
00:20:51,681 --> 00:20:54,800
And you have to understand why he doesn't like it.

176
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:05,601
Okay, so it starts out looking attractive on 421, where he describes one of them, which one?

177
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,481
I don't remember.

178
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:07,601
It doesn't matter which.

179
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,121
I think it's Boomer.

180
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:17,360
But the middle of the top paragraph, he was a darkly tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man of 60 thereabouts.

181
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,040
And he had one empty arm.

182
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,481
Yeah, that's Captain Boomer.

183
00:21:22,721 --> 00:21:27,441
Moby Dick took the other arm into his jacket.

184
00:21:27,441 --> 00:21:30,001
But he seems like a really attractive guy.

185
00:21:30,001 --> 00:21:33,281
As I read it, it reminds me very much of the description of Bulkington.

186
00:21:33,281 --> 00:21:40,640
But you could think of him as the absolute anti-Bulkington, who is so a heroic nihilist.

187
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,681
These people are neither heroic nor nihilist.

188
00:21:43,681 --> 00:21:52,001
But not that Nelville wants you to be heroic and nihilist, after all, Bulkington got dumped into the sea almost immediately.

189
00:21:52,001 --> 00:21:54,080
But there's something wrong with these people.

190
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,001
We have to figure out what it is.

191
00:21:56,001 --> 00:22:00,001
And on 425, you get a feel for it.

192
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:02,241
You could have jumped into the story anywhere.

193
00:22:02,241 --> 00:22:05,281
I'm just jumping in the middle of 425.

194
00:22:05,921 --> 00:22:07,920
Boomer says to Dr.

195
00:22:07,921 --> 00:22:10,481
Bunger, Bunger, you dog, laugh out.

196
00:22:10,481 --> 00:22:11,281
Why don't you?

197
00:22:11,281 --> 00:22:14,160
You know you're a precious jolly rascal.

198
00:22:14,161 --> 00:22:19,360
Oh, heave-ahead, boy, I'd rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man.

199
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:28,400
And you can just see the sort of goodwill and jolliness that goes through all this, the constant banter between them.

200
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:35,400
And, of course, they're not interested in chasing Moby Dick the way Ahab is, because they're happy as they are.

201
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:46,201
You see this on 426, the middle of the page, where Boomer says, with about five chasing Moby Dick, don't want to try to.

202
00:22:46,201 --> 00:22:47,960
Ain't one limb enough?

203
00:22:47,961 --> 00:22:50,440
What should I do without this other arm?

204
00:22:50,761 --> 00:22:54,360
And I'm thinking Moby Dick doesn't bite so much as he swallows.

205
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,920
I don't quite know what that line means.

206
00:22:56,921 --> 00:23:01,320
Maybe he thinks that the next time he encounters Moby Dick, he might be swallowed altogether.

207
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,521
I don't know.

208
00:23:03,161 --> 00:23:10,360
But he does say something very important because you want to keep in mind all the interpretations of Moby Dick.

209
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,720
And here he's got one, he says, a little below that.

210
00:23:13,721 --> 00:23:17,560
What you take for the white whale's malice is only his awkwardness.

211
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,001
It's not his song.

212
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:19,800
Good.

213
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:24,761
It's only his awkwardness, for he never means to swallow a single limb.

214
00:23:24,761 --> 00:23:27,721
He only thinks to terrify by feints.

215
00:23:27,721 --> 00:23:29,481
So there's just another view.

216
00:23:29,481 --> 00:23:32,040
By the way, here I will stop for a parenthetical remark.

217
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:40,521
As I told you already, I can't keep from discussing the final three chases that make up the exciting ending of the book.

218
00:23:40,521 --> 00:23:46,120
And I am putting it off till Tuesday by running out of here and giving you the evaluations.

219
00:23:46,681 --> 00:23:52,200
But read like mad over the weekend, because you're going to have to read it sooner or later anyway to write a paper on it.

220
00:23:52,201 --> 00:24:01,241
And because it's such a great book, and I would rather you, for your fun, that you read it through to the end before I have to tell you the end.

221
00:24:01,241 --> 00:24:08,040
But of course, what's going to have to become clear in the end is what is Moby Dick really up to?

222
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,521
What is the meaning of Moby Dick?

223
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:15,281
And of course, the answer is not going to be anything simple.

224
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,640
But I won't tell you even a hint what.

225
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:26,481
But keep your eye open every time they chase Moby Dick, whether who's got the right interpretation of what he's up to.

226
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:29,920
Is he a dumb brute, which Starbucks says?

227
00:24:29,921 --> 00:24:39,680
Is he a moral avenger, as he is in the story of Steelkilt, which you'll read in here, where the bad guy gets knocked into the sea and swallowed up by Moby Dick and so forth.

228
00:24:39,681 --> 00:24:41,440
Okay, back to where I am.

229
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:48,880
These guys sit around and they laugh and they have fun and they give you that perspective on Moby Dick.

230
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:57,120
And Boomer doesn't feel any need to get revenge or ultimate answers or recognition that he's important in the universe.

231
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,040
He's just happy to sit and drink and make jokes with his old buddy Bunner.

232
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:06,160
And they sound like a kind of vaudeville team and they're full of good cheer.

233
00:25:06,161 --> 00:25:08,481
So what's wrong with it?

234
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,640
Anybody know?

235
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,640
There's two things wrong with them in the Melville world.

236
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,401
Well, anybody?

237
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:23,761
How many moods do you think they've got?

238
00:25:23,761 --> 00:25:26,401
Don't you have the feeling that they're locked into one mood?

239
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:34,160
That they've been in this kind of joking, drinking, backslapping, funny frame of mind forever.

240
00:25:34,161 --> 00:25:35,761
And that's bad.

241
00:25:35,761 --> 00:25:40,800
The idea is to get the rainbow of moods, not to get stuck in one mood forever.

242
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,080
I think that's half of what's wrong with it.

243
00:25:44,241 --> 00:25:49,680
And the other half of what's wrong with it is it's somehow a shallow mood.

244
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:53,921
I don't know what to say about that, except that it doesn't somehow gather enough.

245
00:25:53,921 --> 00:25:59,200
It doesn't gather the divinities, and it doesn't bring out mortality.

246
00:26:01,721 --> 00:26:06,281
There's something certainly, from Melville's point of view, superficial.

247
00:26:06,281 --> 00:26:17,720
And you can get the contrast when you see because Melville earlier before he presents them, in a way tells you what's wrong with them.

248
00:26:17,721 --> 00:26:18,681
And I'm going to read it.

249
00:26:18,681 --> 00:26:20,120
And this time it's your turn.

250
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,001
See if you can tell.

251
00:26:21,001 --> 00:26:23,880
You better be able to tell what this says is wrong with it.

252
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:30,040
Besides, there's simple-minded mono-mood is it's something wrong with that mood.

253
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,481
And here, here it is, on page 410.

254
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,961
Complicated things are happening.

255
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:42,680
It's not just about Boomer and Bunner at all, but they're implicated.

256
00:26:43,161 --> 00:26:46,840
But keep your eye open for the big, important thing.

257
00:26:46,840 --> 00:27:08,680
So starting the first full paragraph, two-thirds down on page 410, when it turns out that he's been in a very strange mood, looking into the fire, and he looked into the fire so much, and he thought he saw devils dancing around in the triworks, when they were cooking the fat.

258
00:27:08,681 --> 00:27:10,600
I think that's where we are now.

259
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,680
No, the cassock.

260
00:27:12,761 --> 00:27:13,881
Yeah, the triworks.

261
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:19,080
Okay, that's when they cook the meat and render out the fat of the whale.

262
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,920
And he's had this feeling that they're devils dancing around the fire.

263
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:24,920
And he says, look not too long.

264
00:27:24,921 --> 00:27:26,201
And he gets in that mood.

265
00:27:26,201 --> 00:27:31,961
And then he almost capsizes the ship because he gets so hypnotized that he forgets which direction they're going.

266
00:27:31,961 --> 00:27:34,681
Look not too long in the face of the fire, O man.

267
00:27:34,681 --> 00:27:37,001
Never dream with thy hand on the helm.

268
00:27:37,001 --> 00:27:39,241
Turn not thy back to the compass.

269
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,800
Accept the first hint of the hitching tiller.

270
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:47,120
Believe not the artificial fire when its redness makes all things look ghastly.

271
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,400
Now, why not?

272
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:55,840
Well, not because you shouldn't be in that mood sometimes, but tomorrow in the natural sun, the skies will be bright.

273
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:09,840
Those who glared like devils in the forking flames, the morn will show in far other, gentler relief, the glorious golden-clad, glad sun, the only true lamp, all others but liars.

274
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:18,241
So he flips you from that night moon to the how it's really the truth is that everything is terrific.

275
00:28:18,241 --> 00:28:20,320
The sun is shining and everything is bright.

276
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,680
Anything wrong already?

277
00:28:21,681 --> 00:28:29,201
If you're reading carefully, you see, even if this was in some other translation, I would say, uh-oh, look at the translation.

278
00:28:29,201 --> 00:28:29,841
What is that?

279
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,440
The only true lamp?

280
00:28:31,441 --> 00:28:35,600
I mean, there isn't any only true in Ishmael and Mel.

281
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,600
What is he talking about?

282
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,320
Well, it isn't a mistranslation, of course.

283
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:54,800
He goes on, nevertheless, and here we go in the other direction: the sun hides not Virginia's dismal swamp, nor Rome's accursed Campania, nor wide Sahara, nor all the millions of miles of deserts and of grief beneath the moon.

284
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:59,841
The sun hides not the ocean, which is the dark side of this earth, and which is two-thirds of this earth.

285
00:29:00,161 --> 00:29:07,200
The brightness of the sun is rapidly being cut down to one perspective, and not even the biggest.

286
00:29:07,201 --> 00:29:16,800
So, therefore, that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him, that mortal man cannot be true, not true or undeveloped.

287
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:20,960
Okay, now, can you relate that to Boomer and Bunner?

288
00:29:20,961 --> 00:29:30,761
If it's a no-brainer, if you can't figure out why, now you understand, presumably, something about what's wrong with their totally constant jolliness.

289
00:29:31,961 --> 00:29:38,200
Well, they have no sense of the dark side, of the grief, of the fact that it isn't always sunny.

290
00:29:38,201 --> 00:29:42,521
And he says it next right away: the truest of all men was the man of sorrows.

291
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:45,800
The truest of all books is Solomon and Ecclesiastes.

292
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,761
In the fine hammered steel of woe, all is vanity, and so forth.

293
00:29:50,761 --> 00:29:52,840
Now he switches over to that.

294
00:29:53,161 --> 00:29:58,920
And now he's going to say what's wrong with them and everybody else who's in a constant jolly mood.

295
00:29:58,921 --> 00:30:12,440
He who dodges hospitals and jails, walks fast across graveyards, and would rather talk of operas than hell, calls Cowper, Young, Pascal, and Rousseau poor devils, all sick men.

296
00:30:12,441 --> 00:30:20,281
And there, and throughout a carefree lifetime, swears by Rabelais, who is in sort of a jolly mood, too, apparently.

297
00:30:20,281 --> 00:30:23,560
I haven't read Rabelais, but I think I've liked Boomer and Bunner.

298
00:30:23,961 --> 00:30:27,560
Swears by Rabelais wise and therefore jolly.

299
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,521
There's the key.

300
00:30:28,521 --> 00:30:30,440
Jolly is what they were.

301
00:30:30,441 --> 00:30:32,840
And it's all right to be jolly sometimes.

302
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,360
But it's not all right to be any mood all the time.

303
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,880
And it's particularly not all right to be jolly all the time.

304
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:48,680
So not that man is fitted to sit down on tombstones and break the green damp mold with unfathomably wondrous Solomon.

305
00:30:49,241 --> 00:30:49,560
But.
