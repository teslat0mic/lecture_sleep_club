1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,401
Okay, then I'll go back to something which is to me very exciting.

2
00:00:06,401 --> 00:00:20,560
Namely, a student came to office hours yesterday, the first one in, and it presented me with serious, serious objections to what I've been saying, which is just what I hope happens.

3
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,480
Because I'll learn something.

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,840
We'll all learn something.

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:35,240
If you have to have a theory before you can have counterexamples to your theory, but then you're in a position to make a better theory, to take account of those examples.

6
00:00:35,241 --> 00:00:52,600
So let me tell you what the students said, and then how I intend to defend my position by restating it and encourage all of you to do that because it's really important to push on the limits of an interpretation.

7
00:00:52,600 --> 00:01:07,240
Okay, the issue is, and some of you have been discussing this in section I just learned from the TAs, the issue is how much free will and responsibility do people have in Homer for doing the bad things.

8
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:18,920
And I said last time that they didn't have any, that it was always, they were either being pulled, they were being pulled into things by the gods when they did anything.

9
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:43,560
But I sort of already knew that that doesn't help explain what happens when they do bad things, when the suitors stay around when it isn't appropriate any longer, eating up all Odysseus' food, when the serving girls sleep with the suitors, for which they all get killed eventually, when Odysseus kills all the cattle of the Hylias, the sun god, and they all get killed.

10
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:53,961
They seem to be free to do those things and responsible for having done them and blamed and punished for having done them, but that just sounds like modernity.

11
00:01:53,961 --> 00:01:57,480
And that's I'm claiming there's something different going on here.

12
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:04,200
Well, there are various ways of trying to get out of this interesting problem.

13
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:11,001
One way is to try to deny that they ever have free will and that they and responsibility.

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,201
That would be interesting.

15
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:13,720
That would be radical.

16
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,600
Homer's world would be then utterly different than our world.

17
00:02:14,681 --> 00:02:19,040
I'm not going to go that way.

18
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,720
I think that it's pretty clear in Homer that they can choose, that the suitors could have chosen to leave.

19
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,521
And that I don't know whether the serving girls have much autonomy, but the suitors certainly do.

20
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:45,280
And there are other places, it's a possible paper topic to go through and look at all the places where people do what seem to be free things, take responsibility for them, get blamed for doing what they do them wrong, and so forth.

21
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:52,240
Remember, we got into all this because Helen certainly doesn't get blamed and isn't free.

22
00:02:52,240 --> 00:03:17,360
She's open to the goddess Aphrodite, and when she does what Aphrodite draws her to do, in the light of Aphrodite's erotic shining, Menelaus says that was a great story you just told, and the last line of the stanza is that she goes to bed with Menelaus and lies there peerless among women.

23
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,360
That sounds pretty good.

24
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,240
So there it looks like, and this is how I want to read it now.

25
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:45,600
There it looks like that when you do the right thing, the best thing, when you fight like Aries or make craftsmanship things like Hephaestus or make love like in the light of Aphrodite, when you do those things, you are performing at your best.

26
00:03:45,600 --> 00:04:02,201
And oddly enough, and this is my strange claim, when you act freely, psychologically, on the basis of your desires, you can do that, and you're responsible, and you get blamed.

27
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:05,081
And the interesting thing is, you do bad things.

28
00:04:05,401 --> 00:04:20,120
People who don't act in the light of the gods of the pantheon have only one other possibility, that they act out of their own personal, selfish interests and sort of narrow goals.

29
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,961
And it looks to me generally like it's modernity turned upside down.

30
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:31,401
It isn't that in modernity, Kant is the best example.

31
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:34,360
If you go on to other philosophy courses, you'll hear about this.

32
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:45,641
Kant says you should act freely, giving the law that you're following to yourself, and you shouldn't let yourself be influenced by what you should be autonomous.

33
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:47,800
That means give the law to yourself.

34
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,001
You shouldn't allow yourself to be heteronomously influenced.

35
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,401
That big word means the opposite of giving the law to yourself, letting something outside you direct you to do what you do.

36
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:10,280
And Kant thinks all heteronomous determination is bad, and free, responsible action is good.

37
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,001
And when you give this law to yourself.

38
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:22,360
Now, it looks like, I think, and I haven't proved it and worked it out, but I will if I get time and try, that it's just the opposite in Homer.

39
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,961
It isn't that Homer denies free choice and responsibility.

40
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:42,841
It's just that when, instead of acting as drawn by the gods, acting what Kant would call heteronymously, under another power, and when you act under your own power, freely choosing what you do, then you do bad things.

41
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:46,641
Nobody, I think, in the book freely chooses to do some good thing.

42
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:54,160
It's always in the light of Aphrodite or Aries or Athena that they do their positive things.

43
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,201
So it's not that he doesn't have enlightenment insights.

44
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,761
He does understand psychology.

45
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:15,040
It would be so alien that I wouldn't be able to make sense of it if he didn't think that people could have desires that go against what they should be doing, what's appropriate, and act on them and get blamed for them.

46
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:17,120
They can do all that.

47
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,160
But the last thing, get blamed for them, is the crucial thing.

48
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,240
When you do that, you get blamed.

49
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,160
Nobody, as far as I know, in the book, gets praised for doing things because they freely chose it and desire it.

50
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:29,441
You have an exception?

51
00:06:29,441 --> 00:06:30,401
That would be good.

52
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,040
More consciousness than we use what we do for higher than Athena.

53
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,241
Yeah, Athena, it makes them act more obnoxious.

54
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,240
I remember that.

55
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,201
Good.

56
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,240
Complicated.

57
00:06:44,240 --> 00:07:05,921
I mean, she, I mean, this is an interesting case, and I can only say something relatively weasily about it, but it seems to me that they've already done something freely and selfishly and bad, sitting there killing the cattle and taking the serving girls as their mistresses and so forth.

58
00:07:05,921 --> 00:07:08,561
And they've already done all that.

59
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:17,841
And now what Athena does isn't it isn't sort of in the light of Athena that they do something good.

60
00:07:18,161 --> 00:07:23,441
It's just that she sort of freezes them into this bad thing that they've done.

61
00:07:23,441 --> 00:07:26,480
I can't understand why that's a job for Athena.

62
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:32,361
The only way it comes out in the Odyssey, and I'm afraid that's the best I can do, she's always helping out Odysseus.

63
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:42,841
And what she wants to do at this point is sort of: we don't want the suitors suddenly to try to freely take back what they've done and say they're sorry and they get ready to leave.

64
00:07:42,841 --> 00:07:51,481
They've done something so wrong, and they have to be punished, and she's going to keep them from leaving so that he can kill them.

65
00:07:52,520 --> 00:08:04,681
The important thing is, go ahead, you look like that's right, she's ensuring that they are punished for, I think, freely and responsibly doing something, namely something bad.

66
00:08:04,681 --> 00:08:19,161
And maybe, whenever you do something freely and responsibly, it's either something trivial and neutral, like what clothes you decide to wear, or if it's something important, it's dangerous to do it, because if you're not called from a god to do it, where else could you be called from?

67
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:23,720
Well, your own selfish psychology, and that's going to get you into trouble.

68
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,240
So, but your point is good.

69
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:27,720
I think Athena just tries to reinforce it.

70
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,361
Yeah.

71
00:08:28,681 --> 00:08:29,401
Yes.

72
00:08:29,961 --> 00:08:32,040
And have I contradicted anything in the book?

73
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,560
I hope not when I say that.

74
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:39,001
Yes, I think what the gods, I'm going to have to make a qualification, which I'm explaining in a minute.

75
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:54,201
When the gods in the pantheon, anyway, which is the main gods we've been concerned with, when they call you to do something, it's always the appropriate, honorable, best kind of thing to do.

76
00:08:54,201 --> 00:09:01,720
So if you're open, like Helen, to whatever the gods call you to do, people will praise you and admire you no matter what.

77
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:09,720
Even if you later regret it, even if thousands of people die because of it, what Helen did was terrific.

78
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,881
That much is weird.

79
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:19,601
Let me, before I get too far, I'll take up the question in a minute, but I don't want to lose a stack in my head.

80
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,201
So I want to say one more thing, a general thing.

81
00:09:23,201 --> 00:09:41,441
Regardless of whether it's the Enlightenment upside down, which would be wonderful if freedom and autonomy were all always led you to do inferior things, there must, I look back up to the following point to defend my view.

82
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:53,121
I want to say, yeah, there is something very different about them where psychology and freedom and responsibility is concerned.

83
00:09:53,120 --> 00:10:00,321
If it isn't always leading to bad stuff, and I think that might be the case, at least it's not what's most important.

84
00:10:00,321 --> 00:10:07,121
It's marginal and rather trivial, the freedom and responsibility issues.

85
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:17,921
The big issues are around Aphrodite and running off, Helen running off, and Aries and the fact that people can fight furiously and so forth.

86
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:30,161
That Homer is really interested in the power that comes from you if you're open to the authority of these various moods, and marginally interested in psychology and so forth.

87
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:40,801
And at least this much is clearly true: that when you get to the Enlightenment, Kant and Descartes and so forth, us moderns, it gets reversed.

88
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:46,720
We're majorly interested in what people freely choose to do.

89
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,280
This is what Kant and Descartes did to us, better or for better or for worse.

90
00:10:51,281 --> 00:10:53,441
We moderns care about that.

91
00:10:53,441 --> 00:11:03,401
We are marginally interested in moods and the way other powers from outside the person could come and enable them to do things.

92
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:10,521
We don't think that these other powers ever enable them to do anything really good because it's heteronomous, not autonomous.

93
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:34,121
So it's gets, so what I'm saying is when you flip a culture to another culture, which needs a reconfigurer in there, Kant and Descartes together did the job, you make what were marginal practices, marginal stuff, central, that is, in this case, freedom and responsibility.

94
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,360
And you can see it even the other way, even better.

95
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,281
And you make what was important stuff trivial.

96
00:11:40,281 --> 00:11:41,801
What are moods for us?

97
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,881
Trivial, fleeting.

98
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,561
Nobody could get away with saying, well, I left to their husband.

99
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,441
Well, I left you and the kid for 10 years because he was in the very erotic mood.

100
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:55,321
I mean, that's just, that won't go.

101
00:11:55,321 --> 00:12:08,760
And moods in general are either dangerous, you get into a too aggressive mood and start beating up your colleagues and your boss, that's not a good thing to do, or trivial.

102
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:16,281
We talk about moods being inner, being fleeting, being out of control, and that's bad.

103
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,081
I mean, bad and not in big deal moral.

104
00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:20,760
That makes them inferior.

105
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,761
Let's say not bad, inferior.

106
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,480
Okay, now, all this because I was sort of challenged on this.

107
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:34,760
You see, if I'm right, it's a lot more interesting than it was, because it's not just that they don't have psychology.

108
00:12:34,761 --> 00:12:37,321
There's much more richness and complexity.

109
00:12:37,321 --> 00:12:38,841
Now, Beatrice wanted to say something.

110
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,120
Why is it Athena's job that she picked into things together?

111
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:56,081
I think in the whole last TCV they act for Zoo as a profit for Zooto together with them, and he is the one that needs to revenge for stranger either.

112
00:12:56,321 --> 00:12:56,961
Good, good.

113
00:12:56,961 --> 00:12:59,681
And that fits with what we said already, right?

114
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:02,321
She has to sort of, they're not going to get away with it.

115
00:13:02,321 --> 00:13:06,480
They're not going to, now at the last minute, say, well, we're sorry we did it.

116
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:16,880
They've done something so bad and so against the rules of Zeus, and I now want to say so free and autonomously that they are going to get it.

117
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,561
And Zeus is going to do it.

118
00:13:18,561 --> 00:13:24,720
And Athena's just acting as the agent of Zeus and fixing them in it.

119
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:25,600
Okay.

120
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,921
Now, that's only half the problem.

121
00:13:28,161 --> 00:13:34,321
The other half of the problem is more upsetting because I don't know quite how to deal with that.

122
00:13:35,841 --> 00:13:44,321
The student who was talking to me said that being swept away by a mood isn't always good.

123
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:59,441
And I don't remember whether he came up with these examples or I did, but there are, certainly there are fleeting moods like happiness and sadness, and they aren't big deal moods on the basis of which you can make a life.

124
00:13:59,761 --> 00:14:03,121
They are really fleeting and inner.

125
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:13,120
And there are also, and they're psychological, but there are also, and this is where it gets scary from my view, bad ontological moods.

126
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,881
An ontological mood is a mood that determines your whole life, your whole world.

127
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:26,240
So Helen is always subject to being sensitive to what is erotic in the situation.

128
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,641
And Aries is always ready for a fight and so forth.

129
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,801
And you can be a whole belligerence can be a way of life.

130
00:14:29,281 --> 00:14:36,681
And eroticness can be a way of life.

131
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,961
And so there are trivial moods and there are ontological moods.

132
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,401
So far, no problem.

133
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:50,761
But now comes the puncher that there are moods that can be ways of life that are not good ways of life.

134
00:14:51,161 --> 00:14:56,761
You can be in a sulky mood all the time.

135
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,161
I think my son was in that for several years.

136
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:08,280
And sort of counter-suggestive and thinking that everything is going to go badly and has gone badly and will always go badly for you and so forth.

137
00:15:08,281 --> 00:15:10,041
Not a very good mood to be in.

138
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:22,041
You can be in a kind of giddy mood where you're always sort of doing what is sort of fun and irresponsible, no matter what's going on.

139
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,641
And there's a problem.

140
00:15:25,961 --> 00:15:31,480
Now, what happens is the gods in the pantheon are all positive moods.

141
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:47,640
It's good to be in a domestic mood like Hera or a craftsman mood like Hephaestus or in a belligerent mood like Aries or in that culture anyway, or in a loving, open mood like Helen.

142
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,400
Those are all positive moods.

143
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,721
But now we got the funny situation.

144
00:15:53,400 --> 00:16:02,280
How come some moods get to have gods and get to be in the pantheon, and other moods like sulky or giddy, and I'm going to give you more important ones.

145
00:16:02,281 --> 00:16:05,240
How about like piety?

146
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,561
You'd think that mood is serious.

147
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:14,120
That would be respect for the tradition all the time.

148
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,960
That mood doesn't get into the pantheon.

149
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,920
Or and here's a mood, a very important one for today.

150
00:16:20,561 --> 00:16:27,761
Vengeance, being all your organizing all your life around vengeance is a mood.

151
00:16:28,241 --> 00:16:35,360
makes you a world and there's equipment and there's roles and so forth and vengeance doesn't get into the pantheon.

152
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,360
So what's the moral of that?

153
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:48,160
Well, that somehow the gods are the the representatives of the good moods.

154
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,760
And now that raises the interesting question, two interesting questions.

155
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,721
One is, now it looks like there are hierarchies of moods.

156
00:16:54,721 --> 00:16:58,801
And I was saying, you know, the Homer isn't making any judgments.

157
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:01,200
Well, he's making judgments, all right?

158
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:12,240
And I thought I could get out of it at first by saying, well, Homer's for all the world-defining moods the moods, the ontological ones, but he doesn't care about the psychological ones.

159
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:16,880
But that's not right, because as we just saw, they're world-defining moods.

160
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,321
The most interesting ones for us, well, the ones for us are the moods the Furies have.

161
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:32,160
In Aeschylus, they're always in the mood of outrage and resentment, and also vengeance.

162
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,360
Those are those they are their life.

163
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,600
People under the Furies can devote their whole life to vengeance.

164
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,440
But I want to I forgot this outrage and bitterness.

165
00:17:43,761 --> 00:17:45,440
Those are all moods.

166
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,001
And they it's even got gods, namely the Furies, that they aren't allowed in the Pantheon.

167
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:50,240
Yeah.

168
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:58,640
Because, for example, in the Gilead, I parrot down against Aries.

169
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,321
So both of them have this huge hubris.

170
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:05,160
So maybe that mood as well is the same.

171
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:07,960
Hubris he's talking about, which is pride.

172
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,440
So you probably, how many of them have studied Oedipus?

173
00:18:12,761 --> 00:18:14,520
That's where you're most likely to hear about it.

174
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:15,241
Lots of you.

175
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:16,120
Good, good.

176
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,521
Okay.

177
00:18:16,521 --> 00:18:17,481
Anyway, go ahead.

178
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,761
Other moves are susceptible.

179
00:18:29,721 --> 00:18:33,960
I don't know if I understood you, but I'll say back and then you can tell me whether I have.

180
00:18:33,960 --> 00:19:35,041
I say that each god represents a a mood so total that it can be a whole life can be in the t have be lived in in the tendency to constantly go into this state aggressive state or sexy state or whatever and they can define whole worlds where there is equipment and roles and and so forth and and most people the good people are under one of these moods or the other or have this kind of tendency to have like Helen and and so forth a certain kind of life or Achilles he's under the Aries and and then there are these cool people Odysseus who has a peculiar kind of mood which is a mood which I keep calling a James Bond like mood where he's always ready always alert always on the ready uh always uh suspicious of what's going on and ready for some thing to happen, and he's going out with it.

181
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:41,400
That I guess that's a mo I hope that's a mood too, because that's Athena is the goddess of that mood.

182
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:44,281
Have I said anything that's relevant to what you said?

183
00:19:44,321 --> 00:19:50,961
Yeah, I have to yeah, yeah.

184
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,681
What makes somebody act in a certain way?

185
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,400
Like, what makes Helen like God's hand so much?

186
00:19:58,721 --> 00:19:59,761
Good question.

187
00:20:00,081 --> 00:20:03,041
I think, well, what about what do I think?

188
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:11,041
I don't think, see, if you thought that you could choose to be in a mood or not to be in a mood, it's a good question.

189
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:18,241
You would have flipped it over into the Enlightenment way of looking at things, because then choice and responsibility would have trumped moods.

190
00:20:18,241 --> 00:20:24,561
No, the interesting thing about moods has got to be you can't choose what mood to be in, and you can't choose to get out of them.

191
00:20:24,561 --> 00:20:29,521
If you're in a melancholy mood, you can't wish you were in an upbeat mood.

192
00:20:29,841 --> 00:20:31,360
You're just stuck with it.

193
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:40,481
And if Paris looked so attractive to Helen that she just couldn't resist him, remember I said it was like eyes wide shut.

194
00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:48,400
I mean, where the lady says, if the sailor walked by and whistled, I would just leave you, or she's saying to her husband and child.

195
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,680
You don't choose that.

196
00:20:52,321 --> 00:20:56,960
Some people are open to these moods, and that's good people.

197
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,321
And some people aren't, and those are people who are just not so good.

198
00:21:00,321 --> 00:21:04,721
I think that's the one thing is sure you can't choose to get in and out of these big moods.

199
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,521
But that's what makes it anti-enlightenment.

200
00:21:07,521 --> 00:21:09,600
That's why Kant wouldn't like these moods.

201
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,761
They are heteronymous determinations.

202
00:21:11,761 --> 00:21:13,680
They are not freely chosen.

203
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,240
You can't give a mood to yourself.

204
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:17,920
You can't get out of a mood.

205
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,040
You can't even, in Heidegger's jargon, get behind a mood.

206
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:25,120
That is, you can't understand why you're in it or what it would take to get out of it.

207
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,400
Does that help?

208
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,041
Yeah.

209
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,881
Well, well, I can't hear you.

210
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,520
Hey, my question, who's my, you're my question.

211
00:21:32,761 --> 00:21:34,280
Are you my first person?

212
00:21:35,721 --> 00:21:37,481
Who helped with the microphone last time?

213
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,321
I heard it on the iPod and it was true.

214
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:48,440
If you choose on your own to do something like the suitors did, does that mean that you're denying your mood?

215
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,281
If I choose to do something on your own?

216
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,721
Yeah, if you make a decision on your own, then is that denying a mood?

217
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,600
No, you heard her.

218
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:03,400
If you make decisions on your own, that just means no mood has grabbed you.

219
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,160
And if a mood does grab you, you can't make decisions on your own.

220
00:22:07,321 --> 00:22:35,880
And the idea that a culture would like that and think that those moods are wonderful because they have, remember when I talked about what you have to have something to keep you from being a laid-back relativist, so open-minded that anything goes, what has authority in that culture, what is sacred, about which you can't laugh, is just exactly moods because they have this power to take you over.

221
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,200
They have higher authority than you.

222
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,600
They are the limit to your freedom.

223
00:22:42,521 --> 00:22:43,480
That's good.

224
00:22:43,481 --> 00:22:51,001
That makes all your actions more meaningful than if you could just choose to get in a mood or out of them.

225
00:22:51,721 --> 00:22:56,441
Or if you could just choose, like a modern person, to say, well, I'm in this kind of mood, but that's not important.

226
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm going to go on with my job, my life plan, my decisions.

227
00:23:01,001 --> 00:23:02,440
Those are what matter.

228
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,721
Then I think they would be less meaningful than these moods.

229
00:23:05,721 --> 00:23:07,880
At least that's the Homer feeling.

230
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,520
Yeah.

231
00:23:08,841 --> 00:23:10,200
Wait, wait, I'm going to give you the mic.

232
00:23:11,481 --> 00:23:12,041
Okay.

233
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,680
You've got to.

234
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,040
With your podcast, you're on, you know, you're on the air.

235
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:17,680
Go ahead.

236
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,001
Okay.

237
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:19,600
I just want to understand.

238
00:23:19,761 --> 00:23:36,161
So if you're working within the moral universe of the Odyssey and you are Helen and you make a decision and you, or so you follow a mood, and you are therefore good, how can Helen be considered good when her actions lead to the death and suffering of thousands of people?

239
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,360
I don't understand how that works.

240
00:23:37,761 --> 00:23:43,200
Okay, well, you don't understand how it works because you're a modern person.

241
00:23:50,160 --> 00:24:06,401
Suppose you were in a culture in which openness to an authority, something sacred and holy, higher than your will, was what was really valuable and meaningful and important, then it's really too bad.

242
00:24:06,721 --> 00:24:08,081
It's unfortunate.

243
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:10,561
I'm going to say tragic because that's the special thing.

244
00:24:10,561 --> 00:24:16,561
But it's very unfortunate if your openness causes all these bad things.

245
00:24:16,561 --> 00:24:21,360
But if it's hard to get used to, that's why I started the lectures with Helen.

246
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:30,960
That's all in the sense that, well, not, I don't know, she regrets it, she says that she ran off like that, but nobody blames her.

247
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,880
But you can regret it, and that's it.

248
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:59,280
I think it's a trade-off to have a world in which there is really serious meaning and something sacred at which you can't laugh, and something that has authority so that things are not just up for grafts, then this is one way to do it, to make moods absolutely important.

249
00:24:59,321 --> 00:25:09,720
And it does have, that's the trade-off, a consequence that you can be led to do things which have disastrous consequences.

250
00:25:09,721 --> 00:25:11,240
But you won't be blamed.

251
00:25:11,241 --> 00:25:15,240
Nobody will say, oh, that bad person, she should have resisted the mood.

252
00:25:15,561 --> 00:25:18,360
One, you really can't in this picture.

253
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,200
And two, you shouldn't.

254
00:25:20,761 --> 00:25:24,760
That's why, but it is, you know, it's pretty weird.

255
00:25:24,761 --> 00:25:26,521
But that's why I wanted to start with that.

256
00:25:26,521 --> 00:25:31,081
But then you don't want to get trapped into the other view, which I did until today.

257
00:25:31,081 --> 00:25:38,841
Namely, it's a culture in which nobody ever has any decisions, can't freely act, can't be blamed, and so forth.

258
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:46,120
And that we ought to think: did anybody cause some really disastrous something, not responding to a mood?

259
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,241
Then we can say, well, boy, are they a bad person?

260
00:25:49,241 --> 00:25:56,120
Look at the bad consequences of what they did out of their selfish, willful choice.

261
00:25:56,761 --> 00:25:57,961
That would be okay.

262
00:25:58,281 --> 00:26:01,081
That's what you want, because you're a modern.

263
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:01,720
Okay.

264
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,480
So, okay, I'm ready to go on.

265
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:09,561
I think it's wonderful that you guys are actually helping work this out.

266
00:26:09,561 --> 00:26:11,400
So let's see now where I am.

267
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,801
But there's still one big problem, which I was getting close to.

268
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:22,120
So in the pantheon are all these shining examples of good moods, or at least some of them.

269
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:27,000
Maybe they're other, they better be all the really good moods around.

270
00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:32,360
If you think of another really good mood and it isn't in the pantheon, that's a problem for me.

271
00:26:33,001 --> 00:26:39,561
So domesticness, eroticness, warfulness, craftsmanship.

272
00:26:39,561 --> 00:26:45,681
There's another goddess named Hebe who serves drinks and generally runs the cocktail parties on Olympus.

273
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:48,801
And I don't know what that is, something like sociability.

274
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,880
If those moods don't exhaust the good ones, then there's a problem.

275
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:03,521
But the big problem is, back to this hierarchy business, if you put all the good moods in the pantheon, sort of you're making a big deal judgment.

276
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:04,961
You're bringing in hierarchy.

277
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,000
Those are the good moods, and the other ones are the bad moods.

278
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:12,081
And then the question becomes, sort of, what right have you got to say that?

279
00:27:12,081 --> 00:27:13,680
On what authority?

280
00:27:14,001 --> 00:27:17,761
I think you just have to say, well, that's how the culture is set up.

281
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:24,160
If you don't see that, then you're sort of, I don't know, value blind.

282
00:27:27,281 --> 00:27:34,400
But it sounds like there's something funny and wrong and puzzling about this, because the good moods are gods.

283
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,680
They overcome you and draw you into these good things.

284
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,801
Are there gods for the bad moods then?

285
00:27:40,801 --> 00:27:41,600
Also?

286
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:54,801
Because if a god is something that you can overcome you, and then you get this problem if there are, well, how come you should be why be open to the gods in the pantheon and not the other gods?

287
00:27:54,801 --> 00:27:57,440
I'm trying to set it up for the Orestea.

288
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,520
There are gods for bad moods, and they're called the furies.

289
00:28:01,521 --> 00:28:03,680
And they do draw you in.

290
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:14,160
And people do horrible things when the whole problem of the Oristea is what to do about this mood of vengeance, which has gods behind it.

291
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:25,920
And I think, and this is what I want to say, Homer knows this problem is lurking in the background, and he does the best he can to forget about the bad moods and the gods of the bad moods.

292
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,841
And ask himself the question, why are they ranked below the good moods?

293
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:41,481
And he just puts all the emphasis on the equality of the good moods, and he doesn't even want to commit himself to ranking the bad moods.

294
00:28:41,481 --> 00:28:43,241
He just doesn't mention them.

295
00:28:43,241 --> 00:28:46,920
The furies only get mentioned, I think, three or four times.

296
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:51,321
And I'll go into that in a minute, but I don't want to do now to distract you.

297
00:28:51,721 --> 00:28:53,561
So let me look at my notes again.

298
00:28:53,561 --> 00:28:55,400
Because I said there was a big problem.

299
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:01,400
The problem is what, who, I mean, how come we get this ranking?

300
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,161
And maybe, as I say, it's not a problem.

301
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,001
You just say, well, that's what the culture has.

302
00:29:05,001 --> 00:29:09,561
It has this ranking, and these are the good moods, and these are the gods, and that's that.

303
00:29:09,561 --> 00:29:10,921
I think that's all you can say.

304
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,041
But I want to go on and read my notes in a minute.

305
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:21,000
So there are destructive, antisocial, dangerous moods like vengeance, and they can define a whole life.

306
00:29:21,001 --> 00:29:25,000
By the way, there are movies about vengeance defining a whole life.

307
00:29:25,001 --> 00:29:35,720
There's maybe some of you who remember, I can't remember the name of it, Asterio Leone movie about a guy who spends his life avenging his brother's death.

308
00:29:35,721 --> 00:29:38,680
Is it a fistful of dollars or something like that?

309
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,801
Maybe you don't know.

310
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:48,841
But there's also Chill Bill, which I haven't seen, but which I was told was a good example of vengeance being a whole life.

311
00:29:48,841 --> 00:29:55,001
So anyway, so you can make a whole life around vengeance, and then where are you?

312
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,400
I think I may have said what I want to say about it.

313
00:29:58,761 --> 00:30:09,561
Well, you want to ask what's the criterion that makes the good moods good and the bad moods bad, that enables you to select, enables the culture to select the ones that are in the pantheon.

314
00:30:09,561 --> 00:30:14,841
Maybe that's a modern question, since nobody really saw, I'm talking to myself, really.

315
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:25,841
Maybe the idea that anybody selects on any kind of principle which are the goddesses and goddess and gods, I forgot Apollo and Theory as another good life.

316
00:30:26,081 --> 00:30:35,600
Maybe the point is, we ask sort of on what principle, Kant would ask, do we select though some moods is good and some moods is bad?

317
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:43,600
I now think that's a stupid thing for me to worry about, because I think that's just exactly the wrong thing to think.

318
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,960
And from a Homer point of view, that's just how it is.

319
00:30:47,761 --> 00:30:53,841
Who are we to have sort of free choice of which are the good and bad moods or principle choice?

320
00:30:53,841 --> 00:30:57,041
Give ourselves rules for finding which gods are in the pantheon.

321
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:59,041
I'm talking myself out of that.

322
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:09,360
There isn't anything I now want to say to what I wrote here that tells you, enables you to pick the moods that are good and bad.

323
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,801
That's the tradition.

324
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:14,321
That's the way the practices work, period.

325
00:31:15,281 --> 00:31:19,440
And it's a big, big job to change that.

326
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,920
And now the Orestea, we can go to the Orestea.

327
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:37,920
The Orestea is, among other things, a large part about a very bad mood that has pretty unpleasant goddesses in charge of it, and the trouble it causes, and the suffering you have to go through in order to change it.

328
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,961
And that's that, Homer never had that problem.

329
00:31:41,521 --> 00:31:42,240
That's deep.

330
00:31:42,241 --> 00:31:43,360
That's Aeschylus.

331
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,000
But that's where we are now.

332
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,321
We're leaving Homer.

333
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,200
We're switching to the Orashea.

334
00:31:51,841 --> 00:31:56,400
And, okay, so now I want to start talking about the Orasheia.

335
00:31:56,801 --> 00:31:58,000
And here we go.

336
00:31:58,481 --> 00:32:00,200
Yeah, I think he's fine.

337
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,401
So, I've got some general things to say.

338
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,120
How many did read the introduction?

339
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:28,521
Okay, I don't think I'm going to get to the introduction today, but that's okay, because I decided when I reread it this morning that you've got to read, before you can see what's wrong with the introduction, which is I told you to look for, you really have to read enough of the play to see whether his account of what's going on actually is going on in the play.

340
00:32:28,841 --> 00:32:31,000
And so we may get to that next time.

341
00:32:31,001 --> 00:32:37,721
If you haven't read it, or if you're thinking about the introduction, ask yourself, what's wrong with the introduction?

342
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,240
Why am I saying that it doesn't fit the play?

343
00:32:41,241 --> 00:32:44,921
The play is a kind of refutation of what the introduction says.

344
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,440
But I don't think that we're, I think I made a mistake in telling you to read it.

345
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,480
I should have told you to read it after the Agamemnon.

346
00:32:51,480 --> 00:33:05,641
So anyway, the moral of all that is, for next time, read The Agamemnon, that whole play, over the weekend, so we can definitely discuss it and whether Latimer's got it right on Tuesday.

347
00:33:05,641 --> 00:33:08,761
Now I'm going to say general things about Aeschylus.

348
00:33:08,761 --> 00:33:13,721
So we turn now from something that is some ways harder.

349
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:19,321
Oh, I'm just curious, how many couldn't resist and went on and read some of the Agamemnon while you were at it?

350
00:33:19,321 --> 00:33:21,320
Okay, well, you've got other pressures on you.

351
00:33:21,321 --> 00:33:23,081
But you will see.

352
00:33:23,721 --> 00:33:31,080
You're going to turn from something that's harder, much harder, and in a certain way also easier than reading Homer.

353
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,400
Did I try to explain why.

354
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:51,440
Well, what's hard about reading Homer is, if you're going to read it my way anyway, if you're going to try to use it to understand what a polytheistic culture would be like, then you're reading it in a way that Homer isn't trying to tell, isn't interested in that.

355
00:33:51,761 --> 00:33:54,640
He's just expressing the polytheistic culture.

356
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:58,641
What he's trying to do is tell us about Odysseus.

357
00:33:58,641 --> 00:34:01,281
So we're reading it sort of against the grain.

358
00:34:01,601 --> 00:34:12,400
What we're looking for in our interpretation could be just things that are barely mentioned, like the whole affair with Helen and Paris gets settled on a page.

359
00:34:13,201 --> 00:34:16,801
And then you wonder, as you read it, what are you supposed to look for?

360
00:34:16,801 --> 00:34:18,481
And it's hard for me to tell you.

361
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:26,241
It's hard to know what to pay attention to until you've already discussed it and had a whole view about it, and then you go back and you can read it.

362
00:34:26,241 --> 00:34:29,760
But it never is what Homer is paying attention to.

363
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,160
And that's so different than Aeschylus.

364
00:34:32,161 --> 00:34:40,400
I mean, we're going to read Aeschylus just the way, presumably, the Athenian Greeks saw Aeschylus and the way Aeschylus understood himself.

365
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:45,920
I mean, we were trying to understand what the issue is and what the play is about.

366
00:34:46,241 --> 00:35:04,081
And the issue is that the relation of the gods to each other and to human beings and how that gets established and what are the advantages and disadvantages of the particular one the Athenians have got and how can it be improved.

367
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:09,921
Those are on the minds of the audience and on the minds of Aeschylus for sure.

368
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:18,001
So every detail that's relevant has something to do with that, the issue between the two kinds of gods, which you'll see.

369
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,080
The Olympian gods are still around, the pantheon, and the Furies, another kind of god.

370
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,481
We're going to talk about more of that next time after you've read the Agamemnon.

371
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:42,201
But you can tell already which details are relevant and which details are just accidental, by which details are related to this god clash and which aren't.

372
00:35:42,201 --> 00:35:58,360
And then further, you can tell what a good interpretation of the play is if it adds, if all the details that are important to Aeschylus are coherent and add up to a unified view.

373
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:05,161
So you can say, well, what is Aeschylus showing the Athenians or telling the Athenians?

374
00:36:05,801 --> 00:36:07,481
What is his picture?

375
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:27,080
And if your interpretation and mine doesn't make coherent sense of the details, if every detail doesn't fit in, then unlike the Homer one, I can say, well, his polytheism is not completely pure, and I can make sort of using him, and I can ignore the demigods and the nymphs and so forth.

376
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,760
I have no idea what to do about that.

377
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,600
Not like that in Aeschylus.

378
00:36:30,601 --> 00:36:37,481
Every detail had better fit, or it means he's not good enough, or you got it wrong.

379
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:53,800
And probably he's good enough since he won the equivalent of the Academy Award not only once, but dozens of times, because his play won the contest, as you know, if you read the introductions, won the contest for best play one year, and you're only supposed to get it that once.

380
00:36:53,801 --> 00:36:55,960
But his play was performed over and over and over.

381
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,721
It became a cult classic for the Athenians.

382
00:36:59,721 --> 00:37:04,441
And so you're pretty sure that he's got it right and got it coherent.

383
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,400
And we have to find out what his view is.

384
00:37:07,721 --> 00:37:11,321
So, but Homer was simple and clear, however.

385
00:37:11,321 --> 00:37:13,721
It was just hard to say what we were looking for.

386
00:37:13,721 --> 00:37:24,960
Now we know what we're looking for in Aeschylus, but his view is so convoluted, so complex, so deep, and that it's very hard.

387
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:32,321
I'm going to show you before the end of the hour how to read a page of this, but that's why I wanted to do that before I throw you into it over your heads.

388
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:40,321
His way of writing is to keep every level of interpretation and understanding that are relevant in play at once.

389
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:49,280
And all sorts of references to the past, the future, the myths, everything going on is in there all the time.

390
00:37:49,281 --> 00:37:54,001
So it makes it very, very thick, as you'll see when you start to read it.

391
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,720
Okay.

392
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,281
Now, I say something here that I don't understand.

393
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:03,520
No, it's funny.

394
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:09,360
This is totally independent, but I forgot to say it, so I'm going to say it now.

395
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,000
Somebody is bound to notice.

396
00:38:12,321 --> 00:38:14,000
Do you have your Odyssey with you still?

397
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,720
Probably not.

398
00:38:14,721 --> 00:38:15,280
Maybe.

399
00:38:15,281 --> 00:38:17,601
On page 199.

400
00:38:17,841 --> 00:38:19,040
I see the connection.

401
00:38:20,321 --> 00:38:26,161
What was in the background in Homer I've written here is now in the foreground.

402
00:38:26,161 --> 00:38:38,560
And that's, in a sense, what caused the Trojan War and why the war took place and what the cost of the war was.

403
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,721
I mean, Homer just doesn't really ask himself that.

404
00:38:42,721 --> 00:38:47,201
But what I wanted to just mention on 99 is in a sentence.

405
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:51,921
Now, I'm going to read it, and you tell me why it better not be the right translation for Homer.

406
00:38:52,880 --> 00:39:03,321
So, Odyssey says, Foul and dreadful was the way that Zeus, who used the wide world, vented his hatred on the sons of Atreus.

407
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:09,400
You know, the sons of Atreus are the protagonists of Agamemnon.

408
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,961
Agamemnon is one of the sons of Atreus, and Menelaus is the other.

409
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:20,601
So, this is just a mention in Homer, just a passing mention of what the whole Orestea is about.

410
00:39:20,601 --> 00:39:29,480
So, foul and dreadful, Zeus vented his hatred on the sons of Atreus, intrigues of women, even from the start, died by Helen's fault.

411
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:37,000
And Clytemnestra, that's going to be the queen we're going to read about, plotted against you half the world away.

412
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,081
He's talking to Agamemnon.

413
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,601
Agamemnon gets killed by Clytemnestra.

414
00:39:42,601 --> 00:39:50,041
But what's wrong with this thing that even from the start, myriads died by Helen's fault?

415
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,601
That better strike you as strange if you've been listening to me and reading the Odyssey.

416
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:56,841
Is it Helen's fault that there was the Tory?

417
00:39:56,841 --> 00:39:59,240
The war fault means that it was a bad thing.

418
00:39:59,241 --> 00:40:00,600
Yes, it's relevant to you.

419
00:40:00,601 --> 00:40:02,120
She's just her complaint.

420
00:40:02,121 --> 00:40:04,201
Nobody thinks it's Helen's fault.

421
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:09,240
And so why in the world is Odysseus, of all people, saying it was Helen's fault?

422
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:10,360
Well, he isn't.

423
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,360
It's a mistranslation.

424
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,561
It says, died for the sake of Helen.

425
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,481
And even that's too strong.

426
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:22,360
The Greek just says the Trojan War was caused by Helen.

427
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,120
And that's perfectly safe.

428
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:26,520
Nobody, they're not blaming her.

429
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,281
They didn't say that something she did caused the war.

430
00:40:30,281 --> 00:40:37,081
They're just saying, and it's a fact, that it was caused by Helen, by Helen going off with Paris.

431
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,160
And so I had to say that.

432
00:40:39,161 --> 00:40:48,321
And anyway, since that paragraph is in Homer, what Aeschylus is going to make into three plays, we should look at it.

433
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,641
And now, let's start with Agamemnon.

434
00:40:52,641 --> 00:40:55,920
And we have to understand, do we need that?

435
00:40:56,641 --> 00:40:58,000
I think I want to skip that.

436
00:40:58,241 --> 00:40:58,880
Yeah.

437
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,360
Okay.

438
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,480
So what are the gods in Aeschylus?

439
00:41:03,201 --> 00:41:11,360
They are so different that you need to be prepared not to expect them to be like the Homeric gods, even though they've got the same name.

440
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:17,121
Apollo and Aphrodite and Athena and so forth are all there.

441
00:41:17,121 --> 00:41:20,001
There's a general lesson to be said in this.

442
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:29,601
Never, and you'll learn this in this course, if nothing else, you can't just assume because you've got the same word, that you've got the same concept or the same object.

443
00:41:29,601 --> 00:41:41,121
Look, God is going to turn out to mean amazingly different things in Plato, I'm sorry, in Homer, in Aeschylus, in the Aeneid, in Dante.

444
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,001
So what are gods here?

445
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,961
They're not moods anymore.

446
00:41:46,960 --> 00:42:13,441
They're something more like cultural values or cultural practices, cultural taken-for-granted ways of doing things that govern people's actions, that determine what is appropriate and not appropriate to do, and thereby lead people to do, most of the time, the appropriate thing and not the inappropriate thing.

447
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:31,080
And the gods set up this framework for the culture, or the gods are something more like the name for the fact that there are these values built into the activities and the language and so forth of the culture.

448
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:38,201
And different gods are related to different aspects of the culture.

449
00:42:38,201 --> 00:42:54,521
And if the culture has contradictions in it, like it might, like it might, for instance, before Martin Luther King, we had a culture that both said everybody was equal and then treated African Americans as if they weren't equal, or women as if they weren't equal.

450
00:42:54,520 --> 00:43:02,121
Cultures can have in their practices incoherent, contradictory attitudes.

451
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:07,880
Then the gods in that culture, and to talk like Aeschylus, would be fighting with each other.

452
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,400
And that's exactly what's happening.

453
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,801
You'll find the gods here fighting with each other.

454
00:43:11,801 --> 00:43:14,601
You don't find the gods at home fighting with each other.

455
00:43:14,601 --> 00:43:28,041
They sometimes play tricks on each other, do things behind each other's back, but they don't insult each other and spit on each other and generally hate each other, which they do in Aeschylus.

456
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:33,960
And it's an interesting kind of view.

457
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,201
It's not polytheism anymore.

458
00:43:36,201 --> 00:43:38,841
They're not a plurality of gods.

459
00:43:38,841 --> 00:43:45,241
There's sort of two camps of gods, the Furies and the Pantheon.

460
00:43:45,241 --> 00:43:48,601
And those, and they're in a kind of opposition.

461
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,281
So it's not polytheism anymore.

462
00:43:52,281 --> 00:43:55,160
But they're really only two divine forces.

463
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,040
That's true.

464
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:04,600
The Pantheon has a lot of different gods in it, but they all stand together against the Furies, who have a lot of people there, and they all stand together.

465
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:08,281
So it's not polytheism, but it's not monotheism either.

466
00:44:08,281 --> 00:44:23,201
It's sort of bi-theism, that is, there are these two forces, but and there's, oh, yeah, but it's got it, it's tended toward monotheism in a creepy way.

467
00:44:23,201 --> 00:44:34,880
By a creepy way, I mean bad things are happening because both sets of gods each one claim that they're the right ones, the true ones, the only real gods.

468
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,241
Their way of looking at things is the right way.

469
00:44:40,241 --> 00:44:44,481
That's tending towards sort of fanaticism and monotheism.

470
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:50,321
And it's true, Apollo is a kind of Enlightenment fanatic before his time, you'll see when you get there.

471
00:44:50,321 --> 00:44:55,281
And the Furies are reactionaries, whose reactionaries you can get.

472
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:07,761
And each of them, and that's the interesting thing, wants a claim that their values have absolute authority over from all the other values.

473
00:45:07,761 --> 00:45:09,841
And that's not in Homer.

474
00:45:09,841 --> 00:45:17,121
I mean, that's exactly not the sort of pluralism of polytheism.

475
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:23,441
Aphrodite doesn't say that everybody should be swept away by love, nor Aries by war.

476
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,680
But in Aeschylus, it's something like that.

477
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:30,001
It's that any god, they don't do that because they're Homeric gods.

478
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:39,841
But the pantheon, represented mainly by Apollo, and the Furies each say our way is the only way of doing things.

479
00:45:39,841 --> 00:45:45,441
And that halfway move toward monotheism gets you tragedy, I think.

480
00:45:45,601 --> 00:45:51,200
A very peculiar, special kind of tragedy that only Aeschylus, as far as I know, is on to.

481
00:45:51,201 --> 00:45:52,961
It's not like Oedipus.

482
00:45:52,960 --> 00:46:00,681
Try to forget everything you learned about tragedy when you read Oedipus and read Aristotle on Oedipus, if you did.

483
00:46:02,121 --> 00:46:03,960
This is a cultural tragedy.

484
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,201
It's not an individual tragedy.

485
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,600
I'll try to make that a lot clearer.

486
00:46:08,601 --> 00:46:10,680
It's an ontological tragedy.

487
00:46:10,681 --> 00:46:13,321
It's not a psychological tragedy.

488
00:46:13,321 --> 00:46:19,001
And it doesn't make any difference what anybody thinks or feels or believes.

489
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:27,080
It's what the culture cares about and requires and also cares about and doesn't want.

490
00:46:28,121 --> 00:46:35,880
And it's the conflict of these two sets of values, each one claiming that there's no place for the other one.

491
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:43,081
Each then, thereby tragic, fanatical, head-on collision.

492
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:51,641
And what Aeschylus is going to do, you'll see in Agamemnon when you read it, is bring this conflict to a head.

493
00:46:51,641 --> 00:46:58,121
Make it out in the open so that you can see how incoherent and how dangerous it is.

494
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:06,041
And somehow try to move the culture toward, in effect, a kind of monotheism.

495
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,721
Though it's not really that.

496
00:47:07,721 --> 00:47:14,921
It's really move the culture so that all the gods are reconciled and all pull in the same direction.

497
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,561
But that's not until the third play.

498
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:26,041
So the gods in Aeschylus, just to sort of say it again, are no longer exemplars, givers of attunement.

499
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,241
They don't appear in the guise of friends like Mentes.

500
00:47:29,241 --> 00:47:32,681
They don't help people to change worlds from child to adult.

501
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:39,001
And they don't shine a light on people when they're in sync with each other and the shared situation.

502
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,760
It's a summary of all the things the gods in Homer do.

503
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,920
They mostly don't appear at all, the gods in Aeschylus.

504
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:55,121
And when they do appear, they appear as themselves and defend their ranking of the values against the other gods who defend theirs.

505
00:47:55,841 --> 00:47:57,681
That happens in the third play.

506
00:47:57,681 --> 00:48:04,721
Mostly they insult each other and show absolutely no tolerance for each other, the two sets of gods.

507
00:48:05,201 --> 00:48:08,961
Put it another way, in Homer, the gods all respect each other.

508
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:14,961
They are coordinated worlds, and Hermes and Athena facilitate moves between them.

509
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,841
In Aeschylus, that's all gone.

510
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:22,081
And Zeus has a new job, as does Athena.

511
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,680
Hermes isn't even mentioned anymore, and so forth.

512
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:51,281
Now, for the rest of the time, I want to just read the opening chorus speech in the Orestea, which you should have with you, and you should now be bringing it with you every time, and show you sort of one, it's a way of telling you how to read this book without, as I say, sinking and never coming back.

513
00:48:51,281 --> 00:49:00,161
And also, I can tell you lots of facts you need to know that you're going to have to make sense of it, because there are all these references in Aeschylus all the time.

514
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:10,400
So, Aeschylus assumes that the reader already knows the myths and the names for every character in every country that's mentioned, making it hard for us to read.

515
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,841
It wasn't hard for them.

516
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:17,121
We know the name of our main leaders and countries and politicians.

517
00:49:17,681 --> 00:49:20,000
But there's a hard thing, too, about the chorus.

518
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:27,201
The chorus sometimes is very into the deep truth and sees deeply into what's going on.

519
00:49:27,201 --> 00:49:33,160
But other times, the chorus is made up of the everyday people of Argos and they don't understand much of what's going on.

520
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:38,761
They're worried and frightened and see that bad things are happening but they don't know quite why.

521
00:49:38,761 --> 00:49:41,081
And you just have to use the context.

522
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,440
And that's what the Greeks had to do.

523
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,360
The chorus was the same people, but it stands for different things.

524
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:56,921
You have to know from the context whether the chorus is saying deep and illuminating things or sort of just what everybody in the man in the street and woman in the street believe.

525
00:49:57,241 --> 00:49:59,240
Okay, let's see.

526
00:49:59,241 --> 00:50:03,801
So when the chorus is talking in dark, tragic terms, then it's it's deep.

527
00:50:03,801 --> 00:50:06,281
Otherwise, it's confused.

528
00:50:06,281 --> 00:50:08,681
And so now here we go.

529
00:50:08,681 --> 00:50:11,560
We're going to skip the watchman's speech at the beginning.

530
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:16,360
That's just straightforward situation setting.

531
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:21,081
The watchman says, looks like they won the war and they're on the way home.

532
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:37,641
Now, starting on page 36, from now on for the rest of the time, I'm going to just read line by line what's going on, and you can write in the sort of code for recognizing all these names and so forth.

533
00:50:37,641 --> 00:50:38,841
Here we go.

534
00:50:38,841 --> 00:50:40,841
The chorus enters speaking.

535
00:50:40,841 --> 00:50:43,960
Ten years, and you know what that is.

536
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:46,281
The war lasted 10 years at Troy.

537
00:50:46,281 --> 00:50:57,400
Ten years since the great contestants of Prime's right, Prime, you wouldn't know unless you read the Iliad, is the king in Troy, and they are contesting his right.

538
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:07,081
That is, they are Paris had no right to run off with Helen, and Prime had no right to protect Paris.

539
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:14,561
And that's all because, I mean, we know all that about guests, and not guests aren't supposed to run off with the host's wife.

540
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:17,841
So they're contesting what Prime did.

541
00:51:18,161 --> 00:51:24,241
Now, Menelaus and Agamemnon, those are the two great contestants.

542
00:51:24,241 --> 00:51:28,641
Those are the two brothers who are leading the war.

543
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:37,601
My lord, but my lord being Agamemnon is the lord of the people who are in the chorus because the chorus is the people of Argos.

544
00:51:37,601 --> 00:51:40,560
So, okay, so they're getting all the punctuation.

545
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:57,600
Ten years since the great contestants of Prime's right, Menelaus and Agamemnon, my lord, that is Agamemnon, twice throned, the two of them, each have his throne, twice scepred in twofold power of the king from God, the Atridi.

546
00:51:57,681 --> 00:51:58,721
Stop from there.

547
00:51:58,721 --> 00:52:00,720
You notice anything funny there?

548
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,681
God with a capital.

549
00:52:03,681 --> 00:52:05,441
That's just nonsense.

550
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,120
There's nothing in the Greek that says God has a capital.

551
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,521
The word in the Greek is something like the divine.

552
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,080
So that's why God is in the singular.

553
00:52:18,801 --> 00:52:24,801
And so the kings of kings from God, where are we?

554
00:52:24,801 --> 00:52:26,561
And the Atridi.

555
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,920
Well, you know what that is?

556
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,281
You've got to just all I code.

557
00:52:29,281 --> 00:52:32,960
The Atridae is the two Atreus brothers.

558
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,681
It's just plural for the Atreus brothers.

559
00:52:35,681 --> 00:52:38,480
So that's, again, Menelaus and Agamemnon.

560
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:43,120
The Atridae put forth from this shore the thousand ships of the Argoves.

561
00:52:43,121 --> 00:52:44,480
Well, guess what that is?

562
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,240
Those are the people of Argos.

563
00:52:46,241 --> 00:52:49,761
You ought to get so you could sort of decode it.

564
00:52:49,761 --> 00:53:01,240
And the strength and the armies, their cry of war went shrill from the heart, and now it begins to get into a real murky aeschylus, which is fascinating once you get used to it.

565
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:08,041
Okay, well, the cry of war went shrill from the heart as eagles stricken in agony for young perished.

566
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,801
Well, this is the metaphor.

567
00:53:09,801 --> 00:53:11,081
That's the as.

568
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,160
Now he's using, or is it a simile?

569
00:53:13,161 --> 00:53:14,600
Simile, I think, right?

570
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:15,960
Yeah, a simile.

571
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:20,921
So these warriors went out like, that's the simile, eagles.

572
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,680
Now what happens to these eagles?

573
00:53:22,681 --> 00:53:31,961
Stricken in agony for young perished, high from the nest, eddy and circle to bend and sweep of the wing stroke, lost far below the fledglings, the nest, and the tendons.

574
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:32,760
Wow.

575
00:53:32,761 --> 00:53:47,481
Well, it's like how eagles behave when they've left their nest, and while they were gone, something bad happened, and it killed the young eagles in the nest.

576
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:53,880
And those were the fledglings in the nest, the tendons, I take it, what the eagles were tending.

577
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:58,360
And that's just the way eagles would be upset.

578
00:53:58,761 --> 00:54:08,360
But it's no accident that this simile is about something that happened, so to speak, in the nest of Menelaus and Agamemnon.

579
00:54:08,681 --> 00:54:12,441
And of course, that is, Helen ran off.

580
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:24,201
And so it's not an accident that the eagles, who are Menelaus and Agamemnon, are all upset because something happened and it happened, so to speak, at home.

581
00:54:24,201 --> 00:54:25,800
Something bad happened at home.

582
00:54:25,801 --> 00:54:27,400
That's what's happening now.

583
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:35,961
Okay, now, yet someone hears in the air, a god, Apollo, Pan, or Zeus.

584
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:44,761
If anybody can tell me in office hours, not now, what Pan is doing in there, who's not part of the pantheon, that's a kind of pun.

585
00:54:45,201 --> 00:54:56,321
Pantheon just means across all the gods, like panachronic, panchromatic film used to mean film that was sensitive to all colors.

586
00:54:56,641 --> 00:55:04,400
So this Pan is the god of, you know, sort of he just plays the pan pipes and dances around in the woods as far as I know.

587
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:23,281
I don't know how he got in there with these heavies, but in the air, a god, Apollo, Pan, or Zeus, the high thin, hears, hears the high, thin wail of these guests, these sky guests, and drives late to the mark the fury upon the transgressors.

588
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:42,641
That is, the gods in the pantheon, never mind pan in there, hear that there's been this offense against the home of Menelaus, really.

589
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:52,400
And now, now this is something you would be very confused about if only you knew enough to be confused about it.

590
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,920
But you don't know enough yet.

591
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,760
But I have to tell you that there are high gods and low gods.

592
00:55:57,761 --> 00:55:59,600
The pantheon is up on Olympus.

593
00:55:59,601 --> 00:56:00,560
It's in the sky.

594
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,001
It's the high gods.

595
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,200
The furies live under the ground in the dark.

596
00:56:05,201 --> 00:56:08,161
We'll talk more about that next time, why that's the case.

597
00:56:08,161 --> 00:56:14,320
But who's in charge of getting this war off the ground?

598
00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:17,441
Well, that's a complicated story.

599
00:56:17,761 --> 00:56:27,121
But roughly, the pantheon gods are the gods of oath, that is, of promises that you keep.

600
00:56:27,761 --> 00:56:34,841
And the furies, they are described sometimes as curses.

601
00:56:34,841 --> 00:56:39,561
They are this mood of anger and vengeance.

602
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:49,000
Now, what's happened is that oddly enough, And this is really early, because I have to tell you this, but I can't help it, Aeschylus puts it in early.

603
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:59,481
I mean, what's odd is that something has happened that upsets both the furies because the family has been violated, and the furies defend the family.

604
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:12,200
And it upsets the sky gods because an oath has been violated, and that is the promise that, well, no, no, I cancel that.

605
00:57:12,201 --> 00:57:19,721
It upsets the sky gods because guests have broken the rule of guests.

606
00:57:20,601 --> 00:57:25,400
And Zeus is still in the guest protecting business.

607
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:29,160
Only oddly enough, very interesting, guess what?

608
00:57:29,161 --> 00:57:38,360
Zeus is now in the job of protecting the host from the guest, whereas he was before in the job of protecting the guests.

609
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:38,841
Why?

610
00:57:38,841 --> 00:57:48,281
Because it's not a polytheistic book, and you're not going from world to world anymore, and there's nothing specially interesting to be protected about guests and strangers.

611
00:57:48,281 --> 00:57:59,721
Now, it's sort of a world more like ours, in which there are families, and Zeus is protecting these families from bad guests.

612
00:57:59,721 --> 00:58:03,161
A very bad guest has just done a very bad thing.

613
00:58:03,161 --> 00:58:24,801
Paris has run off with Helen, and that offends both the furies who are protectors of families, and in a way that's sort of different, offends the sky gods who have principles that say you mustn't do bad things to the host.

614
00:58:24,801 --> 00:58:27,201
And so they're all upset.

615
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,801
I mean, don't worry about that now.

616
00:58:28,801 --> 00:58:34,560
I mean, we'll get that sorted out later, but I have to tell you that now, and we'll tell you that again.

617
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:44,481
So drive Zeus, the great guest god, that is the offender of families against bad guests.

618
00:58:45,281 --> 00:58:51,120
The Atridae, remember who they are, the Atreus brothers, against Alexander.

619
00:58:51,121 --> 00:58:52,961
Guess who Alexander is?

620
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:56,561
No reason you should know, but you can solve it like a crossword puzzle.

621
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,801
Alexander must be Paris, and it is.

622
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:01,041
That's another name for Paris.

623
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,441
Against Alexander for one woman's promiscuous sake.

624
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,240
He's not such a fan of Helen's anymore, you notice.

625
00:59:08,241 --> 00:59:14,400
I tried to see if that was really true in the Greek, and as far as I can tell, looking at two other translations, yes.

626
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:23,681
That is, it's just not a culture anymore that thinks that if you run off in a mood of erotic attraction, you're a great, peerless woman.

627
00:59:23,681 --> 00:59:27,601
It just thinks that Helen should have stayed faithful to Menelaus.

628
00:59:27,601 --> 00:59:37,600
But so for one woman's promiscuous sake, the struggling masses now comes the war, legs tired, knees grinding in the dust, arms, spears broken on the onset.

629
00:59:37,601 --> 00:59:40,641
Danans, another word for Greeks.

630
00:59:40,641 --> 00:59:42,961
I don't know where that one comes from.

631
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,880
And Trojans, you know who they are.

632
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:45,920
They have it alike.

633
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:49,681
That is, they're going at it in this big battle.

634
00:59:49,681 --> 00:59:53,201
And it goes as it goes, and so forth.

635
00:59:53,201 --> 00:59:56,281
Now I'm going to skip for a while.

636
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,641
Where is the...

637
00:59:57,681 --> 00:59:58,960
Okay, we can skip even.

638
00:59:59,201 --> 01:00:01,240
Yeah, now we're on 38.

639
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:08,200
The chorus can skip around because the chorus is describing stuff that's already happened.

640
01:00:08,201 --> 01:00:11,161
So you don't have to describe all the intervening events.

641
01:00:11,161 --> 01:00:23,081
What happened was that Menelaus and Agamemnon started out in a war to defend their nest, so to speak, their home, like eagles.

642
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:26,041
And now comes a weird thing.

643
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:34,041
While they're waiting to get off the shore of Argos and go to Troy, real eagles show up.

644
01:00:34,841 --> 01:00:39,721
The simile becomes literal, the middle of page 38.

645
01:00:40,601 --> 01:01:00,761
The chorus is going to say, they're going to tell how the wild bird portent hurled forth the Achaeans, twin-stem power, single-hearted lord of the youth of Hellas, another word for Greece, a lot of words for Greece, with spear and hand of strength to the land of Troikus.

646
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:04,600
And Troikris is the first king of Troy.

647
01:01:04,601 --> 01:01:05,960
That's what Troy is named after.

648
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:09,241
You see, it's again a crossword puzzle if you can figure it out.

649
01:01:09,241 --> 01:01:11,801
So that is another word for Troy.

650
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:12,841
Now about eagles.

651
01:01:12,841 --> 01:01:20,520
King of birds to the king of the ships, one black, one blazed with silver, clear seen by the royal house, that is, the royal brothers.

652
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:24,841
On the right hand, that's got something to do with the way birds predict things.

653
01:01:24,841 --> 01:01:29,001
The spear hand means that, you know, it's got to do with going to war.

654
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:41,721
They lighted the two eagles, watched by all, tore a hair ripe, bursting with young, unborn yet, stayed from her fast fleet running, sorrow, sorrow, but good went out in the end.

655
01:01:41,721 --> 01:02:00,240
So now the eagles, instead of having their home violated in the simile, the eagles show up and they do this bad thing of taking, of attacking this poor rabbit and killing it and eating the baby rabbits.

656
01:02:00,241 --> 01:02:07,281
This is not going to make certain people happy, particularly Artemis, who loves cuddly things.

657
01:02:07,281 --> 01:02:08,961
So we've got to go on.

658
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:13,681
Then the grave seer of the host saw through to the hearts divided.

659
01:02:13,681 --> 01:02:22,321
That is, he saw that the eagles were the Atreus brothers, Agamemnon and Menelaus, knew the fighting sons of Atreus feeding on the hare.

660
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:24,000
You see how weird it is.

661
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:29,761
I mean, so the eagles are feeding on the hare, but the eagles are really the symbols represent the two kings.

662
01:02:29,761 --> 01:02:31,921
So the kings are feeding on the hare.

663
01:02:32,241 --> 01:02:39,201
And so fighting sons of Atreus feeding on the hare with the host, their people, seeing beyond, that is, the seer sees.

664
01:02:39,201 --> 01:02:45,681
With time, this foray shall stalk the castle of Prime, and so forth and so forth.

665
01:02:46,321 --> 01:02:48,321
I don't think I need to read her.

666
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,120
Okay, five lines down now on 39.

667
01:02:51,121 --> 01:02:55,921
I'm still trying to unscramble the whole plot that's condensed in here.

668
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,081
Now, I mentioned Artemis.

669
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:02,561
Artemis is already in the pantheon, but I never mention her.

670
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:07,601
But she's a young goddess, virgin goddess of the hunt.

671
01:03:07,601 --> 01:03:18,480
She loves animals, and she is, and she probably had a pet rabbit at some point, and she's very unhappy.

672
01:03:18,641 --> 01:03:21,761
I'm sure she doesn't eat rabbit anymore for dinner.

673
01:03:21,761 --> 01:03:26,721
And she's very unhappy about what's going on with the hare.

674
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:33,161
So Artemis, the undefiled, is angry with pity at the flying hounds of her father.

675
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:35,880
That is, she's unhappy about Zeus's eagles.

676
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:47,960
Eating the she's unhappy that the hounds of her father, the flying hounds, that makes them eagles, eating, she's unhappy that they're eating the unborn young and the hare and the shivering mother.

677
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:52,200
She was thick at the eagles' feastings, sorrow, sorrow, but good went out in the end.

678
01:03:52,201 --> 01:03:54,601
That's the moral of the play that keeps coming back.

679
01:03:54,601 --> 01:04:00,761
Lots of suffering has to be going on before bad things in the culture get fixed.

680
01:04:00,761 --> 01:04:07,481
Think again of how African Americans were treated or how women were treated and still maybe are being treated.

681
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:11,081
The culture is trying to fix it, but it takes a lot of suffering.

682
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,680
Lovely you are.

683
01:04:12,681 --> 01:04:13,720
Maybe I'm going on again.

684
01:04:13,721 --> 01:04:18,120
Lovely you are and kind to the tender young of ravening lions.

685
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:26,921
Now, Artemis is a very sensitive, feeling young woman, but she doesn't think very clearly the way this play is set up.

686
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:35,641
And she loves the tender baby, cuddly babies, even the cuddly babies of lions.

687
01:04:35,641 --> 01:04:41,400
I mean, she loves all animals, but particularly little cuddly, young ones.

688
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:45,240
But that's a bad thing to do because look what happens.

689
01:04:45,241 --> 01:04:50,120
For the suckling of all the savage beasts that work in the lonely places, you have sympathy.

690
01:04:50,121 --> 01:04:54,841
Yes, grant these meanings, meaning to these appearances, but not without evil.

691
01:04:54,841 --> 01:05:05,960
Healer, Apollo, I pray you, let her not, we're going to hear more about that in a minute, with crosswinds, blind the ships of the Danes, to time-long anchorage.

692
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:06,760
Stop there.

693
01:05:06,761 --> 01:05:11,241
I'm going to go off on a sidetrack for a minute to page 57.

694
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:16,640
Because I told you that Artemis has beautiful feelings, but she doesn't think very clearly.

695
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:22,640
The chorus says that on 57 when they say this, that's the second paragraph.

696
01:05:22,641 --> 01:05:28,720
Once a man fostered in his house a lion cub from the mother's milk torn, craving the beast given.

697
01:05:28,721 --> 01:05:29,520
What is that?

698
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,641
Torn.

699
01:05:30,641 --> 01:05:32,400
Carbon.

700
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,920
The breast instead of the beast.

701
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:34,560
That's what.

702
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:35,841
Craving the breast given.

703
01:05:35,841 --> 01:05:37,040
Okay, now I can read.

704
01:05:37,281 --> 01:05:41,120
In the first steps of its young life, mild, it played with children.

705
01:05:41,121 --> 01:05:43,121
This is the little lion cub.

706
01:05:43,281 --> 01:05:44,560
And delighted the old.

707
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:48,160
Caught in the arms cradle, they pampered it like a newborn child and so forth.

708
01:05:48,161 --> 01:05:53,201
But it grew in time, and the lion in the blood stain came out.

709
01:05:53,201 --> 01:06:00,160
It paid grace to those who had fostered it in blood and death to the sheep flocks, its grim beast forbidden.

710
01:06:00,161 --> 01:06:04,561
So, in other words, the lion grew up and it killed everybody.

711
01:06:05,201 --> 01:06:14,400
And there's something inconsistent about Artemis who loves all these tender babies who can grow up and be dangerous.

712
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,601
We have to put that on back burner for a moment.

713
01:06:17,601 --> 01:06:35,841
Now, what they're worried about is that Artemis will get so upset that the eagles are eating the baby bunnies that she's going to do something which is going to cause a lot of trouble, but we only hear about it now.

714
01:06:36,161 --> 01:06:48,960
Let her not, we're in the middle of 39, with crosswinds bind the ships of the Daians to the time-long anchorage, forcing a second sacrifice, unholy, untasted, working bitterness in the blood.

715
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:52,080
Well, that's something that's going to happen.

716
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:57,920
And the, and now I just tell you a sort of plot-wise thing, I think.

717
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,841
I don't think I want to read anymore.

718
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:14,841
What's happening on the next pages is that Artemis says that she won't let the Atridae get their fleet, an army, off to Troy.

719
01:07:14,841 --> 01:07:18,360
unless Agamemnon kills his daughter.

720
01:07:18,361 --> 01:07:28,600
Now, how that's connected with the eagles eating the rabbit bunnies is very complicated, but I think I can explain it.

721
01:07:28,601 --> 01:07:39,880
I mean, what happens is she sees that the war is going to cause a lot more young people to be killed.

722
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:42,920
And she wants to stop the war.

723
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:58,520
And that is, she wants to stop the eagles feasting on the rabbits, means she wants to stop Agamemnon and Menelaus drafting all these young people from Greece and going off and getting lots of them killed, most of them finally, in Troy.

724
01:07:58,521 --> 01:08:00,280
And how does she do it?

725
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:08,280
Well, she does it by saying Agamemnon can't send these people off to war unless he sacrifices his daughter.

726
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:13,640
Now, for years, I found that completely crazy.

727
01:08:13,641 --> 01:08:14,920
Why that?

728
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:16,920
Why does she do that?

729
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:27,480
Well, a colleague of mine who now just recently died in a book called Agamemnon and Other Losers, which is a great idea for a book, explains it.

730
01:08:27,481 --> 01:08:37,240
And what he says is that what Artemis is thinking is that Agamemnon hasn't the right to draft these young people and send them off to wherever.

731
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:39,801
Right now it's Iraq, but it could be wherever.

732
01:08:39,801 --> 01:08:54,160
And if he's not willing to send his own son or daughter, that is, kings who are ready to send everybody else to sacrifice and presidents too, shouldn't be able to do that unless they're willing to make the same sort of sacrifice.

733
01:08:54,160 --> 01:09:01,601
That means Agamemnon had better be ready to kill his daughter or he won't get his fleet off to Greece.

734
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,480
Now comes the second thing.

735
01:09:05,761 --> 01:09:08,481
Tussman, my colleague, really solved that one, I think.

736
01:09:08,481 --> 01:09:10,240
That must be how it is.

737
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:28,480
But then I thought, well, that's very smart, but what a crazy thing to think that because they are going to hurt a lot of young, innocent people with this war, she wants to kill one more young, innocent person, poor Iphigenia.

738
01:09:28,481 --> 01:09:30,640
That's even crazier.

739
01:09:30,641 --> 01:09:33,120
Well, she doesn't think very clearly.

740
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:40,480
And here's what's happening: she thinks that if she makes this threat, Agamemnon will go home.

741
01:09:40,481 --> 01:09:44,240
And won't, I mean, why would anybody go and kill their own daughter?

742
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:45,841
He loves this daughter.

743
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:51,761
So all we have to do is say that he has to either sacrifice the daughter or give up this stupid war.

744
01:09:51,761 --> 01:09:55,120
And the answer will be he'll go home and give up the stupid war.

745
01:09:55,120 --> 01:10:12,640
But of course, that doesn't work because what Artemis, who is all tenderness and feeling, doesn't understand is that there's another whole dimension of values in the culture, of oaths and honor, and not doing terrible things to your host.

746
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:16,641
And it doesn't say it here, but they all know, and you can find out.

747
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:24,721
Agamemnon has sworn an oath to Menelaus that if anybody does anything bad to him, he will come to his defense and vice versa.

748
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:35,960
So Agamemnon, by an oath, is bound to support the values of the pantheon anyway, namely protecting hosts from guests.

749
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:38,520
So he's got to kill his daughter.

750
01:10:38,761 --> 01:10:45,160
The threat from the life of Ephigenia by Artemis is going to backfire.

751
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,960
It's just going to add one more innocent person.

752
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,641
And now we've gotten to where I can stop.

753
01:10:49,641 --> 01:10:50,360
It's just fine.

754
01:10:50,361 --> 01:10:57,240
But I just want to tell you, now read the Agamemnon, but I've got you to the point where poor Agamemnon is in a terrible situation.

755
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:58,920
I just want to make it clear.

756
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:03,801
If he doesn't kill Ephigenia, he doesn't do his job as king.

757
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:05,560
He doesn't keep his promise.

758
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:08,601
He doesn't support the side of Zeus.

759
01:11:08,601 --> 01:11:10,841
And that's terrifically bad.

760
01:11:10,841 --> 01:11:16,920
However, if he kills his daughter, he offends the people who defend young people.

761
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:20,040
He's going to get in trouble with Clytemnestra, his wife.

762
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,080
It's a disaster.

763
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:22,200
And he loves her.

764
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:25,160
So Agamemnon is in a hopeless situation.

765
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:26,600
Wait and see what he does.
