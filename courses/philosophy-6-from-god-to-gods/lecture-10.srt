1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,240
We stopped last time just at the point where, if I hadn't run out of time, I would have liked to get a tiny bit further because the ending is such fun, if you can consider all this suffering fun.

2
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:24,280
That is, it's interesting that it looks like there's going to be a happy ending.

3
00:00:24,281 --> 00:00:28,200
I mean, I'll go back one little step so that you know where we are.

4
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:40,681
Remember that they're having this debate because Orestes has asked Pylades what to do and to do it for the sake of whom the Furies or Apollo.

5
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:52,360
And Pylades says, as he naturally would, being a complete detached stranger spectator, the one sentence he has is: do it for the new gods, do it for Apollo.

6
00:00:52,360 --> 00:01:24,441
So that so Orestes has to, at the last minute, shift out of the emotional outrage that he's worked himself up into to even consider splitting his mother's throat into a kind of cold logical frame of mind in which he's got to prove to himself and his mother that it is the right thing, meaning the necessary logical thing to do, that he kills her.

7
00:01:24,441 --> 00:01:32,601
The right thing is, of course, all up for grabs, depending on all these other issues about what counts as right.

8
00:01:32,601 --> 00:01:42,441
But whatever it is, he's got to work himself up into giving a logical defense, which means it's Apollo right thing, to kill his mother.

9
00:01:42,441 --> 00:01:44,761
And they have this great debate.

10
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:56,080
By the way, I was telling the TAs three years ago, the Berkeley Rep people did the Orestea, and they obviously didn't understand what was going on.

11
00:01:56,561 --> 00:02:06,321
And they felt that, of course, if he's working himself up to kill his mother, he must be getting more and more excited and frantic, and she must be getting more and more excited and frantic.

12
00:02:06,321 --> 00:02:19,920
So they were yelling these logical lines: if this, if then, and counterexamples, and if and things like this one, which is where the last one, where she says, Take care, your mother's curse, like dogs will drag you down.

13
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,761
She screams at him in this version, and he says, How shall I escape my father's curse if I fail here?

14
00:02:25,761 --> 00:02:28,481
But that's not the kind of screaming thing.

15
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,761
That's a debate.

16
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:35,521
He's saying, Well, if you want to discuss it on the level of fate and say, You couldn't help what you did, it was fate.

17
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,281
Then I can't help what I'm doing.

18
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,640
That's fate, too.

19
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,561
And that's the whole way it is.

20
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:46,640
He's become completely cold and logical, and he's done it for Apollo.

21
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,601
And now what's going to happen?

22
00:02:49,601 --> 00:02:51,200
That's the question.

23
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:53,121
Well, one more line.

24
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:56,721
I said it, but I said it so fast that I'm afraid you missed it.

25
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,121
And the translation would get you way off track.

26
00:02:59,121 --> 00:03:08,321
At the bottom of 126, Orestes says that indeed the terror of your green saw things to come clearly.

27
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:15,761
And she says, oh, clear, CCL, he says, you killed and it was wrong, now suffer wrong.

28
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:21,360
Now that can't be right because he doesn't think what he's doing is wrong.

29
00:03:21,361 --> 00:03:29,041
He thinks that what he's doing is logically justified of killing his, killing the woman who killed his father.

30
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,521
And the translation is wrong.

31
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,160
It says, you did it.

32
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,881
The Greek says, as far as I can tell reading other translations, you did a terrible thing, now suffer a terrible thing.

33
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,840
That's okay.

34
00:03:41,481 --> 00:03:49,480
And so he does it for impersonal reasons.

35
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:59,480
A student, I think last time, somebody here asked, what does it mean in the middle of 126 to say it will be you who kill yourself, not I?

36
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:03,321
I sort of messed that up.

37
00:04:03,321 --> 00:04:06,441
I forget what I said, but it wasn't altogether wrong.

38
00:04:06,441 --> 00:04:11,561
I said somehow it's fate and what you did that requires me to kill you.

39
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:12,361
That's right.

40
00:04:12,361 --> 00:04:20,121
But the right thing to say is he's become identified in his mind with cold, impartial justice.

41
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:27,881
And so he's saying it will, that is, it amounts to saying, I'm just an agent.

42
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:29,801
I'm just an executioner.

43
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,520
I've got no emotional involvement in this thing.

44
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:40,681
It's all your fault that you got into it, and I'm just standing by and executing the results.

45
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:49,480
I mean, he's trying to make himself as cold, impartial, and impersonal as he can as he does it.

46
00:04:49,881 --> 00:04:52,280
And so much for that.

47
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,520
Now let's go.

48
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,401
Now we're going on.

49
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,920
That was from last time.

50
00:04:57,481 --> 00:05:04,120
Now comes, and this is where I would have started ended, the seeming happy ending.

51
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,881
As I say, this play is full of reversals, but I didn't get a chance to talk about this reversal.

52
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:12,280
It looks like it's happened.

53
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:30,960
I just described to you the way the killing looks to her and to him as if he did it with cold, impartial, Apollonian justice, and now the curse should be over.

54
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:41,761
He didn't perpetuate the fury-motivated killings that have been going on in the house of Atreus for three generations into the next generation.

55
00:05:41,761 --> 00:05:42,960
He stopped it.

56
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,521
And that's what the chorus thinks, and that's what he thinks.

57
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,040
And everybody's happy.

58
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:52,080
This is the happy ending on 127, bottom of the page.

59
00:05:52,080 --> 00:06:08,640
All that Luxius, you know who that is by now, Apollo, who on Parnassus holds the huge and deep cleft in the ground, shrilled aloud by guile that is no guile, returns now to assault the wrong done and growing old.

60
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,561
This is going to need a lot of explaining.

61
00:06:10,561 --> 00:06:18,960
Divinity keeps, we know not how, strength to resist the power of the strength to resist surrender to the wicked.

62
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,801
That means, all of this means, look, Apollo's doing it right.

63
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:25,041
It's done out in the open.

64
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,441
It's done in a fair debate.

65
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:30,640
And we're resisting these bad guys.

66
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,801
The power that holds the sky's majesty wins our worship.

67
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,161
Apollo won.

68
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,681
Light is here to behold Apollo again.

69
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:43,281
The big bit that held our house is taken away.

70
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:51,761
Remember the bit goes back to the bit they kept had on Ephigenia to keep her from cursing Agamemnon when he killed her.

71
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:57,280
But then Clytemnestra says that she killed Agamemnon in the name of Ephigenia's furies.

72
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:05,041
So there's still curses going on, even though people are trying to muzzle them, they're there.

73
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,001
But when what is it to have the bit taken away?

74
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:10,441
Well, that's that logic I was talking about.

75
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:15,800
She gets to state her case out in the open, giving all the arguments for her position.

76
00:07:15,961 --> 00:07:18,521
It's like a law trial.

77
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,561
He gets to, she's the defense.

78
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,281
The prosecution, which is him, gets to refute all of her arguments.

79
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,721
Nothing is kept secret, and she loses.

80
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,361
And then the big bit is taken away.

81
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:37,241
It's not a question of underground seething resentments and revenges.

82
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:41,721
It's a murder, and the murderer has to pay for it.

83
00:07:42,121 --> 00:07:43,560
And I want to say one more thing.

84
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,961
I don't remember whether I said it last time or not.

85
00:07:45,961 --> 00:08:06,520
There's a kind of bump in the story that Aeschylus can't fix, namely that Apollo, who for him is one of the sky gods, the god of light, the god of everything out in the open, has a priestess who lives in a cave underground, and that's a bit embarrassing, but he can't get rid of it.

86
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:15,241
So he says it, Luxius, who on Parnassus holds the huge and deep cleft in the ground and so forth.

87
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:22,121
And he tries to cancel this unfortunate thing in the next paragraph when he says light is here to behold.

88
00:08:22,121 --> 00:08:25,881
He doesn't say, look, it's secret, it's dark, it's hidden, it's underground.

89
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:28,681
He just treats it as if it was out in the open.

90
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,201
And it's just a fact that they had this cave.

91
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:35,080
Any of you probably don't have time to listen to NPR.

92
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,640
There was just a big discussion of Apollo's priestess.

93
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,921
Did anybody hear it?

94
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:55,680
There's that hole in the ground happens to be a case where psychedelic g gases come out and the priestesses were all drunk, you know, not with alcohol, but that stoned out of their minds, and then they made these amazing predictions.

95
00:08:56,001 --> 00:09:06,081
And it had to be there, because that's where two different channels of sort of laughing gas or whatever it was out of the ground come together.

96
00:09:06,081 --> 00:09:10,481
But that's all something Aeschylus either doesn't know about or doesn't care about.

97
00:09:10,481 --> 00:09:14,321
What matters is that Apollo won.

98
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,361
And that and that so we go on.

99
00:09:17,361 --> 00:09:20,560
Anybody, nobody wants to, I don't think there's anything to say about any of this yet.

100
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,041
Oh, there is.

101
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,160
Go ahead.

102
00:09:23,441 --> 00:09:24,801
That's right.

103
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,521
Yeah.

104
00:09:25,841 --> 00:09:27,840
But the priestess seemed to live underground.

105
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:36,080
At least, I mean, I'm only worrying about, says the huge, the Alexias who won Parnassus holes, the deep cleft in the ground.

106
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,281
Well, maybe not.

107
00:09:38,081 --> 00:09:38,961
Okay, good.

108
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:40,561
Beatrice makes it even better.

109
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:50,881
It isn't, there is this hole in the ground where the gases are, and they go down there, presumably, when they want to get into this trance, or the gas comes up and they get into the trance, Beatrice says.

110
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:51,920
And that's fine.

111
00:09:51,920 --> 00:10:01,361
That's better, because the less we hear about Apollo being underground, in the dark, and so forth, or his priestess being there, is better.

112
00:10:01,361 --> 00:10:05,601
Okay, but he has to mention it here and then just cancel it and drop it.

113
00:10:05,601 --> 00:10:07,441
And we'll just cancel it and drop it.

114
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,841
Don't bother to even take notes about it.

115
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:15,761
It's not going to turn out to be important that his priestess is, wherever his priestess is.

116
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,320
What's important is that Apollo won out.

117
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,681
Clytemnestra stated her case and lost every round.

118
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,640
And we don't need to prevent any curses anymore.

119
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,560
She can't, she can't, she doesn't curse him as she dies, as I recall.

120
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:37,441
I hope not, because she just, it's all on the level of logic, and she had a chance to say her whole defense, and it was refuted.

121
00:10:37,441 --> 00:10:41,640
So there's no place for secrecy in curses anymore, I think.

122
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:51,321
It was done with the hot passion, motivated him up to the last moment, and it motivated him then into icy reason.

123
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,361
And that's just what should have happened.

124
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:57,081
That's just what they hoped for at the beginning of the play.

125
00:10:57,081 --> 00:11:00,041
But who would have thought that anybody could have brought it off?

126
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,281
Aeschylus has to use this trick of Pylades to get it to bring it off.

127
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:10,121
But on page 98, you hear at the very beginning what the chorus hopes will happen.

128
00:11:10,121 --> 00:11:14,121
And it turns out, it's exactly what seems to have happened at the time.

129
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:14,921
It really did happen.

130
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:15,640
What really happened?

131
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,761
Never mind the scenes, too.

132
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:24,280
At the top of the page, Orestes is saying, I think, or Electra, it doesn't matter who's saying it, they all are agreeing to it.

133
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:33,161
Electra is saying, grant that I, Electra, be more temperate of heart than my mother, that I act with purer hands.

134
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,080
Such are my prayers for us.

135
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,361
So Orestes, too, then needs to be temperate and pure.

136
00:11:38,361 --> 00:11:44,840
But for our enemies, Father, I pray that your Avenger come, that they who killed shall be killed in turn as they deserve.

137
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,761
Well, she's on both sides, the Avenger of the Furies.

138
00:11:48,761 --> 00:11:56,040
But what actually happened is that Orestes did it temperate and with pure hand, I take it.

139
00:11:56,601 --> 00:11:59,801
And that's why it looks like a happy ending.

140
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:08,761
It looks like a happy ending, and now at the top of 128, this is the statement of the happy ending.

141
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:10,600
Time brings all things to pass.

142
00:12:10,601 --> 00:12:13,321
Presently time shall cross the outgates of the house.

143
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:20,121
After the stain is driven entirely from the hearth, by ceremonies washed clean, and cast out the furies.

144
00:12:20,121 --> 00:12:28,161
The dice of fortune shall be thrown once more and lie in a fair, false, smiling up to the new indwellers come to live in the house.

145
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:31,441
The curse is gone from the house of Atreus, they say.

146
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,640
And what could be a happier ending?

147
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:42,081
And he comes out, then Orestes, and shows them the net.

148
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,841
This is still part of the sort of forensic legal thing.

149
00:12:45,841 --> 00:12:55,601
It's a little odd that you show the murder weapon after you've already executed the criminal, but it's not, but he's showing that he did the right thing.

150
00:12:55,601 --> 00:13:03,521
Here's the murder weapon on page 128, a line about 985.

151
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:05,361
No, more 980.

152
00:13:05,361 --> 00:13:18,400
Behold, oh, Ottis, behold, O audience, of these evil things, the engine against my wretched father, they devised.

153
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:25,521
The hands entanglement, they tangled him up in this net in the bath, and then they stabbed him when he couldn't get out and defend himself.

154
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:31,281
And so he lays it out, and he says, it's a net who caught a man.

155
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,041
I think that's correcting his father.

156
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,800
He's not supposed to kill her, remember, because she killed his father.

157
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,681
That would be, you've got to keep your eye on that all the time.

158
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:50,081
Every time it looks like he killed her because she killed his father, it's either a mistake in the translation or a mistake in my reading.

159
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,201
And I'll show you several mistakes that are in the translation.

160
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:56,001
It's up to you to show me mistakes that are in my reading.

161
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,201
He's supposed to do it because she killed a man and because she killed a man of high renown.

162
00:14:01,201 --> 00:14:02,881
That is, she killed a king.

163
00:14:02,881 --> 00:14:05,361
He's not supposed to, that's all logical.

164
00:14:05,361 --> 00:14:06,480
Anybody could have done it.

165
00:14:06,481 --> 00:14:08,560
That's what I mean by doing it impersonally.

166
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,640
He's not supposed to kill her because she killed his father.

167
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,881
So then he says, and so he switches.

168
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:35,640
So the net that caught a man, then so shall not my father, but he's going to cancel father, but that great father who sees all, the son, that's Apollo, look on my mother's sacrilegious handiwork and be a witness for me in my day of trial, how it was right that I achieved this death, my mother's, for against this death I take no account.

169
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,601
Nobody cares.

170
00:14:36,601 --> 00:14:37,800
It's in a play.

171
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,081
He had a seducer's punishment no more than law.

172
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,520
So that's the happy ending.

173
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:46,681
He lays out the evidence.

174
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:53,001
He cleans up his act and makes clear that he did it because of the bad man, not because of his father.

175
00:14:53,001 --> 00:15:05,961
And it looks like, all by himself, he's freed the house of Atreus from the narrow alternatives of the destructive background practices of the culture.

176
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:38,280
That he, at least for himself and maybe for everybody, has saved them from this mess that they're in, in which the Furies and Apollo are always fighting, or to put it now in less mythical terms, in which the culture always has emotional vengeance reasons for doing things and rational logical reasons for not doing them, and everybody's caught in the crossfire, or sometimes it has logical reasons for doing things, but they conflict always with the emotional reasons, I presume, for not doing things.

177
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:46,040
But there's always this emotion-reason, conflict, but it looks like, single-handed, he's stopped it.

178
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,880
Now, do you see that that can't be right, that are the story I'm telling.

179
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,081
There's something wrong somewhere.

180
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,241
Why would this be not something that Aeschylus would possibly consider?

181
00:15:54,681 --> 00:15:58,160
Can you tell?

182
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,761
Can an individual person, by having the right motives, fix the culture?

183
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,161
It's just a phenomenological question.

184
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,560
I mean, it's not a question about Aeschylus.

185
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,481
It's anybody ought to be able to tell.

186
00:16:10,481 --> 00:16:11,600
Could you?

187
00:16:12,241 --> 00:16:12,880
No.

188
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:19,840
I mean, it takes time, it takes suffering, it takes lots of doing to change the values of the culture.

189
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,360
That's what the play is about, and there's still an act and a half to go.

190
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,040
So there must have been something wrong with what I said.

191
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,440
Well, we'll see what's wrong with what I said.

192
00:16:29,441 --> 00:16:43,520
What's wrong with what I said is right after the speech where Orestes claims that he's made it all okay now, he killed her in the right way, and everything is fine, he starts to crack up.

193
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:50,001
In the middle of 995, the chorus says, I think I don't need to read anything of that.

194
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:52,481
Yeah, starting with the chorus, ah, but the pitiful work.

195
00:16:52,481 --> 00:16:53,201
This is the chorus.

196
00:16:53,201 --> 00:16:55,200
Dismal the death that was your ending.

197
00:16:55,201 --> 00:16:58,400
He has left alive paying flowers for him.

198
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:01,761
So dismal the death of Clytemnestra, that doesn't matter.

199
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:02,961
Good riddance.

200
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:05,201
But what's happening to poor Orestes?

201
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:12,481
He looked like he had just, you know, single-handedly saved the culture, and now it looks like he's in deep trouble.

202
00:17:12,481 --> 00:17:14,560
Yeah, he's certainly in deep trouble.

203
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,120
He's in trouble because he's going crazy.

204
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,800
And he's not just going crazy in any old arbitrary way.

205
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,520
He's going crazy in a way that makes perfect sense.

206
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,560
In the next speech at the end, I'll just go to the very end.

207
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,200
I grieve for the thing done, the death of all our race.

208
00:17:35,201 --> 00:17:36,320
I have won.

209
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,080
That's what we just heard.

210
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,120
He did win.

211
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,441
He did it right.

212
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,640
But my victory is soiled and has no pride.

213
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:45,001
Well, why?

214
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:47,001
I mean, why is he cracking up?

215
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:49,400
Why didn't he just win?

216
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,241
Is he guilty of having done something wrong?

217
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,320
No.

218
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,160
That's a trick question.

219
00:17:57,161 --> 00:17:57,881
No, he's not.

220
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,001
He did it right.

221
00:17:59,001 --> 00:18:01,400
He exactly did what had to be done.

222
00:18:01,401 --> 00:18:13,001
He killed the Clytemnestra, who had killed his father, who had killed a man of high degree, who had let herself be seduced by the brother and all of that.

223
00:18:13,641 --> 00:18:19,640
She was definitely to be killed, and he did it, and he did it in the right frame of mind for the sake of Apollo.

224
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,160
So what's happening?

225
00:18:21,161 --> 00:18:23,320
Well, he's not guilty.

226
00:18:23,481 --> 00:18:29,320
Aeschylus is very subtle and clear about this, but he has tremendous guilt feelings.

227
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,401
There's a big difference between being guilty, which is a legal thing.

228
00:18:33,401 --> 00:18:43,800
And if you're guilty, you're guilty for all the crime, and there's nothing you can do about it except go to prison and expiate it, like Reskolnikov at the end of Crime and Punishment.

229
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:49,001
But if your problem is that you have guilt feelings, that's a whole different story.

230
00:18:49,641 --> 00:18:51,160
Picture the thing.

231
00:18:51,161 --> 00:18:52,761
Just really picture the thing.

232
00:18:52,761 --> 00:19:01,721
He slit his mother's throat face to face, a mother who he presumably loved up to the age of 11 when she sent him away, and maybe even afterward.

233
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:08,040
And once that's happened, you can't just walk off and say, well, hooray, now everything's done.

234
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,481
We fixed it.

235
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,920
And he can't.

236
00:19:11,241 --> 00:19:16,280
Yeah, that's easy, but I mean, well, hard maybe, but doable.

237
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,560
But a good question.

238
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,520
Suppose, I'm trying to explain it right now.

239
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:31,600
He's not guilty because he hasn't done anything wrong from Apollo's point of view, which is the legal point of view.

240
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:37,761
He has done what it was right to kill quite a mistress.

241
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:41,681
She deserved it for over-determined reasons.

242
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,200
A bad lady.

243
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:52,800
But it doesn't keep you from feeling terrible that you've done, as the translation, or my earth translation says, a terrible thing.

244
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,560
You feel the horror and the terribleness of slitting your mother's throat.

245
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:09,840
You feel that you've done something terribly wrong, even though you know that what you did was exactly right.

246
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:32,720
That's the feeling you could, and maybe not very often does anybody have it, but anybody who has to kill their mother because that's the proper legal thing to do and the God demanded it and helped isn't going to feel good about it because nobody can feel good about killing their mother.

247
00:20:32,721 --> 00:20:33,601
So that's it.

248
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,160
And it's very important, this distinction to Aeschylus.

249
00:20:36,241 --> 00:20:42,001
I'll jump ahead just to suppose because I see that people are looking somewhat incredulous.

250
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:47,120
Okay, the test is, one more thing, and then good, good, yes.

251
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,040
I was thinking a while back of Kaczynski.

252
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,960
You know, remember that maybe it's a little before your time, the Unabomber.

253
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:57,761
Were you conscious at the time of the Jungen bomber?

254
00:20:57,761 --> 00:20:59,681
So his brother turned him in.

255
00:20:59,681 --> 00:21:02,080
That was the necessary right thing to do.

256
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,680
He was a dangerous, mad criminal killing people.

257
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:09,241
But he must have felt terrible turning his brother in.

258
00:21:08,641 --> 00:21:12,440
And that's the kind of split you have in mind.

259
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:16,120
Yeah, okay, that's a helpful example.

260
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:21,160
But I'll give you also a kind of philosophical point that's related to it.

261
00:21:21,161 --> 00:21:25,400
Remember, I said that if you feel, if you're guilty, you're guilty forever.

262
00:21:26,441 --> 00:21:37,961
You can go and do your time in Siberia, like Reskolnikov, and that means you expiate your crime, but you're still, you still did something, and you're still guilty.

263
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:40,680
And in the United States, you're a felon forever, right?

264
00:21:40,681 --> 00:21:41,801
Once you're a felon.

265
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,481
They want to change that, I think.

266
00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:46,520
But right now, I believe that's how it is.

267
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:56,120
But if it's guilt feelings, and this is for you back in the corner, if it's guilt feelings, then gradually you'll get over them.

268
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:03,320
Because you'll begin to drift into the past how awful it looked when your mother's blood was all over you and so forth.

269
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,800
And you can get over guilt feelings.

270
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,160
And that's what happens.

271
00:22:07,481 --> 00:22:12,440
He gets over the guilt, which means it couldn't have been legal guilt.

272
00:22:12,681 --> 00:22:15,481
So let's go now and look at that.

273
00:22:15,481 --> 00:22:20,360
He's beginning to hallucinate on way back here.

274
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,241
So on 129, we still are.

275
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,400
This is what's happening to him.

276
00:22:25,401 --> 00:22:27,320
Now you just got to read a lot.

277
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:45,241
So I'm still reading on 129 because you've got to get used to this issue of why Orestes, who did it temperately, logically, purely, is now being pursued by these loathsome old ladies who are the furies, who are the forces of revenge.

278
00:22:45,241 --> 00:22:51,881
And so the chorus says, there is no mortal man who shall return unhurt, his life's course to the end, not marred.

279
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,040
There is trouble here, there's more to come.

280
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,640
And Orestes says, I would have you know, I see not how this thing will end.

281
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:03,520
I am a charioteer whose course is wrenched outside the track, and I am beaten.

282
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,481
My rebellious senses bolt with me headlong.

283
00:23:06,481 --> 00:23:08,880
I mean, that's a way of saying I'm going crazy.

284
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,040
It's not that anything objective is going wrong.

285
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,880
His senses, his brain, his perception is going wrong.

286
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:20,721
And so, let's see.

287
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,120
And the fear against my heart is ready for the singing and dance of wrath.

288
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,600
Wrath is always associated.

289
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:36,241
In Greek, it's atte, and that means the same kind of thing that Achilles had at the beginning of the Iliad.

290
00:23:36,241 --> 00:23:39,280
It means getting very angry and upset.

291
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,801
And that's how the furies are.

292
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,600
Wrath is always associated with the furies.

293
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,280
So I've got to stop here and tell you something.

294
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,080
I made my mind up to tell you at the beginning that I was too busy getting all the microphones and stuff.

295
00:23:52,080 --> 00:24:02,721
Students asked me in office hours, and I was worried myself about this talk about wrath with a capital W, what is the else?

296
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:08,961
Fury with a capital F, and justice with a capital J.

297
00:24:08,961 --> 00:24:17,280
And it even says in one place, whoever came, I think it was him maybe, to complain, that the daughter of Zeus is, was it you?

298
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,481
Was wrath?

299
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:23,280
It says on 41, and you thought maybe that was Athena because she's the daughter of Zeus.

300
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,241
But it's not.

301
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,801
It's not really the daughter of Zeus.

302
00:24:26,961 --> 00:24:31,040
That's just a metaphor, that Zeus being behind everything.

303
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:37,761
He's also behind wrath, justice, and what's the other one again?

304
00:24:38,721 --> 00:24:44,841
Now we've got DK, Ate, wrath, justice, and Fury.

305
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,641
Those are the three.

306
00:24:39,681 --> 00:24:47,001
Maybe I should just write them on the board.

307
00:24:47,641 --> 00:24:48,921
You shouldn't worry about this.

308
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:57,800
I'm telling you this so you won't worry about it, not so you will sort of pay attention to it or write it down or anything, because it doesn't lead anywhere.

309
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:04,920
But there is wrath, there's justice, and there's furies.

310
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:07,400
And there's a Greek word for each of these, Ate.

311
00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:08,200
I don't know how to spell it.

312
00:25:08,201 --> 00:25:11,320
Is that how do you spell it with an accent or something?

313
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,001
So I think something like that.

314
00:25:13,001 --> 00:25:15,080
Justice is DK, right?

315
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,800
Who, and Barry, how do you spell it?

316
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:24,040
D-I-K-E with a D-I-K-A-E.

317
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,001
Just E.

318
00:25:25,001 --> 00:25:26,280
Okay, DK.

319
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,921
And that's sometimes translated as fate, right?

320
00:25:29,241 --> 00:25:30,200
That's the same.

321
00:25:30,201 --> 00:25:30,761
Right.

322
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,040
No, that's another one.

323
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,441
Right.

324
00:25:32,441 --> 00:25:33,560
Okay, here's another one.

325
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,280
Right.

326
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:35,481
Oh, that's the same.

327
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,961
So it is the same as fate.

328
00:25:37,961 --> 00:25:41,961
DK is fate, or is justice, or is right.

329
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,080
Not fate.

330
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,800
What's fate in Greek?

331
00:25:46,441 --> 00:25:47,400
Oh, yeah, Moira.

332
00:25:47,641 --> 00:25:49,241
Let's not get Moira into this, right?

333
00:25:49,241 --> 00:25:51,641
And this is Aranes, which I certainly can't spell.

334
00:25:51,641 --> 00:25:53,400
Somebody spell it for me.

335
00:25:59,961 --> 00:26:01,001
Something like that.

336
00:26:01,001 --> 00:26:09,001
I mean, since it's going from Greek to English, there's no absolute, you can't call me wrong, because I can transliterate it as I please.

337
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:19,721
Anyway, the main thing is that the that wrath, justice, and furies, there is a Greek word for each of them that really does mean wrath, getting all upset and angry.

338
00:26:19,721 --> 00:27:57,640
That means that it's the way that means that means justice okay and that is another name for the furies sometimes they're called Irenees in the text here and sometimes they're called furies and now then it's not a people and they're not actually children of Zeus and well I don't know why they're capitalized in the Greek we've never came out with the answer to that one but they are and it's just a way of describing the relevant emotions or situation and that's that so don't worry about it that's all so I'm not going to worry about it and if there's something to worry about let me know so now he be where are we again so he he admits where are we 129 okay at the top of 130 he's he's going crazy he says my rebellious senses bolt with me headlong and fear against my heart is ready for the singing dance of wrath oh yeah that's what got me into it and sometimes it's capitalized in translation and sometimes it isn't but while i hold some grip on my wits that is he knows he's going crazy i say publicly to my friends i killed my mother not without some right that is i'm not legally guilty i did the right thing my father's murder stained her father's hmm where's my greek did i not bring it with me we don't have it do we uh i think i that's not going to be father everyone every time so far that he has said father and i looked it up.

339
00:27:57,641 --> 00:28:09,640
It turns out to mean, as you you've all read Shakespeare and seen this word sire or lord, it means something like sire or lord, my superior.

340
00:28:09,641 --> 00:28:12,440
And there are two words in Greek apparently.

341
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:23,001
There's one for father and one would get translated sire, and which is something like father, but not blood, not blood father.

342
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:30,840
And every time I've looked up father in the wrong context, like this, it's turned out to be the Greek word for sire.

343
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,520
So now I just have to make a note.

344
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,400
I missed that one and see if that is too.

345
00:28:35,401 --> 00:28:38,600
If not, I'll bring back the bad news next time.

346
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,800
Let's see.

347
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,880
Father, page one thirty.

348
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,560
Okay, I'm going to go out on a limb.

349
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,880
I want to say he isn't saying father.

350
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,441
He's saying sire there.

351
00:28:52,441 --> 00:28:57,080
Or if he's saying father, he's not saying it in a way that means blood relative.

352
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,520
My father's murder stained her and the gods disgust.

353
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:10,360
As for the spells that charm me to such daring, I give you in chief the seer of Pytho, Luxius, again, Apollo.

354
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,721
He declared I could do this and not be charged with wrong.

355
00:29:13,721 --> 00:29:20,280
So he's just asserting again and again, legally he didn't do anything wrong, and he isn't guilty.

356
00:29:20,681 --> 00:29:41,641
And then he says he's going to go off and now he has to somehow do some rituals, which is sort of like therapy, that will get him over this feeling of guilt, which he doesn't really deserve and he doesn't want, but he can't just say, Okay, I'm I'm not guilty, so I stop feeling guilty.

357
00:29:41,641 --> 00:29:54,761
He's got to go, he's going to go armored in leaf, branch, and garland on my way to the centerstone and sanctuary and Apollo's level place, the shining of the walls, and so forth, to escape this blood that is my own.

358
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:04,880
That is, to escape the guilt feelings of having killed his blood, his closest blood relative, his mother.

359
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,001
Okay, and then he tells you how awful they look.

360
00:30:08,001 --> 00:30:10,961
All of this I'm just giving you so the context here.

361
00:30:10,961 --> 00:30:28,001
Or the bottom of 130, he says, women who serve this house, they, that is the furies, come like gorgons, whatever they are, more, I think gorgons have snaky heads, and these furies also seem to have snaky heads, you'll see in the next thing.

362
00:30:28,001 --> 00:30:30,241
And they are reading, yeah, in a tangle of snakes.

363
00:30:30,241 --> 00:30:32,800
Okay, I can stay no longer.

364
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:40,161
And they say, and it's interesting now, by the way, notice that in this play, Aeschylus is being very modern.

365
00:30:40,641 --> 00:30:47,840
And he's not telling you that there are walking around objectively in the world these kind of creatures.

366
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:58,560
It's not like in Homer when I will call it magic realism, where if enough people believe that they saw a god, then it counts as actually seeing a god.

367
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,560
And you don't ask the question, was it really a god or was it a hallucination?

368
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,120
That's just not relevant.

369
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:11,360
If the appropriate emotion mood is on and you get attuned, Athena's there.

370
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,440
But here, he's got a sharp distinction, Aeschylus.

371
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,120
It's 500 years later.

372
00:31:17,121 --> 00:31:22,400
And the rational forces in the culture are getting stronger than they were in Homer.

373
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:37,280
So Apollo and the new gods, particularly Apollo, who represents the newest of the new gods, rationality, theory, and so forth, is making a distinction between whether those are actually out there or whether he's just seeing them.

374
00:31:37,921 --> 00:31:42,761
And they say, Orestes, dearest to your father of all men, what fancies were you?

375
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:46,120
That is, you're hallucinating.

376
00:31:46,441 --> 00:31:47,560
They don't see them.

377
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,081
The audience doesn't see them.

378
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:54,120
They're not on the stage, but they're real in the inner sense.

379
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,920
It's really psychological, in the psychological sense that he's experiencing them.

380
00:31:58,921 --> 00:32:06,200
Now, if I'm right, Aespelus is not going to leave us with that, but that's the current situation.

381
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,040
They are the bloodhounds of my mother's hate, he says.

382
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:17,560
And then he says, Oh, Lord Apollo, how they grow and multiply, repulsive for the blood drops in their dripping eyes.

383
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:23,000
And then he says to the audience in the middle of 131, You can't see them, but I see them.

384
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,600
I'm driven from this place.

385
00:32:24,601 --> 00:32:26,521
I can stay no longer.

386
00:32:26,521 --> 00:32:28,520
Okay, so it didn't work.

387
00:32:28,761 --> 00:32:38,201
One individual can't overthrow the culture, the practices, the idea that you can't just get away with murdering blood relatives.

388
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:47,960
You can do it legally, murder your blood relative or kill them if it's required, like by Apollo.

389
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,361
But you can't get away with feeling good about it.

390
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:56,680
And so finally, the chorus goes around and sees we haven't won after all.

391
00:32:56,681 --> 00:32:58,120
This is not a happy ending.

392
00:32:58,121 --> 00:32:59,561
That's one of these reversals.

393
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:08,361
It just sounded like the God had been, you know, light was there, truth was clear, everything was out in the open, everybody did what they were supposed to do.

394
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:14,201
And now it turns out, I'm going to read the starting on 1065 on page 131.

395
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:18,041
Here on this house of the kings, that's the house of Atreus.

396
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,640
And where are we?

397
00:33:19,641 --> 00:33:23,000
The third storm has broken with a wind from the inward race.

398
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,641
That's the furies in the house.

399
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,160
And gone its course.

400
00:33:28,161 --> 00:33:29,520
The children were eaten.

401
00:33:24,601 --> 00:33:30,560
That's Thaestes.

402
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,761
Thaestes' children?

403
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:33,361
I still try to get it straight.

404
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,120
Okay, Thaestes' children.

405
00:33:35,761 --> 00:33:38,880
There was the first affliction, the curse of Thaestes.

406
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,721
He cursed Atreus.

407
00:33:40,721 --> 00:33:46,241
Next came the royal death when a man and lord of Achaean armies went down.

408
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:49,841
That's Agamemnon got killed, killed in the bath.

409
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,601
Third is for the Savior.

410
00:33:51,601 --> 00:33:54,001
The Savior is Orestes.

411
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,280
That's what he should be doing.

412
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,961
He should be saving them from all this.

413
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,921
He came, shall I call it that, or death?

414
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,800
Did he really come?

415
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,241
I mean, was he a savior?

416
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:05,280
Where, presumably not, they think now.

417
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,240
Where is the end?

418
00:34:06,241 --> 00:34:10,161
Where shall the fury of fate be stilled to sleep, be done with?

419
00:34:10,161 --> 00:34:14,401
So in the end, the culture is as bad or worse off than ever.

420
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,481
That's the end of the play.

421
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,080
So then everybody goes out and has drinks and popcorn or something.

422
00:34:20,081 --> 00:34:25,681
I don't know how they managed to sit through all these three plays in a row and comes back and we get the next play.

423
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,440
And we're now, you should have, I told you last time to start reading it.

424
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,681
So we're not going on to talk about it now for a while.

425
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:35,201
But I think I ought to stop here.

426
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,560
The Eumenides is done.

427
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:40,000
Do you want to say something about it or ask something about it?

428
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,640
I'm ready to follow your lead.

429
00:34:44,641 --> 00:34:44,960
Yeah.

430
00:34:46,721 --> 00:34:47,920
No, that's not.

431
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,480
The good.

432
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,441
I really like it that you are ready to say things.

433
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:57,200
And they don't come together in a nice way, the way you at least look like you wanted them to come together.

434
00:34:57,201 --> 00:34:58,400
They collide.

435
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,241
Their world's in collision.

436
00:35:00,241 --> 00:35:04,081
The two cultures just don't get together.

437
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,320
Apollo said killer.

438
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,601
Now he's going crazy because the furies say you shouldn't have killed her.

439
00:35:10,601 --> 00:35:13,081
The two cultures are totally in opposition.

440
00:35:13,081 --> 00:35:19,001
And Orestes is being batted back and forth like a ping-pong ball between the two forces in the culture.

441
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,161
Whatever he does, it doesn't work.

442
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:26,201
It can't work because it's the cultural practices are messed up.

443
00:35:26,201 --> 00:35:34,521
If you are a revenge culture, then you're bound to have revenge after revenge after revenge and never be able to get out of it.

444
00:35:34,521 --> 00:35:45,721
And if you're a culture in which emotions, if they only have two possibilities in the culture, viewing what you're doing always with sort of family emotions, that's part of the revenge culture.

445
00:35:45,721 --> 00:36:01,160
Or this new God stuff, viewing everything everybody does with logic, rationality, and principles, and universal laws, if you believe equally in both of them, it's not coming together.

446
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:02,681
It's crashing.

447
00:36:02,681 --> 00:36:06,280
And the interesting thing, keep your eyes open for this.

448
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:16,121
Not only does perhaps not each person in the culture believes equally in both of them, though everybody believes somewhat in each of them.

449
00:36:16,121 --> 00:36:28,121
But the interesting question to ask yourself is: is it 50-50 in the culture, or what percent of the people believe that the Furies are right, and what percent of the people believe that Apollo is right?

450
00:36:28,121 --> 00:36:33,401
You would think that there wouldn't be any evidence of such precise mathematical sort, but there is.

451
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:44,121
Keep your eyes open if you can see the point where you're told by Aeschylus just which group outnumbers which group.

452
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:47,320
You should expect the right, you should guess the right answer.

453
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,201
How many how many what do you what do you think the right answer is?

454
00:36:50,201 --> 00:36:50,761
Yeah.

455
00:36:51,081 --> 00:36:53,561
Well, the exact number is crucial, yeah?

456
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:56,240
I can't hear you, but I think you're saying the right thing.

457
00:36:54,601 --> 00:37:00,560
What about the jury and then she's got it and he's on the track of it.

458
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,880
The jury splits 50-50.

459
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:14,161
The jury is the citizens, and they choose at random the twelve jurors, and they split six to six on this for the Apollo side and the Fury side.

460
00:37:14,161 --> 00:37:17,921
That just shows that the culture is split 50-50.

461
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,800
Then there's got to be a new big new problem.

462
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:28,881
And Athena casts a sort of completely wacky seeming vote for very weird reasons and settles that.

463
00:37:29,201 --> 00:37:33,280
The important thing is you get a clue that this is a really split culture.

464
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,481
You want to say something?

465
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,761
Oh, I thought I was going to end.

466
00:37:35,761 --> 00:37:36,240
Okay.

467
00:37:36,241 --> 00:37:38,161
Well, now you've said interesting things.

468
00:37:38,161 --> 00:37:41,041
We can go on to the next round.

469
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:44,000
So where are we?

470
00:37:45,121 --> 00:37:50,401
So three questions are left at the end of the humanities.

471
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,721
How can Orestes be cured?

472
00:37:52,721 --> 00:37:53,920
And we're going to find out.

473
00:37:54,241 --> 00:37:55,920
You know, cured of his guilt feelings.

474
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,601
That's like a sickness.

475
00:37:57,601 --> 00:38:02,481
How can the splits in the culture that cause this sickness be cured?

476
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,721
And that has two sub-questions.

477
00:38:04,721 --> 00:38:06,961
What are you going to do with the Furies?

478
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:14,161
How can you somehow turn them from being a negative and destructive social force into some kind of positive social force?

479
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:16,401
How could you possibly do that?

480
00:38:16,721 --> 00:38:32,961
And how can you redefine reason and Apollo so that the emotions, namely the Furies, don't run into a head-on conflict with reason, namely Apollo, but somehow they support each other.

481
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,561
That's what you want.

482
00:38:34,561 --> 00:38:35,681
But can you get that?

483
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:37,361
And how would you get that?

484
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:47,320
And if you can, then Athens has developed a really wonderful culture in which they've integrated emotion and reason in a positive way.

485
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,241
And we have to see if and how that can be done.

486
00:38:51,561 --> 00:38:55,480
So, next, now I have to prepare you for the reading of the humanities.

487
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:01,721
I really should have prepared you last time, but it's really all right to let you see what you see on your own.

488
00:39:02,521 --> 00:39:13,881
You probably realized if you started when you started reading it, the Furies are now on stage, really there, jumping up and down, lying around, looking awful, and so forth.

489
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:22,681
And the interesting thing is that that doesn't mean that Aeschylus has changed his mind and sort of gone back to Homeric realism.

490
00:39:22,681 --> 00:39:24,681
It means that we're on a different level now.

491
00:39:24,681 --> 00:39:27,881
The cultural forces are just personified.

492
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:39,001
I mean, the Furies represent the fact that in the culture, everybody has to avenge everybody and is always in a state of emotional excitement.

493
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:49,400
And Apollo is on stage now, and he represents the extreme force toward rationality which is taking gaining ever since Homer.

494
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:55,241
I mean, Homer already was trying to read the Furies out and make the culture more rational.

495
00:39:55,241 --> 00:40:01,721
And it's now gotten 500 years further along, and Apollo is a lot more rational than he ever was in Homer.

496
00:40:01,721 --> 00:40:10,361
And they're all on the stage, and what they say represents these various cultural forces.

497
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:10,920
Okay.

498
00:40:11,241 --> 00:40:18,680
And the way you can tell that they're switched around is that everyone now sees the Furies.

499
00:40:19,241 --> 00:40:22,040
It's not just Orestes anymore.

500
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,201
And the audience sees the Furies, which they didn't before.

501
00:40:25,521 --> 00:40:38,241
So now the Furies, not that that means that there really are Furies running around and Apollo running around, but it means that this is an objective truth about the cultural practices that everybody sees.

502
00:40:38,241 --> 00:40:45,041
And in a metaphorical sense, sees them, and in a literal sense in the play, they see them.

503
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,080
Okay.

504
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:51,040
Now, that's easy to say.

505
00:40:51,041 --> 00:41:04,080
What's hard to understand, and I wouldn't expect you to understand it on your own, and I'm not sure I got it right, but the Furies say some pretty peculiar things, and for years I've tried to make sense of them.

506
00:41:04,081 --> 00:41:06,161
I never know whether I've succeeded.

507
00:41:06,161 --> 00:41:14,241
But what's wrong with the fact, what goes on that's puzzling, is the Furies have redefined their domain.

508
00:41:14,241 --> 00:41:25,041
They're no longer just the forces of wrath and revenge and emotional outrage.

509
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:29,201
And you see this in a puzzling way at the bottom of 144.

510
00:41:29,201 --> 00:41:30,000
And who's talking?

511
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,041
The Furies.

512
00:41:31,041 --> 00:41:47,041
You must give back for her blood from the living man, red blood of your body suck, and from your own, I would feed with bitter swallow drench, turn your strange, turn your strange limp, what your strength limp, while yet you live and drag you down.

513
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:55,841
This must be really sort of, remember this, and you have to realize this is sort of sung and encanted by these dancing, awful creatures.

514
00:41:57,601 --> 00:42:12,121
Where you must pay for the pain of the murdered mother and watch the rest of the mortals stained with violence against God or guest or hurt parents who were close and dear, each with the pain upon him that his crime deserves.

515
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,121
What's strange about that?

516
00:42:14,121 --> 00:42:16,441
Jolt, you in what I was just reading?

517
00:42:16,761 --> 00:42:24,280
You've got to be very sensitive to being jolted because you learn something or you run to the translation and then, if you can't fix it, you learn something.

518
00:42:24,601 --> 00:42:26,120
Don't you see anything strange?

519
00:42:26,761 --> 00:42:32,201
They're going to be in charge of hurt parents and guests.

520
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,720
Guests?

521
00:42:33,721 --> 00:42:36,040
What is that doing on the list of the Fury business?

522
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:37,880
They're the blood relative business.

523
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,561
They're not in the Fury business.

524
00:42:39,561 --> 00:42:43,320
That's very upsetting if you're reading it closely.

525
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,161
And it's not, I mean, I went to the translation.

526
00:42:47,161 --> 00:42:49,081
No, that's what it really says.

527
00:42:49,081 --> 00:42:51,960
And moreover, that's not the only place they say it.

528
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:58,921
They say it again on page 154 at the top.

529
00:42:59,241 --> 00:43:05,641
Let man see this and take care to mother and father and to the guest in the gates.

530
00:43:05,641 --> 00:43:09,161
Welcomed, given all rights that befall their position.

531
00:43:09,161 --> 00:43:19,400
They're really doing a kind of a new god, Athena, Hermes, and Zeus, insofar as he's a new god thing there.

532
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,920
That's not their job.

533
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,601
It's not their business.

534
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:28,840
Well, I wish I could just tell you clearly what's happening, but I can't.

535
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:33,401
But if you read the play, I think you'll see that what's happening.

536
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,040
As I say, this is only my speculation.

537
00:43:36,041 --> 00:43:38,761
If you think it's wrong, it's a good paper topic to say so.

538
00:43:39,081 --> 00:43:51,001
The furies are being generalized into something that's recognizably like what they were, but it covers a lot more than just family feuds.

539
00:43:51,000 --> 00:44:04,081
And how I would define it is something like the furies, and it's got to be emotional, and it's got to cover more than family feuds, but it can't be sort of rational like Apollo.

540
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:12,401
I take it to be, I think, any moral outrage at something which strikes you as wrong.

541
00:44:12,721 --> 00:44:18,641
That is moral outrage, not just moral condemnation or disapproval.

542
00:44:18,641 --> 00:44:28,800
But they are what they are that in the culture and in each person raised in that culture that makes them just furious when somebody does something wrong.

543
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,040
And they just generalize the job.

544
00:44:31,041 --> 00:44:52,800
And even if that means running off with your guest's wife or throwing a stool at an old beggar, the kind of bad things that people did to guests in the Odyssey and got in big trouble for it, they still get in big trouble for it, but they don't get in big trouble for it because Zeus is a friend of guests or because guests go from world to world.

545
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:58,320
They get in big trouble for it just because it's in the culture that they get upset when guests get badly treated.

546
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,761
That's the only way I can see it.

547
00:44:59,761 --> 00:45:02,881
If you I see a hand, I would love to you want to say something.

548
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,840
Oh, I don't know why the people down and why we don't get that enough for them.

549
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,201
Okay, well, good, good.

550
00:45:13,201 --> 00:45:19,360
I see what you're saying, and I think you're making a kind of objection to what I said, which is interesting.

551
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,680
And I may have to, I don't know, I'll try to squirm out of it.

552
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,120
Let me repeat it.

553
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:38,320
So on 156, there is this interesting discussion where Orestes says, why weren't you upset when Clytemnestra killed Agamemnon?

554
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,481
You should have been.

555
00:45:42,121 --> 00:45:44,840
Instead, let's see now.

556
00:45:45,161 --> 00:45:47,561
Let's just read it on 156.

557
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,921
She murdered her husband and my father, too, and there he means father.

558
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:59,001
And the chorus says, of this thing, death has set her free, that you're still alive.

559
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,081
But when she lived, why did you not descend and drive her out?

560
00:46:03,081 --> 00:46:13,401
That is, why didn't the Furies punish Clytemnestra for killing Agamemnon?

561
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:23,001
See, Clytemnestra says it's her Furies and Phaginias that are causing them to kill Agamemnon.

562
00:46:24,121 --> 00:46:39,481
But it should be, Agamemnon's, the Furies should be trying to get, it's complicated, the Furies should be trying to get Orestes, who is the son of Agamemnon, to kill Clytemnestra, right?

563
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:47,161
But we don't hear anywhere in the book that the Furies are the ones who wanted to kill Clytemnestra.

564
00:46:47,161 --> 00:46:50,841
It's that it's Apollo who wants him to kill Clytemnestra.

565
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:54,280
And the Furies say, well, we don't have to worry about her.

566
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,160
The man she killed was not a blood congenital.

567
00:46:57,161 --> 00:46:59,001
That's very interesting.

568
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:08,121
That means that the Furies don't care about marriage, which is just a question of an institution and an oath.

569
00:47:08,121 --> 00:47:13,081
They only care when blood relatives are hurt.

570
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:18,041
Now, that's true about the Furies.

571
00:47:18,041 --> 00:47:24,681
And then the whole conversation is, but am I then involved with my mother by blood bond?

572
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,161
Because they are upset that he killed his mother.

573
00:47:30,161 --> 00:47:31,761
And they say, Yeah, she is.

574
00:47:31,761 --> 00:47:34,800
How else could she have nursed you, and so forth and so forth?

575
00:47:35,041 --> 00:47:40,081
Your mother is your blood relative, and you killed a blood relative, and so you're in trouble.

576
00:47:40,081 --> 00:47:45,681
And Agamemnon killed a blood relative named Ephijania, so he's in trouble.

577
00:47:45,681 --> 00:47:48,080
But Clytemnestra didn't kill any blood relative.

578
00:47:48,081 --> 00:47:51,121
She just killed her husband, so she's not in trouble.

579
00:47:51,761 --> 00:47:53,920
That's the argument of the Furies.

580
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:59,840
Now, but her objection to me is that you've got a good objection.

581
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,520
I mean, everything so far we have to agree on.

582
00:48:03,761 --> 00:48:04,800
That's how it is.

583
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,641
That's what the Furies are saying.

584
00:48:06,641 --> 00:48:09,121
They only punish blood relatives.

585
00:48:09,121 --> 00:48:12,161
But then, how did they get generalized into guests?

586
00:48:12,161 --> 00:48:14,561
You're a very smart question.

587
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:15,761
I don't know.

588
00:48:15,761 --> 00:48:22,161
That's why I said with such hesitation that I can only understand them as moral outrage.

589
00:48:22,161 --> 00:48:25,440
But why don't they have moral outrage when a wife kills a husband?

590
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,040
Well, I don't know.

591
00:48:27,041 --> 00:48:31,201
I mean, there's sometimes, I wish I could be clearer and better about this.

592
00:48:31,201 --> 00:48:40,800
It's as if the Furies sometimes are like the old Furies, and sometimes they've got a bigger, newer job.

593
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,920
And unless somebody comes along and helps me out, maybe Beatrice, I'm stuck.

594
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,320
Aha!

595
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:49,841
I like it.

596
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,440
Well, no, it won't work.

597
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:51,920
I'm sorry.

598
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,361
I liked it for one minute.

599
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:58,160
But no, it won't work because it isn't a question of family, but of blood.

600
00:48:58,161 --> 00:49:08,561
See, fathers are certainly part of the family, but from the Furies' point of view, you don't have to kill a father because, I mean, sorry, husbands are part of the family.

601
00:49:08,561 --> 00:49:11,400
And if you just kill your husband, the Furies are not upset.

602
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,840
That's what just came out with this thing.

603
00:49:09,601 --> 00:49:15,320
Clydemnestra, after all, she killed Agamemnon.

604
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:15,641
Who cares?

605
00:49:15,641 --> 00:49:17,001
They're not blood relatives.

606
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:24,041
So and if their husband isn't part of your family, then I don't think the guests are going to become part of your family just by coming to dinner.

607
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:25,720
That's not going to help.

608
00:49:26,121 --> 00:49:27,560
So I'm still stumped.

609
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,641
Anybody else want to help?

610
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:35,880
Okay, I'll have to say something absolutely weasly until somebody comes up better.

611
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,721
That culture is confused.

612
00:49:37,721 --> 00:50:05,721
I'm confused, and Aeschylus is confused, but I think it's mainly he's sort of saying here's a culture in transition between, I guess, really narrow Furies who only worry about killing blood relatives, which is their sort of original, primitive, barbaric status, and a more general kind of fury, which is moral outrage, as I say.

613
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,400
This is like the 60s.

614
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,481
There used to be lots of dogs in the lectures in the 60s.

615
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,800
I once told, I don't think it'll work anymore.

616
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:18,520
I once told a dog, my brother's also a professor here who loves dogs, so he was in the wrong lecture.

617
00:50:18,681 --> 00:50:19,960
He should go to my brother's lecture.

618
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,481
Go to my brother's lecture.

619
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:24,761
I don't think it's going to help because my brother retired.

620
00:50:25,081 --> 00:50:29,001
Anyway, back to, this is a way to avoid facing the problem.

621
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:41,081
The problem is it looks like the Furies are in transition from a very narrow construal of what they're up to to a broader construal of what they're up to.

622
00:50:41,081 --> 00:50:44,361
And this mention of guests is a sign of it.

623
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,761
And so, anyway, that's the best I can do.

624
00:50:46,761 --> 00:50:49,160
Come and see me in office hours if you've got a solution.

625
00:50:49,161 --> 00:50:55,121
Anybody who can really explain this gets an A-plus on their paper, no matter what else they say.

626
00:50:54,521 --> 00:50:58,241
Okay, now let's see.

627
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,441
Where are we?

628
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,361
Okay, we've got they get very general.

629
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,320
The culture's getting, ah, he's off to my brother's lecture.

630
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:08,560
Good.

631
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,240
The Furies say that they've been excluded and so forth.

632
00:51:14,241 --> 00:51:16,561
Okay, yes, a very important line.

633
00:51:16,561 --> 00:51:17,440
Very important.

634
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,920
It's going to turn, it's sort of snuck by here on purpose by Aeschylus.

635
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:27,280
He's going to need it later, but we can see it now on page 147.

636
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:37,200
Part of the thing that we have to explain is why the Furies are so upset about everything, but particularly about the new gods.

637
00:51:37,201 --> 00:51:40,401
They've got this total outrage about the new gods.

638
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,561
What did the new gods do to the Furies that they're so upset about?

639
00:51:44,561 --> 00:51:47,681
Well, it comes out in the middle of 147.

640
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:54,800
I have chosen overthrow of houses where the battle god growing within strikes near and dear down.

641
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,320
That's the Fury saying.

642
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,521
Isn't that interesting?

643
00:51:57,521 --> 00:51:59,761
That's part of the same thing we're talking about.

644
00:51:59,761 --> 00:52:03,441
The near and dear seem to be different than the guests.

645
00:52:03,761 --> 00:52:08,081
If you can think of guests as near and dear, maybe you're getting somewhere.

646
00:52:08,081 --> 00:52:10,480
Anyway, I don't want to go back into that.

647
00:52:10,721 --> 00:52:12,401
I really want the next quote.

648
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,721
Here we stand in our haste to wrench from all others these devisings.

649
00:52:16,721 --> 00:52:21,921
Make the gods clear of our counsels so that even appeal comes not to them.

650
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,520
Now comes the crucial line.

651
00:52:23,521 --> 00:52:30,081
Since Zeus has ruled our blood-dripping company outcast, nor will deal with us.

652
00:52:30,081 --> 00:52:43,720
What they're really angry about is that Zeus, qua representing now the new gods, won't even deal with, won't talk to, won't make treaties with the Furies.

653
00:52:39,601 --> 00:52:46,360
It's like the United States and North Korea.

654
00:52:46,521 --> 00:52:52,921
I mean, Zeus just considers the Furies the empire of evil, and they can't stand it.

655
00:52:53,561 --> 00:53:02,681
It's that rejection by the powers that have the power that is making them furious.

656
00:53:02,681 --> 00:53:14,841
And it's going to turn out to be very important, that that's really deeply their problem, that they're not accepted, they're not integrated, they're not appreciated by the new gods and the new practices.

657
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:18,520
Now, why that's going to be important, I can't tell you yet, but remember it.

658
00:53:18,521 --> 00:53:21,481
We'll come back to that little quote later.

659
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,600
But what's happening is clear.

660
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:29,161
The cultural horses are getting more and more rational all the time.

661
00:53:29,161 --> 00:53:37,481
And that's, and more and more, they're being disapproved, ignored, denied, repressed.

662
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:41,561
My one word for it is: the culture is repressing the emotions.

663
00:53:41,561 --> 00:53:44,201
It's repressing the feelings of moral outrage.

664
00:53:44,201 --> 00:53:46,041
It's repressing all feelings.

665
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:49,880
It's getting to be the logic freak.

666
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:55,241
It's tending in the direction of the craziness of rationality in Apollo.

667
00:53:55,241 --> 00:54:00,600
And if any, I don't forget how many, I don't know maybe I ever, how many read any Socrates or Plato in there?

668
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:09,320
Well, that's where it's heading, where everything is really logical and debatable and emotions.

669
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,761
How many read the Euthyphro?

670
00:54:10,761 --> 00:54:12,840
That would be the first thing to read for this.

671
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:19,161
Well, the Euthyphro is where Plato says that piety, which means love of the tradition, is a bad thing.

672
00:54:19,161 --> 00:54:25,921
I mean, that's where they're heading, and the Furies see it's coming, and they get they're very, very upset.

673
00:54:24,681 --> 00:54:29,041
So now we're there, let's see.

674
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:33,681
So, oh, yeah, now we get a fun thing, and there's plenty of time.

675
00:54:33,681 --> 00:54:36,320
And now, let's see it from the other side.

676
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,641
Why are the Furies so upset?

677
00:54:38,641 --> 00:54:49,361
Well, you can see it by looking at what Apollo's priestess says when she sees the Furies, and what Apollo says when he sees the Furies.

678
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:53,920
I mean, to say that they're not appreciated is an understatement.

679
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,201
And where does this happen?

680
00:54:57,521 --> 00:55:07,601
Okay, on 136, at the beginning of the play, you see exactly how far it's gone in the non-appreciation of the Furies.

681
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:24,560
The priestess of Apollo comes staggering out of the temple and says, things terrible to tell and for the eyes to see, terrible drove me out again from Luxius' house so that I have no strength and cannot stand on springing feet that run with hands help and my legs have no speed.

682
00:55:24,561 --> 00:55:25,761
She's crawling out.

683
00:55:25,761 --> 00:55:28,481
It's complicated, Aeschylus way of saying.

684
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:34,560
And why is she crawling out of as fast as she can from the temple?

685
00:55:34,561 --> 00:55:36,960
She's just been knocked over by what she saw.

686
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:42,001
And here's what she saw at the bottom third of 136.

687
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,841
In front of this man slept a startling company of women lying all upon the chairs.

688
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,720
And this is the first real description we've got of the Furies.

689
00:55:50,721 --> 00:55:52,560
Or not women, I think.

690
00:55:52,561 --> 00:55:57,121
I call them rather gorgons, only not gorgons either, since their shape is not the same.

691
00:55:57,121 --> 00:55:58,880
I saw some creatures painted in a picture.

692
00:55:58,880 --> 00:55:59,841
Let's skip that.

693
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:04,320
They are black and utterly repulsive, and they snore with breaths that drives one back.

694
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:12,520
From their eyes drips the foul ooze in their dress is such as not right to wear in the presence of the gods, statues, or even any human house.

695
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:23,641
I've never seen the tribe that owns this company, nor know what piece of earth can claim with pride it bore such brood without hurt, and so forth and so forth.

696
00:56:23,641 --> 00:56:29,961
Well, from the priestess point of view, she doesn't even know what they are.

697
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:41,320
That she just can't recognize them as anything that she's ever heard of or seen, and she finds them just incomprehensibly repulsive.

698
00:56:42,521 --> 00:56:49,000
But now, on the other hand, Apollo recognizes them and thinks they're just terrible.

699
00:56:49,000 --> 00:57:01,241
I mean, you could have it either way, that they are just so repulsive and so alien to the current rational tendency in the culture that Apollo's priestess doesn't even know what they are, just that they're some ugly, awful thing.

700
00:57:01,241 --> 00:57:08,601
Or on 137, Apollo knows perfectly well who they are, and he has a lot of very nasty things to say about them.

701
00:57:08,601 --> 00:57:13,241
On 137, about a quarter of the way down, I will not give you up.

702
00:57:13,641 --> 00:57:21,400
He's talking to Orestes, though to the end standing your guardian, through to the end, standing your guardian, whether by your side or far away.

703
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,481
I shall not weaken towards your enemies.

704
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:27,961
So now I have caught and overpowered these lewd creatures.

705
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,640
That's his view of the furies.

706
00:57:29,641 --> 00:57:33,641
These repulsive maidens have been still to sleep.

707
00:57:33,641 --> 00:57:41,641
Those gray and aged children, they with whom no mortal man, no god, nor even any beast will have to do.

708
00:57:41,641 --> 00:57:56,161
Well, I want to stop to say for one thing: furies fall asleep and they get overpowered, and that's because, remember, I said emotions, after a certain amount of time, just sort of wear down.

709
00:57:56,161 --> 00:58:02,161
You can't keep yourself into a constant state of guilt feelings or outrage or anything else.

710
00:58:02,161 --> 00:58:05,521
You've just got to go relax and go to sleep every once in a while.

711
00:58:05,521 --> 00:58:07,280
And that's what happens to the Furies.

712
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:13,280
They just sort of not standing guard, they're falling asleep, and that's going to be important too.

713
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,561
That's how they're losing their grip on Orestes.

714
00:58:16,561 --> 00:58:18,960
And why are they aged children?

715
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,641
Do you understand that?

716
00:58:21,681 --> 00:58:24,561
The funny thing to say.

717
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,241
Well, why are they aged?

718
00:58:26,241 --> 00:58:27,841
Why are they old?

719
00:58:29,121 --> 00:58:36,081
Because they go way back to the beginning of the race, to the beginning of all culture.

720
00:58:36,081 --> 00:58:48,800
Remember, I said they come from the blood of the fact that in the first generation of gods, Uranus, I think it is, castrates Kronos, and from the blood comes the Fury.

721
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,081
So they're very old.

722
00:58:50,081 --> 00:58:51,520
And why would they be children?

723
00:58:51,521 --> 00:58:53,201
Have you got an idea about that?

724
00:58:53,201 --> 00:58:57,681
Well, they're very primitive and irrational and emotional, like children are.

725
00:58:57,681 --> 00:59:01,441
They're not going to be making logical arguments like Apollo.

726
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:07,041
So Apollo thinks they call them aged children, primitives, you could say, in one word.

727
00:59:07,041 --> 00:59:15,761
And now comes another interesting thing, with whom no mortal man, and that would mean woman too, presumably, would have anything to do, Apollo says.

728
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:17,361
Is that true?

729
00:59:17,681 --> 00:59:20,080
Can you think of a counterexample to Apollo here?

730
00:59:20,241 --> 00:59:21,840
He would be sensitive to counter example.

731
00:59:22,161 --> 00:59:26,641
Can you think of anybody who does have to do with the furies?

732
00:59:27,601 --> 00:59:28,960
Well, Clytemnestra.

733
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,160
She calls on them.

734
00:59:30,161 --> 00:59:31,601
Ophiginia is Furies.

735
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:33,361
She's all for them.

736
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:42,921
So it isn't as if, and half the population, we discover later at the trial, is whoever it is, said, will have plenty to do with the Furies.

737
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:45,721
And the same problem with the gods, only you don't know it yet.

738
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:50,601
And he says no mortal man, no God would have anything to do with them.

739
00:59:50,601 --> 00:59:59,481
Well, it's going to turn out, I don't know how many read far enough, how many know what God is going to have something to do with the furies?

740
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:00,440
Only a few.

741
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:03,400
Okay, well, Athena does, so that's wrong too.

742
01:00:04,761 --> 01:00:08,040
And then you get this funny story about why they're there.

743
01:00:08,041 --> 01:00:17,400
It was because of evil they were born, because they hold the evil darkness of the pit below, earth, below earth, loathed alike by men and by the heavenly gods.

744
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:21,400
Well, not all men, not all human beings, and not all gods.

745
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:26,841
But now there's a kind of funny, not funny, but crazy kind of pun in this.

746
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:29,481
They were born because of evil.

747
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:32,121
That is, they were born to punish evil.

748
01:00:32,121 --> 01:00:34,201
But Apollo puts a different spin on it.

749
01:00:34,201 --> 01:00:43,001
He thinks that they're born to perpetuate evil because he can't see that they've got any positive function.

750
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:49,161
So that's, so I'm just reading that so you can understand why they would be upset.

751
01:00:49,480 --> 01:01:09,720
They're lewd, they're dark, they're evil, they're indecent, they're primitive, and they are, sort of, because they are irrational, extreme outrage, and sort of a very sharp distinction between good and bad, and very much against what they think is bad.

752
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:17,161
And Apollo can't stand this darkness, and he doesn't see any value in being underground in the earth.

753
01:01:17,161 --> 01:01:23,561
And so, and so and he thinks they're born of evil in this bad way, and so forth.

754
01:01:23,561 --> 01:01:25,601
And that's it.

755
01:01:25,601 --> 01:01:30,721
And Apollo takes credit for the way Orestes killed Clytemnestra.

756
01:01:30,721 --> 01:01:44,400
In case you had any doubt whether he did it in a cold, rational, detached way or not, you look at the bottom of 137 and you see Apollo say, for it was I who made you strike your mother down.

757
01:01:44,721 --> 01:01:58,641
And that's just sort of baiting the Furies into more outrage because Apollo is protecting him in the temple for having done what the Furies think is the worst thing you can do, kill a blood relative.

758
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,441
Okay, any comments about that?

759
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:05,841
There's I still could go one more unit of understanding.

760
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:06,960
Okay, let's do it.

761
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,881
One more unit of understanding.

762
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:14,161
So they're asleep, and we hear more about why they're asleep at the middle of 139.

763
01:02:14,161 --> 01:02:16,080
But I've already said it, but I'll show you.

764
01:02:16,081 --> 01:02:34,401
So Clytemnestra, who's trying to get the Furies back to work, meaning trying to make sure that Orestes is still feeling completely horrible guilt, says to them, sleep and fatigue, two masterful conspirators, have dimmed the deadly anger of the mother snake.

765
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,921
She understands.

766
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,920
And she wakes them up, and they get up and they start, get him, get him, get him.

767
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,641
They're back after Orestes again.

768
01:02:42,641 --> 01:02:51,681
And she says a little three lines down in her next speech, Let not work's weariness beat you, nor slacken with speed, so that you forget my pain.

769
01:02:51,681 --> 01:03:01,361
So, and forgetting her pain, they're supposed to not let Orestes forget his pain at killing his mother.

770
01:03:02,081 --> 01:03:06,800
And he isn't guilty, but he feels guilty.

771
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,880
But he doesn't feel guilty anymore, you'll see.

772
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,361
He's getting over it.

773
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,361
But first, there's a debate between the Furies and Apollo.

774
01:03:09,601 --> 01:03:15,160
So we have to do that.

775
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:17,480
We'll see what's happening in that debate.

776
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:22,761
They're going on the usual thing, but you get it from lots of different angles.

777
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
And every time you do, it's a little clearer.

778
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:28,201
Here's, I mean, they're telling again why they're so upset.

779
01:03:28,201 --> 01:03:30,761
Remember, one of them is that they're repressed.

780
01:03:30,761 --> 01:03:33,641
They're not appreciated anymore.

781
01:03:33,641 --> 01:03:42,680
And so halfway down, roughly line 149 on page 140: shame, son of Zeus, robbers is all you are.

782
01:03:42,681 --> 01:03:54,921
The young gods, you have ridden down powers gray with age, taken the suppliant, though a godless man, who hurt the mother who gave him birth, yourself a god, you stole an apricot away.

783
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:57,800
Where in this act shall any man say there is right?

784
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:02,201
So she's doing her things and their things.

785
01:04:02,201 --> 01:04:09,241
And they're making, I'm going to read you two sort of extreme statements from the point of view of Apollo and the Furies.

786
01:04:09,241 --> 01:04:13,720
And you're supposed to think that they'll never be able to get reconciled.

787
01:04:13,721 --> 01:04:17,481
So here on 163 is one of them.

788
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,320
Here's the Furies talking.

789
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,400
Such are the actions of the younger gods.

790
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:30,200
These hold by unconditioned force beyond all right a throne that runs reeking with blood, meaning that there's all this blood among the gods.

791
01:04:30,201 --> 01:04:35,241
After all, they're constantly killing each other up to the new gods.

792
01:04:35,241 --> 01:04:42,441
The new gods have finally, I think, put an end to this craziness where the gods are killing each other.

793
01:04:42,241 --> 01:04:45,481
Uh but the throne is reeking with blood from the past.

794
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:50,521
It runs re blood at the feet, blood at the head, and so forth and so forth.

795
01:04:50,521 --> 01:04:57,280
And mainly they have at the bottom of one hundred forty blighted age-old disab distributions of power.

796
01:04:57,601 --> 01:05:09,681
That means, again, that they used to have equal power, or well, first more power in the primitive times, and then presumably equal power at the time that this is happening.

797
01:05:09,681 --> 01:05:14,800
But they're things are getting worse and worse, and the distribution of power is switching over.

798
01:05:15,041 --> 01:05:18,401
So now that's their side.

799
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,041
Now we hear Apollo's side.

800
01:05:21,681 --> 01:05:26,161
And that's with one hundred forty-one, line one eighty-five.

801
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:30,241
This house is no right place for such as you to cling upon.

802
01:05:30,241 --> 01:05:33,521
The the the Apollo says, get out of my temple, in effect.

803
01:05:33,521 --> 01:05:36,400
But where, and now this is why you guys are so bad.

804
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:44,881
By judgments given, heads are lopped and eyes gouged out, throats cut, and by the spoil of sex, the glory of young boys is defeated.

805
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,001
That's castration or circumcision or something.

806
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:55,200
Where mutilation lives in stoning and the long moan of tortured men spiked beneath the spine and stuck on pails.

807
01:05:55,201 --> 01:06:10,001
I mean, this is really primitive warfare and retribution and weird rituals, which we now find disgusting, and Apollo already finds disgusting.

808
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,800
So he thinks this is just barbaric stuff.

809
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,121
And that's what I just read.

810
01:06:17,761 --> 01:06:21,041
Anything, for him, anything primitive is bad.

811
01:06:21,041 --> 01:06:22,720
Reason is always right.

812
01:06:22,721 --> 01:06:24,320
It's all that matters.

813
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:34,320
Everything that's irrational, all emotions, because they're irrational, are bad and should be banned and should be banished, put underground, repressed.

814
01:06:34,641 --> 01:06:41,960
And the idea that that they could have a positive role strikes him as completely wrong.

815
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,681
By the way, we should look at page 142.

816
01:06:44,681 --> 01:06:49,000
Here's one of those places where I did catch the translator getting it wrong.

817
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:55,160
The top of 142, Apollo says, the word to exact price for his father.

818
01:06:55,481 --> 01:06:56,200
What of that?

819
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:57,480
What's going on here?

820
01:06:58,441 --> 01:07:04,040
Chorus, the Furies say, you gave this out slander the word to kill his mother.

821
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:08,040
Apollo says, to exact price for his father.

822
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,320
What of that?

823
01:07:09,721 --> 01:07:12,601
Now, that sounds sensible to us.

824
01:07:12,601 --> 01:07:20,840
But remember that he's being, that she had every, it was okay for her to kill Agamemnon.

825
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:21,800
Remember?

826
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:22,601
Why?

827
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,641
He's just her husband.

828
01:07:25,641 --> 01:07:27,561
Husbands don't count for the Furies.

829
01:07:27,561 --> 01:07:29,400
Only blood relatives count.

830
01:07:29,721 --> 01:07:37,880
So he doesn't understand why didn't you exact price for the father?

831
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:41,800
Only he wouldn't say father because that's a blood relative thing.

832
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:47,481
He says sire or Lord, that is, but he means, they both mean Agamemnon.

833
01:07:47,481 --> 01:07:49,320
It's just how they describe him.

834
01:07:49,321 --> 01:08:00,761
And he says, why didn't you, wait, no, yeah, why didn't you punish him for killing the king, in effect?

835
01:08:00,761 --> 01:08:05,480
And they say that's because he wasn't a blood relative.

836
01:08:06,361 --> 01:08:08,761
And let's see.

837
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:11,641
And they say in the middle of the page, and yet we have our duty.

838
01:08:11,641 --> 01:08:15,160
It has to do, it was to do what we have done.

839
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:17,641
And he says he's very surprised, Apollo.

840
01:08:17,641 --> 01:08:20,280
An office, that means a job.

841
01:08:20,281 --> 01:08:26,080
You, you, you know, foul monsters, found forth your glorious privilege.

842
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:30,800
And then they say to drive macricides out of their house.

843
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,880
And that's fine.

844
01:08:33,521 --> 01:08:34,400
That's their job.

845
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:39,601
And then he says, very logically, we're back to that again, but what if it be the woman that kills her man?

846
01:08:39,601 --> 01:08:43,040
And they say such murder would not be the shedding of kindred blood.

847
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,400
Marriage doesn't count.

848
01:08:44,401 --> 01:08:48,880
I just wanted to read that because, in case you thought I made it up, it's there.

849
01:08:49,761 --> 01:08:55,601
And Apollo then says, and this is interesting, and this is a nice way to see the difference.

850
01:08:55,601 --> 01:09:04,960
I mean, when a man and woman get together, the Furies think that that's just irrelevant.

851
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:10,800
And Apollo thinks that's marriage, that that's a very beautiful institution.

852
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:11,681
So read that.

853
01:09:11,681 --> 01:09:17,681
You have made into a thing of no account, no place, the sworn faith of Zeus and Hera.

854
01:09:17,681 --> 01:09:19,441
Notice sworn faith.

855
01:09:19,441 --> 01:09:21,120
It's not blood relatives.

856
01:09:21,521 --> 01:09:24,800
They said, I do, and they married each other.

857
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:32,560
Hera, lady of consummations, and Cyprus, that's Aphrodite.

858
01:09:32,561 --> 01:09:34,960
By such argument is thrown away.

859
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:40,561
Now, it looks like Aphrodite is not exactly the one you want to invoke for marriages.

860
01:09:40,561 --> 01:09:44,560
She just broke up the marriage of Agamemnon and Helen.

861
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:49,120
But things have changed, and Aphrodite has changed.

862
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:55,040
She's no longer the goddess of wild, erotic passion, married or not.

863
01:09:55,040 --> 01:10:04,561
She's the goddess of domestic long lifetime love of a husband and wife.

864
01:10:04,561 --> 01:10:05,601
You can see this.

865
01:10:06,481 --> 01:10:11,641
So the an Cyprus of such argument is thrown away, outlawed.

866
01:10:11,641 --> 01:10:13,880
And now this is Apollo, new god talk.

867
01:10:09,681 --> 01:10:16,601
Yet the sweetest things in man's life come from her.

868
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:19,480
That is, love and marriage.

869
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:25,721
For married love between man and woman is bigger than oaths, guarded by right.

870
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:28,040
And then it says of nature.

871
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:31,320
And I thought, of nature, what's natural about marriage?

872
01:10:31,321 --> 01:10:32,120
Nothing.

873
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:33,880
So I went back to the translation.

874
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,240
There is no of nature.

875
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:36,520
Cross it out.

876
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:47,400
It's a question of oaths, of swearing to be stick to each other in sickness and health and all that.

877
01:10:47,401 --> 01:10:57,080
If when such kill each other, you relent so as not to take vengeance nor island in wrath, then I deny your manhood, Orestes goes with right.

878
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:02,840
I see that one cause moves you to strong rage, but on the other, you clearly unmoved out.

879
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:06,440
See, what's bothering him there is that they're not impartial.

880
01:11:06,441 --> 01:11:08,840
They're not rational.

881
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,120
They're not saying.

882
01:11:10,441 --> 01:11:14,440
They're saying, well, if he kills his mother, that's terrible.

883
01:11:14,441 --> 01:11:17,960
But if she kills her husband, we don't care.

884
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:20,840
And he finds that unacceptable.

885
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:23,880
So do we, because we're rational too.

886
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:34,601
And Apollo thinks that all killers should be punished equally and totally.

887
01:11:35,561 --> 01:11:36,360
Where are we?

888
01:11:37,641 --> 01:11:38,920
Yeah, it's okay.

889
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:44,520
Just about where I want to be, which is good, because we just have about three minutes.

890
01:11:44,681 --> 01:11:46,681
So we got Aphrodite, we got marriage.

891
01:11:46,681 --> 01:11:50,920
We can't we can't, Apollo can't stand the fury's partiality.

892
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:54,880
Remember, I want to just read it again on 157.

893
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:59,040
You don't hear it but once, but I keep coming back to it.

894
01:11:54,521 --> 01:12:01,440
Apollo is totally impartial.

895
01:12:01,761 --> 01:12:07,920
He says, You must have marked it already because I read it already: I shall speak justly, I shall not lie.

896
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:15,920
Never for man, woman, or city, for my throne of prophecy have I spoken a word except that which Father Zeus of the Olympians might command.

897
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,200
This is justice.

898
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:20,240
He's just saying again, he's completely impartial.

899
01:12:20,321 --> 01:12:23,521
Doesn't matter whether there's blood, doesn't matter whether they're family.

900
01:12:23,521 --> 01:12:25,761
If you kill somebody, that's bad.

901
01:12:25,761 --> 01:12:29,120
And he will, and you're guilty.

902
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:35,681
And any emotions that are partial are unjust and dangerous.

903
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:42,080
And the Furies, in effect, say, we may be not be impartial, but we're consistent.

904
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:44,880
We understand exactly what we're up to.

905
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:50,480
And we're the primitive moral outrage of the passions.

906
01:12:50,481 --> 01:12:54,721
And that's more basic than your law and order.

907
01:12:54,721 --> 01:12:57,200
That's what holds society together.

908
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,160
And we're not interested in your arguments.

909
01:13:01,441 --> 01:13:04,560
And the situation looks hopeless.

910
01:13:04,561 --> 01:13:08,240
That's my last comment on 143.

911
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:10,560
Where is the situation looking hopeless?

912
01:13:10,561 --> 01:13:11,200
Oh, yeah.

913
01:13:11,441 --> 01:13:14,000
They don't even believe in arguments, as they say.

914
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:19,120
Even if Apollo said exactly convincing things, like, look, you're inconsistent.

915
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:23,681
A revenge culture has contradictions in it.

916
01:13:23,681 --> 01:13:26,641
You can't be a rational being and have contradictions.

917
01:13:26,641 --> 01:13:29,440
They would say, so much the worse for being rational beings.

918
01:13:29,441 --> 01:13:30,800
We know what matters.

919
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:39,800
So they say it in the second chorus, little speech on 143, don't try to dock my privilege by argument.

920
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:43,160
So don't try, you can rationalize anything they're saying.

921
01:13:39,361 --> 01:13:45,721
It's strong feelings, that's what matters.

922
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:47,320
Okay, I got that there.

923
01:13:47,321 --> 01:13:49,240
Now, why do I stop there?

924
01:13:49,240 --> 01:14:00,920
Because the question, it looks hopeless, and you've got to have some something besides these two crazy opposed fanatical forces, the emotions and reason in their pure form.

925
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:02,120
Who could do that?

926
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:03,240
How would they do it?

927
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:05,800
Well, finish reading the humanities for next time.
