00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,641
We're beginning philosophy six from gods to God and back, which is also called man, God, and God, man, and society and Western literature as the sort of general name of Philosophy VI, which was around before I started giving it, and doing what I want to do, which is talk about polytheism and what it is and how great it was and how it would be nice if it came back.

2
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:29,440
That is the moral of the course.

3
00:00:29,441 --> 00:00:32,480
But so now, where were we?

4
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:44,641
I told you the assignment, and now I'm going to tell you how I think about the kind of course this is.

5
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:49,680
The first thing I want to do, you know what I want to do before any of that, is move this table.

6
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:50,961
Can somebody help me?

7
00:00:50,961 --> 00:00:55,120
I feel far away from everybody in a useless sort of way.

8
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,120
Why should we have this big empty space?

9
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,160
Yeah, that's all right.

10
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,160
Nothing's going to fall off, right?

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,360
Thanks.

12
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,641
Okay.

13
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:13,360
So, as a contribution to sort of truth in advertising, I have to tell you that this is like no other course in the department.

14
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:27,281
I tell you that partly just because you should know that don't take, if you go to other courses expecting them to be like this one, you're going to be shocked, maybe disappointed.

15
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:35,920
But it's a great books course, really, or I'll talk in a minute, a sense in which it's like and not quite like a great books course.

16
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,680
But one thing is sure, there isn't a single philosophy book in the reading.

17
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:50,360
It's these very, very important super classics that have focused a whole way of understanding everything.

18
00:01:50,680 --> 00:02:13,881
And I'm going to try to instead in philosophy courses, what you do is you try to find out what beliefs this person writing the philosophy book has, what theses they have, what arguments they have for their position, and try to then sort of test the arguments that they've got for the view that they've got.

19
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,841
This is different.

20
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:19,800
What we want to do is read these books and understand the understanding.

21
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,800
I'll explain this a lot more in a minute.

22
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:33,641
The understanding of being, to use this funny phrase, that this author has got in this book and see, sort of speak, how the world looks from that point of view.

23
00:02:33,641 --> 00:02:36,761
And that's a big job and hard enough.

24
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:46,441
And the author will try to get you to sort of empathize with and see the world from their point of view.

25
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:47,160
They can't help it.

26
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,841
That's their point of view.

27
00:02:48,841 --> 00:03:06,760
And that takes the place of what an argument for a belief system might be: is to be, as much as possible, led to see what it would have been like, say, to be a Homeric Greek, how things looked to them.

28
00:03:07,081 --> 00:03:09,721
I'll come back to that a lot today.

29
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:17,321
We try to explain by the end of the day, you should have a sense of what it means to talk about the various understandings of being.

30
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,721
Each of these books represents a very radically different understanding of being.

31
00:03:24,721 --> 00:03:35,201
So, but I want to distinguish, I said off the top of my head, sort of, that this is a great books course, but it's not the usual understanding of a great books course.

32
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:55,521
I once upon a time took a great books course, and what we were doing was reading these books, the great books, to discover what universal truths about what it is to be a human being and about God and about society and about nature that these great authors had captured and were giving us.

33
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,600
I'm calling that a humanist understanding of the great books.

34
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:23,361
Humanists could mean lots of different things, but one of the things it means, at least the way I'm going to use it, is somebody who believes that there is a human nature, there is some essential features of what it is to be a human being, and that the great books then contain insights into this nature.

35
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:41,201
And since we in the West are getting clearer and clearer about self and society and what it is to be a thing, what it is to be nature, and God and so forth, you read the great books to see how much of what we understand better they already understood.

36
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:43,440
It's a very smug way of reading books.

37
00:04:43,441 --> 00:04:49,681
I'll talk more about, read you a few quotes from people reading the Odyssey that way.

38
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,561
Now, there would be another way of reading these great books which would treat them as to say that they were works of art.

39
00:04:58,561 --> 00:05:04,241
I'm using this, this vocabulary is sort of mine, but I have to have ways to name these things.

40
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:13,880
If you think the book is a work of art, then you think that it shows you another world different from all.

41
00:05:15,321 --> 00:05:21,961
And maybe, in some ways, be better to be living in that world than in this one.

42
00:05:21,961 --> 00:05:38,281
It hasn't got this smug view that we know more than the people we're reading, but it's nice to see how much, given their darkness, their benighted state, Homer or Virgil or Dante managed to get right, or Shakespeare even better.

43
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,000
But that's not what I want to do.

44
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:57,641
But I'm going to read you one quote about looking at this stuff we're reading as great books so I can tell you, so you can see how different it would be, and I think how rare it is probably, to look at them as works of art.

45
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:06,361
That is, books that might teach us something that we don't know as modern Western European human beings.

46
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:14,360
So here's somebody named Kibby, who I don't even know who he is, and I don't care really, saying what a great book is.

47
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:20,521
And he's trying to persuade people that it's worth reading these classics like The Odyssey.

48
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:43,641
He says the most persuasive and influential defense of art, though I'm not sure it's not my sense of art, but anyway, in a humanistic education, see, that's why I want to call this the humanistic reading, in a humanistic education, centers around the belief that works of art, I'm going to put in great books every time he says, works of art, that the great books are sources of knowledge.

49
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:51,081
That artists like physicists, biologists, or economists are discoverers and teachers of truth.

50
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:57,441
That notice, the claim there, that there is some cross-cultural, universal sort of truth about human beings.

51
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:09,761
And just like a physicist can tell you the universal truth about nature, that there are electrons, for instance, with a certain spin and charge and weight and so forth, and that's true for everybody for all times.

52
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:21,521
Well, luckily, there are these very smart people writing these books who understand also truths not about nature, but about human beings.

53
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:40,481
So he says, going on with him, what defenders of the knowledge claim of the fine arts tell us is that we can find in the fine arts something that we cannot find in the natural sciences, something called humanistic knowledge, or better knowledge about ourselves as human beings.

54
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:50,401
Now, that suggests, you know, we, just like electrons have an essence and we can find out what it is, or gold has, and so forth.

55
00:07:50,401 --> 00:07:55,121
Human beings have some essential structures and we can find out what they are.

56
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:10,481
But the philosophers I like and teach, and in Philosophy 7, teach a bunch of them, are philosophers like Pascal, who's on your syllabus, because he's in this one, and Kierkegaard.

57
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,201
I'm not going to write them on the board since they're not in this course anyway.

58
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:16,240
Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Sark.

59
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:24,241
Heidegger, I have to write on the board because Heidegger is the secret person behind all of this.

60
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,321
Martin Heidegger.

61
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,280
He lived, I never know dates.

62
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,121
His big book was 1927, Being and Time.

63
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,600
And that he talks already about what he calls the understanding of being.

64
00:08:38,161 --> 00:08:43,560
But Heidegger, Heidegger's got a view about art, which I'm going to get to in a little while.

65
00:08:43,801 --> 00:08:54,441
But what Pascal, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Sartre all have in common is the claim that there's no universal truths about human beings.

66
00:08:54,441 --> 00:09:06,040
No interesting ones, maybe that they are featherless bipeds and they laugh and do, I mean, there are sort of accidental general truths about human beings, but no essential truths about human beings.

67
00:09:06,441 --> 00:09:18,841
If you knew them, you'd know, for instance, like if all human beings were essentially rational animals, as Aristotle said, you'd know a lot about what human beings could do and should do and shouldn't do and so forth.

68
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:28,441
But these existentialists all claim that there aren't any universal truths about human beings of any interest because they don't have any nature or any essence.

69
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:32,441
Well, how does that what why do we think that they do?

70
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:42,201
Well, because in each given culture, they have a way of understanding themselves as having an essence.

71
00:09:42,201 --> 00:09:48,841
And in fact, and Pascal is in here because he said custom is our nature.

72
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:55,081
Pascal was way super genius who was way ahead of everybody else already in, what, 1650.

73
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,041
He was the first existential thinker.

74
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:02,761
We'll come back to him when we read him, when we get to 1650.

75
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:17,880
But he said that when he says custom is our nature, he means that it's the social practices, to use a technical term, from another philosopher who's the two great philosophers of the 20th century.

76
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:23,920
It's now become pretty clear are Heidegger, Ludwig, Wittgenstein.

77
00:10:23,921 --> 00:10:28,801
They have a lot in common, although they hardly read each other.

78
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:30,000
Well, Heidegger certainly never read Wittgenstein.

79
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,841
Wittgenstein did read Heidegger and said he thought Heidegger was getting at something important.

80
00:10:35,841 --> 00:10:38,721
I see that you can't see that, and that's too bad.

81
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,721
Okay, so why am I putting that on there?

82
00:10:44,721 --> 00:10:48,961
Okay, so why am I?

83
00:10:50,081 --> 00:11:05,360
Heidegger and Wittgenstein, always for practices, the Wittgenstein term for all the ways we have of doing things that give us our understanding of what it is to be a human being.

84
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,161
This is what Pascal calls custom.

85
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:09,841
I'll come back to that too in a minute.

86
00:11:09,841 --> 00:11:17,761
I mean, it's all sorts of things like, I mean, how I always tend to try to say everything at once and get ahead of myself.

87
00:11:17,921 --> 00:11:19,121
We'll get to that.

88
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:39,840
Whatever it is, all the things that people do and say and the way they stand, here I'm saying it again, and the way they dress and what distance they stand from each other and how they greet each other and how the various genders are defined and how men are related, that is, to women, or really something more general like what counts as masculine and feminine.

89
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:43,201
All of that is the practices.

90
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:51,760
And all of that is what defines what it is to be a human being in any particular culture.

91
00:11:52,401 --> 00:12:03,681
Okay, so that so there's no universal cross-historical, cross-all cultures answer to what human beings are essentially.

92
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:23,961
Each culture defines for itself what human beings are essentially and enables them to live as if they do have some nature so that they know what they're here for and can have some kind of orientation as what's worth doing and what's not worth doing and what's good and what's bad and so forth.

93
00:12:23,961 --> 00:12:35,160
And as history changes, so do people's understanding of what it is to be a human being, what it is to be a thing, what it is to be nature, what it is to be a god.

94
00:12:35,161 --> 00:12:42,360
In this course we're going to see a huge spectrum of different understandings of what it is to be a god or god.

95
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:47,961
And in terms of each of these understandings, things show up in a certain way.

96
00:12:47,961 --> 00:12:58,520
People show up as heroes and slaves in the Homeric world, or heroes and just ordinary people.

97
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:06,040
And people show up or see themselves as saints and sinners in the medieval world.

98
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:11,000
That's a very, very different understanding of people and of the world.

99
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,161
I'm going to say more about that in a minute, too.

100
00:13:13,161 --> 00:13:17,160
This jargon of what people show up as is Heidegger talk.

101
00:13:17,161 --> 00:13:18,361
You need some kind of talk.

102
00:13:18,361 --> 00:13:22,280
It isn't what people are, because they don't have any nature.

103
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:29,961
And it isn't exactly what they become because other people in different cultures become different things.

104
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:37,800
It's not this picture that over the history of the human beings, they get clearer and clearer about what human beings are.

105
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:53,480
But in any given epoch in the history, or in any given culture, they show up, they understand themselves, they behave as if they were such and such, say, heroes or saints.

106
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:10,400
So the Greeks, for instance, have their own way of doing things, of greeting each other, of having these feasts together, of having their funeral events, and of fighting and dying.

107
00:14:10,401 --> 00:14:19,201
And you can't really say loving because that hadn't been invented exactly yet, but of relating in some deep way between men and women.

108
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:27,681
And that allowed people to show up as and to be, insofar as you can be anything.

109
00:14:27,681 --> 00:14:39,840
I mean, as long as you just don't think that to be it means to be it essentially, it allows people to be heroes and slaves and very wonderful women like Penelope waiting for Odysseus.

110
00:14:40,161 --> 00:14:51,921
But just to go through these more, because you've got to get a feel for what it is to have a world and have an understanding of being, the medieval practices are so different.

111
00:14:51,921 --> 00:14:56,480
I mean, they've got humility instead of heroes.

112
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,880
They've got confession, whereas the Greeks, heroes, the Homeric Greeks, didn't even have any inside.

113
00:15:05,441 --> 00:15:06,480
They cry a lot.

114
00:15:07,681 --> 00:15:10,721
When things go wrong, heroes cry.

115
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:21,520
And one of the brilliant things that Odysseus can do, who's cleverer and smarter than anybody, is to feel terrible grief and not cry.

116
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:28,320
His eyes remained as dry as stone, Homer says that this is a very that he had something inner.

117
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,441
He could do, that is just amazing.

118
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,240
Whereas, it's the Christians who really invented the inner.

119
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,761
Augustine, St.

120
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:46,921
Augustine, who we don't have time to read, has got a strong sense that what's really important is all secret and private inside.

121
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,160
And he has this wonderful story in the confessions about St.

122
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,120
Jerome.

123
00:15:52,121 --> 00:15:52,360
St.

124
00:15:52,441 --> 00:15:59,320
Jerome had a very, just like Odysseus had this very amazing quality that he could cry without his, with his eyes dry, St.

125
00:15:59,401 --> 00:16:01,800
Jerome could do something even more remarkable.

126
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,880
He could read to himself.

127
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:08,681
And people came and stood around to watch him reading the Bible without even moving his lips.

128
00:16:08,681 --> 00:16:12,520
He was communicating with himself inside.

129
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,721
And Augustine says that's just remarkable.

130
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:23,721
So the medievals had a lot to do with inventing our idea that we've got this private inner experience.

131
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:29,880
I think everybody knows they've got private inner experience and desires and dreams and fantasies and stuff.

132
00:16:29,881 --> 00:16:34,201
But what the Christians discovered was that that was crucially important.

133
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,280
Discovered is definitely the wrong word.

134
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:43,320
What the Christians just demonstrated in the way they lived it was crucially important.

135
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,480
For instance, confession was crucially important.

136
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:52,441
It was very important to know what your desires were and to tell them to other people to see if they were all right and acceptable.

137
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,641
The Greeks didn't Greeks didn't care about their desires.

138
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,881
They didn't even notice they had desires.

139
00:17:00,121 --> 00:17:12,921
But the medieval practices of confession, for instance, of prayer, of humility, and also the fact that there were tests for miracles, all that made it possible to be a saint or a sinner.

140
00:17:12,921 --> 00:17:20,681
And saints were loving and compassionate and, in a certain sense, weak.

141
00:17:20,681 --> 00:17:22,841
They turned the other cheek and so forth.

142
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,120
That wouldn't be possible in Athens.

143
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:30,000
It isn't that there were saints walking around in, well, not Athens, actually, that's a mistake, really.

144
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:36,080
I should say in Argos or on the battlefield where I had my pen.

145
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:43,841
But it wouldn't have been possible in Homeric Greece to be a saint.

146
00:17:44,401 --> 00:17:54,080
That kind of humble person who turned the other cheek, and in effect, let everybody else walk all over them, would be more like a slave.

147
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,560
And it wouldn't be possible to be a hero in medieval Christianity.

148
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:08,080
A hero is somebody who is so powerful and strong and self-sufficient that they don't need anybody to take care of them, and they're able to protect and take care of everybody else.

149
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,640
And people will sing songs about them at great dinner parties.

150
00:18:13,121 --> 00:18:19,921
That's not, from a Christian point of view, how one should be behaving and what one should be aiming for.

151
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:30,161
And Dante, as you'll see, puts Odysse in the way down in hell, which he's got ranking all the bad ways to be.

152
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,040
I think Odysseus is eight circles down out of, I don't remember, maybe ten.

153
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:51,121
So because Odysseus was so self-sufficient, and also because something which bothers Dante a lot, Odysseus was interested always in going where no one had ever gone before.

154
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,640
That was his whole idea, to have new experiences and see new things.

155
00:18:56,641 --> 00:19:00,961
That was not what you were supposed to do, according to Dante.

156
00:19:00,961 --> 00:19:05,041
And then there's us, thereby two stages.

157
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:13,800
There's modernity, which is the Enlightenment, which gets sort of focused by a philosopher named Kant.

158
00:19:15,401 --> 00:19:21,480
And what Kant said was the essence of modernity was maturity.

159
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:27,000
And what is maturity is to take responsibility for yourself and what you do.

160
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:36,360
And to be able to, in his language, give the moral law to yourself and justify what you're doing to yourself and to everybody else.

161
00:19:37,641 --> 00:19:40,121
That means, has lots of implications.

162
00:19:40,121 --> 00:19:45,400
You don't do what the king says you have to do or what the pope says you have to do.

163
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:51,080
You do what you understand that you should be doing.

164
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,961
And that's, but that's not ours anymore.

165
00:19:53,961 --> 00:19:59,000
I think we're postmodern, though people are having trouble trying to understand what it is to be postmodern.

166
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,320
Heidegger had his own views about it, and I think they're very interesting.

167
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:12,921
The test, sort of testing Heidegger, if I ask you, think to yourselves, what would you say you want to get up?

168
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:17,320
Not surely to be a hero that people sing about at dinner parties.

169
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,280
I doubt if very many of you want to be saints.

170
00:20:20,921 --> 00:20:27,400
I think a lot of you still are just modern and want to be mature and independent.

171
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:32,681
Kant says autonomous, which means something like self-sufficient and giving the law to yourself.

172
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:35,080
But I don't think even that's what it is anymore.

173
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:40,201
Nietzsche was the first to come across what it is to be postmodern.

174
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,721
How's this?

175
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,600
I mean, I can't ask you all to tell me that I'd love to hear.

176
00:20:46,601 --> 00:20:53,480
But when I ask myself this, my answer would be something like, well, I want to get the most out of my possibilities.

177
00:20:54,641 --> 00:21:02,800
That's, I think, sort of evidence for my feeling that that's what we all really think is in 2001.

178
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,520
I thought it was great in 2001 when Hal was being interviewed.

179
00:21:08,161 --> 00:21:14,800
on his, I guess it was his birthday on the ship, and they asked Hal, is he happy on the mission?

180
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:20,800
And you probably don't remember what he said, but he said, I'm using all my capacities to the utmost.

181
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,201
What more could a rational being want?

182
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:31,921
So he was getting the most out of his possibilities, and that's what, no, that isn't what any Kantian being wanted.

183
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:39,441
He wanted to understand the moral law and make it his own, so to speak.

184
00:21:39,441 --> 00:21:56,800
So, okay, so there's this whole history of understandings of, again, different whole understandings of what it is to be a human being, and with this goes understandings of what it is to be a social institution and what it is to be a thing.

185
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
I'll try to illustrate that in a minute.

186
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,840
It all adds up to a different, whole different style of behavior.

187
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:10,560
And now I hope you can understand why one might want to say it leads to a different understanding of being.

188
00:22:10,881 --> 00:22:19,280
Because it's not just what it is to be a table or a chair or even what it is to be a thing, but also what it is to be a person.

189
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:31,040
There's some general, well, all I can say is understanding, a a style or something that that goes th that that you live in.

190
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,441
And that's our, each culture's understanding of being.

191
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:38,161
Now, does anybody want to say anything, by the way?

192
00:22:38,201 --> 00:22:47,080
I mean, have I already said anything that seems to anybody outrageously wrong or terrifically right or whatever?

193
00:22:47,881 --> 00:22:48,361
Yeah.

194
00:22:48,681 --> 00:22:49,961
Wait, talk real loud.

195
00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:50,921
I can't hear you.

196
00:23:01,161 --> 00:23:06,201
Well, if you belie I mean, a culture could believe that there were human universal truths about humans.

197
00:23:06,201 --> 00:23:17,880
You ask, well, what about a culture which is based upon that there are human universal truths about humans and what that they've been found in their past and they now have them as their tradition or something?

198
00:23:18,201 --> 00:23:23,400
Oh, well, let me just say, well, in a way, every culture has that.

199
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:32,040
That's but if you're an existentialist, if you're gonna or if you believe this course, that's gonna turn out to be an illusion, not a bad illusion, a very good illusion.

200
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,480
But each culture thinks that they know what it is to be a human being.

201
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,921
The best thing is to be a hero.

202
00:23:36,921 --> 00:23:38,361
The best thing is to be a saint.

203
00:23:38,361 --> 00:23:40,280
The best thing is to be mature.

204
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,480
Somebody else must be built backwards.

205
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,800
Now, there we go.

206
00:23:46,921 --> 00:23:49,400
So anyway, yes.

207
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,361
No, different.

208
00:24:00,361 --> 00:24:00,841
Right.

209
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,241
Yes.

210
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:08,120
I mean, you were trying to find out in the medieval world what God's choice for you was, what your vocation was.

211
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:12,921
In fact, that would be one right answer to what do you want to get out of your life?

212
00:24:12,921 --> 00:24:15,240
Well, I don't know what I want to get out of my life.

213
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,721
I want to serve God, and I have to find out what He wants me to get out of my life.

214
00:24:19,721 --> 00:24:20,681
That's right.

215
00:24:20,681 --> 00:24:26,480
And for the heroes, they grow up in a role.

216
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:37,040
I mean, Odysseus hasn't got the choice as to whether he would rather withdraw and contemplate, or whether he wants to lead his people from Argos into the Trojan War.

217
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,721
That's what he has to do.

218
00:24:38,721 --> 00:24:40,560
Oh, you'll see that so clearly.

219
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:42,880
Well, let's wait till we read the Orestea.

220
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:51,921
The Orestea has got this big moment when Agamemnon has to seemingly make a choice, but it isn't a choice.

221
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:59,280
He finds out what he has to do, not by God's command or God's calling.

222
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,681
He doesn't have a calling, but he has a role.

223
00:25:01,681 --> 00:25:05,840
As king, there's something he has to do, and it's pretty terrible.

224
00:25:06,401 --> 00:25:10,240
Well, you probably, some of you know, he has to kill his own daughter.

225
00:25:10,641 --> 00:25:15,040
And that's, again, not a free choice.

226
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,040
Although he's free to not do it.

227
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,000
I mean, it's not as if it's a kind of fatalism.

228
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,921
Of course, if he does do it, he loses all of his self-respect as king and all of respect of his people.

229
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,841
Okay, so anything else?

230
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,561
I mean, that's good comments.

231
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,760
Okay, let's go on.

232
00:25:34,161 --> 00:25:47,921
I'm going to, I want you to, I'm still explaining the understanding of being, but I want to give you as a feel for how sort of deep it is and how unlike a bunch of beliefs it is.

233
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:55,441
I mean, in sociology, people sometimes think, and I'm fossil-that I'm talking about various belief systems.

234
00:25:55,441 --> 00:25:58,240
The Homeric belief system, the medieval belief system.

235
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,000
There's a bunch of beliefs, and they subscribe to a different bunch of beliefs.

236
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,201
It's not like that.

237
00:26:03,201 --> 00:26:05,921
It's much, much more basic.

238
00:26:05,921 --> 00:26:07,841
It isn't a mental thing at all.

239
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,520
It's a kind of body thing.

240
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:22,520
And to illustrate that, I found this account by a Maverick kind of sociologist, I imagine.

241
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,760
I don't know the person, and I don't even know if the account is right.

242
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,520
It doesn't matter whether it's right.

243
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:37,721
But they're going to tell you about the raising of very early, very young babies in Japan and in the United States.

244
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:50,120
Don't get hung up listening to it about the fact that it's all in sort of what looks to us now like sexist language, where the caretaker is always the mother and the baby is he and so forth.

245
00:26:50,681 --> 00:26:54,681
And don't worry about whether it's right about Japanese babies either.

246
00:26:54,681 --> 00:26:56,840
That's not the point is to get it right.

247
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:07,721
The point is to see a story, anyway, about how more deep than what you believe this understanding of being is.

248
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,361
A Japanese baby seems passive.

249
00:27:10,361 --> 00:27:17,240
He lies quietly while his mother in her care does a great deal of lulling, carrying, and rocking of her baby.

250
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:23,320
She seems to try to soothe and quiet the child, to communicate with him physically rather than verbally.

251
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:31,480
On the other hand, the American infant is more active and exploring of his environment, and his mother in her care does more looking at and chatting to her baby.

252
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,240
She seems to stimulate the baby to activity and vocal response.

253
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:42,201
It is as if the American mother wanted to have a vocal, active baby, and the Japanese mother wanted to have a quiet, contented baby.

254
00:27:42,201 --> 00:27:47,080
In terms of the styles of caretaking of the mothers in the two cultures, they get what they want.

255
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,320
A great deal of cultural learning has taken place by three or four months of age.

256
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,760
Babies have learned by this time to be chapanese and American babies.

257
00:27:53,641 --> 00:27:59,841
That is, they've got two radically different understandings of being.

258
00:28:00,161 --> 00:28:01,760
And it shows up everywhere.

259
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:11,921
The American baby is going to have lots of desires, individual desires, and it's going to be happy to have all those individual desires and cultivate its individuality.

260
00:28:11,921 --> 00:28:20,560
The Japanese baby on this story is going to have a lot of sense of integration into the family and into the workplace and into the culture.

261
00:28:20,961 --> 00:28:33,921
And the bottom line is the Japanese one will seek some kind of consensus and actually be able to arrive at consensus because people will be willing to give up their desires.

262
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:43,760
Whereas the most that the American baby is going to be able to do is reach a kind of compromise in which you keep your desires and I keep my desires, but I take a few.

263
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,081
I'll have to give up some of the things I want and you'll have to give up some of the things you want.

264
00:28:48,081 --> 00:28:57,681
But the idea that there could be some consensus in which we could find a way in which we did something that we all really wanted, that's not possible.

265
00:28:57,681 --> 00:28:59,441
It's not even desirable.

266
00:28:59,601 --> 00:29:08,960
And so the way the politics works in the culture, another, the way the relations between the people work is going to be different.

267
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,320
And it's, of course, not what the Japanese and American babies believe.

268
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,600
They don't believe anything.

269
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:18,721
It's a whole way of feeling and acting and sitting and standing.

270
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:29,521
Whether you take a rattle and listen to it like a rainstick, one of these quiet things that might put you to sleep, I picture that for the Japanese baby.

271
00:29:29,521 --> 00:29:35,040
Whereas you could use the rattle to make a lot of noise and throw and throw so that your parents have to go get it.

272
00:29:35,201 --> 00:29:39,401
That sounds to me more like what an American baby would do with the rattle.

273
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,800
So there you go.

274
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,561
So, oh, and things.

275
00:29:38,641 --> 00:29:45,321
You would have a different view of things.

276
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:52,041
I'm making all this stuff up now, but it's supposed to be to have some sense of this difference.

277
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:56,841
I take it a paradigm, perfect, wonderful thing might be a teacup.

278
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:03,961
It's traditional, it's beautiful, it's delicate, and so forth.

279
00:30:04,201 --> 00:30:06,360
That wouldn't be our perfect thing, I don't think.

280
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,321
Our best thing might be a styrofoam cup.

281
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:22,041
It keeps the old teacup doesn't keep this tea very hot, and if they had iced tea, it wouldn't keep it very cold, and you've got to be careful because it breaks, and you've got to keep it clean, and then you've got to have a place to stack it when you're not using it.

282
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:23,401
That's a drag.

283
00:30:23,641 --> 00:30:30,040
A styrofoam cup really keeps the tea hot, and the iced tea cold, and when you finish using it, you can just throw it away.

284
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,961
That's a good thing.

285
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:40,601
And so in every area, if you just think about it, you'll imagine at least that there could be these important differences.

286
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,120
Another one is that we just got into.

287
00:30:44,121 --> 00:30:48,600
Tradition is important, I take it, in a culture like the Japanese.

288
00:30:48,601 --> 00:30:50,920
And progress is the big deal in our culture.

289
00:30:50,920 --> 00:31:01,881
I mean, we're always getting doing things better than the people in the past, where there are plenty of cultures in which it seems the people in the past were doing things better and we're losing it.

290
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:08,521
And then maybe there are people, Japan is at any place close to it, where they are preserving their culture.

291
00:31:08,521 --> 00:31:10,040
Or did I just read yesterday?

292
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:11,960
I don't know whether this, what about this?

293
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:22,280
Maybe some of you do, that they want to have a test for using chopsticks to make sure that people aren't losing the skill of using chopsticks.

294
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,561
I mean, that's a very interesting thing to do, to care about.

295
00:31:26,561 --> 00:31:28,161
Okay, so let's see.

296
00:31:28,161 --> 00:31:33,760
And then there's something else, which I don't see how it relates directly to this, but it's important.

297
00:31:34,081 --> 00:31:35,440
Well, yes, I think it is.

298
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:41,120
There's gods, lots of gods, gods of the family, gods of the location where you are, and so forth.

299
00:31:41,121 --> 00:31:46,240
It's very different than this one monotheistic, voluntaristic God.

300
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:53,441
I mean, this God who just has all kinds of willful notions about what people should be doing.

301
00:31:53,440 --> 00:32:06,240
And whereas the thousands of gods in Japan are more or less just consecrating the sacredness of places, of families, of meals.

302
00:32:06,561 --> 00:32:11,041
I was in Japan for a month and teaching there, there's a God for exams.

303
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:12,641
There's a God for everything.

304
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,121
There are more gods than they've got names for.

305
00:32:15,121 --> 00:32:20,000
It's a very different way of thinking about things and not thinking, but experiencing things.

306
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:37,601
And again, so that's supposed to tell you that the understanding of being is even more deep than the practices because the practices are already somehow how people are behaving in their relation to the institutions and traditions and so forth.

307
00:32:37,601 --> 00:32:43,841
The baby's getting ready to take on different practices at this very basic level.

308
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,001
Okay, I'm going to read you one more.

309
00:32:46,641 --> 00:32:49,681
These are the kind of sociologists I like.

310
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,161
This one is a terrific guy.

311
00:32:52,161 --> 00:32:54,240
I'll write him up here.

312
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:09,161
It's not that you're ever going to come across him again unless you're in sociology, probably, but I like him a lot because he's so tuned into this understanding of being that we're talking about.

313
00:33:08,561 --> 00:33:10,360
Pierre Bourdieu.

314
00:33:10,681 --> 00:33:24,921
Pierre Bourdieu is a French sociologist who has this very Heideggerian sense of things, who told me once Heidegger was his first love in philosophy, if you can see it.

315
00:33:25,561 --> 00:33:34,601
He says, a whole group and a whole symbolically structured environment exerts an anonymous, pervasive pedagogic action.

316
00:33:34,601 --> 00:33:37,960
The essential part of the modus operandi, which defines...

317
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,320
He writes terribly, by the way.

318
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,561
That may be required for French sociologists.

319
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,360
I don't know.

320
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,520
No, it doesn't, because Lévi-Strauss was another.

321
00:33:46,681 --> 00:33:49,960
In fact, Bourdieu is just overthrowing Lévi-Strauss.

322
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,441
Every generation of French intellectuals destroys the life work of the previous one.

323
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,161
And this is all fancy Levi-Strauss.

324
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:58,681
The whole, okay, where were we?

325
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:11,641
Okay, the essential part of the modus operandi, which defines practical mastery, is transmitted in practice without attaining the level of discourse.

326
00:34:11,641 --> 00:34:14,920
That is, nobody thinks about it and nobody talks about it.

327
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,961
They just do it.

328
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,801
The child imitates not models, but other people's action.

329
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:28,921
Body hexes, that's sort of your, I think hexis sometimes means skill, but I hear it, I think it means something like posture or stance.

330
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,320
Where were we?

331
00:34:31,641 --> 00:34:46,601
Body hexes speaks directly to the motor function in the form of a pattern of postures that is both individual and systematic, because linked to a whole system of techniques involving the body and tools and charged with a host of social meanings and values.

332
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:55,361
In all societies, children are particularly attentive to the gestures and postures, which in their eyes express everything that goes to make an accomplished adult.

333
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:12,881
A way of walking, and now comes a nice list of these subtle things: a way of walking, a tilt of the head, facial expressions, ways of sitting, and of using implements, always associated with a tone of voice, a style of speech, and how could it be otherwise, a certain subjective experience.

334
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:28,481
So notice that subjective experience is now not this great special thing you are, your most private inner thing, but a kind of spin-off from this shared public way of behaving, all these practices.

335
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:39,040
And I want to just give you a few other examples because you've got to have this sense of what the understanding of being is, or the whole course gets lost on you.

336
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:41,120
So let me go on a little more about that.

337
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:54,961
So we've seen, okay, for Bourdieu, that the posture, gestures, style, and so forth reflects what it means to be competent, accomplished in a culture.

338
00:35:55,521 --> 00:36:06,481
And in our culture and in every culture, there are all these subtle things that nobody even notices or thinks about, which are helping define what it is to be a person.

339
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:12,560
My favorite example, it isn't one that Bourdieu mentions, he might have, is distance standing.

340
00:36:12,561 --> 00:36:16,080
In every culture, people stand different distance from each other.

341
00:36:16,081 --> 00:36:24,161
I mean, there are the up-close cultures like, say, North Africa, and there are the faraway cultures like Scandinavia.

342
00:36:24,161 --> 00:36:46,361
And John Searle, one of my colleagues, has this very funny story about how in an international meeting, you can see the people from, say, Algeria backing, somebody from Algeria backing somebody from Norway into a corner because the person from North Africa is trying to get near enough to have a conversation, and the person from Standing is trying to get far enough away to have a conversation.

343
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,961
And this just goes on, and you don't even notice it.

344
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:58,360
And your parents gave it to you, but they didn't notice it, but you're kids or babies are amazing imitation machines.

345
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,641
I mean, they pick it up.

346
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:03,721
We all picked it up without ever even noticing it was happening.

347
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,000
And it's complicated.

348
00:37:05,001 --> 00:37:15,721
You stand different distances from people if they're intimates with you, if they're strangers, if they're authorities, whether they're of the same sex or the opposite sex.

349
00:37:15,721 --> 00:37:21,080
And then you have all kinds of wonderful variations on the right distance to stand, even in your culture.

350
00:37:21,081 --> 00:37:28,840
A different distance if you're in a quiet reading room, and a different distance if the person you're talking to has the flu, but far away.

351
00:37:29,001 --> 00:37:32,521
If there's an air hammer in the background, it's okay to stand nearer.

352
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,161
And this isn't just a random thing, this distance standing.

353
00:37:37,161 --> 00:37:43,561
In cultures that are intimate with each other, they're putting their arms around each other more.

354
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,121
They're feeling more consensus-like.

355
00:37:48,121 --> 00:37:53,961
And in our culture, we want our independence, though not so far as the Norwegians.

356
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:59,721
And so the distance standing goes with hugging.

357
00:37:59,721 --> 00:38:01,721
It goes with putting your arm around people.

358
00:38:01,721 --> 00:38:03,561
It goes with who's able to kiss who.

359
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:16,201
A friend of mine who's Polish was just telling me, I didn't realize this, that the Russian men kiss each other on the mouth that you see on TV, Brezhnev kissing the prime minister, another man.

360
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,801
And this is just, I mean, that's how it is in that culture.

361
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,721
And so, and that goes with a whole lot of other relations between.

362
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:32,001
So, now, okay, I'm going to read you now one from what you're going to read later, and which you can now perhaps understand.

363
00:38:32,001 --> 00:38:39,121
Well, what we've been saying is: all understanding of the universe and of human beings is embodied in us, each of us.

364
00:38:39,121 --> 00:38:46,721
Okay, here's Melville saying it in a wonderful way that a writer can, just the opposite of Vourdieu's way of saying it.

365
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:50,321
So, Quiqueg, how many have read Moby Dick already?

366
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,520
Not so many.

367
00:38:51,521 --> 00:38:57,840
Okay, Quequeg is a savage, as Melville calls him, ironically.

368
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:06,401
He's a black guy who's a harpoonist, who's very, very wise and very, very different.

369
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,640
Many spare hours Quique spent in carving the lid of his coffin.

370
00:39:10,641 --> 00:39:21,280
He's dying, with all manner of grotesque figures and drawings, and it seemed that hereby he was striving in his rude way to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on his body.

371
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:31,121
And this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and earth.

372
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,280
Theory is a mistake on Melville's part.

373
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,841
It's not a theory, that's too intellectual.

374
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:42,081
A complete understanding of the heavens and the earth, and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth.

375
00:39:42,081 --> 00:39:53,280
So that Quiqueg, in his own person, was a riddle to unfold, a wondrous work in one volume whose mysteries not even he himself could read.

376
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:54,880
You see what he's saying there?

377
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:04,240
So, incarnated in you, in your body, are all these attitudes and skills and gestures and practices which you don't know about.

378
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,561
And if you did, you couldn't understand what they all mean.

379
00:40:07,201 --> 00:40:13,400
And they're much too complicated, well, subtle and cold and ramified.

380
00:40:14,201 --> 00:40:19,000
So Kweekweg is it, but he doesn't know it.

381
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:22,601
He can't read it, but he knows that it's sacred and valuable.

382
00:40:22,601 --> 00:40:26,361
and so sacred and valuable that he's carving it on his coffin.

383
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,800
And I won't tell you because it would be too much to give away the end of the book.

384
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:42,280
That coffin turns out can be very important because it's got on it, presumably, this kind of understanding of being, which is the most important, most valuable, most sacred thing you can have.

385
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,440
Because if you didn't have it, you wouldn't know what to do.

386
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:51,721
You wouldn't know what it was to be a human being, what to strive for, what to stand against and object to and so forth.

387
00:40:51,721 --> 00:40:54,841
And so Kweekweg is preserving that.

388
00:40:55,481 --> 00:41:02,520
And now a real artist, I mean, even more of an artist, a poet, says it most clearly and simply.

389
00:41:02,521 --> 00:41:03,880
I have a poster in my office.

390
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,360
I used to.

391
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,201
I haven't got it now any right now.

392
00:41:06,201 --> 00:41:11,881
Where Yeats says, man can embody truth, but he cannot know it.

393
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,001
That's the bottom line of what I've just been saying.

394
00:41:15,001 --> 00:41:17,800
Man can embody an understanding of being.

395
00:41:18,121 --> 00:41:18,840
It's interesting.

396
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,040
A student pointed out to me the last time I read this.

397
00:41:22,201 --> 00:41:23,160
I think it's good.

398
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:29,240
He doesn't say man can embody the truth as if there was only one.

399
00:41:30,601 --> 00:41:32,360
Each culture has its truth.

400
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:36,280
So he's saying man can embody truth, but he cannot know it.

401
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,641
And he's certainly not saying man has a theory about truth.

402
00:41:39,641 --> 00:41:41,960
That would be, that's the kind of thing you can know.

403
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,681
That's a little mistake in Melville.

404
00:41:44,681 --> 00:41:47,960
So, Yeats has got it completely right in one sentence.

405
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,401
I'll just say it again.

406
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,081
Man can embody truth, but he cannot know it.

407
00:41:53,681 --> 00:42:06,800
So, that finally gets us to the work of art has a very special relation to the fact that this understanding of being is absolutely important.

408
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:16,881
The whole culture lives out of it and understands everything in terms of it, and yet doesn't know it.

409
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:31,441
Looks like with this understanding of being, which isn't in the mind, but in the general style of the culture, is invisible, must be invisible, and stay in the background because it's so pervasive and so subtle.

410
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,161
It would be like water to the fish.

411
00:42:34,481 --> 00:42:41,760
In Heidegger language, the understanding of being is nearest to us and therefore furthest away.

412
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:50,401
See, if you just are, if you are it and everybody around you is it, then you live in it, but you don't see it.

413
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,120
So, how do people ever become aware of it?

414
00:42:53,121 --> 00:42:56,000
And why would it be important to become aware of it anyway?

415
00:42:56,001 --> 00:43:02,081
If you are, if you are it, just be happy you are it and go about your business.

416
00:43:02,081 --> 00:43:37,921
But it's important, it turns out, that to really live whatever life your culture wants you to live, that you see it and you share it with others, and you share the fact that you all share it, because that way you can live more in line with it, and you have it, and you have a sense that you can preserve it and enhance it, and even, if need be, rebel against it and change it.

417
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:49,161
Our big rebelling against it and change, refers to in the Gospel of John, that they're there, or Martin Luther King, or that would be the current one, very, very current.

418
00:43:49,161 --> 00:43:56,520
I mean, he certainly had enough of an understanding of the practices that he could see what was wrong with them.

419
00:43:56,521 --> 00:44:00,681
And he could, he was a work of, he was a work of art, in a way.

420
00:44:00,681 --> 00:44:05,321
Heidegger thinks works of art don't have to be paintings and temples and poems.

421
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:13,641
They can be people who are, in a sense, martyrs to a new way or a change.

422
00:44:13,641 --> 00:44:16,040
I mean, really, Martin Luther King is a good example.

423
00:44:16,041 --> 00:44:34,601
I haven't really thought about it, but because what he's doing is preserving and focusing and making more coherent our understanding of being, our understanding of people and of society and so forth.

424
00:44:34,601 --> 00:44:41,321
And to do that, he also has to make it, has to hold it up to the people who share it.

425
00:44:42,121 --> 00:44:43,961
So now we're talking about that.

426
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:59,960
There are people and objects like temples and cathedrals and thinkers like philosophers whose job it is to hold up to the people and show them what they are up to.

427
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,881
Ooh, I skipped something here.

428
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:07,881
Before there are works of art that do that, there's something more fun that more primitive that does that.

429
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,361
And that is myths and rituals.

430
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:17,560
The myths and the rituals already sort of dramatize and hold up to the people, what they're up to and what's important.

431
00:45:19,161 --> 00:45:50,800
Another sociologist, anthropologist, Clifford Geiritz, who is a big hero in this line of people, has a very famous article called The Cock Fight in Bali, in which he shows in great detail how what it is to get the cock and to train it and to bet on it in the fight and to be able to accept losing and know how to also sort of triumph in when your bird is the one that wins and so forth.

432
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:56,721
A whole understanding of what it is to be a masculine is built into the cock fight.

433
00:45:56,721 --> 00:45:59,360
And the women have their rituals.

434
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:08,001
It happens to be weaving in Bali, which I gather has to do with sort of unity and community and bringing people together.

435
00:46:08,001 --> 00:46:16,240
It certainly doesn't have to do with having fights and being able to accept victory and accept defeat and triumph and so forth.

436
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:25,041
It's a different understanding of being, but they're both Bali understandings of being in a way that I don't, well, I don't know what Geertz would say about this.

437
00:46:25,041 --> 00:46:35,520
Because what's interesting is that there doesn't seem to be a ritual or myth or anything that holds up the unified Bali understanding of being.

438
00:46:35,521 --> 00:46:38,801
There is one for the men and one for the women.

439
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,601
A work of art is one stage beyond that.

440
00:46:41,601 --> 00:46:54,401
It holds up for everybody whatever it is that is the unifying thing that makes you a Greek or a Christian or there is no unifying thing in Bali, I think.

441
00:46:55,121 --> 00:46:59,040
They turn out, if you look at their gods, I'm sure they must be a polytheistic culture.

442
00:46:59,041 --> 00:47:03,361
There must be a god for weaving and a god for cock fights and a god for other things.

443
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:26,441
But a work of art is holds up the understanding of being for the people and focuses it and glamorizes it so that the people can see and appreciate their particular style, their understanding of being.

444
00:47:28,041 --> 00:47:34,441
And they can share it and they can consciously guide their lives by it.

445
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:39,321
And it gives them this moral space so that they can, for instance, Homer did it.

446
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,800
He showed people what it was to be heroes.

447
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:50,681
And they could then be more guided by the hero possibilities than they had before.

448
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:52,681
And it surely glamorizes it.

449
00:47:52,681 --> 00:48:00,841
Oh, impressive in the Odyssey, as you'll see, and in the Iliad in a different way, but equally amazing.

450
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:07,481
So here's Heidegger now, summing up what he says the work of art does.

451
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:19,321
So remember now, the work of art, just to say it again, focuses, glamorizes, and unifies and makes coherent the understanding of being.

452
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:24,121
So in Heidegger's jargon, he takes a Greek temple as an example.

453
00:48:24,121 --> 00:48:42,441
He says, it is the temple that fits together and at the same time gathers around the unity of those paths and relations in which birth and death, disaster and blessing, victory and disgrace, endurance and decline acquire the shape of destiny for human beings.

454
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:52,441
The all-governing, notice it's unified now, the all-governing expanse of this open relational context is the world of this historical people.

455
00:48:52,760 --> 00:49:04,880
So when you get enough unity and also to have a history, you get it, partly at least, because there are these works that do it.

456
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,400
You see, now we're at great works.

457
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,800
I mean, a temple is a work, and so is the Odyssey.

458
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,320
It's a very great work.

459
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:16,960
It gives the Greeks the whole picture of what it is to be a king, what it is to be a father.

460
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:24,641
You'll see what it is to be a son, what it is to be a wife, a hero, of course, and so forth.

461
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:32,641
They've got their model in there, and they've got their picture of, and what it is to be a god, of course, and how all that hangs together.

462
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:47,841
It manifests and holds up to them what it is to be a Homeric Greek, a Roman, for instance, Augustus, who they took to be a god, and he was a work of art.

463
00:49:48,481 --> 00:49:51,600
Works of art and gods have lots in common.

464
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:59,280
They sort of unify and dramatize and glamorize whatever it is that's important in the culture.

465
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:04,401
And it's important now just to say a few things that it's not, again.

466
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,961
It's not something that represents something else.

467
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,840
That's, again, it would be a belief system.

468
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:15,760
You have a bunch of beliefs and they represent the way the culture is going.

469
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:28,561
Heidegger says he particularly wants to write about the Greek temple as a work of art, because, unlike, say, a book, because you can't imagine that, I mean, you couldn't imagine that the Greek temple represented anything.

470
00:50:28,561 --> 00:50:29,600
What would it represent?

471
00:50:29,601 --> 00:50:34,081
I mean, the book might represent the culture, get an accurate description of it.

472
00:50:34,081 --> 00:50:37,441
But the temple isn't an accurate description of anything.

473
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:51,400
But it is nonetheless a way that these people can see in the way it's made, and in the way the pillars are, and the way the friezes, and everything about it, what they care about, what matters in their culture.

474
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,601
The perfect example is surely medieval cathedral.

475
00:50:54,601 --> 00:50:56,040
How many of you have been to Europe already?

476
00:50:56,041 --> 00:50:57,401
Probably everybody.

477
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,480
So you've been in the cathedrals.

478
00:50:59,481 --> 00:51:07,721
I mean, there the Christians can read everything that is and feel everything that is essential to Christianity.

479
00:51:07,721 --> 00:51:11,001
It's in Heidegger language a work of art.

480
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:15,880
And Heidegger says the temple portrays nothing, which is, that's right.

481
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,840
But it shines in Heidegger language.

482
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,760
What does it mean to say it shines?

483
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:27,961
It means that, and you can see it better in the cathedral, people see everything in its light.

484
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:32,681
That's my sort of way to put the, why does Heidegger want to say it took me years?

485
00:51:32,681 --> 00:51:33,400
I couldn't understand.

486
00:51:34,201 --> 00:51:36,681
The cathedral didn't look very shiny to me.

487
00:51:36,681 --> 00:51:56,841
And then I see that what he means is that in the light of this perfectly clear, glamorized version of their understanding of being, they can see everything else as more or less living up to it.

488
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,481
I want to see something here.

489
00:52:02,121 --> 00:52:05,240
No, I guess I didn't write it down, but I think it helps to think.

490
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:16,441
Now, so one of the ways this gets done is by gods, particularly in Homer, but it gets done by gods and goddesses even now.

491
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,481
And then my favorite example is Marilyn Monroe.

492
00:52:19,481 --> 00:52:23,081
It's no coincidence that she was a goddess, people say.

493
00:52:23,081 --> 00:52:25,680
And it's no coincidence that she was a star.

494
00:52:25,681 --> 00:52:27,201
Stars shine.

495
00:52:28,001 --> 00:52:31,121
What did she do that made her a goddess and made her shine?

496
00:52:31,121 --> 00:52:46,240
She was an exemplar, a paradigm of a certain way of being a woman, so that women could understand themselves in terms of how much they were similar to her style.

497
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:53,041
And men could relate to the women in the way men related in the movies to Marilyn Monroe.

498
00:52:53,041 --> 00:52:55,760
They could see their relationship.

499
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:01,760
The women could see who they were, what women were, and the men could see their relationship to women in the light of her.

500
00:53:03,121 --> 00:53:29,601
She wasn't a total work of art because she certainly didn't unify all the aspects of the culture, but she was a goddess which did a kind of job of focusing, of making more clear, of glamorizing something that gave a kind of direction to a certain aspect of what people were doing.

501
00:53:30,161 --> 00:53:33,201
I think that helps understand why.

502
00:53:33,201 --> 00:53:35,440
And of course, she doesn't represent anything.

503
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,120
She's not a copy of anything.

504
00:53:37,121 --> 00:53:38,961
She doesn't symbolize anything.

505
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,320
All that doesn't get at what it is to be a work of art.

506
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:45,041
She manifests something and shows it.

507
00:53:45,041 --> 00:53:55,200
And in the light of it, people can see all around them Marilyn Monroe and people and how far other people fall short of being Marilyn Monroe's.

508
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:02,401
And so a work of art is just a big deal of a kind of star like that.

509
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,521
It glamorizes a whole way of life.

510
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:10,361
It shines, and people see themselves in the light of it.

511
00:54:10,681 --> 00:54:15,721
In one sort of fancy talk for it, I want to call it a cultural paradigm.

512
00:54:15,721 --> 00:54:17,240
Remember, I said exemplar.

513
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:22,921
Paradigm and exemplar are names, a super good example of whatever they are.

514
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:23,881
things.

515
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,880
How many of you probably don't know yet Kuhn?

516
00:54:26,121 --> 00:54:29,240
How many of you Kuhn's structure of scientific revolutions?

517
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:33,400
That's a book in which the notion of paradigm became central.

518
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:44,920
And he said every, in science, you've got to have one exemplary work of that science, like Newton's Principia, and then all the other scientists can see what they're doing in the light of it.

519
00:54:45,161 --> 00:54:47,400
Kuhn never read Heidegger as far as I know, though.

520
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,240
I told him to every time I saw him.

521
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:54,681
But he had a very Heideggerian sensibility as to this kind of work of art thing.

522
00:54:54,681 --> 00:54:55,960
It works in science.

523
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,000
It works everywhere.

524
00:54:57,161 --> 00:55:04,681
There is something embodies and holds up to people the best version of what they're up to.

525
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:12,921
Now, that means that to appreciate these works of art, one doesn't have aesthetic experiences.

526
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:17,081
Heidegger is very much against the idea of aesthetic experiences.

527
00:55:17,641 --> 00:55:32,041
If you go into a Greek temple or the medieval cathedral and feel ooh and ah, and isn't that moving, you're missing what it was really doing, and it was a work of art.

528
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:34,601
It's dead, according to Heidegger.

529
00:55:34,601 --> 00:55:35,161
It's all right.

530
00:55:35,161 --> 00:55:44,041
I mean, he doesn't care if you want to go ooh and ah, and that's the best you can do because they're not organizing a culture anymore, a Greek temple or a medieval cathedral.

531
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:48,521
And you can't experience them the way the Greeks did or the Christians did.

532
00:55:48,681 --> 00:55:51,640
So, Christianity is still around, and some people take.

533
00:55:51,641 --> 00:55:59,521
But if you're just there as a spectrum, you're missing the work of art as it was when it was working.

534
00:55:59,521 --> 00:56:01,201
This is sort of the Heidegger pun.

535
00:56:01,201 --> 00:56:10,480
When a work of art works, it shines and unifies the understanding of being, stabilizes it, holds it up to the people.

536
00:56:10,481 --> 00:56:20,081
And when it works, it gives us another quote from Heidegger: the temple first gives to things their look and to men their outlook on themselves.

537
00:56:20,081 --> 00:56:21,280
That's just another way.

538
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:27,041
There are many, many ways of trying to say this rather novel idea.

539
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:36,560
And then Heidegger equates the temple with a God because gods do this job of focusing and shining.

540
00:56:36,561 --> 00:56:40,721
So he says, by means of the temple, the God is present in the temple.

541
00:56:40,721 --> 00:56:42,401
That's his first way of putting it.

542
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,041
And he says it's not a portrait of the God.

543
00:56:46,081 --> 00:56:48,561
It doesn't matter to see how the God looks.

544
00:56:48,561 --> 00:56:53,921
The work lets the God be present, and thus the work is the God Himself.

545
00:56:53,920 --> 00:57:02,161
This is beginning to see, you have to see why the polytheism course and the fact that we're reading great works are related to each other.

546
00:57:02,161 --> 00:57:22,961
Great works, like the Odyssey, do this job of, in effect, creating the culture by holding it together and making it coherent and holding it up and unifying it and gives meaning to the life of the people who live in the light of it.

547
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:28,721
All that Heidegger thinks is the job also, and especially, of God.

548
00:57:28,721 --> 00:57:33,200
And that we have to look into, but we aren't ready for that yet.

549
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:41,160
But the works of art, then give people a world.

550
00:57:41,481 --> 00:57:44,681
You can't, it's not exactly like they create a world.

551
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:50,840
You could, if they were a creator god, just produce a world, like the Christian God did.

552
00:57:51,161 --> 00:57:57,161
But the idea is that something like the Greek temple produces heroes and saints.

553
00:57:57,161 --> 00:58:03,721
Only produces isn't the right word, creates isn't the right word, but it isn't inventing it out of nowhere either.

554
00:58:03,721 --> 00:58:06,600
You need something, we need some technical term.

555
00:58:06,601 --> 00:58:14,441
And so I want to say works of art constitute people as the kinds of human beings they are.

556
00:58:15,001 --> 00:58:25,401
Given their works of art, they're going to show up to themselves and everybody else as heroes or slaves or loyal wives and so forth.

557
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,840
And that's the job of works of art.

558
00:58:29,161 --> 00:58:30,360
Yeah, Beatrice.

559
00:58:33,721 --> 00:58:36,440
I think it's better for what it couldn't be off even the works of art.

560
00:58:36,681 --> 00:58:37,961
Ah, okay.

561
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,640
You're way ahead of the story.

562
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:41,961
But I can tell you this much now.

563
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,361
There are really two kinds of works of art.

564
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:48,680
And I haven't distinguished them, but I will distinguish them now.

565
00:58:49,001 --> 00:58:54,841
The ones I've been talking about, I want to say are articulating works of art.

566
00:58:54,840 --> 00:59:09,881
That is, they make clearer and more coherent whatever understanding of being there is in the culture already and draw people into preserving it and making it even clearer and so forth.

567
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:16,521
But then there are another, just I have to have words for this, reconfiguring works of art.

568
00:59:16,521 --> 00:59:26,801
A reconfiguring work of art does what Beatrice over there says, don't they sometimes change the culture, radically change the culture.

569
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:40,560
That's the most extreme and it's very, very interesting and very hard to do because you you have to somehow and I am I'm not ready to talk about it yet, I don't think.

570
00:59:40,561 --> 00:59:41,760
Let me see.

571
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:48,081
Well, I'll say it, although you need a lot more to show it.

572
00:59:48,081 --> 00:59:51,280
I won't be able to show it until I get to the Gospel of John again.

573
00:59:51,601 --> 00:59:56,080
Jesus is an articulating work of art in this sense.

574
00:59:56,081 --> 00:59:59,361
He changes radically, changes the culture.

575
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:04,401
But you can't change it completely radically, or nobody will understand what you're doing.

576
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,161
Even you won't understand what you're doing.

577
01:00:06,161 --> 01:00:10,161
You won't be able to tell the difference between that you'll just be crazy.

578
01:00:10,161 --> 01:00:13,681
But so it's very interesting, and I'm not going to tell you how yet.

579
01:00:13,681 --> 01:00:25,040
You have to be able to, so to speak, change the culture from the inside in such a way that it's radically different, and yet you have to do it in such a way that it's not so radically different.

580
01:00:25,041 --> 01:00:29,201
And then you that's what reconfiguring works of art do.

581
01:00:29,201 --> 01:00:31,760
And you're right, that's the most interesting kind.

582
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,641
We don't get to that until we get to the Gospel of John.

583
01:00:34,641 --> 01:00:50,641
Because all the ones we read, the Iliad, the Oristea, the Aeneid, which was actually sort of commissioned to be a work of art by Augustus, who just said to Virgil, all those were articulating works of art.

584
01:00:50,641 --> 01:01:02,561
But then there are these reconfiguring ones, and we'll get there when we get to and and and the Gospel of John, more than any of the other Gospels, is sort of tuned into that.

585
01:01:03,121 --> 01:01:04,001
Okay.

586
01:01:04,001 --> 01:01:04,960
Anything else?

587
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:05,400
Yeah?

588
01:01:12,681 --> 01:01:13,880
Personality?

589
01:01:14,521 --> 01:01:16,120
No, no, but it's good to ask.

590
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,801
I have to repeat these.

591
01:01:18,601 --> 01:01:19,561
I still couldn't hear you.

592
01:01:19,561 --> 01:01:20,601
Loud, loud.

593
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:21,400
Difference.

594
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:21,880
Okay.

595
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:25,961
The question is, and I have to do this for the podcast people.

596
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:29,881
The question is: is being like personality?

597
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:32,201
And if not, what's the difference?

598
01:01:32,201 --> 01:01:38,520
Well, personality is just a tiny part of understanding what it is to be a person, what it is to be a thing.

599
01:01:38,521 --> 01:01:40,360
And go back to my teacup example.

600
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:45,401
The understanding of being dictates whether you like teacups or styrofoam cuffs more.

601
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,961
It's much broader than personality.

602
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:55,401
It's the whole style of what counts as interesting and valuable in the culture.

603
01:01:55,400 --> 01:02:00,841
And even the very idea, although that's one point, it's broader.

604
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:09,960
But also, it's somehow personality is already an understanding of being.

605
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:16,440
I don't think the Comeric Greeks were personalities or the saints either.

606
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:19,641
I mean, saints may be getting closer because they had this inner.

607
01:02:19,641 --> 01:02:35,161
But, and I don't, what it is to be a personality, which is what it is to be a one view of what it is to be a person, that is to have your own style and your own ideas and so forth.

608
01:02:35,161 --> 01:02:38,280
Maybe that's nearest to the Kantian Enlightenment thing.

609
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,681
Is that where personalities get into the story?

610
01:02:40,681 --> 01:02:42,681
I haven't thought of it that way.

611
01:02:42,681 --> 01:02:46,040
But you want the saints to be sort of self-effacing.

612
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:49,800
They don't want to be personalities or have personalities.

613
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,920
They want to be channels to God's love.

614
01:02:52,920 --> 01:03:00,641
So, anyway, so it's too special, it's too restricted, and it's already part.

615
01:03:00,641 --> 01:03:06,000
To be a personality is already to have a certain understanding, I think, of what it is to be a human being.

616
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,760
I think it goes with having some inner truth and inner experience.

617
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,360
It goes with a kind of romantic, romanticism.

618
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,561
To be a personality is to be very specially unique.

619
01:03:20,561 --> 01:03:21,681
That's part of it.

620
01:03:21,681 --> 01:03:30,880
And uniqueness is certainly not something that the Homeric Greeks and certainly not something the medieval Christians were wanted to value.

621
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,320
Anything else?

622
01:03:32,401 --> 01:03:33,280
Cow?

623
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:34,080
Yeah.

624
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:34,641
Wait a minute.

625
01:03:34,641 --> 01:03:36,080
What am I doing here?

626
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:37,521
Go ahead.

627
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,601
Keep going to marry me theories.

628
01:03:44,401 --> 01:03:46,400
Well, it's okay.

629
01:03:46,401 --> 01:03:47,200
Good.

630
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:52,320
So, what's the why do I say works of art are not representations?

631
01:03:52,321 --> 01:03:58,561
Well, representations seem to want to sort of copy.

632
01:03:58,561 --> 01:04:02,561
Mimesis is the humanist word for what happened in a work of art.

633
01:04:02,561 --> 01:04:05,280
They copy what's going on there.

634
01:04:05,281 --> 01:04:09,120
Copying is not strong enough.

635
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:15,040
They have to articulate is to focus it in a way that it wasn't there yet.

636
01:04:15,441 --> 01:04:21,681
So the Greek temple can't be representing, so to speak, Greek beliefs and Greek values.

637
01:04:21,681 --> 01:04:26,721
That's all too mental and intellectual.

638
01:04:26,681 --> 01:04:31,120
And also, and also now I'm adding, it's like there's something to copy.

639
01:04:32,241 --> 01:04:38,000
The thought of getting a work of art is that you've got to articulate it, focus it.

640
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,641
Of course, I see what you're thinking.

641
01:04:38,481 --> 01:04:41,561
You can't just come out of nowhere.

642
01:04:41,721 --> 01:04:55,080
It's out of the culture that you do it, but it's not as if the representation could, I don't know, get it getting it right.

643
01:04:55,080 --> 01:05:01,641
You've got to actually make it shine more and integrate it more than what you are copying.

644
01:05:01,641 --> 01:05:04,360
And that's the sense in which it's not a copy.

645
01:05:05,321 --> 01:05:06,520
It does something.

646
01:05:06,521 --> 01:05:09,641
A representation just copies something.

647
01:05:09,641 --> 01:05:15,800
A work of art actually produces a certain understanding in the people who experience it.

648
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:21,721
But it's got to be that culture, that sensibility that it's articulating.

649
01:05:21,721 --> 01:05:25,320
In that much looser sense of representation, it does.

650
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:29,641
Here, in Heidegger language, he says it's not a representation and it's not a symbol.

651
01:05:29,641 --> 01:05:30,760
Maybe this will help.

652
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:34,840
He says symbols refer to something beyond themselves.

653
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:41,240
They get their value and truth in how well they r correspond and represent.

654
01:05:41,241 --> 01:05:46,601
But the the Greek temple doesn't refer to some something beyond itself.

655
01:05:46,601 --> 01:05:54,601
It it's there to be the thing itself, to manifest something, and not to point towards something else.

656
01:05:54,601 --> 01:05:56,520
Symbols point towards something else.

657
01:05:56,521 --> 01:05:59,000
Representations copy something else.

658
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,240
The work of art doesn't do that.

659
01:06:01,241 --> 01:06:07,480
It it because I when I put it glamorizes, focuses, articulates, something like that.

660
01:06:07,481 --> 01:06:09,160
You don't look completely convinced.

661
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:15,400
But I I see the truth in what you're saying, but I want to play it down and try to bring out the other half of it.

662
01:06:15,401 --> 01:06:17,160
Uh okay.

663
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,360
Let me yeah.

664
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:24,240
But with the cathedral, because it there t does the cathedral represent something beyond itself?

665
01:06:24,241 --> 01:06:29,840
Well, if it does, how do I put this?

666
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:36,000
It could be seen to be doing that, to be symbolizing God or representing God or something like that.

667
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,200
Is that what you're thinking?

668
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:42,160
But I think Heidegger would say that would be a mistaken way to think about it.

669
01:06:42,641 --> 01:06:48,320
It's the cathedral itself that's doing the job of producing the Christian culture in Heidegger's view.

670
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:53,280
And part of what it's doing is producing a certain understanding of God.

671
01:06:53,281 --> 01:06:55,920
But it's not pointing beyond itself.

672
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,681
It's the center of it all in his picture.

673
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,040
Okay, let me go back to this.

674
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:01,920
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

675
01:07:02,561 --> 01:07:03,360
Oh, yeah, okay.

676
01:07:03,441 --> 01:07:03,760
Yeah.

677
01:07:12,721 --> 01:07:13,120
Okay.

678
01:07:14,401 --> 01:07:20,641
So what she's saying is, I'm saying that when I say works of art aren't, they're not really working.

679
01:07:20,641 --> 01:07:28,000
If they're giving you a certain feeling, you could add things like ob art, which is working when it makes you see things a certain way.

680
01:07:28,321 --> 01:07:36,641
And you're saying, and certain works of art are there to provoke you to have certain feelings of, I don't know, disgust or delight and all that.

681
01:07:36,641 --> 01:07:41,360
I think the answer is what we call works of art is very, very broad.

682
01:07:41,361 --> 01:07:44,880
But Heidegger just happens to have his own story.

683
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:49,920
And he would have to say, he would just declare that those things are doing things.

684
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:56,800
They're giving you experiences, visual and emotional, and the right reaction might well be, ah.

685
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:03,681
But in his terms, when a work of art is working, he's got this sort of technical sense.

686
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:08,000
What the work of art is doing when it's working is focusing a culture.

687
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,521
It's just a kind of, I think, on his point of view, an accident that we call them both art.

688
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:14,440
We call all sorts of things art.

689
01:08:14,441 --> 01:08:25,800
And if you had to ask him, I think he'd say, well, there's one special function or an object or what else?

690
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:27,321
I don't know.

691
01:08:27,481 --> 01:08:29,800
At least people and objects could have.

692
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:30,840
I'm sure there are other things.

693
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,960
And built things could have, but natural things could have.

694
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:37,880
What could they all have in common that would make them works of art working?

695
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:41,400
Well, it could only be this focusing and shining.

696
01:08:41,401 --> 01:08:49,080
So let's say that that's the interestingest or best thing that art can do.

697
01:08:49,721 --> 01:08:52,360
But it's interesting that he can't do it anymore.

698
01:08:52,361 --> 01:08:54,440
So now art has to do other things.

699
01:08:54,441 --> 01:08:58,601
Focus your feelings, give you shock or give you awe.

700
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:05,800
Well, awe is better for the cathedral, but give you feelings because there isn't anything anymore that can focus our culture.

701
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:08,200
I don't know whether it's exactly why it is.

702
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,280
I think it's because our culture doesn't have a unified.

703
01:09:10,601 --> 01:09:11,561
No, it isn't.

704
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:13,800
That would be too hard to explain.

705
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:22,440
According to Heidegger, our culture has a unified understanding of being, namely that everything is resources, but that's not an understanding of being that you can focus.

706
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:23,080
Yeah.

707
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:32,681
Is it that the work of art has to have a kind of human memory?

708
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:39,561
It has to take up the tradition that people are living in.

709
01:09:39,561 --> 01:09:42,120
In that sense, a kind of memory.

710
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:42,760
Yeah.

711
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:44,280
Let's see now where we are.

712
01:09:44,281 --> 01:09:45,320
I've got three more minutes.

713
01:09:45,321 --> 01:09:47,800
I just want to see to get to some end here.

714
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,400
I think I am pretty much.

715
01:09:50,601 --> 01:09:53,521
So the work, I'm going to just say three minutes of things.

716
01:09:53,521 --> 01:10:04,320
The works of art we read at this semester, except for Pascal and Moby Dick, because they're already past the point where you can do it, maybe, or at least Moby Dick is.

717
01:10:04,321 --> 01:10:06,721
They do the job of the temple and the cathedral.

718
01:10:06,721 --> 01:10:10,320
They unify and hold up to the people their understanding of being.

719
01:10:10,321 --> 01:10:17,601
That is, I said, that's what Homer and Aeschylus and Virgil and Dante do, each in their own way, which we'll talk about.

720
01:10:17,601 --> 01:10:24,800
And perhaps there's nothing doing that job for us now, and maybe there never will be again.

721
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:32,800
And maybe, therefore, we have to think differently about what gods are and what work, how works of art could work.

722
01:10:33,281 --> 01:10:44,080
But we're going to do the Homer, classical Greek, Roman, medieval, and modern world and see how each of them is focused in a work.

723
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:48,481
See, but Moby Dick doesn't have anybody all, nobody, it doesn't unify the culture.

724
01:10:48,481 --> 01:10:53,681
Not everybody says, ah, Moby Dick, that's what tells us what we really are and what we're all about.

725
01:10:53,681 --> 01:10:59,200
And it's the, but I think Nelville's trying, and he does more than most.

726
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,960
Okay, now let's see what else.

727
01:11:01,441 --> 01:11:06,401
Okay, one last remark: that obviously there are lots of different meanings of God that I've been using.

728
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,880
Since it's in the title, I owe you something to say something about that.

729
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:18,481
There is, and we're used to, the Judeo-Christian monotheistic creator God, or at least a lot of us are.

730
01:11:18,481 --> 01:11:19,601
A lot of us aren't, too.

731
01:11:19,601 --> 01:11:24,400
This is no longer simple, homogeneous Western culture.

732
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:32,880
But certainly the dominant understanding of God right around here is this monotheistic creator God view.

733
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:57,721
And then there are works of art like the Greek temple or like Marilyn Monroe in the most sort of scaled down version, which articulate some, either the whole unified culture or at least trying and hold up something that gives people some sense of who they are and what they're up to.

734
01:11:57,721 --> 01:11:59,160
That's another kind of God.

735
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:01,320
That's a Heidegger kind of God.

736
01:12:01,321 --> 01:12:05,080
And then there's the multiplicity of gods in the Odyssey.

737
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:07,800
And that's a whole big story of its own.

738
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,960
It's certainly not monotheism.

739
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:11,400
They aren't works of art.

740
01:12:11,401 --> 01:12:15,080
The Odyssey is a work of art, but Athena isn't a work of art.

741
01:12:15,401 --> 01:12:26,200
And so we have to understand next how this amazing Homeric conception of what a god is and what gods are.

742
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,760
And that's going to start next time.

743
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:37,160
And you read the first four books and you ask yourself, sort of, what is Athena up to as a goddess?

744
01:12:37,721 --> 01:12:41,400
And what is she doing to Telemachus?

745
01:12:41,721 --> 01:12:48,360
And why does she appear to Telemachus at this crucial moment in his life?

746
01:12:48,361 --> 01:12:52,681
Keep your eye on all that and read the first four books.

747
01:12:52,681 --> 01:13:09,080
And now, as for the Course, I won't be able to tell you until next time, those of you who are on the waiting list, whether I can take you or not, it all depends on either getting a bigger room or playing some kind of trick of some sort that will produce the same effect as having a bigger room.
