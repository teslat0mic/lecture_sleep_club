1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
We got up to Father Mapple, remember?

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,841
And we can't go back over.

3
00:00:05,841 --> 00:00:09,120
I'll go in the super fast review.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:19,760
We talked about lots of things, mainly the opposition between the land and the sea, and how the land was for what was solid and marked off, and the sea is indefinite.

5
00:00:19,761 --> 00:00:24,561
We talked about Balkington, who only can live at sea.

6
00:00:24,561 --> 00:00:27,120
He can't stand the slavish land.

7
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:32,641
He always immediately leaves on another boat.

8
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:36,880
And he stands in the howling gale of the infinite.

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:46,320
That is, he stands out in the unmarked nowhere and then apparently falls off the boat.

10
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:52,480
So Balkington is not a little, he's sort of heroic nihilism, but he's not a form of life.

11
00:00:52,481 --> 00:00:54,880
Uh-oh, there's too much wind now.

12
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:57,760
Yeah, why don't we close this one, David?

13
00:00:57,761 --> 00:00:58,240
It's easier.

14
00:00:58,241 --> 00:01:00,000
They're just a rock.

15
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:02,800
Yeah, ah, thanks.

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,800
Okay, so those are the two main things we've talked about.

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:26,840
Now, and we were ready to talk about Father Mapple as another version of how to deal with the uncertainty, indefiniteness, non-representableness of life and meaning.

18
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:34,280
And so we turn to him, which is on page 36 of this rare book.

19
00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:38,201
And I'll read you things carefully.

20
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:48,761
Okay, we're in chapter 8, page 36, a little below the middle of the page, about Mapple.

21
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:51,160
He's also a sea person.

22
00:01:51,161 --> 00:02:00,600
He had been a sailor and a harpooner in his youth for many years past, but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry.

23
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:28,280
So the interesting question is: is there a kind of way of having a land at sea, having something definite that gives meaning to your life, even though you're not on the land where the roles and the practices and the institutions and all that for giving meaning are, in effect, sort of boringly and slavishly and vainly settled?

24
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,080
Is there any third possibility?

25
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,720
Something definite and out in the indefinite.

26
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,841
And there is.

27
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,080
And he tells it as a story about Jonah.

28
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,001
On page 40, it starts.

29
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:57,400
The important thing about Jonah is, one, that he got swallowed up by a whale, so it's a natural thing to be talking about as these sailors are about to leave for a whale hunting voyage.

30
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,800
But the reason he got swallowed up is what's interesting.

31
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,680
On 40, Father Maple says, shipmates, and then he goes on.

32
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,561
I just start with shipmates because, again, I want to say he's a sea person.

33
00:03:12,561 --> 00:03:14,720
And Melville wants to make that clear.

34
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:22,321
But he says, about a third of the way down on page 40, we're in chapter 9.

35
00:03:22,641 --> 00:03:30,080
But what it is, see, but what is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches?

36
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:38,400
Shipmates, it is a two-strand lesson, a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living God.

37
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,600
We don't know yet what that means, but he says more.

38
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:52,801
As with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amate, that's Jonah, was in his willful disobedience of the command of God.

39
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,561
Never mind now what that command was or how conveyed, which he found a hard command.

40
00:03:59,121 --> 00:04:11,441
Already he's telling you that God had a vocation for Jonah, a job, a plan of what the point of Jonah's life was.

41
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:15,601
And he says, don't worry about how Jonah found out what his calling was.

42
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:22,881
Don't even matter what his calling was, that he had a calling and that it was hard is all that we need to know.

43
00:04:22,881 --> 00:04:28,641
And he says, God oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade.

44
00:04:28,641 --> 00:04:31,921
And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves.

45
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,120
And it is in this disobeying ourselves wherein the hardness of obeying God consists.

46
00:04:37,121 --> 00:04:46,521
That means that your vocation is not going to fit easily with the rest of your life, with your fan having a family, for instance.

47
00:04:46,681 --> 00:04:53,400
Jesus says every once in a while, I don't have any mothers and brothers and sisters when they come and say, What about your family?

48
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,960
Because he's on his mission.

49
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:03,480
In general, your vocation is going to require you to give up some of the things you desire.

50
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:06,280
It doesn't matter what you want.

51
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,960
This is what you need.

52
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:14,840
You need to do what this command says you need to do.

53
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,641
Think of Ferrara, we have all sorts of examples.

54
00:05:17,641 --> 00:05:33,480
Think of Gandhi or Martin Luther King, the kind of people who have a command and are willing to sacrifice everything that they might like, including finally their lives, to do it.

55
00:05:33,481 --> 00:05:39,641
That's the kind of person, an issue, that Jonah raises.

56
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:43,400
So now we have to see what Father Mapple makes of that.

57
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,801
So it looks like every person is called to some vocation.

58
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:56,840
And it looks like already we're getting an extreme Protestant kind of religion.

59
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:18,520
It looked utterly different than Dante losing his identity and getting swept up in the will that moves the sun and the other stars and losing his commitment to politics in Florence and Beatrice, all in the light of this absolutely satisfying, completely impersonal supreme being.

60
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,160
That's the extreme version of the Catholic view.

61
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:32,561
The Protestant view, which I mention every once in a while, reaches its extreme in Kierkegaard, is that each person has their own unique vocation.

62
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:36,400
It starts, I presume, with Luther saying that every man is a Pope.

63
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:43,121
You don't need any intermediate things, any intermediate people or between you and God.

64
00:06:43,121 --> 00:06:54,881
God has a particular plan for you, and you can only be an individual and have an identity if you take on that command.

65
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,201
That's what it is.

66
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,881
And Kierkegaard calls that subjective truth.

67
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:11,360
That means it isn't an objective fact, for instance, that Beatrice is adorable and worth sacrificing your life.

68
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,641
What is happening?

69
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:15,201
Osabundo is gone icy.

70
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,280
Well, how are we going to deal with that?

71
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,201
Well, maybe we can't.

72
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,761
I know one way we can deal with it.

73
00:07:21,761 --> 00:07:23,840
We have to close the door.

74
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,720
Sorry.

75
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,521
Thanks, Dad.

76
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:28,240
That's all kinds of adventures.

77
00:07:28,241 --> 00:07:40,400
So there's no objective truth that Martin Luther King should give his life for equality for African Americans.

78
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,520
There's no reason why the knight should die for his lady.

79
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,280
It's a subjective truth.

80
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,081
That is, it's true insofar as you totally commit yourself to it.

81
00:07:52,081 --> 00:07:57,601
Beatrice being adorable and savior totally depends on Dante's commitment.

82
00:07:57,601 --> 00:08:05,761
If Dante wasn't committed to Beatrice being adorable, she wouldn't be his Savior, and she wouldn't be adorable.

83
00:08:05,761 --> 00:08:12,201
And it's that kind of subjective truth that Mapple is on to.

84
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,081
On 47, I read more.

85
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:16,601
This is all in the same chapter.

86
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,001
He says, Jonah did the Almighty's bidding.

87
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,680
And what was that, shipmates?

88
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,080
To preach the truth in the face of falsehood.

89
00:08:25,081 --> 00:08:26,361
That was it.

90
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,321
I don't find that, that's not what I wanted to read.

91
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,160
That does not cast any light on my, doesn't disagree with me.

92
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,761
That's just his vocation.

93
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,961
So here he is on the top of 47.

94
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:51,001
Delight is to him a far, far upward and inward delight, who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth ever stands forth his own inexorable self.

95
00:08:51,641 --> 00:09:02,681
That is, who has his own identity, who does his own thing, whether it be romantic love or some cause, or you could do it even by dedicating your life to science.

96
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:14,761
But it has to be, science is a little funny because it has to be something that has the quality it has only as long as and because you have totally devoted your life to it.

97
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:15,320
I don't know.

98
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,360
I think science can't be a subjective truth now that I think about it.

99
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:19,721
It's a funny one.

100
00:09:19,721 --> 00:09:24,200
You can certainly devote your life to it, but it doesn't depend on your devoting your life to it.

101
00:09:24,761 --> 00:09:26,441
Science doesn't care.

102
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:29,081
That's an interesting problem to think about.

103
00:09:29,081 --> 00:09:40,520
Kierkegaard certainly thinks that science is done from a disinterested point of view, and that this kind of commitment is the ultimately personal, interested point of view.

104
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,601
So don't think about science in there.

105
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,081
So, what's happening there in Mapple?

106
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:52,841
He says, One more, I'll read you one more.

107
00:09:52,841 --> 00:10:02,481
Delight to him who gives no quarter in the truth and kills, burns, and destroys all sin, though he pluck it out from under the robes of senators and judges.

108
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:11,441
Delight, top gallant delight to him who acknowledges no law or Lord, but the Lord is God and is only a patriot to heaven.

109
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:19,681
And no law, and his God doesn't give you any ethical principles, any universal principles.

110
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:26,161
This God just tells you what you have to be committed to.

111
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:39,121
And since it's subjective, and since it has, in Schiffegaard's language, no objective validity, it makes no sense to go around proselytizing, proselytizing for it.

112
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,281
Sort of getting everybody to adore Beatrice wouldn't make much sense.

113
00:10:43,280 --> 00:11:11,600
In fact, it would show, Kierkegaard talks about how Don Quixote tries to get everybody to admit that Dulcinea, this peasant girl that Don Quixote in his craziness has taken to be his lady, is the, and she just a normal, plain old peasant girl, but he wants them to swear that she is the most beautiful and lovable lady in the world because he won't, it won't, it won't be true unless he gets it sort of objectively accepted.

114
00:11:11,601 --> 00:11:13,841
That's the wrong way to think about it.

115
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:18,801
That she'll be adorable if he adores her, and that's all you need.

116
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:27,841
But that's also very unsettling because that means there's no foundation for this commitment.

117
00:11:27,841 --> 00:11:30,161
You just get this calling.

118
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,081
It's an experience.

119
00:11:32,081 --> 00:11:40,720
It's sort of, I guess, like a mood, a god calling you, except whereas the moods of the gods come and go.

120
00:11:40,721 --> 00:11:49,481
Aphrodite shrines on Helen for a while, and then she stops shining on Helen, and then Helen gets bored, but with Paris.

121
00:11:49,721 --> 00:12:02,761
But this is once in a lifetime for your whole life and with your whole life kind of commitment, with nothing to back it up, but that you have the experience that it's your commitment.

122
00:12:02,761 --> 00:12:16,121
Kierkegaard calls that starting to emphasize the ungroundedness of it, that it's like swimming over 40,000 fathoms, which is interesting because there it is.

123
00:12:16,121 --> 00:12:33,321
Even Kierkegaard, who has necessarily not read Moby Dick, which was written the same year as Karen Trembling, the book of his that everybody reads, Kierkegaard also has this ocean picture of this bottomlessness of this kind of commitment.

124
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:39,241
And the question only left is, I mean, and there is Melville inventing in a way.

125
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:44,121
I'm putting a lot more into it than he actually says, but it's in here.

126
00:12:44,121 --> 00:13:00,681
He's inventing a Protestant Kierkegaardian, not the infallible Presbyterian church, which is for every which tries to be true for everybody, a special individual truth, and the riskiness of it is all in there.

127
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,721
And the question is, Ishmael can invent it.

128
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:08,121
What does Ishmael think about it?

129
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:12,440
What does Melville is Melville a Kierkegaardian?

130
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:27,241
Is this the answer to the problem of how to get meaning and keep the indefiniteness of the sea and not the slavish banality, everybody doing the same thing, following some job or other and so forth, which is the land?

131
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:28,881
Well, it is an answer.

132
00:13:28,881 --> 00:13:33,361
It's an interesting Kierkegaardian answer, but it's not Melville's answer.

133
00:13:33,361 --> 00:13:37,520
And he gives you his judgment on it in a funny way.

134
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,161
Right, the next chapter 10 begins.

135
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,641
Returning to the Spouter Inn from the chapel, I found Queque there quite alone.

136
00:13:44,641 --> 00:13:48,081
He had left the chapel before the benediction sometime.

137
00:13:48,081 --> 00:14:02,961
In other words, Quequeg, who is in a certain way Melville's hero of strange other sense of religiousness and the sacred, Quequeg's walked out on Father Mappel.

138
00:14:02,961 --> 00:14:07,520
And Ishmael sat through it, but he doesn't seem to be affected by it.

139
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,721
It's just not Melville's answer.

140
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,361
Remember, I mean, it's no secret.

141
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,721
I wouldn't be teaching this book at the end of the course.

142
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:23,361
I'd love to teach the book at the end of any course because it's the greatest book ever, greatest American novel anyway.

143
00:14:23,361 --> 00:14:28,160
But it goes in this course because Melville is a polytheist.

144
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,681
It just isn't clear yet.

145
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:38,801
But if you were a polytheist, you would walk out of such a thing that said, well, there's one God and He has one mission for you.

146
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,881
And it's sort of multiple monotheism.

147
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:50,721
That, I mean, it covers your whole world for your whole life and tells you what's meaningful and what's not.

148
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:53,520
You don't go around trying to convert other people to it.

149
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,441
And you don't go around, but you don't go around either questioning it.

150
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,040
It gives you a world.

151
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,081
It gives you one unified, lasting world to find your vocation.

152
00:15:04,081 --> 00:15:07,681
And that's not open enough.

153
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,440
And that's a Melville.

154
00:15:11,761 --> 00:15:17,961
You miss a lot of religions and a lot of sacred if you're going to get a Kierkegaardian vocation.

155
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,241
I think it's pretty impressive.

156
00:15:21,241 --> 00:15:24,361
And when I teach Kierkegaard, I fight for it altogether.

157
00:15:24,361 --> 00:15:26,121
But it's not in this book.

158
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,960
It just comes and goes like Balkington's heroic nihilism comes and goes.

159
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:38,681
Melville is good at making up exactly the kind of things that people will understand, say, roughly 50 years later.

160
00:15:39,881 --> 00:15:48,680
Well, yeah, Nietzschean things like Balkington, or things that are exactly contemporary, like Kierkegaardian things going on in Denmark.

161
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,321
But Melville makes them up, and he doesn't accept them.

162
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,761
So where are we?

163
00:15:54,761 --> 00:16:08,761
Well, Ishmael wants something that allows him to take seriously Quequeg's religion, Yo-Yo 2, and any other religion, as you'll see in the book that he visits.

164
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:18,920
He thinks that Christianity is too narrow, and it's irrelevant to his problem.

165
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:22,521
And Yo-Yo knows it's irrelevant.

166
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:31,240
On 84, which is the end of chapter 17, there's this strange thing where it turns out, did I say Yo-Yo?

167
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:37,881
I mean Kwequeg knows what, that there's, Quequeg's a funny figure.

168
00:16:37,881 --> 00:16:44,361
Quique is, as you'll have, strictly in his religion.

169
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:49,720
I mean, he worships Yo-Yo, and that's his God, and he does the holidays for that God.

170
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,641
And he's not interested in converting anybody to that.

171
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,760
And that's good from Melville's point of view.

172
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:04,240
But he's also not interested in anybody else's religion or their sense of the sacred and how he might get in tune with that.

173
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:15,361
And in a way, Quiqueg is like Jews, like Hebrews, who don't, Jews now, who don't want to are not interested in converting anybody to their religion.

174
00:17:15,361 --> 00:17:22,080
It's their particular relation to God and their particular tradition.

175
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:28,400
And Melville likes that, but it's still too confining for him.

176
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,280
Here's the discussion of it on 84.

177
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:41,121
He was talking to Quiqueg about his Ramadan, and he was fasting so much, and he was telling him he didn't have to do that.

178
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:54,000
And then he says, I don't think that my remarks about religion made much impression on Queque, because in the first place, he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered from his own point of view.

179
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:57,280
That is, he's not interested in other religions.

180
00:17:57,281 --> 00:18:03,920
And in the second place, he did not more than one-third understand me, couch my ideas as simply as I would.

181
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:11,680
And finally, he no longer thought he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than I did.

182
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,600
I don't understand that exactly about the true religion.

183
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:24,480
I mean, it's true that it's the right religion for Queque, but he does have an openness to other religions.

184
00:18:25,121 --> 00:18:37,281
Not that he wants to change his religion for them, but even unlike, I guess, the Jews, Cuiqueg, is ready to learn from other religions.

185
00:18:37,281 --> 00:18:38,400
I'll read you that in a minute.

186
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,000
But he does stick to his religion.

187
00:18:40,001 --> 00:18:41,681
He understands that's the true religion.

188
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,441
He looked at me with a sort of, but not of true religion, you know, to go out and proselytize.

189
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,480
That's the important thing.

190
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,081
Not of true religion because it's true, everybody ought to believe it.

191
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:53,960
It's true for him and his people.

192
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:09,240
He looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety, which is a funny mouthful of words here.

193
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,920
But evangelical, not in the sense of going out and converting.

194
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,081
So I don't know why that evangelical.

195
00:19:15,081 --> 00:19:17,160
What does evangelical mean, David?

196
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:18,200
Ah, you think so?

197
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:18,920
Let's try that.

198
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,081
That's good, because I never understood this sentence.

199
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:22,281
Let's try it that way.

200
00:19:22,281 --> 00:19:26,121
A sensible young man should be hopelessly lost.

201
00:19:26,361 --> 00:19:35,000
I see, not lost because he has fallen into evangelical pagan from his point of view.

202
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,681
Ishmael, you like that.

203
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,601
You seem sure about that.

204
00:19:38,601 --> 00:19:42,040
I see, well, I hope that's right, that that better be right.

205
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,841
But I never thought of it that way.

206
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,480
So he's lost to it.

207
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,720
I see it too as a kind of pun.

208
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,760
I read this as he doesn't get it.

209
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:59,000
But then that would mean he doesn't get Quequeg's religion.

210
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,601
And Kwequeg wouldn't refer to his religion as evangelical pagan piety.

211
00:20:04,601 --> 00:20:09,641
So he must be lost to it in the sense that he's fallen into it.

212
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:10,761
That's the sense of loss.

213
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:17,160
I mean, see, there are two ways of being lost to something: being oblivious of it and being taken in by it.

214
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,281
And the question is, what's Quequeg thinking?

215
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:31,281
He's thinking that Ishmael has been taken in by what, from Quequeg's point of view, is evangelical pagan piety.

216
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,480
That's your view.

217
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,281
I like that.

218
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:34,480
You're Protestant.

219
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:37,440
Does that mean that it's out to convert people?

220
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,920
Is that a necessary part of evangelism?

221
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,361
That's what I thought.

222
00:20:41,361 --> 00:20:46,961
If you don't think it was the how about 1850 when this I'm not convinced, by the way, you're reading.

223
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:57,920
The more I think about it, the more I think that the idea that Quequeg understands enough to understand.

224
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,361
Wait, I'm stumped.

225
00:20:59,361 --> 00:20:59,840
Let's have.

226
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yes, somebody has a helpful suggestion?

227
00:21:02,081 --> 00:21:06,240
He's very thinking Ishmael is conversion.

228
00:21:06,321 --> 00:21:13,200
Not why you're hoping that he's not meeting with apostles, but is that it?

229
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:22,561
That a sensible young man, that is an Ishmael, should be lost to evangelical pagan piety.

230
00:21:22,561 --> 00:21:23,841
Let me just think.

231
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,400
What is evangelical?

232
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:28,400
Quiqueg is thinking it.

233
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:36,960
So it doesn't mean, according to David, that he's deaf to Quequeg's religion.

234
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,960
That would be the wrong way to read it.

235
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,641
That's what Quequeg is saying.

236
00:21:40,641 --> 00:21:42,321
He's calling Ishmael a pagan.

237
00:21:42,321 --> 00:21:44,561
That's about what I've read about pages.

238
00:21:44,881 --> 00:21:46,320
Okay, I'm going to try it once more.

239
00:21:46,561 --> 00:21:48,001
I want it to come out that way.

240
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,881
It just feels, doesn't work very well for me.

241
00:21:50,881 --> 00:22:06,480
He looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion as though he thought it a great pity that a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety.

242
00:22:07,521 --> 00:22:14,520
So it had been so taken in by Christianity, is how you read it, which is evangelical pagan piety.

243
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:19,160
So, well, everybody should come and tell me in office hours what you think.

244
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:32,601
Taken, I mean, I'm writing down David's version, taken in by Christianity, i.e., evangelical pagan piety.

245
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,361
Okay, I don't know.

246
00:22:34,361 --> 00:22:38,920
But I, I mean, if that isn't, if that isn't the right reading, I don't know what is.

247
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:51,400
That's because then the only alternative would be that Kleeque refers to himself as, well, there's a third possibility, which is how I've always read it.

248
00:22:51,400 --> 00:23:01,720
Kleequeg feet Ishmael has lost to, no, I don't know.

249
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,680
I stop.

250
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,601
I think I like your way.

251
00:23:04,601 --> 00:23:08,520
I'm going to stick to your way until I, if I can.

252
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,641
I haven't got out.

253
00:23:09,641 --> 00:23:11,480
I mean, that's the best way to read it.

254
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,280
Okay.

255
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,800
Unless anybody else has another opinion, I'm going to go on.

256
00:23:18,121 --> 00:23:22,041
So it looks like Kleeque doesn't buy it.

257
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:23,560
That's the important thing.

258
00:23:23,561 --> 00:23:28,440
And that, remember, I said it's interesting that he's open to other religions.

259
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,841
Openness to the sacred.

260
00:23:30,841 --> 00:23:37,480
I mean, I just give you all the guidelines I can in this very, very deep and difficult book.

261
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:55,080
Ishmael is just totally open to every possible form of religion, every possible form of the sacred, unless it's closed, as Presbyterian is, and philosophy is, according to him.

262
00:23:55,321 --> 00:23:57,400
But he's for total openness.

263
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,080
And it goes with his, and keep your eyes open for this, total moodiness.

264
00:24:02,081 --> 00:24:13,841
He's capable of getting in tune with all sorts of religions, and he's certainly capable of getting in all sorts of moods, totally contradictory moods, and he knows it, and he's proud of it.

265
00:24:13,841 --> 00:24:29,680
And that's so that, and so Queque had better not be limited to totally ignoring all other religions because he thinks his is the right one for him and his people.

266
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,280
And he doesn't.

267
00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:42,881
He isn't, because on 84 you find out that, and I think it's 84, that Kweekweg has tried to get something out of Christianity.

268
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:46,641
Now, that's what I was reading, is on 84, so I've got to go on.

269
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,240
Where is it?

270
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,361
55.

271
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,041
55, which is the end of chapter 12.

272
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:58,000
No, 54, near the end of chapter 12.

273
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:12,641
At bottom, so Kwequeg told me, he was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians the arts whereby to make his people happier than they were, and more than that, better than they were.

274
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:24,641
But alas, the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both miserable and wicked, infinitely more so than all his father's heathens.

275
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:31,121
And so he tries to cross-appropriate, to use that term.

276
00:25:31,121 --> 00:25:38,240
Remember from the Odyssey where Hermes takes the drugs from Circe and gives them to Odysseus to use against her.

277
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:50,200
So he's trying to pick up something interesting from the practices of Christianity that he can use in his tradition and in his religion, but he can't find anything because it's Christianity.

278
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,361
But he's open to other possible religions.

279
00:25:54,361 --> 00:26:17,480
That makes him not an evangelical person, where the evangelical person, as I'm understanding it, and I don't know, we don't know when it became that way, but it means now that you believe there's one true religion, and for everybody's own good, you're going to convert them to that one.

280
00:26:19,321 --> 00:26:22,280
And Kuique certainly doesn't have that view.

281
00:26:22,601 --> 00:26:31,320
Okay, so Quiqued's interesting, and he's the nearest one to Ishmael's own kind of relation to religion.

282
00:26:31,561 --> 00:26:37,960
Let me go through some of the other, I mean, the alternatives that we've talked about to sort of sum them up.

283
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:46,920
I say in my notes, but I wonder now after what I've been saying and what I've been hearing, that whether this is right.

284
00:26:46,920 --> 00:27:01,240
I say here, I think Quiqued represents a kind of pagan, non-onto-theological kind of monotheism, sort of like Aeschylus, where there are these gods, these various forces.

285
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,800
But I don't even, I don't see any evidence for that.

286
00:27:03,801 --> 00:27:04,681
Scratch that.

287
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:18,680
I think that there's, I mean, why in Edism is if he sees that there are two religious forces and sees that they are both important and have to be taken account of, and all the things that Aeschylus does.

288
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,800
No, I think he's not doing that.

289
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:39,121
I think he's just, as I say, just open to other religions, but not open to sharing them, just open to seeing if he can learn anything from them.

290
00:27:39,121 --> 00:27:46,641
He wants the religion that's right for him and his people, and he'll leave another religion right for other people and their traditions.

291
00:27:46,641 --> 00:27:53,121
And he thinks that's Ishmael thinks that's good, but not his way.

292
00:27:53,281 --> 00:27:58,240
I wrote here: Kwequeg believes in idols, but they are really gods for him.

293
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,641
But he doesn't go out and seek converts.

294
00:28:00,641 --> 00:28:03,040
It isn't gods for everybody.

295
00:28:04,321 --> 00:28:10,480
And that Ishmael is ready to worship Kwequeg's God isn't Ishmael's idea.

296
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,400
Remember, it's Kwequeg's idea.

297
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,321
Ishmael joins him, volunteers to join him.

298
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:16,881
Yeah.

299
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,960
Wait a second.

300
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,800
Boy, when the microphone is on, it's great to call.

301
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:23,361
Go ahead.

302
00:28:23,841 --> 00:28:26,480
Believe it or not, I can't hear you from back here.

303
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,000
I'll come and hear you up here.

304
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,800
Go ahead.

305
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,361
Do you still, do you believe that Kwequeg still wants to learn from other religions?

306
00:28:33,361 --> 00:28:36,560
Or do you think that he's kind of given up athletic experience with Christianity?

307
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:37,361
Right.

308
00:28:37,521 --> 00:28:38,480
You know, a good question.

309
00:28:39,281 --> 00:28:44,720
Do I think that Kwequeg wants to learn from other religions, or do you think he's given up?

310
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,680
Well, I think he's given up on Christianity.

311
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:56,721
But I don't think that means that he would give up on the weird religion that worships the whale skeleton that later comes in.

312
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,681
He doesn't go there.

313
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:08,641
I mean, so we don't see Quequeg visiting any other religions, but I don't see any evidence that he's given up hopes of that somewhere he could learn something that could help his people.

314
00:29:08,641 --> 00:29:19,641
But he certainly thinks that from a kind of religion that claims to be the truth for everybody, he doesn't think he's going to learn anything from that religion.

315
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,441
You don't see much.

316
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:28,920
Remember, I said one of the odd features of the book is Queque plays such a big role before they get on the boat.

317
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,121
All of this is before they've gotten on the Pequot.

318
00:29:32,121 --> 00:29:42,680
Once they set out in search of the whale, there's only a few scenes, crucial ones, but very few where Quequeg ever shows up again.

319
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:54,121
And that's odd, but that's, I think, sort of psychologically interesting, but I don't think it's got any important philosophical significance.

320
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,881
Okay, now I want to go back to something else and rather different.

321
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:15,480
This question of attitudes toward religion, just to remember, whether they are like Baltington, like Maple, like Queque, or like Christians, that's an interesting issue, and it runs through the whole book.

322
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:23,720
But there's a more interesting issue for sure, and that is the whale and the sea in their boundlessness.

323
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:33,641
That special non-representableness, which Melville holds is the sort of deeper truth about reality.

324
00:30:33,641 --> 00:30:36,280
You can only see it in the dark.

325
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:43,160
But if you see it, I haven't proved this yet in the book, but you'll see as we go.

326
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:51,160
I mean, if you have a sense of that, then you're open to all moods and the sacred.

327
00:30:51,881 --> 00:30:57,760
It's losing track of the ocean, of the non-representable and the bottomless and so.

328
00:30:57,561 --> 00:31:03,521
It narrows your openness to reality.

329
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,320
But the whale, now, so we got the boundless sea.

330
00:31:08,321 --> 00:31:12,320
And remember, and all of this, you look puzzled, and you rightly look puzzled.

331
00:31:14,321 --> 00:31:17,361
I'm giving you sort of the same experience you'd have if you read the book.

332
00:31:17,361 --> 00:31:18,720
You don't know why.

333
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:26,240
For instance, when I was reviewing what we said last time, I knew I forgot something important, namely the picture of the whale.

334
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,881
So we're going back to the picture of the whale, which you couldn't figure out what it was.

335
00:31:30,881 --> 00:31:41,201
It was all dark and all mysterious, and it solicited all kinds of interpretations, and it was enough to make a nerve, drive a nervous man crazy.

336
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:48,400
That is, if you really wanted clarity and ambiguity, this picture would not be one you'd want to be having in your living room.

337
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,801
And in the end, Melville never says that it's a picture of a whale.

338
00:31:52,801 --> 00:31:55,121
He just says that's finally his theory.

339
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,641
That's the theory that worked best.

340
00:31:56,641 --> 00:32:05,680
He'll always tell you his views as interpretations, because he thinks all you've ever got are interpretations.

341
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,201
That's exactly the thesis that Nietzsche.

342
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,960
But Melville already has it.

343
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:21,760
But anyway, his interpretation of the picture was that it was a picture of the whale in its non-picturableness.

344
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,560
That's what he tells you when he tells you this fascinating story.

345
00:32:26,561 --> 00:32:28,881
And now I'm going to follow that up.

346
00:32:28,881 --> 00:32:42,320
But I want to remind you from last time on page Roman numeral 35, right at the beginning, the extracts, of the connection between the whale as unrepresentable and the sea as unrepresentable.

347
00:32:42,521 --> 00:32:45,400
We haven't argued the whale is unrepresentable at all.

348
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,561
All we've argued so far is the sea.

349
00:32:47,561 --> 00:32:49,960
So here, but we've got this verse to go on.

350
00:32:50,281 --> 00:32:59,000
Oh, the rare old whale amid storm and gale in his ocean home will be a giant in might where might is right and king of the boundless sea.

351
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:16,760
So now the question is: is he, the whale, it, also unrepresentable and open to lots of interpretations, none of which ever seem settled and which don't add up to any one.

352
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,480
Well, that's what I'm going to talk about for a while.

353
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,720
And I'm going to jump all over the book because I just have to do it.

354
00:33:25,001 --> 00:33:28,761
It doesn't affect where you are when you're reading it and the plot.

355
00:33:29,081 --> 00:33:30,520
So we go on.

356
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:38,921
The whale, it turns out, can't be pictured or described at all.

357
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:54,121
So the whale is the sort of paradigm, the representation, the, I would say, personification if it was a person, the mammothation of the unbounded.

358
00:33:54,121 --> 00:33:55,560
So let's look at that.

359
00:33:55,561 --> 00:34:14,281
On 297, way back in chapter 68, about five, six paragraphs in, towards the bottom of 297, he says, in life, the visible surface of the sperm whale, it's only the sperm whale all the time when he says the whale.

360
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,601
The sperm whale is not the least among the many marvels he presents.

361
00:34:18,601 --> 00:34:30,160
Almost invariably, it is all over, obliquely crossed and recrossed with numberless straight marks in thick arrays, something like those in the finest Italian line engravings.

362
00:34:27,481 --> 00:34:33,520
Then, skipping a little, these are hieroglyphical.

363
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:42,801
That is, if you call those mysterious ciphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to use in the present connection.

364
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:59,441
By my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one sperm whale in particular, I was much struck with a plate representing the old Indian characters chiseled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the upper Mississippi.

365
00:34:59,441 --> 00:35:06,081
Like those mystic rocks, too, the mystic marked whale remains undecipherable.

366
00:35:06,081 --> 00:35:07,520
That's going to be the theme.

367
00:35:07,521 --> 00:35:18,000
It's going to almost be boring if it weren't that he has endless interesting, sort of crazy varieties of the indecipherable.

368
00:35:18,001 --> 00:35:22,081
So we go from that indecipherable to the tail of the whale.

369
00:35:22,081 --> 00:35:26,321
Believe it or not, the tail of the whale isn't even guess how that could be.

370
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:37,441
On page 366, the end of chapter 86, you hear: The more I consider this mighty tale, the more I do deplore my inability to express it.

371
00:35:37,441 --> 00:35:45,121
At times, there are gestures in it, which, though they would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly inexplicable.

372
00:35:45,121 --> 00:35:53,921
Nor are there wanting other motions of the whale in his general body, full of strangeness and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant.

373
00:35:53,921 --> 00:35:58,081
Direct him now, oh, sorry, dissect him now as I may.

374
00:35:58,081 --> 00:36:00,561
I may but go skin deep.

375
00:36:00,561 --> 00:36:02,880
I know him not and never will.

376
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,561
But if I know not even the tail of this whale, how understand his head?

377
00:36:08,561 --> 00:36:13,960
Much more, how comprehend his face, when face he has none.

378
00:36:12,481 --> 00:36:17,800
And now we need a little bit of background before I read the rest of this.

379
00:36:18,601 --> 00:36:35,961
Melville is about to make a funny move with a famous part of Exodus 33 of the Hebrew Bible, where I quote from the Bible now: Moses said, I pray thee, show me thy glory.

380
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:41,160
But God said, Thou cannot see my face, for man shall not see me and live.

381
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:46,521
And the Lord said, Behold, I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by.

382
00:36:46,521 --> 00:36:52,281
And then I will take away my hand, and you will see my back, that my face shall not be seen.

383
00:36:52,601 --> 00:36:56,840
And now he says, Melville, that the whale seems to have no face.

384
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:04,361
And he seems to say, Thou shalt see my back parts, my tail, he seems to say, that my face shall not be seen.

385
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:08,841
And Melville goes on, but I cannot completely make out his back parts.

386
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:14,041
And hint what he will about his face, I say again, he has no face.

387
00:37:15,561 --> 00:37:18,761
So there you get the same story again.

388
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:25,160
And on 258, something else, some other version.

389
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,360
What is that?

390
00:37:27,001 --> 00:37:28,760
Nothing is on 258.

391
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,921
No, that's because I'm on 350.

392
00:37:31,561 --> 00:37:33,081
Here we are.

393
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,280
Okay, another, what are we getting?

394
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:49,960
We're getting, remember, that there's a dimension of reality which is in this book represented by or symbolized, neither of those are good words, which you don't want to say represented because it's unrepresentable.

395
00:37:49,961 --> 00:37:51,240
You don't want to say symbolized.

396
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:56,121
Melville doesn't like symbols for reasons I'll talk about sometime.

397
00:37:57,521 --> 00:38:10,081
There are aspects of reality which in this book, reality shows forth in the sea, in the ocean, and in the whale.

398
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:21,840
And he's talking about that aspect, namely the deepest truth about reality, that it can't be symbolized, described, understood, deciphered, and represented.

399
00:38:21,921 --> 00:38:24,160
I'm just telling you so we don't get lost.

400
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:38,800
On 258, chapter 56, that is, he says, the living whale in his full majesty and significance is only to be seen at sea and in unfathomable waters and floats the vast bulk of him out of sight.

401
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,001
This is 258, about a third of the way down.

402
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,641
Like a launched line of battleship.

403
00:38:46,641 --> 00:38:50,241
And out of that element, it is this thing.

404
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,360
And out of that element, we're talking about the whale.

405
00:38:53,360 --> 00:39:03,441
It is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to host him bodily into the air so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations.

406
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:06,881
That is, if he's in the water, you can't see him very clearly.

407
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:20,721
And if you hoist it out of the water, it just goes sort of droopy and globby and doesn't give you the shape the whale has when all those tons of whale meat are organized and floating around.

408
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,281
So that's another one of those.

409
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:45,561
So the sort of joke is, in a way, or a joke, is when you go back to the painting and the spouter in, and you say the painting is a mysterious blur, and then you say, well, my theory is it's a sperm whale, as if somehow now you've explained anything.

410
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:51,401
But when you study the sperm whale, it turns out the sperm whale is intrinsically a kind of blur.

411
00:39:51,401 --> 00:40:01,080
There's no way to get clear about how it looks, how it looks when it comes out of the water, how it looks when you look at its face, and so because it hasn't any.

412
00:40:01,081 --> 00:40:05,961
So Melville comes to the conclusion, and this is on top of 259.

413
00:40:05,961 --> 00:40:17,481
For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last.

414
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:19,561
So the painting didn't succeed.

415
00:40:19,561 --> 00:40:29,721
The one portrait, true, one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness.

416
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:35,241
So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like.

417
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,641
That's crucial for him.

418
00:40:37,641 --> 00:40:39,960
I never noticed that it's unpainted.

419
00:40:39,961 --> 00:40:49,401
That sort of nicely contradicts the non-painting of the non-understandable whale from the beginning.

420
00:40:49,401 --> 00:40:50,120
Okay.

421
00:40:50,441 --> 00:40:54,840
And another way to put it is: there's no way the whale actually looks.

422
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,241
He is, quote, as indefinite.

423
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,801
So he is as indefinite as God.

424
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:08,280
We give her that phrase back from Balkington might be one way of summing it.

425
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,040
Of course, not that there is any God.

426
00:41:10,041 --> 00:41:11,400
God is the indefinite.

427
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,361
Yeah.

428
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,481
Yeah.

429
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,680
Huh?

430
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,840
It's a book that's the classifying whale classification.

431
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,440
Gee, that's a good one.

432
00:41:20,441 --> 00:41:21,641
I don't see it yet.

433
00:41:21,641 --> 00:41:26,761
On page 125, second paragraph.

434
00:41:27,081 --> 00:41:27,600
Yeah?

435
00:41:27,601 --> 00:41:29,840
It said to cla aha.

436
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,441
Yes, to classify of the conditions of chaos.

437
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:34,800
Okay, that's good.

438
00:41:34,961 --> 00:41:36,961
Yes, I have to add that to my list.

439
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:41,281
Page 125, whale as chaos.

440
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:50,481
And another thing that comes out of the satology is that, of course, science can't understand and explain the whale either.

441
00:41:50,481 --> 00:41:56,081
And Moby Dick is and Ishmael is clear about that.

442
00:41:56,561 --> 00:41:59,441
In fact, I thought it was in what I was going to read.

443
00:41:59,441 --> 00:42:00,720
And I haven't read it.

444
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,920
I wonder what happened to it.

445
00:42:01,921 --> 00:42:03,121
Just a second.

446
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:15,121
He's sure that science can really capture it because he thinks science really can't capture anything in its completeness, but particularly not the whale.

447
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,840
Wonder where he is.

448
00:42:18,001 --> 00:42:20,801
Might be back in those opening extracts.

449
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,441
Let's see, does he tell us anything about them?

450
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:24,081
Not really.

451
00:42:24,081 --> 00:42:28,160
They're just promiscuously gathered things.

452
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:31,761
Well, keep your eye open as you read it, and I will too.

453
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:47,680
I know he thinks that science can't, and of course, if we can't grasp the whale and it doesn't have a face and you can't get it out of the water and you can't understand its tail and all that, science isn't going to be able to fit it neatly into any categories according to him.

454
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,601
So I want to see if anybody finds it, let me know.

455
00:42:51,601 --> 00:42:55,680
I think I must have just skipped it when I was writing these notes.

456
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,481
Okay.

457
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:11,281
So, and because it's indefinite, and this is very important, the whale keeps open the possibility, in fact, it's really the necessity of endless interpretation.

458
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:21,001
If you could get the ultimate reality nailed down, then that would be the end of interpretation.

459
00:43:21,001 --> 00:43:33,720
But if reality in the ocean, in the whale, which is the personification of the ocean, the paradigm of the ocean, can't be described, then that keeps interpretation on.

460
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:39,561
It makes interpretation something that's going to have to happen all the time, and it's all that can happen.

461
00:43:39,561 --> 00:43:49,160
There's a chapter about interpretation where Melville says it in so many words that everyone has their own perspective on reality.

462
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,801
It's their interpretation.

463
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,521
And all there are is interpretations.

464
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,680
But he hasn't said it yet.

465
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:01,721
But I'm sure you'll recognize it when you get there.

466
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,280
Okay.

467
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:11,401
All attempts to, even scientific drawings are all wrong, I write here, but I don't give any page reference.

468
00:44:11,401 --> 00:44:14,360
That must be, that's bizarre.

469
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,800
Let's try 501.

470
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,841
There's a page reference running around loose.

471
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,920
I don't think that's it.

472
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,680
Not at all, not at all.

473
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:27,721
So I've got a claim that I haven't backed up.

474
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:32,440
But it's even scientific.

475
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:37,241
I mean, he says in so many words that scientific drawings are all wrong.

476
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:45,241
Because whenever you hoist the whale enough far out of the water to be able to draw it, you already have lost its true shape.

477
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:45,881
Okay.

478
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:53,320
And Ishmael finds all that sublime, but you can't you can't portray it.

479
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:59,200
Sublime, remember, means it's beyond any understanding and representation.

480
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,961
Here's another one, but it isn't the one that we're looking for.

481
00:44:57,561 --> 00:45:04,080
438.

482
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:21,361
How vain and foolish then, thought I, for timid untraveled man to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale by merely pouring over his dead attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood.

483
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:34,961
No, only in the heart of the quickest perils, only when within the eddying of his angry flukes, only on the profound, unbounded sea, can a fully invested whale be truly livingly found out.

484
00:45:34,961 --> 00:45:36,400
Well, that doesn't surprise us.

485
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:38,081
It isn't the science quote.

486
00:45:38,081 --> 00:45:40,080
It's just the general quote again.

487
00:45:40,401 --> 00:45:51,200
Insofar as you can get any understanding of the whale at all, that says, you can't do it by objectively standing back and detachedly looking at the whale.

488
00:45:51,200 --> 00:46:06,641
By being totally involved in a sort of life and death struggle with the whale, you come to understand about as much of what this indefinite chaotic power is as you can understand.

489
00:46:06,961 --> 00:46:07,760
Yeah.

490
00:46:09,041 --> 00:46:14,721
What I just read is chapter 103, three paragraphs from the end.

491
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,641
How vain and foolish it begins.

492
00:46:18,641 --> 00:46:19,521
Okay.

493
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:46,520
Now, I was not wanting to get beyond your reading, but I have to because time is short for talking about Moby Dick, and I have to begin, maybe even finish, talking about something which those of you, those few of you who have the book, may not have read yet, but it is such a murky thing that it won't help, it won't hurt to talk about it before you read it.

494
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:50,841
And then you can check out what I'm saying when you do read it.

495
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:54,281
And it fits so perfectly in with what I'm saying.

496
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,761
Because the ocean is the unbounded.

497
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:07,561
The whale is the king of the sea, the paradigm of the unbounded, and we now, and unrepresentable, I hope I've convinced you of that.

498
00:47:08,441 --> 00:47:16,361
Now, what would be even more unrepresentable and unbounded than the ocean and the sperm whale?

499
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:24,441
This is an easy question if you just sort of think about the book.

500
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,721
How about a white whale?

501
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,280
A whale that is just blank.

502
00:47:30,601 --> 00:47:32,360
Well, that's the next stage.

503
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,920
Moby Dick isn't just any old sperm whale.

504
00:47:34,921 --> 00:47:41,481
Moby Dick is the paradigm of sperm whale because Moby Dick is white.

505
00:47:41,481 --> 00:47:45,081
And so I don't think he has any markings on his tail and so forth.

506
00:47:45,081 --> 00:47:47,001
He's even more indefinite.

507
00:47:47,001 --> 00:47:50,121
So now we have to start talking about whiteness.

508
00:47:50,121 --> 00:48:13,321
And there is a chapter on whiteness, chapter 42, which most people, as far as I know, have ignored in all their interpretations, Freudian, political, American, ecological, and yet it is the chapter that Melville says is the key to it all.

509
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,601
It's, in a sense, the most important chapter in the book.

510
00:48:16,601 --> 00:48:35,921
On my interpretation, it is, and I can explain why it is and has to be, given the way this whole book is laid out, this very interesting, very, what does he say, wicked understanding of reality that the book is.

511
00:48:35,921 --> 00:48:44,401
It's a wicked understanding of reality because it says that nothing is going to be able to give you any definite answer about the meaning of reality.

512
00:48:44,401 --> 00:48:46,401
It's all interpretations.

513
00:48:46,401 --> 00:48:55,521
And even if you came along and said, aha, but this is how the whale looks, and this is how the ocean is, and this is what reality is, Meldo would say, oh, that's good, that's terrific.

514
00:48:55,521 --> 00:48:58,081
Let's add it to our list of interpretations.

515
00:48:58,401 --> 00:49:10,881
He's got a system in which it's in principle impossible for you to come up with anything but, from his point of view, from his interpretation, another interpretation.

516
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,240
And that's all going on in the Whiteness chapter.

517
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:20,401
And you'll see, and that's why it turns out to be the, for him, the important chapter.

518
00:49:20,401 --> 00:49:23,121
It's the key chapter of the book.

519
00:49:23,121 --> 00:49:32,800
And he says that he hasn't explained it yet, at this point in the book, and of course he never will.

520
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,441
He begins the chapter, what the white whale was to Ahab has been hinted.

521
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:48,641
And Ahab, what the white whale is to Ahab is infuriating because Ahab wants clarity and he wants control and he wants an answer and he wants to understand what's going on.

522
00:49:48,641 --> 00:49:55,841
He's the guy driven crazy by the picture, the kind of person driven crazy by the picture.

523
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:01,281
So, but what at times he was to me as yet remains unsaid.

524
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:15,881
As I was rereading that today for the who knows how many times, I see how sort of unconsciously, but nonetheless consistently Melville never takes a stand on anything.

525
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:22,120
When he says about the picture that it's his theory that it's a whale back in the end, that's what he should say.

526
00:50:22,121 --> 00:50:27,241
And here he says, what at times he was for me remains unsaid.

527
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,240
That is, this is one of the ways.

528
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,280
This is like a mood.

529
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:34,680
When I'm in a certain mood, in a certain attunement, this is what the whale is for me.

530
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:41,641
That the whale means something specific to Melville, has one interpretation, and he's got it.

531
00:50:41,641 --> 00:50:44,040
That's just what he's alien.

532
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:56,841
So even his story about the whale as indefinite as God and as totally undecipherable and all that is a mood, is an interpretation.

533
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:09,160
But now we're going to get what at times, and it turns out the only time that he tells you about, and then really the most important time, I'm sure, what the whale is to him.

534
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,641
And now, how's he going to do it?

535
00:51:11,641 --> 00:51:15,081
Well, he's got to talk about whiteness.

536
00:51:15,081 --> 00:51:25,481
There was another thought or nameless horror concerning him, the whale, which at times in its intensity completely overpowered all the rest.

537
00:51:25,481 --> 00:51:34,921
And yet so mystical and well-nigh inethable was it that I almost despair of putting it into comprehensible form.

538
00:51:34,921 --> 00:51:36,840
This is 181.

539
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:41,160
It's the beginning of chapter 42, The Whiteness of the Whale.

540
00:51:41,481 --> 00:51:44,601
He says, but how can I hope to explain myself here?

541
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:52,280
And now the crucial thing, and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself, I must, else all these chapters might be naught.

542
00:51:52,280 --> 00:52:00,641
I mean, there's something, I've got to get you to understand, he's saying, what the whiteness of the whale means, even though I can hardly understand it myself.

543
00:52:00,961 --> 00:52:06,001
Because if you can't understand what the whiteness of the whale means, you can't understand the book.

544
00:52:06,001 --> 00:52:08,641
You can't understand Moby Dick, and so you can't understand the book.

545
00:52:08,641 --> 00:52:17,200
Now, in a certain way, you can understand them, but just the kind of non-understanding that the whiteness is is what's important.

546
00:52:17,521 --> 00:52:20,721
And so he starts to worry about what is whiteness.

547
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:28,160
And he does a brilliant sort of essay on whiteness for the rest of the chapter.

548
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:38,641
He starts out saying that whiteness is a kind of horrible thing.

549
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:50,081
And he says on 182, which is the middle of the page, same chapter all the time.

550
00:52:50,081 --> 00:52:57,601
In the innermost idea of this hue, that is whiteness, which strikes, well, now I better go back a little.

551
00:52:57,601 --> 00:53:01,521
Well, he's giving you a whole list of associations with white.

552
00:53:03,921 --> 00:53:12,400
The white bull, the white dog, the priest's robes, the vision of St.

553
00:53:12,401 --> 00:53:16,160
John had a white robe, and so forth and so forth.

554
00:53:17,441 --> 00:53:24,721
And there's an association with white with what is sweet, honorable, and sublime.

555
00:53:24,961 --> 00:53:26,080
He doesn't believe that.

556
00:53:26,081 --> 00:53:28,081
He said, well, maybe sublime.

557
00:53:28,961 --> 00:53:40,480
He says, yet there lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more a panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood.

558
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:46,680
So rather than any color and anything frightening, there's something worse.

559
00:53:46,921 --> 00:53:50,440
White is panic making.

560
00:53:50,601 --> 00:53:53,241
He can go into something very important there.

561
00:53:53,561 --> 00:53:58,121
He wants to make it, it's worse than frighten.

562
00:53:58,441 --> 00:54:10,440
Frightening is something threatening you in some particular way that you're going to hurt you or make you lose something or make you hurt somebody you care about.

563
00:54:10,441 --> 00:54:12,601
All that is frightening.

564
00:54:12,921 --> 00:54:27,480
Panic is this sort of total loss of everything, but not as specific, but just sort of total panic is sort of fear, is not even fear of everything.

565
00:54:27,481 --> 00:54:29,321
It's something stronger than that.

566
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,400
It's, I just can't say anything more.

567
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:32,921
It's just panic.

568
00:54:33,481 --> 00:54:35,961
And he tries to pin it down.

569
00:54:36,601 --> 00:54:45,081
So he's talking about maybe, he tries to go first by pinning it down maybe to the ultimate fear.

570
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:49,961
Maybe the panic is really the ultimate fear, namely the fear of death.

571
00:54:49,961 --> 00:54:56,361
Because after all, he says on 185, death rides a white horse.

572
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:09,881
Yea, while these terrors seize us, let us add that even the king of terrors, when personified, rides on a pallid horse.

573
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,601
But he's still in the fear business.

574
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:14,520
He really hasn't got it yet.

575
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:21,481
This is all threats to human being and human life.

576
00:55:21,481 --> 00:55:24,200
And fear is not what he's after.

577
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:29,601
There is what he calls a nameless dread, which comes out of this whiteness.

578
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:35,680
Dread is like the panic, maybe, or even more weird.

579
00:55:36,001 --> 00:55:44,401
So he goes on and talks about the getting us beyond the fearful on the middle of 185.

580
00:55:44,401 --> 00:56:07,200
Can we then, by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of whiteness, though for the time either wholly or in part stripped of all direct associations, calculated to impart to it aught fearful, but nevertheless is found to exert over us the same sorcery, however modified, so no matter how you try to get the fearfulness out of it, it still got it.

581
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:13,280
Can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek?

582
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:21,521
So is there something about the whiteness that goes beyond any kind of fear?

583
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:26,241
And then he thinks he finally got it on page 188.

584
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:30,720
Remember, it's not some particular threat coming at you in some particular direction.

585
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,001
It's not even the super threat of death.

586
00:56:34,001 --> 00:56:36,480
It's something more than that.

587
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:40,801
It's something, let's call it dread, because it doesn't seem to be fear.

588
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,280
And now he tells you 188 what it is.

589
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,001
It's pretty strange, two-thirds of the way down.

590
00:56:46,001 --> 00:56:47,680
And he does it in terms of questions.

591
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,481
He doesn't give you the answer, not milk.

592
00:56:50,481 --> 00:57:05,680
Is it that by its indefiniteness, it shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe and stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation when beholding the white depths of the Milky Way?

593
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,960
That's getting close.

594
00:57:06,961 --> 00:57:08,641
That's still not it.

595
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,601
But its indefiniteness is now in there, which is important.

596
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:15,881
The whiteness is not any particular color.

597
00:57:16,441 --> 00:57:24,841
And the whole sort of frightfulness of the universe is in there.

598
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:29,641
Pascal said he was the first to get the news that the universe was infinite.

599
00:57:29,641 --> 00:57:32,121
I mean, the first generation of people.

600
00:57:32,121 --> 00:57:36,041
And he said it terrified him.

601
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:38,041
But now that's not it yet.

602
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:50,441
Or is it that, as an essence, whiteness is not so much a color as the visible absence of color and at the same time the concrete of all colors?

603
00:57:50,760 --> 00:58:04,281
Is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness full of meaning in a wide landscape of snows, a colorless, all-color of atheism from which we shrink?

604
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,281
That's the crucial sentence.

605
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,920
It's pretty, pretty obscure.

606
00:58:08,921 --> 00:58:10,200
You can go back and look at it.

607
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,880
It's sort of almost bottom of 88.

608
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,481
I'll read it again.

609
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:21,561
But let me just tell you, sort of, it's important that whiteness isn't any color.

610
00:58:21,561 --> 00:58:25,401
It's an absence of all color.

611
00:58:26,041 --> 00:58:30,200
But it's also what you get if you put all the colors together.

612
00:58:31,401 --> 00:58:34,761
He's not thinking of putting them all in a painting where you would get black.

613
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:43,801
But if you put all the colors together in a shining with a projector on the wall in white, if you add all the colors, you get white.

614
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,361
That's what you get in the rainbow.

615
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:50,680
That's when you take the rainbow apart as a light beam.

616
00:58:51,001 --> 00:58:52,121
You get all the colors.

617
00:58:53,001 --> 00:58:54,521
Newton did that.

618
00:58:54,840 --> 00:59:03,601
So whiteness is, from Melville's point of view, the absence of all colors that you get by adding up all colors.

619
00:59:03,601 --> 00:59:05,520
That makes it a dumb blankness.

620
00:59:05,521 --> 00:59:06,801
That's the whiteness.

621
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:10,961
Full of meaning because it's got all the colors in it.

622
00:59:10,961 --> 00:59:14,481
It's the colorless, all color of atheism.

623
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,200
That is a mouthful.

624
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:23,601
And I can tell you maybe by the end of the hour what this is about.

625
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:32,240
This is an absolutely amazingly brilliant kind of metaphor for the understanding of meaning that Melville's got.

626
00:59:32,561 --> 00:59:35,120
But I'm going to get there slowly.

627
00:59:35,601 --> 00:59:37,280
There's a little more to spell out yet.

628
00:59:37,280 --> 01:00:15,521
And when we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers, that all other earthly use, every stately and lovely emblossomy, the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods, yea, and the gilded velvets of butterflies and the cheeks of young girls, all these are but subtle deceits, not actually inherent in substances, but only laid on from outside, so as all deified nature absolutely paints like a harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel house within.

629
01:00:15,521 --> 01:00:17,680
Boy, is that a mouthful.

630
01:00:18,001 --> 01:00:32,401
But that's a long, complicated way of saying, I think, that you've got to remember that the natural world, and he's just giving you sort of his contemporary science, which we still believe, it doesn't have any color.

631
01:00:32,401 --> 01:00:37,841
And it's just, it isn't even really white, it's just colorless.

632
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:45,001
And then if color equals meaning, as it does, sort of always, the universe is meaningless.

633
01:00:45,320 --> 01:01:05,401
And all the colors that we see are kind of an illusion of this meaningless radiation on this meaningless blob of matter in our skull and gives us this idea that nature is full of beautiful colors, that really that's our interaction with nature.

634
01:01:05,401 --> 01:01:08,041
Nature hasn't got any color.

635
01:01:08,041 --> 01:01:15,320
And so it's covering up the blankness of reality.

636
01:01:15,641 --> 01:01:19,081
But that's not what's getting him.

637
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:24,440
It gets closer to what's getting him at the end of the very end of the chapter, which we're getting close to.

638
01:01:24,441 --> 01:01:25,880
He already introduces it here.

639
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:32,200
He talks about, where does he talk about for a minute about the landscape of snow?

640
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:37,321
Yeah, the whiteness of snow is important for this.

641
01:01:37,641 --> 01:01:46,200
Condering all this, the palsy universe, P-A-L-S-I-U-V, does that?

642
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:47,481
Like shaking?

643
01:01:47,481 --> 01:01:48,041
No.

644
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:49,641
It doesn't mean pale.

645
01:01:50,441 --> 01:01:54,041
I thought it was too, but there you'd think it must mean pale in some way.

646
01:01:54,041 --> 01:01:56,760
I wonder if that's if there are two meanings or something.

647
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:00,680
The palsy universe would be sort of a universe with Parkinson.

648
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:03,401
That doesn't seem very normal or sensible.

649
01:02:03,561 --> 01:02:05,241
I wonder what that is.

650
01:02:05,561 --> 01:02:11,081
Well, there's so much hitting you at once when you read this that I have to look it up.

651
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:15,160
Now I have to write it down about all the new problems.

652
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:16,200
Look.

653
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,041
I don't know.

654
01:02:18,041 --> 01:02:19,561
Okay, let's anyway.

655
01:02:19,561 --> 01:02:22,921
The something universe lies before us a leper.

656
01:02:22,921 --> 01:02:26,281
A leper being pale, too, for him.

657
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:43,360
And the willful travelers in Lapland who refuse to wear colored glasses and coloring glass refuse to wear colored and coloring glasses upon their eyes, that is, don't have sunglasses.

658
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:54,160
So the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him.

659
01:02:54,160 --> 01:03:00,001
That means the whiteness of the whale is like the whiteness of snow.

660
01:03:00,001 --> 01:03:03,121
And if you are a non-believer, that's an infidel.

661
01:03:03,121 --> 01:03:20,881
And if you look into it without any protection by sunglasses, which are really interpretations that block out most of the color and only leaves a little of it, you will be blinded by it.

662
01:03:22,081 --> 01:03:29,680
And there is a character in the book, the very character who understands that everything is an interpretation.

663
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:33,200
When he understands that, goes blind.

664
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:34,641
Well, that's a long story.

665
01:03:34,641 --> 01:03:36,000
Keep your eye on Pip.

666
01:03:36,001 --> 01:03:41,121
Pip is a character who sees more than anybody else in the book, I guess.

667
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:48,480
And if true, anybody, yeah, I guess even more than Melville, maybe, according to the way this more than Ishmael, that is.

668
01:03:48,481 --> 01:03:57,521
Anyway, so that he gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him.

669
01:03:57,521 --> 01:04:00,080
Of all these things, this is the ending sentence.

670
01:04:00,081 --> 01:04:04,081
The albino whale was the symbol.

671
01:04:04,081 --> 01:04:06,561
Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt.

672
01:04:06,641 --> 01:04:08,081
Oh, you won't understand that.

673
01:04:08,081 --> 01:04:12,321
That's Ahab not being able to stand the whiteness coming in.

674
01:04:12,441 --> 01:04:21,001
But I take it that the glasses cover up the whiteness with a single interpretation.

675
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,961
And why is that wrong?

676
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:26,441
Well, we're back to that again.

677
01:04:26,441 --> 01:04:31,401
It's wrong because it limits you of being open to all the other interpretations.

678
01:04:31,401 --> 01:04:41,160
You shouldn't, the right way to look at the whiteness is not by wearing one tinted dark glasses.

679
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:44,120
So what is the right way to look at the whiteness?

680
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:49,961
If you really understand the structure of the book, you'll understand what the answer that has to be.

681
01:04:49,961 --> 01:04:53,641
But I'm sure you don't, and it took me years to understand it.

682
01:04:53,641 --> 01:04:56,601
And I sometimes wonder whether even Melville understands it.

683
01:04:56,601 --> 01:05:08,041
That in the sense that it's so sort of woven through the book in a funny, marginal-ish way that I have no idea how important it is to him.

684
01:05:08,041 --> 01:05:09,880
But where are we?

685
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:17,481
So we lay on these interpretations.

686
01:05:18,121 --> 01:05:24,920
If you lay on only one interpretation, you leave out all the others.

687
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,241
That's the dark glasses.

688
01:05:27,561 --> 01:05:48,121
If you add up a lot of interpretations, each one of which, if some observer adds up a lot of interpretations of reality, each one of which takes itself to be the right answer, you also get whiteness, and they all cancel each other out.

689
01:05:48,121 --> 01:05:51,081
What in the world else can you do?

690
01:05:51,401 --> 01:05:58,401
Well, I'm going to jump ahead, but I don't want to, but I don't want to run out of time either, so let me skim to where the bottom line is here.

691
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:06,960
So, you don't want to, what, how do you get meaning out of a dumb blankness full of meaning?

692
01:06:07,601 --> 01:06:13,041
Well, the answer is, in a way, Newton did it.

693
01:06:13,041 --> 01:06:19,281
That is, what you have to do is turn the whiteness into a rainbow.

694
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:32,321
To turn the whiteness into a rainbow is to get a whole spectrum of interpretations, to be able to see it from the whiteness like from wearing lots of different glasses.

695
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:36,960
It's to be able to be open to color meanings.

696
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:42,000
And when I came up with this, I went to see how there's a dumb blankness full of meanings.

697
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:47,041
You can get in sync with different meanings with each different interpretation.

698
01:06:48,800 --> 01:07:09,200
And if you try to add them up as answers, let's see, without trying to tell you, instead of using one-color glasses, if you could look at the whiteness with a whole variety of interpretations, you would get a rainbow of colors.

699
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,041
And that's polytheism.

700
01:07:11,521 --> 01:07:24,721
His metaphor for polytheism is a whole bunch of different perspectives, a whole bunch of different moods, a whole bunch of different interpretations, a whole bunch of different gods.

701
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:31,200
If you all try to add it up, it gives you this terrifying dumb blankness.

702
01:07:31,201 --> 01:07:39,760
But if you live in the openness to all the colors, then you live in the rainbow.

703
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:50,200
Now, I came up with this after years of reading this, and I thought, well, this is a crazy idea, but does he ever say it?

704
01:07:50,201 --> 01:07:52,840
And the answer is, yes, he does finally say it.

705
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:56,200
Way at the end of the book, on 541.

706
01:07:56,201 --> 01:08:00,360
He tells you what the story about the whale and the rainbow.

707
01:08:00,361 --> 01:08:02,441
Wow, 541?

708
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:05,240
No, 362, maybe.

709
01:08:05,241 --> 01:08:06,440
Let's hope.

710
01:08:06,441 --> 01:08:08,521
I don't want to lose my punchline.

711
01:08:08,521 --> 01:08:09,160
There we are.

712
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,320
This is the answer.

713
01:08:11,321 --> 01:08:24,760
Now, on the very last paragraph of 85, he's going to put the whiteness together with the rainbow and the whale all together.

714
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:53,240
And now, and how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, that's Moby Dick, to behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea, his vast mile ahead overhung by a canopy of vapor, engendered by his incommunicable contemplations, and that vapor, as you will sometimes see it, glorified by a rainbow, as if heaven had put his seal upon his thoughts.

715
01:08:53,241 --> 01:08:57,320
Now, you think, well, boy, that is just a passing thing, big deal.

716
01:08:57,321 --> 01:09:01,880
But he goes on, for do you see, rainbows do not visit the clear air.

717
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:04,120
They only radiate the vapor.

718
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:13,240
And so, through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind, now we're going to turn it into polytheism of sorts and moodism.

719
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:21,080
Through the dim doubts in my mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray.

720
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:25,561
And for this, I thank God, for all have doubts, many deny.

721
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:30,000
The doubts are denials, few among them have intuitions.

722
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,040
Doubts of all things earthly and intuitions of some things heavenly.

723
01:09:35,040 --> 01:10:06,720
This combination makes neither a believer, that's onto theology, that's Christianity, nor an infidel, that's atheist, but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye, that is, who rejects them both, and has polytheism, has an openness to a whole range of interpretations, which, and you've got to keep repeating this, you can't add them up and say, well, if there are a lot of different interpretations, let's unify them into one unified interpretation.

724
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:09,680
Because if you add up all the colors, what do you get?

725
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,840
Whiteness, blankness.

726
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,000
They cancel each other out.

727
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:23,680
The only way to preserve them is to preserve them as if they were moods or intuitions or interpretations.

728
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:29,040
And then you can enjoy them, and then the whiteness doesn't upset you anymore.

729
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:37,840
Then the whiteness seems exactly the, it's the only kind of meaningfulness you've got, and it's the only kind of meaningfulness you need.

730
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:52,000
Now, I don't expect you to believe on the basis of one paragraph, but there are two whole chapters which spell out this intuition.

731
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,920
And I'll tell you what they are.

732
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,720
We can't get to them for a while.

733
01:10:56,720 --> 01:11:02,320
There's one called the Dago, which is that's the chapter about interpretation.

734
01:11:02,561 --> 01:11:06,000
They're the chapter, something in the Archides.

735
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,481
I forget the chapel in the Archides, maybe.

736
01:11:08,481 --> 01:11:10,481
That's the amazing one.

737
01:11:10,481 --> 01:11:24,760
Because there he takes the whole story he's told you about colors and how they add up to a dumb blankness if you put them all together, but how they spread into a rainbow if you look at them spread out.

738
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:26,360
He does it with sound.

739
01:11:26,601 --> 01:11:31,800
He tells you the same story that he told you with the whale swimming in the water.

740
01:11:32,441 --> 01:11:37,240
The chapel in the Archides is the people who worship the skeleton of the whale.

741
01:11:37,241 --> 01:11:43,880
And in describing what happens when you worship the skeleton of the whale, he tells you the whole structure again acoustically.

742
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,720
So there is this deep structure.

743
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:51,960
When I say I don't know whether he knows it or not, it's the casualness that these things come in.
