1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,320
Okay, then I'm going to go back, starting with Pip, and then I'm going to go on and talk about Ahab, which I've been putting off.

2
00:00:10,321 --> 00:01:54,481
And then I'm going to talk about three different ways to get meaning in your life after the you don't you can't believe in this mono mono meaning anymore and that well that's what that's today's assign I mean that's what I want to cover today and it's all and and also one of those is about moods so I want to talk about the the mood on one of the on the Enderby one of the ships that they meet but first Pip is so important I want to go back and send it's been so long a week since we talked about Pip and we ended saying what I thought was interesting stuff about the sense in which he's a bat that I want to get back to so let's just start by reviewing Pip so what why is he so important well because he actually saw what goes on that makes the he saw creation he saw God's foot upon the treadle of the womb the womb is the way everything gets woven together to create the I don't know what to say the world the universe the creation it's it's I don't there's no word for it I guess then I Melville says the something orbs as I call I think where is it now so he was at the bottom of 401 carried down alive to wondrous depths where strange shapes of the unwarped wrapped unwrapped when I read these things aloud I suddenly, discover words that I don't expect.

3
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,721
Unwrapped primal world.

4
00:01:56,721 --> 00:01:57,681
Am I seeing it right?

5
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,801
I'm dyslexic, but it certainly looks like unwrapped.

6
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:02,241
Unwarped?

7
00:02:02,241 --> 00:02:03,601
Unwrapped.

8
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:05,201
Unwarped?

9
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,760
Unwarped.

10
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:08,880
That's better.

11
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,961
Although it's still pretty mysterious.

12
00:02:11,361 --> 00:02:12,801
At least it's what's there.

13
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:23,681
The unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes, and the miser merman wisdom revealed his horrid hoarded heaps.

14
00:02:23,681 --> 00:02:28,320
And among the joyous, heartless, ever juvenile eternities, Pip saw, and now comes what?

15
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:39,760
These crucial things, the multitudinous God-omnipresent coral insects that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs.

16
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:48,560
The colossal orbs is his word, since he can't say creation, because that's for the Christians, and he can't say universe because the scientists have taken it over.

17
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:55,841
And I don't think he should say world, because world is something that human beings are in, like the business world or the academic world.

18
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,520
So he's got a problem, and he solves it in this interesting way.

19
00:02:59,521 --> 00:03:09,200
So out, so he see, and the coral insects are these fat, the are, what can you say?

20
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:21,361
That it amounts to a kind of random activity on these insects that don't know what they're doing, which, because they all do it, produces, guess what?

21
00:03:21,361 --> 00:03:24,400
Another rainbow, the coral.

22
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:30,241
And that's pretty weird and amazing talk.

23
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:34,320
He saw, and he goes on, he saw God's foot upon the treadle of the loom.

24
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:51,361
There's this Melville belief that the bottom line is a kind of random gathering of, period, of anything and everything that produces this world or universe, well, this bunch of orbs that we live in.

25
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:59,400
So he saw the foot upon the treadle of the loom and spoke it, and his therefore his shipmates called him mad.

26
00:03:59,401 --> 00:04:02,760
And we might as well go on because it's all Nelville-y here.

27
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,280
So man's insanity is heaven's sense.

28
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:07,880
I don't know what that means.

29
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:19,640
I think it means, I mean, what looks like insanity to the people who see Pip is really a sense that Pip has seen more than anybody else deeply into the nature of things.

30
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:34,280
And wandering from all mortal reason, man comes at last to that celestial thought which to reason is absurd and frantic and wheeled and woe, feels then uncompromised, indifferent as his God.

31
00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:56,841
Boy, when Nelville is on to these very deep things, he writes, I'm sure he writes without thinking at all, but he's tuned in in his moody way to something which he expresses in this brilliant, beautiful, and barely comprehensible story about what Pip saw.

32
00:04:57,161 --> 00:05:17,241
And I want to repeat that it's so interesting that he saw the sort of random activity of the coral insects, which with no plan, but which kind of accidentally seems to produce all these orbs and all these rainbow of meanings.

33
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,401
But what he saw blew his mind.

34
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,320
He can't understand it.

35
00:05:23,401 --> 00:05:27,721
I think this paragraph is probably supposed to blow your mind in the same way.

36
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,401
And all he's got left is pure openness.

37
00:05:31,401 --> 00:05:33,320
He's lost his identity.

38
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,321
He's lost his perspective.

39
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,601
He doesn't have any perspective anymore.

40
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,441
He's open to all interpretations because he has no interpretation of his own.

41
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:53,521
That gets us up to where we were last time, which is how he interprets the chapter about the Debloon.

42
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:54,640
Only, where am I?

43
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,921
I am lost.

44
00:05:55,921 --> 00:05:57,041
Oh, no, I'm not.

45
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:57,921
Okay.

46
00:05:57,921 --> 00:06:01,281
So in the no, no, I see.

47
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,841
I'm quoting on 500 at the top.

48
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,841
I'm just arguing at this point that he's got no identity.

49
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,240
He says, Pip, whom call ye Pip?

50
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,761
Pip jumped from the whale boat.

51
00:06:11,761 --> 00:06:13,281
Pip's missing.

52
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:17,440
And that means, that's what I mean by saying it blew his mind.

53
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,801
He can't think anymore.

54
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:21,441
He has no identity anymore.

55
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:28,801
But that enables him to give this amazing interpretation of the doubloon.

56
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,840
And now what I don't see, help me find the doubloon chapter.

57
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,761
I didn't mark it, oddly enough.

58
00:06:38,401 --> 00:06:39,600
4 what?

59
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,921
415?

60
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,921
Okay, well that's what we want.

61
00:06:43,921 --> 00:06:49,601
And now at the end, we get Pip.

62
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,841
The thing I want to comment on is 420.

63
00:06:54,161 --> 00:07:01,921
But I want to say that how totally blank Pip is.

64
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:13,761
I think you get the impression, I don't know any quote for it, but not only does he see that everything is an interpretation, well, the Debloon chapter is the quote for it.

65
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:18,241
It looks like he understands that everything is an interpretation.

66
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,440
Remember, I look, we look, they look, and so forth.

67
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:33,881
Everybody sees a totally different interpretation in the Debloom, which represents the world, and that there aren't even better and worse interpretations.

68
00:07:33,881 --> 00:07:53,241
Because usually people who have this kind of interpretation view, people whose names you won't recognize, but Charles Taylor and Alexander Nahamis, famous philosophers who talk about Nietzsche's view that everything is interpretation, make a big fuss about that there are good and bad interpretations.

69
00:07:53,240 --> 00:08:08,841
But I think Pip has seen the sort of total randomness of the way all this hangs together, although it all hangs together, it's woven together, but I don't think he has any sense of better and worse interpretations.

70
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,121
And that's really no wonder he went mad.

71
00:08:12,121 --> 00:08:18,361
I mean, there's just no place from which to understand anything for him.

72
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:28,520
So he just says, and this is what we read it last time on 420, I look, you look, he looks, we look, ye look, they look, and so forth.

73
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:30,921
And he says it three times.

74
00:08:30,921 --> 00:08:34,361
And I've just said what I think it means.

75
00:08:35,001 --> 00:08:39,401
But now comes these funny lines where we stopped last time.

76
00:08:39,401 --> 00:08:45,720
And you've got to be aware of overinterpreting all this, but I'll do my I'll do I'll give you an interpretation.

77
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,080
We talked about it.

78
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,840
They they're all bats.

79
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,320
I, you, and he and we and ye and they are all bats.

80
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,320
I'm a crow, especially when I stand at the top of this pine tree here.

81
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:21,761
Well, one reason they're all bats is they are blind and crazy, all of them, because each of them runs up to the doubloon and, in spite of the fact that the other ones have given it a totally other interpretation, gives it as if it was the only right interpretation, their interpretation.

82
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:27,121
Each of them, Stubb and Flast, and Ahab and Starbuck.

83
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:36,801
And what Pip sees, what Ishmael Melville sees, is that there's just a plurality of interpretations.

84
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:39,521
None of them's right, none of them's better.

85
00:09:39,521 --> 00:09:45,841
And nobody sees that except Pip when he's at the top of the mast.

86
00:09:46,161 --> 00:09:51,441
I think now, I used to think that Pip saw the same thing as Ishmael saw.

87
00:09:51,440 --> 00:10:00,961
But I think Ishmael isn't viewing the whole thing from some external sort of meta-perspective the way Pip is.

88
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:10,081
Pip hasn't got his own perspective, but when he's up in the crow's nest, he sees there are all these perspectives, they're all equal.

89
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,121
And when he sees that, he's not in any of them.

90
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,400
And he's not able to get into any of them.

91
00:10:18,401 --> 00:10:23,281
That's the sense in which he's gotten no identity anymore.

92
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:28,401
And so that Ishmael is able to get into all of them, or at least many of them.

93
00:10:28,401 --> 00:10:35,601
He also sees that there are many interpretations, has many moods, but he's always in one or another.

94
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,281
He isn't crazy, and he hasn't lost his identity, and so forth.

95
00:10:39,281 --> 00:10:42,721
And there's a big difference between the two.

96
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,641
But Pip's got a sort of valid meta-interpretation.

97
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:59,161
I mean, he really does see from an open, totally receptive position or something like that, the way the whole thing works.

98
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:07,560
He sees it from the very bottom at the ocean, and then he goes up and he sees where the insects are making all these weird colors.

99
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,441
And then he goes to the top of the crow's at the crow's nest and he sees the whole thing from the top.

100
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,081
So he's seen more than anybody.

101
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,081
And that's important.

102
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:25,401
And he says, and now this is when somebody said and gave me a hard time, that they're all bats.

103
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,720
I'm just looking at my notes.

104
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,481
I still believed when I wrote these notes this morning that his view was the same as Ishmael's.

105
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,081
I don't believe it anymore.

106
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:37,401
But now, how can he say that he's a bat?

107
00:11:37,401 --> 00:11:41,161
He's seen it, he's seen everything, as I say, from the top to the bottom.

108
00:11:41,161 --> 00:11:45,801
And you can't really say he's understood it, because it's not understandable.

109
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:48,121
It's supposed to blow your mind when you read it.

110
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:54,281
But he somehow got it from the top to the bottom.

111
00:11:54,281 --> 00:12:02,761
Even though he can't understand it or say it, he does live it, namely, in his crazy way.

112
00:12:02,761 --> 00:12:05,801
But he's not really crazy.

113
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:08,041
He's got heaven's sense.

114
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,801
He's got, again, that's another way to put it.

115
00:12:09,801 --> 00:12:15,241
He's got the ultimate perspective on everything, which isn't even a perspective anymore.

116
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,241
And he's not crazy.

117
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,161
And he's not blind.

118
00:12:19,161 --> 00:12:22,441
The other people are all blind as bats.

119
00:12:22,761 --> 00:12:26,761
Or they're bats in the sense of your batty, crazy.

120
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,801
But I don't think either one of those fits him.

121
00:12:29,801 --> 00:12:31,401
So why is he a bat?

122
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:34,440
Well, here's where I risk, I worried about that.

123
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,641
This is where we ended with me running after you, sort of yelling at the last lines.

124
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:43,840
And I went back and listened to that part of the podcast for saying, I don't know what to say.

125
00:12:43,921 --> 00:12:45,041
It's very interesting.

126
00:12:45,521 --> 00:12:50,000
I wonder in what sense he's a bat.

127
00:12:50,001 --> 00:12:51,440
And somebody said, who said it?

128
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,121
He sees in the dark, bats see in the dark.

129
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:55,840
Okay, good.

130
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,401
I think that's the right thing to say.

131
00:12:58,401 --> 00:13:03,681
That's not being crazy, and that's not being blind.

132
00:13:03,921 --> 00:13:08,720
But what I found was a quote to back up that view of yours.

133
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,080
I mean, I felt uneasy just, I thought, well, that's a nice association of bats, but we've already got two.

134
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:20,241
That's blind is a bat, and batty, now we're supposed to believe a third association about bats.

135
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:32,241
Well, it is true that Melville thinks that on 52, he says darkness is the proper element of our essences, about 20 lines down.

136
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:46,641
So if he's a bat, it's because he's in the dark, but he's in the dark, not sort of bumping into things, but somehow deeply understanding things.

137
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,960
That's all that's about two-thirds down on 52.

138
00:13:51,681 --> 00:13:54,561
I don't know if that's the right answer, but at least it's an answer.

139
00:13:54,561 --> 00:13:57,040
If I saw it on a paper, I'd be impressed.

140
00:13:57,361 --> 00:14:01,760
So I think we should stick with it unless anybody comes up with anything better.

141
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:07,841
So, okay, now I've finished talking about Pip and reviewing and going a little further.

142
00:14:07,841 --> 00:14:10,641
I'm ready to go on to the next one.

143
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,760
And the transition is on 501.

144
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,921
It goes right naturally from Pip to Ahab.

145
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,720
And that's the last thing of that chapter in which Pip is the main character.

146
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,560
And then comes the end.

147
00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:29,481
There go two daft ones now, muttered the Manxman.

148
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:35,720
Remember, they think Pip is crazy, but we don't think Pip is crazy, and Melville doesn't think he's crazy.

149
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,960
But anyway, there goes two daft ones now, muttered the old Manxman.

150
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,000
One daft with strength, the other daft with weakness.

151
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,401
Well, he's crazy with weakness in the sense that he's lost the capacity to interpret anything.

152
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:57,240
That's, again, the openness, the non-identity, the sheer receptivity that he's got.

153
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:05,080
It certainly is a kind of craziness and a kind of weakness, and that's all that the Manxman can understand of it.

154
00:15:05,081 --> 00:15:09,240
But now, all I want to do is use that to make a transition to Ahab.

155
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,520
We haven't talked about Ahab, who is certainly crazy with strength.

156
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:21,960
Only what in the world his craziness consists in, and in what way its strength, is what we want to talk about.

157
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:34,600
But I just want to make sure before we leave Pip, because it's so interesting and obscure and fundamental, that there isn't some other bright remarks brewing somewhere that I should learn from.

158
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:38,760
You don't have to have an opinion.

159
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,480
It's pretty hard to have an opinion, but just in case you do, I don't want to miss it.

160
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,360
Okay, well, then I'm going on.

161
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:48,520
And yeah, good.

162
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,800
Kevin.

163
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,200
But you've got to yell real loud.

164
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,641
I can't hear you.

165
00:15:53,641 --> 00:15:55,080
In the crow's nest, he's here.

166
00:15:55,081 --> 00:15:55,561
That's right.

167
00:15:55,561 --> 00:15:57,801
He sees it from the point of view of the crow's nest.

168
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:03,880
Well, he's seen.

169
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:11,280
I'm not sure why that's important when you're saying he's at a point where he doesn't get involved at all.

170
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:13,521
Maybe you're sort of agreeing with Anson, in anything.

171
00:16:13,841 --> 00:16:15,921
He has no perspective, no goal.

172
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:17,600
He's not in charge of anything.

173
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,520
So what are you saying about it?

174
00:16:20,881 --> 00:16:29,521
He can see it, and he can't control it, and in a certain way, he can't even understand it because there are all these conflicting perspectives.

175
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:36,320
We just saw in the case of the doubloon, and all these people are running around, each one in their world doing their thing in their mood.

176
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:40,801
He can see it, but so he doesn't do anything with it.

177
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,881
I mean, it doesn't seem to need a help.

178
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,921
What don't I?

179
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,681
He just accepts it.

180
00:16:47,681 --> 00:17:00,641
Okay, I think he accepts it, but I think he sees that everybody's crazy, everybody's giving interpretations, everybody thinks their interpretation is the interpretation.

181
00:17:00,641 --> 00:17:02,000
That's what he sees.

182
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:12,641
Okay, and that's what he sees from above all these interpretations, because he doesn't have an interpretation, and he's the only one who doesn't have an interpretation, except perhaps for Ishmael.

183
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,641
And Ishmael, it isn't that Ishmael has no interpretations, he has them all, the rainbow.

184
00:17:18,641 --> 00:17:20,560
He has lots of interpretations.

185
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:25,681
And that's not what we're interested in at this point.

186
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:26,721
Let me go on.

187
00:17:27,121 --> 00:17:29,600
If you have more to tell me about it, come and tell me.

188
00:17:29,601 --> 00:17:32,480
Okay, I'm ready to go to Ahab.

189
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:40,560
Now, Ahab is called, I'll give you the quote later, a monomaniac.

190
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:50,200
I mean, I think he's the kind he's a monotheist, but a kind of no normal kind of monotheist.

191
00:17:50,081 --> 00:17:56,681
But he wants, he demands one answer to the meaning of the universe.

192
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,881
So he's a monomaniac monotheist.

193
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,161
That's his job in the book, so to speak.

194
00:18:03,161 --> 00:18:15,960
It's more, it's not that he has what he thinks is the answer the way the Presbyterians do and the philosophers and the scientists, all of those are mono people too.

195
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:26,520
But he thinks there must be an answer to the one single meaning of the universe, and he absolutely demands the answer.

196
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:32,360
He can't stand the indefiniteness of not knowing.

197
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:40,280
So he's sort of the drive toward, he's the monomaniac drive toward monotheism in the book.

198
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,641
And I just have to tell you, but you should be able to figure this out.

199
00:18:43,641 --> 00:18:45,401
I don't want to give away too much of the plot.

200
00:18:45,401 --> 00:18:47,720
Of course, he's very dangerous.

201
00:18:48,280 --> 00:19:02,040
And Melville thinks that this kind of monomaniac monotheism is some sort of disaster in the culture and some kind of sickness in human beings that's gotten really out of control in our culture.

202
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,641
So now, but now we have to look at Ahab in more detail.

203
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,560
And again, he's very sort of obscure and confusing.

204
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:14,921
Melville's treatment of Ahab is certainly not my favorite thing in the book.

205
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:20,681
I can't understand, but I'll do my best to lay out what I can understand.

206
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,401
What is in detail Ahab up to?

207
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:31,720
I mean, that he's got this big problem that he demands to understand the meaning of it all.

208
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,000
That's clear enough.

209
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,760
But his way of going about sort of expressing this problem is very obscure and confused.

210
00:19:36,121 --> 00:19:41,281
And maybe it's that way on purpose.

211
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,480
Maybe that's what Melville wants us to see.

212
00:19:44,800 --> 00:20:17,760
But so after, here I wrote: after 2,000 years in the West of onto theological answers, starting with really the Aeneid already, where Rome and Augustus were the meaning of it all, leading it, it all led up to them, and certainly in Dante, where it all culminated, as you know, in this one total picture of the universe, every detail created by God to bound as in one volume and so forth.

213
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:23,360
After 2,000 years of that, people have become addicted to that.

214
00:20:23,361 --> 00:20:27,681
This is sort of Nietzsche's view, but I also think it's Melville's.

215
00:20:27,681 --> 00:20:31,200
And Ahab is addicted to that.

216
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:44,401
And he doesn't, he's a whole hero ahead of Peleg and Bildad, who are just Orthodox Christians, for instance, who think it's easy to get an answer to the meaning of it all.

217
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:57,120
He's not satisfied with any of the answers that come down from this tradition through the institutions and how people are brought up and in the language and everything.

218
00:20:57,121 --> 00:21:07,840
He wants a personal answer which gives him evidence, personal evidence, finding out what's really going on in this world.

219
00:21:07,841 --> 00:21:12,161
So you're going to, but now it becomes what's weird about him.

220
00:21:12,161 --> 00:21:28,521
He's going to try to force the, I guess I'll call it the universe, because that turns out to be a word that goes back to the Latin already, I think I told you, and it doesn't, it was only modern science now has taken it over.

221
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:35,720
So it means this meaningless but law-governed thing, the big expanding thing that we're in.

222
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,320
But I'm going to use universe for God, some more general term.

223
00:21:39,321 --> 00:21:51,641
So he's going to force the universe, or maybe God, if there is a God, to give this answer, or he's going to find out for sure there isn't.

224
00:21:51,641 --> 00:21:56,600
And if there is a God, he wants to find out whether he's a good God or a bad God.

225
00:21:56,921 --> 00:21:58,841
And then there's this further complication.

226
00:21:58,841 --> 00:22:02,280
I'm saying all this ahead of time, and I will give you the quotes to back it up.

227
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:12,120
He wants assurance that this God, if there is one, takes account of Ahab, that Ahab matters in the universe.

228
00:22:12,121 --> 00:22:16,841
All that he wants to settle.

229
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:35,721
And his way of going about settling it is to try to provoke this God or gods or whatever, the force, whatever it is, provoke it into manifesting itself and manifesting whether it's good or bad.

230
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,800
That's what he's trying to do.

231
00:22:39,561 --> 00:22:47,881
And this is tied up in a very peculiar way, which I think I understand, but if I do, it's funny because nobody else does.

232
00:22:47,881 --> 00:22:50,600
But you'll see, you can judge for yourself in a minute.

233
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:55,881
This is all, of course, tied up with somehow with the fact that he's lost his leg to Moby Dick.

234
00:22:55,881 --> 00:23:01,320
You've got to get a very thick stew of ideas and issues that are involved here.

235
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:08,881
And Ahab, I'm still sort of giving you the background, can't stand uncertainty.

236
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,241
That's just another way to put this.

237
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:17,840
This question has been answered, and he's done have his answer, and he needs an answer.

238
00:23:17,841 --> 00:23:24,641
You get this, for instance, on way off back in 453, but nothing about the plot is given away.

239
00:23:24,641 --> 00:23:31,600
I just want to read you a little quote: Ahab says to the carpenter, two-thirds of the way down.

240
00:23:32,881 --> 00:23:37,120
He has a vice, you know, the kind of thing carpenters have to squeeze things.

241
00:23:37,361 --> 00:23:40,801
This is a cogent vice thou hast, Carpenter.

242
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,960
Let me feel its grip once.

243
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,360
So, so it does pinch some.

244
00:23:45,361 --> 00:23:47,121
Oh, sir, it will break bones.

245
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:48,560
Beware, beware.

246
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:50,881
No fear, I like a good grip.

247
00:23:50,881 --> 00:23:55,280
I like to feel something in this slippery world that could hold, man.

248
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:56,401
That's it.

249
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:57,761
He wants something solid.

250
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,801
He wants an answer.

251
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:04,001
He doesn't want this constant play of interpretations and rainbows.

252
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,521
That's just a short version of it.

253
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:13,520
It comes up, I'll show you again how it comes up with Quequeg, that clear demand on his part.

254
00:24:13,841 --> 00:24:18,161
And that clear demand on his part, it isn't me that's calling him a monomaniac.

255
00:24:18,161 --> 00:24:37,360
I don't know how many times, but he's called a monomaniac, but at least on 177, where they were talking about his losing his leg at the bottom paragraph, is it not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment?

256
00:24:37,361 --> 00:24:41,840
So now we've got the problem of how to get all that together.

257
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:52,041
And so here, we're now going to talk about things that Ahab does because, well, no, we're going to just first give you a description of Ahab.

258
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,481
I really haven't ever done that.

259
00:24:51,601 --> 00:24:57,561
I've told you sort of his metaphysical demand.

260
00:24:57,881 --> 00:25:08,200
On 118, you get a description of him as the kind of person that he is, the middle of 118.

261
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:19,801
There was an infinity of firmest fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable willfulness in the fixed and fearless forward dedication of that glance.

262
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:23,720
Not a word he spoke, nor did his officers and so forth.

263
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:30,921
And then a little further down, and not only at the end of the paragraph, and not only that, but moody, good old moods again.

264
00:25:30,921 --> 00:25:32,760
Moody, stricken Ahab.

265
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,800
He's stuck in one mood is another way to describe.

266
00:25:36,361 --> 00:25:39,081
Moody, and that's part of being a monomaniac.

267
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:48,921
Moody-stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face and all the nameless, regal, overbearing dignity of some mighty woe.

268
00:25:48,921 --> 00:25:53,401
So now we have to, that's way back at the beginning of the book.

269
00:25:53,401 --> 00:26:03,720
And you might think the mighty woe is, after all, Moby did bit off his leg, but it's that's part of it.

270
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:19,240
But I'm trying to prepare you for the idea that his really mighty woe is that he absolutely wants a firm grip on things, a real answer, a ground, and so forth, something like the land, but he wants it at sea and he wants it total.

271
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:24,361
I mean, he is from Nantucket, which is trying to turn the land in the sea into the land.

272
00:26:24,361 --> 00:26:28,600
And there is that side of him, and always.

273
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:35,761
So now, oh, there's another place I wrote down that he can't stand uncertainty.

274
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:38,240
It may be the Queque one.

275
00:26:38,881 --> 00:26:40,401
No, that's the one I just read.

276
00:26:35,641 --> 00:26:41,600
Okay, I did that.

277
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:50,401
So he manifests a lot of strange activity.

278
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:57,280
And the prophet talks about that at one point that they run into before they board the boat.

279
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,320
And I want to talk about that for a moment.

280
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:09,760
This is before, and I want to emphasize that it's important, that this is before Mohi ever encounters Moby Dick and loses his way.

281
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:15,120
He's already got a, so to speak, chip on his shoulder vis-a-vis the universe.

282
00:27:15,121 --> 00:27:28,560
He's already doing everything he can by a kind of defiance to get the universe to declare, one, whether it's good or evil, and two, whether he's important or not.

283
00:27:28,561 --> 00:27:37,200
So it starts on 89, where you hear a lot of the weird things he's done prior to Moby Dick.

284
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,560
The top of 89, the bottom of 89.

285
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:45,040
The prophets saying all the things they don't know about Ahab.

286
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:52,960
But nothing about that thing that happened to him off Cape Horn long ago when he lay like dead for three days and nights.

287
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,401
I have no idea what that is.

288
00:27:54,401 --> 00:27:57,921
And as far as I know, it's never mentioned again, so I can't tell you.

289
00:27:57,921 --> 00:27:59,440
But there's plenty of other stuff.

290
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,640
Nothing about the deadly skirmish with the Spaniards before the altar in Spain.

291
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:09,361
Now, I suppose he was going to desecrate the altar, and they stopped him.

292
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:14,001
Because if you go on, nothing about the silver calabash he spat into.

293
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,561
He spits into the holy water.

294
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:19,361
It's getting clearer that he's trying to provoke.

295
00:28:19,361 --> 00:28:24,440
And nothing about his losing his leg last voyage, according to the prophecy.

296
00:28:24,681 --> 00:28:29,800
That's the last of the outrageous things that's happened to him.

297
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:40,440
And Ahab says that he's trying to provoke the gods to show themselves and define what the universe is like.

298
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:54,520
On 161, about two-thirds down, he says to the gods, whom he doesn't know whether there are any, you've knocked me down, and I am up again, but ye have run and hidden.

299
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,720
Come forth from behind your cotton bags.

300
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:07,800
So the meaning of the universe and whether there are any gods is hidden, according to Ahab on 161, and he's going to make it give an answer.

301
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:13,960
Now, we get to see this in first person, I mean, real life, so to speak, not just told by the prophet.

302
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:20,600
Ahab says, now we're on way on 486, two-thirds of the way down.

303
00:29:20,601 --> 00:29:27,800
He's holding on to the lightning rod, and lightning is striking, a kind of feet lightning, ocean lightning effect.

304
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:34,120
And he says, O thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as a Persian once did worship.

305
00:29:34,121 --> 00:29:36,280
Heaven only knows what that means.

306
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:40,921
Here in the sacramental act, so burned by thee that to this hour I bear the scar.

307
00:29:40,921 --> 00:29:43,000
He does have a scar on his face.

308
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,161
I now know thee, thou clear spirit.

309
00:29:45,401 --> 00:29:48,361
I know that thy right worship is defiance.

310
00:29:48,681 --> 00:29:50,440
And so this is sort of summing up.

311
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,001
That's what the fight over with the Spanish was.

312
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,360
That's what spitting in the silver calabash was.

313
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:59,641
That's what the fight before the altar was.

314
00:29:59,641 --> 00:30:01,001
They were all defiance.

315
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:08,401
And at the bottom, about 10 lines from the bottom, in the midst of the personified impersonal, a personality stands here.

316
00:30:08,401 --> 00:30:12,001
And that's again to say, in effect, pay attention to me.

317
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,881
You want to say something?

318
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:13,360
Good.

319
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,800
What?

320
00:30:16,161 --> 00:30:17,120
What page am I on?

321
00:30:17,121 --> 00:30:19,681
Sorry, 486 at the bottom.

322
00:30:19,921 --> 00:30:21,361
Well, two-thirds down.

323
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,881
Oh, thou clear spirit.

324
00:30:22,881 --> 00:30:24,000
You see where I am now?

325
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,561
Okay, good.

326
00:30:24,561 --> 00:30:28,960
Just stop me when I go too fast or forget to mention the page.

327
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,720
So, where are we now?

328
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:38,641
So he's holding on to the lightning rod, and he said, when he says all that, he's defying the gods.

329
00:30:39,601 --> 00:30:48,321
He wants to provoke God into striking him down with the lightning or striking him down for spitting in the holy water.

330
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,440
And why?

331
00:30:49,760 --> 00:31:17,521
Well, because one, that will show that there was some meaning in the universe, namely that by some ultimate standard he had done something absolutely unacceptable, and that Ahab was important, that the universe wasn't just totally blank and meaningless, that the fact that there was some meaning gave him a meaning, namely, he was being responded to because what he did was important.

332
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:27,441
And now, all this turns, I think, around how you read his encounter with Moby Gate.

333
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:42,240
I think I can make sense of this in a way that nothing I've seen about this makes sense of it if you understand how he experienced the losing his leg.

334
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:52,040
So, way back on 177, you've got to have some careful reading, but it's not all that subtle.

335
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:53,720
Really, it knocks you in the face.

336
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,921
But let's read it.

337
00:31:51,601 --> 00:31:56,681
At the top of 177.

338
00:31:57,481 --> 00:32:07,801
And then it was, this is Ahab was going after the Moby Dick, and they were close to the whale.

339
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:23,801
And then it was that suddenly, sweeping his sickle-shaped jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab's leg as a mower, a blade of grass in the field.

340
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:31,240
No turban Turk, no hired Venetian or Malay could have smote him with more seeming malice.

341
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:37,720
Now, I think it's very important and interesting to ask yourself: is there something odd about those two sentences?

342
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,801
You figure it out.

343
00:32:39,961 --> 00:32:43,880
Surprise to the first person who sees that there's something wrong with those chairs.

344
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:49,720
They capture how it looks to Ahab, and it's a contradiction.

345
00:32:49,961 --> 00:32:51,961
See the contradiction?

346
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,521
How does the mower relate to a blade of grass in the field?

347
00:32:56,521 --> 00:32:59,880
There couldn't be a more indifferent relationship.

348
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,040
The mower isn't interested in the blade of grass.

349
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:06,041
The mower doesn't even know he's cutting down this particular blade of grass.

350
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:12,361
There is nothing vindictive in any relation.

351
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,560
So look at that.

352
00:33:13,561 --> 00:33:23,321
He takes away his leg like a mower of blade of grass in the field, and then no turban Turk could have smote him with more seeming malice.

353
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:28,441
Now, do you think the mower has malice for the great blade of grass?

354
00:33:28,441 --> 00:33:47,041
I think what you're supposed to see there is that Ahab doesn't know whether the meaning, the universe is completely meaningless, and the whole thing that happened to him with Moby Dick and his leg has no sense like a mower with a blade of grass.

355
00:33:47,041 --> 00:34:01,601
But he wants it to be a confrontation with Moby Dick in which he gets to experience Moby Dick representing the universe and God for him that it's malevolent and that it's directed at him.

356
00:34:01,601 --> 00:34:03,681
That's how he interprets it.

357
00:34:03,681 --> 00:34:06,481
But it's a crazy interpretation.

358
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:16,800
And it's, and that's why, I think, and I think there are texts that support it, but I have to wait till the chase of Moby Dick.

359
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:25,841
But why he's chasing Moby Dick is to settle once and for all which of those two incompatible sentences is right.

360
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:37,441
Once, if he could only confront Moby Dick again, he'd find out whether Moby Dick and the universe were completely indifferent to him and what happened to him made no sense.

361
00:34:37,441 --> 00:34:48,401
Or he could have an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation with Moby Dick, get recognized by Moby Dick, and Moby Dick could go after him definitely, maliciously, and so forth.

362
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,480
That would be fine for Ahab.

363
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:54,800
That would be a solid answer, like getting your finger pinched in the vice.

364
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,840
It may be an answer that hurts, but it doesn't matter.

365
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,441
It's an answer.

366
00:34:59,441 --> 00:35:05,041
And he hasn't got an answer from this first encounter.

367
00:35:06,641 --> 00:35:16,641
But it says, Going, Small reason was there to doubt then that ever since that almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale.

368
00:35:16,641 --> 00:35:18,400
And that it's hard to understand.

369
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,920
I mean, if it's if he cut in, if he swallowed the leg in this blade of grassway, it would be fine.

370
00:35:25,161 --> 00:35:27,560
I mean, it would make sense if he did it with malice.

371
00:35:28,121 --> 00:35:29,720
And I don't think Ahab knows.

372
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:37,720
But he has a wild vindictiveness against the whale all the more fell for him in his all the more what?

373
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:37,960
What?

374
00:35:37,961 --> 00:35:38,521
What?

375
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,240
I'll try reading it again.

376
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:52,521
Small reason was there to doubt then that ever since that almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale.

377
00:35:52,521 --> 00:35:57,641
All the more fell for him in his frantic morbidness.

378
00:35:57,641 --> 00:36:01,481
He at last came to am I reading it right?

379
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,481
I can't, does it make sense?

380
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:05,240
Am I got the grammar?

381
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,400
All the more fell for him that oh, fell, is there such a word?

382
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,921
I mean, such an adjective.

383
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,400
Okay, wow, got a big vocabulary there.

384
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,481
All the more fell for him in his frantic mindedness.

385
00:36:17,481 --> 00:36:28,920
He at last came to identify with him not only all his bodily woes, but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations, namely not getting an answer about the universe.

386
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:38,361
The white whale swam before him as the monomaniac back again, incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating them.

387
00:36:38,521 --> 00:36:40,280
See, it's getting more and more murky.

388
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,240
I mean, he's blaming Obi-Dick for going after him.

389
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,401
He's describing it as if it was vindictive.

390
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:57,801
And now he's thinking that the whale is sort of the center of all that makes him unhappy.

391
00:36:58,121 --> 00:36:59,481
I'll go on.

392
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,760
The last part of that paragraph.

393
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:08,320
All that most maddens and torments, all that stirs up the leaves of things, all truth with malice in it.

394
00:37:06,521 --> 00:37:08,880
We're back to that.

395
00:37:09,121 --> 00:37:22,001
All that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain, all the subtle demonisms of life and thought, all evil to crazy Ahab were visibly personified and made practically assailable in Moby Dick.

396
00:37:22,001 --> 00:37:34,961
He piled upon the whale's white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down, and then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his heart's shell upon it.

397
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,761
More marvelous Melville prose.

398
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:50,880
What seems to be going on is he projects onto Moby Dick all the meaning and malice of the universe, and at least it's an answer.

399
00:37:50,880 --> 00:38:03,441
I mean, if it were, if he could be sure that Moby Dick was malevolent and after him, that would be, he would have a goal in life, so to speak.

400
00:38:03,441 --> 00:38:06,480
He could go and fight Moby Dick.

401
00:38:06,481 --> 00:38:13,681
And he does have a goal in life, but, and this is what I'm trying to say, but I see you all looking puzzled, but I can't do it any more clearly.

402
00:38:13,681 --> 00:38:14,961
Maybe you can.

403
00:38:14,961 --> 00:38:34,001
His goal really is to make sure whether what happened with Moby Dick and his leg was sheer meaningless accident or was proof that there was a meaning and he was the center of the universe and it was after him and so forth.

404
00:38:34,001 --> 00:38:41,681
And the reason I say this is that when he explains what he's doing to Starbuck, I have to find that now.

405
00:38:41,681 --> 00:38:43,041
Let's see.

406
00:38:43,041 --> 00:38:49,440
Since he can't stand uncertainty of I I keep getting going around in circles about that quote I think.

407
00:38:49,441 --> 00:38:51,720
Ah, I'm looking at the wrong page.

408
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,200
So, 118.

409
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:55,720
Is that it?

410
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:56,840
I want to strike through the mask.

411
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,521
Is that 157?

412
00:38:58,521 --> 00:38:59,560
Okay, good.

413
00:39:00,601 --> 00:39:03,161
Let's find it.

414
00:39:03,161 --> 00:39:06,841
Because it isn't as if he knows already what.

415
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,040
Yeah, okay, that's it.

416
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:08,921
Thanks.

417
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,320
First, let's say what Starbucks says is important.

418
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,240
But let me get up to this.

419
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:21,401
So he says to, I want to just make sure that I read what leads up to this.

420
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,521
Okay, there.

421
00:39:22,521 --> 00:39:24,360
The gods have hidden themselves.

422
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,681
He holds onto the lightning rod.

423
00:39:28,521 --> 00:39:30,040
And that's his first encounter.

424
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:31,161
I just read it.

425
00:39:31,161 --> 00:39:33,880
And now Starbucks' view, 157.

426
00:39:34,681 --> 00:39:38,840
Starbuck takes the view of the, you know, the mower and the blade of grass.

427
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:44,041
Vengeance on a dumb brute, cried Starbuck, that simply smoked thee from blindest instinct.

428
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:49,161
Madness to be enraged with a dumb thing, Captain Ahab, seems blasphemous.

429
00:39:49,161 --> 00:39:58,281
Okay, now does Ahab say, I know that he did it out of malice, and then in other words, believe the second sentence?

430
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,921
Or does he really reveal that he doesn't know which?

431
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,200
And he has to go find Moby Dick again and settle this.

432
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,881
And that's what he says, in effect.

433
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,520
Hark ye again, a little lower layer.

434
00:40:10,521 --> 00:40:13,961
All visible objects, man, are but postcard masks.

435
00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:24,361
But in each event, in the living act, the undoubted deed, there's some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the molding of its features from behind the unreasoning mask.

436
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,920
If man will strike, strike through the mask.

437
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:32,281
This is what he's trying to do when he gets his harpoon to Moby Dick, if he ever does.

438
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,800
How can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall?

439
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,281
To me, the white whale is that wall, shoved near to me.

440
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,681
Sometimes I think there's naught beyond.

441
00:40:41,681 --> 00:40:47,601
You see, he hasn't really settled the question whether Moby Dick has any mind at all.

442
00:40:47,601 --> 00:40:48,560
That tis enough.

443
00:40:48,561 --> 00:40:50,400
He tasks me, he heaps me.

444
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,761
I see in him outrageous strength with an inscrutable malice sinewing it.

445
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,641
The inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate.

446
00:40:58,641 --> 00:41:00,961
And that's everything's in there.

447
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:06,481
That he thinks that he sometimes he thinks that it's not malicious at all.

448
00:41:06,481 --> 00:41:08,161
It's just a dumb brute.

449
00:41:08,161 --> 00:41:12,961
Sometimes he thinks that it's malicious.

450
00:41:14,161 --> 00:41:16,160
He hasn't settled the question.

451
00:41:16,161 --> 00:41:19,760
So he has to chase Moby Dick around the world, as he says later.

452
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,800
Literally, he does, around South America, into the Pacific, from Nantucket, to settle the question.

453
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,881
Yeah, go ahead.

454
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,601
I think I agree with you, but I have trouble hearing you.

455
00:41:29,601 --> 00:41:31,041
Just say it again.

456
00:41:31,041 --> 00:41:33,121
What's the malice, according to you?

457
00:41:33,121 --> 00:41:34,080
Okay, good.

458
00:41:34,081 --> 00:41:35,921
Ah, that's exactly right.

459
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,641
Yes, there's a place, I have to find it right away now because you just said it.

460
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,280
There's a place where he talks about something like demonic indifference.

461
00:41:47,280 --> 00:42:04,801
I mean, it could be, and I'll find it in the course of going through here, I think, that the most malicious thing that Moby Dick could do is to take off his leg in a way that doesn't make any sense and doesn't take him as serious as a person, but just does it accidentally.

462
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:12,240
That very way of treating him is for him a kind of maliciousness.

463
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,081
That's one way to read it.

464
00:42:14,081 --> 00:42:18,800
Because Moby Dick did this thing to him, which is the worst thing you could possibly do to him.

465
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,681
Ignore him and take off his leg without even noticing it.

466
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,921
And that's somehow it's so confusing.

467
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:27,881
How could he do that on purpose?

468
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,481
But it's as if he maliciously ignored him.

469
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,120
And that's there are lines like that.

470
00:42:34,121 --> 00:42:36,760
That seems to be what drives him crazy.

471
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,240
Yeah.

472
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,321
Well, kill it is too simple.

473
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:45,481
I mean, he wants to strike through the mask.

474
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,960
I mean, killing it just means killing it.

475
00:42:47,961 --> 00:43:08,361
No, he somehow wants to find out whether Moby Dick is, who stands a member for the universe, has some meaning, has some goal, which is the source of all the evil and suffering in the world, and moreover, has something in for him, Ahab.

476
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,641
So that's more than just killing it.

477
00:43:11,641 --> 00:43:22,200
That's somehow, he wants somehow an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation with Moby Dick in which it will be clear whether Moby Dick is after him or not.

478
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:28,200
And that's what he's been, and he literally has pursued Moby Dick around the world to get that.

479
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:37,320
And what I don't want to tell you, because I want you to read it for yourself, because it's so fantastic, what he finally gets when he gets to Moby Dick.

480
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:37,961
Yeah.

481
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,161
Yeah.

482
00:43:39,481 --> 00:43:40,040
That's right.

483
00:43:40,041 --> 00:43:41,240
And he spent.

484
00:43:41,561 --> 00:43:42,121
That's right.

485
00:43:42,121 --> 00:43:43,800
And he just can't stand it.

486
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:46,921
Yes.

487
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,441
Okay, good.

488
00:43:49,081 --> 00:43:49,800
That's right.

489
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,520
That's right.

490
00:43:50,521 --> 00:43:51,080
That's good.

491
00:43:51,081 --> 00:43:51,641
That's right.

492
00:43:51,641 --> 00:43:54,760
I wonder if Melville, no, Auguste, he couldn't have known this.

493
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,441
He had to figure it out on his own.

494
00:43:56,441 --> 00:43:58,121
How many have read Notes from Underground?

495
00:43:58,121 --> 00:43:59,240
People do often.

496
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:16,801
Well, it's the kind, except that this guy, it's interesting, those of you who have read it, I mean, Ahab is like the guy at Notes from Underground, only with a lot more sort of energy and directedness and so forth, because the Notes from Underground guy just sort of broods about it.

497
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,081
But Ahab goes out and chases Moby Dick all over them.

498
00:44:20,081 --> 00:44:23,601
It's as if the guy goes out to try to kill the guy who bumped into him.

499
00:44:23,601 --> 00:44:25,360
And it is what happened here.

500
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:37,041
But the basic insult that he bumped into him without even noticing looks like exactly what it is to cut off the leg without it noticing like a mower the grass in the field.

501
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:47,200
And that is, I agree with both of you, the most infuriating thing is the indifference, the seeming indifference.

502
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:58,561
And that's why he spits in the calabash, and that's why he holds onto the lightning rod, and that's why he pursues Moby Dick around the world, because he can't stand this indifference.

503
00:44:58,561 --> 00:45:01,360
He wants to settle it with Moby Dick.

504
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,841
Okay, let me go back to where we are.

505
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:16,320
So we got the response, 0157, to Starbuck saying, no, we've got to figure out what the universe is really about, and we've got to do it by confronting Moby Dick.

506
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:22,961
And he hates it and he thinks that it must be malicious, and that's all we got there.

507
00:45:24,961 --> 00:45:28,001
We've got to force an answer from the universe.

508
00:45:28,641 --> 00:45:31,520
And there must be one total meaning.

509
00:45:31,521 --> 00:45:34,801
That's the monomania of him.

510
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:46,400
And of course, just on the side, it makes Ahab miss all the meaning that there is, this monomaniac quits from Moby Dick.

511
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:57,080
There is a place, I won't try to turn to it now, where Ahab is thinking of his wife and going home to domestic satisfaction back in Nantucket.

512
00:45:57,081 --> 00:46:00,601
Just before he left, he married a young woman, as I recall.

513
00:46:00,601 --> 00:46:03,000
I haven't looked back at that part, but I see now.

514
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:14,760
But he can't enjoy that kind of human meaning and satisfaction because he's got this monomaniac thing about Moby Dick.

515
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:30,121
As soon as he starts thinking about his wife, the farcy double that he has, I can't tell you more about, but he comes back at the end of the book too, comes by, and he sees the shadow in the water, and he stops thinking about the wife.

516
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:37,161
It's just, I mean, it's, it's, once you get in this kind of obsession, nothing else matters to you.

517
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:39,240
Every bit of meaning is gone.

518
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:55,561
I mean, this is again the sort of essence of monotheism, according to Melville, is a kind of monomania which focuses on the total meaning of everything and loses the meaning of anything specific.

519
00:46:55,561 --> 00:46:58,761
I can explain that in just a second, which I will.

520
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,840
But just for it first.

521
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:06,281
And it's interesting, just I'd say here to relate Ahab to Balkington.

522
00:47:07,161 --> 00:47:11,081
Ahab is really sort of the absolute opposite of Baltington.

523
00:47:11,081 --> 00:47:13,240
Starbuck is just not on their dimension.

524
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:22,200
He's happily accepting his Christian monotheism about the universe, but he's a pious believing Christian.

525
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:29,161
Balkington was this kind of demigod because he totally accepted meaninglessness.

526
00:47:29,481 --> 00:47:36,881
And Ahab has this kind of godlike quality because he totally refuses to accept meaninglessness.

527
00:47:36,441 --> 00:47:42,400
And Ishmael, and that's now another aspect of it.

528
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,320
What does Ishmael think about this?

529
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:58,161
This is as far from Ishmael's way of life as you could get, both the Balkington story and the Balking story and what.

530
00:47:58,481 --> 00:48:02,720
And I guess Ahab's quest are the two.

531
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:08,161
I mean, they are, so Balking accepts meaninglessness, and Ahab can't accept it.

532
00:48:08,161 --> 00:48:09,761
I think that's what I was trying to say.

533
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:20,961
But what I want to say now is that Ishmael is so, and this is so interesting and important, able to get into any mood, even a mood as far from him as you could get.

534
00:48:20,961 --> 00:48:34,400
Because after all, I mean, this Ahab obsessing to find the one answer to forgetting every other little bit of meaning and sacredness and comfort and everything in the world for that couldn't be further than Ishmael.

535
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:40,240
And yet, on 171, chapter 41, he gets into the mood of Ahab.

536
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:54,320
When Ahab does his thing and puts the harpoon in the blood and makes the harpooners all swear to go after Moby Dick, that chapter 41, I, Ishmael, was one with that crew.

537
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,401
My shouts had gone up with the rest.

538
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,200
My oath had been welded with theirs.

539
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:06,001
And stronger I shouted, and more did I hammer and clinch my oath because of the dread in my soul.

540
00:49:06,001 --> 00:49:10,081
A wild, mystical, sympathetic feeling was in me.

541
00:49:10,081 --> 00:49:14,240
Ahab's quenchless feud-themed mine.

542
00:49:14,561 --> 00:49:20,880
With greedy ears, I learned the history of that murderous monster against whom I and all the others had taken our oath of violence and revenge.

543
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,121
The crucial thing is, he has a sympathetical feeling.

544
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:26,520
He gets even into the Ahab mood.

545
00:49:26,681 --> 00:49:29,641
He's able to get into every mood.

546
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:41,880
And there is also a place where I think, but I couldn't find the quote that he talks about Ahab's tragic greatness.

547
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:54,841
If anybody finds that as you read along, try to remember and tell it to me, because I think that's his being on Ahab's side, so to speak, sometimes.

548
00:49:55,961 --> 00:49:58,920
Okay, now it's time to stop because that's for Ahab.

549
00:49:59,001 --> 00:50:06,200
I mean, I'm ready to go on, but first we have to see whether anybody wants to say anything about Ahab.

550
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:06,841
Yeah.

551
00:50:09,081 --> 00:50:10,361
Serious what?

552
00:50:10,681 --> 00:50:15,081
Yes, he has all these weird people inside his head.

553
00:50:15,081 --> 00:50:16,921
In Starbucks' head.

554
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:20,041
No, Starbucks is just a strange, not a strange.

555
00:50:20,121 --> 00:50:25,801
He's perfectly normal, boring, pious Christian.

556
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,161
Yes, yes, that's right.

557
00:50:27,161 --> 00:50:35,640
But he never gets him to appreciate him the way Melville appreciates him.

558
00:50:36,041 --> 00:50:39,641
What Starbucks says, I happen to know that little piece by heart.

559
00:50:39,641 --> 00:50:41,480
My soul is more than matched.

560
00:50:41,481 --> 00:50:48,521
She's over-manned and by a madman, insufferable sporing that I should ground sanity in such a field or something like that.

561
00:50:48,521 --> 00:50:56,681
Starbuck admits that he was not converted by Ahab, it's simply sort of overwhelmed by Ahab.

562
00:50:56,681 --> 00:51:13,681
And he, Starbuck, is criticized by Ishmael for not having killed Ahab, who's endangering the whole crew, but he's just, I can remember the quote too: something like: he's weakened by his Christian piety, or something like that.

563
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:19,200
That keeps him from being able to shoot Ahab, which he almost does, but just can't bring himself to do.

564
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:19,600
Yeah.

565
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,081
I'll say that again.

566
00:51:22,081 --> 00:51:23,841
Again, I have to come up so I can hear you.

567
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:24,561
Yes.

568
00:51:24,641 --> 00:51:26,161
The whale just manifests itself as.

569
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:26,880
That's right.

570
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,840
He would, that's right.

571
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:40,961
The whale is the sort of focus because he can't stand the indifference, both because he wants a final meaning and because he doesn't want to be just nobody.

572
00:51:40,961 --> 00:51:47,200
He wants to be recognized as sort of the confrontation between him and the source of the final meaning.

573
00:51:47,200 --> 00:52:00,641
So his monomania consists both in insisting on having a final meaning, triple thing, also insisting on being recognized by the universe as important and putting all that on Moby Dick.

574
00:52:00,641 --> 00:52:18,401
I mean, those three things are all part of the monomania and all come out of the way his leg was cut off, which was, I think, supposed to be, I mean, we're told, cut off with complete indifference, like a mower cutting down a blade of grass in the field.

575
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,481
That's what happened.

576
00:52:20,481 --> 00:52:25,361
And all the rest of it is his crazy projection onto what happened.

577
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,520
I mean, that's how I read those two sentences.

578
00:52:27,521 --> 00:52:29,200
The first sentence is a fact.

579
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:33,280
Moby Dick cut off his leg the way a mower cuts down a blade of grass in the field.

580
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,401
He's a dumb brute, the way Starbuck says.

581
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,281
And the second sentence is how it seemed to Ahab.

582
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,081
Nothing could be more malicious.

583
00:52:42,081 --> 00:53:04,841
And then we've got his point: that, and you can either say malicious because it really, really aimed at Ahab and thought Ahab was important and hated Ahab and was going to hurt him, or malicious because it made it clear, completely clear to Ahab, that nobody cared about Ahab and that Moby Dick was completely indifferent to Ahab.

584
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,560
Either one is outrageous for Ahab.

585
00:53:07,561 --> 00:53:12,121
That the universe is out to get him is outrageous, but he would like that.

586
00:53:12,121 --> 00:53:17,561
That the universe isn't out to get him, you'd think that would be comforting, but that makes him even more unhappy.

587
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:21,001
This is what I mean by this being complicated.

588
00:53:21,001 --> 00:53:22,440
I guess it's not confused.

589
00:53:22,441 --> 00:53:25,481
Every once in a while, I think I can state it clearly.

590
00:53:25,481 --> 00:53:37,321
I mean, that's the two things on Ahab's mind that get sort of intertwined all the time: the meaning of the universe and his importance, his place in it.

591
00:53:37,641 --> 00:53:40,681
And it all gets heaped up on Moby Dick.

592
00:53:40,681 --> 00:53:43,561
And period.

593
00:53:43,561 --> 00:53:44,841
I'm going to go on.

594
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,481
Okay?

595
00:53:46,521 --> 00:53:50,520
The next thing I want to talk about, and it'll take talking next time too.

596
00:53:50,840 --> 00:54:01,801
So now, I have to switch completely and talk about things that I could talk about without going into the exciting ending events.

597
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:11,240
And the general topic is: where can you find meaning in a sort of random, meaningless world?

598
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:17,081
Random in that it was just the coral insects wandering around that made these orbs.

599
00:54:17,081 --> 00:54:19,480
And the weaving has no plan.

600
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,801
There's nothing specific being woven.

601
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:32,681
And yet, and of course, Valkington sees that this, thinks this is just sheer meaningless.

602
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:39,760
And it certainly is sort of indefinite and indeterminate.

603
00:54:40,081 --> 00:54:43,441
But can't you somehow find meaning anyway?

604
00:54:43,441 --> 00:54:57,361
That's the interesting question, because Ishmael is clearly not a fan of Balkington's and not a fan of Ahab most of the time trying to make sure you get a meaning.

605
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:04,560
So here goes three different ways that you can get meaning in your life and in your world according to the way Ishmael has set it up.

606
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,961
One of them is what I'm calling the pagan.

607
00:55:08,961 --> 00:55:28,480
That is, there's something about those civilizations, if you can call them that, those societies or something, that have been totally uncorrupted by monotheism, by the whole idea that there should be one unified answer for everybody.

608
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:40,161
They can have a culture in which you can lead a totally sublime, meaningful life and die perfectly, contentedly.

609
00:55:40,161 --> 00:55:42,321
And this all happens on 460.

610
00:55:42,561 --> 00:56:09,840
The pagan person who lives in a sort of constant sacred mood, or I don't think it's one mood, who is attuned to the sacred in his way, which doesn't mean that it has to be one mood, I think, but it has to be something that he's got from his pagan religion.

611
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,921
This is on 460.

612
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,161
This is when Quequeg is dying, the middle of the page.

613
00:56:16,161 --> 00:56:23,560
How he wasted and wasted away in those few long lingering days, till there seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing.

614
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:31,401
But as all else in him thinned and his cheekbones grew sharper, his eyes nevertheless seemed glowing fuller and fuller.

615
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:45,481
They became of a strange softness of luster, and mildly but deeply looking out at you there from his sickness, a wondrous testimony to the immortal health in him, which could not die or be weakened.

616
00:56:45,481 --> 00:56:55,401
So he's got some kind of spiritual health, and he's a model of how to die and how to live.

617
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:13,001
Skipping down in the sort of about 15 lines from the bottom: no dying Chaldee or Greek had higher and holier thoughts than those whose mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor Quequeg as he quietly lay in his swaying handle.

618
00:57:13,001 --> 00:57:17,801
So there's something absolutely holy about his life.

619
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:18,520
Healed.

620
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:34,121
If anybody's healed of the sickness that seems to be almost universal, according to Melville, I don't know whether he thinks everybody's cracked about the head or everybody but virtuous pagans.

621
00:57:34,121 --> 00:57:40,281
I think maybe he thinks everybody is, but the pagans managed to find a life in which you can heal.

622
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,441
He's holy, he's healed.

623
00:57:42,441 --> 00:57:59,240
And that's because he's saved from non-total from totalizing religion so that he can see the sacred power of the various things in his religion.

624
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:03,641
And there are several features of Quequeg now that are very important.

625
00:58:05,001 --> 00:58:12,400
This is Melville, one of Melville's attempts to show sort of what the ideal way to live in this meaningless universe is.

626
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:18,001
So, one, Kwequeg doesn't try to put his religion and his gods off on others.

627
00:58:18,001 --> 00:58:23,360
That happens only if it all happens at all, because he gets corrupted by Christianity.

628
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:28,800
And even then, I don't think you see him ever trying to even get Ishmael to worship Yo-Yo.

629
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,041
That's Ishmael's idea.

630
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:32,961
And now comes a new element.

631
00:58:32,961 --> 00:58:45,041
Kwequeg understands in a funny way, not an intellectual understanding, something about the sacredness of his own background practices.

632
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:54,961
There is that he's got an understanding of being, but a plural understanding of being, not a mono-one.

633
00:58:56,641 --> 00:59:03,921
He was just socialized and raised up in a culture that has that, and he understands that that's sacred.

634
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,440
So, how do we see that?

635
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:06,880
Well, very peculiar.

636
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:13,281
When he's dying and he's in his coffin, he copies out the markings on his body.

637
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:18,321
This is Melville at his best, I think, because at least I can understand him.

638
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,321
And yet he's saying weird, far-out things.

639
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:39,521
At the 464 with the first full paragraph, with a wild, whimsic whimsiness, he now used his coffin, this is Kwequeg, for a sea chest and emptied into it his canvas bag of clothes and set them in order.

640
00:59:39,521 --> 00:59:41,040
And now comes the part for us.

641
00:59:41,041 --> 00:59:48,481
More spare hours he spent in carving the lid of all, carving the lid with all manner of grotesque figures and drawings.

642
00:59:48,481 --> 00:59:55,161
And it seems that thereby he was striving in his rude way to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on his body.

643
00:59:55,161 --> 00:59:57,481
Now, that's very interesting.

644
00:59:57,481 --> 01:00:00,840
By the way, the coffin turns out to be very important and what's carved on it.

645
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:04,281
I can't tell you more about why for a while.

646
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:20,521
And this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth.

647
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:30,121
So in his body, he contains, so to speak, an understanding of the universe.

648
01:00:30,121 --> 01:00:34,121
Now, I think it's a big mistake to say a complete theory of the heavens.

649
01:00:34,121 --> 01:00:37,081
That's too scientific and too modern.

650
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,081
Melville just slips up there.

651
01:00:39,081 --> 01:00:40,040
He doesn't believe.

652
01:00:40,041 --> 01:00:44,200
He says explicitly that he doesn't believe there's any complete theory of anything.

653
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,161
And that's right.

654
01:00:45,161 --> 01:00:47,880
That's his view about science and everything else.

655
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,561
I don't know how he could do that.

656
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:57,481
But it is something like an understanding of the universe and our place in it.

657
01:00:57,481 --> 01:01:04,041
That's the theory, that's what he has of the heaven and the earth and the art of attaining truth.

658
01:01:04,041 --> 01:01:17,321
He's got all that carved on his body, but so that Kleeque in his own proper person was a riddle to behold, a wondrous work in one volume, but whose mysteries not even himself could read.

659
01:01:17,641 --> 01:01:19,641
Now, what does that mean?

660
01:01:19,641 --> 01:01:20,681
That's very weird.

661
01:01:20,681 --> 01:01:23,001
What is Melville talking about?

662
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:39,601
And the answer is: we are all that, each of us have in our body an understanding of being that we get from our culture, which is in a certain way sacred because it thanks to it, anything shows up as anything.

663
01:01:39,601 --> 01:01:43,361
And anything makes whatever makes sense to do makes sense to do.

664
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:48,881
I think I gave you examples last time, but I'll talk about it again a little.

665
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:58,961
We all stand a certain distance from each other in this culture, and that's related to how much whom we put our arms around, and that's related to what intimacy amounts to.

666
01:01:59,521 --> 01:02:01,361
And I made another one here.

667
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:09,521
It's in the culture where women are submissive, then there's a whole understanding of their role in the world.

668
01:02:09,521 --> 01:02:26,401
Then they don't have to think about it, they don't have to notice it, they won't think about it, they don't notice it, but they stand stooped over, they don't look people in the eye, they speak quietly, they follow behind their husband, they don't interrupt the men when they're talking seriously, and so forth.

669
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,960
That's the truth about women in the culture.

670
01:02:28,961 --> 01:02:29,760
That's what it means.

671
01:02:30,001 --> 01:02:41,041
And in those women, that truth is carved onto their bodies, and they don't understand it, they don't see it, they can't read it.

672
01:02:41,601 --> 01:02:45,761
That's exactly what Melville has gotten to here.

673
01:02:46,001 --> 01:02:47,601
He may be the first one to say this.

674
01:02:47,601 --> 01:02:50,240
Philosophers have never, never noticed that.

675
01:02:50,561 --> 01:02:53,520
Yeats noticed it, poets noticed it.

676
01:02:53,760 --> 01:03:02,961
I've got a thing in my office, a poster, where Yeats, in the last letter he wrote, says, We can embody the truth, but we cannot know it.

677
01:03:02,961 --> 01:03:05,760
That's exactly what's happening with Quiqued.

678
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:13,840
He embodies the truth of his culture, and he understands, he lives that truth, but he can't think that truth.

679
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:18,401
He can't understand what's carved into his body.

680
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,720
And Ahab at the end is wonderful.

681
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:26,040
I said I would give you another quote about how Ahab can't stand uncertainty.

682
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:35,321
And this thought, namely that he can't understand it, and it will remain unsolved to the last.

683
01:03:35,641 --> 01:03:48,601
This thought it must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild exclamation of his when one morning turning away from surveying poor Queque, oh devilish tantalization of the gods.

684
01:03:48,601 --> 01:03:50,841
And see, that adds a whole element.

685
01:03:50,840 --> 01:04:02,601
I mean, it's all very well to have the meaning of being in your culture carved into your body, and it's sacred, and you go to put it in your coffin and die happily with it.

686
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,080
But Ahab can't stand that.

687
01:04:05,081 --> 01:04:17,001
He wants, it tantalizes him to read the hieroglyphics, to have the theory, to state the truth that's carved into Quequeg's body, and presumably the one that's in his body too.

688
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:25,401
Ahab sees it as this unacceptable uncertainty, something like that.

689
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:31,161
For him, it's got to be explicit, and if he can't read it, then he can't stand it.

690
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,041
And that's just typical Ahab.

691
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:42,681
So, and that's, and it's saving power of these sacred practices that are in the body of Quequeg.

692
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:45,240
It doesn't require that he understand it.

693
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,800
In fact, I think it would be lost if you understand it.

694
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:53,160
Picture the women in that culture who have all this built into them that they are submissive.

695
01:04:53,160 --> 01:05:06,561
It would be the first stage of feminine rebellion and consciousness raising and breaking out of it if they saw that they had been socialized into it.

696
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,681
And they would lose that understanding of being.

697
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:11,280
And in a way, of course, that would be a good thing.

698
01:05:11,441 --> 01:05:14,240
Not all understandings of being are as good as any other.

699
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:20,160
From our point of view, they could become women like women are in this culture.

700
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:24,880
From maybe from their point of view, women in this culture have lost their essential femininity.

701
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,800
We shouldn't get lost into those issues.

702
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:36,880
The important thing is that it doesn't have to be made explicit, but Ahab can't stand it unless it's made explicit.

703
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:39,840
Ahab can't stand.

704
01:05:40,401 --> 01:05:43,040
Remember, it's unrepresentable.

705
01:05:43,201 --> 01:05:47,280
The tattoos should remind you of the hieroglyphics on Moby Dick.

706
01:05:47,281 --> 01:05:54,320
Hieroglyphics are signs that mean something, but we can't tell what in Moby Dick, in the book.

707
01:05:54,321 --> 01:06:02,800
And what Ahab can't stand is the unrepresentable and the ungraspable and the uncertain.

708
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:07,440
So he can't stand the Kwequeg squiggles.

709
01:06:08,401 --> 01:06:13,361
Now, I'll begin the next one because I don't want to.

710
01:06:13,521 --> 01:06:15,920
Well, no, now I, I mean, you want to say anything about that?

711
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:23,200
That's a fascinating little riff there that it seems completely out of place.

712
01:06:23,201 --> 01:06:37,120
But when the time comes, remember that there's a, like, on Kweequeg's coffin is carved the saving meaning in the practices of the culture.

713
01:06:37,441 --> 01:06:41,280
And that will turn out to be interesting and important.

714
01:06:41,281 --> 01:06:44,800
Well, now let me, I'll start the next because I want you to be sure and read it.

715
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,080
Yeah, go ahead.

716
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:48,481
Oh, and you put it a little too weakly.

717
01:06:48,481 --> 01:06:53,080
You can have meaning with an adult without knowing it at all.

718
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,920
In fact, knowing it would undermine it.

719
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:58,681
I mean, one, luckily, you can't, you were never going to be able to know it.

720
01:06:58,681 --> 01:06:59,960
It's unrepresentable.

721
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:12,681
If you could know it, if you could have a science of proxemics, which I think I mentioned once, which had the whole theory of distance standing in our culture, I think you'd probably get so inhibited about distance standing you wouldn't be able to do it anymore.

722
01:07:14,361 --> 01:07:18,760
All these practices only work when you don't think about them.

723
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:24,521
It's like trying to think about while you're riding a bicycle how you do it or dance or how you do it.

724
01:07:24,521 --> 01:07:34,200
So being in your culture, standing your way and looking people in the eye your way and so forth is something you can only do when you don't represent it.

725
01:07:34,201 --> 01:07:36,441
And that's good though to make that point.

726
01:07:36,681 --> 01:07:40,760
It's not just, however you put it, sort of better if you don't understand it.

727
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:54,441
I think it's one understand, it's one, it's not representable and understandable, and two, it's a very important and positive thing that you can't understand it, according to Melville, and according to me, and Heidegger, at least and Nietzsche, I think.

728
01:07:54,840 --> 01:08:00,040
Okay, let me just set up the next thing because I want you to have it to read.

729
01:08:00,361 --> 01:08:06,440
The second kind of meaning, this is all sort of pure pagan meanings.

730
01:08:06,441 --> 01:08:17,240
And now, a meaning which we still have, by the way, but which we are sort of lost a sense of the sacred of it.

731
01:08:17,241 --> 01:08:21,400
And in a way, I think, could we be losing our practices?

732
01:08:21,401 --> 01:08:22,681
Hmm.

733
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,320
That's a long story, I think.

734
01:08:27,321 --> 01:08:40,240
But there's something to be said for the fact that in our culture, our practices actually operate so as to try to force us to make everything explicit and understanding.

735
01:08:40,561 --> 01:08:48,400
The latest version is try to get it all so you can represent it on a computer, so that you can make a computer that will behave like a human being.

736
01:08:48,401 --> 01:09:05,760
Well, if a lot of what makes people behave like a human being is the non-representable stuff in their way of dealing with everything, then you'd better be able to make to represent it into the computer so you can have artificial intelligence and make a computer that behaves like people.

737
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:08,320
And people try that.

738
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:10,240
That's proxemics, for instance.

739
01:09:10,241 --> 01:09:15,040
Let's make a computer that has all the theory in it of distance standing, whatever.

740
01:09:15,521 --> 01:09:26,880
And so our practices lead us to try to make them explicit and try to cover up their unrepresentableness.

741
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,240
It's a funny situation.

742
01:09:28,241 --> 01:09:30,720
Heidegger worries about it a lot.

743
01:09:31,361 --> 01:09:34,160
That isn't what you should be thinking about or worrying about.

744
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:34,800
It isn't.

745
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:38,320
But Melville does, in a funny way, worry about it.

746
01:09:38,321 --> 01:09:45,200
He worries about what if they fish out, what if they get rid of all the sperm whales, which are the source of the unrepresentable?

747
01:09:45,201 --> 01:09:46,561
Where will we be then?

748
01:09:47,201 --> 01:09:49,200
And his answer is they can't do it.

749
01:09:49,201 --> 01:09:54,720
The whales will hide under the Arctic ice cap and they won't let that happen.

750
01:09:54,720 --> 01:10:11,521
So there's some hope for Melville that no matter how much the culture tries to get rid of this sacred truth that we all have inscribed in our bodies by making it explicit and thereby putting it in computers, for instance, you can't do it.

751
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:18,160
I wrote a book about that, what computers can't do, and all dealing with this issue.

752
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:25,720
Okay, now I did want to say, and I have one minute, I want you to be sure and read chapter 94.

753
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:28,040
It's very peculiar.

754
01:10:28,361 --> 01:10:34,521
And it's the second way and a very important way of getting meaning in your life.

755
01:10:34,521 --> 01:10:42,040
It's the way Ishmael gets the most powerful, most sacred meaning in his life.

756
01:10:42,201 --> 01:10:45,000
Chapter's called the Squeeze of the Hand.

757
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,641
And you'll talk about it next time.

758
01:10:49,641 --> 01:10:52,920
And let's see what else I want you to look at.

759
01:10:53,241 --> 01:10:54,521
Mainly that.

760
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,240
And that's it for now.
