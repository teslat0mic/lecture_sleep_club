1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
Today, today we can do the background, in a sense, the family story.

2
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:19,240
You'll see that Dostoevsky believes a lot in heredity, that who the parents of the three brothers, or three and a half brothers, are is very important.

3
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:27,160
And you'll see next time that he also believes a lot in childhood experiences being very important.

4
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:29,080
I don't think we'll get to that today.

5
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:36,120
I don't expect to, but I certainly expect to do mostly to talk about the brothers.

6
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:42,360
So you notice, by the way, another reason for you that it's a great novel is they're roughly your age.

7
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:56,600
They're a little older, but they're in their early 20s, and they are having all sorts of problems in a kind of dramatic Russian way that everybody has at their age.

8
00:00:57,561 --> 00:01:00,600
But there is the problem it being a Russian novel.

9
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:09,240
It's so hard to keep track of who's who, because everybody seems to have about five different names, or at least a lot of the characters do.

10
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:21,800
And I once, after worrying about that and feeling bad about that, and at least giving you a handout last time that was helping you to figure out who's who, I realized that at least there's nothing Russian about it.

11
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,920
If you were reading a novel in which you heard about Mr.

12
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:34,520
Smith, also called William, Bill, Billy, Will, and Willie, you'd know who was it was the same guy with all those names.

13
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,800
One, two, three, four, five, six.

14
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:46,041
And moreover, and this is more important, you not only wouldn't, you'd understand it was the same person, you'd understand a lot about the person.

15
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:52,600
I mean, that Charlie Brown is called Charlie Brown and not Charles Brown is obviously important.

16
00:01:52,920 --> 00:02:01,041
And then when one of the women who loves him calls him Charles, you feel, boy, boy, that's a different, different take on Charlie Brown.

17
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:12,960
But anyway, you will see that the people, who gets called by what sorts of nicknames, it's a very, and is very revealing about what kind of person they are.

18
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:28,720
So, for instance, Dimitri, who's mostly called Mitya, or about half and half called Mitya, is somebody who's more or less half and half on a kind of formal and half and half on an informal relation to people.

19
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,361
And more exciting and interesting examples are Alexei.

20
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,881
That's Salyasha.

21
00:02:34,881 --> 00:02:40,960
But he's almost always called Ariasha because everybody's on friendly terms with him.

22
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,640
And the most interesting to me is Yvonne.

23
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,761
Yvonne has a nickname too, Vanka.

24
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:57,361
And it turns out to be extremely important at a certain point in the book where there's a song about Vanka, which is really about, which Yvonne takes to be about him.

25
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,080
But for years, I had no idea what was going on at that point.

26
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:09,280
And you do, when you're paying attention, see that old Karamatsov calls him Vanka now and then.

27
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,480
But nobody's on familiar terms with Yvonne.

28
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,960
He is distant and aloof with everybody.

29
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:25,361
And Smershikov, who's half a Karamatsov's brother, has no nickname at all, as far as I know, or else that is his nickname.

30
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,761
I don't know what to think about that, except that he's on weird terms with everybody.

31
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:32,961
Okay, so much for that.

32
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,281
But this reminds me of something I was going to say at the beginning, which if I don't say it, I'll forget.

33
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,881
I have to take a kind of poll.

34
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:51,960
When I was talking about the smallness of the book, usually it looks about twice as big when I order it and has a hard cover and looks like it might be the most serious best novel in the world.

35
00:03:51,960 --> 00:04:03,881
I bought this small one, not because it makes much difference in the price, but because I was told that lots of people wanted a small one so they could carry it around in their backpack and read it on every possible occasion.

36
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:08,840
And that obviously moves me much because I want you to read it on every possible occasion.

37
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:17,960
So I just want to know for the next time I give the course, is it a good idea to have a little one like this, which is sort of hard on your eyes but easy to carry around?

38
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,481
Or would you rather have a big one?

39
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,920
How many are glad we've got a little portable one?

40
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:24,761
Oh, I was well informed.

41
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:27,480
How many are sorry we've got a little portable one?

42
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,480
Well, that's overwhelming.

43
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:38,761
Okay, I won't use this one again because I discovered in reading it that they, to make it really small, they left off the epigraph, which I'll tell you what it is when the time comes.

44
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:46,040
And they've left off a little three-page introduction by the supposed author, which turns out not to be important, but you'd think they'd at least publish the whole book.

45
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:52,201
And they've done subtle things with the translation, which makes it more sort of down-to-earth.

46
00:04:52,201 --> 00:04:57,081
But I'm so used to the old one, I can't help feeling that they've lost a little something.

47
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,560
I'll tell you that when that's important, too.

48
00:04:59,881 --> 00:05:02,280
Okay, now back to where we were.

49
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:24,201
So the amazing thing, which I sort of stumbled into when I started teaching this course a long time ago, is that Dostoevsky seems to have exactly Kierkegaard's view of the self, the different factors that go to make up a human being, the different sets of factors.

50
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:34,001
Of course, it's hard to see because Dostoevsky never talks about the self or very, very rarely mentions the self.

51
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:41,681
So, what is his name for whatever it is that has these contradictory sets of factors?

52
00:05:42,561 --> 00:05:43,921
Anybody know?

53
00:05:44,881 --> 00:05:46,960
You could cheat and find out.

54
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,680
I think you have it in your hands in what you just handed out.

55
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,520
So, anyway, it's the heart.

56
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:08,720
You hear Dostoevsky through Dmitry particularly, and we'll talk about it later today, talking about the contradictoriness of the human heart and laying out the factors with Dmitry's names for them.

57
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,361
Everybody's got different names for the factors.

58
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:13,840
Everybody's got different relations to the factors.

59
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,080
Remember, the factors don't have a fixed meaning.

60
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:28,241
It's part of what it is to be a self taking a stand on itself, that the set of factors is taking a stand on how to understand the set of factors that it is.

61
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,400
You wouldn't believe anybody could say anything like that if you hadn't been through reading the definition of the self.

62
00:06:36,881 --> 00:06:45,040
And so you want to know in Dostoevsky, like you want to know in Kierkegaard, so what stand should the self be taking on itself?

63
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,681
How should it relate to itself?

64
00:06:47,681 --> 00:06:57,401
And the answer is: in Dostoevsky, like in Kierkegaard, there's no general moral principles that tell you what to do.

65
00:06:58,201 --> 00:07:12,521
Or what it is, whether you should be living like the Greeks or Plato, dying to the body, or whether you should be living like a materialist, dying to the superstitions about religion and the soul, and so forth.

66
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:17,241
There's no answer to that that you can get from reason or revelation.

67
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:34,921
The only way you can get it, and this makes Dostoevy an existentialist just like Kierkegaard, is by living one of these ways of relating to yourself, being a materialist, or being spiritual, or Platonic, and so forth.

68
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:53,001
And then either you'll see that that's a way of life that leads you to be joyful and maybe even blissful, or you'll see that that's a way of life that leads you to despair in Kierkegaard talk, and Dostoevsky too sometime, or madness, or suffering, anyway.

69
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:56,120
Although suffering, no, I won't think suffering, that's not the right word.

70
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:01,401
Suffering can be a good thing, but despair and madness are not good things.

71
00:08:01,801 --> 00:08:13,561
And you will see, the way Dostoevsky sets it up, that each of the three brothers represents a stance of the cell on what it is to be a cell.

72
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:33,401
And what becomes of them is telling you what it is, which is the best way to be, by showing you what happens to characters, people who take each of these stands on being a human being, these different existential types of human beings.

73
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:50,360
And the right stand is the one that works, and by works means gives you a meaningful and happy life, as opposed to driving you toward, in effect, finally, suicide, as you'll see later on in the book.

74
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,960
And so you keep that in mind.

75
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,880
I see that I say talk here about suffering.

76
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,561
Suffering is a tricky notion.

77
00:08:58,561 --> 00:09:03,601
Dostoevsky thinks suffering, if you do it right, is a good thing.

78
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,161
Here's another word.

79
00:09:06,161 --> 00:09:09,201
Here's another word for the wrong kind of suffering.

80
00:09:09,201 --> 00:09:14,401
And I meant to look it up before I came to see what this translation had done to it.

81
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:19,521
In the translation I'm used to, there's a chapter called Lacerations in the Living Room.

82
00:09:19,521 --> 00:09:21,281
It's still called lacerations.

83
00:09:21,281 --> 00:09:29,441
Well, I don't know a better translation for the word that's called lacerations, but that's a bad kind of suffering that keeps open the wound.

84
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,121
Spell torment or something like that.

85
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,121
Anybody's been reading it in Russian?

86
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,561
I need a Russian consultant.

87
00:09:36,561 --> 00:09:39,201
Every year when I do it, I need a Russian consultant.

88
00:09:39,521 --> 00:09:42,720
I have ideas about how it should be.

89
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:48,561
And I want to know whether I can push the Russian around into saying what I wanted to say.

90
00:09:48,561 --> 00:09:52,641
Okay, well, I know somebody who will tell me about the Russian.

91
00:09:52,641 --> 00:09:54,401
So let's go back to this.

92
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,720
Now.

93
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:07,601
So now we're going to go into what Dostoevsky calls the history of the family.

94
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,281
That's what turns out.

95
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:14,561
So that's the question of their hereditary traits.

96
00:10:14,561 --> 00:10:22,161
And what you have on the chart I gave you last time, I think, though I'm getting mixed up in my own head about, you've got four charts now.

97
00:10:22,161 --> 00:10:24,881
You've got the list of the characters in the book.

98
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,961
You've got the family tree on the back of that.

99
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,960
That's the one I want to talk about.

100
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:36,001
You've got one that's going to come up by the end of today about the self, which I'm going to talk about.

101
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,360
And you've got one pointing way ahead of the Grand Inquisitor that I'm not going to talk about till we'll get there.

102
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:50,921
So hold on to these charts and bring them with you because I don't want to keep writing them on the board because I write them on the board so badly nobody can read them anyway.

103
00:10:50,921 --> 00:10:52,441
I put them all on the website.

104
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:58,121
So if for some reason you haven't got it or you lose it, you can do it again, print it again.

105
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,681
Okay.

106
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:08,921
Now, there are four Caramont songs, really, which is a good thing, because there are really four ways to be a self in Kierkegaard.

107
00:11:08,921 --> 00:11:12,681
And so you need to think about all of them.

108
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:22,601
The first one, which you might not notice, the ones that you can understand, obviously, I won't tell you yet who's who, though you ought to be able to figure it out.

109
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:32,281
There's obviously the one that's trying to get the factors together by themselves, trying to get the factors together by getting rid of one side.

110
00:11:32,921 --> 00:11:34,520
Remember, negative R2.

111
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:43,721
And there's somebody trying to get the factors together by getting both sides, doing justice to both sides of the self by themselves.

112
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,960
That's positive R2.

113
00:11:46,281 --> 00:11:50,840
And then there's the one that relates the factors to each other by relating to another.

114
00:11:51,161 --> 00:11:53,801
And that's what I call positive R3.

115
00:11:54,121 --> 00:12:08,681
But then there's room for a fourth one, which is this unconsciousness of despair, of spirit, of not being aware that you've got a self, of not facing up to the problems of the fact.

116
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:11,561
And who could that be?

117
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:16,840
Old Theodore, somebody said, I hope.

118
00:12:17,161 --> 00:12:18,361
The father.

119
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,761
He's the one who is distracted all the time.

120
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:30,001
So you see on page 19, I'm going to always cite this micro book.

121
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,361
So there it is in page 19.

122
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,801
What happened here?

123
00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:40,321
Oh, oh yeah, it's so much near the top I didn't see it.

124
00:12:40,321 --> 00:12:42,321
About 10 lines down.

125
00:12:42,321 --> 00:12:56,001
It talks about him as someone fairly frequently the kind of person one fairly frequently to be met with, a despicable, vicious man, and at the same time, senseless.

126
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,721
Well, already, I would like to see the Russian.

127
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,201
I am convinced this reading through that that's a bad idea.

128
00:13:03,201 --> 00:13:08,321
I was in a sort of mood to be sort of demanding about the translation.

129
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:12,481
And then, so senseless is, why is senseless bad for old Karamatsov?

130
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:31,601
Well, you sort of know enough already, wherever you are reading, to know maybe that he's smart enough to have made enough good business deals to be rich, and he's smart enough to sort of outmaneuver everybody else and carry on high-level and sort of witty theological debates with Yvonne.

131
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,401
So senseless doesn't seem quite right.

132
00:13:34,401 --> 00:13:42,721
The translation we used last time, the big, big hardcover one, said that he was muddled.

133
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,281
I think that's not right either.

134
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,801
I think the right word would be distracted.

135
00:13:48,801 --> 00:13:53,041
And it may well be that the same Russian word would do for all of those.

136
00:13:53,041 --> 00:14:05,201
He's a case of the kind of distraction that we've talked about in Pascal, whether it's computer games or tennis or sitting in your room doing geometry like Descartes or a dozen other things.

137
00:14:05,201 --> 00:14:13,961
There are ways to not worry about the problem of what it is to be a human being and that you've got to live your life in one way or another.

138
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:15,480
So he and he does that.

139
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:23,080
He does it by drinking, chasing women, and playing the buffoon.

140
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,801
He didn't have computer games.

141
00:14:25,801 --> 00:14:31,080
Just because he can't, and is that because he can't control his sensuality?

142
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,041
Is he just a sensualist?

143
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:42,041
No, he's trying to forget himself in his drunkenness and sex and avariciousness about money.

144
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:54,441
You can see that on page 33 at the bottom.

145
00:14:54,441 --> 00:15:07,401
Of late, too, he looked somewhat bloated and seemed more irresponsible, more uneven, and sunken into a sort of incoherence, used to begin one thing and go on with another, as though he was letting himself go altogether.

146
00:15:07,401 --> 00:15:09,721
He was more and more frequently drunk.

147
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,240
Well, he is sort of falling apart.

148
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,520
And he's falling apart on purpose.

149
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,960
You'll see that later more.

150
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,281
But you already see it there.

151
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,600
I think there's another place, just a second.

152
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,321
No, that's the main one.

153
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,400
Where do we see him?

154
00:15:47,401 --> 00:15:52,280
We're going to hear more about him being distracted this way.

155
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:57,441
Oh, yeah, when he's in Zostima's cell, and we'll come back to that in a minute.

156
00:15:57,441 --> 00:15:59,520
So we'll get there quickly.

157
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:04,161
So right now, all we know is he's sort of falling apart.

158
00:16:05,441 --> 00:16:13,760
And he's trying, I take it, not to be conscious of having a self, not to be aware of this contradiction.

159
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,921
But it's not that he doesn't know it.

160
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:17,840
It's in his behavior.

161
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:26,401
You can see that he's really worried about it, and he's repressing it and fleeing it, covering up that he's worried about it.

162
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,681
That becomes clear a little bit later.

163
00:16:31,681 --> 00:16:42,480
But it starts to show that he's got a self, and it's contradictory on 21 when his wife dies.

164
00:16:42,480 --> 00:17:01,120
Remember, he has two wives, the strong wife who beat him up, Adelaide, the mother of Dimitri, and a saintly, meek, religious wife, his second wife, who's the mother of Yvonne and Alyasha.

165
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:15,201
And you can't imagine how Dimitri, who's the son of a strong mother, is in the army, and he's tough, and he's sometimes behaves ruthlessly.

166
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:19,921
And you can't imagine either Yvonne or Alyasha behaving like that.

167
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:38,161
But it's interesting, it's one of the brilliant deep things that though they couldn't be more different, Alyasha and Yvonne, and we'll go into them in a minute, they do have something in common that comes from that mother that Dmitry doesn't have at all.

168
00:17:38,161 --> 00:17:41,401
And Dostoevsky's got this all worked out.

169
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:48,201
So let's look at on page now, we're looking on page 21 at the bottom.

170
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,480
It's not Adelaide, it's the which wife is dying here.

171
00:17:54,361 --> 00:17:56,760
It's the saintly one, I think.

172
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:04,121
No, no, it's the one at the top of 21 who is, he didn't beat his wife, he was beaten by her.

173
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:10,201
She was a hot-tempered, bold, dark-browed, impatient woman, possessed of remarkable physical strength.

174
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:16,040
And Dimitri was the child of their child.

175
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:25,161
And then she runs off and dies of either typhus or, as another version had it, of starvation.

176
00:18:25,161 --> 00:18:26,601
Say a word about that.

177
00:18:26,601 --> 00:18:29,800
That Dostoevsky is constantly doing this.

178
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:40,601
And in the name of the supposed author of the book, who is one of the people who lives in the town and who's not very bright and who doesn't try to explain anything.

179
00:18:40,601 --> 00:18:44,921
He just sort of tries to give all the sort of available common sense options.

180
00:18:44,921 --> 00:19:02,120
But in fact, and what Dostoevsky really thinks is that people are complicated and contradictory, and the two seemingly opposed descriptions of which you have to take one or the other could both be right.

181
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:03,960
We'll see that in just a second.

182
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,401
But even the typhus and starvation thing is a hint of it.

183
00:19:07,401 --> 00:19:11,641
I mean, you don't have to decide whether she died of typhus or starvation.

184
00:19:12,121 --> 00:19:15,960
You can die of both if you're living in a garret with no money.

185
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,040
But he says, according to one story, typhus, another starvation.

186
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,361
Now comes the back to Feodor.

187
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:33,760
Theodore Karamatsov was drunk when he heard of his wife's death, and the story is that he ran out into the street and began shouting with joy, raising his hands to heaven, Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace.

188
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:41,681
And others say he wept without restraint like a little child, so much so that people were sorry for him in spite of the repulsion he aroused.

189
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,880
It's quite possible both versions were true.

190
00:19:44,881 --> 00:19:51,921
This is remarkably, seems at first sight very insightful from this author who doesn't really understand much.

191
00:19:51,921 --> 00:19:58,240
It is quite possible that both versions are true, that he rejoiced at his release and at the same time wept for her who released him.

192
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:06,240
As a general rule, people, even the wicked, are much more naive and simple-hearted than we suppose, and we ourselves are too.

193
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,161
You see anything funny about that conclusion after what I've been telling you?

194
00:20:10,161 --> 00:20:14,321
I mean, it doesn't show that people are naive and simple-hearted.

195
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:20,240
It shows that people are complicated, much more complicated than we suppose, and we are too.

196
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,240
People act from double motives, Dostoevsky says in The Idiot.

197
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:32,480
That means they can be acting out of both their, say, compassion and pride.

198
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:41,681
Seemingly impossible combinations happen in Dostoevsky's novels because the self is complicated.

199
00:20:41,681 --> 00:20:43,361
And again, we'll come back to that.

200
00:20:43,361 --> 00:20:51,120
There are all these things that I have to sort of lay out, but pretty soon they all be put back together again.

201
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,121
So there he is, both, but there, back to the general thing.

202
00:20:57,121 --> 00:21:04,320
You see that he's not just a simple buffoon, that he obviously has strong contradictory feelings.

203
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:12,280
That he apparently really loved her and really was annoyed at having her around and beating him up.

204
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,480
So, did I see a hand over here?

205
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:16,281
If so, yes.

206
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:16,921
Yeah.

207
00:21:23,641 --> 00:21:25,641
Ah, see, because you have a different book?

208
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,761
I told you that you're going to have to get this one.

209
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,321
I can't.

210
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,641
I mean, well, let's see how many different books are running around.

211
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,681
If everybody has the same different book, I might be able to do it by chapter.

212
00:21:36,681 --> 00:21:45,960
But the stupid thing about this book, I do it by chapter with no problem, it doesn't have any chapter headings across the pages.

213
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,720
Yours might.

214
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,240
My previous one did.

215
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:54,521
But in this one, I'd have to constantly go flipping around to find the beginning of the chapter, to find the number and the name.

216
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,800
I can't do it.

217
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,081
You've got to buy this one.

218
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,040
Stupid as that seems.

219
00:22:00,441 --> 00:22:01,880
Anything else?

220
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:04,520
Okay, back to where I am.

221
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:22,120
So when Dostoevsky, the way the book is set up is a little bit imperfect in one respect.

222
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:28,600
Sometimes it's told from the point of view of this obtuse narrator who doesn't understand what's going on.

223
00:22:28,601 --> 00:22:34,520
And then when Dostoevsky wants you to understand what's going on, he shows you by the events.

224
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:41,161
And the events often don't go along with this sort of voiceover that's describing them.

225
00:22:41,161 --> 00:22:45,480
And that's a neat move and fun, and he sort of starts out the book that way.

226
00:22:45,480 --> 00:23:01,840
But somewhere along the line, he more or less, Dostoevsky, more or less loses interest in maintaining this distance of the narrator who misses what's going on and who describes what you're seeing in a way that you can see is naive and doesn't fit it.

227
00:23:01,841 --> 00:23:03,840
That just gets to be too complicated.

228
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:13,201
And then pretty soon the narrator starts describing events that he couldn't have been at and starts describing what's going on in people's minds that he couldn't know.

229
00:23:13,201 --> 00:23:15,921
And more and more he sort of fades out.

230
00:23:15,921 --> 00:23:17,441
You don't have to worry about that.

231
00:23:17,601 --> 00:23:18,161
Neither.

232
00:23:18,161 --> 00:23:25,441
You don't have to worry about the fact that you don't have to keep asking yourself who's talking, Dostoevsky or the narrator, because one thing is always clear.

233
00:23:25,441 --> 00:23:32,800
If you keep your eye on what the people are doing, that's the sort of existential bottom line.

234
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,641
Never mind what anybody says.

235
00:23:34,641 --> 00:23:40,560
And people are always making up stories about each other in the book, which may or may not be true.

236
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,960
Some people actually go out of their way to kind of fool other people about their motives.

237
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,841
And Dostoevsky never says they fool people about their motives.

238
00:23:51,841 --> 00:23:58,560
He shows lots of different perspectives on them, and among them that they fool people, and then he shows what they do.

239
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,120
Then you know they are fooling people.

240
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,201
Anything okay about that?

241
00:24:03,841 --> 00:24:04,881
Okay, I'll come back to you.

242
00:24:05,201 --> 00:24:08,161
If you want to say something, you know, raise your hand, wave it around.

243
00:24:09,121 --> 00:24:09,840
I'll stop.

244
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,280
I can't tell whether you're sitting there thinking things until you wave your hands around.

245
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:15,921
Okay.

246
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:22,480
But this, because this book is just so complex that it's not as if we're going to get to the bottom of it ever.

247
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,401
And I'm always learning new things.

248
00:24:24,401 --> 00:24:28,640
So, if you think there's some angle that I'm missing, I'd love to know.

249
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:30,080
Okay, but here we go.

250
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,401
We're at the point.

251
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:51,161
So, now looking at old Karamatsov, Phil, you can see that he's complicated and he's worried about these factors, and that's why he's busy trying to forget them.

252
00:24:52,441 --> 00:25:02,361
So, he says at the bottom of 52: everybody sort of confesses the truth when they're in Father Dasama's monastery cell.

253
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:10,441
He says, Let me play the buffoon.

254
00:25:10,441 --> 00:25:14,040
I'm not afraid of your opinion, for you and every one of you are worse than I am.

255
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,321
That's why I'm a buffoon.

256
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,480
It's from shame, great elder, from shame.

257
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,360
It's simply oversensitiveness that makes me rowdy.

258
00:25:20,361 --> 00:25:21,401
That's all true.

259
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:28,201
If I had only been sure that everyone would accept me as the kindest and wisest of men, oh Lord, what a good man I would have been.

260
00:25:28,201 --> 00:25:31,320
Teacher, he fell suddenly on his knees.

261
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,880
What must I do to gain eternal life?

262
00:25:33,881 --> 00:25:35,880
That's just great.

263
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:40,681
Because, one, you could say, well, look, he's really worrying about the factors.

264
00:25:40,681 --> 00:25:45,401
That's the eternity factor, and he thinks that he's got to find a way of expressing it in his life.

265
00:25:45,401 --> 00:25:48,441
But on the other hand, he's buffooning as usual.

266
00:25:48,441 --> 00:25:54,840
So, as the book goes on, it was difficult even now to decide whether he was joking or really moved.

267
00:25:54,841 --> 00:25:57,480
And I think the answer, as usual, is both.

268
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:05,161
That is, he's really moved, and he's making a fool of himself and joking to cover up from himself and everybody else that he's really moved.

269
00:26:05,401 --> 00:26:13,960
And that gets clearer because it turns out that he's very worried about his eternal soul.

270
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:24,001
And Sosima says, don't lie, and he admits he's been lying all along, but that's not so important.

271
00:26:23,641 --> 00:26:26,800
On 98 is the next thing that's important.

272
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,001
And this is just, I mean, as if we didn't know already.

273
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,080
I mean, I hope I've already convinced you.

274
00:26:34,081 --> 00:26:38,240
He's not dumb and he's not muddled, just and senseless.

275
00:26:38,401 --> 00:26:41,441
He's got just the same problem of himself as everybody else.

276
00:26:41,441 --> 00:26:43,361
He's just trying not to face it.

277
00:26:43,361 --> 00:26:59,280
So at the bottom of 98, corrupt and often cruel in his lust, like some poisonous insect, Fedor Karamasov was sometimes in moments of drunkenness overcome by superstitious terror and a moral convulsion that took an almost physical form.

278
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:04,480
My soul simply quakes in my throat at those times, he used to say.

279
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,161
And he wanted to skipping down a little somebody to defend him.

280
00:27:08,161 --> 00:27:09,280
From whom?

281
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,360
From somebody unknown, but terrible and dangerous.

282
00:27:13,361 --> 00:27:30,560
So in short, he's got the usual kind of fear of punishment and he's got a sense of guilt and he's very much worried about these things, but he also covers them up and doesn't want to face them.

283
00:27:31,201 --> 00:27:34,080
And so he keeps himself very busy.

284
00:27:34,081 --> 00:27:46,881
And in the middle of 134, just a passing remark, he says, the Lord God has given us so little time, only 24 hours in the day, so that one hasn't even time to get sleep enough, much less to repent of one's sins.

285
00:27:46,881 --> 00:28:00,240
So the moral is, if you keep yourself busy with women and drink and business trips and so forth, you don't have time to worry about the state of your eternal soul.

286
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,560
And now, now comes a very interesting thing in this book.

287
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,841
I try sometimes to read about brothers Karamatso, but I never find anything interesting.

288
00:28:08,401 --> 00:28:14,761
If you ever happen to be reading about it and find something interesting, let me know.

289
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,040
For instance, I've never seen anybody say something which is really funny and kind of obvious.

290
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:31,480
Every one of the brothers has a female counterpart who has exactly the same existential stance as they have.

291
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,240
And you can look for it, and you'll find it every time.

292
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,640
You probably don't know, you probably haven't been far enough or haven't been looking enough.

293
00:28:39,641 --> 00:28:50,280
Who else is sort of so keeps herself, that's a clue, herself, so busy that she doesn't have time to think about her eternal soul.

294
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:55,161
And distraction is her big job.

295
00:28:55,161 --> 00:28:56,441
You remember who that could be?

296
00:28:56,441 --> 00:28:57,000
Yeah.

297
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,081
No, no, no, you'll get there by the end of today.

298
00:29:01,081 --> 00:29:04,520
Grushenka is not somebody else who's double.

299
00:29:06,441 --> 00:29:08,041
Well, this is what you wouldn't expect.

300
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,000
64.

301
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,840
It's Lisa's mother, Mrs.

302
00:29:10,841 --> 00:29:21,240
Holotoff, who is also dithering around all the time so as not to face their real suffering.

303
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,401
And she's just a wonderful character.

304
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:26,840
I'll just read the crucial thing where she's at the top of 64.

305
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:32,441
She's freaking out and breaking down in front of the father's osmo, like everybody else.

306
00:29:32,441 --> 00:29:34,681
And she says, I've been suffering for so long.

307
00:29:34,681 --> 00:29:35,401
I'm suffering.

308
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:35,960
Forgive me.

309
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,080
I'm suffering.

310
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:41,720
And then skipping a little, I suffer from lack of faith.

311
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,401
He says, lack of faith in God.

312
00:29:43,401 --> 00:29:49,640
Oh, no, I dare not even think about that, because life after death is such an enigma, and no one, no one can solve it.

313
00:29:49,641 --> 00:29:51,000
Listen, you're a healer.

314
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,840
You're deeply versed in humanity.

315
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:57,121
And of course, I dare not expect you to believe me entirely, but I assure you, and so forth and so forth.

316
00:29:54,040 --> 00:30:00,561
The thought of life beyond the grave fills me with anguish, with terror.

317
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,960
See, just like just like old Karamatsov in his moments of lucidity.

318
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,360
And I don't know to whom to appeal, and have not dared to all my life.

319
00:30:09,361 --> 00:30:15,681
And now I am so bold enough to ask you, oh God, what will you think of me now?

320
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:18,960
You notice anything crazy about that speech?

321
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:25,840
I mean, just when she's finally confessing her deepest fear, she's worrying about whether she's making a fool of herself.

322
00:30:25,841 --> 00:30:29,201
And this is this, it's like old Karamatsov.

323
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:39,360
She's constantly sort of acting, where with him, remember, the comment was they could never, they didn't know whether he was serious or not when he breaks down and says, I fear for eternity.

324
00:30:39,361 --> 00:30:43,841
And now she's saying, I don't understand the afterlife.

325
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:46,000
I don't understand, in effect, eternity.

326
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,760
Oh, I must be making a fool of myself.

327
00:30:48,641 --> 00:30:49,841
What do you think of me now?

328
00:30:49,841 --> 00:30:52,480
As if she was at a dinner party, being stupid.

329
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:54,080
So she's the double.

330
00:30:54,081 --> 00:31:05,120
I mean, she's down to the tiniest detail, the existential counterpart of old Karamatsov, even though she's not drinking and debauched in business.

331
00:31:05,121 --> 00:31:10,161
Her existential business is running around, keeping from thinking.

332
00:31:10,161 --> 00:31:13,201
And so, next.

333
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,080
Well, so much for old Karamatsov.

334
00:31:16,081 --> 00:31:18,720
We go on to Levon, unless anybody has something.

335
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,120
Old Karamatsov, oh, I realize I didn't turn this on.

336
00:31:23,121 --> 00:31:26,801
Thanks to the marvels of iPods, it don't really need to turn it off.

337
00:31:27,441 --> 00:31:32,480
Are you all how many listening to this on their iPod or their podcast thing?

338
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,280
Probably.

339
00:31:34,081 --> 00:31:35,441
I'm so glad you're all here.

340
00:31:35,441 --> 00:31:36,321
Thanks for coming.

341
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,201
Instead of listening as you run around, it makes me happy to see you.

342
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:51,560
I trust that it's sure that it makes a difference if you're sitting here following, wondering whether you should take the risk of saying something and then taking the risk sometime of saying something.

343
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,320
That's how you learn things.

344
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:59,080
And that's whoever you are out there with your iPods listening to this, you're missing something.

345
00:31:59,081 --> 00:32:00,040
Okay.

346
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,280
Now, we're on to Yvonne.

347
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:04,760
Okay.

348
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:14,921
Now, Yvonne, I don't know about you, but Yvonne was by far my favorite Karamatsov when I read the book in high school, or I think senior year.

349
00:32:14,921 --> 00:32:19,001
And it's obviously why.

350
00:32:19,001 --> 00:32:24,041
He's very, he's the intellectual in the family.

351
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:26,281
He's very clean-cut.

352
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:32,921
He's very honest with himself and everybody else, or so it looks anyway, and so he tries.

353
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,480
And it's, and he, guess what?

354
00:32:35,481 --> 00:32:39,560
Is a philosophy major in college and doing very well at it.

355
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:40,841
So we'll see now.

356
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:47,001
He turns out to be, however, furthest from salvation.

357
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:53,641
And yet he has the same mother as Alyosha, who Alyosha is nearest to salvation.

358
00:32:53,641 --> 00:32:55,641
But they're on the same dimension.

359
00:32:55,641 --> 00:33:02,680
They're on a kind of spiritual dimension where Dimitri isn't, and certainly old Karamatsov isn't.

360
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:04,361
And so here we go.

361
00:33:04,681 --> 00:33:16,921
They're so different that old Karamatsov forgets their brothers and yet, they have the same saintly mother, and they have, in a certain sense, the same concern.

362
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:26,320
And they also, interestingly enough, both have a problem of being visited by devils somewhere in the course of the book, hallucinating devils.

363
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:37,681
That's hardly make much of a fuss about it, about Alyasha's devils, because he makes a whole chapter with Yvonne confronting his devil.

364
00:33:37,681 --> 00:33:42,401
But the issue for them is purity.

365
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:49,921
They both want to be pure, but they have completely different understandings of what it is to be pure.

366
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,881
And we'll see that in a minute.

367
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,840
I thought we would see it right now, but I'm surprised.

368
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,441
Did I pass that?

369
00:34:00,001 --> 00:34:01,440
I just decided to do it later.

370
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,600
Okay, I decided to do it later.

371
00:34:03,601 --> 00:34:08,481
We have to take a sort of step-by-step sneaking up start on it.

372
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:11,840
But I'll just tell you to begin with: they have two senses of purity.

373
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:17,921
Yvonne has a Greek sense of purity, and Alyasha has a Judeo-Christian sense of purity.

374
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,521
And purity means entirely different things to the two of them.

375
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,760
I might as well finish saying this.

376
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,960
We'll come back to it, though.

377
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:27,601
There's two words in German.

378
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:35,841
The first time I understood anything in the Brothers Karamatsov that was really important was when I read a book in German by an Italian priest.

379
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,760
He really understood a lot.

380
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:44,880
And one of the things he had was this important distinction which you can make in German between Rheinheit and Lauterkeit.

381
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,561
I'll write it on this board later.

382
00:34:46,561 --> 00:34:50,720
And Rheiningung is what happens when you take something to the cleaners.

383
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:55,121
And that means you get the dirt out and wash it away.

384
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,320
And that's how you get cleanliness.

385
00:35:00,001 --> 00:35:02,401
Reinheit is like cleanliness.

386
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,720
Lauterkeit is purity.

387
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:17,641
It comes from taking up and transforming all the dark side, all this part of you that you want to get rid of, and making it somehow into some positive part of you.

388
00:35:17,961 --> 00:35:23,960
And of course, the Rhineheit, the cleanliness side is the Greek side.

389
00:35:23,961 --> 00:35:31,481
I mean, where you want to die to your body in the finitude and just get rid of all these appetites and all these bad, distracting things.

390
00:35:31,481 --> 00:35:51,401
And what Jesus promises, it's not really a Judeo, it's a strictly Christian thing, is a kind of purity where everything about you will be transformed so that there isn't any somehow even the dark side becomes something positive.

391
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,840
And of course you could tell which brother is doing which.

392
00:35:54,840 --> 00:36:00,760
You ought to be able to tell even now, Yvonne, which one of these is Yvonne?

393
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,361
The what?

394
00:36:07,641 --> 00:36:09,160
Yeah, that's right.

395
00:36:09,161 --> 00:36:10,600
The cleanliness one.

396
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:15,961
I mean, that's why it makes sense for him to be a philosopher, which is a Greek business.

397
00:36:16,121 --> 00:36:18,041
In fact, I think he's a kind of Platonist.

398
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:18,920
There's a hint of that.

399
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:28,041
And the one who's obviously struggling for purity, and it's a big problem for him, is Alyasha.

400
00:36:29,161 --> 00:36:30,121
We'll see about that.

401
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:32,440
But now let's go through Yvonne step by step.

402
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,041
I jumped ahead.

403
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,720
Yvonne is a self-made man.

404
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:57,201
He realizes early on that he's living off relatives and dependent on them, and probably they even resent having him around, but they have to rescue him because after his wife dies, old Karamatsov just ignores the children and they're running around sort of in terrors.

405
00:36:57,201 --> 00:37:02,561
And so some relatives or other take over Yvonne.

406
00:37:02,561 --> 00:37:07,521
And I think other different relatives, it's not spelled out, take over the other children.

407
00:37:07,521 --> 00:37:10,561
They are all taken up by somebody.

408
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:16,961
But the fascinating thing is that Yvonne and Alyasha have entirely different reactions.

409
00:37:16,961 --> 00:37:28,001
Yvonne resents the fact that he has to be taken care of and be dependent on some other people, and that he has a father who is an embarrassment.

410
00:37:28,001 --> 00:37:29,600
Alyasha is just the opposite.

411
00:37:29,601 --> 00:37:32,961
He never notices that he's dependent on others for support.

412
00:37:32,961 --> 00:37:38,161
People are always glad to take care of him, and he's always glad to let them take care of him.

413
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,960
Keep your eyes open for something you can help me answer.

414
00:37:40,961 --> 00:37:44,880
A question I got in my head too late last time to read.

415
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,120
I can't read the whole book through to find out.

416
00:37:47,440 --> 00:38:00,720
I think that Alyasha, after he leaves the monastery, where of course they give him food and clothes, never seems to have a problem about nice clothes he's described as wearing.

417
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,801
At one point he's described as walking around eating a a roll, bread roll, because he was hungry.

418
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,321
People feed him, people clothe him, people take care of him, but we've never told who.

419
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:20,000
And it just doesn't even occur to him, and therefore it doesn't sort of show up in anything he does, because he's even grateful.

420
00:38:20,001 --> 00:38:24,920
He just accepts that he would take care of anybody that needed taking care of it.

421
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,640
Anybody would take care of him because he needs taking care of.

422
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:30,560
And we'll see.

423
00:38:30,561 --> 00:38:31,600
I mean, keep your eye open.

424
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:34,240
Tell me if you find out who's who's housing.

425
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,760
I don't even know where he's living.

426
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,001
Who's where does he live after he leaves the monastery?

427
00:38:38,561 --> 00:38:42,920
And where did he get these nice clothes that the kids admire at one point?

428
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,760
I have no idea.

429
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:49,321
And I think Dostoevsky is doing that on purpose, or else I'm missing him.

430
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,361
Okay.

431
00:38:50,681 --> 00:39:02,841
Now, so Ivan, because he doesn't want to be dependent on others, the way Alyasha is, and take anything from them, is determined to be self-sufficient.

432
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:10,521
So, whereas Alyasha lets anybody take care of him, and as you'll see, Dimitri is trying to get money from his father all the time.

433
00:39:11,001 --> 00:39:18,521
Yvonne, from the very start, and it's admirable, tries to take care of himself on 27.

434
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:25,960
See, starting at the, about two-thirds down, the paragraph that begins, I won't go into detail.

435
00:39:25,961 --> 00:39:28,201
I'll read you something that I've been talking about.

436
00:39:28,201 --> 00:39:34,361
Of the elder, Yvonne, I will only say that he grew into a somewhat morose and reserved, though far from timid boy.

437
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:45,321
At 10 years of age, he had realized that he and his brother were not living in their own home, but on other people's charity, and that their father was a man of whom it was disgraceful to speak.

438
00:39:45,641 --> 00:39:51,080
Then he also very early was brilliant and showed an unusual aptitude for learning.

439
00:39:51,081 --> 00:39:52,521
You see that next.

440
00:39:52,521 --> 00:40:04,280
And then in the next paragraph, it says in the second sentence, he entered a university, and all the time he was in the university, somewhere it says what he studied.

441
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,881
I guess we haven't got to that.

442
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,561
He studies, oh yeah, next page.

443
00:40:07,561 --> 00:40:17,881
But anyway, he enters the university, and all the time he was in the university, he was forced to support himself all the time he was studying.

444
00:40:18,201 --> 00:40:19,800
And that's interesting.

445
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:26,400
But Dostoevsky is always making sort of three-cornered shots with one ball or whatever.

446
00:40:26,641 --> 00:40:32,720
And he isn't enough to just tell you that he's got a job and supports himself when he's in the university.

447
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,561
He tells you what job.

448
00:40:34,561 --> 00:40:39,361
And the job he's got is just wonderful for understanding him a little further.

449
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,320
However, that may seem, let's see, what were he?

450
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:43,760
Oh, this is fun.

451
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,480
I skipped something.

452
00:40:44,481 --> 00:40:46,481
I haven't marked it, but I'll read it.

453
00:40:46,481 --> 00:41:00,801
It must be noted that he did not even attempt to communicate with his father, perhaps from pride, perhaps from contempt for him, or perhaps from his cool common sense, which told him that from such a father he would get no assistance.

454
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,801
Do you have to choose one of those?

455
00:41:03,121 --> 00:41:04,000
Do they know?

456
00:41:04,001 --> 00:41:05,280
You want them all, I presume.

457
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:12,800
It makes it with for his father, with pride, and sense, and good.

458
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,321
So he had three good reasons for not getting in touch with his father.

459
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,760
It's interesting to know the three brothers' relation to the father.

460
00:41:20,001 --> 00:41:24,001
Yvonne, who has this sort of intellectual attitude, has contempt.

461
00:41:24,001 --> 00:41:29,921
Dimitri, who's the emotional hothead in the family, has loathing for the father.

462
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:39,121
And Alyasha, of course, has commiseration and understanding and loves him and helps, tries to help become a better person.

463
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,480
But back to here now.

464
00:41:40,481 --> 00:41:41,681
He supports himself.

465
00:41:41,681 --> 00:41:42,080
How?

466
00:41:42,081 --> 00:41:44,161
At the bottom of 27.

467
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:56,720
Yvonne wasn't despondent and succeeded in getting work, at first getting lessons, and afterwards, this is the good part, getting paragraphs on street incidents into the newspapers under the signature of eyewitness.

468
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:05,120
Now, that's just a little subtle thing that goes by, because you don't know yet that Yvonne is the spectator of everything.

469
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:11,001
That's part of his philosophical perspective.

470
00:42:09,041 --> 00:42:13,480
He is the aloof observer.

471
00:42:14,121 --> 00:42:21,240
He's sort of visiting the world and looking in on it and judging it, but not taking any part.

472
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,281
I'll give you more examples before we leave Yvonne.

473
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:35,321
But that he should be observing people who are presumably intensely involved in something, having a lover's quarrel or stealing an apple and being chased by the merchant or whatever.

474
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:43,961
So the people are involved, and Yvonne is there watching it with complete equanimity, writing down what's happening and selling it to the newspaper.

475
00:42:44,121 --> 00:42:54,841
And that little touch is just so neat because it's so characteristic of his real, it's part of his very existential stance that he would get a job like that.

476
00:42:55,481 --> 00:42:57,481
And what else?

477
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,680
Where am I?

478
00:42:58,681 --> 00:43:00,121
27?

479
00:43:00,121 --> 00:43:01,000
28?

480
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:06,281
Oh, yeah, well, I just want to point out about 15 lines down, he was a student of natural science.

481
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,201
See, I said he was philosophy.

482
00:43:08,201 --> 00:43:10,600
I think he's a student of natural philosophy.

483
00:43:10,601 --> 00:43:17,961
That really hasn't branched out into philosophy and science yet in Dostoevsky's time, at the time of the brothers.

484
00:43:17,961 --> 00:43:33,481
So it was a study of the nature, but also of human nature, and it was what you would be naturing in, I think, at least if you were a philosopher in your interests.

485
00:43:35,081 --> 00:43:36,760
And where else?

486
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,881
Okay, so much for that aspect of it.

487
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:47,321
So we've got him now showing pride.

488
00:43:47,641 --> 00:43:52,441
Being self-sufficient is not, is a great thing for the Greeks.

489
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,121
I mean, Agamemnon was self-sufficient.

490
00:43:54,641 --> 00:43:56,961
All heroes are self-sufficient.

491
00:43:56,961 --> 00:44:03,921
And generally, the only alternative to being self-sufficient is to be slavishly dependent on somebody or something.

492
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,880
But, of course, from a Christian point of view, we talked about that.

493
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,760
Being self-sufficient is a very, very bad thing.

494
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:37,520
Pride is the thing that we are the people at the bottom of the inferno in Dante who are self-sufficient, who are so detached and cold-blooded that they're literally frozen in ice, and who, and I mentioned this, I think, but I'll mention it again because of the third man, the bottom people are so self-sufficient that they're ready to betray anybody just for their self, just to be self-sufficient.

495
00:44:37,521 --> 00:44:38,800
That's Harry Lyme.

496
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,201
Those are the worst things.

497
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:49,601
Our people are the totally selfish and totally self-sufficient and thereby betraying type of people.

498
00:44:49,601 --> 00:44:54,881
Yvonne's got a big betrayal problem going on later in the book.

499
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,441
Oh, yeah, okay.

500
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:23,441
So now we will see what happens in Zosima's cell, where everybody is revealing that Justin is very clever to have this family meltdown take place in Zosima's cell, where everybody tells you right off in front of everybody else what they are really up to.

501
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,081
And that's a good way to get started.

502
00:45:26,081 --> 00:45:30,720
And so everybody's confessing, and everybody's going crazy.

503
00:45:31,681 --> 00:45:34,001
And guess what?

504
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,921
Alyasha is totally involved and upset.

505
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:44,440
And Yvonne is watching this like a spectator, as if he was going to, you know, he could give a story to the newspaper.

506
00:45:38,481 --> 00:45:45,880
Oh, he's not going to do that with this one.

507
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:51,401
At the bottom of 51, Alyasha stood with hanging head on the verge of tears.

508
00:45:51,400 --> 00:46:09,881
What seemed to him strangest of all was that his brother Yvonne, on whom alone he had rested his hopes and who alone had such influence on his father that he could have stopped him, sat quite unmoved with downcast eyes, apparently waiting with interest to see how it would end, as though he had nothing to do with it.

509
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:18,121
That really sums up this observer stance of Yvonne.

510
00:46:20,041 --> 00:46:37,001
And Dostoevsky, as a Christian, but a very special sort of Christian, is very, very down on this sort of detached self-sufficiency in which someone doesn't feel involved with other human beings and the world at all.

511
00:46:37,001 --> 00:46:42,840
Ivan is just too good for this world, and that's not a position to want.

512
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,681
That turns out not to be a good position to be in, as you can imagine.

513
00:46:46,681 --> 00:46:48,840
But Dostoevsky has to show you.

514
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,121
He can't just tell you.

515
00:46:50,121 --> 00:46:55,481
And it takes a while until we see how badly things go for him.

516
00:46:55,481 --> 00:46:56,841
But let's go on.

517
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,121
So he's an intellectual.

518
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,681
He's the only brother that goes to the university.

519
00:47:02,681 --> 00:47:04,600
Alyasha went to the monastery.

520
00:47:04,601 --> 00:47:06,441
Dimitri goes to the army.

521
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,041
Everybody goes where they belong.

522
00:47:08,041 --> 00:47:10,601
And Yvonne goes to the university.

523
00:47:11,561 --> 00:47:23,760
And he's all of this, and particularly, I think going into philosophy and science, is something that shows that he's striving for some goal that they mostly can't understand.

524
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,601
And they're trying to figure out what Yvonne really wants.

525
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,321
And you can see it if you will keep your eyes open.

526
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:45,841
On 42, 10 lines, 8, 2, 4, 6 lines down, Alyasha, that is he, attributed his brother's coolness at first to a difference in their age and education.

527
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:52,801
But he also wondered whether the absence of curiosity and sympathy in Yvonne might be due to some other cause entirely unknown to him.

528
00:47:52,800 --> 00:48:02,561
He kept thinking that Yvonne was absorbed in something, something inward and important, that he was striving towards some goal, perhaps very hard to attain.

529
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,521
Well, that's right, he is.

530
00:48:05,521 --> 00:48:13,041
And the goal is, you get clearer about it, on 77.

531
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:29,441
This very elusive conversation between Sasam and Yvonne, which is very important and interesting and obscure, on 77.

532
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,161
I'm going to read it starting about a third down.

533
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:40,001
Father Zasfa asked Yvonne.

534
00:48:42,161 --> 00:48:43,281
It's complicated.

535
00:48:43,601 --> 00:48:48,801
Dostieski is sort of laying out a whole lot of his philosophy on these two pages.

536
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:57,641
And it's about if there's no God, then all things are possible, as somebody says later in the book.

537
00:48:57,641 --> 00:48:59,520
Who says Yvonne.

538
00:48:59,681 --> 00:49:02,481
But he doesn't say it quite that way here, he said.

539
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:10,921
But he does say at the bottom 76 that it's only because of religion and belief in immortality that people are good.

540
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:18,521
If you destroy in mankind the belief in immortality, not only love but every living force maintaining the life of the world would be dried up.

541
00:49:18,521 --> 00:49:20,440
Moreover, nothing would be immoral.

542
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,481
Everything would be lawful, even cannibalism.

543
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:30,121
And jumping ahead, Zosima says, Do you really believe that?

544
00:49:30,121 --> 00:49:31,400
The middle of.

545
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,201
Is that really your conviction?

546
00:49:34,201 --> 00:49:36,441
A third of the way down on 77.

547
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:41,800
As to the consequences of the disappearance of faith and immortality, Father Zima now asks Yvonne.

548
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,401
Yes, that's my contention.

549
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:46,361
There is no virtue if there's no immortality.

550
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:49,720
You are blessed in believing that, or else most unhappy.

551
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,001
Why unhappy?

552
00:49:51,001 --> 00:49:52,681
Yvonne asks, smiling.

553
00:49:52,681 --> 00:49:59,961
Because in all probability, you yourself don't believe in the immortality of your soul, nor in what you've written in your article on church jurisdiction.

554
00:49:59,961 --> 00:50:03,881
We have to discuss the article on church jurisdiction at a different later.

555
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:10,601
Perhaps you were right, but I wasn't altogether joking, Yvonne suddenly and strangely confessed, blushing quickly.

556
00:50:10,601 --> 00:50:13,640
You were not altogether joking, that's true.

557
00:50:13,641 --> 00:50:15,480
The question is still bothering your heart.

558
00:50:15,481 --> 00:50:16,840
It is still unanswered.

559
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:23,161
That the martyr sometimes likes to divert himself with his despair, as if driven to it by despair itself.

560
00:50:23,161 --> 00:50:27,641
Meanwhile, in your despair, you too divert yourself.

561
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:33,240
And they're still discussing this question of immortality.

562
00:50:33,561 --> 00:50:39,641
It's a question you have not answered, and this is your great grief, for it clamors for an answer.

563
00:50:40,201 --> 00:50:41,240
That's what Zosima says.

564
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:49,321
But can it be answered by me, answered in the affirmative, Ivan went on, asking strangely, still looking at the elder with the same inexplicable smile.

565
00:50:49,641 --> 00:50:54,320
Then Zosima says this interesting, complicated thing.

566
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:58,560
If it can't be decided in the affirmative, you will never decide in the negative.

567
00:50:58,561 --> 00:50:59,360
You know that.

568
00:50:53,800 --> 00:51:01,280
That is the peculiarity of your heart.

569
00:51:02,081 --> 00:51:03,360
That's the self.

570
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,441
And all this suffering is due to it.

571
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,360
But thank the Creator who's given you a heart capable of such suffering.

572
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,641
Remember, suffering is a good thing.

573
00:51:10,641 --> 00:51:11,441
You can see that.

574
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,681
Of thinking and seeking higher things.

575
00:51:13,681 --> 00:51:16,960
That sounds platonic, thinking and seeking higher things.

576
00:51:16,961 --> 00:51:18,801
What's wrong with things around here?

577
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,401
For our dwelling is in the heavens, Zosima said.

578
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:32,400
I'm going to try to convince you later that Zosima is sort of traditional kind of Christianity mixed up with Platonism, that he never quite gets it right.

579
00:51:33,201 --> 00:51:33,920
But almost.

580
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,281
So here he says, so our dwelling is in the heavens.

581
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,641
God grant that your heart will attain the answer on earth.

582
00:51:40,641 --> 00:51:42,240
And may God bless your path.

583
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,280
So he's got his foot in both of the stories.

584
00:51:45,521 --> 00:51:50,240
He's like Kierkegaard in thinking that if you're not blissful on earth, then you've lost it.

585
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,441
You're in despair.

586
00:51:52,001 --> 00:52:01,441
Even if there is an afterlife, you should be able to get meaning and bliss here in the finite temporal on earth.

587
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:08,081
But he also thinks in a way that Kierkegaard would never say, I think, that our dwelling is in the heavens.

588
00:52:08,081 --> 00:52:15,281
That's Plato-like, saying that we all should be and are, in a way, friends of God and can merge with God.

589
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,121
So anyway, so Zosima is this interesting character.

590
00:52:19,121 --> 00:52:26,720
And whenever he reads Zasima, you have to see that he's so, so advanced, and he's made Christian love into a science, as it says in some place.

591
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,480
And you can see here, he's a super therapist.

592
00:52:28,481 --> 00:52:39,201
He's gotten them all confessing, an existential therapist, confessing their ultimate existential ambitions and fears in one afternoon and giving them advice about how to fix it.

593
00:52:40,121 --> 00:52:43,481
But yet, he never quite gets it.

594
00:52:43,481 --> 00:52:47,080
And why he doesn't quite get it, I can't tell you yet.

595
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:49,160
So, where are we?

596
00:52:49,481 --> 00:52:52,120
Okay, we just did the goal.

597
00:52:52,121 --> 00:52:56,361
We haven't quite done the goal because it gets a little clearer what the goal is.

598
00:52:57,481 --> 00:53:01,960
This goal is in some way a kind of eternal perfection.

599
00:53:01,961 --> 00:53:07,481
And now I want to say he wants to be pure, but I don't think I should say that.

600
00:53:07,481 --> 00:53:09,400
He wants to be clean.

601
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,000
Clear.

602
00:53:11,001 --> 00:53:14,601
No, clear is too much like purity.

603
00:53:14,601 --> 00:53:16,361
He wants to be clean.

604
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:19,801
And that's the sense in which he's a Platonist.

605
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:30,920
And if our dwelling was in heaven, then why shouldn't we just leave the earth and go and dwell in the heaven?

606
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:37,641
And all of stuff that comes from having bodies and all of that stuff would just be left behind.

607
00:53:37,641 --> 00:53:42,440
And that's not Dostoevsky's idea, and it's not Kierkegaard's idea of the finite.

608
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:45,881
The temporal and finite are just as important as the eternal.

609
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,361
And earth is just as important as heaven.

610
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:53,240
And unless you get the earthly and the heavenly together, you haven't got it made.

611
00:53:53,561 --> 00:53:55,720
That's Dostoevsky's formulation of it.

612
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:59,720
He has lots of formulations of it, but one of them is that way of thinking about it.

613
00:54:00,601 --> 00:54:10,361
And Sostima understands that, and he's trying to steer Ivan in this right direction of getting the earthly and heavenly together.

614
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:13,481
And I just read the part where he said it.

615
00:54:16,041 --> 00:54:28,081
So he wants Ivan to seek perfection, not in the lofty, intellectual, prideful reasoning, but something more lowly.

616
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:29,360
He wants him to get involved with people.

617
00:54:29,601 --> 00:54:33,041
He wants him to get involved with living in this, in the world.

618
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:36,560
And Yvonne, of course, is going to resist that.

619
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,641
Very much resist.

620
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,201
So then comes my story about the two kinds of purity now.

621
00:54:43,521 --> 00:54:48,720
What Yvonne wants is this kind of Reinheit cleanliness.

622
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,560
And what he should be wanting is the kind of purity.

623
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,960
I'll give you an example of the purity in just a minute.

624
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,880
I'm going to catch up to where I am.

625
00:54:58,481 --> 00:55:06,240
So Yvonne wants to get rid of what he calls the lackey side, the Karamatsa side, the earthy side of his nature.

626
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:10,801
If you look at the picture of the self, you can see Yvonne has those factors.

627
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:16,320
And that's his idea of the earthy factors are also called lackey factors.

628
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,481
I hope they still are in this translation.

629
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,321
I think they are.

630
00:55:21,201 --> 00:55:24,081
But lofty has been translated fine in one place.

631
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:26,080
Not quite right.

632
00:55:26,081 --> 00:55:30,321
Lofty's got to be up toward this heavenly.

633
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,320
So keep your eyes open for that.

634
00:55:32,641 --> 00:55:35,521
That whether, how the factors get named.

635
00:55:35,521 --> 00:55:39,121
Tell me if they get named differently than I named them on the chart.

636
00:55:39,121 --> 00:55:41,121
That's just one more reason to find.

637
00:55:41,121 --> 00:55:42,641
I'll find a small book next time.

638
00:55:42,641 --> 00:55:44,720
That's what you all want, but it won't be this book.

639
00:55:44,961 --> 00:55:48,881
To find a small book that doesn't mess with the fruitful words.

640
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,480
Okay, now let's see.

641
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:55,120
So he wants to be rid of the lackey side.

642
00:55:55,121 --> 00:55:58,321
It's very important that he calls it the Karamatsa side.

643
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:02,161
That's the sensualist insect, earthy side.

644
00:56:02,161 --> 00:56:04,641
And he wants to be out of that.

645
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:12,201
So he's in despair at not willing to be himself, because he is a Karamasa, and he has got an earthy side.

646
00:56:12,521 --> 00:56:16,281
He'd like to be an angel, but he's not an angel.

647
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:23,321
And remember the line from Pascal: we are neither angels nor brutes, and he who would play the angel plays the brute.

648
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:28,121
You should get a glimmer from Pascal that Yvonne is going to be very dangerous.

649
00:56:28,521 --> 00:56:30,920
And it's just sort of Graham-Greene-like intuition.

650
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:41,161
People who try to be pure and innocent and absolutely good and not involved with evil, they're dangerous people.

651
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:58,601
So the and what would be purity would be being compassionate with people and accepting all your impulses, and then they would gradually become good.

652
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:01,000
That's what Zosima thinks.

653
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:02,760
And then Matt Zosima is right.

654
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,841
I mean, Dostoevsky agrees with him.

655
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,240
This is on page 66.

656
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:13,960
Interestingly enough, it comes in a speech that Zosima gives to Mrs.

657
00:57:13,961 --> 00:57:19,561
Holokoff, who's worried so much about her bad side.

658
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:37,001
And he says, What seems to you bad within you, this is about a third of the way down on 66, will grow purer and the very fact of your fact of your observing it in yourself.

659
00:57:37,001 --> 00:57:40,681
Avoid fear, too, though fear is only the result of falsehood.

660
00:57:40,681 --> 00:57:43,961
Never be frightened at your own faint-heartedness and so forth.

661
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:46,041
Skipping down a lot.

662
00:57:46,681 --> 00:57:50,521
Active love is a labor, the end of the paragraph now.

663
00:57:50,521 --> 00:57:54,201
And fortitude for some people, too, perhaps complete science, that's him.

664
00:57:54,880 --> 00:58:09,201
But I predict that just when you see with horror that, in spite of all your efforts, you are getting further from your goal instead of nearer it, at that very moment I predict that you will reach it and be cold, clearly, the miraculous power of the Lord.

665
00:58:09,201 --> 00:58:11,520
Gee, that's not quite the quote I expected.

666
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:12,561
It's not wrong.

667
00:58:12,561 --> 00:58:22,321
There's a place where he tells her that if she dwells on the bad side of her and accepts it, she'll be okay.

668
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,360
Did he say that?

669
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:24,720
Not quite.

670
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,801
Well, let me see if I can find it.

671
00:58:47,201 --> 00:58:47,840
Hmm.

672
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,280
No, I have to make a note.

673
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,720
I'll tell you next time.

674
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,760
There's a place where he says, if you've come, if you find it, let me know.

675
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:02,240
He says if you sort of contemplate and face up to the bad side of yourself.

676
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,121
Does it say that?

677
00:59:03,201 --> 00:59:03,840
I don't think so.

678
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:04,880
Does it ever?

679
00:59:05,201 --> 00:59:06,961
Not quite clearly.

680
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,041
It will become pure.

681
00:59:09,041 --> 00:59:10,320
It's sort of implicit in there.

682
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:17,201
That's the moment when, just when you look at yourself with horror, you discover everything is going to turn out all right.

683
00:59:17,201 --> 00:59:29,681
But I'm still trying to keep looking for a minute because there's a place where it's important, very important, to get the right view of purity.

684
00:59:59,081 --> 01:00:01,800
Well, I guess maybe, well, for the time being, we'll have to settle.

685
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:07,321
What seems to you bad within you will grow purer from the very fact of your observing it in yourself.

686
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,041
I did read it, I just didn't see that.

687
01:00:10,121 --> 01:00:11,400
I thought he was going to explain it.

688
01:00:11,561 --> 01:00:12,760
That's the idea.

689
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:16,841
And we'll find it happening in Utea later in the book.

690
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:27,641
So, one way to put it is that Yvonne is trying to be like Plato, and Alyasha is trying to be like Jesus.

691
01:00:27,641 --> 01:00:33,641
That is, two just different ways of being a good person, being pure.

692
01:00:33,961 --> 01:00:35,800
Now, back to Yvonne.

693
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:44,760
Yvonne, little clues that Yvonne is a Platonist you can find around on 561, for instance, jumping way ahead of where you are, but it doesn't matter.

694
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:48,281
It happens to be, it could have been said anywhere in the book.

695
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:53,080
Somebody just says in passing, I forget who says it, who says it.

696
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:01,720
Dimitri says it at the bottom of that big paragraph on 561.

697
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,841
Yvonne has no God, he has an idea.

698
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:13,720
Well, I mean, if you're stretching a little, Plato thinks that ideas are these otherworldly, pure forms that we should merge with.

699
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:18,841
And that is his goal, to get out of the world and merge with these pure forms.

700
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:29,921
And now, all we need, we've already discussed Yvonne, oh, old Taramasov and his double.

701
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,720
Who's the double of Yvonne?

702
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:37,281
You probably haven't read far enough, but yeah, you should have to get a glimmer.

703
01:01:40,161 --> 01:01:46,001
Who is the one who thinks that they're so pure and lofty that they make everybody else feel ashamed of themselves?

704
01:01:46,001 --> 01:01:49,440
Like who is really terribly prideful?

705
01:01:49,601 --> 01:01:50,800
Got to be a woman.

706
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,961
Yvonne is going to love her because she's his existential double.

707
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,440
It's Katerina Ivanovna.

708
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,681
And so you get this on 56.

709
01:01:59,681 --> 01:02:02,720
No, not 56, 62.

710
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,161
There's lots going on with her.

711
01:02:08,161 --> 01:02:14,161
She's just another bad, dangerous person who cons everybody into thinking she's a good person.

712
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,561
At the bottom of 62.

713
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,360
Oh, she at the bottom.

714
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:33,281
Oh, she is such a fine, and the other translation says lofty, which I think is better, and such a lofty, wonderful creature, if only for her suffering.

715
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:39,921
And then on the next page, or not really, the 64.

716
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,840
No, no, no.

717
01:02:46,161 --> 01:02:48,081
I've got to find more about herself.

718
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,921
Yvonne, how about 116?

719
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,161
No?

720
01:02:58,481 --> 01:03:00,001
I'm not doing one.

721
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:07,521
I think it's got to be then 120 and 121.

722
01:03:08,481 --> 01:03:11,081
Yes, bottom of 120.

723
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:15,481
I think Yvonne is talking now, but it doesn't matter who.

724
01:03:15,481 --> 01:03:17,720
She loves her own virtue, not me.

725
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:18,760
No, it's Dimitri.

726
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:22,440
The words broke involuntarily and maliciously from Dimitri.

727
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:23,561
He laughed.

728
01:03:23,561 --> 01:03:39,881
And he says, I swear, Alyasha, at the bottom of top of the next page, with intention anger at himself, as God is holy and Christ is God, I swear that though I smile at her lofty sentiments just now, there's the lofty, I know that I'm a million times baser in soul than she.

729
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:45,720
And I swear that those lofty sentiments of hers are as sincere as a heavenly angel's.

730
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:51,001
She's just like Yvonne is trying to be sort of better than everybody.

731
01:03:51,001 --> 01:03:57,320
So she's trying to be better than everybody and deny the dark side.

732
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:00,201
Okay, well, we've got just a little enough time to go on.

733
01:04:00,201 --> 01:04:01,240
We've got to do Dimitri.

734
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,560
That's the punchline for this lecture.

735
01:04:03,561 --> 01:04:05,641
So let's go on to Dimitri.

736
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:10,840
And because I also told you who the right double is, while that.

737
01:04:11,001 --> 01:04:11,400
Okay.

738
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:16,041
Dostoevsky creates a revealing scene when we first see Dimitri.

739
01:04:16,041 --> 01:04:17,800
And you presumably have mostly read that already.

740
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,441
How many have got up to page 75?

741
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:32,201
Okay, you recognize what that's going to be, but what you don't recognize until you read it a lot of times is the amazing way that Dostoevsky introduces Dimitri on page 75.

742
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:38,600
Dimitri, a young man of 28, of medium height, listen to this and see what's weird about this description as he comes in.

743
01:04:38,601 --> 01:04:41,161
An agreeable appearance, looked older than he was.

744
01:04:41,161 --> 01:04:45,321
He was muscular and strong, yet there was something not healthy about his face.

745
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,360
It was rather thin.

746
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,600
His cheeks were hollow and his complexion sallow.

747
01:04:48,601 --> 01:04:53,960
His large, prominent, dark eyes had an expression of determination, and yet there was a vague look in them, too.

748
01:04:54,320 --> 01:05:05,041
Even when he was excited and talking irritably, his eyes somehow did not follow his mood, but betrayed something else, something quite incongruous, which he was from what he was saying.

749
01:05:05,041 --> 01:05:16,401
It was hard to tell what he's thinking, and he said people who saw something pensive and sullen in his eyes were startled by the sudden laugh, which revealed light-hearted thoughts, while his eyes seemed so gloomy.

750
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,881
What is weird about that description?

751
01:05:20,001 --> 01:05:21,121
You hear it?

752
01:05:21,121 --> 01:05:23,681
It's just a whole bunch of contradictions.

753
01:05:23,681 --> 01:05:25,281
I wrote them down here.

754
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,800
He's young, but he looks old.

755
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:29,281
He's muscular, and yet he's unhealthy.

756
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:33,041
He seems to have firm determination, and yet he has a vague look in his eyes.

757
01:05:33,041 --> 01:05:36,481
He has a melancholy glance, but he bursts into laughter.

758
01:05:36,481 --> 01:05:40,561
And finally, at the end of the paragraph, you get the punchline.

759
01:05:40,561 --> 01:05:46,881
It's true, he was of excitable nature and then of an unstable and imbalanced mind.

760
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,481
Well, that's getting close.

761
01:05:48,481 --> 01:05:51,600
What he's got is his contradictory self.

762
01:05:51,601 --> 01:05:59,601
He's really revealing it in the way he looks and in the way he acts, in the way he thinks.

763
01:05:59,601 --> 01:06:10,801
He's got the insect versus angel, in his language, Sodom versus Madonna problem.

764
01:06:11,681 --> 01:06:17,601
Pull on on 112.

765
01:06:17,601 --> 01:06:23,681
And this is the contradictory self now, sort of right up front on 112 when he starts explaining it.

766
01:06:23,681 --> 01:06:25,680
And it's the Karamatsov self.

767
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:31,920
Now, the Karamatsovs are the most extreme version of the two sides that he sees.

768
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,760
Okay, here we go.

769
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,320
I'm that insect, Alyasha, and so forth and so forth.

770
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:43,240
Beauty's a terrible thing, and God sets us nothing with riddles.

771
01:06:39,121 --> 01:06:46,440
Here the boundaries meet, and all contradictions exist side by side.

772
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:53,081
Remember from Pascal on, the existentialists who got the idea that the self is a contradiction.

773
01:06:53,961 --> 01:06:55,480
So then let me skip a little.

774
01:06:55,480 --> 01:07:04,600
Beauty, I can't bear the thought of a man of lofty mind and heart begins with the ideal of Madonna and ends with the ideal of Sodom.

775
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,201
That's too easy.

776
01:07:06,201 --> 01:07:08,121
That's just a combination.

777
01:07:08,121 --> 01:07:09,961
What we want is something worse.

778
01:07:09,961 --> 01:07:11,640
The self is a synthesis.

779
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:14,280
The more Sodom, the more Madonna, and vice versa.

780
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,560
That's what he really thinks.

781
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:28,041
What is still more awful is that a man with the ideal of Sodom in his soul does not renounce the ideal of the Madonna, and in his soul, and in his heart may be on fire with that ideal, genuinely on fire, just as in the days of his youth.

782
01:07:28,041 --> 01:07:31,000
So they have them together.

783
01:07:31,001 --> 01:07:38,921
And then he says, yes, man is too broad, man meaning the self here, is broad, too broad.

784
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:40,600
I'd have him narrower.

785
01:07:40,921 --> 01:07:51,720
And then at the very last famous lines of that thing, God and the devil are fighting there, that is in the soul of man, and the battlefield is the heart of man, self.

786
01:07:51,721 --> 01:07:59,400
I mean, putting it in terms of God and the devil is getting it all wrong, because the two halves are equally important and valuable.

787
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:13,961
But the way Dimitri has set it up, he's named the dark side, the earth side, all kinds of bad names, insects, sodom, and so forth, and the heavenly side, all these good names, ain't Madonna.

788
01:08:13,961 --> 01:08:19,320
He's going to have to change that way of thinking, as he will, in the course of the book, in order to get them together.

789
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:22,041
If you're going to name them that way, you're never going to get them together.

790
01:08:22,041 --> 01:08:25,440
They're just going to exist in a continual conflict.

791
01:08:27,041 --> 01:08:34,640
And you will just keep flipping back and forth as he does, or as he says he does.

792
01:08:38,001 --> 01:08:40,081
Where is it when he's going down?

793
01:08:40,081 --> 01:08:52,240
Maybe he's where's the passionate heart heals up coming pretty soon.

794
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:55,440
Okay, here's we want to see that.

795
01:08:55,440 --> 01:09:01,600
Because at the moment that he's going down into the depths, he's also singing a hinge of praise to God.

796
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:02,081
I don't know.

797
01:09:02,081 --> 01:09:05,201
I can't probably find that quote because I wasn't planning to read it.

798
01:09:05,201 --> 01:09:07,280
So I'll start with it next time.

799
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:12,880
But I do want to read one more thing, just a second.

800
01:09:16,081 --> 01:09:20,640
It should be very near here that when he's going in head first, we should be able to find it.

801
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:27,041
At the very moment that he's going most into sensuality and lust, he begins to sing a praise to God.

802
01:09:27,841 --> 01:09:29,840
Come on, let's find that.

803
01:09:32,081 --> 01:09:33,760
When everybody finds it, yeah.

804
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:43,201
I think it's the middle of 1/11.

805
01:09:43,201 --> 01:09:51,600
And whenever I've happened to the vilest degradation, and it's happening, I always read the poem and such and such.

806
01:09:51,600 --> 01:10:14,600
For when I leap into the pit, and I'm pleased to be falling and pride myself on it, I begin a hymn of these two.

807
01:10:15,001 --> 01:10:16,041
Why this funny one?

808
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:17,801
You didn't hear the quote.

809
01:10:18,761 --> 01:10:19,320
Yeah, I know.

810
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:21,081
That's what I, that is not funny.

811
01:10:21,081 --> 01:10:23,320
So you couldn't.

812
01:10:23,961 --> 01:10:24,921
You couldn't hear me.

813
01:10:24,921 --> 01:10:29,161
Now, I'm not sure that I'm going on an office that I'm looking up and looking down.

814
01:10:29,161 --> 01:10:31,960
But anyway, did you hear me read the quote?

815
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:33,320
What?

816
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:34,600
Read it again.

817
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:37,161
Okay, here I am in the middle of 111.

818
01:10:37,801 --> 01:10:46,520
And whenever I've happened to sink into the vilest degradation, and it's always been happening, I always read the poem about Ceres and man and so forth.

819
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:47,320
Never mind that.

820
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,240
For I'm a Karamatsov.

821
01:10:49,801 --> 01:10:53,480
So it's a name for this self that just contradictory and too broad.

822
01:10:53,480 --> 01:11:00,201
But when I do leap into the pit, I go headlong with my heels up, and I'm pleased to be falling and pride myself on it.

823
01:11:00,201 --> 01:11:07,081
And very depth of degradation, I begin a hymn of praise.

824
01:11:07,081 --> 01:11:13,400
Let me be accursed, let me be vile and base, only let me kiss the helm of the veil in which my God is shrouded.

825
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:21,240
Though I may be following the devil, I am thy son, O Lord, and I feel the joy without which the world cannot stand.

826
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:33,400
And then we might as well, where's the so where there are the and so we've got this at the top of 112, this combination to angels' visions of God's throne to insects' sensual lust.

827
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:36,360
And then he says, I am that insect.

828
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:38,680
Alyasha.

829
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:41,161
And instead of the Karamatsovs that there are such insects.

830
01:11:41,161 --> 01:11:41,961
Let's read all of that.

831
01:11:41,961 --> 01:11:43,480
I finally found the important part.

832
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:44,360
112.

833
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:47,560
And angel as you are, that insect lives in you too.

834
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:50,520
And we're going to hear more about that when we get to Alyasha next time.

835
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,880
He's the sensualist, too, it turns out.

836
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:56,880
And will stir up a tempest in your soul.

837
01:11:57,201 --> 01:12:02,480
Tempest because central lust is worse than a tempest and so forth.

838
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:07,121
Here the boundaries meet, and all contradictions exist side by side.

839
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,520
That's the missing piece I wanted to read.

840
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:13,600
And now there's only just time to do one very quick, simple thing.

841
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,840
Who's the existential devil?

842
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,161
Oh, oh, no, there are two important things.

843
01:12:20,161 --> 01:12:21,041
We have time for that.

844
01:12:21,041 --> 01:12:41,440
On 81, it turns out this amazing move, that knowing that Dimitri is the one who's got this problem of the self in the most extreme form and is trying to deal with it and can't, who gets the final award, so to speak, of all the confessions in Zasima's cell?

845
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:58,001
Dimitri turns out to be the one who Zastama thinks is, so to speak, living as best you can on your own, anyway, the complications, the contradictions of being a human being.

846
01:12:58,001 --> 01:13:05,280
So on 81, two-thirds of the way down, the scene was suddenly cut short in the most unexpected way.

847
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:09,840
Father Zosima rose from his seat, almost distracted with anxiety for the elder.

848
01:13:09,841 --> 01:13:15,600
Alyasha rushed to support Alyasha supported him by the arm, always involved, of course.

849
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,840
Ivan would have been just watching.

850
01:13:17,841 --> 01:13:22,081
Father Zosima moves toward Dimitri, reached him, sank on his knees before him.

851
01:13:22,081 --> 01:13:25,520
Alyasha thought that he'd fallen from weakness, but that was not so.

852
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:31,041
The elder distinctly and deliberately bowed down at Dmitri's feet until his forehead touched the floor.

853
01:13:31,041 --> 01:13:35,760
Alyasha was so astonished that he failed to help him up when he got up again.

854
01:13:36,881 --> 01:13:39,001
Goodbye, forgive me, and so forth.

855
01:13:39,001 --> 01:13:39,801
Asima leaves.

856
01:13:39,801 --> 01:13:41,081
Well, that's a puzzle.

857
01:13:41,081 --> 01:13:41,640
Left.

858
01:13:38,801 --> 01:13:44,600
It doesn't get explained, but later it gets explained.

859
01:13:45,001 --> 01:13:51,720
Zasima says he bowed down to Dimitri in appreciation of the great suffering in store for him.

860
01:13:51,721 --> 01:13:58,680
Because Dimitri isn't hiding the self as old Karamatsov, and he isn't trying to get rid of half of the self like Yvonne.

861
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:04,680
He's trying on his own, that's the positive R2, to get himself together.

862
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:10,840
And he has to, and he can't, and that's the suffering in store for him, part of it anyway.

863
01:14:10,841 --> 01:14:12,280
Now, who's the double?

864
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,800
Well, you've no reason why you should know.

865
01:14:13,801 --> 01:14:17,320
It doesn't happen until way later in the book, on 422.

866
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:20,360
But you ought to know, because who's Yvonne's girlfriend?

867
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:21,960
Don't you even know that yet?

868
01:14:21,961 --> 01:14:23,240
Grushenka.

869
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:29,161
And of course, if it's Grushenka, then Dosteski's going to give you the existential doubles talk, so to speak.

870
01:14:29,161 --> 01:14:31,720
Here we are on 422.

871
01:14:32,041 --> 01:14:39,400
They have this big party and they get drunk, and she says, a little below the middle, I'm a beast, that's what I am, but I want to pray.

872
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:40,760
Sound familiar?

873
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:43,001
And then skip the onion, we don't know that.

874
01:14:43,001 --> 01:14:45,240
Wicked as I've been, I want to pray.

875
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,680
Dimitri, let them dance.

876
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,280
Everyone in the world is good.

877
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:49,880
Everyone, even the worst of them.

878
01:14:49,881 --> 01:14:51,480
The world's a nice place.

879
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,400
We're bad, and the world's all right.

880
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,560
We're good and bad, good and bad.

881
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:58,760
See, that's her simple version of this.

882
01:14:59,081 --> 01:15:05,800
It's on the chart as on the one side, the beasts, on the other side, the prayer, on one side, the bad, the other side, the good.

883
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:11,880
She's got exactly Dimitri's understanding of the factors, and she's got his problem.

884
01:15:11,881 --> 01:15:16,121
And we have to see they'll both deal with it in the same way eventually.

885
01:15:16,121 --> 01:15:17,081
Okay.

886
01:15:22,201 --> 01:15:23,161
What happened there?

887
01:15:23,161 --> 01:15:24,201
Why did I lose time?
