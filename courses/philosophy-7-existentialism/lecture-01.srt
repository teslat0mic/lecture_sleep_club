00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,679
This is called a philosophy course, but it's not like any other philosophy course in the department, or any philosophy department probably.

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,960
But that's all right.

3
00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:14,800
In fact, it's necessary.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,559
The existentialists, as I'll explain as I go on, don't really consider themselves philosophers.

5
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:22,720
They are sort of anti-philosophers.

6
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:28,240
So what they're going to do is certainly going to look very different than what philosophers do.

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:45,600
Philosophers try to find the argument in the text they're reading and the reasons that the philosopher writing the text has for believing that what he's claiming is or she is claiming is true and then see if you're convinced by those reasons.

8
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:47,520
All of that is very different.

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:01:02,960
People like Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky and Nietzsche write out of some experience, some extremely important experience for them, out of which they understand really what human beings are and what life is all about.

10
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:07,120
And they can't justify that experience or argue for it.

11
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,240
They can show you the way the world looks to somebody who's had that experience.

12
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,840
And our job then isn't to find their arguments and to see if they're sound and true.

13
00:01:17,839 --> 00:01:30,240
Our job is to find this fundamental revelation that's behind each of these books and see how all the things that the author says follow from it.

14
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,599
But that means that you won't find that in any other philosophy course.

15
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:45,320
That's just that, and I tell you this just because I hope you want to go on in philosophy, but you mustn't go on in philosophy expecting that there are going to be any other philosophy course like this.

16
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,080
And it's philosophy exciting and different.

17
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,000
But for me, this is very interesting and important.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,520
And the wonderful thing about philosophy is you can do anything.

19
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,800
You can think about anything.

20
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,600
You could do the philosophy of film or physics.

21
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:03,000
You can do existential philosophy.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,319
And it all counts in a departmental way.

23
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,040
This is different.

24
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,040
I mean, there's a way of doing philosophy.

25
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:16,280
I am not going to contradict myself, which is giving arguments and defending them.

26
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:23,079
But there is a kind of rubric, a kind of name for our department, where anything goes.

27
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:29,640
And that also is true, that philosophy is thinking about anything.

28
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:32,759
And so you'll find lots of other interesting things in the department.

29
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:40,040
You just won't find people thinking about some fundamental revealing experience that they've had.

30
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:41,800
Let's see now.

31
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,679
Oh, yeah.

32
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:53,400
Okay, one, you've got this revealing experience.

33
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:20,920
Two, existential thinkers believe that a person's understanding of themselves and their world is too embodied and pervasive, and the background of all their experience such that they can never present it fully and explicitly like a system or like a set of propositions which express what they believe or describe what they've experienced.

34
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:38,480
The equivalent of that is that what it is to be masculine or feminine, for instance, in a culture, is so built into the way people stand and the way people walk and who gets to look who in the eyes and who gets to enter what sort of conversations and whether you can throw a baseball and so forth.

35
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:44,080
It gets so pervasive and so embodied that you can't get clear about it.

36
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,400
You can get somewhat clear about it.

37
00:03:46,400 --> 00:04:01,040
There used to be consciousness raising when I first came out to Berkeley, where first women and then men too, and each in their own groups, met to try to get clear about what it is to be gender, masculine or feminine in our culture.

38
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,520
But then they sort of, I think, don't exist much anymore, if I'm not mistaken.

39
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:11,200
And my only interpretation can't be because people figured it out now and they don't have to do it anymore.

40
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:27,360
I think they became, I think, if I were doing it, I think they would come to understand that what it is is so deep and so pervasive that it helps to know some of these things that you can describe, but the most important, you can't just articulate.

41
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:35,679
And that's another aspect of why these existential writers don't try to do philosophy.

42
00:04:35,679 --> 00:05:01,999
They understand that they can tell you, describe to you the world of a person who's had this experience and who's living in a certain way without telling you in propositions the person believes this and this and this, because it doesn't much matter what they believe any more than it matters much to understand masculine and feminine by understanding, going around and taking a poll about what men believe and women believe.

43
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,240
It's what they're getting at is deeper.

44
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,840
You can't tell it.

45
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,280
You've got to show it.

46
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:17,400
Kierkegaard has a whole theory about this, which he calls indirect communication, in which he doesn't write in his own name most of the time.

47
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:22,840
And the oddest thing of all, but I can't go into it, but this is where Alistair Henney goes is wrong, and lots of people.

48
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:32,520
When Kierkegaard does write in his own name, he presents and defends an experience and a view which isn't his, and which he thinks is wrong and leads to despair.

49
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:38,600
It's when he's writing under other names that he tells you what he really feels.

50
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:43,480
And this book is written by Johannes de Salentio, not by Kierkegaard.

51
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:49,560
I mean, in this pseudonym version, Kierkegaard claims just to be, I think, the editor of it.

52
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:51,400
I forget what he says he is.

53
00:05:51,400 --> 00:06:11,800
But in any case, he's writing from a point of view which he thinks he can't express to you directly and explicitly, but show you, again, how the world looks to somebody who's had this kind of overwhelming experience that he's.

54
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:17,079
Let's see now.

55
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:24,280
So, and just to tell you roughly, Kierkegaard's experience is romantic love.

56
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:33,239
It's the total commitment and devotion of a lad for the princess, as he puts it, or the knight for the princess.

57
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,679
It comes out, we'll go back to this.

58
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:37,240
It comes out of chivalric romances.

59
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:52,200
But what's such a genius, Kierkegaard is such a genius that he turns this sort of fright and you think already used up experience into a whole new way of understanding human beings and the world.

60
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,560
That's what he's doing in Fear and Trembling.

61
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:10,880
And Dostoevsky has also a kind of seemingly tried experience, namely what's called agape love or charity, Christian love of your neighbor, which is again one would think sort of talked about so much and that it's kind of used up.

62
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,240
But Dostoevsky has a whole new take on what it is to experience that.

63
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:21,839
And then Nietzsche has an experience so special that we don't have any normal name for it.

64
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:24,319
He had to give it his own name for it.

65
00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:27,280
He experiences the death of God.

66
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:37,280
And he claims to be the first one to have seen that the Western God is dead and draw the conclusions from that.

67
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,160
And so you'll see all this more when we get into the particular experiences.

68
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:47,280
Oh, I wrote down here, but I didn't say it.

69
00:07:47,280 --> 00:08:06,879
This idea that what these people are trying to say is so close to them and so pervasive in their world and so embodied in everything they see and do that they can't just say it is something Yeats, in the last, one of the last things he did, a letter he wrote, says, he says, man can embody truth but cannot know it.

70
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:15,919
And that's sort of what I think all these people have in common and why they write the kind of things they write.

71
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,680
Anyone want to say anything about that?

72
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,760
Because that's my first statement, just what's peculiar about what we're reading.

73
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,879
And go ahead.

74
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:49,159
Because I remember in one interception, I don't think one of them, and then there was some one how to go by about whether one can evolve in a mankind without talking in the neighborhood.

75
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:59,800
I mean, Ivan and the 1715, you know, I won't I won't say anything about that yet.

76
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:07,879
Save it till we get to the brothers, because if we talk about it now, you've read it, but there's a lot of people who haven't read it, and we'll lose them if we talk about it.

77
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:08,839
Yeah.

78
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:12,359
Ah, okay.

79
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:14,280
That's a terrific question.

80
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,119
In fact, that's next on my list.

81
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:17,719
You're the perfect straight person.

82
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,280
It says, why not read the usual existentialists, for example, Sartre?

83
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:25,959
Okay, there's a long story to be told about that.

84
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:32,760
Sartre is the last of a whole series of existential thinkers.

85
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:39,399
And in a certain way, he's the most derivative and the least radical.

86
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:49,800
But to tell you where he fits in and why we don't read him, I will sort of give you a list of existential thinkers so you can see why.

87
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,359
I mean, Sartre, this won't mean much to you, I'm afraid, to say this, but I'll say it.

88
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,160
Sartre takes the, well, no, I won't say it yet, anyway.

89
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,360
I'll say it in a minute.

90
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:02,359
It won't give me even less if I say it.

91
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:05,479
So there's Pascal.

92
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,599
He's the first.

93
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:22,119
In 1650, Pascal, who's a generation after Descartes, goes sort of totally head-to-head against Descartes, who is the philosopher's philosopher.

94
00:10:22,119 --> 00:10:32,880
After Plato, there's probably no philosopher as important as Descartes for giving us in the West a certain understanding of what we are.

95
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,639
So this is Pascal is anti Descartes.

96
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:46,960
For Descartes has a whole lot of views that are characteristic of philosophers, which I'll tell you about in a minute.

97
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:49,280
I can't joke in and say it yet.

98
00:10:49,280 --> 00:11:01,119
But Descartes stands for something like looking at everything from a detached, disembodied, theoretical, reflective perspective.

99
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:26,319
And Pascal thinks that you don't find out important things about human beings that way and says amazing things that way ahead of his time, like that we never have an experience of God, that God is always hidden, and therefore you have to believe in God by a kind of leap.

100
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:32,639
And these are things that became sort of Kierkegaard for one, and Dostoevsky, too, are very influenced by Pascal.

101
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:38,959
Another thing Pascal said, I'll come back to, is a very existentialist thing, is custom is our nature.

102
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,280
That is, there's no human nature.

103
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:51,119
We give ourselves the nature that our culture has made up, so to speak, for interpreting human beings, and a million other important things.

104
00:11:51,119 --> 00:11:57,600
So there's Pascal, and then after Pascal, sort of standing on his shoulders, is Tierkegaard.

105
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:05,520
Interestingly enough, nothing much happens with Pascal for, what is it, 300 years or 200 years?

106
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,719
200 years.

107
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:17,479
And then Kierkegaard takes it up and, for instance, explains a lot about what he thinks is wrong with the philosophical detached point of view.

108
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,399
Kierkegaard is anti-Hegel.

109
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,159
Existentialists are always anti-some philosopher.

110
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:31,559
They can't really think philosophically without, think existentially without having some philosopher to be against.

111
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:42,280
And after Kierkegaard standing on sort of not on Kierkegaard's shoulders, but sort of doing things on his own, I guess I should have put that so I could put it up there.

112
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:49,000
But now I can't put it up there, so I'll go overhead.

113
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,959
Okay, after Kierkegaard, and then another hundred years, almost.

114
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,960
Oh, well, no, sorry, we got another one in there.

115
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,760
Okay.

116
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:04,920
So then there's Nietzsche, which I could spell.

117
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,159
E-T-Z-S-C-A-G, which is probably more than most of you can do.

118
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,639
But it's taken me years.

119
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,479
I hope I got it right.

120
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,760
Let's see.

121
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,319
1886.

122
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:18,839
And I don't know.

123
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,719
I'm trying to think, who's Nietzsche's great enemy?

124
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,280
Who's he writing against?

125
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,599
Wagner is sort of, yeah, but that's right.

126
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,559
And that's a kind of, but there was a kind of, that's not philosophical enough.

127
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:35,800
Who was his enemy philosopher?

128
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:39,640
Schopenhauer is tied up with the Wagner thing.

129
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:40,440
There isn't any.

130
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:40,920
One.

131
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:42,839
He's against all of them.

132
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:46,839
And of course, and Plato and Socrates and so forth.

133
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,520
I think maybe his biggest enemy is, in a way, Socrates.

134
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:58,559
We're going to read the part where he says that Socrates is a degenerate that is undermined and ruined Greek culture and us and everything.

135
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:01,679
I guess if it has to be anybody, it's Socrates.

136
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:11,760
But I don't know any place where, I mean, he has plenty to say against Wagner, but that's a sort of a more kind of an inner wobble.

137
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:28,719
Okay, then after that, Heidegger, who I teach several courses on, because he's the one who made Kierkegaard into a kind of philosophical system, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche.

138
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:40,079
He draws them together, he puts them into something like philosophical language, but it's anti-philosophy, but it's anti-philosophy much more in a philosophical form.

139
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,719
Heidegger's main book is 1927, Being and Time.

140
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,319
And then, finally, Sartre.

141
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,800
So we've got over here Being in Time.

142
00:14:52,800 --> 00:15:04,800
Sartre, while he's a prisoner of war in Germany, writes and writes and then publishes at the end of the war in 1945, Being and Nothingness.

143
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,559
Now I can book yourself in covering Zero.

144
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,839
There we go.

145
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:14,879
Oh, no, that's me.

146
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:19,280
Okay, so now I'm still coming back to your question.

147
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,679
Sartre is at the end of all this.

148
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:29,119
He hasn't got much that they haven't said already, and that's bad enough, enough reason for not reading it, though.

149
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:31,360
He has great examples for what he's doing.

150
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:36,319
He's very good at describing cases that support he's doing.

151
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:44,919
The real trouble with Sartre is that he, being French, can't help but live inside of the thinking of Descartes.

152
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:51,959
So that what he does is take Heidegger and write Heidegger in a way that you could write Heidegger and still be a Cartesian.

153
00:15:51,960 --> 00:16:00,440
And that's disastrous because Heidegger's big enemy, I didn't write him on there, is, well, Husserl and Descartes.

154
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,719
I won't write them up there.

155
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:09,639
But anyway, so Sartre is the most derivative and the least radical of the people of the philosophers.

156
00:16:10,599 --> 00:16:14,599
And okay, that's my answer to why Sartre.

157
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,119
Is there somebody else you think, wonder why he's not in here?

158
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,159
Nobody's going to come to the defense of Camus.

159
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:25,319
I mean, the other person, yeah.

160
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:34,040
Simone de Beauvoir is interesting, but she's very close to Sartre.

161
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:41,399
I mean, they've got a view that they, you know, they naturally have a lot in common, having talked to each other for a long time.

162
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:51,000
And Simone de Beauvoir is interesting, and she's interesting, particularly as a feminist, early on, but not at the level of these people.

163
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,839
Yeah.

164
00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:07,319
No, again, I don't know much Unamuno, but I have a feeling that he hasn't got anything really new to say that these big deal people haven't already said.

165
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:09,399
No, let me just talk about Camus.

166
00:17:09,399 --> 00:17:09,959
I'm just amazed.

167
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,639
Don't you read The Stranger still?

168
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:13,159
How many read The Stranger?

169
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,200
You know, you see.

170
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,839
Okay.

171
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:18,679
And how many were told that this is existentialism?

172
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,559
Okay.

173
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,079
Well, then I better deal with it.

174
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,599
Why not more Camus?

175
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,360
Why not the plague or the fall?

176
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,239
Maybe you read that too.

177
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,679
How many read The Plague?

178
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,559
How many read The Fall?

179
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,000
Less, probably.

180
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:31,840
Okay, well, you read a lot of Camus.

181
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:34,960
Why am I just ignoring him?

182
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,879
Well, it's because Canu isn't an existentialist, in spite of what people may have told you.

183
00:17:40,879 --> 00:17:43,760
And of course, that depends on how you define it.

184
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,839
But Camus says he isn't.

185
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,520
He says he's a pagan.

186
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,800
I think that's right.

187
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:55,040
That is, I think all the existentialists are within the Judeo-Christian tradition.

188
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,919
I'll explain that and why I say that in a minute.

189
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:06,480
But they believe in a God who's the supreme being who, sorry, I haven't said that right.

190
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,639
No, the existentialists don't believe that.

191
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:32,079
They are in opposition to a culture that has as one of its fundamental beliefs that there is a supreme being that makes everything intelligible, that gives moral law, and thanks to the supreme being, we can find out what to do and everything will make sense and not be contradictory and so forth.

192
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:36,239
And the culture lived off that for a long time.

193
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,639
But Canu, and we can call that the absolute, this absolute source of meaning, absolute authority.

194
00:18:42,639 --> 00:18:46,800
You can count on it to make sense of the world and make sense of your life.

195
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,559
Now, Canu certainly denies there is any such absolute.

196
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,360
You see it in the street in The Stranger and in The Plague.

197
00:18:53,359 --> 00:19:00,079
I mean, he's definitely against the whole Judeo-Christian tradition.

198
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:06,159
But he thinks that the way you should fix it is just get over the problem of seeking an absolute.

199
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,040
So reduce your demands.

200
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,079
Why should we think that there's going to be that kind of answer?

201
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,079
Why should we need that kind of answer?

202
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:28,040
Can't we just appreciate the little things lie on the beach in Algeria, and as at the end of The Stranger, appreciate all the way the world is, even though you're going to die?

203
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,319
And that's fine.

204
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:34,360
But that's not an existential, that's a kind of pre-Christian attitude.

205
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:36,280
That's why he says he's a pagan.

206
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:44,599
People could live like the stranger learned to live at the end of the book in any culture, any culture but our culture.

207
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:52,520
Because our culture has gotten addicted, Nietzsche would say, we're sort of absolute junkies.

208
00:19:52,520 --> 00:20:01,559
That is, we've gotten so used to understanding everything in terms of a supreme being and creation and so forth that you can't just get over it.

209
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:06,040
Camus' idea is you just get over it.

210
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:12,520
You stop expecting the kind of answer that we thought we've had for 2,000 years.

211
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,479
And that's pre-Christian, as I say.

212
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:21,399
And it's impossible to take it seriously now, I think.

213
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:50,599
Or at least it would be impossible for Kierkegaard or Dostoevsky or Sartre or Heidegger to take it seriously now because they all think that though it turns out there isn't any such absolute, we have become defined in terms of the need for it, because once we thought we had it and it gave us this amazing world in which everything made sense and we knew what to do, and we knew that virtue was rewarded and vice was punished and so forth.

214
00:20:50,599 --> 00:21:03,360
Once you've lived in a world like that, like the medievals did, it's something that Nietzsche thinks anyway we haven't got over yet, not until he comes along and understands that that God is dead.

215
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:17,199
But when Nietzsche says God is dead, you'll see, unlike Camus, he thinks that it is the most disastrous and frightening and terrible thing you could possibly experience and discover.

216
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,919
Because he's not a pre-Christian, a pagan, he's a post-Christian.

217
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:28,319
He's somebody writing after we got hooked on this absolute supreme being.

218
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:36,559
Anyway, that's why Camus isn't in the Course, because I think he wouldn't think about it the way Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, and Nietzsche do.

219
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:44,719
That the most serious thing we have to deal with is that the supreme being, kind of absolute, doesn't exist anymore.

220
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:52,639
And Kierkegaard has his own new absolute that's going to take the place of the traditional sort of God.

221
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:54,319
We'll find out what that is.

222
00:21:54,319 --> 00:22:06,399
And he thinks it's still somehow, the real truth of Christianity, the real truth, Christianity got messed up by too much Plato, and Kierkegaard will tell us what the Christians were, Jews were really up to.

223
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:14,880
And Dostoevsky also doesn't believe in a supreme being, but thinks he's saved what's really important in the Judeo-Christian message.

224
00:22:14,879 --> 00:22:16,719
These are what post-Christians do.

225
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,639
And then Nietzsche thinks there's nothing worth saving, that the hardest thing is to get over.

226
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,719
It would be, I mean, Nietzsche's closer to Camus, or Camus closer to Nietzsche.

227
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:33,760
Janietzsche thinks the real challenge is to get over any version of the Judeo-Christian tradition.

228
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,960
It's all sin.

229
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,399
It's all wrong.

230
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:40,520
But he certainly takes it seriously.

231
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,639
And he thinks it's very, very, very hard to get over it.

232
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,160
And nobody's over it yet.

233
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:56,359
Okay, so that's sort of putting these people now, the existentialists, into the why the ones they're in are in and why the ones that are out are not.

234
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,119
Okay, now for the rest of the 12.

235
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:11,079
Comments on that.

236
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:18,199
Again, you don't have to comment on these things, but if somebody is wanting to say something, then this is, you should raise your hand and say it.

237
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:26,280
It's not, I mean, the kind of thing to discuss exactly, because until you've read the book, it's hard to have a discussion.

238
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,000
That's why, let me put in a plug for this right now.

239
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,559
It's very important to do the reading before we've got to do the lectures on it.

240
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:36,839
Then you can, first you can understand what I'm saying.

241
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:43,399
You can understand how hard it is and how amazing it is that I could say anything at all about these people and that you can too.

242
00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:52,919
And then you can go back and reread after you've heard the lectures, after you've been in the discussion section, and then you'll see a lot more and can write your paper.

243
00:23:52,919 --> 00:24:03,719
But if you come in without having read it, you're just wasting your time, and you're also getting brainwashed by me, so that when you finally do read it, you see it with my footprints all over it.

244
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,520
And the point is to have your own fresh response.

245
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:15,479
I've learned a huge amount over the last, I don't know, what, 25 years or whatever, teaching this course and other courses from students who see things.

246
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,439
So, students in this course who see things, big, important things that I didn't see.

247
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,000
And I'm sure there's still many, many things to see.

248
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:32,879
And I'm also sure that seeing them without having had any other philosophy courses is a great advantage because you haven't got blinders on.

249
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:38,319
And so come and read it, and we'll learn from each other.

250
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:45,040
Now, I'm ready to tell you next what I think existential thinking is.

251
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:56,719
And that's got to be, you've got to know that because Kierkegaard fits into this picture as the, well, he says, Kierkegaard, that he's the first existential thinker.

252
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,439
And Pascal had lots of the pieces.

253
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,720
And the Kierkegaard's got a worked-out view of what it is to be an existential thinker.

254
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,800
So we have to find out what that could mean.

255
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,719
I saw a hand up back there.

256
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,559
Well, no, I haven't.

257
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,679
I mean, somebody should.

258
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,839
But one, I don't know enough about it then.

259
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:22,479
But mostly, this is a course in existentialism and literature and film.

260
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:31,280
And one thing for sure is that Eastern philosophers are utterly different than existentialists or Western philosophers.

261
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,719
I don't think Eastern thinkers should be called philosophers.

262
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,160
They're all thinkers.

263
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:43,599
So, and it's really unfortunate we don't have more courses in the, for instance, Buddhism.

264
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,160
Buddhism is interesting because I think it's closest to philosophy.

265
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:55,359
My son has just become a super devoted Buddhist, and every time I talk to him, it's so close to Plato.

266
00:25:55,359 --> 00:26:09,280
And Plato went off and studied some weird stuff for a while called the mystery religions and came back with views like the reincarnation of souls, which he didn't have before.

267
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,000
So I think there is some Buddhism in the philosophy side.

268
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:17,960
But remember, the philosophy side is the side the existentialists are against.

269
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:33,960
So I'll try to just, given that my son has been giving me lectures on Buddhism day and night for the last few months, I will try to put in bits of this is Tibet, bits of Tibetan Buddhism where it relates to what philosophers say.

270
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,880
I may do it all badly.

271
00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:40,280
My son would probably not approve, but I'll see if I can bring any in.

272
00:26:40,280 --> 00:27:02,359
Okay, now, we're going to talk about first, well, let's put it, since the existentialists define themselves in opposition to the philosophy tradition, we've got to find out what the essence of traditional philosophy is from the point of view of these existentialist thinkers.

273
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:12,839
And they all think that the essence of philosophy got settled by Socrates and Plato in Athens in, what, 300 BC, roughly?

274
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:13,240
No.

275
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:14,680
I'm very bad with it.

276
00:27:14,999 --> 00:27:17,319
I can't spell, and I don't know any dates either.

277
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:18,679
But here we go.

278
00:27:18,999 --> 00:27:33,159
So I'm going to try to tell you in condensed form what philosophy is and what existential people have against it by dividing philosophy up into three categories.

279
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:38,280
We're going to talk about theory of knowledge.

280
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:55,280
Let's take this theory of knowledge.

281
00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:01,839
If you want to drop fancy talk after this lecture, you can call this epistemology.

282
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:11,520
And so that's what we call it with the Leading Philosophy course, this emphology, which means theory of knowledge.

283
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:17,760
And then there's ethics, and there's metaphysics.

284
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:33,999
I'm going to tell you in condensed form what philosophers have to say about these three categories, and then I'm going to tell you what existentialists have to say about what philosophers have to say about these three.

285
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:35,680
So knowledge.

286
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,120
What's knowledge?

287
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,920
Well, Plato was absolutely blown away by theory.

288
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:44,959
They discovered theory, these Greeks.

289
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:47,280
I mean, the Egyptians didn't have theory.

290
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,800
They were very sophisticated.

291
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,159
They made beautiful things.

292
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,120
And they had writing and they had gods, but they didn't have theory.

293
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,720
Theory is...

294
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,959
Plato found it, he thought, in math and in medicine.

295
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:06,319
He was particularly impressed with what he thought doctors knew, strangely enough.

296
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:14,319
But they supposedly had an understanding of the human body and of disease, and math had an understanding of these eternal forms.

297
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:34,400
Theory gets you that universal, timeless truths by either using reason, like in math, or by discovering the ultimate nature of, for instance, human bodies, and then you have medicine.

298
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:51,960
And the idea that you could have these universal truths, which everyone all over would have to believe and accept once they saw the arguments for them, was absolutely amazing to Plato.

299
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:54,519
It was the greatest thing since fire and the wheel.

300
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:57,080
It probably is the greatest thing.

301
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,959
And how do you get theory?

302
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:05,240
Well, you become a disinterested, objective observer.

303
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,720
And so that you can discover what's true for all rational beings.

304
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,440
And if you do it right, then everybody will see what you see.

305
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:17,639
And again, their math is a much better example of this than medicine.

306
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,760
So let's stick to math.

307
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:29,879
I mean, if you get a truth about triangles by disinterested, objective inquiry, then it's going to be true for everybody for all times.

308
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:48,040
And it turns out now that we believe, and it's still part of the Greek story, though Plato didn't have it yet, and natural science is theory, because scientists also take a totally disinterested, objective attitude toward what they study.

309
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:58,920
They don't get any points for whether people like their conclusions or not, or whether it will do well for getting a Nobel Prize or not.

310
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:00,680
That's not what it's about.

311
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:10,280
What's it about is finding out these universal relations between whatever that you're studying.

312
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:19,240
And then that will give you, Plato already thought, deep understanding and predictive power.

313
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:37,440
That's interesting because he sort of already understood he had a place for physics, and he had a place for astronomy, and he had an understanding that if you understood the theory of these things, like medicine, you could predict what was going to happen to the Earth and to people.

314
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,280
So there you get.

315
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:46,319
So science gives you, as a philosopher Thomas Nagel says, a view from nowhere.

316
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:52,960
And theory is what you get when you get so detached that you can have a view from nowhere.

317
00:31:52,959 --> 00:32:13,280
Descartes, when he went to do philosophy and theory, got in winter, retired to a warm room, he said, where he had no passions bothering him and presumably no commitments to do anything and contemplated these eternal truths and structures.

318
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,280
Okay, what happens in morality?

319
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:25,440
Well, this kind of morality finds out what I skipped a page.

320
00:32:25,439 --> 00:32:27,200
No wonder it doesn't make any sense.

321
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,760
Okay, so I should say one more thing about theory.

322
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,359
It's great to discover theory, but you have to lose a lot.

323
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:40,719
And you may have noticed, or maybe you didn't, well, how much you lose.

324
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,839
Partly, you don't notice it much, because here at the university, everybody's dedicated to theory.

325
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:53,760
And what's left out is perception, because you use your mind, not your eyes.

326
00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:00,879
Skill, you're not supposed to have to have any particular sort of bodily kind of skills.

327
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:04,879
There's a kind of mental thing, but I'm not, let's not call that skill.

328
00:33:04,879 --> 00:33:10,919
I mean, I'm just calling skill the way you cope with everyday stuff that you use and so forth.

329
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:13,319
Intuition, it's not fair to have intuition.

330
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:16,439
I mean, you can have intuition, but it's not theory.

331
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:23,159
It's not something that everybody has to believe until you can put it into language and argue for it.

332
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,959
Gets rid of emotions, the body, tradition.

333
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:32,039
That's one of the big things that Kierkegaard.

334
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,080
Kierkegaard's PhD thesis was on Socrates.

335
00:33:35,240 --> 00:34:00,520
What he thought about Socrates was that Socrates had this theoretical, critical attitude that undermined the tradition, and that the Athenians were probably right in at least banishing him, if not putting him to death, because it was totally disastrous to try to ground the faulture on these rational, detached, universal principles.

336
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:06,439
Every culture has its tradition, but theory hasn't any place for that.

337
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:11,240
Plato, how many read The Republican School anywhere already?

338
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:16,280
I mean, theory is getting out of the cave, to talk Plato, term language.

339
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:24,119
In the cave, there is intuition and bodies and emotions and perspective on things and so forth.

340
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:30,920
When you get out of the cave, you see things as they really are, and that is the way theory sees them.

341
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:33,000
Okay, now we get to ethics.

342
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:35,240
So, how do you, what do you do when you get to ethics?

343
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,920
Well, you do the same thing.

344
00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:44,920
You get beyond individual personal perspectives and preferences and prejudices and desires.

345
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:51,880
You want to find the universal good again, the highest good for everybody.

346
00:34:52,200 --> 00:35:00,640
And either those will be universal rules of right action, which Socrates was looking for in the Euthyphro.

347
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:06,080
He wanted a rule for recognizing what was the pious, that is, right thing to do.

348
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:14,480
And Plato wanted to find out what all human beings really need and then how to act in order to get it.

349
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:18,319
That's what the Republic is telling you.

350
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:40,720
And it will follow from this that any really moral person who did understand what all human beings needed and understood the universal rules for getting it, for acting rightly and having a good life, well, then everybody would behave the same way in the same situation.

351
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:48,319
I mean, insofar as there are the same situations, it's again like when you discover truths in theory, they're true for everybody everywhere.

352
00:35:48,319 --> 00:35:54,640
When you discover what human beings really need and what they should do to get it, it's true for everybody everywhere.

353
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:00,800
And therefore, everybody will, in principle, do the same.

354
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:21,839
Everybody who's moral, who understands what Plato is trying to tell them about what they really need and how to get it, will do what anybody else would do in that situation, what they're in, and they'll be intelligible to all other moral men and women.

355
00:36:22,479 --> 00:36:24,640
People are not.

356
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,359
Being an individual is not important.

357
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,880
Getting in touch with the universal is what's important.

358
00:36:30,879 --> 00:36:37,680
People are individuated only by what situation they happen to be in or what's wrong with them.

359
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:47,319
I mean, I used to think in days when everybody had a Volkswagen beetle and they all looked alike that you could tell your beetle by its particular dents.

360
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:49,319
And that's right, that's sort of how it is.

361
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:55,800
I mean, what makes people different from each other is how they fall short of this kind of moral perfection.

362
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:05,160
If there were people with moral perfection, they'd all be doing, insofar as they were in the same situation, they would do the same thing.

363
00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:11,159
And you'll see how important that is to Kierkegaard, that the ethical is the universal, as he puts it.

364
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,960
That's what I'm really trying to explain.

365
00:37:13,959 --> 00:37:16,760
And now, finally, metaphysics.

366
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:21,480
Metaphysics up there tells you what's real.

367
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,000
Well, again, it all goes back to theory.

368
00:37:24,999 --> 00:37:31,560
What's real is not what's temporal and historical and embodied and perceptual.

369
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:40,280
What's real is abstract and conceptual and non-local in time and space.

370
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:48,839
It's eternal and it applies to everybody everywhere all the time.

371
00:37:49,479 --> 00:37:53,400
And how do you get to that?

372
00:37:53,399 --> 00:38:00,920
Well, you have to get rid of your body, which is perspectival and local.

373
00:38:00,919 --> 00:38:05,560
And watch, let's see, what did I write here?

374
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:09,319
Well, in one place, Plato says the body is the tomb of the soul.

375
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:19,160
I mean, the soul, which is capable of grasping these theoretical, universal truths, is messed up by having them put in a body.

376
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:23,880
And so you want to get as far away from the body as much as possible.

377
00:38:23,879 --> 00:38:36,000
Because, and this is now the metaphysics, what you really want is what is abstract and true, necessarily true, always true.

378
00:38:35,999 --> 00:38:42,399
And that's what's real.

379
00:38:42,399 --> 00:38:43,679
That's what I'm trying to say.

380
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:49,439
What's real is the universal truths that you discover by theory.

381
00:38:49,439 --> 00:39:03,920
Try to think about science and think maybe what's really real are the quarks or the strings or whatever you find when you totally abstract from history, body, perspective, tradition, desires, emotions.

382
00:39:03,919 --> 00:39:08,319
What's left is what's really important and explains everything.

383
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:15,919
Even the universe for the Greeks has no beginning and no end.

384
00:39:15,919 --> 00:39:21,440
It cycles through patterns and with the right theory you can understand it.

385
00:39:21,439 --> 00:39:23,999
I mean, they wouldn't have liked the Big Bang.

386
00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:32,000
They would certainly have believed in the Big Crunch story that it just, there's no beginning and no end and it follows the same pattern again and again.

387
00:39:31,999 --> 00:39:36,319
And so does history on this view of this kind of metaphysics.

388
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:45,920
There must be some invariant pattern even in history if you can understand it and have a theory about it.

389
00:39:45,919 --> 00:39:58,000
And Thucydides, the first historian, had a theory about it, said that it had a pattern, said that the job of history was to find this pattern, which would repeat itself again and again.

390
00:39:57,999 --> 00:40:14,759
And he would describe the Peloponnesian Wars, and you would people who understood his description of the Peloponnesian Wars would be able to see what stage of going up or declining their culture was in, because every culture would go through repeatedly forever these patterns.

391
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:29,000
And so there's always something that is even in a given life, there's nothing radically new.

392
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:37,720
What happens is you've got a certain nature and a certain character, and it becomes more and more explicit in your life.

393
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:42,680
But it's important in this metaphysical view that there is nothing that's radically new.

394
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:46,600
Not in the universe, and not even in an individual life.

395
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:52,920
It's always the working out of a pattern, which, if you understood the theory, you could figure it out.

396
00:40:52,919 --> 00:41:03,719
Now, even if you're, maybe if you're in psychotherapy, Freud thought he had a theory that enabled him to figure out the pattern in all human lives.

397
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:09,560
That's another variation of this story.

398
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,399
So, let me sum that one up.

399
00:41:11,399 --> 00:41:13,480
So, what's the conclusion?

400
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,720
Well, or why do it?

401
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,839
Why live in theory?

402
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:18,199
That's what I want to ask next.

403
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:25,000
I mean, given the theory tells you how, you know, there's a story about knowledge and ethics and reality.

404
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:28,760
What do you want to get out of that?

405
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:41,800
Well, if you live in this way, that the theoretical part of you contemplates and merges with the theoretical structure of the universe, you get all sorts of goodies.

406
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,680
You're able to understand what's true.

407
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:57,440
You've got a kind of absolute knowledge of what principles that all men in all places and all times, all people have to believe because they're the way things are.

408
00:41:57,439 --> 00:42:03,280
And the power, incidentally, to predict what's going to happen next.

409
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:16,639
If you see the pattern the way Thucydides thinks you can see the pattern of history, or if you see the pattern in a person's life the way Freud thinks you can see the pattern in their life, then you get power and control because you can predict what's going on.

410
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,359
Things don't just happen at random.

411
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,440
So much for the knowledge.

412
00:42:21,439 --> 00:42:23,120
What do you get in ethics?

413
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:40,640
Well, you get you are able to satisfy the universal human need that you have to get in touch with what's eternal and absolute and intelligible.

414
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,159
That gives you, what do you get out of that?

415
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,639
Well, you get lucid about what you're doing.

416
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,280
You can give the reasons for what you do.

417
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:56,240
And the reasons for what you do will be intelligible to all other moral people anywhere, anytime.

418
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,960
We all remember, I'm going to come back to this next time.

419
00:42:58,959 --> 00:43:03,679
I mean, we all keep listening to this because it's not some alien culture.

420
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,640
It's us.

421
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:11,680
I mean, we, part of us, believe this, that if you could get, that there will be right principle.

422
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:25,440
There are still philosophers arguing for principles that, once you get them, will enable you to act in a way that it makes sense to you and to every other rational person who has access to the same principles.

423
00:43:25,439 --> 00:43:32,960
And one of the most amazing things is, Plato thinks, you could merge with this abstract reality.

424
00:43:32,959 --> 00:43:54,040
If you identify yourself as if it was your essence to be rational and detached and have a view from nowhere and understand theories, then that part of you, which is the essential part of you, will be free from time and change and conflict and death.

425
00:43:55,479 --> 00:44:12,120
So to be a theoretician, really to be one, is to get in touch with this world of eternal patterns, universal truths, and then it's only your body that will die and your perspective and your emotions and who cares.

426
00:44:13,479 --> 00:44:18,839
I would have thought at least that would be something a little hard to get anybody to believe these days.

427
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:24,680
If you could become eternal by getting in the right relation to theory.

428
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:31,240
But then about five years ago, a guy named Hans Moravec, a robot maker, published a book called Mind Children.

429
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,679
Anybody read that?

430
00:44:32,919 --> 00:44:35,239
I doubt it, luckily, happily.

431
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:40,520
But in any case, because it's a crazy book, but it is so platonic.

432
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:44,520
It says that what you really are is a program.

433
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:53,960
And if you could get your program and make it explicit, then you could put it on a computer and make backup copies.

434
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:57,400
So if bad things happen to your program, you'd always have it.

435
00:44:57,399 --> 00:44:59,960
And you'd be eternal.

436
00:44:59,959 --> 00:45:01,559
And isn't that wonderful?

437
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:18,039
And I was on some panel with Moravec, and I said, yeah, but there you get rid of love and food and sex and aesthetic experiences and all these kind of things that come from having this sort of this perishable body.

438
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:20,280
And he said, yeah, but that's all bad stuff anyway.

439
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,520
It interferes with your programming.

440
00:45:22,839 --> 00:45:25,039
And he is a Platonist.

441
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:26,319
He's a real living Platonist.

442
00:45:26,879 --> 00:45:36,560
He thinks he identifies himself with this program in his head that is able to help him when he's programming, and that's all that really matters.

443
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:47,040
Well, if you really believe in it, then you will want to get rid of everything, get rid of your body and merge with the rational structure of the universe.

444
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:52,800
There are people at MIT called extropians who also think that that's what we're finally becoming.

445
00:45:52,800 --> 00:46:00,880
We're finally becoming beings that are no longer perishable and get sick and die and so forth.

446
00:46:00,879 --> 00:46:01,760
And it's the same thing.

447
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,879
It's like Morovic.

448
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:08,960
It seems perfectly weird, but it's nice to know that there are still Plato people around.

449
00:46:08,959 --> 00:46:15,280
Okay, now we have 20 minutes, which is just what we need to look at the other half of the tradition.

450
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,559
Now, first, do you realize that there is another half?

451
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:29,600
I mean, what I've been saying should sound a little weird to you, but really not so weird here in the university where we're dedicated to theory and objectivity and disinterested inquiry and so forth.

452
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:35,120
But what's the other tradition that tells us what's important?

453
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:44,560
From the Greeks, we understand what it is to think, to be detached, self-critical, reflective, rational, objective.

454
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,000
That's all good stuff.

455
00:46:45,999 --> 00:46:48,800
But what else do we believe in?

456
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:52,559
Do you notice anything missing from what all I've been saying?

457
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,040
Something important about us?

458
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:56,800
Surely.

459
00:46:56,959 --> 00:46:59,279
I just think you we just don't know where to look for it.

460
00:46:59,439 --> 00:47:10,600
Well, the other important thing about us is that we are also in the Judeo-Christian religious tradition, which tells us what's important about us and what's important to do.

461
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,520
And that's very different.

462
00:47:14,359 --> 00:47:24,040
They have their own, that gives us a quite different understanding of human perfection and what we're here for and what's important, what's essential about us.

463
00:47:24,039 --> 00:47:37,319
And so, but to see that, you've got to look at the same categories, the theory of knowledge, of ethics, of metaphysics, that we looked at for the Greeks and see what the Hebrews say about them.

464
00:47:37,319 --> 00:48:00,200
You won't really understand how this call, how interesting this culture is, how deeply, I used to say schizophrenic, but people said that wasn't quite right, and that isn't quite right, how deeply polarized by two utterly different ways of looking at things, which is absolutely unique and marvelous, and probably gives this culture a lot of power.

465
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,359
But let's add a lot of grief.

466
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,200
But we have to first see what the other side looks like.

467
00:48:06,519 --> 00:48:15,719
By the way, the Hebrews, of course, didn't have categories like epistemology, morality, and metaphysics, because they weren't reflecting and doing philosophy.

468
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:21,079
They were out doing what they did, seemingly mostly pray and fight.

469
00:48:23,959 --> 00:48:26,280
But we can sort of impose those categories.

470
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,680
So what do they think about truth?

471
00:48:28,999 --> 00:48:35,000
Do they think that you get there by theory, that truth is what you see when you have a view from nowhere?

472
00:48:34,999 --> 00:48:36,120
Not at all.

473
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:40,280
Truth for the Hebrews is, it isn't even the same kind of truth.

474
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:47,560
It isn't that truth isn't statements or propositions that correspond to the way things are.

475
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,079
It's a different sense of truth.

476
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:52,600
It's being true to something or somebody.

477
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,559
In this case, the ultimate truth is to be true to God.

478
00:48:56,479 --> 00:49:03,920
That is, you devote your life to what God requires of you.

479
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:08,800
You don't get truth by detached contemplation.

480
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:13,600
You get it by total commitment and total involvement.

481
00:49:13,919 --> 00:49:26,400
In Hebrew talk, what's most important about truth is being true to God, which means keeping the covenant, keeping the deal that the Hebrews have made with God.

482
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,959
So notice what that does immediately.

483
00:49:30,959 --> 00:49:34,240
For the Greeks, remember, truth is open to all people everywhere.

484
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,520
It's universal.

485
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:38,160
All rational souls can get it.

486
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:48,960
For the Hebrews, truth is revealed at a certain time and place to Abraham, to Moses, and it's preserved in a tradition, namely their tradition.

487
00:49:48,959 --> 00:49:50,960
It's not for everybody.

488
00:49:50,959 --> 00:49:56,720
It's local and historical, not universal and timeless.

489
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:02,400
Now, and the way to see that, in a funny way, is how they deal with outsiders.

490
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:14,319
The Greeks thought that anybody, even the barbarians and the idol, are barbarians, could be brought into this rational, universal way of looking at things.

491
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:16,240
All they would have to do is learn Greek.

492
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:28,000
Barbarians, that means that was the noise, bar, bar, bar, was this funny noise that people made who didn't speak Greek, but they could be told how to speak Greek, and Greek is the language in which you can think.

493
00:50:27,999 --> 00:50:43,319
And Socrates actually demonstrates how a slave boy, Mino, can be brought to understand geometry, Pythagorean theorem, talking to him, presumably, in Greek.

494
00:50:43,319 --> 00:50:47,159
So anybody can be taught Greek.

495
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:54,519
Anybody can understand universal truths, can be a rational human being.

496
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:56,359
That's what human beings are.

497
00:50:56,359 --> 00:50:57,960
Now, what about Hebrews?

498
00:50:57,959 --> 00:51:00,839
How did they treat the foreigners?

499
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,519
Was their attitude is that everybody can be a Hebrew.

500
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:10,359
You just have to learn Hebrew, and we all got the same nature, and we've all got the same rationality.

501
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,160
No, it treated them as idol worshippers.

502
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:18,599
And idol worshipers were not to be, couldn't be converted into Hebrews.

503
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,600
They didn't have a covenant with God.

504
00:51:20,919 --> 00:51:29,079
What you do with idol worshippers is you either ignore them or you go running around killing them, which is in the beginning of the Old Testament.

505
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:32,760
That's what God commands people to do.

506
00:51:33,399 --> 00:51:47,160
There's one place in the early part of the Bible where some general doesn't want to kill the barbarian, or the idol worshippers, and lets them go, and God thinks that's the wrong thing to do and kills the general and all the idol worshippers.

507
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:52,120
It's not a universal religion.

508
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:58,359
It's a religion for those people and a truth for those people.

509
00:51:58,519 --> 00:52:01,079
And morality, what about that?

510
00:52:01,399 --> 00:52:03,880
Well, you can see that.

511
00:52:03,879 --> 00:52:07,880
But is the ultimate authority going to be God or reason?

512
00:52:07,879 --> 00:52:08,679
Is the question.

513
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:11,720
I mean, the ultimate authority for the Greeks was reason.

514
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:12,920
We saw that.

515
00:52:12,919 --> 00:52:14,280
That's what gives them the power.

516
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,319
That's what gets them to theory and gives them the power.

517
00:52:17,319 --> 00:52:19,159
But so what happens?

518
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,479
Anybody read the dialogue Euthyphro by?

519
00:52:22,999 --> 00:52:24,760
Because sometimes people read it in high school.

520
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:29,679
It's one of the early dialogues of Plato where he's telling us what Socrates thinks.

521
00:52:29,999 --> 00:52:40,960
Well, if you could see exactly the difference, if you understand what goes on in the Euthyphro, at one point, Socrates trying to find something that he can get common agreement with.

522
00:52:40,959 --> 00:52:47,600
Well, Euthyphro's out to kill his father, sorry, to turn in his father for having killed a slave.

523
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,880
And Socrates isn't sure whether that's the right thing to do.

524
00:52:50,879 --> 00:53:01,920
He wants to make sure that Euthyphro has thought about it clearly and has a total understanding of the theory involved and knows what the right thing to do for any rational person is.

525
00:53:01,919 --> 00:53:10,720
And so, but to start with, he asks, to get started, is an action pious is the word here, but let's just say good.

526
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:15,839
Is an action good because the gods love it, or do they love it because it's good?

527
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:18,319
What do you think Euthyphro answers?

528
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,720
The former.

529
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,720
Is it good because the gods love it?

530
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:29,679
That's the one you want?

531
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,879
Or do the gods love it because it's good?

532
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:34,640
The first one.

533
00:53:34,959 --> 00:53:36,559
No, I don't think so.

534
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,439
Euthyphro says that the gods love it because it's good.

535
00:53:41,439 --> 00:53:45,439
That means it's independently, rationally justified.

536
00:53:45,439 --> 00:53:46,399
Maybe that's what you were saying.

537
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:53,999
See, even gods, even the gods, are bound by reason and theory.

538
00:53:53,999 --> 00:53:57,760
I mean, there's some right action, and the gods are no dummies.

539
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,880
They're rational.

540
00:53:58,879 --> 00:54:03,520
So they approve and love and support people who do that.

541
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:11,800
The weird one, but it's ours, is ours insofar as we're also Judeo-Christian, is if you try that on the Hebrews.

542
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:19,079
If God love and approve of an action because it's, let's see, how does that wait?

543
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,680
I want to say it right.

544
00:54:21,319 --> 00:54:29,480
Okay, is an action good because God loves it, or does God love it because it's good, independent, defined?

545
00:54:29,479 --> 00:54:37,480
Well, we saw the Greeks say it's God loves it because it's good, independently defined, and God just has to do whatever rational beings have to do.

546
00:54:37,479 --> 00:54:43,160
So you can imagine the opposite is that it becomes good if God approves of it.

547
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:46,679
And of course, this is what we're getting close to Kierkegaard.

548
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:53,560
When God says to Abraham that he should kill his son, that isn't a universal, rational, good thing.

549
00:54:53,560 --> 00:55:00,280
It doesn't say all fathers should kill their son, but it becomes the right thing for Abraham to do.

550
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:08,200
So for the Hebrews, an action is good because God loves it or commands it.

551
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,880
I have to change it a little bit, but it's the same idea.

552
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:21,000
In other words, for Plato, God loves and commands what is rationally, independently good.

553
00:55:20,999 --> 00:55:26,839
For the Hebrews, whatever God loves and commands becomes good.

554
00:55:26,839 --> 00:55:29,400
And he doesn't do it by becoming universal.

555
00:55:29,399 --> 00:55:32,839
It just becomes that person's job to do that job.

556
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:34,200
It's his vocation.

557
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,399
It's his calling.

558
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,839
It'll be called later.

559
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:39,160
God goes around giving people callings.

560
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:42,120
And that's each one's individual.

561
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:53,839
Whereas for the Greeks, whatever the right answer is, it's binding on everybody, on gods and on men, all rational beings.

562
00:55:53,479 --> 00:55:58,079
So I'll say it one more time.

563
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:05,839
What's good is the same for everybody, for the Greeks, and it's universal.

564
00:56:06,479 --> 00:56:13,439
And for the Hebrews, what's good is determined by God's command, and it may be different for each man and woman.

565
00:56:13,439 --> 00:56:15,520
It's not universe.

566
00:56:16,399 --> 00:56:18,479
So, and that's going to be a big deal.

567
00:56:18,479 --> 00:56:20,720
Keep your eyes open as you read the Kierkegaard.

568
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:28,880
Kierkegaard keeps talking about Abraham being up against the universal and being called to go against the universe.

569
00:56:28,879 --> 00:56:30,640
And you can see why.

570
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:35,200
Okay, and now in metaphysics, it's really terrific, the difference.

571
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,479
So for the Greeks, time doesn't matter.

572
00:56:38,479 --> 00:56:54,479
What's significant is the eternal, repeated, rational patterns of history, of the stars, of everything, the universe, and so forth, and people's lives, and so forth.

573
00:56:54,479 --> 00:56:56,319
But what about the Hebrews?

574
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,319
Is time important?

575
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,240
And how?

576
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,680
I mean, time is absolutely crucially important.

577
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,680
And this, I think, by the way, back to the Buddhists.

578
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:10,960
I mean, this is one of the ways I think that you can see that the Buddhists are more on the Plato side.

579
00:57:10,959 --> 00:57:16,080
For them, time isn't important, and there are recurring things that are what's important.

580
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,319
Well, not for the Hebrews.

581
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:21,199
The world is created at a certain moment in time.

582
00:57:21,519 --> 00:57:22,479
That's pretty important.

583
00:57:22,479 --> 00:57:24,400
The creation takes place.

584
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:28,880
And then Abraham gets rid of the idols at a certain time.

585
00:57:28,879 --> 00:57:32,720
And Moses comes around at a certain time and gets the Ten Commandments.

586
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:36,479
And then God gets into time in history as the God-man.

587
00:57:36,479 --> 00:57:40,240
Kierkegaard has lots to say about that.

588
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:48,680
So time is what everything important happens in time in the Hebrew story.

589
00:57:52,200 --> 00:58:01,480
And there are these crucial historical moments which are absolutely defining of what's important.

590
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:31,720
And as far as individuals are concerned, this is very important to Kierkegaard particularly, instead of thinking that what people do is kind of live out a certain pattern of what all human beings do, or live out at least what is implicit in their particular life, their character, what the Greeks don't have any place for is some radical new creation, something that wasn't already there as an implicit pattern.

591
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:32,760
And what is that?

592
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,920
Well, it's being reborn.

593
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:41,079
The Judeo-Christian tradition, at least the Christian part of it, has an important notion of being reborn.

594
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:45,640
With Kierkegaard language, you'll see him talk at one place about becoming a new being.

595
00:58:45,959 --> 00:58:48,920
And you also get a new world.

596
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:54,040
That is, that's why we count BC and AD.

597
00:58:54,039 --> 00:59:01,399
I mean, when God comes into time on the Judeo-Christian tradition, the world has just radically changed.

598
00:59:01,399 --> 00:59:05,559
It doesn't go through cycles, just any old cycles.

599
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:12,599
This is a one-time thing, and it changes the world.

600
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:15,079
And it's a new, it becomes the Christian world.

601
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:24,600
It takes a little while to work itself out, but we count our time from there, just like the Hebrews count their time.

602
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:30,319
I think it's 5,782 years I've written down from the original creation.

603
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:38,720
But then there can be new creations for the universe, at least one, this one, for the Christian one.

604
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:48,959
And for each individual, there is a possibility of becoming a new individual, getting a new definition of who you are, becoming totally different.

605
00:59:51,680 --> 01:00:00,559
So for the Greeks, any kind of transformation is only a change from something which is implicit to something which is explicit.

606
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,879
That's the only kind of change you can have.

607
01:00:02,879 --> 01:00:07,279
The pattern is already there, but it can become more obvious.

608
01:00:07,919 --> 01:00:17,599
For the Hebrews, you can think of something created, a radical transformation, which is an outrage for the Greek thinking.

609
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,279
And Kierkegaard again has a lot to say about this, but not in what we read.

610
01:00:23,279 --> 01:00:30,559
For Christians who are all start out as sinners, there isn't any potential in them which can be realized.

611
01:00:30,959 --> 01:00:37,039
Aristotle and the Greeks thought about self-realization, bringing out the positive potential in people.

612
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:44,159
But the way Kierkegaard, anyway, reads the notion of original sin, there isn't any positive potential in people.

613
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:46,399
What they have to do is be reborn.

614
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,439
And then there's something positive about them.

615
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,559
But it's not something that's there all along.

616
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,559
So that's another reference.

617
01:00:55,520 --> 01:01:00,959
So now, having said all that, it's time to see if anybody wants to say anything.

618
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:07,999
I can go on talking, and I will, but not unless, but only if nobody wants to say anything.

619
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:09,760
Did I start this?

620
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,239
No, that's all right.

621
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:13,560
I'm not recording this online.

622
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:16,039
It's a podcaster who's better be recording it.

623
01:01:16,279 --> 01:01:32,519
Okay, let's see what's yet.

624
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,800
Yes, logic.

625
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:34,119
Good.

626
01:01:34,119 --> 01:01:36,680
Logic is another important part of it.

627
01:01:39,239 --> 01:01:40,600
God being eternal.

628
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:48,520
Well, let's put it this way: it becomes in philosophy as if God was the eternal truth of logic.

629
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:53,559
I mean, that's the basic structure of the universe.

630
01:01:53,560 --> 01:02:05,559
Hegel's basic philosophy book is called The Logic, and out of it he derives from his kind of logic all the basic structures of everything, and those are eternal structures.

631
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:06,999
Yeah, you're on the right track.

632
01:02:06,999 --> 01:02:19,879
I mean, that's really where it didn't get that far, I think, with Plato, but it got that far finally with Hegel, then drove Kierkegaard off a wall, and then it made him so unhappy.

633
01:02:19,879 --> 01:02:34,119
And Pascal makes a nasty remark about Descartes, where he says, People who don't want to think about the death and the sort of difficulty of human existence can sit in their room all day doing geometry.

634
01:02:35,879 --> 01:02:38,119
That was what Descartes thought was important.

635
01:02:38,119 --> 01:02:40,999
So, Pascal thinks he puts it on the same level as play tennis.

636
01:02:40,999 --> 01:02:43,720
They can either go play tennis or sit in their room and do geometry.

637
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:48,039
For Pascal, that's just all irrelevant to what's important.

638
01:02:51,239 --> 01:02:51,720
Yeah.

639
01:03:05,279 --> 01:03:07,279
Universal wire in your own word.

640
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:16,800
What did you say about universal?

641
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:19,999
Is this really going to be about inspirational?

642
01:03:21,919 --> 01:03:25,359
Ah, you're always asking these questions before anybody else has done the reading.

643
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,279
So you should come to office hours.

644
01:03:27,279 --> 01:03:27,760
Office hours.

645
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,359
I got to write that on the board in a second.

646
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:34,959
But anyway, yeah, Nietzsche's notion of eternal recurrence is like the Greek.

647
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:35,519
Yeah.

648
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:43,680
The same patterns repeat themselves over and over and over and always and infinitely and so forth.

649
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,079
Yeah, but let me put my office hours on the board.

650
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:06,879
Office hours are Wednesday, 4 to 6, and 303 Moses.

651
01:04:06,879 --> 01:04:08,720
Anybody else got anything to say?

652
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:09,119
Yeah.

653
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,600
Can I see a hang-up?

654
01:04:12,879 --> 01:04:13,359
Yeah.

655
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:18,879
Stand up then, and I'm either going to want to give you the microphones.

656
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:32,559
Just a final announcement from your GSIs that you have to get into a section in order to take the class, and you have to be here next Thursday for Lexburg in order to get into a section.

657
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,800
So make sure you come Thursday, especially.

658
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,199
Don't just listen to the podcast for that lecture.

659
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:44,119
And if you can't come, then you have to send me an email by the way.

660
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:15,319
I hope somebody comes and tells us how we're supposed to get in touch with the podcast.

661
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,959
Anyway, the best thing is to stay to come.

662
01:05:17,959 --> 01:05:19,479
You've got to come on Thursday.

663
01:05:20,119 --> 01:05:23,559
By the end of Thursday, we ought to know what's going to happen next.

664
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:24,199
Okay.
