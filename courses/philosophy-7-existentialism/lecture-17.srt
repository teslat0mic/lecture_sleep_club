00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,120
Second issue is the issue of community, about whether each person can believe in God on his or her own without any community support and without any objective evidence or not.

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:26,160
The Protestant view of community is that an individual's faith isn't based on any objective evidence and doesn't have any correlation with anybody else's beliefs or faith.

3
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,641
Each has their own faith.

4
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:31,840
Luther said, each man is a pope.

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,601
Kierkegaard said, each person is alone before God.

6
00:00:36,081 --> 00:00:41,241
And Kierkegaard said, Christianity has no objective validity.

7
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:46,440
And Dostoevsky is on this very Kierkegaardian wavelength.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,480
He knows what this view looks like.

9
00:00:49,481 --> 00:00:53,480
Remember, Kierkegaard says Abraham is in total isolation.

10
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,480
He is on a lonely path.

11
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:02,120
He can't explain to himself or anyone else, or he can't explain to anyone, even himself, what he's doing.

12
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:10,920
And that certainly is a Kierkegaardian Protestant Lutheran view.

13
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:31,240
And it finally leads to Kierkegaard attacking Lutheran Church for providing a herd or a community to protect people from the hard task of having faith all by themselves in isolation, even in opposition to the intelligibility and to the ethical.

14
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:54,920
But what I want to quote this time, because it sounds so much like the Christ of the Grand Inquisitor story, something from Kierkegaard's attack on Christendom, which was his last book, his actual critic attack on the Lutheran Church as standing sort of between people, preventing people from being Christians.

15
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,441
He says, the spiritual man differs from us men in being able to endure isolation.

16
00:02:00,441 --> 00:02:09,001
His rank as a spiritual man is proportionate to his strength for enduring isolation, whereas we men are constantly in need of the others, the herd.

17
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:14,361
That's the Grand Inquisitor calls us the ante, the others, the herd.

18
00:02:14,361 --> 00:02:21,321
We die or despair if we're not reassured by being in the herd, of the same opinion as the herd, etc.

19
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:29,121
But the Christianity of the New Testament is precisely reckoned upon and related to the isolation of the spiritual man.

20
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:41,521
Christianity in the New Testament consists in loving God in hatred to man, in hatred to oneself, and thereby of other men, hating father, mother, one's own child, wife, etc.

21
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,961
The strongest expression for the most agonizing isolation.

22
00:02:44,961 --> 00:02:46,561
It's really incredible.

23
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:57,840
I mean, he gets this from these passages where Jesus' family comes around and he interrupts him when he's going about his preaching and he says, and they say, your mother and brother and sisters are here.

24
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,481
And he says, I don't have any mother, brothers, or sisters.

25
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,081
So Kierkegaard is making that very central.

26
00:03:04,081 --> 00:03:04,880
So I'll go on.

27
00:03:04,881 --> 00:03:08,000
The strongest expression of the most agonizing isolation.

28
00:03:08,001 --> 00:03:14,321
And it is in view of this, I say, that such men, men of this quality and caliber, are not born anymore.

29
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:22,800
Just like the Grand Inquisitor saying, you know, I can go alone and live in isolation for years on berries in the wilderness, that very few people can do that.

30
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:31,840
And you get the impression that nobody can do it now, except maybe Father Farrapont, who thinks he's the only one who can give up his bread and who's completely crazy.

31
00:03:32,961 --> 00:03:37,360
If there aren't any sane ascetics, they don't seem to be around anymore.

32
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,840
So the Jesus figure then says that you have to be able to live in this kind of isolation.

33
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,480
And the Grand Inquisitor says it's impossible.

34
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,641
Human beings can't do that.

35
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:54,000
We'll provide community comfort by way of the church.

36
00:03:54,001 --> 00:04:14,680
So otherwise, people will become dangerous because, and we're seeing it happening right now, they get into sectarian fights in which they're killing each other because each one of them thinks that they've got the one truth that is supposed to, that really applies to everybody.

37
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:23,081
Dostoevsky is saying this on 247 near the top, about eight lines down.

38
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:31,720
For these pitiful creatures are concerned not only to find something that all would believe in and worship, what is essential is that all may be together in it.

39
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:39,480
The craving for community of worship is the chief misery of every man individually and of all humanity from the beginning of time.

40
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,401
For the sake of common worship, they've slain each other with the sword.

41
00:04:43,401 --> 00:04:45,961
That seems true.

42
00:04:45,961 --> 00:04:49,561
The Grand Inquisitor seems something there.

43
00:04:49,881 --> 00:05:01,160
And the Grand Inquisitor says the only answer to this absolute need, this craving of all human beings, is to set up one universal church, Christendom.

44
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:15,641
You just go out with your crusades and your missionaries, and you finally make the whole world Christian, and then everybody stops killing everybody else, and everybody's happy because they've all found one shared truth they can all believe in.

45
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:19,881
That's what the Grand Inquisitor has done, or is on the way to doing.

46
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:28,601
On 252, he says, but that's not right.

47
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,200
Ah, that's too bad.

48
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,161
I don't understand that.

49
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,921
I've mistyped something.

50
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,761
Where would this be?

51
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,481
He talks about if we'll get them all together in a universal ante.

52
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:42,361
Let's find it.

53
00:05:43,641 --> 00:05:47,081
Well, anybody keep looking until you find it.

54
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,881
Well, maybe we won't find it.

55
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:00,241
It's in here, anyway.

56
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:07,041
Says that that is what the Grand Inquisitor is promising.

57
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,721
And that's, we don't have to read it.

58
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,641
That's pretty straightforward.

59
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:18,001
When it's just, I feel uneasy when I can't find what I want, but I also feel that I shouldn't be wasting my time trying to find it.

60
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,401
One more look.

61
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:21,201
Why is not.

62
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:50,241
Well, believe it or not, I seem to have marked it, but not marked.

63
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,521
I'm going to look with it.

64
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:57,681
Well, anything else?

65
00:06:57,761 --> 00:07:00,401
I just want to mark that I have it wrong.

66
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,361
Okay, next issue.

67
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:06,560
I can't settle that.

68
00:07:06,881 --> 00:07:09,841
Next issue is the morality issue.

69
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:15,280
That has lots of different sub-issues, you can see from the chart that we've been looking at.

70
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,121
And they are confession, miracles, mystery, and authority.

71
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,160
There's a lot to be said about each of them, at least a lot to be said about two of them.

72
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,681
So let's start.

73
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,881
Confession.

74
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:33,040
That's going to turn out to be a wonderful one for demagicalizing.

75
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,761
We have to first just state the issue.

76
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,360
So here's confession.

77
00:07:37,361 --> 00:07:44,601
Jesus, according to the Grand Inquisitor, demands that people must get along without moral support or moral guidance.

78
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:47,321
Kierkegaard has a similar view.

79
00:07:47,721 --> 00:08:02,601
And therefore, by the way, that means he's against confession, where you go to the priest and he tells you whether what you've done is wrong and how wrong and gives you a penance to make up for what you've done.

80
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:09,961
All of that seems to the Grand Inquisitor to be something that Jesus is opposing.

81
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:18,361
And Kierkegaard, speaking like Jesus, says that confession is a kind of immoral temptation.

82
00:08:18,361 --> 00:08:19,320
That's not his quote.

83
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,761
I'll read you his quote.

84
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:29,161
He says, every human being is gloriously constituted, again from the attack on Christendom, every human being is gloriously constituted.

85
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:38,761
But what ruins so many is, among other things, all this wretched tittle-tattle between man and man about that which should be suffered and matured in silence.

86
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,001
If you've done something wrong, then you should realize it's wrong.

87
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:51,241
And when you realize it's wrong, you have to have this inner suffering where you punish yourself.

88
00:08:51,560 --> 00:09:05,881
This confession before, then Kierkegaard's against this confession before men instead of before God, this hardy communication between this man and that about what ought to be secret and exist only before God in secrecy.

89
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:10,121
This impatient craving for intermediary consolation.

90
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:16,280
So that now, but and Jesus says, we're not going to satisfy that.

91
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:21,001
We're going to demand that people not get that kind of confidence.

92
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:34,960
So let's hope it's on 248 at the top, about four lines down.

93
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:44,481
In place of the rigid ancient law, man must hereafter, with free heart, decide for himself what is good and evil, having only thy image before him as his guide.

94
00:09:44,481 --> 00:09:53,040
But that's what the Grand Inquisitor says, Jesus says, and that's what the Grand Inquisitor says people can't put up with.

95
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,841
They have to be told, they have to be given guidance to what's good and evil.

96
00:09:57,841 --> 00:10:00,641
They have to confess when they've done something evil.

97
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,800
And he's got it close.

98
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:14,801
I mean, Roman Catholicism certainly puts confession, individual confession between an individual and the priest, and as an important, I think, called sacrament.

99
00:10:16,481 --> 00:10:26,081
And so you get the Grand Inquisitor saying on 252 how he's going to deal with it in the middle.

100
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,321
And they will have no secrets from us.

101
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:39,521
We shall allow or forbid them to live with their wives and mistresses, to have or have not have children, according to whether they have been obedient or disobedient, and they will submit to us gladly and cheerfully.

102
00:10:39,521 --> 00:10:48,241
The most painful, this is the confession part, the most painful secrets of their conscience, all, all they will bring to us, and we shall have an answer for all.

103
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:58,161
They will be glad to believe our answer, for it will save them from the great fear and terrible agony that they endure at present in making a free decision for themselves.

104
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,081
So that's the Grand Inquisitor's side.

105
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:09,961
The Protestant side is Jesus precisely did what the Grand Inquisitor said he did.

106
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:23,321
That is, he said he was replacing the Hebrew law or fulfilling it anyway, claiming that you had to decide for yourself what was okay to do on the Sabbath and what was not, for instance.

107
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:33,161
And there was no general, once you get rid of the law, then you have to, as Augustine said, love and do what you will.

108
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,121
That is, your only guideline is going to be your own feelings.

109
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:45,961
That's the Protestant view, all right, and that's the view the Grand Inquisitor attributes to Jesus.

110
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:53,801
There's no public justification for moral beliefs, and you could recognize that as the suspension of the ethical.

111
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,201
Every individual is higher than the universal.

112
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,280
Every individual has their own right.

113
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:09,481
Abraham has some kind of duty and rightness being what, from the public point of view, is a murderer.

114
00:12:09,481 --> 00:12:24,601
And that's the, and there's, and you'll only make, you can make life a lot easier for people if you take that away, but that's the highest Christian demand, the Dostoevsky Jesus says.

115
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:26,681
Now, remember, don't get lost.

116
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,121
In each of these cases, we are always having an antinomy.

117
00:12:30,121 --> 00:12:34,040
There is the extreme Roman Catholic version.

118
00:12:34,040 --> 00:13:06,241
Every person gets moral guidelines, gets confessing, gets forgiven, and so forth by the church, which has a universal ethics and knows what's right and wrong, on the one hand, which seems unacceptable, and on the other hand, Kierkegaard-like, total freedom, suspending the ethical, everybody doing what they are called to do, and which is unintelligible and goes against the moral standards and can't be confessed to anybody because they wouldn't understand it, and so forth.

119
00:13:06,241 --> 00:13:12,881
Okay, and the question, of course, again, don't get lost, is there must be some third way if it's an antinomy.

120
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:24,241
And if this, and if there's one piece missing, remember, we're going back and forth between what the Protestant Lutheran view and the Roman Catholic view, just so I want to make sure you're all with it.

121
00:13:24,241 --> 00:13:27,681
What's the third view that we're not at yet?

122
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,881
Yes, the Russian Orthodox.

123
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:31,681
Who said?

124
00:13:32,001 --> 00:13:34,961
Somebody back there, winning some points.

125
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,601
Anyway, right, I see who said it.

126
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:44,320
Okay, so we're always, we're going to always find that there is a third possibility, the Russian Orthodox.

127
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,560
But it's hard to see, that's what I want to tell you.

128
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,201
And Dostoevsky has set it up brilliantly.

129
00:13:49,200 --> 00:14:09,200
What could be a third position, which is neither the confession and morality for everybody kind of view, and the everybody does what they please, and if they do something wrong, they have to decide it's wrong and in isolation with God to suffer for it.

130
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,720
Is there a third view?

131
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,361
Yes, there is, and maybe some of you, I hope, have gotten far enough to read it already.

132
00:14:15,361 --> 00:14:16,321
But let's go on.

133
00:14:16,321 --> 00:14:18,081
We're still setting up the problems.

134
00:14:18,081 --> 00:14:21,520
Miracles, which I hope to get to today.

135
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,280
No, no, I won't get to miracles today.

136
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,480
I certainly will on Thursday.

137
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,440
That's why I want you to read up to 350, so we will have all the pieces.

138
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:42,680
The question of miracles is whether people could keep their faith freely without miracles, or must people have miracles, suspension of physical laws, to believe in God.

139
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:59,081
So the question, the temptation to Jesus was that he would perform a miracle, throw himself down from the tem top of the temple and show people how he wouldn't get hurt, how the angels would catch him and cushion his fall, and that would in effect force them all to believe in him.

140
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:03,160
Who could resist when you get a demonstration like that?

141
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:10,041
And that's what people absolutely need.

142
00:15:10,361 --> 00:15:33,480
On 248, about three-quarters of the way down, the Grand Inquisitor says, is the nature of men such that they can reject miracles at the same moments of their, at the great moments of their life, the moments of their deepest and most agonizing spiritual difficulties, cling only to the free verdict of the heart.

143
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,280
So that's a question.

144
00:15:36,281 --> 00:15:57,641
Can people, the best people, but normal people, not people like the Grand Inquisitor, can ordinary people live without miracles to give without having a religion that they are forced to believe in because it performs miracles?

145
00:15:57,641 --> 00:15:58,920
That's the question.

146
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:04,440
The interesting thing is to see whether Dostoevsky thinks people can live without miracles.

147
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:10,521
If he thinks they can, can't, then how is he going to put in, how's he going to show a miracle?

148
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,520
But we're not quite ready for that.

149
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:18,361
So, what he says is, Jesus didn't perform miracles to get people to believe in God.

150
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:20,361
That's what the Grand Inquisitor says.

151
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:23,160
Remember the question somebody asked last time?

152
00:16:23,361 --> 00:16:25,440
We have to go back to at this point.

153
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:36,320
How come Jesus was performing miracles, raising a child from the dead on the steps of the church when the Grand Inquisitor found him and arrested him?

154
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,800
It looks like that's inconsistent.

155
00:16:39,121 --> 00:16:41,361
He's supposed to not perform miracles.

156
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,441
I think the answer is supposed to be.

157
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:59,760
I mean, you could just think Yvonne made a mistake, but it's not likely Yvonne made a mistake because, after all, Dostoevsky wrote it, and he thinks Yvonne is very, he's created a character who's very smart, a philosophy major, he wouldn't make a mistake.

158
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,160
So, what's going on?

159
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:09,760
Well, I think the point is these people are not being convinced to be Christians and have faith by this miracle.

160
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:15,200
It's not sort of something that forces them to believe in Jesus as God.

161
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:25,601
Because they have faith already, they're asking him to do this, and because he loves them, and because they do have faith, he's performing the miracle.

162
00:17:26,081 --> 00:17:35,920
So, it's all right to perform miracles if you're not doing it in order to force people to believe in what you're doing.

163
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:51,200
It's not very important, but I think that's the answer: that this is not the kind of miracle you get when you throw yourself off the top of the temple and just create a big demonstration of your absolutely power to go against the laws of physics and chemistry.

164
00:17:51,200 --> 00:18:02,480
This is the kind of miracle Jesus was going around doing to poor people who had faith, and just because he was feeling sorry for them, he wanted to help them out.

165
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,680
I think that's the right answer.

166
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,641
Don't feel that it's important.

167
00:18:07,641 --> 00:18:11,720
If there was no miracle at the beginning, that would be all of the story, that would be fine, too.

168
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:23,801
The main thing is the other thing that the Grand Inquisitor says, the church will make up miracles because people do need miracles to force them to believe in it.

169
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,561
And he says this on 250 at the top, five lines down.

170
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:35,401
We have corrected thy work, thy work, corrected thy work, and have funded it.

171
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,680
Funded it?

172
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,281
Should be founded it, shouldn't it?

173
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:42,601
Founded it upon miracle, mystery, and authority.

174
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,680
This little typo reminds me of something.

175
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,760
Keep your eye open for something I was looking for and can't find.

176
00:18:50,760 --> 00:19:08,601
There's some place in at least a different translation where it talks about where the translator has them talking about Father Zosima's ashes, where obviously it should be his remains because he isn't cremated and there aren't any ashes.

177
00:19:08,601 --> 00:19:21,081
And so if you find out, if you see any, if you see where, if this translation does it, where it either says Father Zosima's remains or it says Father Zosima's ashes, I want to know so I can look at the Russian.

178
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:30,601
I have a feeling that anybody who just pays attention to the story can get the translation righter than saying ashes, but I can't find where it happened.

179
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:34,760
So anyway, that's back to the big deal issues now.

180
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:41,240
There are two more issues that I don't have anything to say about it.

181
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:43,401
And that's mystery and authority.

182
00:19:43,401 --> 00:19:47,080
I don't know what the antinome is.

183
00:19:47,401 --> 00:19:56,240
Something like you make mysteries that are really just puzzling kind of problem.

184
00:19:56,561 --> 00:20:05,680
Or you have mysteries which are, I don't know what, some feeling of the wonder, wonderfulness of everything.

185
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,401
I don't know what.

186
00:20:06,401 --> 00:20:08,240
I don't know what the opposition is.

187
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,401
So I don't know what the solution is.

188
00:20:10,401 --> 00:20:21,601
And if anybody does and can write a paper about it, then you get an A plus for sure, because it would be a real contribution, because the next time I gave the course, I could explain mystery and authority.

189
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,361
A little easier to do authority.

190
00:20:23,361 --> 00:20:25,440
I have a feeling maybe you could do it.

191
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:32,800
I mean, authority has to do with the Grand Inquisitor being a super authority, the Pope.

192
00:20:32,801 --> 00:20:38,480
And on the other hand, there could be nobody who's an authority.

193
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,440
There could be some middle kind of authority.

194
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,320
Maybe elders like Dosova, I don't know.

195
00:20:44,321 --> 00:21:09,281
But anyway, what the paper topic is, is try to figure out what the Roman Catholic view of mystery and authority is supposed to be, according to Dostoevsky, what the Protestant view of mystery and or authority is supposed to be, according to Dostoevsky, and then find out what Dostoevsky thinks the Russian Orthodox view is.

196
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:10,641
It must be in here.

197
00:21:11,361 --> 00:21:14,480
The structure of the book sort of requires it.

198
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:22,720
And you'll see why I say that when I show you specifically, just as he's got an answer to the food problem, he's got an answer to miracles.

199
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,560
He's got an answer to confession.

200
00:21:24,561 --> 00:21:30,080
So he ought to have an answer to these other two categories.

201
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:32,321
Anyway, do help me.

202
00:21:32,321 --> 00:21:37,601
And you, you, I really, really will feel bad that I can't see this one.

203
00:21:37,601 --> 00:21:41,320
Okay, now let's go just quickly.

204
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
We finish now, the antinomies.

205
00:21:43,881 --> 00:21:52,361
We've got the ones, we've got the material goods antinomies, the economics, the bread, temptation.

206
00:21:52,361 --> 00:22:01,081
We've got the ethical, the confession antinomies, and we've got the miracle.

207
00:22:01,641 --> 00:22:02,760
See, I'm missing one.

208
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:05,241
I guess not.

209
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:05,881
No, that's right.

210
00:22:05,881 --> 00:22:12,840
The confession one, which is the ethics one, and the miracle one, which is what keeps people having faith.

211
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,401
Wait a minute.

212
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:17,320
There's another one.

213
00:22:17,321 --> 00:22:18,760
How have I done this?

214
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,720
There's another one in here somewhere.

215
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,720
I didn't bring my chart.

216
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,840
But there's another one in there.

217
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,440
There's a community one.

218
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,720
That is where, whether it's got to do with everybody being, oh, yeah, the community issue.

219
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,121
That's all.

220
00:22:32,121 --> 00:22:33,081
I talked about it first.

221
00:22:33,081 --> 00:22:34,920
I just, that was with my mind.

222
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,641
Okay, yeah.

223
00:22:35,641 --> 00:22:39,641
So there's the community issue, whether everybody has to believe the same thing or not.

224
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:47,080
There's the ethics issue, which is the issue of confession and telling people what's right and wrong.

225
00:22:47,081 --> 00:23:05,800
And then there's this last kind of issue that I don't quite know what to call it, but let's call, it's got to do with miracle, mystery, authority, and wait a minute.

226
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,081
I'm still mixing them up.

227
00:23:07,401 --> 00:23:08,201
What is my chart?

228
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,641
Anybody got a chart?

229
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,601
Give me a chart.

230
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:13,960
Thanks.

231
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,641
Okay, let's look at it.

232
00:23:16,281 --> 00:23:19,241
I keep, because I'm sort of sticking different things I see.

233
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,920
Okay, let's stick to the chart.

234
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,641
After all, it's probably, I must have known what I was doing when I made it.

235
00:23:24,641 --> 00:23:31,680
So, okay, we've got the bread issue done, asceticism, material comfort, boring moderation.

236
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:45,440
We've got the community church issue done, and that's whether everybody has to believe the same thing, whether there is a universal Christendom or whether everybody is on their own, totally.

237
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,040
And then there's the morality one, and under that comes the confession.

238
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:54,160
I don't know, morality is a funny title, because I don't know why miracles belong in there.

239
00:23:54,160 --> 00:24:01,440
There's some third category, I don't know what the name of it is, which has in it confessions, miracles, mystery, authority.

240
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:09,361
And now we're ready to go and find and do the way, the answer in the book.

241
00:24:09,361 --> 00:24:12,160
But first, I want to say something about the other issue.

242
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,520
Remember that you gave me two problems from last time.

243
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,881
One was how come there was a miracle at the beginning of the book, of the Yvonne story.

244
00:24:20,881 --> 00:24:25,520
Remember what the other problem was that I couldn't figure out last time?

245
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,401
Yes, good, good.

246
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:29,680
You have us a little worried.

247
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:36,320
Somebody saves me from panic that you don't remember from one lecture to the next anything that we said.

248
00:24:36,321 --> 00:24:50,000
Okay, so I got the problem about Yvonne's, the fact that, in Yvonne's story, the Grand Inquisitor, that Jesus kisses the Grand Inquisitor.

249
00:24:50,641 --> 00:24:54,240
Now, it's clear, some things are clear.

250
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,401
Yvonne certainly wrote this story.

251
00:24:56,401 --> 00:24:58,080
It's not just anybody's story.

252
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:03,361
There are you either are perfect and godlike or you're disgusting, weak, and worthless.

253
00:25:03,361 --> 00:25:06,240
The two sides of the self are in there.

254
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:17,960
Now, why does Yvonne, in effect, and Yvonne, now I want to make a new point, in some ways is like the Grand Inquisitor.

255
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:30,441
Because he, like the Grand Inquisitor, thinks that almost everybody is weak and worthless, but only a few people like Yvonne can be really impeccable.

256
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:42,361
And so he disdains everybody else, but he also feels the idea that he sort of feels sorry for them the way he collects the children dust.

257
00:25:42,361 --> 00:25:47,480
Yeah, of course, it isn't real sorrow, it's sadism, but I don't think he knows that.

258
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,840
So what happens with the kiss?

259
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,520
Well, I think Jesus kisses the Grand Inquisitor.

260
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,920
Let's stay inside the story for a minute.

261
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:05,641
Because of his purity, because of his good intentions, because of his lofty way of being.

262
00:26:06,601 --> 00:26:09,080
Now, who does that remind you of?

263
00:26:09,081 --> 00:26:10,040
I've already said it.

264
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:11,720
Sort of back into it.

265
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:16,121
The Grand Inquisitor is in that way like Yvonne.

266
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:26,760
And so, in that way, and like Yvonne, he's supposed to be a defender of these weak, worthless people.

267
00:26:27,401 --> 00:26:29,720
He doesn't accept the world as it is.

268
00:26:30,761 --> 00:26:32,760
He and the church are going to fix it.

269
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,801
That's a difference.

270
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:40,520
Yvonne wants to kill himself in protest, while the Grand Inquisitor is going to fix up the mess left by Jesus.

271
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:48,601
But at least this: the Grand Inquisitor is pure and noble and so forth.

272
00:26:48,601 --> 00:27:04,801
What I'm trying to say is, I think when Jesus kisses the Grand Inquisitor in Ivan's story, it's Yvonne kissing himself in the sense that he identifies with and sort of admires the Grand Inquisitor.

273
00:27:04,801 --> 00:27:07,760
He wouldn't make the demands that Jesus makes on everybody.

274
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,560
He thinks everybody else is weak and worthless.

275
00:27:10,561 --> 00:27:18,960
And he wouldn't be, and he's closer anyway to trying to help all these weak and worthless people out.

276
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:26,480
So then the next question is, and then Alyasha plagiarizes the kiss by kissing Yvonne.

277
00:27:26,801 --> 00:27:46,401
Well, I think just as Jesus sees the Grand Inquisitor's good intentions, and so Alyasha sees Yvonne's good intentions, and he hopes that somehow Yvonne will work out the aspect of Yvonne that's wrong.

278
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:52,641
This aspect of Yvonne that wants to be lofty and good and pure will get together with the earthy.

279
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,561
The heavenly and the earthly will get together somehow.

280
00:27:56,561 --> 00:27:59,521
And he's kissing him because he's trying.

281
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,881
He's got the wrong method right now, getting rid of the path, but he's trying.

282
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:26,401
It's very different than the way Zosima bows to the ground before Dimitri, because Dimitri understands that people are both lofty and base, both good and bad, and he's trying to get it together and suffering from trying to get it together.

283
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:44,121
That's more of a tribute to Yvonne than Yvonne, than Alyasha's that's sorry, that's more of a tribute to Dimitri, I'm trying to say, from Zosima, than Alyasha's kiss could possibly mean when he kisses Yvonne goodbye.

284
00:28:44,281 --> 00:28:49,480
But he's hoping that Yvonne will come through.

285
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:52,200
Let's see what else is.

286
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:03,881
Yeah, that's all I have to say about that.

287
00:29:04,361 --> 00:29:07,801
It's not a very interesting or important question, probably.

288
00:29:07,801 --> 00:29:11,080
Or at least I don't consider that a very interesting and important answer.

289
00:29:11,081 --> 00:29:11,720
Yeah.

290
00:29:29,081 --> 00:29:30,760
Ah, okay, let's see.

291
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,561
You hear her?

292
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,520
Probably not.

293
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:46,680
So is there some connection between the fact that the Grand Inquisitor says to Jesus, go out and never come back, and Yvonne says to Alyasha, I'm going to tell you the story of my life, then I never want to see you again.

294
00:29:49,561 --> 00:29:51,000
I don't know.

295
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,200
It's an interesting question.

296
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,281
Let me conclude longer.

297
00:29:58,121 --> 00:29:59,320
I doubt it.

298
00:29:59,321 --> 00:30:07,480
Because what it means when the Grand Inquisitor says to Jesus, go out and never come back, it's you're just making people miserable.

299
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,160
We fixed it up now.

300
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,521
Just leave us alone.

301
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:12,760
That's the best deed you can do.

302
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:20,760
When Yvonne says to Alyasha, go and I never want to see you again, it's just Yvonne worrying about personal involvement.

303
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,200
I think it's just an accident.

304
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,961
But if you don't, come and talk to me about it.

305
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,440
I have faith in your intuition.

306
00:30:22,841 --> 00:30:28,401
Yeah.

307
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,720
No, Earthly is a very Dostoevsky category.

308
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,401
Give me a page.

309
00:30:50,401 --> 00:30:51,920
But let me say something first.

310
00:30:51,920 --> 00:31:02,321
Now, I think it's the factor of the self, which is the one that is sensual and involved in the world.

311
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:09,601
And it's going to turn out, remember, Zossim already hints at this, that you have to get together the heavenly and the earthly.

312
00:31:09,841 --> 00:31:14,081
And I take those to be the positive names to the two factors.

313
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:22,161
Remember, how you define the set of factors in Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky determines whether you can get them together.

314
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,041
If you think that they are insect and angel, you can't get them together.

315
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:40,321
But if you think that they are the sort of embodied sensual aspect and the spiritual aspect, that's the earthy, heavenly, I think.

316
00:31:40,321 --> 00:31:42,321
But let's look at your quote.

317
00:31:47,761 --> 00:31:50,000
Okay, well, it may be related.

318
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,960
Well, let's think about it.

319
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,801
She's saying it's like Nietzsche's distinction between the Apollonian and the Dionysian in the birth of tragedy.

320
00:31:56,801 --> 00:32:02,000
And since, in fact, no one has read the birth of Tragedy here, unless you were in Sluga's course right now, is that what's happening?

321
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,841
How many are in Sluga's course?

322
00:32:03,841 --> 00:32:04,960
Nietzsche?

323
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,161
Hmm, I think we better talk about this later.

324
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:10,840
Okay, anybody else?

325
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:20,361
Okay, let's go on then, because I think the solutions are much more interesting than anything we've talked about so far.

326
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,240
But I want to catch up where we are.

327
00:32:34,361 --> 00:32:40,920
Now, what I'm doing is trying to skip the part that I jumped ahead about bread, which I'm just about to skip.

328
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,920
And here's where we were last time.

329
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,680
I'm now connecting up.

330
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:53,240
I remember I said the hippie communes fail, and people can't really just hold everything in common.

331
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:58,041
Even if the kibbutzes are still there, people are allowed their private property.

332
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:13,640
And that's because people are fundamentally selfish and trying to acquire possessions and protect themselves and their possessions.

333
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,641
I read you the quotes from 293 and 294.

334
00:33:18,201 --> 00:33:20,680
Never mind who says them.

335
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:24,521
We'll hear more from the mysterious visitor.

336
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,721
Now, what's going on?

337
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,801
Oh, yeah, we are.

338
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:30,760
Nothing's going on.

339
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:49,800
I read you the part about how man keeps apart at the very bottom, each in his own groove, holds aloof, hides himself, hides what he has, ends by repelling others and repelling himself, heaps up riches and so forth, and sinks into self-destructive impotence.

340
00:33:49,801 --> 00:34:06,801
I said that was all like a philosopher named Hobbes, who thinks that everybody feels vulnerable to everybody else and sort of builds themselves, tried to build themselves an unattackable place where they live and fight everybody else off.

341
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:12,721
Everybody's afraid of everybody else, and it's a very hostile way to live.

342
00:34:12,881 --> 00:34:28,481
It's got to do with how people get more and more riches and paintings and carpets and diamonds, and then they have to build more and more gated communities in which they are keeping off all the poorer people, and the distinction between the richer and the poorer get greater and greater, and everybody is in trouble.

343
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,560
That's the picture that now comes the interesting part.

344
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,881
It's the picture that Dostoevsky himself agrees with.

345
00:34:36,881 --> 00:34:39,920
He thinks that it is human nature.

346
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,121
Human nature is, as Hobbes said, nasty.

347
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:47,201
Human life is, as Hobbes said, nasty, brutish, and short.

348
00:34:47,201 --> 00:34:50,641
And Dostoevsky completely agrees with it.

349
00:34:51,281 --> 00:34:54,240
So no wonder communes don't work.

350
00:34:54,241 --> 00:34:57,361
Given human nature, they couldn't possibly work.

351
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:04,401
It's utopian to think that all these people could share their property and love each other.

352
00:35:05,761 --> 00:35:09,920
For human beings to be able to do that, what would have to happen?

353
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,121
They would have to be totally transformed.

354
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,881
Their human nature would have to be gotten rid of.

355
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:19,601
And they have to be given a new nature.

356
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,841
Does that sound familiar?

357
00:35:23,761 --> 00:35:24,960
That's Christian.

358
00:35:25,281 --> 00:35:28,321
That's Russian Orthodox Dostoevsky Christian.

359
00:35:28,321 --> 00:35:33,281
That is, people have to be reborn and become a new being.

360
00:35:33,281 --> 00:35:37,841
The original sinful human beings are sinful human beings.

361
00:35:37,881 --> 00:35:47,960
And if you want to build, you can build a utopian community on these sinful, selfish people like us.

362
00:35:47,960 --> 00:36:01,880
Only those Christian people who have been reborn and filled with love and giving instead of neediness and possessing things could possibly build such a community.

363
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:07,241
So that's what the mysterious visitor says in 293.

364
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,641
We have to hear a lot more about it.

365
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:25,161
But what we're talking about now is the demagicalizing of being reborn, of being saved, where human nature for existentialists is changeable.

366
00:36:27,321 --> 00:36:36,920
You can start with roughly the same nature for everybody, but your culture will change your nature, will give you a nature.

367
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:43,960
And then if you happen to be in a Christian culture, it'll give you a way to transform your nature radically.

368
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:59,801
And so here in the middle of 293, right where above where he's talking about how selfish every people normally are, he says, he's talking about what he calls about four lines down in the paragraph before the one I read.

369
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:04,680
It's a spiritual psychological process to transform the world, to recreate it.

370
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:07,801
Men must turn into another past, psychological.

371
00:37:07,801 --> 00:37:11,240
Now, there'sychologically is a funny word there.

372
00:37:11,241 --> 00:37:19,081
Dostoevsky hates psychologists because he thinks that they take for granted this selfish human nature.

373
00:37:19,241 --> 00:37:25,361
They don't have any clue about transformingness and transforming love.

374
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:29,680
And that becomes clear in the trial, which we'll read later.

375
00:37:29,841 --> 00:37:32,561
He makes fun of the psychologist.

376
00:37:32,881 --> 00:37:36,481
The problem is, he hasn't any word for what he's doing.

377
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:42,161
What he calls, they have to turn into another path psychologically, is what I'm calling.

378
00:37:42,161 --> 00:37:44,960
He has to turn into another path existentially.

379
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,801
That is, it's not.

380
00:37:46,881 --> 00:37:50,241
Psychology is just a study of how people are.

381
00:37:50,241 --> 00:38:05,281
You've got to have an existential view of people as not having a fixed nature, that being able to be reborn with a new nature before you can understand what's going on, and it's just too bad he has no word for it.

382
00:38:05,281 --> 00:38:09,121
So let's say they have to turn into another path existentially.

383
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:15,601
Until you have become really, in actual fact, a brother to everyone, brotherhood will not come to pass.

384
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:25,360
No sort of scientific teaching, no kind of common interest will ever teach men to share property and privileges with equal consideration for all.

385
00:38:25,361 --> 00:38:29,201
I mean, that's Dostoevsky's view.

386
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:37,121
Zosima is telling it, and Zosima heard it from this guy called the Mysterious Visitor, we'll get to in a minute.

387
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:44,321
And Zosima believes it, and Zosima generally speaks for Dostoevsky, who believes it.

388
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:54,481
Only if people are transformed can they really live in this kind of commune that he has in mind.

389
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,681
And we'll come back to that a lot later.

390
00:38:57,681 --> 00:39:03,600
But there's so many things in the air that you have to drop that one for the moment.

391
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,201
Let's see now.

392
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:06,240
Where am I?

393
00:39:10,361 --> 00:39:19,880
So he's anticipating here the failure of state communism in Russia and the failure, he would say, of the free market.

394
00:39:19,881 --> 00:39:26,361
As long as people are sinful and selfish and insecure, none of these systems will work.

395
00:39:26,361 --> 00:39:28,601
And what do you have to do then?

396
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:33,880
Well, you have to have some way of transforming everybody.

397
00:39:33,881 --> 00:39:36,440
That's a big job.

398
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:42,681
And that's an issue that comes up next in the book, or comes up early in the book.

399
00:39:42,681 --> 00:39:55,001
It's a story about transformation in a very obscure way, which I've only come to understand in the last few years, with lots of help from papers and so forth.

400
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,600
There's this obscure issue, which I imagine none of you understood.

401
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,281
I certainly couldn't understand.

402
00:40:00,281 --> 00:40:07,321
When they're fighting over the question of whether the church should become the state or the state should become the church.

403
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,321
That's the issue we're talking about.

404
00:40:09,321 --> 00:40:12,200
Maybe some of you can glimmer what it means.

405
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:19,641
Do you think anybody can any of you understand how that's related to this issue?

406
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:26,040
What would it be for the church to become the state, the state to become the church?

407
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,000
It's hard to tell.

408
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,321
I don't think anybody can figure it out because it's not obvious.

409
00:40:29,321 --> 00:40:34,920
But Dostoevsky's got something up his sleeve, and Yvonne has written a paper about it.

410
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:39,120
He's brilliant, Yvonne, eronic as he is and so forth.

411
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,080
It's got all the monks all upset and confused about it.

412
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,281
On page 74.

413
00:40:47,161 --> 00:40:48,920
Let's just begin in the middle here.

414
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,280
You are completely at the top, I mean, at the middle of the argument.

415
00:40:52,281 --> 00:40:53,761
The monks are all arguing.

416
00:40:54,721 --> 00:40:56,240
We can come in there.

417
00:40:53,241 --> 00:40:59,040
So he says, you're completely misunderstanding.

418
00:40:59,201 --> 00:41:04,641
It said, Father Pius, you must understand that the church is not to be transformed into the state.

419
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,720
That's Rome and its dream.

420
00:41:06,721 --> 00:41:11,121
See, that's the Grand Inquisitor, the church getting transformed into the state.

421
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:15,920
The church takes over the job of distributing the goods.

422
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:25,360
It becomes the communism and the planned economy and takes in all the bread and gives it out from each according to his ability to each according to his need.

423
00:41:25,361 --> 00:41:27,361
That's completely secularized.

424
00:41:27,361 --> 00:41:32,721
The Grand Inquisitor knows it is, wants it to be, said, We're done with this religious stuff.

425
00:41:32,721 --> 00:41:36,160
And that's what the Grand Inquisitor has been saying.

426
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:39,360
So he says, that's Rome and its dream.

427
00:41:39,361 --> 00:41:41,361
That is the third temptation of the devil.

428
00:41:41,361 --> 00:41:44,561
On the contrary, the state is to be transformed into the church.

429
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:51,040
We'll ascend and become a church over the whole world, which is the complete opposite of ultra-monk and some.

430
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,161
We know what that is.

431
00:41:52,161 --> 00:41:53,520
And your interpretation.

432
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,200
It is only a glorious destiny ordained for the Orthodox Church.

433
00:41:57,201 --> 00:41:58,881
You see, I've told you about this.

434
00:41:58,881 --> 00:42:00,881
The star will arise in the East.

435
00:42:00,881 --> 00:42:11,761
The Orthodox Church is going to save the world because the church, the state is going to become the church.

436
00:42:11,761 --> 00:42:13,521
Now, what does that mean?

437
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:23,201
Well, it means that somehow everybody in the state will get transformed and become Christian.

438
00:42:23,201 --> 00:42:26,721
And then they won't be selfish and isolated.

439
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:35,040
It's a funny slogan because Yvonne is doing weird things, but to say that the church?

440
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:41,561
No, the state becomes a church is to say you get Christian socialism.

441
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:49,401
You get a kind of socialism which is based on the fact that people have all been transformed already and aren't selfish anymore.

442
00:42:49,801 --> 00:42:52,601
I'll give you quotes that show you that that's what's happening.

443
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:57,641
On 73.

444
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:01,881
See, the trouble with the Grand Inquisitor is the people are not transformed.

445
00:43:01,881 --> 00:43:12,521
They're taken over in their selfishness and they're given a state that is the church turns into a state and it's all secular and it won't work and it's going to collapse and so forth.

446
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:19,480
But he's got this other view now where everybody's going to get transformed before they get together.

447
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,960
Oh, at the top of 73.

448
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,760
So just skipping first at the top, about five lines down.

449
00:43:30,761 --> 00:43:34,680
As for Rome, it's proclaimed a state instead of a church a thousand years ago.

450
00:43:34,681 --> 00:43:35,960
So there it's clear.

451
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,681
In Rome, the church has become a state.

452
00:43:38,681 --> 00:43:40,681
Now, what is the opposite?

453
00:43:40,681 --> 00:43:46,440
Well, this is what I call, what one could call, one people do call, Christian socialism.

454
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:55,481
At the middle of 73, middle of that big paragraph, Christian society is at present not ready and is only resting on some seven righteous men.

455
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,761
Because they are never lacking.

456
00:43:56,761 --> 00:44:02,121
It will continue unsleck in expectation and so forth.

457
00:44:02,761 --> 00:44:06,360
That's not what I'm expected to read, not that it's long.

458
00:44:06,761 --> 00:44:09,161
Well, let's see if it gets any more.

459
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:18,041
Even though it is long delayed until the end of the ages, it is ordained to come to pass and so forth.

460
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:27,761
And yeah, no, I don't, I mean, I don't understand the second time what I'm doing there, so I have to fix it.

461
00:44:23,241 --> 00:44:30,561
Every year there's always something more to fix.

462
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,521
I've got a better quote.

463
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,401
Don't worry.

464
00:44:35,681 --> 00:44:47,121
To make this view plausible, church becoming, the state becoming a church, and there being Christian socialism, Dostoevsky does a very clever move.

465
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:55,440
He remembers when he wants to make an argument, he, and convincing, he shows that it convinces the person he's arguing with.

466
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,881
That's one technique.

467
00:44:56,881 --> 00:45:03,601
That's when Alyasha admits to Yvonne he wouldn't create the world either, given the mess that it's in.

468
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:14,481
But now, the even stronger thing that Dostoevsky does is sometimes he puts the view that he thinks is the right view in the mouth of the enemy of that view.

469
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:23,600
Though the enemy of the view doesn't really know that he's doing this, you'll see it a lot later when there's a devil running around.

470
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,281
And maybe, yes, even Thursday.

471
00:45:27,281 --> 00:45:50,641
But here, the person he puts it in, into whose mouth he puts the right thing, is the sort of the Westernized guy, Milazov, whom you don't hear very often, sort of Enlightenment type, who spends a lot of his time in Europe, who's the enemy of all this Christian stuff.

472
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,640
He has him, say, on 74, very clever.

473
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:05,841
Now we're looking, and I'm looking for the evidence for why I think what I think about this church-state business, and here it is, about 15 lines from the bottom of 76.

474
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:08,160
Where?

475
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:12,681
Well, wait a minute.

476
00:46:12,681 --> 00:46:14,040
That is not what I want.

477
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,521
Don't worry, I'll find it.

478
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,121
74.

479
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,120
Ah, yeah, 74.

480
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:20,681
Okay.

481
00:46:21,881 --> 00:46:23,480
It's the bottom.

482
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:31,721
And Muazov is talking about what the sort of CIA people hobnobs with are saying.

483
00:46:31,721 --> 00:46:41,241
These are the spies who are going around in Europe trying to capture the nihilists and anarchists and people who are going to undermine the state.

484
00:46:41,241 --> 00:46:47,161
And Muazov talks to them, and what they tell Muazov is the following at the bottom of 74.

485
00:46:47,161 --> 00:46:55,960
We're not particularly afraid, said he, that's the CIA guy, of all these socialists, anarchists, infidels, and revolutionaries.

486
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:59,240
We keep watch on them and know all their doings.

487
00:46:59,241 --> 00:47:05,401
But there are a few peculiar men among them who believe in God and are Christians, and at the same time are socialists.

488
00:47:05,401 --> 00:47:07,801
These are the people we are most afraid of.

489
00:47:07,801 --> 00:47:21,561
So those are the people who, in some way, which we don't really understand until the end of the book, are going to turn the whole world into the right kind of Christianity.

490
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:29,001
And out of that, then they can make the right kind of government and the right kind of institutions.

491
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:40,520
That Dostoevsky sort of pulls this off at about the last ten pages of the book in a dazzling and amazing bunch of arguments.

492
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,040
But that's it.

493
00:47:41,201 --> 00:47:45,801
He's trying to show how, what was it, the star will arise in the east.

494
00:47:45,801 --> 00:48:04,241
That is, that Russia will become the center for the Christianizing of everything, of everybody in this non-Christendom way, not coercing everybody, but the source of this kind of spreading of the kind of love which transforms people.

495
00:48:04,241 --> 00:48:12,721
Until everybody gets transformed, then you'll have a, and then the church, the state will have become a church.

496
00:48:12,721 --> 00:48:22,640
So, and that's his answer to the how the economic problems of the world are going to be solved.

497
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,960
It won't be solved as long as people are sinful, selfish.

498
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,960
Okay, that's not exciting yet.

499
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,000
The only two really exciting ones are coming up, don't worry.

500
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,841
But it is confession and miracles.

501
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,160
We need one more before we get confession and miracles.

502
00:48:38,161 --> 00:48:40,881
This is a very quick and not very exciting one.

503
00:48:40,881 --> 00:48:50,560
Remember the issue about the community and the individual, which either everybody is in one universal ante, which I couldn't find in here, isn't it?

504
00:48:51,201 --> 00:48:59,761
Or they are each one as isolated as Abraham, directly talking to God and making no sense to anybody else, and so forth.

505
00:48:59,761 --> 00:49:01,040
And which is it?

506
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,201
Are people so desperate for community that they need one universal Christendom?

507
00:49:07,201 --> 00:49:12,561
Or are people able to live alone in isolation, in direct relation to God?

508
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,561
Or is there some third possibility?

509
00:49:14,721 --> 00:49:18,881
I'm sure there's a third possibility, but it just passes very fast.

510
00:49:18,881 --> 00:49:29,760
Remember, it's all supposed to be, or not all, but a lot of it in the Grand Inquisitor, sorry, in Father Zostima's, what isn't called confessions.

511
00:49:29,761 --> 00:49:30,881
What's it called?

512
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:31,760
Something.

513
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:43,320
Zostima is conversations and exhortations of Father Zosima.

514
00:49:43,321 --> 00:49:55,401
And in there, he tells what he thinks the right middle thing is, between total Christendom and isolated individuals on 311.

515
00:49:55,721 --> 00:49:57,800
And it's just, it's simply the following.

516
00:49:57,801 --> 00:49:59,480
I mean, it's not very exciting.

517
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:10,440
You need more than one person to be a church, to be a community, to live for human beings, and less than everybody.

518
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:17,800
And what he says is at the bottom of 3.11, and if two of you are gathered together, then there is a whole world, a world of living love.

519
00:50:17,801 --> 00:50:25,161
Embrace each other tenderly and praise God, for it is only in you two, if only in you two, his truth has been fulfilled.

520
00:50:25,161 --> 00:50:46,361
That means that as long as there's a community, a small community of people who love each other, and it's open to more people, it's not a kind of closed community, that it doesn't have to have in it everybody, then you've got something between the universal church and isolated individuals, and that's what Zosima is.

521
00:50:46,361 --> 00:50:55,000
He's always for these sort of local loving communities, and that's the early Christian community.

522
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:07,321
See, you've always remembered, too, that you've got in the background that he thinks that the Russian Orthodox Church captures the truth of the early Christian community that they lost because they got too much philosophy mixed up in them.

523
00:51:07,881 --> 00:51:10,920
Then they went off, became Roman Catholics, and that was bad.

524
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:15,320
Then they rebelled against the Roman Catholics in the opposite direction, and that was bad.

525
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:21,160
But the Russian Orthodox Church has captured the insights of the early Christian community.

526
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:26,401
So you keep getting these community of loving people as the solution.

527
00:51:23,241 --> 00:51:26,960
Okay, good.

528
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:32,721
Now we have time for something exciting, namely how he solves the confession problem.

529
00:51:33,281 --> 00:51:36,640
How many of you had a chance to read the Mysterious Visitor already?

530
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:37,761
Hope.

531
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:38,880
Nobody?

532
00:51:38,881 --> 00:51:39,920
One or two?

533
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,800
Did I not tell you to read far enough?

534
00:51:42,801 --> 00:51:46,560
I don't remember what I told you to read, so I may have done something wrong.

535
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,401
How far did I tell you to read?

536
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,641
293.

537
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,361
And is that before or after the mysterious?

538
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,761
Ah, it's right smack in the middle.

539
00:51:56,161 --> 00:51:57,920
Did I say 293?

540
00:51:58,881 --> 00:51:59,761
I did.

541
00:51:59,761 --> 00:52:01,920
That wasn't very smart of me.

542
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,041
In fact, that was very, very dumb.

543
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:13,201
Because 293 is right in the middle of the mysterious visitor or near the beginning, which begins on 291.

544
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,000
And now I don't know what to think.

545
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,601
Let me think a minute.

546
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:23,440
I will switch to confessions if confessions is earlier, but I'm pretty sure it's later.

547
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:36,561
Go ahead, ask something else, because I don't want to get too far in what you haven't read.

548
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,201
Yeah.

549
00:53:02,801 --> 00:53:04,001
Ah-huh.

550
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:08,160
She's saying, well, let me just put this in a bigger context.

551
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:18,761
What she's doing is really objecting to this idea that the Russian Orthodox Church has got this idea of small Christian communities.

552
00:53:19,401 --> 00:53:25,321
If it has it, it's only because it's got the monks, and then the monks don't seem to be the right kind of Christian community.

553
00:53:25,321 --> 00:53:30,120
They're not open to everybody, and they've got the wrong kind of authority, the authority of the elders.

554
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:44,521
You may be on to something about what's because now you're looking very puzzled because it isn't always the Russian Orthodox Church as it stands, which is existentialized Christianity.

555
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,440
We better get that clear.

556
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:52,841
I mean, it's much closer than Roman Catholicism or Luther Protestantism.

557
00:53:53,241 --> 00:54:01,481
The Russian Orthodox Church has preserved more of the existential, demagicalized truth of the early Christian community.

558
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:07,721
But every once in a while, he just thinks that the Russian Orthodox Church is wrong, and then there's some kind of clue.

559
00:54:07,721 --> 00:54:13,720
One clue is when he sends Zalyasha out of the monastery, never to come back.

560
00:54:13,721 --> 00:54:16,601
I mean, Zosima has done something wrong.

561
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:25,321
And that's, but the next clue is that the Russian Orthodox have the wrong view of confession, it turns out.

562
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,881
So the Protestants certainly have the wrong view.

563
00:54:27,881 --> 00:54:30,361
Well, sorry, the Catholics have the wrong view, he said.

564
00:54:30,361 --> 00:54:38,201
I mean, people just telling other people their sins and getting old what they have to do and getting forgiven or not forgiven.

565
00:54:38,201 --> 00:54:46,601
And certainly Kierkegaard has a wacky view, going along in this absolute isolation, suspending the ethical.

566
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:55,760
But the monks have a actual Russian Orthodox Church is just like the Catholic Church on confession, I've been told.

567
00:54:56,801 --> 00:54:58,560
Are there any Russian Orthodox people here?

568
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,520
They should definitely tell me if I'm wrong.

569
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:10,321
I've been told that they have the same notion of confession to one individual priest that the Roman Catholics do.

570
00:55:10,321 --> 00:55:12,960
And in that case, Dostoevsky just thinks they're wrong.

571
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:21,201
And when he existentializes confession, which is what I'm going to talk about, even though you haven't read it, I'm afraid, he changes it.

572
00:55:21,201 --> 00:55:23,841
So I'm going to go on talking about this.

573
00:55:23,841 --> 00:55:28,481
I can't just throw away the time just because I was stupid and gave you the wrong assignment.

574
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:36,321
That's because every time I teach this, there's a different book, and the pages keep getting changed, and I sometimes lose it trying to keep track.

575
00:55:36,321 --> 00:55:40,481
So I'm going to talk about confession now.

576
00:55:41,761 --> 00:55:46,000
And there are really three levels of the answer.

577
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:46,960
I was just telling you that.

578
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:52,321
There's the real Russian Orthodox view of confession, which isn't what Dostoevsky wants.

579
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:58,960
And because you'll see, he thinks that wouldn't have any existential significance.

580
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:08,801
And then there's what ought to be the Russian Orthodox view, which is this existential truth that they should have preserved, primitive early Christianity.

581
00:56:08,801 --> 00:56:13,601
And it's illustrated by Zosima's view of confession.

582
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:17,521
And that turns up on 312.

583
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:24,241
I'll try to tell you things that.

584
00:56:24,241 --> 00:56:25,120
Oh, does it?

585
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,240
Well, let's hope so.

586
00:56:26,241 --> 00:56:27,520
Just a second.

587
00:56:29,841 --> 00:56:30,481
Well.

588
00:56:40,361 --> 00:56:42,201
Well, there's another mystery.

589
00:56:42,201 --> 00:56:43,641
Where is it?

590
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,001
I don't know.

591
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,440
But I've got other ones.

592
00:56:46,761 --> 00:56:48,360
I've got backup quotes.

593
00:56:48,361 --> 00:56:49,000
So let's see.

594
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,120
This seems to be wrong.

595
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,641
312.

596
00:56:57,241 --> 00:57:02,041
I'm looking for what Zosima does when he does confession.

597
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,000
Well, that's not it.

598
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,881
So let's look at 158.

599
00:57:13,881 --> 00:57:14,520
Okay, good.

600
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,281
Here's what I was looking for.

601
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,281
This is how Zosima does it.

602
00:57:18,361 --> 00:57:26,120
Notice it's not the way the Roman Catholics do it or the Lutherans do it, nor even the way the Russian Orthodox do it.

603
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:36,840
It's what Dostoevsky thinks is the right way to do it, because it captures the existential meaning of confession, which we haven't seen yet, but which we are going to see pretty soon.

604
00:57:36,841 --> 00:57:50,281
Anyway, as a rule, every evening after services, the monks flocked into Father Zosima's cell at the bottom of 158 and confessed about their sins of the day, their sinful thoughts, temptations, their disagreements, if there had been any.

605
00:57:50,281 --> 00:57:57,401
Some confessed kneeling, their elder absolved, reconciled, exhorted, imposed penance, blessed, and dismissed them.

606
00:57:57,401 --> 00:58:05,641
It was against this general confession that the opponents of elders protested, maintaining that it profaned the sacrament of confession.

607
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:14,281
See, that's the clue that the way the confession was done in the Russian Orthodox Church was not the way Zosima did it, and people were protesting.

608
00:58:14,281 --> 00:58:20,440
And what was Zosima doing different was he was getting everybody into a kind of group confession.

609
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:26,560
In the old days, when I was teaching this here in Berkeley, in I guess the 70s, there were these all these encounter groups.

610
00:58:26,881 --> 00:58:29,521
I don't think the counter groups exist anymore, do they?

611
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,401
Probably the word doesn't even mean anything to you anymore.

612
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:49,281
There were groups of students who got together to confess to each other in groups of what they were really and how they felt about each other and how they felt about whatever in life and so and sort of tried to understand and forgive each other.

613
00:58:49,281 --> 00:59:11,600
I guess the nearest thing we've got to that now is what happened in South Africa, where they had reconciliation groups, where people confessed that they had killed and tortured other people and that then they regretted it, and people listened to them and forgave them, and it was all public confession.

614
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:19,841
Dostoevsky believes you've got to have public confession for it to capture the existential meaning of confession.

615
00:59:19,841 --> 00:59:30,641
And that's what he's going to, and now he's going to try to convince you of that on 336 or something.

616
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,480
I'm surprised it's back there.

617
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,520
Is it really?

618
00:59:39,841 --> 00:59:41,440
You will see.

619
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:46,401
Not in the least.

620
00:59:46,401 --> 00:59:47,840
It isn't back there.

621
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,440
Shouldn't be back there.

622
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,081
Oh, how about 291?

623
00:59:58,881 --> 01:00:01,841
Nothing is on 291 of any interest.

624
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:05,920
Okay.

625
01:00:06,241 --> 01:00:28,040
Anyway, all that quote was supposed to say is that Dostoevsky is going to give you a psychological, existential story about the true meaning of confession, why it has to be, why people have to confess, to whom they should confess, what happens to them when they don't confess, what happens to them when they do confess.

626
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:39,001
All of this is told by the mysterious visitor to Zosima, and all of this is in this section beginning on 291, where Zosima is reporting on it.

627
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,200
So I'm going to start talking about it.

628
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,841
It's not a big deal plot thing.

629
01:00:45,161 --> 01:00:47,561
I wouldn't give away things like that.

630
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,120
And it's important to read it.

631
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:58,841
It's the story of a guy who is this visitor to Zosima who committed a murder.

632
01:00:58,841 --> 01:01:00,600
I don't know how many years before.

633
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,200
I have a feeling about 20.

634
01:01:02,201 --> 01:01:03,800
Maybe it says in here.

635
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:10,841
And got away with it because they arrested the wrong guy.

636
01:01:12,681 --> 01:01:21,561
The guy really killed his girlfriend or mistress or that he killed the woman he loved out of jealousy.

637
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:33,481
And he got away with it because they arrested the wrong person and before they could have a trial, where presumably the truth might well have come out, this guy died in jail, the wrong one they arrested.

638
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:37,800
But since they arrested him for some reason or other, they thought he was the murderer.

639
01:01:37,801 --> 01:01:44,841
So they never suspected Mikhail, this guy, the one who comes to visit Zosima, who is the real murderer.

640
01:01:44,841 --> 01:01:53,161
Now, then we have the whole story about what it's like to be a murderer, according to Dostoevsky, or to have committed a terrible crime.

641
01:01:53,361 --> 01:01:54,801
And it's interesting.

642
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:58,801
Any of you seen Woody Allen's crimes and misdemeanors?

643
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,560
No, that's too bad.

644
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:01,440
Well, good.

645
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:06,720
I mean, it's Woody Allen sort of taking back the Dostoevsky.

646
01:02:06,721 --> 01:02:14,000
He knows his Dostoevsky, and there's sort of parallels between what happens in there and what happens in the story of the Mysterious Visitor.

647
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:14,800
You want to say something?

648
01:02:14,801 --> 01:02:15,520
Yeah.

649
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,440
That's the church with W State.

650
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,281
Yes, I think that's right.

651
01:02:45,281 --> 01:02:51,200
People, but if you find me the passage, when you don't necessarily, you don't have to find it right now.

652
01:02:51,201 --> 01:02:52,480
If you can, that's fine.

653
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,001
Because I have to see it in order to see how it relates to this.

654
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,960
Or maybe you'll see how it relates to this when we go further.

655
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:07,601
Because I think it should be the same here as when the church becomes a church.

656
01:03:08,161 --> 01:03:10,080
Because it's the right understanding.

657
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:18,241
We're getting the right understanding of confession here, and we would certainly have the right understanding of confession if the state became a church.

658
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,721
So, but so wait and see.

659
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:24,960
Okay, now, so the guy gets away with this murder.

660
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:41,321
In the crimes and misdemeanours, the guy gets away, he also murders his mistress, but he has the mafia to do it instead of doing it himself, and he gets away with it because he just because he has the right mafia connections.

661
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:50,281
And then what happens in here is that he is haunted by the memory of the murder.

662
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:54,600
And he tries to deal with his guilt by suffering alone before God.

663
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:58,040
And in the Woody Allen movie, he's obsessed with this murder.

664
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,401
He gets more and more upset about it.

665
01:03:59,401 --> 01:04:00,521
Any of you seen it?

666
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:05,560
And he is more and more tempted to confess.

667
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,401
You've all read the Brothers Karamatsov.

668
01:04:07,401 --> 01:04:12,201
Remember how Raskolnikov is always sort of haunted by the murder?

669
01:04:12,201 --> 01:04:13,801
And did I say the Brothers Karamatsov?

670
01:04:13,881 --> 01:04:23,881
You've all read Crime and Punishment, and you remember how Raskolnikov feels that he has to confess, only he doesn't get there alone, only pushed by Sonia.

671
01:04:23,881 --> 01:04:34,680
But here, we have another case of somebody who commits a murder and feels more and more guilty and more and more haunted by it, more and more tempted to confess.

672
01:04:34,681 --> 01:04:43,160
Then the Woody Allen movie goes off in an entirely anti-Dostoevsky direction, and this guy simply gets over it after a while.

673
01:04:43,321 --> 01:04:45,401
Doesn't feel guilty anymore.

674
01:04:45,801 --> 01:04:47,321
Doesn't bother him anymore.

675
01:04:47,321 --> 01:04:51,881
He goes back to being a good husband and father and a donor.

676
01:04:52,201 --> 01:04:57,641
The movie begins with some big party for him because he's a big philanthropist and everybody likes him.

677
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,001
And that's that.

678
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:02,040
This is just a destruction of this story.

679
01:05:02,281 --> 01:05:06,760
But here in this story, he's haunted by the murder.

680
01:05:06,761 --> 01:05:12,120
And he tries to deal with it just the way the Grand Inquisitor said you should try to deal with it.

681
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:22,361
The Grand Inquisitor said that Jesus said you should try to deal with it, namely alone, and Kierkegaard said, alone before God.

682
01:05:22,361 --> 01:05:26,161
So on 297 now, where I'm afraid you aren't.

683
01:05:26,161 --> 01:05:27,680
You know, you could have read beyond what I said.

684
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:28,960
I don't want to feel too guilty.

685
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:30,241
Go on reading.

686
01:05:23,241 --> 01:05:33,600
Anyway, but I wish I had told you.

687
01:05:34,321 --> 01:05:50,080
So he thinks in the middle of the page, at last he began to be bitterly and ominously haunted by the blood of his murdered victim, by the young life he had destroyed, by the blood that cried out for vengeance.

688
01:05:50,081 --> 01:05:59,040
He began to have awful dreams that being a man of strength, he bore his suffering a long time thinking, I shall atone for everything by this secret agony.

689
01:05:59,041 --> 01:06:06,800
It's exactly what the Jesus figure in Kierkegaard say you should do if you've done something terribly wrong.

690
01:06:07,921 --> 01:06:14,401
But he understands that you have to confess in public.

691
01:06:14,401 --> 01:06:16,480
And that's where it gets interesting.

692
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,960
Skipping down about 10 lines.

693
01:06:18,961 --> 01:06:20,560
He confessed to me.

694
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,321
That's not, never mind, confess that.

695
01:06:22,401 --> 01:06:24,401
You could just say he told me, Zosima said.

696
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:26,880
He told me that he had thoughts of killing himself.

697
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:34,560
But he began to be haunted by another idea, an idea which he had at first regarded as impossible and unthinkable.

698
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:38,241
Though at last it got such a hold on his heart that he could not shake it off.

699
01:06:38,241 --> 01:06:44,640
He dreamed of rising up, going out and confessing before all men that he had committed murder.

700
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:48,401
For three years, this dream pursued him, haunted him in different forms.

701
01:06:48,401 --> 01:06:54,480
At last he believed with his whole heart that if he confessed his crime, he would heal his soul and would be at peace forever.

702
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:58,880
But this belief filled his heart with terror, for how could he carry it out?

703
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:14,200
And then he sees Zosima at a duel, and in the duel, Zosima throws away his gun, and this inspires him to go see Zosima, and that inspires him to carry out this confession.

704
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:16,760
We've got to go slow here.

705
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:26,520
What is exactly bothering him that makes him have to have do a confession?

706
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:29,241
Well, that's the most interesting thing.

707
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:40,440
What's really making him miserable is that people don't know who he really is, because he really is a murderer.

708
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:46,281
And they think he's a nice, upstanding father, a member of the community, and so forth.

709
01:07:46,281 --> 01:07:48,920
But this is on the middle of 297.

710
01:07:48,921 --> 01:07:50,920
He says, children came.

711
01:07:50,921 --> 01:07:54,040
How dare I love them, teach them, educate them?

712
01:07:54,041 --> 01:07:55,800
How can I talk to them of virtue?

713
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,080
I have shed blood.

714
01:07:57,081 --> 01:07:58,440
They were fine children.

715
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:00,200
He longed to caress them.

716
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:03,640
But I can't look at their innocent faces.

717
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:05,480
I am unworthy.

718
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:10,520
And so, but his wife and children don't know who he really is.

719
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:16,920
And if they knew he was really a murderer, they certainly wouldn't want to be living with him and caressed by him and loved by him.

720
01:08:16,921 --> 01:08:18,200
And he knows that.

721
01:08:18,201 --> 01:08:23,720
So everything he's doing is a kind of pretense and a kind of affront to them.

722
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,880
And he is in total isolation.

723
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:33,000
It's very much like the woman in Hiroshima Manamur, who can't, it doesn't mean, it doesn't even, she didn't do anything bad.

724
01:08:33,001 --> 01:08:34,760
Her lover was just killed.

725
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:39,321
But what's similar is just that she is in total isolation.

726
01:08:39,321 --> 01:08:45,640
She has this desire for intimacy, but she can't tell anybody what's really important to her and who she really is.

727
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:46,920
She's never told her husband.

728
01:08:46,921 --> 01:08:48,121
She's never told anybody.

729
01:08:48,121 --> 01:08:52,080
She had to get drunk and slapped around to tell the Japanese man.

730
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:55,361
And he's in the same situation.

731
01:08:56,161 --> 01:09:02,241
He can't relate to anybody as who he really is, so he's in total isolation.

732
01:09:02,241 --> 01:09:03,440
Go ahead.

733
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,321
Oh, she's ahead of the story.

734
01:09:20,321 --> 01:09:21,440
She's done the reading.

735
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,720
That's cheating.

736
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:23,281
Okay.

737
01:09:24,241 --> 01:09:27,040
So, yes, she's, but wait till we get there.

738
01:09:27,041 --> 01:09:28,640
She's asking the question.

739
01:09:29,201 --> 01:09:32,480
So he's going to go confess in a minute, you'll see.

740
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:36,720
And to the whole, to all of his associates.

741
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:42,800
And what happens next is, to his sort of consternation, they don't believe him.

742
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:48,880
They think he's a nice man and a pillar of the community and he's going to church, presumably, and everything.

743
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,480
He couldn't be a murderer.

744
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:53,361
Now, I'm not going to say yet why.

745
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:58,560
Just says he's got taken care of that, taking care of your objection.

746
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,760
But we have to get there.

747
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:00,560
We will.

748
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,080
Let's see.

749
01:10:03,361 --> 01:10:06,000
So he feels he can't love anybody.

750
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:12,241
Nobody can love him because they don't even know who he is, and he is in a terrible state.

751
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:19,840
And now he's in, he is, we have to sort of keep track of lots of things, in existentialized hell.

752
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:25,040
Because it turns out, existentialized hell is isolation.

753
01:10:25,041 --> 01:10:29,201
And so first we hear it from him, and then we'll hear it from Zosima.

754
01:10:29,201 --> 01:10:36,880
He says on 298, about two-thirds down, I know it will be heaven for me, heaven the moment I confess.

755
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,401
14 years I've been in hell.

756
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:39,720
I want to suffer.

757
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:42,680
I want to take my punishment and begin to live.

758
01:10:43,161 --> 01:10:46,281
You can pass through the world doing wrong, but there's no turning back.

759
01:10:46,281 --> 01:10:50,680
Now I dare not love my neighbor and even my own children, so forth.

760
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:59,640
And if you look back at Zosima when you read this, you see that he has drawn a similar conclusion about hell.

761
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:04,760
He says on 297, let's hope.

762
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,241
Oh, no, it couldn't be Zosima, could it?

763
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:09,000
No, that's not right.

764
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,800
Where is Zosima on this?

765
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,401
312.

766
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:18,920
I hope.

767
01:11:18,921 --> 01:11:21,080
You never know what's going to show up.

768
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:26,121
Okay, he says, what is hell?

769
01:11:27,161 --> 01:11:30,440
Of hell and hellfire at the bottom of 312.

770
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,600
Fathers and teachers, I ask, what is hell?

771
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:35,401
I maintain that it is the suffering of being unable to love.

772
01:11:35,401 --> 01:11:38,920
Remember, he can't love anybody because they don't know who he is.

773
01:11:38,921 --> 01:11:48,920
Once in an infinite existence, in measurable time and space, a spiritual creature was given on this earth the power of saying, I am and I love.

774
01:11:49,241 --> 01:11:56,920
And then, but if you can't do that, I mean, there's nothing more to say here, but if you can't do that, then you suffer.

775
01:11:57,081 --> 01:11:59,880
That suffering is being in hell.

776
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:02,920
It's also, you'll see in a minute, being in the hands of the living God.

777
01:12:02,921 --> 01:12:06,680
This is all being existentialized.

778
01:12:06,921 --> 01:12:08,200
Let's see now.

779
01:12:08,201 --> 01:12:11,241
297.

780
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:14,600
Keep track of too many issues here, but I will do it.

781
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:22,200
But when he sees Zosimi in the duel, he decides to confess.

782
01:12:22,201 --> 01:12:26,000
He says at the bottom of 297, looking at you, I made up my mind.

783
01:12:23,321 --> 01:12:30,480
And that is an aside.

784
01:12:31,041 --> 01:12:39,680
People, I've got to say this too, and the things I have to say before you get, but the more I can say that it doesn't tell you more about what you're reading, the better.

785
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:54,800
Well, it's interesting that it was seeing Zosim at the duel that made him make up his mind to confess, because one of the morals of the book, which you have to keep your eyes open for, is that people are responsible for lots of things they're not aware of, good and bad.

786
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:00,080
Here's Zosim is doing a very important good deed, and he doesn't even know he's doing it.

787
01:13:00,081 --> 01:13:03,600
There are people in the book who are doing very important bad deeds.

788
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,520
We'll hear about one next time.

789
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,200
And they don't know they're doing it.

790
01:13:07,201 --> 01:13:20,401
So although Zosim is wrong, that he's responsible for all the suffering in the world, the truth in it is you are responsible for a lot more suffering and a lot more good in the world than you realize.

791
01:13:20,401 --> 01:13:24,960
And it's being shown here, and it gets shown every once in a while.

792
01:13:24,961 --> 01:13:28,960
Okay, so people, and he says suffering is hell.

793
01:13:28,961 --> 01:13:29,920
I just read that.

794
01:13:30,081 --> 01:13:30,480
Did I?

795
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:31,840
No, is there another one?

796
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,120
No, that's fine.

797
01:13:34,401 --> 01:13:44,000
And I just want to say, being in hell is not a metaphor of which, you know, you could say, boy, it was hell, meaning, you know, the exam was very hard or something.

798
01:13:44,001 --> 01:13:48,161
Being in hell, this is being in hell, existentialized.

799
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:52,161
That is, there is no other hell from Dostoevsky's point of view.

800
01:13:52,161 --> 01:14:00,241
When you understand what hell is, you understand that it's this being in a position where people can't love you and you can't love them.

801
01:14:01,201 --> 01:14:03,600
And that's what we've already seen.

802
01:14:03,921 --> 01:14:11,960
And now, I think it's perfect timing, but I'll just go on a tiny bit, make sure where we are.

803
01:14:12,041 --> 01:14:16,920
Typically, we are okay, 299.

804
01:14:16,921 --> 01:14:18,361
We might as well see that too.

805
01:14:18,361 --> 01:14:32,840
Another thing that gets de-magicalized at the bottom of 299, he says, it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of a living God, he reads in the Bible.

806
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,361
He read it and flung down the book.

807
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:35,880
He was trembling all over.

808
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:37,241
An awful text, he said.

809
01:14:37,241 --> 01:14:39,401
There's no denying it, and so forth.

810
01:14:39,401 --> 01:14:43,480
That is, that's what it is to fall into the hands of the living God.

811
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:53,080
It's to have the kind of isolation and suffering that he's having, had had, still having, he hadn't confessed when he read the passage yet.

812
01:14:53,081 --> 01:14:59,160
And so, and now, one last thing, so you can see how this all fits together.

813
01:15:00,361 --> 01:15:13,401
If his problem is isolation, then confessing to one other person, a priest, who's sworn to keep your secret, that's what priests are when they take confessions, isn't going to help a bit.

814
01:15:13,401 --> 01:15:22,281
You've got to confess to your friends, your family, and the public if you're going to get a confession that works.

815
01:15:22,281 --> 01:15:30,840
So now we've got an existentialized story of why people who do something wrong need to confess and why they need to confess to the whole community.

816
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:32,281
Then we've got to have her question.

817
01:15:32,281 --> 01:15:36,201
It's a cliffhanger till next time, but nobody in the community believes him.

818
01:15:36,201 --> 01:15:37,640
So what good does it do?

819
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:38,680
We'll find out.

820
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:39,960
Okay, now you read it.

821
01:15:40,121 --> 01:15:41,081
And read this too.

822
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:43,640
I won't feel guilty next time.
