1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,480
The first page in front of you is sample final exam question one, two hours.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:15,640
Identify as precisely as possible, give author, identify each speaker under situation or and or situation where relevant.

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:24,201
And I have to put that in because sometimes the quotes from Nietzsche haven't got a speaker and/or situation the way they would from the brothers or so forth.

4
00:00:24,201 --> 00:00:28,921
Anyway, if it's the brothers, you should give the speaker and situation.

5
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:35,881
If it's Kierkegaard, you can say if you want to, who's the pseudonym talking, since it's always the same one.

6
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:37,721
However, that's not a big deal.

7
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:43,481
And state briefly the significance of 10 out of the following, 12 of the following.

8
00:00:43,481 --> 00:01:02,761
Of course, it won't be these, but I'm going to just, to give you an idea of what kind of answer we want, which is roughly a page of a blue book, not a big essay, but enough to show that you understand not only where the quote comes from, but why we would choose it.

9
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:04,601
That is, why it's significant.

10
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,601
That's the important part.

11
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:16,601
If you got it completely wrong, but you got it wrong in an intelligent way where it could have, you might have well made the mistake, but you get the significance, that's the important part.

12
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay, let's just run through them together and give you kind of practice and a sense of what's expected.

13
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:23,961
So here we go.

14
00:01:23,961 --> 00:01:30,281
You are really angry with me for not having appeared to you in a red glow with thunder and lightning, with scorched wings and so forth.

15
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:35,560
You are wounded in the first place in your aesthetic feelings, and secondly, in your pride.

16
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:40,761
Those who come in late, come up front and take a copy of this, which is what we're reading together.

17
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:42,520
It's over here.

18
00:01:43,481 --> 00:01:45,921
Okay, who's talking?

19
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,761
The devil, right?

20
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:49,360
In what book, of course?

21
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:55,921
And in the Brothers Karamatso, of course.

22
00:01:55,921 --> 00:01:59,041
And I'm not sure myself.

23
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:04,161
It doesn't seem to me to have a very interesting significance now that I look at it.

24
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,080
But I can make up one.

25
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:10,401
I could make up an A answer.

26
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:28,400
That is that Yvonne has this kind of pride that his ideas are very valuable and his essay like on the geological cataclysm is very important.

27
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:39,360
And the devil is constantly making fun of the lofty side of Yvonne and his philosophical ideas.

28
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:48,240
And the devil is the external lackey or stupid or whatever side of Yvonne.

29
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:55,680
And Yvonne is, in a way, happy to externalize that.

30
00:02:56,161 --> 00:03:10,000
On the other hand, it sort of wounds his pride that he's got this crazy lackey parody side of his personality at all.

31
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,481
I don't think that's a terrific good question.

32
00:03:12,481 --> 00:03:20,161
And so therefore, my answer is to, what's wrong with my answer is that it's too far from the text.

33
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:22,240
But then the trouble is, I can't think of any answer.

34
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,360
Can any of you that's any closer to the text?

35
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:28,240
I wouldn't, I think we, I wouldn't put that on again.

36
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,440
Let's try this one.

37
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,161
Much better.

38
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:32,281
I came here to find a wicked soul.

39
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:36,441
I felt drawn to evil because I was base and evil myself, and I found a true sister.

40
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:38,201
I found a treasure, a loving heart.

41
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,360
She has pity on me now.

42
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,481
Who talking?

43
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,841
Alyosha.

44
00:03:42,841 --> 00:03:45,481
In the brothers, to whom, or about whom?

45
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,161
About Grushenka.

46
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:50,841
And now, the significance of that one is a good, clear one.

47
00:03:50,841 --> 00:03:53,800
Anyone want to volunteer a significance?

48
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,761
What would you say on the exam about that one?

49
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,921
Well, that's very clear and important.

50
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:04,440
Why is this episode where he goes to her?

51
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,240
What does he mean that he went out of being evil?

52
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:20,680
Well, he means that he went out to her out of lust and because he was rebelling against God and religion and everything because the Thasma had not performed a miracle.

53
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,081
And why is this so important?

54
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,481
That what's he saying?

55
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:41,400
He's saying, in effect, that instead of this situation, they love each other, agape love, and he doesn't say it in this sentence, but what's important is: why do we choose this sentence?

56
00:04:41,721 --> 00:04:47,320
The significance of it is it's part of this episode in which Alyasha performs a miracle.

57
00:04:47,320 --> 00:05:05,000
Namely, he saves Grushenka by way of his love and because she was feeling despised by him, and she saves him by way of her love because he was feeling rebellious and angry about the lack of a miracle.

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,841
If anybody has any comments or objections or anything, just interrupt, because this is going to help you get a grip on this.

59
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:13,841
So, okay, three.

60
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:25,360
No person who has learned to exist as the individual, no person who has learned that to exist as the individual is the most terrifying thing of all will be afraid of saying it is the greatest.

61
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,240
Who?

62
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,080
Kierkegaard.

63
00:05:28,081 --> 00:05:30,961
And why is that significant?

64
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:33,680
Anybody want to try this one?

65
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:35,521
Boy.

66
00:05:35,521 --> 00:05:37,761
Okay, I'm ready to take the whole example.

67
00:05:37,761 --> 00:05:39,120
Anyway, here we go.

68
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:46,961
So, for Kierkegaard, being an individual means having a defining commitment.

69
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:50,161
And why would that be terrifying?

70
00:05:50,161 --> 00:05:53,120
Well, there are really two, I think, answers.

71
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,041
I think grading it, I'd be happy with one or the other.

72
00:05:57,041 --> 00:06:00,560
But it doesn't say two, so you aren't really required.

73
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,281
But there's two things terrifying about it.

74
00:06:03,601 --> 00:06:04,481
What?

75
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,041
Yes, the sword hanging over the head of the beloved.

76
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,041
That is the vulnerability of it.

77
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:21,841
The fact that you put your whole identity and world on the line, and it's all now very risky.

78
00:06:21,841 --> 00:06:23,841
And that's terrifying.

79
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:30,640
And what there's something, I think, in fact, if I went back and found this sentence, I suspect it means something else.

80
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:31,520
Yeah.

81
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,560
Good.

82
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,841
Say a little tiny bit more.

83
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,761
Why is that terrifying?

84
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:43,601
Not following the ethical.

85
00:06:44,881 --> 00:06:45,761
That's right.

86
00:06:45,761 --> 00:06:52,241
You recognize the importance of the ethical, and you recognize that you're deviating from it.

87
00:06:52,240 --> 00:07:01,361
But you're deviating from it in a way that your deviation isn't a temptation to lower immediacy, which is where you should return to the ethical.

88
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,440
You're deviating from it in a way that the ethical itself is the temptation.

89
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:25,561
Remember the sort of gay example parallel: that if you were a gay person loving somebody in Copenhagen in 1850, the temptation would be to go straight, and the terrifying thing would be to do this thing, which everybody says is awful and unethical.

90
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,240
You're suspending the ethical.

91
00:07:27,241 --> 00:07:29,321
You're going against the ethical.

92
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:35,161
And so, in Abraham's case, just to finish it, what's the terrifying thing that he's doing?

93
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:44,521
Yeah, but put it in his terms, and put it in the ethical terms that he would have to use if he talked to himself.

94
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,721
Remember?

95
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,840
He's a murderer.

96
00:07:46,840 --> 00:08:01,881
Abraham can only say, when he talks to himself and makes it intelligible, he can only say he's a murderer, just like the gay person can only say, I'm a depraved, unnatural sick person or whatever.

97
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:13,161
So it's terrifying to go against the ethical when you respect the ethical, and you've got to respect the ethical because it's what enables you to make any sense of what you're doing.

98
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:22,601
Four, and if the suffering of the children go to swell the sum of sufferings which was necessary to pay for the truth, then I protest that the truth is not worth such a price.

99
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,800
Who says?

100
00:08:24,121 --> 00:08:24,680
Good.

101
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,281
Yvonne, in what part of the book?

102
00:08:26,281 --> 00:08:31,001
Now it's important to talk about the situation.

103
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:32,521
Rebellion, right.

104
00:08:32,521 --> 00:08:39,321
And that's the situation in which he's telling Alyasha why he rejects the world.

105
00:08:39,641 --> 00:08:45,241
And he's, then you have to say something about what does it show?

106
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:46,601
Why is it important?

107
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:55,041
Well, Yvonne's making a strong case that if you were outside the world and you had a strong sense of justice, you wouldn't join the world.

108
00:08:55,041 --> 00:09:00,401
But what's wrong with that way of putting it?

109
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,760
That's right.

110
00:09:03,761 --> 00:09:05,120
He's not outside the world.

111
00:09:05,121 --> 00:09:10,641
It's not up to him to figure out, to decide whether to accept the world or not.

112
00:09:10,641 --> 00:09:23,041
And I think that would be already a complete answer, but if you wanted to just go over the top, what's the right thing to do instead of condemn the world as unjust from outside it?

113
00:09:25,121 --> 00:09:27,681
What should Yvonne do?

114
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,961
What does Alyasha do about the injustice of the suffering?

115
00:09:36,161 --> 00:09:36,800
Exactly.

116
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,161
Try to fix them.

117
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:49,281
In your local, whatever bad things are happening around you that you could do something about, you should stop complaining about how unjust the world is and do something about.

118
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:52,081
That's certainly the whole answer.

119
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,721
Everything has been good except for the first question.

120
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,161
Let's try the fifth.

121
00:09:56,161 --> 00:10:05,600
Unconditional and honest atheism is simply the presupposition, the way he poses his problem, being a triumph achieved finally and with great difficulty by the European conscience.

122
00:10:05,601 --> 00:10:07,200
I wonder if that's in the reading.

123
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,121
Does that sound familiar?

124
00:10:09,121 --> 00:10:12,161
I have a feeling that I took that out of Nietzsche this time.

125
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:13,201
It's Nietzsche.

126
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:28,001
That is, finding with great difficulty by the European conscience, being the most faithful act of 2,000 years of discipline for truth, in the end, forbids itself the lie in faith in God.

127
00:10:28,641 --> 00:10:31,681
I mean, I had, there are passages like that.

128
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,441
So what's going on here?

129
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:43,641
That after 2,000 years of discipline for truth, they forbid themselves the lie of faith in God.

130
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:48,121
It's a very interesting idea, and we discussed it a lot.

131
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,561
Anybody, what's the point of this?

132
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,841
Yeah.

133
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:03,641
That's right.

134
00:11:03,641 --> 00:11:06,360
So it's the we have killed God story.

135
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:07,800
We did it ourselves.

136
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:18,841
Christianity overcame itself by being determined to find the truth about our desires and about the world, so to speak.

137
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:27,961
And the truth about is that we would love to have an answer and a meaning to this world and the chaos of it, but there isn't any.

138
00:11:28,281 --> 00:11:29,080
Okay.

139
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:37,240
What exactly but the person who gives up the universal to grasp something still higher that is not the universal, what does he do?

140
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,560
Can this be anything but temptation?

141
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,521
Well, actually, that's repetitious.

142
00:11:42,521 --> 00:11:43,961
What's that about?

143
00:11:44,601 --> 00:11:46,921
Kierkegaard, and what's the issue again?

144
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,561
It's another version of the teleological suspension of the ethical.

145
00:11:53,401 --> 00:12:01,320
Number seven, why is it he still does not understand how much I'm really ready to bear for his sake?

146
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,761
Why, why doesn't he know me?

147
00:12:02,761 --> 00:12:05,161
How dare he not know me after all that has happened?

148
00:12:05,161 --> 00:12:07,161
I want to save him forever.

149
00:12:08,121 --> 00:12:10,681
That's something we never talk about in lectures, but that's all right.

150
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,200
The quotes are not supposed to be what I talked about in lectures.

151
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,521
Who's talking to me?

152
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,080
Katerina.

153
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,001
Yeah, about whom?

154
00:12:20,641 --> 00:12:22,241
About Dimitri.

155
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:34,481
And she's sacrificing herself for Dimitri out of pride, and she's suffering for it, which is the kind of suffering which I forget our translation calls lacerations or strings.

156
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,521
Lacerations, right?

157
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:36,721
Lacerations.

158
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,681
It's her kind of lacerations.

159
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:47,841
She wants to sacrifice herself for him to show that she's better than he is, better than everybody.

160
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:51,361
And that's her kind of pride.

161
00:12:51,361 --> 00:12:53,281
Oh, and that's enough.

162
00:12:53,281 --> 00:13:01,041
I mean, you could go on to compare it to Yvonne, her existential doubles kind of pride, but I think you certainly don't need to.

163
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,800
Okay, let's see.

164
00:13:03,121 --> 00:13:07,600
We know it well, the world in which we live is ungodly, immoral, inhuman.

165
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:15,761
We have interpreted far too long in a false and mendacious way, in accordance with the wishes of our reverence, which is to say, according to our needs.

166
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:16,560
Hmm.

167
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,001
Sound familiar.

168
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:18,881
Who?

169
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,560
Nietzsche, again, it's really the truth thing again.

170
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:31,041
Because we couldn't face the way the world is ungodly, immoral, and inhuman, and we needed meaning.

171
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,041
We were addicted to meaning.

172
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,921
We lied to ourselves.

173
00:13:35,921 --> 00:13:42,481
And remember, he says God is our, he says it as a question: could it be that God is our longest lie?

174
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,161
That's what he's, in fact, claiming there.

175
00:13:47,121 --> 00:13:50,401
Okay, God has pity on me and is calling me to himself.

176
00:13:50,401 --> 00:13:54,241
I know I'm dying, but I feel joy and peace for the first time after so many years.

177
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,481
There was heaven in my heart from the moment I had done what I had to do.

178
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,720
Now I dare to love my children and to kiss them.

179
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,681
That's a good one.

180
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,840
Who?

181
00:14:05,881 --> 00:14:07,641
The mysterious visitor, right?

182
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:09,001
The mysterious visitor.

183
00:14:09,001 --> 00:14:10,761
And in the brothers, of course.

184
00:14:10,761 --> 00:14:17,241
And the situation is he's talking to Alyasha after he's confessed.

185
00:14:17,241 --> 00:14:35,561
And the important thing about it is that once he's confessed, he can be joyful because he's now back in touch with his children and his wife and everybody whom he has been, in effect, lying to all these years because they didn't know he was a murderer.

186
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,441
Not that they really believe he is a murderer, but because he isn't really like that anymore.

187
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:49,321
But the important thing is he now feels that it's really him that they love, and that makes it heaven in his heart.

188
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,841
And that's important because that's to say, that's a kind of existentializing move.

189
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:02,041
To say what it is to be in heaven is to be feeling the joy of connectedness to the people you care about.

190
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:03,881
So you love that.

191
00:15:05,161 --> 00:15:12,760
Now, 10, he is constantly making the movements of infinity, but he makes it with such accuracy and poise that he's continually getting finitude out of it.

192
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,040
And at a second, would one suspect anything else?

193
00:15:17,641 --> 00:15:20,440
Kierkegaard, well, who's he talking about?

194
00:15:23,321 --> 00:15:23,960
Yeah.

195
00:15:24,281 --> 00:15:25,480
Well, there's some disagreement.

196
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:36,520
It's about both the night of resignation and the night of faith, but it's strictly the who's making the movement of infinity in such a way as to get finitude out of it.

197
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:38,520
The night of faith.

198
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,040
That is, he has an infinite passion for something finite.

199
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,921
He's got the actual embodied other person there to love.

200
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,480
And whereas, who's he contrasting it with?

201
00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:03,440
The knight of resignation, who makes the movement of infinite resignation and doesn't get infinity out of it, doesn't get back in touch with the temporal embodied finite.

202
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:16,080
That's the lady in Hiroshima Monomur that illustrates what it would be like to make the movement of infinity and not get back in touch with individual finite people.

203
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:19,680
Okay, philosophy cannot and should not give us an account of faith.

204
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:28,641
It should understand itself and know just what it is indeed to offer without taking anything away, least of all cheating people out of something by making them think it is nothing.

205
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,960
I don't think I read that, but you did.

206
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,241
Anyone recognize any Kierkegaard?

207
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,000
What's he talking about?

208
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,440
What's wrong with philosophy?

209
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,921
But how does it cheat people out of something?

210
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:45,361
Yeah.

211
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:06,561
Okay, good.

212
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:07,680
That's absolutely right.

213
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:12,080
A little bit would be better maybe to say it says that faith is lower immediacy.

214
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,600
He's against the idea that there's something higher than faith.

215
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:25,520
And that's the sense in which you take something very high up and you make it seem the lowest sort of thing.

216
00:17:26,161 --> 00:17:27,360
That's good.

217
00:17:27,361 --> 00:17:29,040
Okay, next.

218
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,241
When we criticize something, this is no arbitrary and personal event.

219
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:38,121
It is at least very often evidence of vital energies in us which are growing and shedding a skin.

220
00:17:38,361 --> 00:17:47,480
We negate, we must negate, because something in us wants to live and affirm something we perhaps do not know or see as yet.

221
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,881
Now, I'm not sure that's on the list of what you were supposed to eat.

222
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,480
Anyone recognize it?

223
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,600
It is.

224
00:17:52,601 --> 00:17:53,561
Okay, good.

225
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,240
But who is it?

226
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,401
You look like, you know, you were nodding.

227
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,401
It's Nietzsche, right?

228
00:17:59,401 --> 00:18:06,680
And it's Nietzsche telling us again that you ought to outgrow whatever your skin is.

229
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:13,080
You've got to, because life is constant overcoming, constant outgrowing.

230
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:24,040
And something that you thought you needed before, because you were too weak to face reality, you now have gotten strong enough and to leave it behind.

231
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:29,240
And that's what a human being at its best does.

232
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:33,081
Okay, that's any questions now about that overall?

233
00:18:33,161 --> 00:18:38,600
It's supposed to have left you happier or sadder about the two hours you're going to have to put up with.

234
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,360
I hope it gives you a sense that you could do it.

235
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:48,360
And if anything, the quotes we're going to give you are going to be better, at least better than that first one.

236
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:51,321
That is, it should be clear where they come from.

237
00:18:51,321 --> 00:18:52,440
It's not a trick.

238
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,001
And it should be clear what the significance of them is.

239
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:57,881
Ask yourself always, well, why do they put that on there?

240
00:18:57,881 --> 00:18:59,641
It's not just any old quote.

241
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:03,720
Something important about the book is coming out in that quote.

242
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,921
Okay, anything else?

243
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:08,440
If not, I'm going on to the next on the back of what you've got.

244
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,480
The question two, one hour.

245
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:26,641
So we decided that the way to do it, after much discussion, is to give you these six questions in advance, and you can think about what you would have said to any of the six.

246
00:19:26,641 --> 00:19:33,680
It's a way of reviewing and discussing the course with other people in the course.

247
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:41,040
And then we will choose two on each of the two exams.

248
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,360
It may be the same two, it may not.

249
00:19:43,361 --> 00:19:44,480
We don't promise.

250
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,641
It may be one of them, but not the other.

251
00:19:46,641 --> 00:19:52,960
So there's no way to tell which of the two you're going to get, but that's the point.

252
00:19:53,601 --> 00:20:03,760
The trade-off is we save you from surprises, but you have to think about the whole course in order to be prepared for that question.

253
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,921
Any question about that?

254
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:16,401
Okay, we had to go through that at some point, and it's better to do it while you've got this in your hands than not.

255
00:20:16,401 --> 00:20:22,000
Okay, so now I'm going to get my notes and talk about what we should talk about today.

256
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,401
I didn't give you guys the notes.

257
00:20:28,401 --> 00:20:35,680
Now, I've got a big problem, and as I told you already, it's the brief habits problem.

258
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,121
I didn't call it that.

259
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:48,080
I'm going to have to review what I said at Mulford because when I came in, just before I left to come over here, I looked and it was still pending.

260
00:20:48,321 --> 00:20:55,121
We can't wait because it's an important piece that goes into explaining Nietzsche at this point.

261
00:20:55,121 --> 00:21:00,960
And it's so important that it's not a big disaster to have to do it again.

262
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,561
I'll try to do it a little faster than I did last time.

263
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:10,041
But because again, let me just ask and assure myself: so, how many people were not at the lecture at Mulford where I talked about this?

264
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,560
Well, that is just amazing.

265
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,641
Okay, well, I can understand why.

266
00:21:13,641 --> 00:21:18,200
I mean, I switched the time on you, and it's not your fault if you couldn't make it.

267
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,040
So, we're going to do it again.

268
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:38,360
The interesting quote, which most people don't notice or pay much attention to, but which I think is very important, is on page 236, aphorism 295.

269
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:45,080
And I haven't talked about it, have I accepted on that day?

270
00:21:45,321 --> 00:21:49,080
Those of you who weren't there that day, we haven't read this, I think.

271
00:21:49,081 --> 00:21:51,240
Okay, then, is that right?

272
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,480
Okay, so let's read it.

273
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:59,480
I love brief habits and consider them an inestimable means for getting to know many things and so forth.

274
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:05,881
My nature is designed entirely for brief habits, and that's we don't need to read that either.

275
00:22:05,881 --> 00:22:12,121
But now, at the top of 237, I always believe that here is something that will give me lasting satisfaction.

276
00:22:12,121 --> 00:22:18,200
Brief habits have a faith, have this faith of passion, this faith in eternity.

277
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,881
Whenever you see eternity, you have to think about this is important.

278
00:22:21,881 --> 00:22:23,881
This is something about forever.

279
00:22:24,841 --> 00:22:28,521
And you also ought to be puzzled: what's Nietzsche doing thinking about forever?

280
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,720
So, we have to go on.

281
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,241
And that I am to be envied for having found and recognized it.

282
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,921
And then he gives a lot of nice, how much it's nice, and he doesn't desire anything else.

283
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,360
But one day, its time is up.

284
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:49,600
The good thing parts for me, not as something that's come to nauseate me, but peacefully and sated with me as I am with it.

285
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:54,240
It's as if we had reason to be grateful to each other as we shook hands to say farewell.

286
00:22:54,561 --> 00:23:05,280
Even then, something new is waiting at the door, along with my faith, this indestructible fool and sage, that this new discovery will be just right and that this will be the last time.

287
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,840
Now that's amazingly interesting.

288
00:23:07,841 --> 00:23:09,361
And what's he talking about?

289
00:23:09,361 --> 00:23:15,840
Well, all sorts of things, but I think the simplest thing before we read his list is it's a kind of infatuation.

290
00:23:15,841 --> 00:23:26,960
It's something which, when you're in it, seems terrific and seems to be something you will never want to give up and so forth, but it goes away.

291
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:36,641
And when it goes away, that's fine, too, because you will have lived whatever you can get out of it.

292
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:39,520
And he says, this is what happens to me.

293
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,121
And then you get this amazing list.

294
00:23:41,121 --> 00:23:46,080
Dish it with dishes, ideas, human beings, that's the infatuation.

295
00:23:46,081 --> 00:23:53,520
Cities, poems, music, doctrines, ways of arranging the day, lifestyles.

296
00:23:53,520 --> 00:24:06,320
In any of those, you can sort of throw yourself into them as if they were the ultimate satisfying and fulfilling thing and get a great deal of satisfaction out of them for a while.

297
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:08,001
That's the brief habit.

298
00:24:08,801 --> 00:24:13,760
And they even look to you like they are eternal, that they're going to last forever.

299
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:25,280
And you're foolish enough, and you'd have to be a fool, to take the next infatuation as if it was going to last forever since the last one thought you looked like it would, but didn't.

300
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,721
But that you can't get over that.

301
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,161
You are just a fool and sage.

302
00:24:28,161 --> 00:24:30,481
The next one also looks like this is really it.

303
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,960
This is going to last forever.

304
00:24:31,601 --> 00:24:36,200
I've never been in such a wonderful, satisfying relationship or whatever.

305
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,361
But you should know, and it will happen, that you will what?

306
00:24:40,361 --> 00:24:41,480
Outgrow it.

307
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,840
That's what's behind all this.

308
00:24:42,841 --> 00:24:46,121
It's the Nietzschean outgrowing story.

309
00:24:46,121 --> 00:24:51,961
And then, and he, Nietzsche, being a free spirit, says, enduring habits I hate.

310
00:24:51,960 --> 00:25:02,680
I feel as if a tyrant had come near me, as if the air I breathe would thicken when events take such a turn, as it appears that they will inevitably give rise to enduring habits.

311
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,240
And so that, so he's got an interesting position.

312
00:25:07,801 --> 00:25:19,881
He doesn't want to be trapped in one relationship or gourmet love or love of the city like Berkeley, say, or Paris.

313
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:25,800
But he also doesn't want to think that every minute there's something new.

314
00:25:25,801 --> 00:25:37,800
He says at the end, that most intolerable, to be sure, and the terrible par excellence would be for me a life entirely devoid of habits, a life that would demand perpetual improvisation.

315
00:25:37,801 --> 00:25:41,720
I don't know whether he thinks that that's even better.

316
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:57,720
And you see in Breathless, in a way, Michel Pueka, who is the ultimate pop free spirit, doing perpetual improvisations, but you also see him in the middle of one of his brief habits, namely the one he's altogether involved in is with her.

317
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:04,121
She keeps wanting to know whether it's going to last forever, and she's afraid that it might, and that scares her.

318
00:26:04,121 --> 00:26:05,561
She's afraid it might not.

319
00:26:05,561 --> 00:26:06,760
That scares her.

320
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,961
He isn't scared at all.

321
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:17,760
He's enjoying every minute of it while he's in it, and he's not making any promises about the fact that it'll last forever, but he's planning it as if it would last forever.

322
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,041
They're going to go to Italy together.

323
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,321
They're going to steal cars together.

324
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:21,840
They're going to go to prison together.

325
00:26:23,361 --> 00:26:24,401
So I don't know.

326
00:26:24,401 --> 00:26:29,760
I think Nietzsche, I don't think Nietzsche has an opinion about this, but I'm not sure.

327
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,520
Whether you ought to have a lot of brief habits or a few or whatever.

328
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:44,800
I think he thinks that it's a good thing, I have a feeling, to get involved in a brief habit so you can outgrow it.

329
00:26:44,801 --> 00:26:58,480
If you had total improvisation, if everything was like Michelle is in the background, sort of making up his life and his identity every few minutes, then you wouldn't really be able to outgrow anything.

330
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:10,960
So I think the ideal thing is to actually throw yourself into a brief habit and stay with it as long as it works and get the most out of it.

331
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:18,000
But when it isn't working anymore, then you have to be free to drop it and move on.

332
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,840
I say, look at page 88, so let's look at page 88.

333
00:27:24,161 --> 00:27:30,800
He's talking about it again, the middle of page 88, the end of the top paragraph of aphorism 14.

334
00:27:31,121 --> 00:27:37,360
Gradually we become tired of the old and of what we safely possess, and we stretch out our hands again.

335
00:27:37,361 --> 00:27:42,720
Even the most beautiful scenery is no longer short of our love after we've lived in it for three months.

336
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,601
And some more distant coast attracts our avarice.

337
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:48,481
Possessions are generally diminished by possession.

338
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,921
It's the same point again, that that's a brief habit.

339
00:27:51,921 --> 00:28:02,840
Three months, you love it on the Amalfi coast or on Lake Como, and then even something as gorgeous as that gets to be a habit.

340
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,561
Like maybe looking at the Bay and the Golden Gate Bridge.

341
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:14,200
I'm still dazzled after 30 years, but I know people who are totally glase and don't even bother to raise the shades on that side of the house.

342
00:28:14,841 --> 00:28:17,720
They've gotten involved in something else, presumably.

343
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:30,440
So now, it looks when you read this, in this course, and me at least, coming out of Attita Guardian story, that a brief habit must be something like an unconditional commitment.

344
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,240
That it gives your life meaning, and it gives your world an identity.

345
00:28:36,121 --> 00:28:39,561
But then there are several things that are peculiar about it.

346
00:28:39,561 --> 00:28:43,321
One is, well, there's all one thing to feel peculiar about it.

347
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:45,720
There's no talk about grief.

348
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:52,200
If a brief habit were giving you an identity in a world, then you'd have to go into the collapse of that.

349
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,121
You'd have to go through grief in order to get a new identity and world.

350
00:28:56,121 --> 00:29:01,240
So there's something very different about a brief habit than an unconditional commitment.

351
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,520
And we have to find out what that is.

352
00:29:04,841 --> 00:29:15,800
That you have no sense of anguish and vulnerability because whatever it is that brief habits are, there's plenty of them around.

353
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:20,840
And another one is waiting at the door as soon as this one goes away.

354
00:29:23,641 --> 00:29:28,600
You can see this on 337 in Aphorism 375.

355
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,480
We are cautious, we modern men.

356
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,321
Modern men is another, there are lots of names, by the way, for free spirits.

357
00:29:35,321 --> 00:29:41,720
Modern men, it can be, we philosophers, that would really confuse you if I don't warn you.

358
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:49,521
Because philosophers are in general the Greek Platonic bad guys for Nietzsche, as for Dostoevsky.

359
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:59,760
But when he says we philosophers, he's talking about free spirits who are not really doing philosophy, just a way of talking.

360
00:30:00,081 --> 00:30:06,641
So we philosophers, we modern men, are cautious about ultimate convictions.

361
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:21,921
Our mistrust lies in wait for these enchantments and for, well, let's go on, deceptions of conscience, that's like Christianity, that are involved in every strong faith, every unconditional yes or no.

362
00:30:22,161 --> 00:30:25,600
There's even a term conditional.

363
00:30:25,921 --> 00:30:40,961
And so, then only, but better skipping down is the jubilant curiosity of one who has formerly stood in his corner, but who was driven to despair by his corner.

364
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:48,800
I have to say something about that, and now delights and luxuriates in the opposite corner, in the boundlessness in what is free as such.

365
00:30:48,801 --> 00:30:54,800
Well, remember, looking at something from a corner is looking at it from some perspective, some interpretation.

366
00:30:54,801 --> 00:31:06,401
So you've got this corner, that living in some city is the most satisfying thing, or living with some woman or man is the most satisfying thing.

367
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:13,121
And then you get driven to despair in that corner.

368
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:22,641
Now, despair can't mean this kind of eternal experience, which is that my life never meant anything and would never mean anything.

369
00:31:22,641 --> 00:31:25,281
See, that's just not a brief habit kind of experience.

370
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,600
There's another waiting at the door.

371
00:31:27,601 --> 00:31:29,601
So it shouldn't be despair.

372
00:31:29,601 --> 00:31:34,200
It should be, I don't know, sadness or something, melancholy.

373
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:34,841
I don't know.

374
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:40,760
Something that happens to you when you finally get bored with the person you're with.

375
00:31:40,760 --> 00:32:02,040
Or I said, I remember in Mulford, an artist like Licaso paints in one style, throws himself into it, thinks painting everything blue in his blue period is just the right thing to do, and you can have such fun and so exciting, but then at some point gets tired of it.

376
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:07,800
Not nauseated by it, just tired of it, and maybe frustrated.

377
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:15,720
And then you want to get a new corner, say Cubism, or another city, or somebody else to live with.

378
00:32:15,721 --> 00:32:18,681
And that's his idea of what it is to be free.

379
00:32:18,681 --> 00:32:20,521
Let me see if I need to read more.

380
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,121
I don't think so.

381
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,480
No, that's the idea.

382
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,801
Now, now comes the interesting part to me.

383
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:45,721
So, how come the brief habits don't get you in the position of wanting to hold on to them forever, the way your unconditional commitment and your identity and your world do?

384
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,640
It took me years to see this.

385
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:52,601
Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think so, because a lot of quotes more and more fall into place.

386
00:32:52,600 --> 00:33:04,601
That is, if you're searching for meaning, and remember for Nietzsche, we're meaning addicts, then when you find something that gives your life meaning, you want to hold on to it forever.

387
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,161
It becomes who you are.

388
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:14,761
And meaning just brings with it the desire for stability, eternity, and so forth.

389
00:33:14,761 --> 00:33:17,680
Well, what's he getting out of these brief habits if not meaning?

390
00:33:17,921 --> 00:33:22,561
I mean, coming at it from Kierkegaard, it looks like the brief habits must be getting him meaning.

391
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:29,521
But if you describe them the way I've been describing them and you read his weird list of them, it looks like it's not meaning.

392
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:34,160
It's something else, which I'm going to call, and he sometimes calls wonder.

393
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,841
That is, you find, let's say, this other person exciting.

394
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,720
What else?

395
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:44,080
Romantic is dangerous.

396
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,561
That's going into Kierkegaard territory.

397
00:33:47,281 --> 00:33:51,760
Exciting, surprising, whatever.

398
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,680
Let me show Poikard is.

399
00:33:53,681 --> 00:33:56,480
What breathless, the whole movie is folks.

400
00:33:56,801 --> 00:34:02,960
Full of surprises, making every day enjoyable, satisfying.

401
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,720
Any of those words will do.

402
00:34:04,721 --> 00:34:06,561
Anything but meaning.

403
00:34:06,881 --> 00:34:10,881
Meaning leads to grief when your word overcollects.

404
00:34:10,881 --> 00:34:26,401
But wonder is something that you just enjoy while you're in it, but it doesn't last because what's essential to what makes it wonder is what makes it wonderful is that it's new and surprising and different.

405
00:34:26,401 --> 00:34:32,560
And of course, it's built right into the wonder story in a way that it isn't built into the meaning story.

406
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,841
You're going to get bored with it.

407
00:34:33,841 --> 00:34:35,040
I read you the passage.

408
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:45,760
After three months, any beautiful countryside, which is just filling you with excitement and every new perspective is terrific, is going to get boring.

409
00:34:45,761 --> 00:34:48,721
And that's what happens.

410
00:34:48,721 --> 00:34:59,201
In the wonder business, when things are fascinating and exciting and marvelous and so forth, then you will ultimately outgrow them.

411
00:34:59,201 --> 00:35:05,641
And there's always plenty of other things in the world that will be wonderful and exciting and fascinating.

412
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:13,080
And you just, they are waiting for you at the door, you're waiting for them, and you just go into the new one.

413
00:35:13,401 --> 00:35:34,841
And this is, for instance, on 346, number 382, The Great Health, where he talks about in the second paragraph, second sentence, we argonauts of the idea, with more daring perhaps than is prudent, have suffered shipwreck and damage often enough, but that isn't grief.

414
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:48,040
He said, I'll read you a passage where he says specifically it's not grief, but are to repeat healthier than ones like to permit us, dangerously healthy, ever again healthy.

415
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,121
This is all outgrowing talk.

416
00:35:50,841 --> 00:35:56,120
And so let's skip down, and that you find a world so overrich in what is beautiful.

417
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,401
See, this is wonder talk.

418
00:35:57,401 --> 00:36:08,361
A world so overrich in what is beautiful, strange, questionable, terrible, and divine, where divine means for him just more exciting.

419
00:36:08,361 --> 00:36:12,921
Because the divine, even the divine, is something about which you can laugh, remember.

420
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:15,640
Not the sacred in the old meaning of that.

421
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:23,240
So, divine, that our curiosity as well as our craving to possess it has got beside itself and so forth.

422
00:36:23,241 --> 00:36:31,801
This is just a description of what it is to go into one of these brief habits and find it terrific.

423
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:38,520
And it's what's meaning is deep.

424
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,361
That's another way to put this.

425
00:36:40,361 --> 00:36:42,841
And that's this business of lasting.

426
00:36:42,841 --> 00:36:44,760
And he's against deep.

427
00:36:44,761 --> 00:36:46,120
Wonder isn't deep.

428
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,681
What's fascinating, but Michelle Poitard isn't deep.

429
00:36:46,761 --> 00:36:52,881
When she looks at his face, she doesn't see deep thoughts and so forth.

430
00:36:53,201 --> 00:37:04,161
There's nothing behind it except whatever is on the surface and he relates to whatever he comes across in terms of what's on the surface.

431
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:10,001
This is what the Greeks and the artists do, Nietzsche says on page 38.

432
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,520
Bottom paragraph.

433
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,401
Oh, those Greeks.

434
00:37:12,401 --> 00:37:14,000
By the way, these are the Homeric Greeks.

435
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,681
Every time you read Greeks, you have to ask yourself, I hope you're learning to do it.

436
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:26,160
Does he mean the Homeric Greeks, which he likes very much, or does he mean the Athenian Greeks, who he dislikes, Socrates, and all those decadents?

437
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,680
These are the undecadence.

438
00:37:27,681 --> 00:37:29,440
Oh, those Greeks, they knew how to live.

439
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:39,601
What is required for that is to stop courageously at the surface, the fold, the skin, to adore appearance, to believe in forms, tones, words, in the whole Olympus of appearance.

440
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,641
Those Greeks were superficial out of profundity.

441
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,361
And then skipping way down, they were artists.

442
00:37:45,361 --> 00:38:00,321
Because I think artists are the ones who are most sort of out of serious, not into seriousness, not into meaning, not into deep, but into enjoying and throwing themselves into appearances, having brief habits.

443
00:38:06,401 --> 00:38:08,480
That's all marvelous.

444
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:14,480
On page 76, just a short sentence at the bottom of 76, Alphorism 2.

445
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:25,841
Standing in the midst of, what does it say, discordant concord of things and this whole marvelous, uncertain, and rich ambiguity of existence.

446
00:38:25,841 --> 00:38:31,680
So existence is marvelous, you could say, rather than meaning, if you want, for the free spirit.

447
00:38:33,241 --> 00:38:46,600
So you find, in jargon, if you find a partner you like, you like them because they're wonderful, but not because they're adorable, technically speaking, because that's Beatrice.

448
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,120
Dante adored Beatrice.

449
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,321
That puts Beatrice in the center of his world forever.

450
00:38:51,321 --> 00:38:57,720
And it's not, he didn't find Beatrice fun, exciting, marvelous, and so forth.

451
00:38:57,721 --> 00:39:00,201
That was not his relation to her.

452
00:39:00,201 --> 00:39:01,560
And that's the difference.

453
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,001
And Nietzsche is trying to do this amazing thing.

454
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,720
I mean, you just, sometimes it makes my hair stand on end.

455
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:08,681
It's so interesting.

456
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:18,841
I mean, for a culture that's been addicted to meaning for 2,000 years, he's inventing another way of life that's satisfying, but not meaningful.

457
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:25,881
You have to, if you're going to tell people to be free spirits, you've got to give them a new sense of what it would be like to live that way.

458
00:39:25,881 --> 00:39:40,601
And he's coming along, he's discovering the fascinating, wonderful, marvelous, free meaning, early Greek way of life and trying to get people to appreciate that again.

459
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:45,721
So you want your partner to be endlessly surprising and fun to be with.

460
00:39:45,721 --> 00:39:47,960
You want to be fun when you're with them.

461
00:39:49,321 --> 00:39:57,641
But if you break up in the right way, namely when you finally get bored with each other, then nobody's got any recriminations.

462
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:06,440
You and this brief habit shake hands and say goodbye without anybody feeling bad, and you're ready for the next brief habit.

463
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,081
Yeah.

464
00:40:19,201 --> 00:40:20,000
I couldn't hear you.

465
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,921
Talk, I have to talk louder.

466
00:40:23,201 --> 00:40:23,841
Yeah?

467
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,361
Interesting.

468
00:40:35,361 --> 00:40:39,681
Okay, wow, that's a very, very deep, interesting question.

469
00:40:39,681 --> 00:40:43,520
And I think Camus is like Nietzsche, knew Nietzsche.

470
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:58,641
I think he is into appreciating what would it be sort of on the beach in Algeria and so forth, which you can't have an unconditional commitment to the beach, but you could certainly have a brief habit and enjoy it for a long time and then get tired of it and go to Paris.

471
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:07,841
But the interesting thing is that you're saying, why do I say that Nietzsche and Camus are existentialists, particularly since Nietzsche, since Camus said he wasn't?

472
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:09,601
Okay, that's a tough one.

473
00:41:09,921 --> 00:41:15,921
I think that strictly speaking, you can use the words any way you please.

474
00:41:15,921 --> 00:41:22,561
So here's, if you think, I'm going to talk about this in the last lecture, what existentialism is, for asking me to do it now.

475
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:45,361
If you think that existentialism is something inside the Judeo-Christian tradition, which has got a meaning and eternity and a monotheistic God at the center of it, and the question is really how to existentialize that, which is what Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky are doing, then Nietzsche's anti-existential.

476
00:41:45,361 --> 00:41:52,560
But if you think that existentialism wants to, well, what am I going to say?

477
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,281
Let me think.

478
00:41:58,401 --> 00:42:26,280
If you put them under a different umbrella, how do you live in the West after the death of God that is after the the supreme being Platonized kind of Christianity is over in such a way as to get in touch with your pre-Christian roots, that's the Homeric stuff, but also in such a way as to have profited from having gone through the Judeo-Christian.

479
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:36,521
That's Nietzsche's story, because that's the business of we are now convalescing from our greatest overcoming and that makes us stronger and more joyful.

480
00:42:36,841 --> 00:42:42,040
Joyful, cheerful is more than joyful, is let's up.

481
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,320
I'll come back to it at the end.

482
00:42:43,321 --> 00:42:48,440
I mean there is just lots of different definitions, but they're all in the same area.

483
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:56,041
But you reminded me of something I remember I said in Moper and I haven't ever said it before and I don't even know who cried, but I'll say it again.

484
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:02,440
I wonder if joyful isn't belonging with Dostoevsky and Kierkegaard.

485
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,361
Kierkegaard talks about bliss.

486
00:43:04,361 --> 00:43:07,641
Dostoevsky makes joy the crucial thing.

487
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:13,641
I think it's probably important that Nietzsche had to talk always about cheerful.

488
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:24,841
Cheerful is a sort of a scale down, not forever, not serious, not having found the ultimate meaning kind of emotion.

489
00:43:24,841 --> 00:43:28,200
And I think that's important for him that he's saying cheerful.

490
00:43:28,201 --> 00:43:39,401
The gay science, it's, well, Berlisch in German, it would be, yeah, fun, cheerful, and so forth.

491
00:43:39,401 --> 00:43:44,361
It's not Freud in German, which is this big deal joyfulness.

492
00:43:45,241 --> 00:43:46,921
How many know Beethoven's Ninth Symphony?

493
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:51,120
That's the first word of the Ninth Symphony, Freude Schoener, and so forth.

494
00:43:51,120 --> 00:44:01,440
That's, even though Beethoven isn't Christian, that's sort of, I think, this big mono vision of the modern world all heading toward better and better.

495
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:03,440
And it's therefore joyful.

496
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,400
Anyway, let's go back to this.

497
00:44:06,401 --> 00:44:08,000
I'm off in a thing.

498
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,760
I'm just wondering always to myself.

499
00:44:09,761 --> 00:44:12,321
And does Nietzsche ever say joyful?

500
00:44:12,321 --> 00:44:13,200
Keep your eyes open.

501
00:44:13,201 --> 00:44:15,921
And if you find him saying joyful, tell me about it.

502
00:44:16,401 --> 00:44:19,121
Mostly it's cheerful that I know of.

503
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:19,921
Okay.

504
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:38,241
So and so when what's been wonderful leaves, your world doesn't collapse, so you don't go into grief because you never built your world around whoever or whatever made it rich or made it satisfying and so forth.

505
00:44:39,841 --> 00:44:49,361
And if you don't demand deep, unconditional meaning, you'll find something wonderful and fascinating always at the door.

506
00:44:49,361 --> 00:44:52,001
There's plenty of opportunity.

507
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:08,161
And if your love lasts a whole lifetime, this comes up, then that's just fine too.

508
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:15,601
It isn't something that you should be congratulated on, but you shouldn't be, you know, feel sorry for people whose love lasts a whole lifetime either.

509
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:27,440
If it stays fascinating and exotic and exciting and growing and changing and full of surprises for two people's whole life, I'm sure Nietzsche would say, Well, happy you.

510
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,001
You had one grief habit and it was a long one.

511
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,121
But it's not going to be any better.

512
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:36,200
That would be Christian to say, ah, yes, and it looked like that.

513
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:37,640
It was forever and that made it better.

514
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:44,361
Think of those poor people who have only, who have, whose lives are made up of, say, 20 short stories instead of one novel.

515
00:45:44,361 --> 00:45:49,960
Well, Nietzsche would say, I think that either one is equally okay for a free spirit.

516
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:55,721
The important thing is to get into the non-meaning business.

517
00:45:55,721 --> 00:46:06,521
And so, and it can happen in three months or three years or 30 years or whatever that you give up your brief habit, or you can have it forever.

518
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,280
No, sorry, not forever.

519
00:46:08,281 --> 00:46:10,361
You can just have it for a long time.

520
00:46:10,361 --> 00:46:15,321
And it might last your whole lifetime, but it won't have the eternity story in it.

521
00:46:16,281 --> 00:46:29,161
So, and he says explicitly, I was happy to see, I didn't say this in Wilford because I hadn't found it yet, 231 that it's not got grief in it.

522
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:35,081
At the bottom, 231 Aphorism 289.

523
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,520
It's again about a brief habit.

524
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:46,521
Consider how every individual is affected by an overall philosophical justification of his way of living and thinking.

525
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,440
He experiences it as a sun that shines especially for him.

526
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,240
He said, remember that you can have brief habits for doctrines.

527
00:46:53,241 --> 00:47:02,921
I think that means you can find some philosophy that makes you happy, and then you feel warm, and so forth, and so forth.

528
00:47:03,881 --> 00:47:11,560
And let's see, it makes him independent of praise and blame, self-sufficient, rich, liberal with happiness and goodwill.

529
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,881
See, happiness is okay, like cheerfulness.

530
00:47:13,881 --> 00:47:23,841
Incessantly, it refashions evil into good, leaves all energies to bloom and ripen, and does not permit the petty weeds of grief and chagrin to come up.

531
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:29,440
In the end, one explains, How I wish that many such new suns were yet to be created.

532
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,321
That's a neat one.

533
00:47:30,321 --> 00:47:32,641
So you don't get caught in grief.

534
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:45,361
Many new suns is, S-U-N, is other beautiful experiences that shine on me and make me satisfied and make me feel warm and content and all that.

535
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:48,721
The more of these new suns, the better.

536
00:47:52,801 --> 00:47:56,161
So I'm going to say again, whether I'm finishing it, but I want to sum up.

537
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:00,480
The really interesting thing is, I think that meaning is by definition stable.

538
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,881
Once you have it, you want to keep it.

539
00:48:02,881 --> 00:48:09,761
Remember, he says, once you're a meaning addict, you'd rather suffer than give it up and find yourself in a meaningless world.

540
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:20,241
And I think wonder is by principle unstable because if it's exciting, then you could get bored and you would move on and outgrow it.

541
00:48:20,241 --> 00:48:28,800
And Nietzsche definitely thinks that he wants to substitute wonder for meaning as what people really need to bring out.

542
00:48:28,801 --> 00:48:30,721
And why do they really need it?

543
00:48:30,721 --> 00:48:36,960
Because outgrowing is what everybody really needs, because that's what it is to be alive.

544
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:43,361
And meaning doesn't permit outgrowing, but wonder sort of requires outgrowing.

545
00:48:49,921 --> 00:49:12,841
And once you realize in Nietzsche language that you posit the values that you've got, that is, there's no values in the universe, you make them up, and you can change the values, that they aren't grounded in sort of the Supreme Being or any metaphysical principles, then you, wow, this is wrong.

546
00:49:16,681 --> 00:49:18,440
Oh no, I'm just reading it wrong.

547
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:40,041
So if no Supreme Being or metaphysics gives what you're doing a grounding, gives it stability and gives it meaning, then it becomes a source of power and excitement to you that there are no values sort of fixed in the universe, and you're free to change them, to make up new values.

548
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:43,801
That's one of the, that's the highest thing people can do.

549
00:49:43,881 --> 00:49:45,320
I'm going to get to it in a minute.

550
00:49:45,321 --> 00:49:50,040
That's going to be what differentiates us from animal, from a lower immediacy.

551
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,120
But let me get there bit by bit.

552
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,881
I'm on a new point now.

553
00:49:53,881 --> 00:49:56,440
I've been talking about brief habits all this time.

554
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:01,960
I hope it hasn't been too boring for those who were there, and it's important, you can see, for those who weren't.

555
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,720
Anyway, onto new horizons.

556
00:50:03,721 --> 00:50:07,721
That's what he calls the, that's what I call the next thing I want to talk about.

557
00:50:07,721 --> 00:50:14,360
So the exciting thing is, and the important thing is, that you can always open up new worlds.

558
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:21,160
And that's, he talks about that at the top of 232, right where we are, at the end of 289.

559
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:29,240
There is yet another world to be discovered and more than one embark philosophers, that is, free spirits.

560
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:35,561
So, and that's be, and therefore, you can always go beyond the horizon.

561
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:40,361
The horizon is free, says, I think, on 242, let's hope.

562
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,440
No, it's right after the death of God.

563
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,480
I didn't think that looked right.

564
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,520
Where they're new, oh, where the horizon is open again.

565
00:50:46,761 --> 00:50:52,240
Help me find.

566
00:50:52,801 --> 00:50:55,681
There we are, on 180.

567
00:50:56,401 --> 00:50:58,000
In the horizon of the infinite.

568
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,241
We've left behind the land, we burned our bridges behind us, and so forth.

569
00:51:02,241 --> 00:51:06,080
And there's no more land, it says at the top of 184.

570
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:24,721
That's a way of saying that we go from a closed world, the monotheistic world, though not only the medieval world, but even the modern world thinks that it's got, in the case of the medieval world, the supreme being makes it a closed world.

571
00:51:24,721 --> 00:51:28,721
God created it, and the rules are in it, and it's eternal.

572
00:51:28,881 --> 00:51:38,881
For the modern, not the free spirit modern, but the modern people after Descartes, it's reason that gives all the fixed order to the world, that it's just as fixed.

573
00:51:39,361 --> 00:51:43,040
And the new world is open.

574
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,120
It hasn't got any horizon.

575
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,320
It limits it.

576
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,801
I think, how many saw the Truman show?

577
00:51:48,801 --> 00:51:57,680
The Truman Show is so great, the scene in which he actually discovers he's in a closed world, remember, and bumps up against the edge of it.

578
00:51:57,681 --> 00:52:00,401
That's one of the amazing scenes in movies.

579
00:52:00,401 --> 00:52:02,321
That movie isn't appreciated enough.

580
00:52:02,321 --> 00:52:04,081
And then, remember, what happens?

581
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,201
The voice comes on and says, I'm your creator.

582
00:52:07,201 --> 00:52:14,160
And that's the guy who designed the Truman show and says, don't go, don't open that door.

583
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,040
I mean, it turns out there's a door in this wall in the closed world.

584
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:17,921
Don't go out there.

585
00:52:17,921 --> 00:52:19,041
It's risky.

586
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,241
Stay in here.

587
00:52:20,241 --> 00:52:21,520
Everything is settled.

588
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,480
You'll be safe.

589
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,001
I'll take care of you.

590
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,320
And Truman goes out.

591
00:52:26,321 --> 00:52:27,841
That's a Nietzschean move.

592
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:40,921
He leaves behind the closed world and he goes out into a world in which, to talk like Nietzsche, there will be new suns, new worlds, new perspectives, new gods, new everythings.

593
00:52:40,921 --> 00:52:43,641
I'm going to talk about all the new everythings for a while.

594
00:52:45,401 --> 00:52:49,561
I wrote here joyful, but I wonder if I really have a right to say that.

595
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:52,200
I think, I don't think the quote says joyful.

596
00:52:52,201 --> 00:52:53,001
We'll look.

597
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,400
But I'm going to circle.

598
00:52:55,401 --> 00:52:58,440
I didn't have this anti-joyful.

599
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:02,841
So let's look on 242.

600
00:53:05,401 --> 00:53:18,601
He's talking about this new, wonderful thing you get when you finally accept the death of God, the end of monotony theism, the end of the closed world.

601
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:23,801
And then about five lines down, a strong, bold, audacious, to enjoy.

602
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,000
That's nice.

603
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,361
Enjoy is okay.

604
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:33,401
To enjoy a strong, bold, audacious soul, to go through life with a calm eye and firm step, always prepared to risk all.

605
00:53:33,881 --> 00:53:42,121
That's like Michel Coitard, festively impelled by the longing for undiscovered worlds and seas, people, and gods.

606
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:49,561
Skipping down a bit, the most profound enjoyment of the moment and so forth.

607
00:53:49,881 --> 00:53:51,801
And that was the happiness of Homer.

608
00:53:52,841 --> 00:54:02,201
I mean, with you, back to the Homeric Greeks to get his, you can't just invent out of whole cloth, I think, a new set of values.

609
00:54:02,201 --> 00:54:10,521
What you have to do is take something that's already in your tradition, that was marginal now, and make it central.

610
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,480
And then you transform the world.

611
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,760
And that's what he's doing.

612
00:54:15,401 --> 00:54:20,641
He's trying, he's the ultimate sort of outgrower.

613
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:29,361
He's not only going to change all our specific values, like that untruth is as important as truth, and evil is as important as good.

614
00:54:29,361 --> 00:54:32,480
I'll talk about that later, and so forth.

615
00:54:33,281 --> 00:54:37,520
He says he's going to do what he calls the transvaluation of all values.

616
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,161
That's the subtitle of the world, power.

617
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:45,601
But that doesn't mean just that all particular values, he's going to try to turn them over.

618
00:54:45,921 --> 00:54:50,641
That means he's going to sort of transform the very notion of values.

619
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,001
Because before, values were fixed.

620
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,881
And now, for Nietzsche, values are posited by us.

621
00:54:58,881 --> 00:55:01,201
And we can change them.

622
00:55:01,201 --> 00:55:07,040
And the most important high-level value is the value of life.

623
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:12,641
It's the value of constantly outgrowing, which is no particular value.

624
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,760
So he's done two things.

625
00:55:13,761 --> 00:55:19,681
He sort of switched around a lot of particular values, but in the end, he switched around something much more important.

626
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:28,080
He's found a value sort of higher than all of the ones that we normally have.

627
00:55:28,401 --> 00:55:35,521
And that's, I don't know why I'm saying that now, but sometime one has to say that, so I said it now.

628
00:55:35,761 --> 00:55:48,561
So this is world creating, and wonder is now what you experience when you are able to invent new values.

629
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,401
Okay, let's see.

630
00:55:50,721 --> 00:55:53,841
And the religion that goes with wonder is polytheism.

631
00:55:53,841 --> 00:55:56,960
He talks about that on 191.

632
00:55:58,241 --> 00:56:00,001
You can imagine why.

633
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,560
It's the anti-monotheism.

634
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:05,081
On 191, aphorism 143.

635
00:56:05,401 --> 00:56:12,521
For an individual to posit his own ideals, see, that means you invent your own values.

636
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:21,721
To derive from it his own law, joys, and rights, that may well have been considered hitherto outrageous aberration, idolatry.

637
00:56:21,721 --> 00:56:30,121
The few who dared as much always felt the need to apologize to themselves, usually saying it wasn't I, not I, but a god.

638
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:35,321
The wonderful art and gift of creating gods, that's polytheism, he says.

639
00:56:35,321 --> 00:56:41,720
And what he's against, about eight lines from the bottom, there was only one norm, man.

640
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:44,680
That is, there was whatever it was to be a human being.

641
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:49,881
Different epochs had a norm, but it could be to be a rational animal.

642
00:56:49,881 --> 00:56:52,121
It could be to be a creature of God.

643
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:56,121
Now I think it's to get the most out of your possibilities.

644
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:59,720
But there's always some view about what it is to be a human being.

645
00:56:59,721 --> 00:57:06,440
And sort of we knew that somebody, when you discover it, you think, well, that's what we really knew all along, or should have.

646
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:13,160
So, but above and outside, in some distant overworld, one was permitted to behold a plurality of norms.

647
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:18,280
One God was not considered a denial of another God, nor blasphemy against him.

648
00:57:18,281 --> 00:57:19,480
See, that's important.

649
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:23,480
The gods are different perspectives in Homeric Greece for Nietzsche.

650
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:33,320
There's the erotic perspective, and that's Aphrodite, and there's the warlike perspective, and that's Aries, and there's the domestic perspective, and that's Terra.

651
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:40,440
There's the sort of ethnological nerve perspective, and that's Hephaestus.

652
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,881
And they've all, they're just fine, all of them.

653
00:57:43,881 --> 00:57:46,120
And they don't contradict each other.

654
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,320
In fact, they sort of complement each other.

655
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:52,720
The techie makes jewelry for Aphrodite and so forth.

656
00:57:53,040 --> 00:58:02,241
But the picture is that for him, mainly that God doesn't, there doesn't have to be one God and one way of looking at things.

657
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:18,400
There are, at the top of 192, undermen, dwarfs, fairies, centaurs, sagers, demons, and devils with the inestimable preliminary exercise for the justification of egoism and the sovereignty of the individual.

658
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:25,361
See, it ends up with egoism because everybody can invent a God that justifies whatever they do.

659
00:58:25,361 --> 00:58:28,080
And finally, they just don't need any gods anymore.

660
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,240
At the bottom there of that.

661
00:58:30,241 --> 00:58:39,200
In polytheism, the free-spiriting and many-spiriting of man attained its first preliminary form, the strength to create for ourselves our own new eyes.

662
00:58:39,201 --> 00:58:42,881
See, we've had new worlds, new suns, added to the list, new eyes.

663
00:58:43,841 --> 00:58:46,081
Keep your eyes open for all the new things.

664
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:51,841
And ever again, new eyes, and even more, ever, that are even more our own.

665
00:58:51,841 --> 00:58:57,041
Hence, man alone among all animals has no eternal horizons and perspectives.

666
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,721
That's interesting.

667
00:58:58,721 --> 00:59:08,881
What does it mean to say that here, Kierkegaard says, this is so interesting and funny, that the lower immediacy is like animals, like butterflies and caterpillars.

668
00:59:08,881 --> 00:59:10,881
They have no eternity.

669
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:13,201
They are changing all the time.

670
00:59:13,201 --> 00:59:16,000
Nietzsche says, no animals have eternity.

671
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,600
They're stuck in their species.

672
00:59:17,801 --> 00:59:22,721
All the butterflies, all the caterpillars turn exactly into all the same kinds of butterflies.

673
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:30,641
The interesting thing about nature is that it's that all the species go on doing their thing forever.

674
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:34,841
But we don't have any nature, that is, human beings.

675
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:37,321
They can give themselves new natures.

676
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:49,000
They can, as I say, give themselves the nature creature of God, or give themselves the nature of potential hero, or give themselves the nature rational animal, and so forth.

677
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,681
But they aren't animals.

678
00:59:52,761 --> 00:59:55,480
They are flexible.

679
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:56,921
So it's just the opposite.

680
00:59:56,921 --> 01:00:04,120
For Kierkegaard, change is the animal thing, and eternity is the good thing.

681
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:10,841
You want to get, you have to have eternity in Kierkegaard's unconditional commitment to get eternity.

682
01:00:10,841 --> 01:00:19,801
For Nietzsche, eternal is his, or forever, is the lower thing where you're stuck.

683
01:00:19,801 --> 01:00:27,401
And change, constant overcoming, brief habits and so forth, is the human thing.

684
01:00:27,401 --> 01:00:32,281
And the ultimate change is that we can change our very nature and our world.

685
01:00:32,281 --> 01:00:34,361
So that's what he's talking about.

686
01:00:34,681 --> 01:00:35,240
Where?

687
01:00:35,881 --> 01:00:36,361
The animal.

688
01:00:36,361 --> 01:00:36,921
Where does he say?

689
01:00:37,321 --> 01:00:42,121
Man alone among all the animals has no eternal horizons and perspectives.

690
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,881
You see what that means?

691
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,720
That's very existential.

692
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:52,601
It starts with Pascal, who says custom is our nature, which means we don't have any nature.

693
01:00:54,201 --> 01:00:58,520
It ends with Sartre saying that our essence is our existence.

694
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:01,720
I mean, but Nietzsche's saying it in his own way.

695
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:11,881
We invent, we are the only beings who invent what it is to be our kind of, the kind of being we are.

696
01:01:11,881 --> 01:01:15,001
So, and animals can't do it.

697
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:18,080
Man is the undetermined animal.

698
01:01:16,841 --> 01:01:19,600
It has no nature.

699
01:01:22,401 --> 01:01:25,200
And so we get new everything on 232.

700
01:01:25,201 --> 01:01:28,241
There's a whole bunch of new stuff.

701
01:01:30,801 --> 01:01:31,680
Where is that?

702
01:01:31,681 --> 01:01:33,121
232?

703
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,881
I don't see it.

704
01:01:35,201 --> 01:01:37,040
Oh, yes, well, I read it already.

705
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,841
There's more than one world to be discovered.

706
01:01:40,721 --> 01:01:42,881
Okay, how about 265?

707
01:01:43,201 --> 01:01:49,761
The game of looking for new stuff is endless in this book, but I'm going to just give you some.

708
01:01:50,401 --> 01:01:53,601
So here we go at the bottom of 265.

709
01:01:53,921 --> 01:01:59,041
Let us, this is aphorism 335.

710
01:01:59,361 --> 01:02:07,361
Let us therefore limit ourselves to the purification of our opinions and valuations, to the creation of our own new table of what is good.

711
01:02:07,361 --> 01:02:10,881
That means that's the table of values.

712
01:02:10,881 --> 01:02:13,361
That is, we decide what's good.

713
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,681
And then the end is very niche and about eight lines down.

714
01:02:17,681 --> 01:02:29,440
We want to become those we are, human beings who are new, unique, incomparable, who give themselves laws, who create themselves.

715
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:32,480
That's the whole, that's the same idea.

716
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,401
It keeps coming back and back.

717
01:02:50,881 --> 01:02:51,761
And now, where are we?

718
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,121
So 265, 266.

719
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,520
Okay, I've made a list here that I know of.

720
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:05,561
New perspective, new suns, new worlds, new eyes, new gods, new selves.

721
01:03:05,881 --> 01:03:10,281
For Nietzsche, the highest value is being able to establish new values.

722
01:03:10,281 --> 01:03:15,241
He says that in The Antichrist, on the very end, 199.

723
01:03:15,241 --> 01:03:18,120
How many of you have got your Antichrist book with you?

724
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,760
Not the gay science, but the other one.

725
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:26,841
I want to tell you now something I forgot to tell you at the beginning, but first let's just find it.

726
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:30,520
Remember, I talked about the revaluation of all values.

727
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:33,801
That's on the very last line of the Antichrist.

728
01:03:33,801 --> 01:03:37,401
It's also in The Will of Power, but here you've got it right in front of you.

729
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,200
That's the highest thing.

730
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:44,361
Twilight 54, I wonder what that is.

731
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:57,401
That's not what I want to talk about.

732
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,720
Well, maybe I turned two pages.

733
01:04:03,721 --> 01:04:06,281
It looks to me like I've gotten where I don't want to be.

734
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:07,801
Establish.

735
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,881
Okay, now I see where we are.

736
01:04:09,881 --> 01:04:11,000
So how are we doing?

737
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,521
Okay, to change.

738
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:17,960
That's the end of that story.

739
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:24,681
I mean, the end of the story about what the highest thing we can do is create new whatevers.

740
01:04:24,681 --> 01:04:30,521
And that's brief habits is the sort of minimal version of that.

741
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:40,281
And changing the world completely, which is what Nietzsche's trying to do, would be the ultimate thing, the most powerful, the most joyful.

742
01:04:40,281 --> 01:04:42,921
I don't know whether joy and joyful are all that different.

743
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:44,361
I am worried about it.

744
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:47,841
But don't worry, nothing big deal hinges on it.

745
01:04:48,721 --> 01:04:55,760
If we needed to, we'd use bliss for the Christian one and cheerfulness for Nietzsche, but they may get confused.

746
01:04:55,761 --> 01:04:58,480
Okay, we have a whole new thing to do yet.

747
01:04:58,801 --> 01:05:02,721
So try to, you're all looking alert, so that's good.

748
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:08,161
There's a whole story in here, too, which is just a different story now.

749
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:20,400
Another way Nietzsche wants to be anti-Christian, anti-Dostoevsky, anti-Kierkegaard, anti-modern and enlightenment, all of them.

750
01:05:20,401 --> 01:05:27,361
He wants to say that somehow incorporating evil in your life is a necessary and good thing.

751
01:05:27,361 --> 01:05:29,440
Now, oh, but I didn't say what I meant to say.

752
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,760
I want to say, bring this next time for sure.

753
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:37,600
Because next time, I want to start comparing Nietzsche and Dostoevsky and Kierkegaard.

754
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:50,160
And in here, particularly in the part about, which you should read, and it's assigned, about Nietzsche's view of Christianity and of Jesus is the clue to how to put them together.

755
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,680
But I'm not going to do that now.

756
01:05:51,681 --> 01:06:10,080
What I want to talk about now is this evil business, which goes back to Orson Welles and the Third Man about how the Borges produced Michelangelo and the Swiss with their democracy and peace produced the cuckoo clock.

757
01:06:10,401 --> 01:06:21,360
On 79, he says, What preserves the species, the strongest and most evil spirits, have so far done the most to advance humanity.

758
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:23,841
That's what Orson Welles is explaining.

759
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:28,960
And then I want to read more of it.

760
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:36,761
Again and again, they re-loomed, re-illuminated, that is, re-light ignited the passions that were going to sleep.

761
01:06:31,841 --> 01:06:38,841
It's in a way related to the brief habits.

762
01:06:38,921 --> 01:06:46,600
People were getting bored, people were getting complacent and sort of satisfied in their, what they were with what they were doing.

763
01:06:46,601 --> 01:06:53,000
And these people, the evil people, woke them up.

764
01:06:53,000 --> 01:07:03,640
So about 15 lines down, in every teacher and preacher of what is new, we encounter the same wickedness that makes conquerors notorious, even if its expression is subtler.

765
01:07:03,641 --> 01:07:13,960
What he's saying is if you open up a new world, it's bound to look evil because it goes against the values of the previous world.

766
01:07:14,601 --> 01:07:25,000
So modernity looked evil to the medievals, and Nietzsche looks outrageous to the moderns.

767
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:34,120
And so in every teacher and preacher, what is new, what is new, see, this is what ties what I said to, I mean, I've been giving you a whole story about new.

768
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:42,200
Now I'm going to tell you what it looks like for having new eyes, new perspectives, new world, new sons, and so forth.

769
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:43,560
Well, it looks evil.

770
01:07:43,881 --> 01:07:56,120
In every teacher and preacher of what is new, we encounter the same wickedness that makes conquerors notorious, even its expression is subtler and does not immediately set the muscles in motion, therefore does not make one that notorious.

771
01:07:56,120 --> 01:08:07,080
What is new, however, this is the crucial line, is always evil, being that which wants to conquer and overthrow the old boundary markers and the old pieties.

772
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,640
And only what is old is good.

773
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,560
The people who are in it, they think that's the right way to do things.

774
01:08:13,561 --> 01:08:20,000
The conservative people, with the new people, are overthrowing them, are evil, like Michelle Poitard.

775
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,360
He's overthrowing everything.

776
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:23,360
I mean, and he looks pretty evil, all right.

777
01:08:16,761 --> 01:08:23,681
It's hard.

778
01:08:23,921 --> 01:08:34,960
You have to have a sort of, you have to be really sort of inside the overthrowing to see it okay to treat his girlfriend the way he does at the beginning of the movie.

779
01:08:35,761 --> 01:08:39,120
The nice girl who wants to loan him money, so he steals it.

780
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:59,440
But she hasn't understood that she hasn't pursued the question why until it becomes, until he sees that there's no, that the why receives no answer, so she needs to be just taken, she can be just taken advantage of because he's seen a whole different way of acting.

781
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:06,160
The good men are in all ages those who dig the old thoughts, digging deep and getting them to bear fruit.

782
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:09,440
Deep is always a bad thing, like serious for Nietzsche.

783
01:09:09,441 --> 01:09:15,520
The farmers of the spirit, but eventually all land is exploited and the plowshare of evil must come again and again.

784
01:09:15,521 --> 01:09:17,680
Recognize brief habits again.

785
01:09:17,681 --> 01:09:36,240
Eventually, whatever these farmers of the good come up with as new values finally get boring and people and conventional don't give life any excitement anymore and you have to find something new.

786
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:48,720
So and how does such a life look, a kind of life that lives inside of grief habits and is evil?

787
01:09:48,721 --> 01:09:51,560
Well, he talks about it on 331.

788
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:03,240
On 331, the aphorism 371, we incomprehensible ones.

789
01:10:03,561 --> 01:10:10,520
By the way, I may read from things I haven't assigned, and if I do, think of them as added to the assignment.

790
01:10:10,521 --> 01:10:18,200
What happens is I keep changing my mind and finding things, and I'm not always sure what I've assigned, and I don't take time to go back and look.

791
01:10:18,521 --> 01:10:21,560
Okay, so here we are on 371.

792
01:10:21,881 --> 01:10:29,480
Have we ever complained because we are misunderstood, misjudged, misidentified, slandered, misheard, or not heard?

793
01:10:29,481 --> 01:10:31,160
Precisely, this is our fate.

794
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,080
Nietzsche is talking directly to you.

795
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,440
Oh, for a long time yet.

796
01:10:34,441 --> 01:10:37,480
Let us say to be modest until 1901.

797
01:10:37,481 --> 01:10:41,640
That is, he thought that maybe people would begin to understand him in 30 years.

798
01:10:41,641 --> 01:10:42,761
That was pretty accurate.

799
01:10:42,761 --> 01:10:49,960
They started to translate him and to take him to French and English should take him very seriously about then, I think.

800
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:52,440
It is also our distinction.

801
01:10:52,441 --> 01:10:56,120
We should not honor ourselves sufficiently if we wish that it were otherwise.

802
01:10:56,120 --> 01:11:01,881
We are misidentified because we ourselves keep growing, keep changing.

803
01:11:01,881 --> 01:11:03,400
We shed our old bark.

804
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,240
We shed our skins every spring.

805
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:09,240
We keep becoming younger, fuller of the future, taller, stronger.

806
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:12,921
We push our roots ever more powerfully into the depths.

807
01:11:12,921 --> 01:11:15,881
Well, here, depths is okay.

808
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:20,200
When deep means meaningful and seriousness, Nietzsche is against it.

809
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:23,320
When deep means evil, he's for it.

810
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:26,761
So we push our powerfully into the depths into evil.

811
01:11:26,761 --> 01:11:27,560
What would that be?

812
01:11:27,561 --> 01:11:34,440
That would be our most primitive, perhaps, and destructive impulses.

813
01:11:34,921 --> 01:11:36,440
I'm going to talk a lot about that.

814
01:11:36,441 --> 01:11:49,841
How are you supposed to deal with the Karamatsov side of your personality when the Karamatsov side meant the insect, the lackey, the bad, the sensuous, the selfish?

815
01:11:49,841 --> 01:11:55,120
I mean, Nietzsche wants to talk about how you should deal with this evil.

816
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,040
And I'm going to get there next time more.

817
01:11:57,761 --> 01:12:02,160
But remember, Dostoevsky thought you should sublimate it.

818
01:12:02,721 --> 01:12:04,640
Face it, and it would go away.

819
01:12:04,641 --> 01:12:06,320
Nietzsche doesn't want it to go away.

820
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:14,480
He says we get, we push our roots into the evil, we embrace the heaven more lovingly, more broadly, and so forth.

821
01:12:14,481 --> 01:12:16,640
Now, like trees, we grow.

822
01:12:16,641 --> 01:12:20,320
And that is, in all directions and so forth.

823
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,360
Outward, inward.

824
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:24,720
Our energy is at work simultaneously in the trunk and branches.

825
01:12:24,721 --> 01:12:28,881
We no longer feel free to do one particular thing to be only one thing.

826
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:36,000
I mean, this is setting up what I'm going to give you the basic clue for in a minute.

827
01:12:38,801 --> 01:12:44,000
What I'm trying to do is not do the twilight and the antichrist till you bring them next.

828
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,960
How many have twilight and antichrist wisdom like that?

829
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:47,681
Lots of you.

830
01:12:47,681 --> 01:12:49,040
Well, I could go on.

831
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,000
Let's see.

832
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:55,600
But on the other hand, I think it's better if I let me just see where I want to be.

833
01:13:01,681 --> 01:13:03,761
What bothers me is I had a great quote.

834
01:13:03,761 --> 01:13:05,280
Maybe it was that quote about evil.

835
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,680
Maybe that's the quote I already said.

836
01:13:07,681 --> 01:13:10,160
Yeah, I think, anybody want to say anything?

837
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:16,480
I've been talking and talking, partly because I wanted to cram in a whole other lecture before into this one.

838
01:13:16,481 --> 01:13:22,721
Let's, let me, I mean, if you can stand it, let's stay the last five minutes so I can hear some response from this.

839
01:13:22,721 --> 01:13:25,680
I'm sorry, I talked so long without anybody thinking.

840
01:13:27,601 --> 01:13:28,560
You're all done?

841
01:13:28,561 --> 01:13:29,120
Yeah.

842
01:13:40,521 --> 01:13:42,921
Yes, that's a puzzling thing.

843
01:14:03,801 --> 01:14:04,440
Yeah?

844
01:14:14,601 --> 01:14:15,721
No, no, no.

845
01:14:15,721 --> 01:14:18,120
I mean, you might think that, but that's not so.

846
01:14:18,841 --> 01:14:28,200
He thinks that he talks about the somewhere free spirits who dance on near abysses on unsubstantial ropes and so forth.

847
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:41,000
I think he thinks that you could be, I'm not sure, a free spirit constantly finding new wonders, constantly changing.

848
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:46,280
But I think that I'm agreeing with you that he thinks that that's as bad as being stuck.

849
01:14:46,761 --> 01:14:50,761
He's trying to say the word, and that's why brief habits is so interesting.

850
01:14:50,761 --> 01:15:01,720
You should sort of get, it's like you should sort of get rooted in something or get something stable so that you can use it to climb out into something else.

851
01:15:01,721 --> 01:15:03,480
You can't really outgrow.

852
01:15:03,481 --> 01:15:05,881
And I sort of said this already, and it's sort of what you said.

853
01:15:05,881 --> 01:15:09,480
I mean, I don't think she represents the enemy.

854
01:15:09,481 --> 01:15:13,080
I think the enemy is really something very post-modern.

855
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:20,160
Some people who think that they should sort of every day have a new way of looking at the world, that there is any such thing.

856
01:15:16,681 --> 01:15:21,360
I think he's not for that.

857
01:15:21,601 --> 01:15:25,680
Maybe there aren't any such people who want to be completely flexible.

858
01:15:25,681 --> 01:15:34,560
But he doesn't want it, because as I said, and I say it again, you can't be outgrowing something unless you grow into it for a while.

859
01:15:34,561 --> 01:15:51,600
So his idea is you take on something, you really live it to the full, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it, and then when it's no longer satisfying, you outgrow it.

860
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,200
That's the best thing.

861
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:54,960
That's what free spirits do.

862
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:55,440
Yeah.

863
01:15:55,441 --> 01:15:58,560
I mean, that's like a review of where we were, which is a good place to stop.

864
01:15:58,561 --> 01:16:01,040
So let's stop at that.

865
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:12,801
Hi.

866
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,160
Oh, wait a minute.
