1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,519
Now, here we go.

2
00:00:01,519 --> 00:00:07,159
This time, we've got something else to read and think about.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:13,080
And I intend to do Yvonne's rebellion.

4
00:00:13,399 --> 00:00:17,560
It's just about what you can cover in one lecture.

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:23,560
And it's very interesting and very important and existentialist.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:30,759
It reveals a lot about Dostoevsky's philosophy and a lot about Yvonne all at the same time.

7
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:57,959
Just to remember where we are, Yvonne is the one who wants to be perfect, to get rid of the base, earthy, dark, sensual, Karamatsov side of himself and become a refined, abstract, pure person who is self-sufficient and observer, not involved, observer, eyewitness of what's going on.

8
00:00:58,279 --> 00:01:04,120
It comes out, too, in lots of little ways, how he doesn't want to get involved with anybody.

9
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:15,559
On 223, he's starting to tell Alyasha his intimate life sort of stance.

10
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:23,399
And he tells him something which only Yvonne would think at the top of 223.

11
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:27,720
He says, I want to get to know you once and for all, and I want you to know me.

12
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,320
And then we will say goodbye.

13
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,079
I believe it's always best to get to know people just before leaving them.

14
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:52,720
That is, not to get involved, not to get hurt, not to get, that is, you may know people like that who just at the end of vacation or just at the end of the school year, or you will be able to get close to them only because they know that they're going to go away and everything, and not, and so are in some sense safe.

15
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,679
So Ivan wants to tell Alyasha everything as long as they don't get involved.

16
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,600
And he wants to tell him this sort of existentialist thing.

17
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:13,360
He wants to tell him the middle of 228, I'm trying to explain as quickly as possible my essential nature.

18
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:18,560
That is what manner of man I am, what I believe in, and for what I hope.

19
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,919
That's it, isn't it?

20
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:31,120
And he wants to give Alyasha his existentialist stance, which he succeeds very well in doing in the course of the following discussion.

21
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,839
And it's not taught, it isn't really even telling him what he believes.

22
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:37,440
It's something deeper than that.

23
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:44,159
It's telling him how he relates to the world, how he lives, that he wants to explain.

24
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:53,279
And he says that, he starts to explain that on page 223.

25
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:59,200
And this long speech I have to read because it's complicated what Yvonne's relation is.

26
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,720
It isn't just that he's an observer.

27
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,799
It's, well, you'll see when I read it, a little below the middle of 223.

28
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:32,560
Do you know, I've been sitting here thinking to myself that if I didn't believe in life, if I lost faith in the woman I love, that's Katerina, lost faith in the order of things, or convinced, in fact, that everything is a disorderly, damnable, and perhaps devil-ridden chaos, which in a way he does believe, if I were struck by every horror of man's disillusionment, still I would want to live.

29
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:40,040
That is, he's enough involved in life that he can't just get out of it.

30
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:45,880
But having once tasted of the cup, I would not turn away from it.

31
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,719
The cup is the cup of life.

32
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,560
He's talking all these metaphors.

33
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,360
I would not turn away from it till I had drained it.

34
00:03:52,360 --> 00:04:01,800
That is, he wants to get everything he can out of life before he turns away from it, and he means to commit suicide, it turns out, at 30.

35
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:09,399
At 30, though, I shall be sure to leave the cup, even if I've not emptied it, and turn away where I do not know.

36
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:16,279
Although he certainly sort of knows that he's got to, and he wants to kill himself.

37
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:23,159
But till I'm 30, I know that my youth will triumph over everything, every disillusionment, every disgust with life.

38
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:30,120
I've asked myself many times whether there is in the world any despair that could overcome this frantic thirst for life.

39
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,480
See, that's the Karamatsov in him he can't get rid of.

40
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:37,079
And I've come to the conclusion that there isn't, that is till I'm 30.

41
00:04:37,399 --> 00:05:01,480
And then he thinks he will, because this Karamatsov sensuality and search for life and love of, as he says at the top of 224, the sticky little leaves in the spring and so forth, the blue sky, all this attractive side of the world that attracts Yvonne and makes him attractive.

42
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,320
He can't get over it, but he wants to.

43
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,680
And when he does, at 30, then he'll get out of the world somehow.

44
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,360
And so, and he seems to love people.

45
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,639
It's sort of hard to get a fix on that.

46
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:23,280
He seems to be loving Katerina.

47
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:29,680
And when he's talking to her, it looks like he has this sensual, earthy side.

48
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:34,399
But he also says at one point he's never understood loving his neighbors.

49
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,440
And Fedor says that Ivan never loved anyone.

50
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,120
I think that's sort of true.

51
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,440
And he certainly has no unconditioned commitment to anyone but himself.

52
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:52,719
Because if he found himself really getting involved with someone, so that they were the important thing in his life, gave his life meaning, he would be in terrible shape.

53
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,040
He wants to be autonomous.

54
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,400
He wants to be a self-made and independent person.

55
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:06,880
So I think he loves people as much as you can love people and still be a completely safe, independent person.

56
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,639
And that's so much for that.

57
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:24,799
He considers then, in a funny way, his involvement in the world, his sensual side, his Karamatsov life, as not essential and somehow bad.

58
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,320
And it's not essential because he can get rid of it.

59
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:38,719
He may have to kill himself to get rid of it, but he's not going to let it determine what he does, at least not after as soon as he can get free of it at 30.

60
00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:42,080
Now that's not altogether crucial.

61
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,800
What's crucial is what follows.

62
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:56,079
That is, what he explains to Alyasha is his basic stance on the world, why he has to get out of it when he's 30.

63
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:11,000
And why that given his sort of honorable, moral, pure attitude, it's just impossible for him to stay around in this world.

64
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:28,440
And that's, and first, before I can explain that, and he can, before he can explain that to Alyasha, he's got to make a distinction, which is a very existentialist Pascalian distinction.

65
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,040
He's not going to discuss whether God exists or not.

66
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:42,280
He says we're just not capable with our finite, everyday human minds to grasp whether God exists or not.

67
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,080
Pascal starts this like so many other important existentialist things.

68
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:51,000
Pascal has this wonderful idea in the PensÃ©es.

69
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:54,360
He doesn't say you can't prove the existence of God.

70
00:07:54,359 --> 00:08:04,440
He says you can prove the existence of God and you can prove the non-existence of God, which is just a very interesting and true philosophical thing to say.

71
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:11,000
Philosophers have come up with all sorts of interesting proofs of the existence of God and all sorts of interesting proofs of the non-existence.

72
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,920
And what Pascal thinks is that just shows the limits of human reason.

73
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,839
And that's exactly what Yvonne thinks.

74
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:27,399
He says, at the bottom 228, about a third of the page up, I have a Euclidean earthly mind, and so how can I solve problems which are not of the world?

75
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,280
And I advise you never to think about it either, Alyasha, especially about God, whether he exists or not.

76
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,199
And Alyasha never does.

77
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,600
All such questions are utterly inappropriate for a mind created with an idea of only three dimensions.

78
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,119
And so I accept God.

79
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:43,880
He doesn't really care.

80
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:49,639
I mean, that's just, for the sake of the argument, in effect, for the sake of the argument, I accept God.

81
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,520
I'm glad to.

82
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,199
And what's more, I accept his wisdom, his purpose, which is completely beyond our knowledge.

83
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:58,160
But he's going to make a different sort of argument, he says.

84
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,000
And that's the argument that he's about to give Gabrielle.

85
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,120
Gabrielle's the name of my daughter.

86
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:08,159
I don't know how she got into this, into my head today.

87
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,760
I haven't even talked to her on the phone or anything for a few days.

88
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,199
But anyway, if I keep saying Gabrielle, I always mean Yvonne.

89
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:17,280
What the connection is, is beyond me.

90
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:32,560
Now we have to go into his argument, which is his defense of a certain philosophical position, but not just a philosophical position, but a certain way of life that he wants to defend.

91
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,480
And that's what he starts talking about on 229 at the top.

92
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,280
Yet, would you believe it in the final result?

93
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,799
I don't accept this world of God's, although I know it exists.

94
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,160
I don't accept it at all.

95
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,479
It's not that I don't accept God, you must understand.

96
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:52,320
It's the world created by Him I don't and cannot accept.

97
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,440
And that's very, I mean, that's a kind of existentialist point.

98
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,399
It doesn't really matter whether the Supreme Being exists.

99
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:05,360
Remember, Kierkegaard got rid of the Supreme Being already, and he was a, and yet he thought faith was very important.

100
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:15,440
It's a question of faith is about how you live in the world and how involved you will be in the world and in what way you will be involved in the world.

101
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:26,240
And Yvonne has a very strong view that he does not accept the usual Christian way of being in the world.

102
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,680
That's what he rejects.

103
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:34,400
And now we're going to find out what he means.

104
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:49,480
He's going to prove that any decent person is obliged to leave the world as soon as possible, as soon as they get over this young, sensual love of everything, which he sort of has.

105
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:53,880
And the question is for Ivan, why should you do that?

106
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:55,719
Well, he's going to tell us why.

107
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,760
And he has a rather complicated argument, not terribly.

108
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:13,240
And he's going to tell us, you know, he's going to argue, he's going to give evidence that the world is such a corrupt and evil place that no moral person could accept living in it.

109
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,839
That's his rebellion.

110
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,320
That's his rejection of the world.

111
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:28,280
And you should be asking yourself, because Dostoevsky wants you to take this book seriously and to take the arguments in the book seriously.

112
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:35,240
You have to ask yourself, as you hear this argument right now, and as you read it, are you convinced?

113
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:37,959
Are you going to commit suicide at the age of 30?

114
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:41,079
And if not, where's the flaw in his argument?

115
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:43,160
It's pretty convincing.

116
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,280
It even convinces Alyasha, as you'll see.

117
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,600
And that's very interesting.

118
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:51,480
Okay, and so here we go.

119
00:11:51,479 --> 00:12:00,119
He says he's been collecting a dossier of child abuse, in effect, atrocities committed against children.

120
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:07,160
And he's got, and that's going to be the sort of basis of his case against the world.

121
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:13,400
On 232, at the middle of the page, roughly, he says, I like to collect certain facts.

122
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,680
And would you believe?

123
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,600
I even copy anecdotes of a certain sort from newspapers and books.

124
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:20,760
I've got a fine collection.

125
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,480
I think fine is not quite the right translation, though.

126
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:25,600
I can't explain why.

127
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:26,720
But you just take my word for it.

128
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,840
He should be saying, I've got a nice collection.

129
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:38,480
Now, why, what the difference is between a fine and a nice is so all right, but you'll see that it fits.

130
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:41,760
And next time he talks about this, he does say nice.

131
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,840
Fine makes it sound too much like it's fine art.

132
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,480
That's not what he's got.

133
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,120
So let's go on.

134
00:12:53,359 --> 00:13:00,960
And first, he has to get rid of two objections to his argument: that there is all this evil because everybody deserves it.

135
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,680
They've done bad things and now they're being punished.

136
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:16,240
And the second is that even though this world is full of bad things, even for people who don't deserve it, and good things for people who should be being punished, that's going to be made up for in the afterlife.

137
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:22,640
That is, the bad people are ultimately going to get punished for eternity, and the good people are going to get rewarded for eternity.

138
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,599
So this little sort of wobble in the system doesn't matter.

139
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:30,000
It's all going to be fixed in the end.

140
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:36,559
So his answer to that, as you should remember, is: well, children are innocent.

141
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:45,680
You can't say of children that they've done something wrong, and that's why there can be child abuse and they can be tortured and so forth.

142
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:55,279
They don't know right and wrong until they're seven, turns out to be the view that Dostoevsky accepts from the Russian Orthodox Church.

143
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:02,320
That isn't that children don't do bad and nasty things before they're seven, but they don't really know that they're bad and nasty things.

144
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,560
They don't understand good and evil.

145
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,760
Augustine is interesting about this.

146
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:13,000
Augustine wants to argue both that children are innocent and that there is some kind of original sinfulness.

147
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:35,720
And he has this example of how children are sinful from the start because he says, a sibling who has already had all the milk that he or she can take from the mother will be jealous and upset when the other sibling gets the breast and the milk.

148
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:42,120
And that kind of jealousy and upsetness is sin all the way back, Augustine says.

149
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:44,360
And that's probably okay.

150
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:51,320
And Dostoevsky would just say, yes, but that's not the same as doing something wrong that you know is wrong.

151
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320
And children don't do that.

152
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,120
Children are basically sweet and attractive.

153
00:14:58,119 --> 00:15:01,799
That's a bit of an exaggeration for Yvonne.

154
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,920
How old is Kolya?

155
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,199
Does anybody remember?

156
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:05,959
Who is not at all sweet and attractive?

157
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,880
He's over seven, though.

158
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,399
And I think Kolya's about 12.

159
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,440
Keep your eyes open.

160
00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:13,959
Kolya's a test child later in the book.

161
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,439
It plays a big role.

162
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:18,999
But it isn't Kolya, it's Alyusha.

163
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,679
Yeah, keep your eyes open for Alysa.

164
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:23,399
He's younger, and he's the test child.

165
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:30,040
And we'll see if he's nice and gentle and loving, as Yvonne thinks.

166
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:40,999
I think Yvonne is supposed to be sort of not knowing anything about children up close, making this special nice picture of children for reasons that will become obvious in a minute.

167
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,480
So they're supposed to be sweet and lovable, and yet they're made to suffer.

168
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,800
This is on 231, at about eight lines down.

169
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,119
But in the first place, children can be loved even at close quarters, even when they're dirty, even when they're ugly.

170
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:55,920
He doesn't really know.

171
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:06,399
The second reason why I would speak of grown-ups of grown-up people is that besides being disgusting and unworthy of love, they have a compensation.

172
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,880
They've eaten the fruit and no good and evil.

173
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,800
They've become like gods.

174
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:20,399
What he's saying is if older people are hurt and tortured and suffer, it's probably because, or it must be because, they've done something wrong.

175
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:27,679
But children suffer, and they haven't or done anything wrong in the sense that they're innocent.

176
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,960
These are these younger than sevens.

177
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,399
On 235, he tells this story.

178
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:48,560
He tells lots of stories about people who torture children, kill children in front of the eyes of their mother, beat up their own children, whip them, and so forth.

179
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:59,359
And then at the bottom of 234, having told a lot of horror stories already, he says, but I have still better things about children.

180
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:01,439
Those are those nice things.

181
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,519
A great, great deal about Russian children, Alyasha.

182
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:16,880
There was a little girl of five who was hated by her father and mother, worthy and respectable people, and so forth, and they torture her in some way.

183
00:17:16,879 --> 00:17:18,239
I forget how.

184
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,439
It doesn't matter.

185
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:30,879
But what matters at the end of that paragraph, he said, in every man, of course, a demon lies hidden, the demon of rage, the demon of lustful heat at the screams of the tortured victim.

186
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,280
We'll come back to that in a while.

187
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:42,919
But right now, there's evil in the world, and it's people hurting innocent children.

188
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:50,040
And Yvonne thinks that the answer that will get fixed in another world isn't any solution, which is interesting.

189
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,919
One, it doesn't help to punish the abusers.

190
00:17:54,919 --> 00:18:01,719
It just adds more suffering, but that's not going to help the ones who were suffering.

191
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,239
And what about them?

192
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,560
Well, it doesn't help to reward the children since they've already suffered.

193
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:19,719
This is this kind of Kierkegaardian point that it's not going to help them while they're being tortured in various ways to say, well, when I get back and get into paradise, this is all going to look okay to me.

194
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:24,520
It isn't okay when you're in it and you can't see it from the point of view of the future.

195
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:39,399
So it doesn't help anybody that even if there were a God and even if in the afterlife everything was ironed out, it wouldn't justify the suffering that people actually, children, go through.

196
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:45,719
So this is when he says in 238, a higher harmony wouldn't help.

197
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,839
And that's about the middle of the page.

198
00:18:49,639 --> 00:18:50,839
Let's see.

199
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,320
Yeah, the middle of the page.

200
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,680
I renounce the higher harmony altogether.

201
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:09,159
It's not worth the tears of that one tortured child who beat itself on the breast with its little fist and prayed in its stinking outhouse with tears to the dear God and so forth.

202
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:13,960
He says further down at the bottom, I don't want harmony from love of humanity.

203
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:14,599
I don't want it.

204
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:17,240
I would rather be left with this unavenged suffering.

205
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:23,599
I would rather remain with my unavenged suffering and unsatisfied indignation, even if I were wrong.

206
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:26,159
Besides, two higher prices asked for harmony.

207
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:28,560
It's beyond our means to pay it.

208
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,480
Now, that's the argument.

209
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,359
That's why you have to do something.

210
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:36,639
And what you have to do is the crucial thing.

211
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,359
Next sentence is the crucial sentence in the whole argument.

212
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:52,079
So, what do you do once you've got a dossier that proves that the world is a bad place where innocent children are tortured and nobody can make up for it?

213
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,280
He says, and so I give back my entrance ticket.

214
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,560
And if I am an honest man, I get it back as soon as possible, in his case at 30.

215
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,199
And that's why I think it's suicide at 30 for him.

216
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,480
And that I am doing.

217
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,719
It's not God that I don't accept Alyasha, only I most respectfully return the ticket to him.

218
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,759
That's rebellion, murmured Alyasha, looking down.

219
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,520
Rebellion, I'm sorry if you call it that, said Ivan earnestly.

220
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:24,639
But one can't live in rebellion, and I want to live, which is odd, but I guess that's because he's not yet 30.

221
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,520
So now the question is: are we convinced of that argument?

222
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,639
Well, did Yvonne make his case?

223
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:44,800
The test might well be, and Socrates started this, if you're having a kind of philosophical argument with somebody, you win the argument if you convince them.

224
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,120
And that's the test of the argument.

225
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:57,439
I mean, if you convince the person who doesn't want to believe it by giving them arguments that by rationality force them to believe it, then it looks like you've got a good argument.

226
00:20:57,439 --> 00:21:04,159
And so the interesting question is, did he convince Alyasha, who certainly doesn't want to believe it?

227
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,000
And the answer is, yes, he did.

228
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,280
You want to say something?

229
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,320
No, I see.

230
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,679
Sorry, I thought it was you.

231
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,359
239.

232
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:17,399
So at the top, Yvonne says, Tell me yourself.

233
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:18,360
I challenge you.

234
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:19,159
Imagine.

235
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:25,239
Imagine you are creating the fabric of human existence with the object of making man happy in the end and giving them peace.

236
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:41,399
Imagine that you are doing this, but that it's essential and inevitable to torture to death only one tiny creature, that child beating its breast with its fist, for instance, in order to found that Oedipus on its unavenged tears, would you consent to be the architect on those conditions?

237
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:42,280
Tell me.

238
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,159
Tell me, tell the truth.

239
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:48,919
No, I wouldn't consent, said Alyasha, softly.

240
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:54,679
So Alyasha admits he wouldn't agree to create this world.

241
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:08,040
And that means Yvonne has convinced Alyasha, and we're supposed to be convinced, I think, I'm convinced, that the world is unacceptable to any moral person.

242
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,239
And now comes, and therefore we should give back the ticket?

243
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,719
There must be something wrong somewhere.

244
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,760
What is it?

245
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:23,560
Has anybody sort of figured out why Yvonne has got it wrong?

246
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:26,280
What's the mistake or the flaw?

247
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:26,919
Yeah.

248
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,879
In a certain way, yes.

249
00:22:33,879 --> 00:22:35,079
Say more.

250
00:22:49,320 --> 00:23:00,000
Okay, well, that's no, I think it's simpler in a way and more and more direct than that, and more surprising than that, the answer to Yvonne, yeah.

251
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:10,240
The world would be free of moral people, yes, but Yvonne would say that's fine.

252
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,999
I mean, that's better than a world in which these moral people have to subscribe to this bad stuff.

253
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,639
Yeah.

254
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,760
I see.

255
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,759
I don't think it's a logical fallacy, but you're on a very important track.

256
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:47,919
I mean, if he really cares about the suffering, giving back the ticket doesn't seem to be the right response.

257
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:48,960
Hold on to that.

258
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,560
That's you jumped ahead.

259
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,599
In a way, that's awesome as answer to him.

260
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:59,760
But there's a deeper, more interesting, really, I think, flaw in what he's up to.

261
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,320
Yeah.

262
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:24,239
Okay, you're on the track I'm on.

263
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:32,959
I think that's very important and interesting, that in a certain way, you can't give back your ticket.

264
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:42,360
What all that means is part of what's fascinating about this book and this chapter, because the whole answer to this thing is not just in this chapter, but all over the place.

265
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:49,800
But the picture that Yvonne's got is that your relation to the world is a spectator.

266
00:24:49,800 --> 00:25:00,679
It's like being in a play, and if you think the play is vulgar or racist or just stupid or whatever, you can just give back your ticket and leave.

267
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:10,280
Or it's like you're being wooed by some fraternity and sorority, and you discover that they're prejudiced or in some way, and then you just don't join.

268
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,919
But is your relation to the world like that?

269
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:22,040
That you are, that your original position is, so to speak, standing outside it, and then your next question is, shall I join it?

270
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,800
And the answer is, no.

271
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,959
And so what's wrong with his argument?

272
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:34,439
Well, what's wrong with it is, because that's not part of his argument, this position from which he's making the argument.

273
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:45,560
I want to say, in a kind of slogan, what's wrong with his philosophical argument is that it's a philosophical argument.

274
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:51,639
It's an argument from a detached spectator point of view.

275
00:25:52,119 --> 00:26:03,479
He's judging the world as if he were a kind of pure, rational observer of it, which is what philosophers do.

276
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:09,560
Dostoevsky thinks, and Plato does, and lots of philosophers do.

277
00:26:09,879 --> 00:26:22,399
And so the answer to him would be something like: that's not how you are in the world as a spectator with a ticket you can give back.

278
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:25,920
You're always already involved in the world, which he was saying.

279
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:27,040
But you have to spell it out.

280
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,359
You can't just say you're always already involved in the world because once you're born, you're there.

281
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:42,639
You've got to make an argument that Yvonne is not in a position to accept or reject it because he's not a pure, innocent bystander.

282
00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:50,879
He's not, what was the name of his job when he was writing for the newspaper?

283
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:53,440
That's right.

284
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:55,119
He's not an eyewitness.

285
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,679
And how would you argue that?

286
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:14,159
Well, the interesting thing is, Dostoevsky, I think, has a three-part argument which shows that he's completely involved and guilty of the suffering in the world and not an innocent bystander.

287
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:24,479
And that's really what's fascinating, because that's going to tear down not the argument, but the position, the philosophical position from which he's making the argument.

288
00:27:24,639 --> 00:27:31,040
It's a neat existentialist move on the part of Dostoevsky, and he does it quite on purpose.

289
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,959
Okay, so let's start.

290
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,079
For one thing, what about his motivation?

291
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:45,040
Is his motivation for getting so upset about these children just an abstract theoretical observation?

292
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:52,079
And Dostoevsky, this isn't a necessary part of the argument, I don't think, but Dostoevsky sets it up in an interesting way.

293
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:56,079
I'll read you something and then see if you can see what's going on.

294
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:08,520
When he's talking about the children back on 231, if they suffer, the middle of 231, if they too suffer horribly on Earth, they must suffer for their father's sins.

295
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,959
They must be punished for their fathers who have eaten the apple.

296
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:17,240
But that reasoning is of the other world and is incomprehensible for the heart of man here on earth.

297
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:24,119
The innocent must not suffer for another's sin, and especially such innocents, namely the children.

298
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,839
What's special about that?

299
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:32,119
Why is Yvonne motivated by that kind of argument?

300
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:37,079
Why is he especially upset that the children are suffering for their father's sins?

301
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:39,639
Is that something he just arrives at from nowhere?

302
00:28:39,639 --> 00:28:40,359
Yeah.

303
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,040
Ah, you're ahead of the story, way ahead.

304
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:52,280
But that's going to be Alyasha's fallback position, where you are.

305
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:52,919
Yeah.

306
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:55,800
Maybe.

307
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,440
What do you think?

308
00:28:56,439 --> 00:28:57,800
You know, remember the plot?

309
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,520
Did he suffer for his father's sins?

310
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:10,119
He felt terrible being given away as a kind of orphan, having abandoned by his father, embarrassed by, humiliated by his father.

311
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:12,520
Yes, he suffered for his father's sins, he thinks.

312
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,320
Yeah.

313
00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:28,440
Well, I think suffering is fine, and I think Dostoevsky is playing this game.

314
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:34,680
You know, when Dostoevsky is doing anything, I've told you this, he gives you a hint that what's going on.

315
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:46,839
At the end of that paragraph, he says suddenly, the very end, you don't know why I'm telling you all this, Alyasha.

316
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:49,399
My headaches, and I'm sad.

317
00:29:49,720 --> 00:30:01,599
So, I mean, he's really telling, you know, he's really feeling sorry for himself and how he was treated by his father, but he doesn't really understand that very well himself, but he's getting all upset about it.

318
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,000
But that's only the motivation.

319
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,919
That's not the important part.

320
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,879
The important part is, in what sense is Yvonne part of the problem?

321
00:30:10,879 --> 00:30:18,959
That is, part of the suffering that he is pretending or believing that he has nothing to do with.

322
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,599
This is really where it gets remarkable.

323
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,199
Remember now that in Christianity, you're responsible for your desires.

324
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:36,320
We talked about that, didn't we already once, that Jesus made this move in which people became responsible for their desires.

325
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:36,800
Maybe not.

326
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,159
You're all looking puzzled.

327
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,959
You're saying, yes, we did, and she's saying, no, we didn't.

328
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:41,759
Okay.

329
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:49,679
Does this sound familiar when Jesus says on the Sermon on the Mount that you commit adultery, he commits adultery, you lust after a woman in his heart?

330
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,360
That Jesus, did I talk about that?

331
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:52,719
Yeah, he's making this big move.

332
00:30:52,720 --> 00:31:04,639
That's what I thought I talked about, in which instead of what actions you perform, it's what impulses you have, what desires you have that define you, and you're judged on the basis of your desires.

333
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:08,879
So now we want to know, well, what desires does Yvonne have?

334
00:31:08,879 --> 00:31:13,040
And this will come as a big surprise, I think, to you.

335
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,479
It certainly did to me, and it took me years to see it, Dusty S.

336
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,320
He hides it so well.

337
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:21,679
But now, where are we?

338
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:22,719
Let's see.

339
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:33,839
So, Yvonne, on 2.34, oh, he's talking about people being whipped, getting themselves excited up to sensuality.

340
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:37,879
It's the quote on 2.35, which is important.

341
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,839
Do you see anything strange about the claim?

342
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:44,119
In every man, of course, a demon lies hidden.

343
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:49,479
The demon of rage, the demon of lustful heat at the screams of the tortured victim.

344
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,240
Would you subscribe to that?

345
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,720
I mean, I feel, and maybe there's something wrong with me.

346
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,240
I don't feel any demon in me.

347
00:31:57,639 --> 00:32:01,079
I just don't get a big kick out of screams of tortured victims.

348
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:06,040
I don't even like to go to movies in which people get hurt and tortured.

349
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,999
But he's claiming that it's obvious to him.

350
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:17,639
Of course, everybody gets turned on by torture and loves the screams of tortured victims, the lustful heat at those screams.

351
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,879
What does this show about Yvonne?

352
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:22,999
Maybe he's a sadist.

353
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:32,120
I mean, he seems to know firsthand that people are turned on by torture and suffering.

354
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:37,320
Well, if that's all I had to go on, you would be right to say that this is too clever by half.

355
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:47,160
You've got some little speech in which he says he knows that everybody does this, but that's certainly not an argument for claiming that he's sadistic.

356
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:57,640
So, Dostoevsky takes a long time for Dostoevsky to tell you in so many, particularly in so many words, that the, you have to jump ahead to 552.

357
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,280
I spent an hour this morning trying to find this quote.

358
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:07,079
Finally, thanks to Amazon and search the text and then remembering the crucial word in it, I found it.

359
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,599
I knew it was in here somewhere.

360
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,960
So, here you go.

361
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:11,959
This is really quite amazing.

362
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:16,280
Lisa is certainly sadistic.

363
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,640
She has this wonderful dream of a child.

364
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:24,399
I'll start in the middle of 552.

365
00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:34,400
There's a book wherein I read about a trial of a man who took a four-year-old child and cut off the fingers from both hands and crucified him on the wall, hammered nails into him and crucified him.

366
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:38,800
And afterwards, when he was tried, he said that the child died quickly within four hours.

367
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,240
That was quickly.

368
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:45,200
He said the child moaned, kept on moaning, and he stood admiring it.

369
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,560
That's nice.

370
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,800
See, that's why I want nice instead of fine.

371
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,760
You'll see in a, you wouldn't say that's fine.

372
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,480
But if you're a sadist and somebody's done something really terrific, you'd say that's nice.

373
00:33:56,479 --> 00:33:59,999
And Alyasha says, nice.

374
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,839
And then he looks at her and she goes on at the bottom there.

375
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,439
I cried all night.

376
00:34:05,439 --> 00:34:07,999
I kept thinking of how the little thing cried and moaned.

377
00:34:07,999 --> 00:34:09,839
A child of four understands, you know.

378
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,479
And all the while the thought of the pineapple jam haunted me.

379
00:34:12,479 --> 00:34:19,120
Oh, she has these visions that while she's watching the crucified child, she's enjoying pineapple jam.

380
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,680
In the morning, I wrote a letter to a certain person begging him to come and see me.

381
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:28,639
He came and I told him all about the child and the pineapple jam, all about it, all.

382
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,160
And he said it was nice.

383
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,760
Then he got up and went away.

384
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,120
Who was it?

385
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,120
It was Yvonne.

386
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:35,999
It was Yvonne.

387
00:34:35,999 --> 00:34:38,240
Alyasha knows it was Yvonne.

388
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,399
And she says, did he despise me?

389
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,000
Did he despise me?

390
00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:45,359
And Alyasha, they say, did you send for that person?

391
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:45,919
Yes, I did.

392
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:48,879
Did you send him a letter and so forth?

393
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:53,359
And Alyasha says that person behaved honorably and so forth.

394
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:58,959
What she really wants to do is be, I don't know, raped really by Yvonne.

395
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:02,240
Only it's only in dots that she says it.

396
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,520
I forget where.

397
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:12,600
She thinks that she wants to be involved with somebody who tortures her, and she knows that Yvonne is the one, and that he didn't stay around.

398
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,359
He just said, Yeah, that's nice, and left.

399
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:25,239
And Alyasha says, Then he despised me and you too?

400
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,599
When he went out laughing, I felt it was nice to be despised.

401
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,199
I'm in the middle of 553.

402
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,040
The child with fingers cut off is nice, and to be despised is nice.

403
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:35,559
Do you know Alyasha?

404
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,559
Do you know I would like dot, dot, dot?

405
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:38,600
There's the dots.

406
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:48,440
What she wants from Yvonne, I don't know exactly, but she's the perfect masochist, and she immediately knows that he's the perfect sadist, and she wants him around.

407
00:35:48,439 --> 00:35:49,719
So I take that now.

408
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,200
Now you can see that I didn't make it up.

409
00:35:52,200 --> 00:36:03,080
And you'll see again later, I couldn't find this quote in a hurry, that when Yvonne talks to the devil, what he's really interested in is more details about the tortures in hell.

410
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,839
Exactly what do they do?

411
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:06,520
There's no question about it.

412
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:09,080
Yvonne is sadistic.

413
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:19,079
His pure, lofty attitude is really motivated by the dark side.

414
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:24,999
I mean, collecting these nice children's anecdotes turns out to turn him on.

415
00:36:24,999 --> 00:36:26,440
He likes them.

416
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:31,959
And he pretends that he's collecting them, you know, as a refutation against all the evil people.

417
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:35,480
He, Yvonne, who's not involved in any of this evil and torture.

418
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,200
He's relishing the evil and torture.

419
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,839
That's why I think the translation is wrong, to say it's a fine collection.

420
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:47,000
It's a nice collection, just the way she says to be despised is nice.

421
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:49,160
That's the word they're going to use.

422
00:36:49,479 --> 00:37:02,320
Another more sophisticated way of arguing the same point about Yvonne, which Gustaus certainly probably senses, is that Sartre, how many red no eggs did you?

423
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:09,280
Well, okay, you know that for Sartre to be sadistic doesn't mean you have to actually hurt anybody.

424
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:20,160
It means that you want to be the detached bystander who turns them into an object so that they, by staring at them, so they can't turn you into an object by staring at you.

425
00:37:20,399 --> 00:37:25,359
So there's this sort of battle of gazes, and the saddest wins.

426
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:26,240
What's his name?

427
00:37:26,879 --> 00:37:28,160
I forget him.

428
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:29,119
Inez.

429
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,159
Oh, it's a woman.

430
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,000
Inez is the sadist, and I can't remember the other woman.

431
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,760
Anybody remember?

432
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,359
Garcin is the guy.

433
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:46,160
Anyway, Sartre's got a whole theory about how, if you're a detached observer, that is a sadistic attitude.

434
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:52,000
And that's why being an eyewitness, way back, he's setting up Yvonne.

435
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:54,079
And there's a place that I couldn't find.

436
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,040
If any of you happen to see it, tell me where.

437
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:02,400
I know that Foyodor says somewhere, Yvonne isn't one of us, he's observing us.

438
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:05,519
Maybe I should just try to do the search again.

439
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:07,200
I'll probably find it.

440
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,519
The wonders of look inside the books on Amazon.

441
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:12,720
I trust you've discovered this.

442
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,639
It's all full of exciting and fun things to do.

443
00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:24,719
Okay, so Yvonne stance is an observer, and that's a kind of involvement.

444
00:38:24,879 --> 00:38:26,240
That's what's so peculiar.

445
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:31,999
To be a detached observer is to be at a very abstract level, sadistic already.

446
00:38:31,999 --> 00:38:37,160
That is, to be turning everybody else into objects to be observed.

447
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,359
And in Yvonne's case, it's not just abstract.

448
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:45,639
He really has this tendency to observe.

449
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,280
Oh, and I forgot that other quote from Lisa.

450
00:38:48,999 --> 00:38:51,560
I can't resist reading this on 554.

451
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:53,719
Again, none of this is giving away the plot.

452
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,359
But this is about as crazy a thing as the cats.

453
00:38:56,359 --> 00:38:59,240
And again, you think Dostoevsky is just wild.

454
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:08,039
After that conversation, which I just read, in which she's wondering whether Yvonne despises her, and it turns out she hopes he despises her.

455
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:09,400
That would be nice.

456
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:19,639
Then at the end of the whole chapter, as soon as Alyasha had gone, Lisa unbolted the door, opened it a little, put her finger in the crack, and slammed the door with all her might, pinching her finger.

457
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,919
Pinching seems an understatement, I'm brushing her finger.

458
00:39:22,919 --> 00:39:27,560
Ten seconds later, releasing her fingers, she walked slowly, slowly to her chair.

459
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:33,560
She sat up straight in it and looked intensely at her blackened finger and at the blood that oozed out from under the nail.

460
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:39,320
Her lips were quivering and she kept whispering to herself, I am a wretch, a wrench, wretch, a wretch.

461
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,000
That's pretty wild.

462
00:39:40,999 --> 00:39:51,560
And so, anyway, and that's all just to set up Yvonne and bring out the sadistic side of him.

463
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:54,839
And so that's the second argument.

464
00:39:54,839 --> 00:40:03,320
So he's involved because he's motivated to make this collection by feeling sorry for himself and his childhood and his father.

465
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:08,920
He's part of the problem because he really enjoys the torturing of the children.

466
00:40:08,919 --> 00:40:17,800
He's too clean-cut to torture anybody himself, or, it turns out, to kill anybody himself.

467
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:24,639
But you've got to realize that he is also responsible for a lot of the evil in the book.

468
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:29,200
The way the plot is so complicated, this isn't giving anything away.

469
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:53,280
But it's a kind of Graham-Green view that if you pretend to be the innocent and think that you're sort of pure and coming in, so to speak, to the city from the outside to clean things up, like in The Third Man, just as Holly Martin turns out to be the cause of all the deaths in The Third Man, Yvonne may be the cause of all the deaths in the brothers.

470
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:54,240
I'm not sure about that.

471
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,519
You'll have to look into that.

472
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:59,120
But anyway, he's very, very much responsible.

473
00:40:59,439 --> 00:41:07,520
In fact, I found this in reading some notes on the brothers Karamatsov that Dostoevsky wrote while he was writing the book.

474
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,919
He hasn't got a name for Yvonne yet.

475
00:41:09,919 --> 00:41:15,200
He calls him sometimes the educated one and sometimes the murderer.

476
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:19,200
Although, as I say, he's much too clean-cut to murder anybody.

477
00:41:19,999 --> 00:41:24,719
That's so complicated that you couldn't, your minds would boggle if I could try to explain it.

478
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:29,839
But anyway, so he's totally responsible for something very evil.

479
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,960
Somebody gets murdered, and Yvonne is somehow responsible.

480
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:34,480
What's the conclusion?

481
00:41:34,479 --> 00:41:38,240
Well, it's not the logic of his view that's wrong then.

482
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:54,160
It's the philosophical detached position which he claims in making this idea, that he is outside all this bad suffering and has a ticket, and he's so clean-cut that he's not going to get involved in it at all.

483
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,519
He's going to give back his ticket.

484
00:41:55,519 --> 00:42:03,120
Well, now that you've heard the whole case, you can see that that's not at all where he has any right to be standing.

485
00:42:03,439 --> 00:42:09,959
He is a participant, not an eyewitness.

486
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,280
He's part of the problem.

487
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,240
And that's it.

488
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,800
Giving back the ticket just isn't an option.

489
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:22,760
And this is sort of spelling out what you said, but spelling it out specifically for Yvonne.

490
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:35,320
You'd have to, if anybody else around has a view that they're too good for this world and the world that they want to get out of it, you'd have to know their past and why they're how they're involved.

491
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:44,680
But Jostovsky certainly thinks, and now comes the next part of it, that everybody is involved in and responsible for the evil in the world.

492
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,999
Somebody said something like that, said your argument is coming up later.

493
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:57,720
So who said that you should try to make the world better instead of sitting around complaining about the evil?

494
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,079
Somebody somewhere said that.

495
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,959
Anyway, that's Zosima's view.

496
00:43:01,959 --> 00:43:11,480
Zosima is, in a way, in a kind of brilliant Dostoevsky way, the absolute opposition.

497
00:43:11,479 --> 00:43:17,960
So opposite of Yvonne that he is sort of, I think, equally wrong.

498
00:43:17,959 --> 00:43:20,359
But you have to see how it works out.

499
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:32,839
There's something, Zosima never asks the question, how could I possibly forgive all the evil in the world, which is Yvonne's view.

500
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:35,720
He says he would, there's no way to forgive it.

501
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,720
It's just unforgivable that there should be such a bad world.

502
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:50,800
Zosima, on the other hand, and you've read this already if you've kept keeping up on the reading, he feels guilty for all the evil in the world.

503
00:43:50,439 --> 00:43:53,599
That's what I find this fascinating symmetry.

504
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:01,599
Whereas Yvonne feels that nothing bad in the world is his fault, he's a clean-cut person and he gives back his ticket.

505
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:08,560
It isn't as if he's been involved in watching, involved in producing or enjoying this bad play.

506
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:17,680
But Zosima has the, I think, equally crazy view that he's responsible for all the evil.

507
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,720
And he gets there in two steps.

508
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:25,359
I don't know how important it is to Dostoevsky.

509
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,800
I don't even know if Dostoevsky knows he's doing it, but I think he does.

510
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:32,960
And here's the case for it.

511
00:44:32,959 --> 00:44:37,599
But I don't want to get carried away by my peculiar interest in this.

512
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:43,440
I mean, the important thing to keep in mind is what is Zosima's answer to the evil in the world?

513
00:44:43,439 --> 00:44:45,839
That's he's got right, sort of.

514
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,479
And then you can make this little quibble at the end.

515
00:44:48,479 --> 00:44:50,719
Maybe he's got it a little exaggerated.

516
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,080
So let's look at it.

517
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:59,680
So for one thing, he knows that he shouldn't have, that monks in general shouldn't withdraw from the world.

518
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:07,359
It's as if they don't give back the ticket, but they certainly somehow don't get into, don't really get involved in the plague.

519
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:14,960
They hang around outside somewhere, and that's not good, he says at the top of 164.

520
00:45:14,959 --> 00:45:20,079
Because we have come here and shut ourselves within these walls, we are no holier than those outside.

521
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:28,879
But on the contrary, from the very fact of coming here, each of us has confessed to himself that he is worse than others, all men on earth.

522
00:45:28,879 --> 00:45:30,719
That's pretty extreme.

523
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:42,359
One tends to read this, I did for years, as if Zosima is such a nice guy and such a holy guy and so perceptive about everybody else's motivations and suffering.

524
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:44,280
We just should believe what he says.

525
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,480
But I don't think we're supposed to believe the next part, which comes right after that.

526
00:45:49,800 --> 00:46:04,680
And when of two lines, two sentences later, when he realizes that he is not only worse than others, but that he is responsible to all men for all and everything, for all human sins, national and individual, only then can the aim of our seclusion be attained.

527
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:20,120
For know, dear ones, that every one of us is undoubtedly responsible for all men, everything on earth, not merely through the general sinfulness of creation, but each one personally, for all mankind, and every individual man.

528
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,800
That's just nuts.

529
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,839
I mean, you can't really, really believe it.

530
00:46:24,839 --> 00:46:26,599
You can say, isn't that a nice idea?

531
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:37,800
But I'm not going to take responsibility for everything that's going on in Iraq and in Bali and in New York and so forth.

532
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:44,839
Every tortured person, every hungry person, that just doesn't make doesn't seem plausible.

533
00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:50,999
And I think in a certain way, it follows from their withdrawing.

534
00:46:51,320 --> 00:47:05,640
That is, if you get out of the world the way the monks try to do, you don't have any notion anymore of what evil you are able to fix and what evil you aren't, what evil is relevant and what evil isn't.

535
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:11,800
I mean, if you if you're living in Berkeley, you can decide to help the homeless or the whatever.

536
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:21,320
And you can have some local particular evil that you feel involved with and want to make get fix it.

537
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:31,839
But if you withdraw from the world, not as bad as Yvonne withdraws, but still withdraw, you can't tell anymore what evil is really your business.

538
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:38,879
And in a certain sense, Gosimus sits around feeling responsible for all the evil in the world, but he doesn't do anything about any of it.

539
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:46,320
And so, but he does at least have, and this is what I think Dostoevsky is mainly interested in.

540
00:47:46,479 --> 00:47:51,359
I must say I can't help being annoyed at this, but that's not the main point.

541
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:55,920
The main point is that he's got the opposite of Yvonne's stance.

542
00:47:55,919 --> 00:48:09,040
Instead of sitting around complaining about the evil and saying, who could possibly forgive them, he's saying, I'm responsible and asking everybody to forgive him.

543
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:25,359
On page 312, he says, if the evil things men do move you to indignation and overwhelming distress, even to a desire for vengeance on the evildoers, shun all things, shun above all things that feeling.

544
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:29,760
Go at once and seek suffering for yourself as though you yourself were guilty of that wrong.

545
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:39,280
Accept that suffering and bear it, and your heart will find comfort and you will understand that you too are guilty, for you might have been a light to the evildoers and were not a light to them.

546
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:54,480
Well, again, I mean, it's the right idea, sort of the antidote to Yvonne, but it's pretty far-fetched, and it doesn't really do much good to feel guilty and accept suffering instead of going out and doing something about it.

547
00:48:54,479 --> 00:49:07,480
And as somebody said, as I was going to say, the thing one ought to do if they find that there's a lot of evil in the world is go out to fix the evil that they can, that they are partially involved with and responsible for.

548
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:10,280
And finally, it's very important that Yvonne knows this.

549
00:49:10,439 --> 00:49:16,359
It isn't as if I'm hooking this up against Dostoevsky or against Yvonne.

550
00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:19,000
Let me just make sure where I am.

551
00:49:28,519 --> 00:49:33,400
So he doesn't ask how to forgive the bad people and God for the evil in the world.

552
00:49:33,399 --> 00:49:35,320
He asks them to forgive him.

553
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,440
That's fine.

554
00:49:36,439 --> 00:49:38,199
It's the opposite of Yvonne.

555
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,640
That's fine.

556
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:52,680
He's outside of any particular situation, and that's why he can't do anything or really understand the kind of involvement that he's got.

557
00:49:56,519 --> 00:50:10,680
So being a philosopher or being a monk, you either end up denying responsibility for anything if you're a philosopher or in Yvonne's way, or you end up taking responsibility for everything if you're a monk in Zosima's way.

558
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:14,680
And I think neither of them are okay.

559
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,440
And Zosima knows it.

560
00:50:16,439 --> 00:50:23,079
And the evidence that Zosima knows it and thinks that this is not the right way is obvious.

561
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,199
You probably remember.

562
00:50:24,439 --> 00:50:33,879
Do you remember where it becomes clear that besides Zosima saying we are all guilty who have retreated into the monastery, what does he tell Alyasha to do?

563
00:50:34,839 --> 00:50:35,640
Yeah.

564
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,280
That's right.

565
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:42,759
He sends away Alyasha from the monastery for good.

566
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:47,719
And I think that's the evidence that there is something wrong with being in the monastery.

567
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:51,079
The monk position is better than the philosopher's, but it's still not right.

568
00:50:51,359 --> 00:51:01,200
And the only way that the world is going to become better, and a lot of the book, is how Alyasha actually combats local evil, makes the local stuff better.

569
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,919
And in a certain sense, Alyasha is a...

570
00:51:03,919 --> 00:51:06,720
a part of something that makes the whole world better.

571
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,920
But he had to leave the monastery to do it.

572
00:51:09,919 --> 00:51:18,160
And so this is on page 83, the second, the end of the top paragraph in section 7.

573
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,280
He looked intently at Alyasha as though considering something.

574
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:22,640
Then it's a little lower.

575
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,639
When it's God's will to call me, leave the monastery, go away for good.

576
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,560
Alyasha started.

577
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,160
This is not the place for you.

578
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,879
I bless you for great service in the world.

579
00:51:32,879 --> 00:51:36,320
Yours will be a long pilgrimage, and you will have to take a wife, too.

580
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,679
Lisa, for sure.

581
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:44,240
Though how that's going to work out, and the way they are existential doubles, we haven't seen yet.

582
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:53,039
Alyasha is definitely not a sadist, but there is some deep kinkiness in him, which meshes with something in her.

583
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:55,120
It's just too early to talk about it.

584
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,479
Yours will be a long pilgrimage, and you will have to take a wife, too.

585
00:51:58,479 --> 00:52:01,120
You will have to bear all before you come back.

586
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,959
Christ be with you.

587
00:52:02,959 --> 00:52:05,359
Don't abandon him, and he won't abandon you.

588
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:10,080
You will see great sorrow, and in that sorrow you will be happy.

589
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,800
And that's it.

590
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,439
So that's the next step.

591
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:24,000
The next step is to see that you have to go out in the world, combat the evil in the world.

592
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:29,599
But, oh, oh, I have another point here.

593
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:29,999
Sorry.

594
00:52:29,999 --> 00:52:41,719
I want to say one more thing about the proof that Dostoevsky knows that Zosim is wrong in taking responsibility for all the evil in the world and suffering for it.

595
00:52:42,039 --> 00:52:52,839
If you watch, you'll see that Alyasha, even when he leaves the monastery, doesn't take any responsibility for the crime at the center of the book.

596
00:52:52,839 --> 00:52:59,959
He shows, and he doesn't show any compassion for at least two people, Ratitin and Snerzhikov.

597
00:53:00,439 --> 00:53:21,799
In other words, he hasn't got this sort of universal love-your-neighbor attitude, and he hasn't got the, certainly he hasn't got the idea that he's responsible he individually for every bad thing that happens, even in that little town, the name of which means pig sty, that he's not taking responsibility for that.

598
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,839
And that's good, because you want this to be realistic.

599
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:32,200
You don't want it to be at the level of beautiful sort of homilies of the Zosima sort.

600
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,519
Okay, now that's the whole point of that.

601
00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:36,679
It's time to stop and let people say things.

602
00:53:36,999 --> 00:53:41,000
Are you convinced by the story?

603
00:53:40,999 --> 00:53:48,040
Convinced by Yvonne's objection, convinced by the way Dostoevsky sets up, show he's wrong.

604
00:53:48,999 --> 00:53:50,839
You think I made it up?

605
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,039
It took me years to make this case.

606
00:53:54,039 --> 00:53:56,679
People used to think, who used to think I made it up.

607
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:01,959
How could such a nice guy as Yvonne be there enjoying the suffering of these children?

608
00:54:01,959 --> 00:54:04,839
But Dostoevsky has definitely set it up.

609
00:54:04,839 --> 00:54:05,400
Yeah.

610
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:31,760
That's right.

611
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,200
That's interesting.

612
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,639
No, I don't think he has it.

613
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:37,040
He doesn't have another chance.

614
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:38,240
It's a good point.

615
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:47,599
I mean, he doesn't, I sort of was talking about that when I said he sort of says he loves Katerina, but he doesn't really love her, but she is his existential double, of course.

616
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:54,080
She also is pure and lofty and thinks that she's better than everybody else and so forth.

617
00:54:54,879 --> 00:54:57,839
And therefore they've got a lot in common.

618
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,079
And I don't know.

619
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,240
It's a possible paper topic in there.

620
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:07,200
I mean, I haven't thought about the Katerina side a bit.

621
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:17,040
And it's something that one could think about and how much it's like Yvonne and how much it plays a role in motivating this, as you're suggesting this outburst against the world.

622
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:23,359
You certainly have to feel that it's something deep enough that goes clear back to his being a tortured child.

623
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:31,520
But it could be that that sort of triggers him thinking again that he's the suffering one.

624
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:34,000
Okay, anything else?

625
00:55:33,999 --> 00:55:34,560
Yeah.

626
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:40,320
What I was getting is why Arthur should, just to make those match.

627
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:44,720
I wanted him to say something like something about all the stuff, but it should be better.

628
00:55:46,959 --> 00:55:48,160
By Yvonne.

629
00:55:49,439 --> 00:55:51,119
Ah, good, good.

630
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:58,639
I think that's, you're putting your finger on a kind of flaw in the book, but let me think about it a bit, and I'll explain what I mean.

631
00:55:58,879 --> 00:56:00,799
You're at the next stage of it.

632
00:56:01,439 --> 00:56:07,320
The question is sort of, now we want to see, well, how is Ali Osher going to react to this story?

633
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:16,280
I told you how Zosima, in effect, reacts by this overplaying of his own guilt and suffering.

634
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,320
And now Alyasha has heard this whole story.

635
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:22,280
He knows, see, this is a very interesting point.

636
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,839
Alyasha knows there's something wrong with this story.

637
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:29,720
He knows that he's not going to go out and kill himself at 30, and Yvonne shouldn't either.

638
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,839
And he knows that he wouldn't build the world like this.

639
00:56:33,959 --> 00:56:41,800
And he doesn't think there, and he doesn't himself have the power to forgive these torturers.

640
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,480
So what can he do?

641
00:56:43,479 --> 00:56:49,640
Well, what he does is pretty precipitous and not very smart.

642
00:56:49,879 --> 00:56:56,440
And maybe that's fine, because he doesn't, you know, he's the youngest and not, he didn't go to the university and study philosophy.

643
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:00,760
But he makes a very bad move at this point.

644
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:04,200
And it's necessary for the plot that he make this bad move.

645
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,359
And it's probably okay for him.

646
00:57:06,359 --> 00:57:06,839
Let's see.

647
00:57:06,839 --> 00:57:08,600
That's what you're asking about.

648
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:18,760
So Yvonne says the issue is not who's involved or not involved, but how can we forgive such people who do this?

649
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:22,120
And there's nobody who can forgive them, he says.

650
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,439
And they shouldn't be forgiven at all.

651
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,720
And then Alyasha gets confused.

652
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:39,320
And he says, in effect, that there is somebody who can forgive them, Jesus.

653
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:43,640
Because Jesus took on himself all the suffering of the world.

654
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:51,039
And having taken on this suffering, he has the right to forgive everybody.

655
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:57,599
It's a confused point, and Alyasha never succeeds in really developing it.

656
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:00,320
Let me tell you where we are.

657
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:10,960
So Zosima thinks you should base your involvement in your guilt and ask everybody else to forgive you.

658
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:16,879
He thinks the question is not who has the right to forgive, but who has the right to blame?

659
00:58:16,879 --> 00:58:20,479
And that's a good move to get beyond Yvonne.

660
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:25,280
But when Yvonne asks, is there anyone who has the right to forgive everybody?

661
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:31,600
Alyasha, just in sort of the converse of Zosima, who asked everybody to forgive him.

662
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:35,759
So Alyasha says, is there somebody who has the right to forgive everybody?

663
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,080
And he says, yes.

664
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:48,400
Jesus does it because he's sinless and he suffered and in his suffering he made up for all the suffering in the world.

665
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:50,639
That's such a crazy argument.

666
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:54,559
On 2.39 is where it happens.

667
00:58:56,479 --> 00:59:04,960
This is right after he said he's pushed into the corner by the argument and he won't admit that he would create the world.

668
00:59:04,959 --> 00:59:14,079
And then he says, no, I can't admit it, says Alyasha suddenly, with flashing eyes.

669
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:18,799
He wouldn't admit having a world like this.

670
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,040
He wouldn't consent to it.

671
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:28,000
And then he says, but Yvonne, you asked just now, is there a person in the whole world who has the right to forgive and can forgive?

672
00:59:27,999 --> 00:59:35,760
But there is a being, and he can forgive everything, all and for all, because he gave his innocent blood for all and everything.

673
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:45,160
You've forgotten him, and on him is built the edifice, and it is him they cry aloud to, Thou art just, O Lord, for thy ways are revealed.

674
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,640
Well, there's lots wrong with that.

675
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:53,160
Mostly what's wrong with it is that Dostoevsky can't make any sense of it.

676
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,920
And I'm afraid neither can I.

677
00:59:54,919 --> 01:00:04,680
I mean, Dostoevsky manages to take every Christian symbol and interpret it, like the baptism one is the only one you've seen so far, but I gave you that long list.

678
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:10,600
Even the crucifixion is in there as the right way to understand suffering.

679
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:34,280
But the one thing he can't do very well, though he tries, is to explain how one person could suffer for everybody and thereby be completely innocent and yet crucified and thereby suffering for everybody, somehow free everybody of their guilt and make them and forgive them.

680
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,320
It just doesn't work.

681
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:58,999
I mean, you'll see in the book when you get there how it doesn't work and which one of the three brothers tries to suffer for all of humanity and how crazy it is and how and Dostoevsky has no way of demagicalizing what's called this vicarious suffering on the cross and how it sort of balances the books.

682
01:00:58,999 --> 01:01:00,839
He just doesn't know what to do with it.

683
01:01:00,839 --> 01:01:07,719
But he gives it to Alyasha and Alyasha tries it and it gets trashed by Yvonne.

684
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,320
That's where we are on 239.

685
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:19,560
So Alyasha makes the move and makes the wrong move, says, okay, the way to answer this problem is just to bring in Jesus and his innocence and his suffering.

686
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:22,879
And Yvonne says, ah, the one without sin and his blood.

687
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:24,879
No, I haven't forgotten him.

688
01:01:24,879 --> 01:01:27,600
And what is he going to do?

689
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,160
Well, he hasn't forgotten him.

690
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:35,760
He's going to make a whole, what he calls poem, which is not really rhymes.

691
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:42,240
He's going to write a whole kind of play about Jesus and his innocence.

692
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,560
And that's the Grand Inquisitor story.

693
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:48,639
So Alyasha makes, I think Alyasha makes this wrong move.

694
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:49,839
You're the one.

695
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:50,719
Who said this?

696
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:51,119
Yeah.

697
01:01:51,120 --> 01:02:00,320
I think Alyasha makes this quick wrong move just because he doesn't, he wants, Dostoevsky wants to get the Grand Inquisitor story in here.

698
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:11,600
And it's true that it's not clear what right move Alyasha at this stage of his innocence and his youth and so forth and lack of understanding of the world could make.

699
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:19,760
Alyasha doesn't really understand what the right way to behave is until he leaves the monastery.

700
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:30,800
So, but the interesting thing is, Dostoevsky hates the idea of Jesus as the one without sin and his innocent blood.

701
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,679
Dostoevsky doesn't have to buy all of Christianity.

702
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:42,320
He's remaking Christianity, like Kierkegaard, according to their own understanding, their own existential phenomenology.

703
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:55,359
And he can't, he thinks that if Jesus was completely innocent, he wouldn't be able to help anybody, and he would cause a whole lot of trouble.

704
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:58,800
The trouble is in the Grand Inquisitor story, and we're not ready for that.

705
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:03,200
But I just want to fill you in on other books of Dostoevsky's.

706
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,800
And there is The Idiot, namely.

707
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:05,919
Anybody read The Idiot?

708
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:09,479
Very few people, it seems to me, understand The Idiot.

709
01:03:09,479 --> 01:03:25,079
But I think, and I think there's some notes of Dostoevsky's, where he says somewhere, in some notebook or something, that in The Idiot he's trying to combine Jesus and Don Quixote, which is meaning a crazy person trying to do good.

710
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:33,000
See, The Idiot is so pure, so innocent in that book, that he tells people the truth even when it breaks them.

711
01:03:32,999 --> 01:03:39,720
He tells people who want him to love them, I forget the woman's name, that he doesn't love her because he's just honest.

712
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:45,800
He's absolutely ruthlessly honest, and by the end of the book, everybody's life has been destroyed.

713
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:53,240
It's not as if it's not about how if Jesus came back, the bad world would destroy everybody, destroy him.

714
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,759
That's how people read the book.

715
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,600
I think that can't be right.

716
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:09,400
It's that if there was such a pure, innocent person with the power of God to do things to people, he would be destructive.

717
01:04:09,399 --> 01:04:12,680
And that's part of what I think.

718
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:32,600
Another thing that is not just me, it's clear that Dostoevsky thinks that in order to really help people, you've got to have experience the dark side and have evil in your past, which you integrated and overcome, but which you understand, because it's still part of you.

719
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,760
I mean, that's what the idiot doesn't have.

720
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:37,320
And notice, how about Zosima?

721
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,320
Was he a nice boy?

722
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:40,839
Remember?

723
01:04:40,839 --> 01:04:42,440
What did he do?

724
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:45,240
What was his job?

725
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,679
He was an army officer.

726
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:51,200
And how did he treat his orderly?

727
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:52,160
Remember?

728
01:04:53,439 --> 01:04:55,599
He slapped him so hard that he bled.

729
01:04:55,600 --> 01:05:08,079
He was brutal and ruthless guy before he became transformed for reasons and in ways we have to talk about later into the Zosima we know.

730
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:12,160
But it's very important that he had this brutal past.

731
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,520
And then, yeah.

732
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:26,399
I don't think I understand your question here.

733
01:05:26,399 --> 01:05:32,720
Are you asking about how Zosima bowed down to Dimitri and said he bowed down to the suffering in store for him?

734
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:37,119
I see.

735
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:38,240
Yes, that's right.

736
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:45,359
Dimitri says he's a bug and he doesn't sort of hit people, but he's particularly nasty to women.

737
01:05:45,999 --> 01:05:59,359
But yes, Dimitri also has to have a bad past to get over it, but he's not going to come out of it a sort of saintly person, but at least a very good person.

738
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:05,520
And bowing down to the suffering in store for him, we have to wait and talk about later.

739
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:07,599
But there's one more, the possessed.

740
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,359
How many read the possessed?

741
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:10,240
Anybody?

742
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,760
There is Father Tihon.

743
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,679
He takes the place of Zosima.

744
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:20,239
He is the wise, good person who understands the human heart and who's loving and so forth.

745
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,479
So you don't know what Tijon was before that.

746
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:23,999
He was an alcoholic.

747
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:39,559
It's just absolutely central to Dostoevsky that if you don't partake in the dark side of being a human being, you can't be a saving, compassionate person.

748
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:54,679
You can pretend to be like Katerina or Yvonne, but you can't really, and you can't, even if you're totally innocent, like the idiot, you're not able to understand and help people if you're like that.

749
01:06:55,080 --> 01:07:12,439
So that's why he jumps on, Dostoevsky gangs up with Yvonne, so to speak, at this point, against Alyasha, and is going to attack the view of Jesus as the completely innocent, the one without sin.

750
01:07:12,439 --> 01:07:13,799
That's the crucial phrase.

751
01:07:13,799 --> 01:07:15,639
There isn't any one without sin.

752
01:07:15,639 --> 01:07:26,119
I mean, the Catholic Church goes to a whole lot of trouble to make Jesus have a mother born, he's born without sin from Mary, who's born without sin from her mother.

753
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:42,200
That's the Immaculate Conception leading to the virgin birth, all to keep this, do just what Dostoevsky does not want to do, to de-animalize, dark, and earthyize Jesus.

754
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:46,599
So now we're ready to read, and we still have a little time.

755
01:07:46,599 --> 01:08:02,119
We're ready to start looking at the Grand Inquisitor story because there you get a picture of Jesus as Yvonne understands him, which is as the one who's completely innocent without sin.

756
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:23,119
Because I remember now that the Grand Inquisitor story is told by Yvonne to Alyasha to refute the idea that if there were a Jesus-like person without sin, he would make a mess of the world.

757
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:33,759
And if, by the way, if you don't realize that, you think that Jesus is the hero of the Grand Inquisitor story.

758
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:36,879
How many have read the Grand Inquisitor story already?

759
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:42,960
How many read it outside of the Brothers Karamatsov in some other course somewhere, just as a little pamphlet?

760
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:43,759
You can do that.

761
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:45,119
You, okay.

762
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,559
And you too.

763
01:08:46,559 --> 01:08:51,200
When you did, in a course, I presume, was it clear?

764
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:56,559
Who seemed to be the winner, so to speak, the right guy, the Grand Inquisitor or Jesus?

765
01:08:56,719 --> 01:08:57,599
Your course.

766
01:08:57,599 --> 01:08:58,719
Jesus, you see?

767
01:08:58,719 --> 01:08:59,759
Bad news.

768
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:01,839
And it's what happens when you take it out of the book.

769
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,200
In your course, too?

770
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,479
Isn't that amazing?

771
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:06,879
Well, keep your eyes open.

772
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,399
It's not like that.

773
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:19,519
And when you see that it's being told by Yvonne to destroy the picture of Jesus as this perfect person, you won't fall for that unless you're really stupid.

774
01:09:19,519 --> 01:09:29,439
And I'm going to read you something from somebody who was obviously really stupid, and that's a guy named Verdayev, who considers, people consider one of the best interpreters of Dostoevsky.

775
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:31,679
After all, he's a Russian existentialist.

776
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:33,999
I think he even knew Dostoevsky.

777
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:43,200
And when he writes about the Grand Inquisitor, he says, the legend of the Grand Inquisitor contains the best of the constructive part of Dostoevsky's religious ideas.

778
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:53,280
It's noteworthy that the extremely powerful vindication of Christ, which is what the legend is, should be put in the mouth of the atheist Ivan Karamatsov.

779
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:56,799
That's just mind-boggling in its stupidity.

780
01:09:56,799 --> 01:10:10,119
Because you, I mean, you, if, if, if you get the conclusion that there is an atheist in there defending Jesus, you should wonder whether maybe you've made a mistake somewhere in your reasoning and not just say, isn't that interesting?

781
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:13,240
That this, it's, it's not of indication.

782
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:18,519
You look for it on your own and see what good he does the world.

783
01:10:18,519 --> 01:10:20,839
But we better sort of back up.

784
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:24,999
We still have five minutes to set it up so that you can read it carefully.

785
01:10:26,439 --> 01:10:34,679
Because you would be off on a little bit of a wrong track if you just thought that Jesus was the bad guy.

786
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:38,359
So let's look at the structure of the argument.

787
01:10:39,799 --> 01:10:44,999
What the Grand Inquisitor story really is, is an antinomy.

788
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,599
I can write that on the board.

789
01:10:46,599 --> 01:10:55,240
It's a philosophical kind of argument, which I'll explain how it works in a minute, and it's along the diagram that you've got.

790
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,000
So see how to spell it.

791
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:00,039
And isn't that right?

792
01:11:00,359 --> 01:11:00,919
Yeah.

793
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:13,399
In an antinomy, you get two opposite views which are presented as the only possible alternatives.

794
01:11:13,399 --> 01:11:21,079
And then you show each side argues for its truth by showing that the other side is hopeless, can't be right.

795
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:26,200
So in Kant, whom I mention every once in a while, but never, did I ever write on the board?

796
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,320
I probably did at some point.

797
01:11:27,399 --> 01:11:35,879
They say, Kant has a whole section of the critique of pure reason called the antinomies, and he gives four of them.

798
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:38,999
But I just give you one for an example.

799
01:11:39,000 --> 01:12:02,719
So, if you think that the only two alternatives about space are that space goes on forever, or else it's finite, you discover that neither view is tolerable, and you show you can the if you think space goes on forever, then the other side can point out that that's impossible.

800
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:11,679
That would be something like an actual infinite, but in infinite isn't a sort of big number, there can't be an actual infinite, so there must be a limit to space.

801
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:20,399
And the other side says, Okay, but then so then the other side comes back and says, Yeah, but what would there be on the other side of this limit?

802
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:21,599
I used to worry about that.

803
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:30,160
You come to the edge of space and then you look to see if there's anything on the other side, and it looks like there's more space out there.

804
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:32,479
So, and Kant thinks there's a third position.

805
01:12:32,479 --> 01:12:33,599
I'm not going to tell you what it is.

806
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:36,320
You could take the Kant course later if you want to find out.

807
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:42,079
But the whole, and you get the same thing with time: is there a beginning of time?

808
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:48,639
Well, if there isn't, time has been going on forever, but forever is too big for anything ever to be.

809
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:50,639
So, it must have started somewhere.

810
01:12:50,639 --> 01:12:51,599
But then, when?

811
01:12:51,599 --> 01:12:55,919
And, you know, and when in time, and how did it get started?

812
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,799
And that doesn't make any sense either.

813
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:11,039
So, antinomies are positions which each side argues against the other side by showing that the other side is untenable, so they must be right.

814
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:18,639
And the only way to fix an antinomy is to find that there's a third possibility that hasn't been considered.

815
01:13:18,639 --> 01:13:24,079
Now, let's just look at the antinomy as it's set up in the Grand Inquisitor story.

816
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:28,719
And so you'll know who the players are just in time before time is up.

817
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:46,119
It's interesting and important that the Grand Inquisitor story begins with talking about the fact that there, I didn't mark it because I didn't know I was going to get quite this far, but it talks about a great heresy that happens in the 15th century.

818
01:13:46,359 --> 01:13:47,799
What is that?

819
01:13:47,799 --> 01:13:48,519
You know?

820
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:49,799
Yeah.

821
01:13:50,439 --> 01:13:52,200
The Protestant Reformation.

822
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:53,719
That's Luther.

823
01:13:53,719 --> 01:13:57,240
And so, and there is, of course, the Grand Inquisitor.

824
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,679
And what is he?

825
01:13:58,679 --> 01:14:00,519
I mean, what religion is he?

826
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:04,359
He's the Roman Catholic Church, the Grand Inquisitor.

827
01:14:04,359 --> 01:14:15,559
And what's going on is, in this antinomy, is the Roman Catholic Church versus the Lutheran view.

828
01:14:15,559 --> 01:14:18,999
And of course, the Grand Inquisitor is on the side of the Roman Catholic Church.

829
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:26,039
It turns out that Jesus is giving a very Kierkegaardian argument.

830
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:32,119
I'm going to, in fact, read you bits of Kierkegaard at certain points because it's so much.

831
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:42,919
Dostoevsky, like such a genius, sort of invented Kierkegaard almost verbatim in some of what the Grand Inquisitor says Jesus says.

832
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:54,119
Remember, when you read it, you will remember if you have already, Jesus doesn't say anything, but the Grand Inquisitor attributes a view to Jesus, which Dostoevsky attributes to the Protestants.

833
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:59,959
And the Grand Inquisitor defends a view, which Dostoevsky is attributing to the Roman Catholics.

834
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:04,759
Now, don't get hung up, I've got one more minute, worrying about whether that's fair.

835
01:15:04,759 --> 01:15:07,879
He's not fair to either the Protestants or the Catholics.

836
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,719
He's doing something else.

837
01:15:09,719 --> 01:15:25,359
He's extrapolating their view to the absolute logical limit, as he takes it, and trying to show how each one of them, if they're the only alternatives, would show that you've got to take the other one.

838
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:26,959
That's the antinomy.

839
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:34,320
And I won't tell you, but you try to figure out by next time what's the third position that will solve the antinomy.

840
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,479
We'll find out next time.
