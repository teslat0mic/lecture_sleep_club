1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
He, that is Merzhikov, met Yvonne with a slow, silent gaze and was apparently not at all surprised at his coming.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,919
There was a great change in his face.

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,840
He was much thinner and more sallow.

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:11,119
His eyes were sunken.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,880
There were blue marks on him.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:20,159
He's back thick and wasting away again because he's feeling repudiated.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,760
He's very ill, it turns out.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,200
And what Martha says about him on 587 is he's not himself.

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,600
That's the middle of 587.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,519
Merzhikov was very ill.

11
00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:39,279
It's not that he's laid up, but he doesn't seem himself.

12
00:00:39,279 --> 00:00:42,800
Well, that's sort of one of those Dostoevsky little tricks.

13
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,880
Remember, and it's important for you to remember, that he hasn't got a self.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:54,959
That the self means the two factors, both a dark side and a light side, or an earthy side and a heavenly side.

15
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:57,519
He's got no self at all.

16
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,400
And that's what, remember Gregory says that to him.

17
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,719
That was his negative childhood memory.

18
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,320
You are not a human being.

19
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,560
You grew from the mold in the bathhouse.

20
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,040
That's all sort of, you're being reminded of that, that he doesn't seem himself.

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,959
But that's not important yet.

22
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,919
Let's just sort of put on hold.

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,959
He's lost his ability to live.

24
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,279
He's lost his ability to act.

25
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:37,880
Since he has no self, and he gets all of what motives he has from Ivan, and now he hates Yvonne, since Yvonne has not congratulated him, but repudiated him, his deed.

26
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:41,559
So that's the situation.

27
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:49,000
And Yvonne...

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,440
really doesn't know.

29
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,399
I think it's, again, again, so murky.

30
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,440
Yvonne suspects that Smershakov did it.

31
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,000
But he knows that Dmitry didn't do it.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,359
But it's really not absolutely who did it until this minute.

33
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:12,839
And then finally, Smershakov just announces that he did it, and that settles then.

34
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,719
And he says he did it because Yvonne wanted him to.

35
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,760
And that's on page 589.

36
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,120
Finally, it all gets sorted out.

37
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,279
The middle of 589.

38
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,480
You are the murderer?

39
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,679
He says to, sorry, this is Smershikov talking to Yvonne.

40
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,120
You murdered him.

41
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,240
You are the murderer.

42
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,039
I was only your instrument, your faithful servant.

43
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,440
It was following your words that I did it.

44
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,880
That's the sort of, you hired me as a hitman line.

45
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,919
That's how Smershikov understands it.

46
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,959
Did it?

47
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:55,240
Did you murder him?

48
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,839
That's the first time Yvonne has fully realized it.

49
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,600
Up to now, he's just dimly thought about it.

50
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:08,200
He thought about it enough to want to kill Smerzhikov, but still.

51
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:10,279
Did you murder him?

52
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:11,480
Yvonne turned cold.

53
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:14,679
Something seemed to give way in his brain, and he shuddered all over.

54
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:25,600
Noticed, and another translation says with a cold shiver, all that is the coldness that you associated with the devil and with the people who betray and kill people close to them.

55
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,919
Smerzhikov looked at him wonderingly.

56
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,880
The genuineness of Ivan's horror struck him.

57
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:38,240
You don't mean to say you really didn't know, Smerzhikov faltered mistrustfully, looking with a forced smile into Ivan's eyes.

58
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,320
Ivan gazed at him, unable to speak.

59
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,440
And here's the evidence about why the peasant song upset him so much.

60
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,120
Ach Vanka's gone to Petersburg.

61
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,760
I won't wait till he comes back, suddenly echoed in his head.

62
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,279
Yes, that's right.

63
00:03:52,800 --> 00:04:04,079
That line now means what it meant to Yvonne all along, that Vanka, that means Ivan, that's his nickname, has gone off to Moscow, Petersburg, it doesn't matter.

64
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,120
And Smershikov isn't going to wait till he comes back.

65
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,200
He's going to kill Fedor right away.

66
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,840
Because, this is the crucial thing, he thought Ivan wanted him to do it.

67
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,919
He has no motives of his own.

68
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,600
In the middle of 290.

69
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:22,720
Did you really not know till now, Smerzhikov asked once more?

70
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:23,680
No, I did not know.

71
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,599
I kept thinking of Dmitri, Dmitri.

72
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,599
He clutched his head in both hands.

73
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:31,200
Listen, did you kill him alone, with my brother's help or without?

74
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,000
It was only with you, your help, I killed him.

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,679
Dmitry is innocent.

76
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,320
All right, all right, talking about it later.

77
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,399
Why do I keep trembling?

78
00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:49,360
You were bold enough, this is Smershikov, then you said, everything is lawful, and how frightened you are now, Smerzikov muttered in surprise.

79
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:54,320
And that's how Ivonne caused it.

80
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,559
In effect, he said to Smershikov, murder is okay.

81
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,559
Because this is Ivonne's view, God is dead, and all things are possible.

82
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:10,599
And since Smerzekhikov gets all his belief from Yvailable, he then just gets the belief that murder is okay.

83
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:20,519
So that's the sense in which he not only wanted him to do it, but gave him, so to speak, the license to do it.

84
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:28,360
And then, let me see, I just want to get to the crucial line.

85
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,120
So Ivan's the real murderer.

86
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,519
It's first degree murder.

87
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:37,159
And at least so it seems.

88
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,080
Again, he's repeating it, Smerchikov on 292, about two-thirds down.

89
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:45,959
No, he didn't kill him, that is Dmitry.

90
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:56,360
But I don't want to lie to you, because if you really haven't understood and are not pretending so as to throw your guilt on me, you are still responsible for it all.

91
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:04,599
Since you suspected murder and wanted me to do it and went away knowing all about it, so I want to prove to you that you were the real, the only real murderer.

92
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:07,079
I'm not the murderer, though I did kill him.

93
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,919
You were the real murderer.

94
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,639
So Yvonne is cracking up.

95
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,120
Why?

96
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:13,240
Why am I the murderer?

97
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:18,200
Oh, God, cried Yvonne, unable to restrain himself, and so forth and so forth.

98
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,719
Now, that does it.

99
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:24,360
I mean, Yvonne, we now understand.

100
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,719
He understands.

101
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,880
But there's now a new murky element that's fascinating.

102
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:34,400
In the middle of 593, and I, since you've been very good at getting the last one.

103
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,440
Let's see if you can help with this one.

104
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,360
The very middle.

105
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,479
Was I so eager then?

106
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,120
Was I, Yvonne cried.

107
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:43,560
To be sure you were.

108
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,759
This was the crucial part.

109
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,480
By your consent, you silently sanctioned my doing it.

110
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,320
Smershikov looked steadily at Yvonne.

111
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:58,240
He was very weak, you know, totally unplugged, and spoke slowly and warily, that some inner force urged him on.

112
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:00,720
He evidently had some design.

113
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:02,320
Ivan felt that.

114
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,880
Now, I don't know if any of you know yet.

115
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,839
You have to read it more than once, what design Smershikov had.

116
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,360
Do you know what Smerchikov is up to?

117
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:15,120
Why does he have any design?

118
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:20,720
He has lost all of his will to live and all of his motives by getting disconnected.

119
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:22,880
Well, that's very subtle.

120
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:29,920
So we won't, and I'm not ready quite to give us, to make the problem as clear as it has to be.

121
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,040
It takes a while.

122
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,719
So let's see where we are.

123
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,240
I just wrote again here, but it's worth reading again.

124
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:51,680
In a certain way, Yvonne did hire Smershikov to do it.

125
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,359
And in another sense, he didn't.

126
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:56,720
He would never commit a murder, horrified by it.

127
00:07:56,719 --> 00:07:58,479
So Alyasha's right.

128
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,839
Ivan's not the kind of person who would kill old Karamatsov, and he hasn't killed old Karamatsov.

129
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,320
But Smershikov is right, too.

130
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:13,759
It's exactly the way Ivan behaved with Smershikov that is solely responsible in the finalist responsibility.

131
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:26,719
Everybody's got some responsibility, but the most responsibility is that Ivonne gave to Smershikov the permission to do it and made it clear that he wanted him to do it.

132
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:35,560
So the moral is that we're responsible not only for a lot more good than we normally realize, but we're responsible for causing a lot more evil than we normally realize.

133
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:41,880
That's the theme that comes up every once in a while and coming up again now.

134
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:47,800
And now comes the next strange event.

135
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,480
This is the one that you now need to explain.

136
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:55,079
So Smershikov gets weaker and weaker.

137
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:57,960
And he has some design.

138
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:02,680
He's lost his will to live, and he won't live for long.

139
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:08,120
And yet, and this is the peculiar part, he commits suicide.

140
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:09,400
That's the puzzle.

141
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,960
Why doesn't he just waste away?

142
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:29,079
Or that is, in the possessed, which probably none of you have read, the main character who is also very evil and has no real motivations of his own, dies of kind of lack of the energy to do anything, really sort of wastes away.

143
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:35,079
And if Smershikov would have just waited a little while, he surely would have died, unplugged from Yvonne.

144
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:37,160
But he doesn't wait a little while.

145
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:45,720
He goes in and commits what critics have thought is an act of guilt and repentance.

146
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,360
Now, surely that's wrong.

147
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,560
But Dostoevsky is playing this strange game with people.

148
00:09:53,719 --> 00:10:09,880
It's as if he wants to mislead the stupid critics because he's got this book lying on the table at the bottom of 590 that he that Smershikov's been reading the sayings of the Holy Father Isaac the Syrian.

149
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:13,079
And the money is hidden under there.

150
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,560
But why is he reading it?

151
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:24,560
Well, I'm not sure I know, but if you go back and look at the writings of Ivan Theory, and which I did, is it Ivan?

152
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,440
Is that his name?

153
00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:27,040
What's his first name?

154
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,640
Now I forgot.

155
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,720
Isaac, yeah, that didn't sound right.

156
00:10:30,719 --> 00:10:31,999
Isaac the Syrian.

157
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:34,720
You discover that he's a father of Pharaoh.

158
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:42,800
He is very gloomy, and he thinks that the best thing people can do is live alone in the desert and eat roots and be silent and so forth.

159
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:51,920
So presumably, Smershikov is reading it because it's blooming, not because he's become suddenly converted to some dark form of Christianity.

160
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,480
But it just makes it harder for the critics who don't understand the suicide.

161
00:10:56,479 --> 00:11:09,599
But then you can see why people would be tempted to say that Smershikov must feel guilty and see that he, in a sense, had misunderstood Ivan and was really he that was responsible.

162
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:15,040
This is the story the critics tell themselves, and therefore he's punishing himself and hung himself, and this is all nonsense.

163
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,880
But then you need a right answer.

164
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,280
Why did he hang himself?

165
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:26,160
And why did he leave this note, which is very interesting in what it doesn't say?

166
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,160
Where do we have to find the note?

167
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,040
619, maybe?

168
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,560
Well, 619 is important, but it's not what I want.

169
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,320
593.

170
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,160
We've got to find the suicide.

171
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,400
If anybody finds it, just yeah.

172
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,720
Where do we hear about it?

173
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:59,040
At the trial?

174
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,360
I'm completely puzzled.

175
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,760
Well, who knows?

176
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,520
Nobody's going to hear it.

177
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:23,240
I've got it written down.

178
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,280
Well, let's put it aside for a minute.

179
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,400
It'll probably show up.

180
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:37,960
Anyway, Smerzhikov does leave a suicide note saying nothing, saying in effect, I just killed myself and I'm not putting the blame on anyone.

181
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:47,400
And as one of the prosecutors says, if he was feeling guilty for the murder and wanted to assume responsibility for the murder, then he certainly would have said so.

182
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,839
He would have said, I did it, and I feel bad about it, and I'm killing myself.

183
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:51,800
And he didn't.

184
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,920
So we just have to keep open what's going on.

185
00:12:58,119 --> 00:13:04,919
And I think you can see on 619, Alyasha understands what's going on.

186
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,160
Well, do you understand what's going on?

187
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:07,960
Well, why?

188
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:16,999
What's this strange design that Smerzhikov had that is carried out, presumably, by him killing himself?

189
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,079
And why is this?

190
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:19,560
Yeah.

191
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,320
Save him.

192
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,440
Einstein's service.

193
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,480
Einstein's top.

194
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,599
It's the time.

195
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,680
Ah, you got the right facts, but you got the wrong conclusion.

196
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:55,520
If Smerzhikov kills himself, no one will believe Yvonne's claim that he's guilty, that he put Smerzhikov up to it, that Smerzhikov really did it.

197
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,280
There'll be no evidence, right?

198
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,560
You're absolutely right.

199
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,359
And Yvonne can't be sent to Siberia, even if he confesses, right.

200
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:10,400
This is what Alyasha says, and you're on the right track, that you got it switched off at one point.

201
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:18,880
The middle of 619, Alyasha says in his prayer, yes, if Smerzhikov was dead, no one will believe Yvonne's evidence.

202
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:28,560
Now, assuming that Smerzhikov wants to hurt Yvonne, because he really hates Yvonne now, and we'll see that go back to the third interview.

203
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:31,760
Yvonne is now the god that fails, so to speak.

204
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,959
He's the center of Merzhikov's life, and he won't play that role.

205
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:39,359
So take my word for it.

206
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:43,200
If he hates Yvonne, why would it be a good thing to do just what you thought?

207
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,440
Make it impossible for Yvonne to confess and go to prison?

208
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,239
That's good.

209
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:09,120
That's half of it.

210
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,239
I think that's right.

211
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:14,160
And if you can spin it another way, too, which I'm not against that.

212
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:28,079
Yes, I think it's right that Yvonne wants to be approved of and to confess it and show that he's better than everybody, and that he admits he wants to kill his father, and he admits he did it, and now nobody was going to believe him.

213
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:39,799
And but the other half of the story is, think of how Yvonne will heal the rest of his life if Dimitri is in Siberia for having committed a crime that now Yvonne feels he's the one who did it.

214
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:45,559
And so Smershikov is putting him in this amazingly awful position by killing himself.

215
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:47,479
That seems to be the strange design.

216
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:50,760
Unless anybody's got a better idea, I go with that one.

217
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:51,400
Yeah.

218
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:02,680
The mysterious visitor, like he's connecting it, right.

219
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,080
That's right, it's like being in the hell of isolation.

220
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,320
Of course, the mysterious visitor, nobody believed him either.

221
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:10,599
It's rather complicated.

222
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:27,639
But he had really become a good man so that though they didn't believe that he'd committed the murder, because they thought he was such a good person all along, that at least he could now relate to them in a way that was honest from his side and not wrong from their side.

223
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,639
So bringing in the mysterious visitor probably doesn't help much, but go ahead.

224
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:31,799
Yeah.

225
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:01,479
That's good.

226
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,160
That that's very good.

227
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,880
That's right.

228
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,200
So yeah, there are two levels to what you said.

229
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:18,200
One level is, yeah, Dimitri is already, sorry, Yvonne is already an example of the bad kind of crucifixion, the laceration kind, the kind that sort of wallows in its own suffering out of pride.

230
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:28,160
But now, if Smerzhikov kills himself, then Yvonne is sort of stuck in that kind of suffering forever.

231
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:38,880
He can't confess and become like the mysterious, get people to forgive him and be willing to take on and so forth.

232
00:17:39,120 --> 00:18:06,799
He's just, well, yeah, he's stuck in this wrong kind of confession, which can't, I'm just trying to say it as best I can, can't lead to expiation and thereby joy and reconciliation, because he could only expiate the crime if people believed he committed it and sent him to Siberia, which they don't, and won't, and didn't.

233
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,839
So Dmitri got, so Smerzhikov got what he wanted by committing suicide and leaving this note.

234
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,559
He could have also not committed suicide, it just occurs to me.

235
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,039
He could have just kept quiet and not said anything.

236
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:43,120
So it's a combination of committing suicide and as the most sort of efficient way of not being bothered and not saying anything, in any way, not having any reason to go on living, and at the same time putting Ivan into a sort of hell, a hell of isolation, in which he is guilty of a crime and can't relate to anybody because nobody believed him.

237
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,079
You want to say something about it.

238
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:45,440
Then you should want to say something.

239
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:45,920
Yeah.

240
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,639
Oh, the suicide note, thank you, is on 372.

241
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,440
Let me write that down.

242
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,599
So next time I do this, I won't be stuck there.

243
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,559
Right now, two what is it again?

244
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:10,279
672?

245
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:11,799
672.

246
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:27,160
Okay, it says, it says, yeah, there it is, this sort of minimal note here, 72, where he says, I destroy myself of my own will and inclination so as to throw no blame on anybody.

247
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:34,520
And then the prosecutor says what I think is important to say, what would it have cost him to add, I am the murderer, not Dmitri Karamatsov.

248
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:36,440
But that did not add.

249
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:43,320
And so the idea is nobody could believe that Smershikov was the killer.

250
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:43,799
Yeah.

251
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:07,880
Well, that's interesting.

252
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:18,519
Let's stop with what she's saying for a minute before we go to you, because she's raising, I mean, what in the world motivates Smershikov to do it since he has no motivations outside of Yvonne?

253
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,160
I had this, I don't think that, I don't know the answer to that really.

254
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,719
And maybe just a kind of glitch in the book.

255
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:38,039
But if there's any kind of answer, it's something like he's motivated simply by the negative kind of motivation that he's disconnected from Yvonne and he wants to revenge that.

256
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:41,479
That's not a new motivation, you know, not a positive motivation.

257
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:43,319
You all have things to say about that.

258
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:46,440
Okay, before the first hand I saw was over here somewhere.

259
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,839
Well, I guess you have next.

260
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,959
I could put you on hold.

261
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,839
Go ahead.

262
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:21,440
You're right.

263
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,039
There's this funny parallel.

264
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,760
You're not drawing any sort of existential conclusions.

265
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:26,640
No, neither am I.

266
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,040
Good.

267
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,039
It's just a kind of funny symmetry.

268
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,400
Got you.

269
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:35,120
Before you, somebody else had a hand up over here, which I have now lost.

270
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,599
Who who uh yeah, go ahead.

271
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:00,559
But now I'll explain to the problem.

272
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,040
That's right.

273
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:09,839
That's good.

274
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,200
Well, oh, well, I see, but I don't agree, I think, quite.

275
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,040
I mean, he does try to get Yvonne to kill him, and he doesn't, won't.

276
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,799
We'll read about that in a minute.

277
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,800
But it he doesn't have to kill himself.

278
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,400
He'll just go, he'll die anyway.

279
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,479
He's he's not himself, he's sick, he's weak and falling apart.

280
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:33,200
And the the idea that he does kill himself is some strange design, remember?

281
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:42,600
And so we're given that hint that he's got some, he's really upset with Yvonne, and he's so upset with Yvonne that he's got some weird plan.

282
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,039
I read you that sentence.

283
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:47,880
And that seems to be something more than just inevitable suicide.

284
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:52,119
Paul doesn't have a self.

285
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,999
How is it that you are?

286
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,799
Well, he doesn't have much emotions, does he?

287
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:07,399
I mean, he's he's except this emotion, I guess it's a funny emotion, of as she says, he's a parasite, he's been disconnected from the host.

288
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:17,319
He's got this kind of desperate attempt, first attempt to hold on to Yvonne and then desperate anger at Yvonne.

289
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:18,440
Why does he have that?

290
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:25,160
Well, when you say he doesn't have a self, it doesn't mean that he doesn't have consciousness and maybe even emotions of sorts.

291
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,400
He just doesn't have a dark side and a bright side, and that's sure.

292
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:37,640
I mean, the main emotions he has are nasty emotions like putting pins in the dogs and killing the cats and so forth.

293
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:44,039
But those are, whatever they are, they're not human emotions, I think the argument is supposed to be, yeah.

294
00:23:51,799 --> 00:24:09,559
And I think, wait, I think I did this in the wrong order, and I don't mind, because but I think before we discuss it, we should look at a few passages in the third interview, which I jumped over because I got because I got off on that why does what is the strange design.

295
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:15,319
And so let's go back to 593.

296
00:24:15,959 --> 00:24:19,039
Let me get just get back to where I want to be.

297
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:23,920
Not there.

298
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,479
593.

299
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,519
Okay, that's the strange design.

300
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:35,519
So now here we go.

301
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:44,959
All of this now has got to do for a little while with how does Smerzhikov relate to Yvonne after this has all become clear.

302
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:48,479
And that starts on 597.

303
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:57,200
And the first thing is this evidence that without Yvonne, Smerzhikov has no desires of importance.

304
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,239
Because Smerzhikov lifted the book off the notes, the bank notes, and laid them to the side.

305
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:03,920
Take that money with you, Smerzikov.

306
00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:05,279
Of course I'll take it.

307
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,479
Why do you give it to me if you committed the murder for the sake of it?

308
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:10,719
Yvonne looked at him with great surprise.

309
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,160
I don't want it, Smerzhikov said in a shaking voice.

310
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,799
I did have an idea of beginning a new life with that money in Moscow, or better still abroad.

311
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,879
I did dream of it, chiefly because all things are lawful.

312
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:30,799
So now Smerzhikov has lost that motive because that was if the crime was not really a crime.

313
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:38,400
And so taking the money was something Yvonne approved of and wanted him to do and murder and so forth.

314
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:47,680
Then he had, again, a kind of parasitical desire, because Yvonne says way early on in the book, I want to go to Europe and so forth.

315
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:51,680
So he wants to go to Europe and live abroad.

316
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,639
And then now comes this funny conversation.

317
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,240
Let me read more.

318
00:25:58,239 --> 00:26:01,999
That was right what you taught me, or you talked a lot to me about that.

319
00:26:01,999 --> 00:26:06,839
Or if there's no everlasting God, there's no such thing as virtue and there's no need of it, you were right.

320
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:08,120
But that's how I looked at it.

321
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,440
Did you come to that conclusion by yourself?

322
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,880
asked Yvonne with a smile.

323
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,160
With your help.

324
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,440
And now I suppose you believe in God since you're giving back the money.

325
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:22,039
Listen, what these critics who care about that sayings of Isaac the Syrian should notice.

326
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,239
No, I don't believe in God, whispered Smerzhikov.

327
00:26:25,239 --> 00:26:27,160
That's why I'm getting it back.

328
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,440
Now, why is that?

329
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,759
Well, because I think Yvonne is his God.

330
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:32,999
And now Yvonne has repudiated him.

331
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:34,360
He has no reason to go.

332
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,160
No, no, he can't go to Europe anymore.

333
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,920
He doesn't want anything anymore.

334
00:26:39,719 --> 00:26:40,359
Yes.

335
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,759
No, I don't believe in God, whispers Smerzikov.

336
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:44,200
Then why are you giving it back?

337
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,959
And I think the answer would be because you were my God and you repudiated me.

338
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:49,319
But he just says, stop, that's enough.

339
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,759
Smershikov waved his hand.

340
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:54,680
You used to say that everything is lawful, and now you're so upset.

341
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:01,239
And okay, that's the beginning of why he's so upset at Yvonne.

342
00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:06,039
He's carried out Yvonne's wishes as he understood them and rightly understood them.

343
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:11,879
And now he followed Yvonne's philosophy as he understood it and rightly understood it.

344
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:17,079
So he ought to be thanked and congratulated and take the money and go off to France.

345
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:27,799
But then, and it's that Smerzhikov has lost everything, lost his God, lost his motives.

346
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:30,759
So now he wants to die by 590.

347
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:33,239
There's nothing to live for anymore.

348
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:39,320
And he says at the top of 598, well, kill me, kill me now, Smerzhikov said all at once, looking strangely at Yvonne.

349
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:41,479
You won't even dare do that, he said with a bitter smile.

350
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:44,680
You won't dare do anything, you who used to be so bold.

351
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:50,959
Okay, so that's that's his final angry thing.

352
00:27:51,600 --> 00:28:04,160
So since Yvonne won't kill him, he kills us himself, but he does it so that he can get revenge on Yvonne.

353
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,000
I mean, that must be the strange design.

354
00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:08,079
At least that's how I'm reading it.

355
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,360
But I'm not sure.

356
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,119
Then comes the suicide, where he doesn't take the blame.

357
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,200
He doesn't do it out of jail.

358
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:25,039
And so the idea is, I gather, to get, he's so angry at Yvonne, if angry is the right thing, I guess you can have that emotion.

359
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,400
He's so angry at Yvonne for having repudiated him.

360
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:41,119
You see, for giving him the motive to do it, giving him the right to do it, making it look like he will, that Igoban, who is kind of his God, will be so pleased if he does it, and then recoil.

361
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:52,799
And then Yvonne recoils in horror, says he didn't want him to do it, seems to repudiate his philosophy that all things are lawful, and leaves Smershikov nowhere.

362
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,559
And so that's why I said, like a God that failed.

363
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:03,519
The God that asked him to do all these things turns out not to support him and not really to want him to do all these things.

364
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:03,920
Yeah.

365
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,880
Well, that is a problem.

366
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,400
How do you deal with it?

367
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,400
Yeah.

368
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,079
Yeah, let's see.

369
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,519
It's right here somewhere.

370
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:24,559
But anyway, that's right.

371
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,319
Oh, no, I did it for violence.

372
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,040
I've got nobody to blame but myself.

373
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:28,519
Yeah.

374
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:03,400
The only problem with that is that it doesn't explain the strange design that he seems to have.

375
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,639
And it doesn't fit with Alyasha's prayer that says now this Mezhikov has killed himself.

376
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,080
No one will believe Yvonne.

377
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:14,920
So I mean, I stick to my reading, though I'm open to things like what you just said.

378
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,839
Some ingenious better reading may still be lurking around the corner.

379
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,400
Yeah.

380
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,120
When you reach 30.

381
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:28,999
Yeah.

382
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:33,160
And he's, but I don't know if Mezhikov knows it.

383
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:41,799
And again, remember, you guys are coming up with ingenious things, but there is the phrase that he's got some strange design, and it isn't a design to imitate.

384
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:46,039
Well, it could be, imitate Yvonne, what Yvonne is going to do at 30, only do it early.

385
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:46,840
How old are they now?

386
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,839
About 24 or something, I think.

387
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,240
I'm not convinced.

388
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:51,799
Yeah.

389
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,120
It wasn't that I didn't understand you, I couldn't hear you.

390
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,479
Talk louder.

391
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:21,040
I don't know.

392
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,639
Did you all hear her?

393
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:23,600
Yes.

394
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,079
Tell me, well, either you talk louder or somebody will have to repeat it.

395
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,200
So say it again.

396
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,319
Louder.

397
00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:32,959
But here and there, but I can't tell you which, so say it again.

398
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,400
Okay, now so Smerdyakov, I say this for the pod people anyway.

399
00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:47,680
Okay, okay, the justice with, you think that it's justice with no mercy, Smershikov.

400
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,239
Okay.

401
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,639
Done.

402
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:54,959
Yvonne was his God and what?

403
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,479
His Christ figure.

404
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,600
Why, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

405
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,719
Why, why?

406
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:09,280
You know, I'm sure.

407
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,359
But why just go out and sell him?

408
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,559
Why am I going to tell him about him?

409
00:32:16,879 --> 00:32:18,560
His Savior has rejected him.

410
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:22,480
Well, now that I've heard you, I still don't believe you.

411
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:22,959
Okay.

412
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,239
I mean, that's just, I mean, two.

413
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:39,840
I mean, when you start putting Smershikov in the place of Jesus as, I mean, Yvonne, in the place of Jesus, as somebody who should be saving Smershikov at his way, that is the thing Smershikov is thinking.

414
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:48,719
But Yvonne is similar, but I think, I just disagree.

415
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:51,519
I think nothing could possibly save Smershikov.

416
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,640
One, two things.

417
00:32:52,640 --> 00:33:03,879
One, he doesn't even want to be saved in this, except he's given, maybe this is what you mean, he could save him by giving him motives and keeping him attached to things by imitating Yvonne.

418
00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:05,400
That's what he did for him.

419
00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:07,160
And that is the sense in which he saved him.

420
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:09,079
I'm sort of getting on into what you're saying.

421
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:16,039
And so at the gate, for instance, he's saying, in effect, I'm going to do whatever you want me to do.

422
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:21,000
I have no desires of my own, but as long as you're telling me what to do, I'm happy to do it.

423
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,719
That's, in a sense, the way Yvonne is his savior and is saving him.

424
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:28,120
And then Yvonne stops telling him what to do.

425
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,960
He says, I didn't want you to do that.

426
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,880
I'm horrified at what you've done.

427
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:37,400
I don't, and then his savior has abandoned him, and he's upset.

428
00:33:37,399 --> 00:33:40,120
But more than upset, and we're just back to that again.

429
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,640
He's got this plan.

430
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:56,759
Now, how he can even be feeling a need for revenge, I don't know, except by saying it's not any positive motive that, like, anything that he wants to go after, like cooking or Paris or money, or not men or women, but it might have been.

431
00:33:56,759 --> 00:34:05,239
I mean, no motives at all, just the motive to get to get revenge on Yvonne for not giving him any motives.

432
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:07,879
That's peculiar, and I don't know what to do about it.

433
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:08,680
Yeah.

434
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:17,719
I'm glad he didn't even want any thought and a bit of thought, defensive, and friendly.

435
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:24,520
And by the volume, I just called it very long, I heard something else responded.

436
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:34,120
But so far, I have been this area for exciting by finding something back.

437
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,400
But actually, he's a good size.

438
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:47,399
He gets their thoughts, they're always outside of the turnbuckle or whatever, but also in a way holding some part of that.

439
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,600
Holding him apart from this circle.

440
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:01,759
Yeah, well, okay, well, you added one important, interesting element, but I don't quite know what to do with it.

441
00:35:01,759 --> 00:35:02,879
But I think you're right.

442
00:35:02,879 --> 00:35:03,919
It's something to think about.

443
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,839
It's interesting you remember that.

444
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,439
Yes, Gregory read that book.

445
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,120
That's where Smershikov got it.

446
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:15,120
And it's this dark book that Gregory read when he was in a dark mood when their child died.

447
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,000
And Smershikov has been reading it.

448
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,840
And he put the money on it.

449
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,480
But I don't know how to make anything more of that.

450
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:25,120
And if you do, you come and talk to me.

451
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,560
That's because then it bought me a huge idea.

452
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,039
But maybe, maybe.

453
00:35:41,759 --> 00:35:42,880
I don't know.

454
00:35:43,759 --> 00:35:44,719
Well, last comment.

455
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,279
Smerykov doesn't have a spell.

456
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:04,559
I understand about how not being able to love the sound of other things inside the earth.

457
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,159
Ah, that's easy.

458
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,839
The first one I don't know about not being able to love.

459
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,119
But he asks, how does he see?

460
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:21,040
Because that's the mysterious visitor stuff applied to Yvonne, and that's getting too tenuous.

461
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,280
But he does understand.

462
00:36:23,279 --> 00:36:25,039
He's smart, Smershikov.

463
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,120
He understands that Yvonne believes in justice.

464
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,839
I'm sure he's heard Yvonne talk about that.

465
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:39,639
Maybe the story about, you know, that he has to commit suicide because the world is a place where no just individual would want to live and so forth.

466
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:52,200
At least, he wouldn't understand it, you know, in the sense of directly understanding it, believing it, but he would accept it because it's Yvonne's view, and he knows, I suppose, that it's Yvonne's view.

467
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:59,000
Remember the phrase in that discussion, Yvonne says to Alyasha, I must have justice or I'll kill myself.

468
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:12,600
Now, Smershakov could hear that and understand that, though he couldn't understand it in the sense of understanding how anybody would want to do that or care about that, because he doesn't understand how anybody would want to do anything or care about anything.

469
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:20,040
But he could see that it would make Yvonne miserable to have Dmitry in prison and Yvonne running around in the world.

470
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,359
I don't think we should spend longer on it.

471
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:27,399
But if you have more to say about it, come and see me in office hours or write your paper.

472
00:37:27,399 --> 00:37:31,640
But I told you there are the loose ends, and that's one of the strange ones.

473
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:37,719
I think you can understand more about why I'm making such a fuss about this if I go a little further.

474
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:39,080
Let me see now.

475
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,759
What I want to talk about is something, one more thing we have time for today, anyway.

476
00:37:52,919 --> 00:38:04,360
The very basic Dostoevsky idea that nobody can commit a crime and just feel okay about it, get away with it.

477
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:19,679
And that's notice that Yvonne, in spite of his saying, for God, all things are possible, when it actually comes down to killing his father, even in the secondhand hiring somebody else to do his way, can't stand the idea that he did it.

478
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:30,479
And those of you who read Crime and Punishment, a lot of you know that Raskolnikov, who thinks he's above ethics because he's a superior person and kills the pawnbroker, can't get away with it.

479
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,880
He finally has to go to prison.

480
00:38:32,879 --> 00:38:39,920
And Dostoevsky would have loved a case that happened in California, or maybe, I don't know if you remember it or not.

481
00:38:40,879 --> 00:38:46,480
How old were you when the guy, I don't remember his name, killed Moscone?

482
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:54,719
Any of you that buy something his name, a former policeman, you don't remember the killers?

483
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:57,040
Went to City Hall and shot the mayor?

484
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,279
Yes, with the Twinkie Defense.

485
00:38:59,279 --> 00:39:00,160
What's the guy's name?

486
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,120
I don't remember.

487
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,919
That was White.

488
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:02,640
What White?

489
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,999
Dan White.

490
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,080
Dan White just walked into City Hall and shot the mayor, Moscone.

491
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,640
That's why the Moscone Center is named after him.

492
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,400
And got away with it.

493
00:39:12,879 --> 00:39:19,759
Got a very light sentence on this crazy defense that he had eaten too many Twinkies and he wasn't in his right mind.

494
00:39:19,759 --> 00:39:21,679
That's why it's called the Twinkie Defense.

495
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,560
And everybody was outraged, but he got off.

496
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,040
And two years later, he committed suicide.

497
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,039
Very Dostoevsky sort of thing.

498
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:37,359
Obviously, he couldn't live with himself and his neighbors and the world once he knew that he was the murderer of the cold-blooded murderer of the mayor.

499
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,719
So anyway, but Dostoevsky has a big general view.

500
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,280
And it looks, it's sort of like this.

501
00:39:43,279 --> 00:39:46,080
You could put it in kind of philosophical terms.

502
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,440
It's a kind of proof of the existence of God.

503
00:39:49,439 --> 00:39:52,880
That is, he's if, it's a kind of syllogism.

504
00:39:52,879 --> 00:39:59,120
If and only if God is dead, would all things be possible, or all things be lawful.

505
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:02,000
But all things aren't lawful.

506
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:14,520
Nobody can get away with murder and not be caught in the web of connectedness and finally suffer for it or have to kill themselves, be in the hands of a living God.

507
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:24,280
So it's so the universe is so set up that you can't break the chain of connectedness with impunity and just get away with it.

508
00:40:24,279 --> 00:40:41,080
And the chain of connectedness is God, remember, that whole prayer of Alyasha's that God is catching up with Yvonne, the Yvonne who thought that he could just wash his hands of everything and leave the world at 30 or leave the town and go to Moscow because he isn't involved.

509
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:47,000
That everybody is involved, and if you break the involvement, then you will suffer for it.

510
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,879
That's the prayer, remember, an important prayer on 619.

511
00:40:52,040 --> 00:41:03,320
I'm just mentioning it, but I'll show you, remember, that God in whom Yvonne disbelieved and his truth were gaining mastery over his hard heart, he refused to submit.

512
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:06,119
That means God is the connectedness.

513
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,640
That's the truth.

514
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,600
Nobody can break the connectedness and get away with it.

515
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,519
That would prove that there was a God.

516
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,439
That would prove that there was connectedness.

517
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:21,000
If it was true, that everybody who was a human being couldn't, no one could commit the crime and get away with it.

518
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:28,680
One, the most damaging thing you could do is make a movie like Woody Allen's Crimes and Misdemeanors, which I keep talking about.

519
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:30,680
Get it on DVD and watch it.

520
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:35,879
I mean, this guy actually takes, so to speak, takes back Dostoevsky.

521
00:41:35,879 --> 00:41:39,080
I'm sure that's what Woody Allen had in mind.

522
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:53,039
He commits, he hires a hitman, gets his mistress murdered, begins to feel that he has to confess, practically breaks down and goes to the police to confess, like Rostolnikov, and then decides, well, why should I confess?

523
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,160
Nobody knows.

524
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,280
And he doesn't, and he lives happily ever after.

525
00:41:57,279 --> 00:42:01,039
Now, that is exactly what Dostoevsky thinks is impossible.

526
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,040
That would show that God is dead.

527
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,280
I mean, if you could do that.

528
00:42:05,279 --> 00:42:06,319
And maybe you can.

529
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:09,039
I mean, I think Woody Allen has got an interesting point there.

530
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,560
He makes this very plausible.

531
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,519
I mean, it's a question of whether you can make such a life plausible.

532
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,479
Dan White is on Dostoevsky's side.

533
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:24,079
He commits suicide, but the guy, the hero of the leader, don't die in crimes and misdemeanors is on the other side.

534
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,200
Yeah, yeah.

535
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,200
No, I gather it's a similar story.

536
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,999
I've got to see Matchpoint because, yes, how many have seen that poem?

537
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,799
A lot of you.

538
00:42:34,799 --> 00:42:35,919
Oh, I've got to connect up.

539
00:42:35,919 --> 00:42:38,960
Or you want to tell me, is it just like the story I told?

540
00:42:39,279 --> 00:42:40,239
Very similar.

541
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:48,400
So Dostoevsky, Woody Allen and Dostoevsky are on a head-on collision, and he's doing it twice, taking on this thing.

542
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:52,719
But it looks like that, but then, so much for that.

543
00:42:52,879 --> 00:42:58,080
Now the question is, I want to come back for a minute to what we've just been talking about before.

544
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,560
But Dostoevsky's got a problem.

545
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:06,800
How does anybody ever commit a murder and get away with it?

546
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,959
How could they?

547
00:43:09,919 --> 00:43:14,800
And the answer is, one answer would be that they haven't got any self.

548
00:43:14,799 --> 00:43:32,640
That the only person who could commit a murder with impunity would be somebody who had no understanding of the connectedness whatsoever and was acting on somebody else's orders because he was a kind of totally parasitical on them.

549
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,200
In other words, Smerzhikov.

550
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:37,000
Smerzhikov, he can commit a murder.

551
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,920
And he doesn't have to commit suicide because he committed a murder.

552
00:43:40,919 --> 00:43:46,039
He commits suicide for an entirely different reason because he's lost touch with Ivan.

553
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:55,800
But I think Dostoevsky has to set it up so that nobody commits a murder in any Dostoevsky book gets away with it.

554
00:43:56,919 --> 00:44:02,360
But there are killings in Dostoevsky books, and they're always based on misunderstanding, like this one.

555
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:13,480
In the possessed, lots of people get killed because they totally misunderstand the Smerzhikov-like character who's at the center of the possessed.

556
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:20,759
And in the end, well, and that person isn't even a person, and they're a kind of vacuum.

557
00:44:20,919 --> 00:44:22,759
They end up wasting away.

558
00:44:22,759 --> 00:44:24,999
So anyway, this is a kind of Dostoevsky picture.

559
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,439
You can either believe it or not.

560
00:44:26,439 --> 00:44:29,879
But I mean, it's surely something Dostoevsky believes.

561
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:41,400
So now, I just want to look at.

562
00:44:41,399 --> 00:44:42,439
Okay, I've done that.

563
00:44:42,439 --> 00:44:44,360
I'm just seeing where I am.

564
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,080
Okay, somebody, did I see a hand?

565
00:44:57,719 --> 00:44:59,319
Well, we've got ten minutes.

566
00:44:59,319 --> 00:44:59,959
I'm going on.

567
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:02,840
There's plenty we should talk about.

568
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,920
So where are we?

569
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,879
Oh, yeah, I owe you an explanation.

570
00:45:11,879 --> 00:45:14,520
I just found it, and I needed to tell you at some point.

571
00:45:14,839 --> 00:45:22,479
Now it looks like we don't know whether Yvonne is going to live or die.

572
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,359
Let's just do that before time is done.

573
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,520
I've got to find it.

574
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:42,160
Okay, so Yvonne's position is unlivable.

575
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,479
And where now?

576
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,400
I don't even know where is Yvonne at the trial.

577
00:45:48,399 --> 00:45:49,999
Well, I read that art, didn't I?

578
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,960
Where he asked for water and he looks like he's dying.

579
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,800
Okay, so we've got that.

580
00:45:54,799 --> 00:45:56,399
So I, oh, but I didn't cry.

581
00:45:56,399 --> 00:45:57,120
Now I remember.

582
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,519
I said that someplace we have evidence.

583
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,519
You see, this is not a deep existential point.

584
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:06,320
This is just something that I promised that I would use this time to do.

585
00:46:06,879 --> 00:46:10,880
The promise was that we know that Yvonne is going to live.

586
00:46:10,879 --> 00:46:25,680
And that means that somehow, we don't know how, he's going to have to suffer for his crime and expiate it and get back in touch with people in spite of the fact that Smerzhikov suicide.

587
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,200
Maybe that connected to the mysterious visitor, it occurred to me.

588
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:35,920
They don't have to believe Yvonne, as long as Yvonne has suffered and become a good person.

589
00:46:36,399 --> 00:46:48,080
So Smerjakov doesn't get away with this trick, if that's what he's pulling, that Yvonne is now stuck for the rest of his life, knowing that he's a murderer and knowing that he can't tell anybody because they won't believe him.

590
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:53,120
Somehow, somebody, probably Alegashi, gets Yvonne to suffer the right way.

591
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,200
All we know is the following.

592
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:07,559
That when he goes and stands on the stairs, which remember I read today because it comes back at the end of the book, as the most disgusting thing he ever did in his life, but the first time it happens, it happens.

593
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,759
I mean, it really happens, is on 267.

594
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:24,280
So, remembering the night long afterwards, Ivan recalled with peculiar repulsion how he had got up and gone out and listened to his father stirring round, now skipping down a third.

595
00:47:24,279 --> 00:47:28,200
That action, all his life afterwards, he called infamous.

596
00:47:28,359 --> 00:47:33,560
At the bottom of his heart, he thought that it was the basis action of his life.

597
00:47:33,799 --> 00:47:34,919
And that's it.

598
00:47:34,919 --> 00:47:40,919
So, all his life afterward, and that he understood it as base.

599
00:47:41,239 --> 00:47:46,200
That action was his total detached listening to his father.

600
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:54,520
And he felt no hatred for his father, but simple curiosity to know why he was walking around down there below and what he was doing.

601
00:47:54,520 --> 00:48:09,559
Now, once you know that later, you know that he, Yvonne, also knew that thanks to Smerzyakov and Dmitry, as he thought about it then, this was his last night, because Ivan was just on his way to Moscow.

602
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,559
Smeryakov was going to sham a pit.

603
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,999
Dmitry was going to kill him.

604
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:24,920
So Ivan was listening like a detached spectator, like an eyewitness, outside the world to old Karamatsov, completely indifferent to whether he's going to be killed or not.

605
00:48:24,919 --> 00:48:28,360
And that is the worst thing he ever did.

606
00:48:28,359 --> 00:48:31,159
And somehow or other, he suffers for it.

607
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:45,319
I don't know how, because all his life long, though he had a long life, presumably, he remembers it, rightly he remembers it, as the most disgusting thing he ever did.

608
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:46,599
Namely, why?

609
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,200
Not accept the connectedness.

610
00:48:50,239 --> 00:49:01,840
He's just related to old Taramatsov, like a curious bystander related to an interesting incident, and that's what he has to suffer for and realize you can't do that.

611
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,560
You've got to accept the connection.

612
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,640
Okay, now maybe I should stop.

613
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:11,759
I have to look and see if we should go on to the next.

614
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,120
Yeah, it's okay.

615
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:20,559
What we've got for next time, and you should definitely read it because it's just terribly important.

616
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:28,400
Now, now it's not important anymore for who did it, but it's absolutely crucial for every important question that's left open.

617
00:49:28,399 --> 00:49:30,880
Let me just tell you that, and then you can go.

618
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:38,320
Remember that there are several unopened questions, unanswered questions.

619
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,799
We don't understand what it is to found a church.

620
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:45,840
The whole issue of community left over from the Grand Inquisitor is still open.

621
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:55,759
We don't know whether the church should be one individual in isolation or a universal ante, and neither one sounds right.

622
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:58,160
Well, is there a way to existentialize the church?

623
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:12,239
I'm going to tell you the question you should have in mind when you read the last chapter before the afterlog, the part about Alicia's, what happens at Alicia's stone, on page start on 722.

624
00:50:12,399 --> 00:50:16,000
Here are the questions you need to keep in mind: What is the church?

625
00:50:16,879 --> 00:50:20,719
Is there such a thing as immortality and eternity?

626
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,719
What's the true meaning of being a Taramatsov?

627
