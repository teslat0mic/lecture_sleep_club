00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
As you have been trying to read it, you discover how hard it is.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:17,279
One of the ways it's hard that I forgot to mention, besides the ones I did, it being a sort of secret message and very original and not like anything ever before in philosophy and so forth.

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,920
It does take up a lot of Hegel jargon, which I have to explain, like lower immediacy and mediation.

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,719
And I'll explain that as we go.

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,760
And I've been asked whether there are any good books about fear and trembling.

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,599
And there aren't, as far as I know.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,039
There may be some one somewhere that I don't know about.

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:42,760
But there is what would be one good book if the woman who wrote it hadn't been, isn't so shy about publishing it.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:57,000
A former student in this course who then became a GSI in this course and finally wrote her thesis on Kierkegaard and then became a professor here, assistant, an instructor here, and taught a Kierkegaard course.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,560
Her thesis is the best thing on Kierkegaard.

11
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,920
So I wouldn't be telling you this if it wasn't that I'm going to put it on reserve for Philosophy 7.

12
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,440
I think it's more important for you to read Kierkegaard over and over.

13
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:18,680
But if you want to know where Fear and Trembling fits in all the writing of Kierkegaard and what the whole system is in which it's a piece, then that's the book to read.

14
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,959
It's called Too Much of Nothing by Jane Rubin.

15
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,160
And it's not a book.

16
00:01:23,639 --> 00:01:25,159
It's a big fat thing.

17
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:27,560
It's her PhD thesis.

18
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,680
Okay, now I think we can go on.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,880
In spite of Jane and her thesis, there's still plenty of room for understanding this book, plenty of problems that I haven't figured out yet.

20
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,400
And every year somebody makes some progress in making it all fit together.

21
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:58,920
Kierkegaard is trying this crazy thing of trying to make his secret story with Regina and the Western experience, the whole Western philosophical attempt to deal with romantic, to invent and then deal with romantic love.

22
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:06,920
And finally, let's see, the third thing, and the Abraham Isaac story, that's what really messes things up, all fit together.

23
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:11,000
And it's amazing how far he gets, but they don't quite fit together.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,440
And that's a problem.

25
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:15,080
And I will try to fit them together as I see it.

26
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,200
And I'm ready to be told that there are better ways.

27
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:43,360
But now, as I said, and I just was talking about this at the end last time, when you teach an existentialist book, you've got to look for the defining experience, the revelation that the author has and is trying to get you to see and be open to experiencing and seeing the world the way it looks once you have this experience.

28
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,480
That's what we're going to plunge into today.

29
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:50,800
There's one other thing, however, just before I do it, just to remember it again.

30
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:54,159
There's one thing I wish I had said earlier, but I better say it now.

31
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,440
It's better to say it now, even though it's not quite where it fits.

32
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:13,040
Another feature of these existential writers is they've got an extremely moral picture of what the good life is and what people should be doing and what people shouldn't be doing, but they don't have an ethical code.

33
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:22,800
They don't try to give you any ethical principles, and they don't try to give you any arguments for their ethical position, their view about what the good life is.

34
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:31,840
Instead, starting with Pascal already, they describe various sorts of lives and how they will work out.

35
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:42,160
And they argue that only the one that they're promoting will make you have a joyful and meaningful life, and all the others will lead to despair.

36
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:50,240
So Kierkegaard's got a lot to say about the despair for the night of resignation, as you will see, have seen already.

37
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,320
And he's got a lot to say about the bliss of the night of faith.

38
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,039
He wants to show you those in his description.

39
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:01,200
And the idea that a wrong way to live is a way that leads to despair.

40
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,400
Dostoevsky also is very clear about that.

41
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:11,160
There's one character in the brothers who is like a philosopher and who ends in despair.

42
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:19,480
But that's a way of arguing that this philosophical view of human beings and how they should live, if you really try to live it, doesn't work.

43
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,159
So just keep that in the back of your mind as you read.

44
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:44,360
Try to figure out not only what the revealing experience is, but which experience, which way of looking at the world the writer thinks will lead you to bliss and meaning and fulfillment and so forth, joy in Dostoevsky language, bliss in Kierkegaard language, and which ones will lead you to despair.

45
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:52,120
Okay, now I'm back to the, and here we go, back to the example on page 70 where I was at the end last time.

46
00:04:52,120 --> 00:05:00,680
It's about the lad who falls in love with the princess, and that's the most important thing.

47
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:08,760
And there's a kind of mistranslation here I didn't mention last time, but I think I should.

48
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:12,360
It goes by so fast you probably correct it without noticing.

49
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,360
A young lad falls in love with a princess, and the content of his whole life lies in this love.

50
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:20,200
I think it ought to be.

51
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,240
And the what is it now?

52
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,200
Let's see.

53
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,200
Not the content of his whole life.

54
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,560
The whole content of his life is what it really is trying.

55
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:33,240
The whole content of his life lies in love.

56
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,520
That's the earlier.

57
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:36,120
I mean, I don't read Danish very well.

58
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:44,200
I try sometimes, but I know that the previous translation sometimes gets things clearer than this one.

59
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,920
And that's one of the little places where it happens.

60
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,200
There's another one coming up soon.

61
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,800
I'll tell you about it in a minute.

62
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:56,159
So here we've got this example of what I called last time an unconditional commitment.

63
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,720
But this time I want to put it more in context.

64
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,559
Last time I was just rushing to tell you enough so that you could find your way around.

65
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:05,920
How many feel that they found their way around somewhat in reading it?

66
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,880
How many felt completely lost as if they were in total alien territory?

67
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:18,559
Well, maybe, I mean, either, who knows whether it's a question of honesty or what, but I don't get much of an answer.

68
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:23,040
Well, but by the end of today, I think you won't feel so alien territory.

69
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,440
Let's start sort of where you are.

70
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:45,279
That is, Kierkegaard writing in his journals when he was 22, pretty much your age, and what he was looking for for his life, because that's what happens when he, that's why he went after Regino with such total craziness.

71
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:59,040
But anyway, here's what he says: What I really lack is to be clear in my mind what I am to do, underlines, not what I am to know, except insofar as a certain understanding must precede action.

72
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:05,680
The thing is to understand myself, to see what God really wishes me to do.

73
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:14,160
The thing is to find a truth that is true for me, to find, again, underline, the idea for which I can live and die.

74
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:20,480
That is, you know, this is what I call an unconditional commitment that gives you an identity.

75
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:26,480
And then he remembers romantic love with the lad and the princess is one example.

76
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:37,400
But remember, on the next page in the footnote, any other interest in whatever, in which an individual concentrates the whole of life's reality, would be this.

77
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:45,880
Just to comment on this, when he says he wants to know what God wishes me to do, that's interesting.

78
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:53,880
In the old days, people had a calling or a vocation that literally means what God was calling them to do.

79
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,400
Sometimes to be a monk or a nun, but other things too.

80
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:03,160
So the vocation and calling are just the same word in different languages, so to speak.

81
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:13,000
And there's still sort of an idea in the background of Kierkegaard that there is this calling.

82
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:34,760
He doesn't really believe anymore in an individual God actually sending a message, but he does believe that there is this experience in which this absolute authority, there isn't any person there, but something calls you, or you get a calling.

83
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,880
It's the only way to put it there.

84
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,399
Something is too much again.

85
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:42,680
He's trying to keep this creator, God the Father, out of his story.

86
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,520
I'll tell you all, just jumping ahead, just so you won't think I'm crazy.

87
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:59,639
He says in another book of his, once Jesus comes, that you've got to relate to Jesus, the God-man, he cuts off access to the God the Father.

88
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:03,479
And that's because what all these people were reading have in common.

89
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:18,360
Remember, they think in various ways that something you have to purge this of the philosophical baggage that comes from Plato of thinking that there is some super supreme being, in which a term stands.

90
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,559
So there's no supreme being doing the calling.

91
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,519
What Kierkegaard is asking in this is: what's his calling?

92
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:36,480
That is, what does some what has absolute authority in his life and tells him who he is and what to do?

93
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,120
And that is this unconditional commitment.

94
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,160
And it's something that you could live or die for.

95
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,560
It's, as he says, it's not an idea that you could live or die for.

96
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:54,160
He's writing at 22 in his journals, and that's pretty young and pretty, he isn't quite clear about that.

97
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,639
You don't live and die for an idea.

98
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,480
Nobody should do that.

99
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,639
Galileo wouldn't do that.

100
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,960
You can only live and die for some particular person or particular cause.

101
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:17,360
And he knows that later and sees that the idea, he wouldn't say anymore that you could live and die for an idea.

102
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,960
That's too abstract.

103
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,919
Okay, but the basic idea is there.

104
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:31,039
He wants to find out who he is, and to find out who he is, he has to find out what his own individual commitment is.

105
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:39,919
And when he does, the first thing you have to realize is it can't be just a strong feeling.

106
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:47,039
A strong feeling, to put it in the love kind of terms, would be an infatuation.

107
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:49,039
It wouldn't define who you were.

108
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:52,559
It would just be maybe the most exciting thing in your world.

109
00:10:52,559 --> 00:11:00,639
But the real unconditional commitment defines who you are and what counts in your world.

110
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,559
So you're going to get rid of this strong feeling.

111
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:09,399
That is on 71, and then about five lines down.

112
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:22,600
Once the lad has got this call from the princess, which gives him the whole content of his life, he has to make sure that he's just not being swept away by some emotion.

113
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:25,720
And that's about seven lines down on 71.

114
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:34,279
He first makes sure that this really is the content of his life, and his soul is too healthy and proud to squander the least thing on getting drunk.

115
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,639
Well, clunk, clunk.

116
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,640
That can't be right, getting drunk.

117
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:43,880
What the other translation says, and I'm sure it's much better, on an intoxication.

118
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:54,119
And what I take it, that really means something like a word.

119
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,639
Well, I think I even said it a minute ago.

120
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,919
Not love.

121
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:00,679
Oh, infatuation, yeah.

122
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,240
In the love story, it's infatuation.

123
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,519
In a more general sense, it's some big emotional experience.

124
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,519
It's got nothing to do with getting drunk.

125
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:13,799
Although you can see why the same word might get in there.

126
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:28,920
And then the first point I want to make is: so Kierkegaard is against the idea that you can stand up against philosophy and rationality in the name of some strong irrational feeling.

127
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,279
That's what the Romantics did, the German Romantics in the 1800s.

128
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:49,640
And that's to relapse into the sort of childish kind of overpowering emotions that people have and out and grow, according to Kierkegaard.

129
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,519
This is important because Kierkegaard thought the Greek philosophers were right.

130
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:02,079
We should get over our infatuations and moods and superstitions and wild passions and all that.

131
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:10,400
And the name for them that he uses is the first bit of Kierkegaard jargon that you're going to, I'm sorry, Hegel jargon you're going to have to get used to.

132
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,240
Let me try to do this right for a change.

133
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,760
Lower immediacy.

134
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:31,679
Oh, I'm printing it much too little, and I got blamed for that in the email.

135
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,359
Let me try again.

136
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,959
Lower immediacy is Hegel jargon.

137
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,000
Did I spell it right?

138
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,959
You're looking unhappy.

139
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,399
What did I do?

140
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:54,319
Me, immediately.

141
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,319
Ah, that's it.

142
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:01,279
You're supposed to tell me when I do that.

143
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,679
I had a hunch there was something.

144
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,799
There we go.

145
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:07,680
Okay.

146
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:18,720
So, lower immediacy is feeling, impulse, and it's why I call it immediacy.

147
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm trying to really give you a real quick course, in Hegel by going, by doing what I think nobody does in a course in Hegel, trying to get you to understand why he uses such weird language.

148
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,439
What's immediate about it?

149
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:39,079
It isn't sort of like, run and get me a Coke immediately, but it's something supposed to be what you start off with right off.

150
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,480
So kids have it when they're yelling for things.

151
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,519
It's something that comes over you right now.

152
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,200
That's another way to think about it.

153
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,559
It's spontaneous.

154
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:51,799
It hits you without reflection.

155
00:14:51,799 --> 00:15:01,400
Now, it's not that there's something absolutely bad about it, but to become a grown-up, you've got to get control of that.

156
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:12,279
You've got to be critical, get rid of your superstitions, not let your passions drive you around and get constantly hurt in infatuations and so forth.

157
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,960
And how do you get rid of it?

158
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:37,399
Well, by critical reflecting, by thinking about it, by seeing that your superstitions, say your racial prejudices and stereotypes don't fit reality, or seeing that when you go into one of these subjective states of wild egotistical desires, bad things happen and so forth.

159
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:51,559
And so Kierkegaard thinks that philosophy, Hegel, sorry, Socrates and Plato, were on the right track, thinking that philosophical detached reflection is very important.

160
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:54,839
And he calls that mediation.

161
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:56,439
That's a harder one to explain.

162
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,279
It took me years to figure out.

163
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,799
Explain that.

164
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:10,920
I see now already that I regret not writing lower immediacy at the bottom and mediation higher up.

165
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,199
These are getting better and better.

166
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:28,879
There's still something to be the immediacy.

167
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,720
We're going to need that.

168
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,159
Okay, now blackboards are not my favorite things around you.

169
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:46,240
So I finally found where in ordinary English do you have anything like a sense of what Hegel means by mediation?

170
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:49,360
Well, and it's sort of something philosophical.

171
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:50,160
What could it be?

172
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,880
Well, I finally decided it's labor mediation.

173
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,599
We do have a word for that.

174
00:16:55,599 --> 00:17:00,799
You know, the labor unions and the management are meeting and what's that, and they've got a mediator and so forth.

175
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:01,919
What does that mean?

176
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:14,319
Well, it means, at least I'm going to make it mean, somebody who helps them reflect and figure out what they really want, not just what they demand and desire right off and get all worked up about.

177
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:22,480
And if they do that right, they will become reasonable, articulate, and get realistic and be able to reach an understanding.

178
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,319
Mediation is understanding.

179
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,760
Lower immediacy is, you could say, undergone.

180
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,720
That is just getting driven around by it.

181
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:48,000
So, okay, it's good to have that kind of mediation.

182
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:50,399
Philosophers are right about that.

183
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,679
And it's not good to spend your life in infatuations and inebriations.

184
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:11,159
But Kierkegaard is proposing something not in Hegel's philosophy at all, something only possible within the Judeo-Christian tradition that hasn't been sort of undermined by the Greeks.

185
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,880
And that is that there could be something which he calls a higher immediacy.

186
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:19,559
That would make no sense to Hegel.

187
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:28,760
And I can't explain yet much about what it is, but you can already see what it's going to be.

188
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,599
I mean, it's, well, I will explain it.

189
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:34,919
Higher immediacy is his name for this defining commitment.

190
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,519
I haven't really explained defining.

191
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,240
Let's call it unconditional commitment.

192
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,480
But it's defining because it gives him an identity.

193
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,839
We'll come back to it.

194
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:49,000
So the unconditional commitment isn't just a strong feeling you have right off.

195
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,240
And it isn't a detached critical understanding either.

196
00:18:53,240 --> 00:19:00,359
It's something special that philosophers have no place for, and Hegel has no place for.

197
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:07,240
Hegel has something higher than mediation, and it's called, well, it's called the concept.

198
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:18,440
But it's not an abstract concept, but it's sort of the state where the philosophical truth is realized in the institutions of the society.

199
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,639
Don't worry about that.

200
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:23,000
Kierkegaard didn't care about the state at all.

201
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,960
That's a weakness.

202
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,039
I mean, he should have it in there somewhere.

203
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:32,839
But he thinks whatever the state and the institutions and the public meaning is, there's something higher than that.

204
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:37,159
And that is each individual finding their calling.

205
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:45,079
So he knocks out Hegel's third stage and puts in his third stage.

206
00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:10,240
I had this sort of question to make this clear, think of the difference between Martin Luther King's higher immediacy when he is unconditionally committed to justice now for the black people and ready to die for it.

207
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:18,880
And in that moving last speech, he as much as says he knows he's going to die for it, but he's been on the mountain, which means that's the higher immediacy.

208
00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:23,199
That's why, partly why it's a mountain, partly because he's seen the promised land.

209
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:30,640
But in any case, it's not like JFK saying, we're going to go to the moon in, what, 10 years?

210
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,199
I forget what he said, or five, something like that.

211
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,079
JFK is not going to be crushed.

212
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:44,319
He didn't, if it doesn't work, he does not put his identity as the man who decided we would go to the moon.

213
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,919
Or Bush now has decided we're going to go on a Mars walk.

214
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,120
But that's great.

215
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:54,399
That's going to make a lot of interesting work for lots of people.

216
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,119
But it's not an unconditional commitment.

217
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:09,279
Another word for this, by the way, is a philosopher named Paul Tillich, who you don't have to even write down, because he's sort of forgotten, that he did have a nice term, ultimate concern.

218
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:10,160
That was his.

219
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,720
He was borrowing a lot from Kierkegaard.

220
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,799
He was a Christian Protestant theologian.

221
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:23,599
So if that, if ultimate concern makes sense better than unconditional commitment, you can try that.

222
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,359
So it determines who you are.

223
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:33,039
And you can see on 72, and it's important.

224
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,480
Let me read a little bit of that last paragraph, but not the part about the knight yet.

225
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,799
Never mind the knight forgetting the whole thing.

226
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,039
We're already there in resignation.

227
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:45,799
But he says if he forgot the whole thing, what would that be like?

228
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:49,240
That would be like saying, well, it never really was very important.

229
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:53,559
It just seemed important, this commitment, whatever it was.

230
00:21:53,559 --> 00:22:03,079
But the knight, or anybody, does not contradict, well, the knight is somebody you'll see who stays in their unconditional commitment.

231
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:08,199
Then I think it's important I'm reading this because he says he doesn't contradict himself.

232
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,919
And it's a contradiction to forget the whole of one's life's content.

233
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:17,960
Again, I think the whole content of one's life and still be the same.

234
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:21,080
What I want to think about there is the contradiction.

235
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:27,399
You see, if you're defined, if you forget that you ever wanted to go to the moon, it's not a contradiction.

236
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,079
You just change your mind.

237
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:47,319
But if you forget and drop the fact that so-and-so that you have love for or some cause like Martin Luther King's that you're willing to die for, if you just say, well, it wasn't really important, you contradict yourself because that defines who you are.

238
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:53,399
And you can't stay the same person and just say, well, it wasn't really very important.

239
00:22:53,399 --> 00:22:53,960
Yeah.

240
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,000
Uh-oh, get ready.

241
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,519
You ready to go?

242
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,240
I've got to find some other person or individual or movement.

243
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:12,839
Well, the princess does not disturb them.

244
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,319
It is only lower than you forget about it.

245
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:22,160
While it's for very human beings, that seems like it're good question.

246
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:22,720
Go ahead.

247
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,480
I I heard it, that the people in the podcast didn't, but I'll say it, 'cause I heard it.

248
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:30,960
Why not?

249
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:31,760
Okay.

250
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:42,480
Isn't it strange that she's saying that on the very next page, I haven't seen it yet, but where okay.

251
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,760
Okay, the lower natures and so forth.

252
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,199
Is that where it is?

253
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:52,879
Ah, good.

254
00:23:52,879 --> 00:23:54,960
What the princess does cannot disturb him.

255
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,839
That's right.

256
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:03,839
Or putting it two-thirds down, he has grasped the deep secret that even in loving another, one should be sufficient unto oneself.

257
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:05,439
That's what you're saying.

258
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,880
We can't talk about it.

259
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:08,319
It's ahead of the story.

260
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:16,079
The night of resignation, which is what that's about, has a way of making unconditional commitments safe.

261
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,920
And that's and yet getting meaning out of them.

262
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:26,160
It's an amazingly interesting move that only Christian philosophers could have invented.

263
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,839
But I will talk about it next time.

264
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,160
But you're right to ask it.

265
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:42,640
The night of resignation is not an example of somebody who makes a defining commitment and sticks into it, sticks with it, and doesn't come out of it.

266
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,920
Oh, I'm so tempted to explain it all right now, but I can't.

267
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:50,319
I mean, because but the night of resignation, I have to say one more thing.

268
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:59,119
You when you forget it, then you just return to lower immediacy, to what Kierkegaard calls a lower immediate uh a lower nature.

269
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,240
Can you, and I'll leave this as a puzzle for you.

270
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:16,679
What would it be like to hold on to the meaning of your love or your commitment to some cause in such a way that you could keep the meaning of it, and yet it would be safe.

271
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,199
You wouldn't be returning to being a lower nature.

272
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,880
And in a certain sense, you wouldn't lose your higher immediacy.

273
00:25:23,879 --> 00:25:29,800
And yet, I just said that, of course, it's a very risky thing to have one of these commitments.

274
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:32,200
So, how do you get rid of the risk and keep the commitment?

275
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,559
The night of resignation does it.

276
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:38,920
And it's a kind of despair, because you can't get away with it.

277
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,840
But that's a long story for next time.

278
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,960
Let me go back to this.

279
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:48,679
But you're right to see that I'm contradicting, or seemingly contradicting what he says on the next page.

280
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:53,399
So, but you can't give it up and remain the same person, that's sure.

281
00:25:53,799 --> 00:26:02,519
The night of resignation manages not to give it up, to stay the same person, but not to, but to get rid of the risk.

282
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:13,320
That's you can think of that as having certain kind of defenses, although that's not going to help much either until I get there.

283
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:15,480
So, let's go back to where we are.

284
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,240
So, I just want to tell you more about how it's the defining relation.

285
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,319
I mean, that's my term, not Kierkegaard's.

286
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:30,279
It makes me a little worried when everyone in papers people are always saying Kierkegaard's notion of defining relation.

287
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:39,159
Well, he doesn't really have a notion of defining relation, but he has something that you could call that, where he wants to call it infinite passion.

288
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,319
That's his word for it.

289
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:48,319
And in in another book of his called The Concluding Unscientific Postscript, a very strange term.

290
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:52,079
And you don't really have to know that title or that book.

291
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:59,360
But you do have to know that infinite passion is not a very good term for this because of the passion.

292
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:02,000
It makes him sound too much like a romantic.

293
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,440
Remember, these romantics aren't the people who believe in romantic love.

294
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:11,599
They're the people who believe in lower immediacy, just being swept away by a huge emotion.

295
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:16,240
But when he says infinite passion, he means defining commitment.

296
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,640
And then he has a better word for it, the absolute venture.

297
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,640
You can see why that makes a little more sense.

298
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:35,680
The absolute venture is you let yourself respond to this calling coming at you from some cause or some person, and then you take a big risk.

299
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:42,319
He says in the postscript, it's not the same individual who makes this venture among others.

300
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:46,880
In making the absolute venture, he becomes another individual.

301
00:27:46,879 --> 00:27:49,279
Now, oh my gosh, that's a problem, too.

302
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:55,040
Every time I teach this, I notice something new that's hard and makes it harder than it has to be.

303
00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:04,640
Apparently, there's only one word in Danish for what in English is either a particular or an individual.

304
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,920
Now, you might think, well, after all, they're pretty much the same thing.

305
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,839
Why should there, what difference does it make?

306
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:13,520
Well, they're not the same thing at all, the way Kierkegaard understands them.

307
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:19,760
You can tell from the context of when he says the Enka is in Danish, which one he's talking about.

308
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,319
A particular is just any sort of entity.

309
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:28,319
For instance, your dog is a particular, a particular instance of whatever colleagues say or something.

310
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:35,520
An individual has this unique identity that comes from having an unconditional commitment.

311
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:44,680
You could put on your dog's tombstone, here lies a particular, but you couldn't say what Kierkegaard once carved on his tombstone, here lies an individual.

312
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:50,279
That's what he thinks is the most important, highest form of human life.

313
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:57,799
And then, and when you become an individual, particulars are down here, individuals are up here in his language.

314
00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:03,240
Unfortunately, no, he's only got one word in the context is supposed to tell you.

315
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,160
And neither of the two translators get it right most of the time.

316
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:11,959
And I'll have to tell you whenever we get there which he's doing.

317
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:17,799
There won't be a problem for you yet for another after the movie, even after that.

318
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:25,480
When we get to these things called problem one and problem two, the distinction between the particular and the individual is extremely important.

319
00:29:25,479 --> 00:29:28,440
But right now, just forget it.

320
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,680
Just keep it on hold.

321
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:35,640
So you become an individual by making the absolute venture.

322
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,480
And you can only do that with total involvement.

323
00:29:39,479 --> 00:29:42,599
And your commitment defines who you are.

324
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,000
Martin Luther King understood that too.

325
00:29:44,999 --> 00:30:10,839
I can't find, if anybody has a text of his, I think last talk, the same one about being on the mountain, which you hear bits of, doesn't he say in there, don't think of me as the man who won the Nobel Prize, don't think of me as the minister who led his people, but think of me as the person who got justice for my people, or something like that.

326
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:13,400
Does that sound familiar to anybody, or did I make it up?

327
00:30:13,399 --> 00:30:24,319
Well, if anybody can find it, see, I think he's saying, it's sort of like Kennedy's saying, don't think of me as the guy who would have done the moonshot to think of, I don't know what his commitment was, but if he had one.

328
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:33,120
But I think Martin Luther King is clear that they're trying to define what it is that makes him an individual.

329
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,999
And if anybody knows, let me know.

330
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:40,319
He did that.

331
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:42,959
So let me see if I need to say anything more about that.

332
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:51,279
Well, he had this bliss of being on the mountain, which is higher than any amount of detachment and reflection.

333
00:30:53,200 --> 00:31:01,680
But, and this is what I've been saying, I'm just summing up, mediation is a step, and you have to go through it to gain higher immediacy.

334
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,080
Otherwise, you can't tell your infatuations from your love.

335
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:12,399
You can't tell strong emotions from this kind of commitment, which needn't even be a strong emotion.

336
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:18,720
I mean, your unconditional commitment, he says, isn't sort of all kinds of fancy, fleeting feelings.

337
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,520
I don't know whether I could just open that doubt somewhere who talks about that.

338
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:36,560
Your unconditional commitment, he doesn't say this, but is clearly just as unconditional when you're making breakfast and only half awake as when you're in an intensely life and death mood.

339
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:39,040
It's who you are all the time.

340
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:51,040
And it's not going to be, you've got to get rid of these intense experiences being grabbed by stuff you don't understand and get this special thing.

341
00:31:51,040 --> 00:32:01,680
Okay, now, having said all that, I want to go through nine characteristics of the defining relation.

342
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:05,279
So, what I've been talking about so far is number one.

343
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,279
I've already done it.

344
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:08,520
It makes you an individual.

345
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,920
It defines who you are.

346
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,480
To drop it, deny it, is to contradict yourself.

347
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:19,159
And then I've also hinted at this other one, but I want to say more about it.

348
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,920
It gives you a world.

349
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:25,000
Your whole world is organized in terms of this concern.

350
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:32,279
You distinguish between what's important and what's not in terms of this concern.

351
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:39,480
That's really why he calls it an infinite passion, because it isn't a passion about anything particular.

352
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:42,039
It isn't anything specific.

353
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,480
It is, so that's not the way to put it.

354
00:32:45,479 --> 00:33:02,200
It is a passion about something specific, namely the person you love or the cause, and it makes you an individual, but it's not about something like any other object in your world.

355
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:10,200
All the objects in your world have whatever meaning they have because of your past experience and the culture and what other people think about them.

356
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:19,799
But this particular object isn't just in your world, but it defines what counts as real, what counts as important.

357
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,880
It defines your world.

358
00:33:21,879 --> 00:33:24,839
You don't have a world like that unless you've got an infinite commitment.

359
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:31,880
You've just got a sort of shared world, which is right, which is which you got with your language and you got growing up.

360
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:52,480
But he wants to distinguish between what could be the most important person in your world, and this super individual thing, individual whatever, that gives you a world, makes the distinction between what's serious and what's trivial, what's relevant and irrelevant, what's meaningful and meaningless.

361
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:59,839
That's a special idea of his, that there could be such an individual, such a something.

362
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:01,279
An individual is the wrong word.

363
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:06,239
I keep falling into it because that's what it makes you when you fall in love with what?

364
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,640
What are you going to call the other one?

365
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:16,319
A particular means just anybody, and it's not just anybody, it's some special super being in your world.

366
00:34:16,319 --> 00:34:20,720
Well, Kierkegaard later has a word for it, which is a paradigm.

367
00:34:27,439 --> 00:34:35,200
A paradigm is a particular entity which is definitive in some special way of all the other entities.

368
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:41,360
A famous philosopher of science also uses the word paradigm, Thomas Kuhn.

369
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:52,960
Thomas Kuhn, in The Structure of Scientific Revolution, which you will all read someday because it's the most bought of all academic books ever written.

370
00:34:53,279 --> 00:34:56,160
Have you ever heard of the structure of scientific revolutions?

371
00:34:56,319 --> 00:34:57,440
Anybody yet?

372
00:34:57,439 --> 00:34:58,480
Well, you will.

373
00:34:58,479 --> 00:35:18,400
Anyway, has in his notion a similar notion of paradigm, which for him is a particular something that some scientist does that defines what counts as the right way to do science, what counts as the right problems in science, what counts as relevant and irrelevant in science.

374
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:26,079
So when Newton wrote his Principia, that was a paradigm which defined classical Newtonian science.

375
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,760
And Kierkegaard's got a similar idea and a similar word.

376
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:37,560
So there is this, let's call it paradigm then, which sets up your world.

377
00:35:42,279 --> 00:35:45,559
As I say, determines what's important and not important.

378
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,359
It tells you when it's important to drop everything.

379
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:53,720
that you think is important and attend to it.

380
00:35:53,720 --> 00:36:01,560
And all the time, you're sort of in the background that it's telling you what to be, what's significant, what to pay attention to.

381
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:07,319
Okay, it helps understanding that number two, to go on to number three, that it can't be mediated.

382
00:36:07,319 --> 00:36:10,199
This is his anti-Hegel move.

383
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,440
It can't be put into concepts.

384
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:23,160
You can't articulate with a set of features that you could abstract what it is, what the lad sees in the princess, for instance.

385
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:29,720
You can't make explicit what this relationship means to you.

386
00:36:30,279 --> 00:36:31,079
What's the word?

387
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,959
Kuhn says the paradigm can't be rationalized.

388
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:35,720
It's exactly the same thing.

389
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:46,840
The scientists all know what the paradigm is, but they can't spell out and list what makes that piece of scientific work world-defining for them.

390
00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:51,000
And the Greeks don't have any such notions.

391
00:36:50,999 --> 00:36:57,079
They think from Plato on through Hegel that everything can be mediated.

392
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:03,160
You've got to be able to put it into words, into concepts, and explain it, or you don't really understand it.

393
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,000
You're just in lower immediacy.

394
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:14,520
Plato thought that what you couldn't conceptualize was not worth caring about.

395
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:30,080
So he had this interesting way of thinking about what looks like infinite passion or commitment, but really isn't, in the symposium, which you presumably haven't read yet, but hopefully for you you will read someday.

396
00:37:37,760 --> 00:38:03,680
The symposium is interesting because it starts, he thinks that people do get totally hooked on each other and go around sort of holding on to each other, first looking for each other, and then they finally find the other one that they've been looking for all this time, and they cling to them because it really completes them and that we're sort of destined for each other.

397
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,279
And he thinks that's a big joke.

398
00:38:05,279 --> 00:38:13,200
He's got it, that that story, which is so moving, is told by a famous comedy writer, Aristophanes.

399
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:23,600
Plato really thinks, and Plato says in the symposium, that you do get hooked on a single beautiful body, but then you discover, well, why just that one?

400
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,600
Why not all beautiful bodies?

401
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:30,960
Then you get hooked on some particular beautiful soul, and you think, well, why that person?

402
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:36,080
Why not everybody who's interesting to talk to and has a beautiful soul?

403
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:44,000
And finally, you see that the individuals are sort of petty and you mistook them for what's important, which is the universal.

404
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:46,559
And in the end, finally, the beautiful.

405
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,080
That's what you really want.

406
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:55,040
It's like getting stuck on some bottle of wine and thinking that's what you want when you really want what you really like is red wine.

407
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:02,319
And then you finally discover that what you really like is something like the perfectly drinkable something or other.

408
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:10,600
If you get more and more general, and from that point of view, you never want to get stuck with the individual.

409
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:22,600
And one of the reasons why I'm saying this is, and one of the features of what you find out as you give up these particulars is that you find out what is universal.

410
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,279
That should sound familiar.

411
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:39,960
And any person who has a rational soul and a soul that can be moved by beauty will be moved by the beautiful, which is always beautiful from all angles, everybody, everywhere.

412
00:39:39,959 --> 00:39:43,400
And that's what it would be to mediate it.

413
00:39:43,399 --> 00:39:45,559
But you can't do it.

414
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,519
One can't do that.

415
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,960
Now, let me give you an example with a paradigm and how it works.

416
00:39:50,439 --> 00:40:13,319
If you love somebody and you thought that you could list the characteristics that they had that made them adorable and lovable and so forth, then you would say maybe that they were smart and strong and sexy and witty and stylish and compassionate, who knows what, all.

417
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:21,560
And then, if you said that, you were only defining something very important and nice in your world.

418
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,039
Because that's still not to say they're a paradigm.

419
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:32,279
And the reason you can tell is: what if somebody came along with more, stronger, sexier, stylish, or wittier, compassionate, smarter, and so forth?

420
00:40:32,279 --> 00:40:34,279
Well, you could just go for them.

421
00:40:34,279 --> 00:40:38,600
Because all you, because what you make a list of all the traits that you like.

422
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,399
But that's not.

423
00:40:39,399 --> 00:40:47,079
If they're the paradigm, they define what it is to be smart and strong and sexy and witty and stylish.

424
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,640
They're the source of that meaning.

425
00:40:50,279 --> 00:40:56,080
That's why nobody can come along who's more attractive than they are.

426
00:40:56,399 --> 00:41:05,599
That's the difference between finding something important in your world, which you can define, and you can always find something more significant, more important in your world.

427
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,279
Maybe you will and maybe you won't.

428
00:41:07,279 --> 00:41:10,720
And then you find a paradigm which defines your world.

429
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:18,640
And if there really is such a thing, if you really find it, you got it for life because there's nothing that can come along and trump it.

430
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,720
Because it's telling you what's important.

431
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,359
It's showing you.

432
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:22,479
You can't even tell it.

433
00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:24,240
It's showing you what's important.

434
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,160
It can't be mediated.

435
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,079
If you think it can, you're making a complete fool of yourself.

436
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:38,480
Because what you're doing is trying to give an objective description and kind of defense of an unconditional commitment.

437
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:45,839
And Kierkegaard has this great example in the postscript of what it would look like to be objective about it.

438
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,720
And it's about, he talks about Don Quixote and Dulcinea.

439
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,999
Don Quixote, how many have read the, probably not, how many have read Don Quixote?

440
00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:54,799
It's not the like button.

441
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,480
Woo, look at that.

442
00:41:57,279 --> 00:41:59,999
I certainly hadn't read it when I was your age.

443
00:41:59,999 --> 00:42:04,879
But anyway, Don Quixote is a kind of parody of knights and ladies.

444
00:42:04,879 --> 00:42:06,159
That's what it's supposed to be.

445
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,920
And he's a knight and goes around with a sword and so forth, a lance.

446
00:42:11,919 --> 00:42:18,000
And he has his lady, Dulcinea, who's an ugly, stupid peasant girl.

447
00:42:17,999 --> 00:42:22,959
But he is a kind of parody of the chivalric thing.

448
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:28,240
He goes around saying she is objectively the most beautiful.

449
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:35,760
And he challenges any other knight to fight, who denies that she is the most beautiful.

450
00:42:38,919 --> 00:42:50,840
He tries to turn this defining commitment into an objective thing that every rational person has to recognize, or else they're just stupid, or else they're just stubborn, and you have to wipe them out.

451
00:42:50,839 --> 00:42:56,119
And of course, Kierkegaard says that's just funny.

452
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:11,799
That's what's funny about the whole piece of the story of Don Quixote, that he would have this sort of wrong view of not only fighting windmills, but thinking that what he has to do is get everybody to agree that Dulcinea is the most beautiful girl in the world.

453
00:43:11,799 --> 00:43:14,599
Now, that's so much, it can't be mediated.

454
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,920
You can't get everybody to agree to it.

455
00:43:16,919 --> 00:43:18,279
It's not that way.

456
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,799
And what happens then?

457
00:43:19,799 --> 00:43:22,840
Well, then it gets really interesting and weird.

458
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:30,040
So your passion actually produces the paradigm.

459
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:45,319
That is, what makes the person you love adorable, totally makes them your savior, to talk like Dante with Beatrice.

460
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:46,039
Well, what?

461
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,760
Is there any objective fact about them?

462
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:49,559
No.

463
00:43:49,799 --> 00:43:50,360
No.

464
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:54,279
It's just your passion for them, or your commitment to them.

465
00:43:54,279 --> 00:43:55,960
I have passions too dangerous.

466
00:43:56,359 --> 00:43:58,999
Your, well, but what was the tillick one?

467
00:43:58,999 --> 00:44:00,439
Your unconditional commitment?

468
00:44:00,439 --> 00:44:01,720
No, that's mine.

469
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:05,400
Your ultimate concern.

470
00:44:05,399 --> 00:44:14,200
It's just your ultimate concern that makes them literally adorable by you.

471
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:18,760
And what makes them literally the savior for you.

472
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,880
They're not going to save anybody else, Beatrice didn't save anybody but Dante.

473
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:47,120
So you get this idea that it's your subjective experience, which is not subjective, where that means arbitrary, changeable, lower immediacy, but your infinite venture with them that makes them the saving thing for you.

474
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:57,360
Now, that's, remember I said that Kierkegaard is going to turn philosophy upside down and make contradictions out of what the philosopher said.

475
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:01,359
That's truth is subjectivity in Kierkegaard.

476
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:05,920
That is, where the how, as he puts it in the postscript, becomes the what.

477
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:18,400
If your how is infinite passion, then it becomes a what in the sense that this person can be the savior for you, be the paradigm for you.

478
00:45:18,399 --> 00:45:24,960
The truth is that this is a paradigm, but it's not an objective truth, and it's not a paradigm for everybody.

479
00:45:24,959 --> 00:45:27,439
It's not like science or them.

480
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:32,879
It's only a paradigm for you in this particular way, is what I'm saying now.

481
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:38,319
And it's the truth for you, and it's only your higher subjectivity.

482
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,999
Kierkegaard says, well, there is a kind of lower subjectivity.

483
00:45:41,999 --> 00:45:44,560
That's this stuff that everybody has.

484
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:49,600
And then there's this higher subjectivity, which he calls, he uses the same word.

485
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:53,439
And that's the truth, in this special sense of truth.

486
00:45:53,439 --> 00:46:01,999
Not an objective truth, but nonetheless, something you would die for if it's appropriate and required.

487
00:46:01,999 --> 00:46:04,480
You could become a martyr for it.

488
00:46:04,479 --> 00:46:09,879
So, okay, so you're in, let's see what I've got here.

489
00:46:09,959 --> 00:46:11,480
Anything else?

490
00:46:11,479 --> 00:46:13,240
Your how produces a what?

491
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,600
I said that.

492
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,439
Okay, now onward.

493
00:46:16,439 --> 00:46:17,559
That was number four.

494
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,360
Five.

495
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:23,639
It has the peculiar characteristic, only Kierkegaard could manage to spell out so much.

496
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:38,600
I mean, all he did was have this crazy obsession with Regina and ran off to Berlin and managed to say more interesting things about romantic love, which it isn't even clear that he knows what it is, than anybody ever said before.

497
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,279
So this is an interesting.

498
00:46:40,279 --> 00:46:46,360
The defining relation has the peculiar quality of being both accidental and necessary.

499
00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:47,799
Now, what does that mean?

500
00:46:47,799 --> 00:46:49,880
Well, it's certainly accidental.

501
00:46:49,879 --> 00:46:55,960
Let's suppose now that there's somebody that you do or will love in a Kierkegaard kind of way.

502
00:46:55,959 --> 00:47:10,840
It turns out it was so solely accidental that you were in the same college, you were in the same class, you were on the same plane, whatever it was that they out of the billion people in the world happened to come across your experience.

503
00:47:10,839 --> 00:47:18,200
But once they define you, then they become necessary in your life.

504
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,840
Necessary like a definition.

505
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:22,920
Like 2 plus 2 equals 4.

506
00:47:22,919 --> 00:47:27,000
This is, you are the lover of the princess.

507
00:47:26,999 --> 00:47:28,760
That defines you.

508
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:37,559
And just like 2 plus 2 equals 4 is true, not, in this case, it isn't important for everybody, because that will get you back into something else.

509
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:43,480
But 2 plus 2 equals 4 is a necessary truth, and therefore it's true for all time.

510
00:47:43,479 --> 00:47:45,400
We'll get to that in a minute.

511
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:54,080
And so this kind of relationship begins at a certain moment and is entirely accidental.

512
00:47:54,080 --> 00:48:08,960
And yet it tends, and it becomes necessary, not by your objectively realizing it, it's necessary, like 2 plus 2 equals 4, but by your passion, your commitment making it necessary.

513
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:13,440
But in your life, it becomes the definition that defines you.

514
00:48:13,439 --> 00:48:18,719
And like a triangle has three sides, you are the lover of the princess.

515
00:48:18,879 --> 00:48:29,039
So Kierkegaard discovers that there's not only a detached kind of necessity like a triangle has three sides, but an involved kind of necessity in a defining relation.

516
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:33,279
It's a different kind of definition and a different kind of necessity.

517
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,439
And just to see, well, and how do people normally deal with this when they think about it?

518
00:48:39,439 --> 00:48:44,000
Because everybody thinks about it, really, who gets involved in this kind of love thing.

519
00:48:43,999 --> 00:48:54,000
Well, you get a notion that somehow they must have been meant for each other, destined for each other, because it looks like it couldn't just be accidental.

520
00:48:53,999 --> 00:48:57,440
If it's necessary, in a certain sense, that's true.

521
00:48:57,439 --> 00:49:16,240
You are the person you become, the lover of this princess, let's say Mary, then the lover, you become the lover of Mary, and in a certain sense, you, who now become that, were destined to be, to encounter Mary, because that's who you are.

522
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,599
But of course, that's how it looks from inside when you're involved.

523
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,839
But from the outside, it still looks completely arbitrary and accidental.

524
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:28,720
And to put those two together, people talk about destiny and fate and so forth.

525
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,319
But that's nothing, there's nothing really you can say that doesn't mean much.

526
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:33,439
It doesn't help much.

527
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:46,440
There's just this peculiar thing that Kierkegaard has discovered: that something could start to be necessary at a certain moment by virtue of the passion that you've got.

528
00:49:47,879 --> 00:49:51,399
And okay, so much for that.

529
00:49:51,399 --> 00:49:54,359
Now, that gets you to another one of his slogans in a minute.

530
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:55,559
I'm almost at it.

531
00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:03,160
So, number six, this is going to restructure temporality for you, your experience of time.

532
00:50:04,439 --> 00:50:14,919
Because once you've got this experience, all your future actions are determined by what this tells you is important and not important.

533
00:50:14,919 --> 00:50:17,160
Not determined in the sense of determinism.

534
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,360
Let's put it another way.

535
00:50:18,359 --> 00:50:29,000
All your future actions are, you decide on them, and they have importance for you in relation to this defining relationship.

536
00:50:28,999 --> 00:50:39,319
And all your past, it turns out, to have been empty up to you until you met this person in terms of when you see everything in terms of this relationship.

537
00:50:39,319 --> 00:50:55,960
So, this defining commitment retroactively defines your past as empty and defines whatever is going to be important for your future forever, that is, for your whole lifetime.

538
00:50:56,279 --> 00:51:12,440
So, and another way to put it, let's see, moment.

539
00:51:12,439 --> 00:51:13,799
Yeah, I divided two.

540
00:51:13,799 --> 00:51:18,279
I've got two points where I think they're so close it's hard for me to keep them apart, but I will.

541
00:51:18,279 --> 00:51:27,600
So this does the temporal field for you, and it does time for you in the way I just described.

542
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,200
But there's something else.

543
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,959
It gives you, and I need to, and what's the slogan for this?

544
00:51:32,959 --> 00:51:34,880
You won't recognize it yet.

545
00:51:34,879 --> 00:51:45,040
And what I'm telling you is how you can find in your life by this kind of commitment what Kierkegaard calls eternity in time.

546
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:52,240
Remember I said, Kierkegaard says in the postscript, I didn't say that, that eternity is only possible in time.

547
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,760
He doesn't quite say that.

548
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,999
I looked it up, but it was equally.

549
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,600
He says eternity is only possible in existing.

550
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:06,159
But for him, existing means living a human temporal life.

551
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,400
So let me just do it my way.

552
00:52:08,399 --> 00:52:13,680
So how does he get this peculiar conclusion?

553
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:41,200
Well, the idea is, and it's going to turn out to be, by the way, a very important idea for Dostoevsky too, and a very important idea that Nietzsche is against a lot of the issues that once were about whether God as the supreme being existed or not turn into the question, is there something like eternity possible and can we get into relation to eternity?

554
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:50,319
But that can't mean, as it did in Plato, can we get into relation to some eternal definition like a triangle has 180 degrees?

555
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:51,760
So what could it mean?

556
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,560
Well, I sort of stacked up what it means.

557
00:52:54,560 --> 00:53:04,480
I mean, remember, I said once you get into this relation, you know that for all future time, this is going to be the issue for you.

558
00:53:04,479 --> 00:53:05,479
What's going to matter?

559
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,600
What's going to be real?

560
00:53:06,919 --> 00:53:10,279
And you know, up to this moment, you missed it.

561
00:53:10,279 --> 00:53:30,440
So you get a picture of time in which you're going along moment by moment by moment by moment, and each moment retroactively interprets the previous one.

562
00:53:30,439 --> 00:53:35,159
That's what time looks like before you get eternity in time.

563
00:53:35,399 --> 00:53:40,600
Let me give you a good example of it from Sartre, who's got these great examples.

564
00:53:40,919 --> 00:53:50,360
He talks about how it's always up for grabs for you, and you always sort of have to reinterpret your experience.

565
00:53:50,359 --> 00:53:56,600
So, for instance, I'll use my example, and I'll give you Sart's, which is better, but mine is more close to home.

566
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:04,839
You might think that your experience in Berkeley right now is just terrific, and then in a few months, you might think, boy, was this a mistake?

567
00:54:04,839 --> 00:54:08,840
I wish I were someplace else, either some other college or none.

568
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:12,760
And what a mistake I made when I thought it was terrific.

569
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,919
And then after a few more months, you may think, no, this is the happiest time in my life.

570
00:54:16,919 --> 00:54:19,319
I'll never really be so happy again.

571
00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:23,559
And what a great luck it was to choose this place and come here, and so forth.

572
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,480
And it just keeps going on like that.

573
00:54:25,479 --> 00:54:28,440
It never gets settled what it is.

574
00:54:28,439 --> 00:54:30,519
But Sartre's example is more dramatic.

575
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:46,359
He says somebody could have what was a very overwhelming emotional experience in their adolescence, let's say at 15 or whatever, and they take it as a religious experience, and they become, we'll say, a monk, or none would do too, but I need one or the other.

576
00:54:46,359 --> 00:54:47,640
They become a monk.

577
00:54:47,640 --> 00:55:02,319
And then after a while as a monk, they get bored and feel that they're not really getting the most out of their possibilities, and they give up being a monk, and they go out into the material world and make lots of money and think that's great.

578
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:13,519
But again, so let's say on their deathbed, they realize that they were really the best person they were when they were the monk, not when they were the rich materialist, and they convert again.

579
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,679
And Sartre says, and so it could go on.

580
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:21,360
It's just an accident if they die then, and that gives this accidental meaning to their life.

581
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:25,200
But you never can settle the constant reinterpretation.

582
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:39,440
Now, what I've been saying, and what Kierkegaard is saying, is that you can settle this reinterpretation if you are infinitely involved, if you have an unconditional commitment.

583
00:55:39,439 --> 00:55:45,120
Because then you go, as you're living along, you get what he calls an instant.

584
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,520
And that's the super moment of time.

585
00:55:47,520 --> 00:56:05,920
And that super moment of time retroactively interprets all of this and says you were missing it, and retroactively interprets everything that's going to come and says that's going to be the issue in your life, and that's going to be the issue for you forever.

586
00:56:05,919 --> 00:56:16,639
Where forever in this sort of involved thing doesn't mean in some other world where numbers are or where the afterlife is.

587
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,480
It means forever in your life.

588
00:56:18,479 --> 00:56:22,720
As long as you live, you know what's important.

589
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,279
And you have a paradigm, and so forth.

590
00:56:25,279 --> 00:56:57,640
That means that you, that's what it is, that's to say that in existence you become eternal, is that by committing yourself, you then all this, you define, you get out of the up-for-grabs character of time, where it's constantly reinterpreted, and you find something solid and meaningful in your life that you know already, but you can't change it and stay who you are.

591
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:06,599
And for you, it's going to be forever up to the end, the paradigm, and whatever that tells you you need to do, and live and die for, and so forth.

592
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,960
That question.

593
00:57:08,359 --> 00:57:09,479
You're ready, Luke, because I'm not sure.

594
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,400
Maybe I'll hear it.

595
00:57:11,399 --> 00:57:12,520
Go ahead.

596
00:57:15,959 --> 00:57:19,640
Call it a calling?

597
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:24,839
Can't hear it.

598
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:25,799
Will you try it?

599
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:29,240
Do you get to decide what the paradigm is?

600
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:32,680
It's called a calling, but does that mean that you have some sort of choice?

601
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,279
Aha, aha, good.

602
00:57:34,279 --> 00:57:34,839
Thanks.

603
00:57:35,879 --> 00:57:37,239
That makes life a lot easier.

604
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,000
You do not get to decide.

605
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:44,840
Just think of the phenomenon of romantic love.

606
00:57:44,839 --> 00:57:57,560
I mean, something comes around that calls you in the sense that you can't resist making it a permanent part of who you are and defining yourself on the basis of it.

607
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:05,560
What you can do is reject it, refuse it, be defensive about it, not let it drag you in.

608
00:58:05,879 --> 00:58:10,359
So you've got a freedom with respect to the calling.

609
00:58:10,359 --> 00:58:22,000
You don't have to, when God calls you to a vocation, that is, when something calls you with authority to pin your whole life on it, you don't have to do that.

610
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:38,960
But if you don't, you're just going to be one of these lower natures which change from day to day and whose temporality is just a whole lot of up moments, whose significance is constantly up for reinterpretation, and you'll never know what your life really means.

611
00:58:38,959 --> 00:58:41,760
But if you want that, you can have it.

612
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,279
And you might want it because the alternative is so risky.

613
00:58:45,279 --> 00:58:47,840
That's what we really have to talk about next.

614
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:52,639
But I think I should, no, but let me set it up and then we'll talk about it.

615
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,920
So where are we?

616
00:58:53,919 --> 00:58:58,559
Well, I've just said that it's irreversible, without saying it.

617
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,919
So this is number eight.

618
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,680
So it's irreversible.

619
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:05,040
You can't move from one defining relation to another.

620
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:12,880
If you wrench it out of yourself, I was really talking about you can reject it altogether.

621
00:59:12,879 --> 00:59:15,680
But let's suppose you don't reject it.

622
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,360
Let's suppose you get into it.

623
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:20,640
Once you get into it, you can't get out of it.

624
00:59:21,279 --> 00:59:28,639
If you deny it, it destroys who you are as the individual that you were.

625
00:59:28,959 --> 00:59:31,360
This is on 71.

626
00:59:33,279 --> 00:59:36,879
So let's, but back where I was a long time ago, eight lines down.

627
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:46,240
He first makes sure that this really is the content of his life, and his soul is too healthy and proud to squander the least thing on an inebriation.

628
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,000
He is not cowardly.

629
00:59:47,999 --> 00:59:58,319
He is not afraid to let his love steal upon his most secret hidden thoughts, to let it twine itself in countless coils about every ligament of his consciousness.

630
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:01,120
That's a very peculiar phrase.

631
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:10,599
But that's to say that you can't actually let it sort of take over your understanding of who you are.

632
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:18,520
So, and then he says, If this love, if the love becomes unhappy, he'll never be able to wrench himself out of it.

633
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:22,920
And a little skipping down, this for this moment is life and death.

634
01:00:24,919 --> 01:00:30,119
That's supposed to tell you that once you get into it, you can't get out of it.

635
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,879
Let me say one more thing, and then you could talk.

636
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,799
You can't get in, you can't get out of it.

637
01:00:33,799 --> 01:00:37,400
That doesn't mean you can't betray it and deny it.

638
01:00:37,399 --> 01:00:43,000
But if you do, you'll become a sort of a zombie because you won't know who you are or what's important.

639
01:00:42,999 --> 01:00:49,079
The best example that I know is, I haven't reread it for a long time, but I think it's the end of 1984.

640
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,839
How many read 1984?

641
01:00:52,520 --> 01:01:04,120
Doesn't he say when the rats are attacking him that he wishes they were attacking her, the woman he loves, and who gives meaning to his life and keeps him from going to be like every other zombie in that culture?

642
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:05,960
He wishes they were attacking her.

643
01:01:05,959 --> 01:01:12,039
And once they get him to say that, to think that, to realize he's fine, then he's nobody.

644
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:16,520
They can do anything they want with him because he's just another zombie in the culture.

645
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:26,120
That's a dramatic example of what Kierkegaard is talking about when he says that if you tear yourself out of it, it's death.

646
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,600
And as long as you're in it, you're alive.

647
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,279
Now, question.

648
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,039
Yeah, here's the thing.

649
01:01:34,359 --> 01:01:35,399
You get to have a microphone.

650
01:01:35,399 --> 01:01:36,600
We have all kinds of.

651
01:01:37,879 --> 01:01:38,839
You don't want the microphone.

652
01:01:38,919 --> 01:01:39,799
Okay, go ahead.

653
01:01:39,799 --> 01:01:40,440
I can hear you.

654
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:41,159
I'll repeat it.

655
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:42,519
Go ahead.

656
01:01:42,839 --> 01:01:49,839
First of all, would you get strong committee become a person since you can't get out of it.

657
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,199
Wonderful, wonderful.

658
01:01:53,199 --> 01:01:55,359
You're my Nietzschean for the Course.

659
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:56,640
That's what Nietzsche says.

660
01:01:56,959 --> 01:01:59,680
He says commitments are prisons.

661
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,680
Exactly what you just said.

662
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:04,479
Okay, then yes, I mean, maybe.

663
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,760
I mean, it depends on what you.

664
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:26,159
Yes, yes, if you find it too confining to have one meaning in your life that gives it significance and gives a moment, lets you know what's important and not important and who you are, it's a kind of trade-off.

665
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:30,559
You can have that, and then it's going to be like a prison.

666
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:42,079
You can give it up, and then Kierkegaard thinks you'll have a totally, you can have a life that's sort of fun, but you won't have a deeply meaningful, significant life.

667
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:47,359
And this is now Kierkegaard going head-on with Nietzsche, you'll be in despair.

668
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:59,359
But we haven't got to the sort of argument that he has, which is that the kind of self that human beings are, they need eternity and so forth.

669
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:04,079
I mean, if he could make you believe that, then, of course, he'd have to say, well, it's not a prison.

670
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:07,999
It's something you have to go, you really, you really couldn't get along without.

671
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,239
It's better not to be in despair.

672
01:03:12,239 --> 01:03:15,439
Anyway, that's a deep, deep, deep issue.

673
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:24,159
And it doesn't get settled until, well, Dostoevsky has something to say about it, and Nietzsche has something to say about it.

674
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:28,959
Okay, well, we can't, you know, but that's the right thing to think.

675
01:03:28,959 --> 01:03:35,760
And you may all end up thinking that by the time you read Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky and Nietzsche.

676
01:03:36,199 --> 01:03:44,119
At the end of the course, I'll ask you what you think about it, because it's really important to know where the culture is, what you think about it.

677
01:03:44,119 --> 01:03:45,799
But I can't explain that either yet.

678
01:03:45,799 --> 01:03:47,559
So let's go back to this.

679
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:52,119
There's no second chance, according to Kierkegaard.

680
01:03:52,119 --> 01:04:01,159
If you give this up, if you betray it, if you renounce it and say it isn't important, that's the end for you.

681
01:04:01,799 --> 01:04:05,799
And that's, and now that was number eight.

682
01:04:05,799 --> 01:04:20,520
Number nine is, and therefore you become completely vulnerable because this finite commitment to somebody or something can always fail.

683
01:04:21,959 --> 01:04:27,480
He's not concerned, not being a Nietzschean, with the fact that you may find it stifling and want to give it.

684
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:28,999
He says, he spails things.

685
01:04:28,999 --> 01:04:31,479
Of course, it's the best thing that could happen to you.

686
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:34,680
However, it may be just too scary.

687
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:57,480
That is, and then now I have to say something very important: that it's part of his story, his understanding that you can't get defining commitment by making an absolute venture unless you commit yourself to something which he calls finite and temporal.

688
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,359
Could be another person, could be a cause.

689
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,680
What you have to see is it's important.

690
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:26,239
You can't get this by, say, committing yourself to a scientific theory, committing yourself to a utopian cause, committing, because, say, you want to suppose you commit yourself to the ultimate triumph of the proletariat, and you spend your whole life doing what you can to help the proletariat become self-conscious and triumph, but by the time you die, they haven't done it yet.

691
01:05:26,239 --> 01:05:27,439
That doesn't matter.

692
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:36,159
I mean, you, you, but you didn't, but that doesn't give you enough of a concreteness to know what's really important and not important.

693
01:05:36,159 --> 01:05:37,919
It's not a life and death thing.

694
01:05:37,919 --> 01:05:42,159
You can always say, if you're not feeling like it, well, I'm going to stay home today and relax.

695
01:05:42,159 --> 01:05:44,720
The proletariat will get there sooner or later.

696
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:55,199
But you have to, but if you commit yourself, like Martin Luther King, to justice for the black people now, that gives you a day-to-day sense of what you have to do.

697
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:59,439
He can't stay home and say, it's raining, I'm not going to go on a peace march today.

698
01:05:59,919 --> 01:06:10,879
Every day, when he wakes up in the morning, he knows what's important, like whether it's the bright weather for a peace march, and he knows what's unimportant, like whether they remember to buy the breakfast groceries.

699
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:40,959
And if you've got one of these commitments, then it structures, it's a paradigm that structures the finite, the world, but, and, and, makes your life full of meaning and bliss, and you're on the mountain and all that, and that's fine, but you can only get that kind of fulfillment by committing yourself to some finite project.

700
01:06:40,959 --> 01:07:02,559
If you just say, well, I'm going to do the best I can and discover the best theory I can in science, and that's that'll keep me busy, that's fine, but that's not going to get you day-to-day meaning and a world in which there are fruitful distinctions between what's trivial and not, what's important and not, what's real and not, and so forth.

701
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:23,079
Okay, once you see, if Kierkegaard convinces you, and he convinces me anyway, that you can't get this kind of meaning in your life that tells you at every moment something, what's significant and what's not, you can't get that except by commitment to something finite and temporal.

702
01:07:23,079 --> 01:07:28,119
And that, and now I haven't convinced you of this yet, that it's on the back burner.

703
01:07:28,119 --> 01:07:37,079
And you need a commitment to something finite and temporal in order to have a life that's significant and meaningful.

704
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:38,760
What follows from all that?

705
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:46,999
Well, it follows that you're in big trouble because you commit yourself to something finite and temporal, then it's vulnerable.

706
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,999
It can't be otherwise.

707
01:07:49,159 --> 01:07:51,799
Martin Luther King's cause could have failed.

708
01:07:52,119 --> 01:07:59,799
The white people from the north could have just not been too scared to come down and march in the beach marches after a few of them were killed.

709
01:07:59,799 --> 01:08:08,519
Then, if that had happened, then it would have been over for him and his life, and he'd never have been on the mountain, and being Martin Luther King would have been a disaster.

710
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:10,839
And there's nothing you can do about that.

711
01:08:10,839 --> 01:08:18,359
And so the question is: why would anybody in their right mind put themselves in this risky situation?

712
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:34,439
Or if you don't want to be Martin Luther King, just ask yourself whether you want to have a case of romantic love like in the old days when you would be plunged into grief if the other person left you or died and everything would become gray and meaningless for you.

713
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:36,279
Who would want to do that?

714
01:08:37,239 --> 01:08:39,799
And the answer is: nobody.

715
01:08:39,799 --> 01:08:45,959
What you'd like is a defining commitment that is as solid as a rock, as it ought to be.

716
01:08:45,959 --> 01:08:55,600
If it's going to be the basis of your whole identity in your world, it ought to be as it ought to be the most basically solid thing you could possibly find.

717
01:08:55,919 --> 01:08:58,399
And here it is, totally vulnerable.

718
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,239
What do you do about that?

719
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:03,439
Well, there's lots of ways to deal with it.

720
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:16,559
One of them is, well, one of them is you think it makes no sense to build everything on something fragile, something not guaranteed, and therefore this kind of relationship is impossible.

721
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:20,319
And Kierkegaard does think it's impossible in his special terms.

722
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:28,479
When he says impossible, he doesn't just, and he means that it's the kind of relationship that just doesn't make sense.

723
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:31,919
Nobody in their right mind would want to do such a thing.

724
01:09:31,919 --> 01:09:36,239
And that's, then what do you do about that?

725
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:46,799
Well, if it's got this dangerous character, I mean, one thing is, which you and Nietzsche represent is, well, why in the world do you let yourself get into this impossible situation?

726
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:53,919
But another way to deal with it is to try to fix it in some way.

727
01:09:53,919 --> 01:10:12,559
And it seems to me all the religions of the world, as far as I know, somebody comes and tells me another, I'll be interested, but are dedicated to getting you not to get into such a kind of relationship, not to put all the meaning of your life into one commitment.

728
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:17,680
So Buddhist teaches you non-attachment to free you from suffering.

729
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:24,720
And the Stoics wanted to merge with the cosmic order where there would be no bad surprises.

730
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,600
And Plato says that you should merge with the good.

731
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:33,439
That is, the important part of you, the rational part of you, merges with the rational part of the universe.

732
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,519
What could be safer than that?

733
01:10:36,039 --> 01:10:40,199
And even in Christianity, that's what's interesting.

734
01:10:40,199 --> 01:10:40,520
St.

735
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,600
Augustine, I'm going to talk about the next time.

736
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:42,919
And St.

737
01:10:42,999 --> 01:10:47,079
Thomas Aquinas have ways of avoiding the risk.

738
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:54,919
Kierkegaard's got the view, I'm going to start with it next time, that only if you take the risk will you get the reward.

739
01:10:55,239 --> 01:11:00,279
And that seems to be a uniquely Judeo-Christian idea.

740
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:15,159
And that's what he's going to talk about next, because the issue about the night of resignation, just keep this in mind as you read and reread this difficult preamble from the heart.

741
01:11:15,159 --> 01:11:23,879
The issue for the night of resignation is: can you keep a world which is significant and you have an identity and yet make it safe?

742
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:28,439
That even the Christian knight will try that.

743
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:36,839
But ultimately, the Christian message, according to Kierkegaard, is you've got to take the risk if you want the bliss.
