1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
So, the first thing I wanted to do was to go back for a minute to brief habits because we had a discussion.

2
00:00:06,921 --> 00:00:17,800
I had it with someone over there, I believe, about what Nietzsche thought was the worst thing, where there was a kind of brief habit that he couldn't stand.

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,680
And I forget what whoever it was said.

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,921
If you remember who you are, you can say it again.

5
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:27,241
But I said I thought that was wrong, and I think I found a passage to show it.

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,161
But what did you say again?

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,641
Why is having no habits at all bad?

8
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,120
Ah, that's not it.

9
00:00:46,841 --> 00:00:49,000
Interestingly enough, I found a passage.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,560
I said I thought that he thought that I didn't say it clearly enough.

11
00:00:53,560 --> 00:01:10,440
Oddly enough, Nietzsche, who's telling you that he's a kind of, sort of free spirit, is plugging brief habits, which already are out of the meaning business, out of the eternity business, into the wonder business.

12
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,560
But he's not the freest spirit.

13
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:21,161
There is a kind of free spirit, sort of really postmodern, which he's imagining, which he couldn't, he says is just too much for him.

14
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:22,601
He couldn't stand it.

15
00:01:22,601 --> 00:01:26,361
But you need two passages put together to see this.

16
00:01:26,361 --> 00:01:47,000
At the bottom of 237, that is, in 295, which is the brief habits piece, he says, most intolerable, to be sure, and the terrible par excellence would be for me, that is Nietzsche, a life entirely devoid of habits, a life that would demand perpetual improvisation.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,880
That would be my exile in my Siberia.

18
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:54,641
Now, maybe that, you might think, would be a kind of nihilism, but it isn't.

19
00:01:54,641 --> 00:02:04,641
He says on 290 that that would be the most extreme and I guess good kind of brief habit, though it's hard to picture what it would even be.

20
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:11,120
If you look on 289 at the bottom, that's 347, but way into it.

21
00:02:11,361 --> 00:02:16,240
Just at the very end of aphorism 347, that's page 289.

22
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:38,240
He says, one can conceive such a pleasure and power of self-determination, such a freedom of the will, that the spirit would take leave of all faith and every wish for certainty, being practiced in maintaining himself on insubstantial ropes and possibilities and dancing even near abysses.

23
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,000
Such a spirit would be the very spirit par excellence.

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:55,680
Now, I don't know for sure, but it looks like he's saying that's even freer than he can be with his feeling that he should sort of sink into each brief habit and hold on to it as long as it lasts.

25
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:06,080
I guess I can't even picture what this free spirit would be because he wouldn't even hardly be outgrowing anything because he wouldn't be in anything in order to outgrow it.

26
00:03:06,081 --> 00:03:08,081
But I just read you what's there.

27
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:11,440
You might come in and tell me some way to read this.

28
00:03:11,601 --> 00:03:13,201
You have a view about that?

29
00:03:25,521 --> 00:03:33,680
And even dancing around abysses, that doesn't seem like, I mean, maybe, but what would be then this most, well, never mind.

30
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,721
Let's talk about it more.

31
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:36,001
I don't know what it is.

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,520
I just wanted to tell you, because last time I said, I thought there was something about dancing somewhere in here, and I finally found it.

33
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:43,641
So now, end of that.

34
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,000
That's just a leftover little piece from last time.

35
00:03:47,240 --> 00:04:02,041
The main subject for this time is the almost free spirits, and they include, and this is what's interesting, Jesus, and they would include Markle.

36
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:10,200
And that begins to bring me to the similarities between Nietzsche and Dostoevsky on the one hand.

37
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:17,000
And then the second half of the lecture, we'll get to the big differences between Nietzsche and Dostoevsky.

38
00:04:17,961 --> 00:04:29,560
And that's where I want to sort of compare the various views of life that are being proposed by Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Dostoevsky.

39
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,201
And finally, after that, if there's time today, and if not, that's fine.

40
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:45,960
On Tuesday, I want to hear your views about, or take a vote at least, about which way of life is the one that you find convincing, if any.

41
00:04:45,961 --> 00:04:48,201
But it takes a while, so let's go.

42
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,681
So we've got Nietzsche's Jesus.

43
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,641
I told you to bring the Antichrist and the Twilights of the Idols.

44
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,880
So we're on 152.

45
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:12,921
And that is, he says, in aphorism 29, what I am concerned with is the psychological type of the Redeemer.

46
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:15,640
And we don't know yet what that means.

47
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:22,361
And it starts out looking rather bad for the Redeemer from Kierkegaard's, from Nietzsche's point of view.

48
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:31,601
That is, he says, where he doesn't say it.

49
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,520
Or 155.

50
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,041
He says it in about five lines down.

51
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:44,641
One has to regret that no Dostoevsky lived in the neighborhood of this most interesting decadent.

52
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,000
That's Jesus.

53
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,601
I mean someone who could feel the thrilling fascination of such a combination of the sublime, the sick, the childish.

54
00:05:53,601 --> 00:06:05,440
That should remove you who read The Idiot, and I remember there were very few, that sounds like a very quick summary of the view of Jesus as the idiot in The Idiot.

55
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,240
And that suggests that maybe Dostoevsky read it.

56
00:06:09,281 --> 00:06:10,321
Nietzsche read it.

57
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:16,720
People think that if Nietzsche has read any of the Dostoevsky novels, that would be the one he's read.

58
00:06:17,201 --> 00:06:32,641
And it also could remind you of Markle, who is sublime and sick and childish, but is saying these wonderful revealing of God and connectedness and love pronouncements.

59
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,320
But he is a decadent.

60
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,960
So we have to understand what's that.

61
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:40,721
He's not like a Socrates decadent.

62
00:06:40,721 --> 00:06:42,000
That's the next thing to say.

63
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,240
I mean, Socrates was really decadent.

64
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:53,440
I mean, his instincts were all in total chaos, and he wanted to die, and he was against the body and against life and so forth.

65
00:06:53,441 --> 00:06:57,681
That's the picture that comes down of Socrates through Plato.

66
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,841
That's not at all like Jesus.

67
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:05,961
And now comes one of the most surprising lines in the book about on 156.

68
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:15,801
After all the ranting against Christianity, about 15 lines from the bottom, one could, with some freedom of expression, call Jesus a free spirit.

69
00:07:16,361 --> 00:07:18,521
And now, why would he do that?

70
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,160
Well, he has certain things in common with Nietzsche as free spirit.

71
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,561
He cares nothing for what is fixed.

72
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:26,601
That's good.

73
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,921
He's not, according to Dostoevsky, in the eternity business.

74
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,641
He's in the constant overcoming.

75
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,160
The word killeth, everything fixed killeth.

76
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,041
He's putting his version or his spin on it.

77
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:49,881
The concept, the experience of life, in the only form he knows it, is opposed to any kind of word, formula, law, faith, dogma.

78
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,161
Remember, Jesus says he comes to fulfill the law.

79
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,161
He doesn't have to obey the law anymore.

80
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,080
He goes on the Sabbath and cures people.

81
00:07:57,081 --> 00:07:58,601
You're not supposed to do that.

82
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,321
And Nietzsche's got something right there.

83
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:16,201
Remember, way back I said that's where your feeling, your desire, your joy or non-joy is the test of whether you're a good person or not, not whether you obey the law or not.

84
00:08:16,201 --> 00:08:22,921
And that makes Jesus, if you cut it up that way, sound like Nietzsche.

85
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:32,921
And he wants to, but if you're going to say that, then you've got to distinguish Nietzsche from the Christians, what they made of Nietzsche.

86
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:39,081
And that's on 154.

87
00:08:41,961 --> 00:08:42,760
No, it isn't.

88
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,881
That's still.

89
00:08:44,201 --> 00:08:45,320
Why am I saying that?

90
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:46,601
Just a second.

91
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:57,440
Ah, oh, I'm saying, get ready for the fact that we're gonna, he's going to be telling you about Jesus for a minute, but then he's going to tell you, of course, the Christians immediately lost it.

92
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,321
But this is still what makes Jesus look like a free spirit on 154.

93
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:12,240
He says that the aphorism 31, I have anticipated my answer to the problem.

94
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,841
That is the problem of Jesus.

95
00:09:13,841 --> 00:09:21,041
Its presupposition is that the type of the Redeemer has been preserved to us only in a very distorted form.

96
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:25,280
So he's picturing his own view of what Jesus was doing and saying.

97
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:31,041
And then he's telling you, it's, boy, is that not what Paul, particularly Paul, turned it into.

98
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,281
But let's go on with what he thinks it is.

99
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,921
He again goes back to Dostoevsky at the bottom of 154.

100
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:54,641
That strange and sick world to which the Gospels introduces us, a world like that of the Russian novel, in which the ref in which refuse of society, neurosis, and childlike idiocy seem to have a rendezvous, must in any case have coarsened the type.

101
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:02,881
The first disciples in particular had to translate a being immensely immersed entirely in symbols and incomprehensibility.

102
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,240
That's complicated.

103
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,681
That says that Jesus was talking in parables.

104
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,561
Jesus was bringing in such a new world, being a a super free spirit, he's opening up a whole new world.

105
00:10:14,561 --> 00:10:22,880
I mean, there was the ancient world, there was the Hebrew world, pretty soon there's going to be the Christian world, but the Christian world isn't here yet, so at that point.

106
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:40,361
So Jesus has to talk in parables and symbols, and these are incomprehensible, naturally, to the disciples who are still have the only only the old vocabulary, and only the Hebrew world can make sense of this, which can't make sense of this.

107
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,520
So obviously they're going to get it wrong.

108
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:50,521
So Nietzsche's got an argument, which is an interesting argument, that it must be distorted, which we're going to read in Paul and in the Gospels.

109
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,041
They couldn't understand it.

110
00:10:52,040 --> 00:11:01,240
And every once in a while you see in the Gospels Jesus says things and the disciples say things, and you can see Jesus is exasperated because the disciples haven't understood anything.

111
00:11:02,841 --> 00:11:10,841
And that's because, I mean, Jesus sounds to them crazy, just as Markle sounds to everybody crazy.

112
00:11:10,841 --> 00:11:35,081
Remember, Markle is the Jesus figure in the book, childlike, sick with tuberculosis, brain fever, and saying utterly incomprehensible things, or pretty incomprehensible, not really because 2,000 years of Christianity have made them comprehensible, but saying the servants should wash the feet of their masters and saying we should love everything and everybody, even the birds.

113
00:11:35,081 --> 00:11:37,801
I don't think even Jesus said we should love the birds.

114
00:11:37,801 --> 00:11:38,040
St.

115
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,640
Francis said it, and Markle says it.

116
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,681
So let me go a little further, the bottom of 154.

117
00:11:46,681 --> 00:11:55,161
So they translate these incomprehensibilities into their own crudity in order to understand anything at all.

118
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:00,361
For them, such a type could not exist until it had been reduced to more familiar terms.

119
00:12:00,361 --> 00:12:02,201
That's all exactly what I'm saying.

120
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:03,880
And Nietzsche is absolutely right.

121
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,441
That's bound to be a problem.

122
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:16,760
But Jesus, you can glimmer through their incomprehension that Jesus is, as I said, against fixed moral laws.

123
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,000
That was the bottom of 156.

124
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:30,001
And a belief in, and then now look at the middle of 157.

125
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:47,041
He thinks that the Christians soon thought Jesus was talking about denial, about denying your sensuous side, your body, your impulses, the sins in your members, as Paul would put it, and so forth.

126
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,601
But he wasn't, according to Nietzsche.

127
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:53,441
He says denial is precisely what is totally impossible for him.

128
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:59,361
Dialectics are likewise lacking, so he's not going around making arguments like Socrates.

129
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:05,201
The idea is lacking that a faith, a truth, could be proved by reasons.

130
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:08,481
That's what Socrates thinks.

131
00:13:08,481 --> 00:13:10,481
That's what, according to my son, Buddhist, thinks.

132
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:20,081
Buddhists, at least his kind of Tibetan Buddhists, I get constantly bombarded with arguments that are supposed to convince me that the Buddhist way of looking at things is true.

133
00:13:20,081 --> 00:13:21,201
That's not Jesus.

134
00:13:21,441 --> 00:13:29,201
His proofs are inner lights, inner feelings of pleasure, self-affirmations, nothing but proofs by potency.

135
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:30,801
That is very Nietzschean.

136
00:13:30,801 --> 00:13:38,481
I mean, he thinks that Jesus thinks sort of power and joy is evidence that he's on the right track.

137
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:46,961
In effect, he's saying what Markle says, when Markle says that we're in paradise here and now if we would only see it.

138
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:52,721
That is exactly what Nietzsche is attributing to Jesus.

139
00:13:52,721 --> 00:14:11,640
If you look on 158 now, at the end of number 33, the profound instinct of how one would have to live in order to feel oneself in heaven, to feel oneself eternal, while in another condition, one by no means feels oneself in heaven.

140
00:14:11,961 --> 00:14:18,441
This alone is the psychological reality of redemption, a new way of living, not a new belief.

141
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:32,601
Well, that's complicated, but what that says is, like Markle, if you feel that you're in heaven here and now, that is, as Markle puts it, if you're in paradise here and now, if you'd only see it, then you are in paradise.

142
00:14:32,601 --> 00:14:44,601
And that's what Jesus was defending, not some other world, but a way of living in this world that turns it into paradise in heaven here and now.

143
00:14:44,601 --> 00:14:48,841
In other words, it's all gotten existentialized by Nietzsche.

144
00:14:48,841 --> 00:14:51,641
So one more on 159.

145
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,961
So he's going to talk about the notion of the Father and the Son.

146
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:12,280
So he says, I grant, about five lines down, in the word Son is expressed the entry into the collective feeling of the transfiguration of all things.

147
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:21,321
In that sense, Markle is like Jesus, who is the Son, not S-O-N, but S-U-N.

148
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:31,960
But remember, the idea is that Markle and Jesus manifest this new way of life, this loving way of life, and it enters the world that way.

149
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,120
The connectedness enters the world.

150
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:43,000
So in the word Father, this feeling itself, the feeling of perfection and eternity, I'm ashamed to recall what the church has made of this symbolism.

151
00:15:43,001 --> 00:15:57,201
So he's happy, Nietzsche, with some feeling of, if not an ocean of love quite, but some feeling of happiness here and now, power outside of the law, and so forth.

152
00:15:57,761 --> 00:16:04,321
And suffering doesn't play any role in his reconstruction of all this.

153
00:16:04,321 --> 00:16:07,361
So yet, okay, so far so good.

154
00:16:07,361 --> 00:16:08,801
Anybody want to protest?

155
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:14,321
I mean, you can protest that, boy, is this far from the Bible, but if I'd let you protest that, I should have.

156
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,481
Then I would give you Nietzsche's story I just did, but you can't expect the Bible to get it right.

157
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:25,920
It's too much a new world, a new sun, a new perspective, a new interpretation, a new everything for them to get it right.

158
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,841
So we have to get it right.

159
00:16:27,841 --> 00:16:31,520
Nietzsche is going to fix it by existentializing it.

160
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:33,361
But here's the next question.

161
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:35,760
But why is then he called a decadent?

162
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:43,521
So far, it looks like everything about him is the whole right.

163
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,601
Well, gee, I didn't read the crucial sentence.

164
00:16:45,601 --> 00:16:46,801
How peculiar.

165
00:16:46,801 --> 00:16:48,000
What happened here?

166
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:52,640
I mean, before we answer that, where is the, I'll find it in a minute.

167
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,440
Here we are.

168
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,880
The top of 163.

169
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,760
Oh, I was going to get there, but I'd rather read it right now.

170
00:16:59,281 --> 00:17:01,280
The middle of.

171
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,761
Yeah, the top of 163.

172
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,160
I resume.

173
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,561
I shall now relate the real history of Christianity.

174
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:15,601
The word Christianity is already a misunderstanding.

175
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:20,081
In reality, there has been only one Christian, and he died on the cross.

176
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:27,601
So we're talking about the one Christian who was a free spirit, but it all got changed.

177
00:17:27,601 --> 00:17:32,720
But back to, so what about what happened there?

178
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:40,841
That his dying on the cross was already a sign that, well, no, I better say something else.

179
00:17:40,841 --> 00:17:44,120
That Nietzsche doesn't tell you right off.

180
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,241
You have to figure it out.

181
00:17:45,241 --> 00:17:47,480
I want to know whether anybody can figure it out.

182
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:53,561
Given all that description of Jesus, what did he do wrong?

183
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,280
And it has to do with dying.

184
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,240
Anybody know?

185
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:04,601
Well, I think it's that he was meek.

186
00:18:04,601 --> 00:18:06,520
I mean, he should have fought back.

187
00:18:06,521 --> 00:18:08,921
He should have led a rebellion of freedom fighters.

188
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,041
Maybe he was trying to lead a rebellion of freedom fighters, I think.

189
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,120
But in any case, he didn't.

190
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,161
He was meek.

191
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,000
That was part of the problem.

192
00:18:17,001 --> 00:18:19,240
And he was compassionate.

193
00:18:19,241 --> 00:18:32,680
Now comes the real standoff between Nietzsche and all of the Christian view, even the very, very nearly right you that Jesus had.

194
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:45,480
And the big issue is: what do you do with the people who are weak and don't have the power to have brief habits, to constantly overcome, to turn against the ethics, to open new worlds?

195
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,321
What do you do with them?

196
00:18:47,321 --> 00:19:05,801
Well, it clearly, in Dostoevsky, somebody like Alyasha helps them, tries to prop them up and get them as near to being, and get them in touch with the love, and never mind that they're in touch with the love, they don't need any more strength than that.

197
00:19:05,801 --> 00:19:07,240
That'll do it.

198
00:19:07,241 --> 00:19:15,720
But Nietzsche, and now we have to look at 159, where you get a hint of this thing I'm telling you.

199
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,480
I didn't make it up completely.

200
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:24,001
And now we're at 35.

201
00:19:24,321 --> 00:19:29,201
This bringer of glad tidings, that's the Bible.

202
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:36,240
I mean, Nietzsche thinks that the glad tidings that Jesus had got turned into bad tidings by the followers.

203
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:39,841
But the bringer of glad tidings died as he lived.

204
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:49,760
Died as he lived, as he taught, not to redeem mankind, but to demonstrate how one ought to live.

205
00:19:49,761 --> 00:20:00,480
What he bequeathed to mankind in his practice, his bearing before the judges, before the guards, before the accusers, in every kind of calamity and mockery, his bearing on the cross.

206
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,520
Now comes the trouble.

207
00:20:01,521 --> 00:20:02,001
Sorry.

208
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,440
He does not resist.

209
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,361
He does not defend his rights.

210
00:20:05,361 --> 00:20:09,120
He takes no steps to avert the worst that can happen to him.

211
00:20:09,601 --> 00:20:17,280
Now, that kind of nonviolence, that kind of pacifism, boy, is that not a Nietzschean virtue.

212
00:20:17,281 --> 00:20:19,200
I mean, that's not life.

213
00:20:19,521 --> 00:20:21,680
That's not overcoming.

214
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:29,520
The best place to see more of that is in what he says.

215
00:20:29,841 --> 00:20:32,480
I thought I had it here, but I'm now wondering where.

216
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,920
We'll find out.

217
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:35,041
So.

218
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,000
Funny.

219
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:48,321
It's a very important quote where I guess we'll have to wait till we get to what I'm in my.

220
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,681
I would have put it here.

221
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,640
Just a second.

222
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,680
It's about life.

223
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:55,200
Here they are.

224
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,760
Let's look at 27 and 28 of Twilight.

225
00:21:02,001 --> 00:21:04,400
Well, no, 127.

226
00:21:05,281 --> 00:21:06,440
Try that.

227
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,720
You have to see how un Christian this is.

228
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:13,321
Ah, yeah, this is what I was looking for.

229
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,720
Starting at the bottom of 127.

230
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,361
Try this on, try this on.

231
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:19,720
Jesus.

232
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,760
What is good?

233
00:21:20,761 --> 00:21:25,241
All that heightens the feeling of power, the will to power, power itself in man.

234
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:26,041
What is bad?

235
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,800
All that proceeds from weakness.

236
00:21:27,801 --> 00:21:28,761
What is happiness?

237
00:21:28,761 --> 00:21:32,920
The feeling that power increases, that a resistance is overcome.

238
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:36,440
Now, then, not contentment, but more power.

239
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,841
Not peace at all, but war.

240
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:41,880
Not virtue, but proficiency.

241
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,361
Virtue in the Renaissance style.

242
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:46,841
The weak and ill-constituted.

243
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:52,760
Now, I mean, that's already sort of un Jesus un-Christian, but it gets extremer.

244
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:57,880
The weak and ill-constructed shall perish, first principle of our philosophy.

245
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,640
And one shall help them do so.

246
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,120
I mean, that's getting really the opposite.

247
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,520
I mean, so if you find weak people, the best thing you could do is sort of put them out of their misery.

248
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,640
What is more harmful than vice?

249
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,841
Active sympathy for the ill-constituted and weak.

250
00:22:12,841 --> 00:22:14,200
Christianity.

251
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:23,880
Well, that little bit of Christianity is enough, I take it, to disqualify Jesus as a free spirit.

252
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,241
Although he, except for that, he comes close.

253
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:37,400
There, he slips over into Dostoevsky-like compassion and connectedness, and Nietzsche doesn't believe in that.

254
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,241
Any questions about that?

255
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,001
Yeah.

256
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:54,801
Wait, we can somebody close the doors?

257
00:22:54,801 --> 00:22:58,161
I don't know about you guys, but I have trouble hearing because of the background noise.

258
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,280
Go ahead.

259
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:23,680
Well, probably, but you'll have to say it again because I couldn't hear it because of the background noise.

260
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,720
Try again.

261
00:23:46,081 --> 00:23:47,201
Yeah, it is.

262
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:55,841
No, what gives you power is healthy because it's life.

263
00:23:55,841 --> 00:24:01,440
Life is constantly getting more powerful, overcoming what you were.

264
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,041
He keeps talking like outgrowing, getting stronger.

265
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:08,160
And that's all life.

266
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:24,801
And Socrates' interest in truth doesn't give him power because it leaves him with this other world of truth that does in this world that he doesn't really wish he wasn't in this world, struggling, overcoming, and so forth.

267
00:24:24,801 --> 00:24:26,321
Have I understood you?

268
00:24:26,321 --> 00:24:27,361
Oh, okay.

269
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:29,601
So, anything else?

270
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,761
Nobody?

271
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:35,841
Oh, there's plenty of other issues, but if there is on this issue, I'm not going to.

272
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,520
This is all I have to say about this, but this is all he says about it.

273
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,640
Yeah.

274
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:49,561
Yes, I'm glad you asked.

275
00:24:49,561 --> 00:24:50,761
I'm glad you asked.

276
00:24:50,761 --> 00:24:56,200
Yes, but in a funny way, that you, I was discussing that with the TAs this morning.

277
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:04,761
It's true that up to the last minute of the movie, you can't tell whether he's got power and control of his life.

278
00:25:04,761 --> 00:25:12,680
He seems sort of to be, but he's sort of just, he's not getting anywhere, and he's running from the police and so forth.

279
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,521
But what is there about the last what?

280
00:25:14,521 --> 00:25:15,960
Well, it's about his death.

281
00:25:16,361 --> 00:25:26,680
He shows that he's not just a sort of anybody bounced around by forces that he doesn't control, and that his life is just out of control.

282
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,680
He takes control of his life completely in his death.

283
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:47,801
He, you know, I've said he runs to the crosswalk, he falls down, he takes his last puff, he throws away the cigarette, he gives her the three grimaces to show that this is terrific and he's doing it just right, and he dies, he closes his own eyes.

284
00:25:47,801 --> 00:25:49,321
I mean, that might be the last one.

285
00:25:49,321 --> 00:25:50,440
I didn't mention that.

286
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,761
He closes his own eyes and he dies.

287
00:25:52,920 --> 00:26:01,081
We couldn't have a more sort of joyous, positive, powerful, self-contained view of dying.

288
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:04,920
And then you could look back and say, if you're reading the film, I'm going to read it.

289
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,321
So, aha, he was really a free spirit all along.

290
00:26:07,321 --> 00:26:08,760
We couldn't tell for sure.

291
00:26:08,761 --> 00:26:10,281
But yet now we know.

292
00:26:10,321 --> 00:26:12,841
That's at least that's one way to read it.

293
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,081
Anything else?

294
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,361
Yeah.

295
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,520
Aha.

296
00:26:37,841 --> 00:26:39,120
Well, that's interesting.

297
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,481
I think you may have something there.

298
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,120
He does say he's tired of running from the police.

299
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:53,440
And he's very unhappy that she's not going to share his life his run to Italy.

300
00:26:54,561 --> 00:27:01,920
It it looks like, I don't know where this is going to lead, it looks like he wouldn't have given up if she had said, I'll go to Italy with you.

301
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:10,960
He would have kept the car and done a great chase all over Paris and left all the police cars in the ditches and went off to Italy.

302
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:17,760
So it's partly he's ready to live dangerously up to the point of death.

303
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:26,880
But it does look like this phrase when he says he's tired, that does show that he's not absolutely invincible power man.

304
00:27:27,761 --> 00:27:34,881
But I think we're supposed to think that that sort of with all those odds against him, the the police already are now his own girlfriend.

305
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,120
He's he was too much for him.

306
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,280
So he's certainly not the ultimate.

307
00:27:39,521 --> 00:27:43,760
He's a you remember he's a kind of pop punk, a punk free spirit.

308
00:27:44,321 --> 00:27:45,760
Anything else?

309
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,361
Yeah.

310
00:28:24,521 --> 00:28:25,241
That's good.

311
00:28:25,561 --> 00:28:27,001
That's what you were saying, I bet.

312
00:28:27,001 --> 00:28:31,160
I felt I didn't understand you, and I was surprised you agreed so easily.

313
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,681
You wanted to answer, Ian?

314
00:28:34,761 --> 00:28:36,601
Go ahead, you try.

315
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,440
Yes, that's right.

316
00:29:08,841 --> 00:29:17,081
That's the I give a cockta Escalapius is what he says, which means pay off the doctor for curing me.

317
00:29:17,081 --> 00:29:18,680
Right, which means dying.

318
00:29:19,321 --> 00:29:25,321
So in his case, okay, but I don't think you sort of described the problem, not the answer.

319
00:29:26,281 --> 00:29:41,081
What's wrong with the way Socrates relates to truth, in that it gives him a certain makes him, for instance, happy to make, and it makes him able to get everybody, get these his disciples to follow him.

320
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:47,321
And after all, Plato's the, if anybody wants a powerful follower, certainly Plato's terrific.

321
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,241
You want to get back into this discussion.

322
00:29:49,241 --> 00:29:49,801
You started it.

323
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:50,841
Go ahead.

324
00:30:05,761 --> 00:30:06,720
Let me try.

325
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:13,200
I think Nietzsche would say that it's the will to truth is fine as a means but not as an end.

326
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,720
And like convictions, you can use them.

327
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:24,321
Well, certainly criticism and mediation and truth are powerful things and you can use them.

328
00:30:24,321 --> 00:30:32,880
But if you make, I think the story is supposed to go, but if you make truth the end and not the means, you don't have any outgrowing to do.

329
00:30:33,281 --> 00:30:35,361
It's a static thing.

330
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,361
You achieve the truth.

331
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:39,040
It's the eternal truth.

332
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:40,800
It's the objective truth.

333
00:30:40,801 --> 00:30:42,561
It's sort of independent of you.

334
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,880
You don't have to, you know, two things.

335
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,400
You don't have to put in any particular work to make it true.

336
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:53,120
So it's not like Kierkegaard's subjective truth, that the princess is adorable.

337
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,000
The princess is adorable only if you adore her.

338
00:30:56,001 --> 00:30:59,680
There's a kind of truth that depends on your energy.

339
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:08,880
But Socrates' kind of objective truth is truth whether anybody knows it or not, like 2 plus 2 equals 4, or what justice is, or what courage is.

340
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,841
Since you haven't read much, Plato, Socrates, I don't want to go too much into examples.

341
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:26,000
But whatever it is, Socrates wants to find a truth that is fable and that doesn't require, doesn't depend in any way on him to preserve it.

342
00:31:26,001 --> 00:31:35,760
And therefore, it isn't the kind of outgrowing, power, always inventing new world story that he wants.

343
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:45,561
But I think what you're adding, and I think it's important, and I wasn't stressing it enough, both of you are onto it, mediation is okay as a means.

344
00:31:46,361 --> 00:31:48,120
It's a necessary means.

345
00:31:48,120 --> 00:32:05,000
I mean, if you didn't go through criticism so that you got rid of all your all the untruths and lies, that is, and distortions and superstitions that you have, you wouldn't be able to go on and be free spirit.

346
00:32:05,001 --> 00:32:10,120
So Socrates shouldn't have been given such a bad deal.

347
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,561
That's what's strange about it.

348
00:32:11,561 --> 00:32:15,160
I mean, there should have been more about the positive side of Socrates.

349
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,880
Not my fault.

350
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:17,641
I don't think I missed it.

351
00:32:17,641 --> 00:32:24,441
But he is, he just doesn't, in this, at that moment, want to give Socrates any credit at all.

352
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:35,241
And because he's so against the two things, that he doesn't have any heroic, noble instincts, and that he'd rather be dead than alive.

353
00:32:35,241 --> 00:32:44,041
But there is, now I'll see if I can jump to it, place for criticism and mediation.

354
00:32:44,361 --> 00:32:45,960
I think we'll have to wait till I get there.

355
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:51,001
It's someplace in the lecture, but if I go looking for it, I will just mess up things.

356
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,040
Okay.

357
00:32:54,281 --> 00:32:55,561
Then we'll go on.

358
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:59,801
So now we're ready for a whole more, yeah.

359
00:33:06,761 --> 00:33:08,040
Domino.

360
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,641
Yeah?

361
00:33:19,321 --> 00:33:22,040
I don't think it's like a big answer.

362
00:33:26,241 --> 00:33:50,800
He's not trying to advertise slave morality, but he's showing, but he certainly thinks that it doesn't matter whether you're a slave or not, every human being has innate ideas which are a vision of the truth that they had when their soul wasn't in their bodies, and the truth is there, eternal, independent of them, and anybody can be led to remember it.

363
00:33:50,801 --> 00:33:53,201
And he's showing how the slave boy remembers it.

364
00:33:53,201 --> 00:33:55,841
And it makes another reason, a point like I'm making.

365
00:33:55,841 --> 00:34:03,841
No passion is needed on his part or the slave boy part to make the Pythagorean theorem true, which is what they're discussing.

366
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:06,400
Yeah, yeah, it's way back to the first lecture.

367
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:15,201
It's objective truth that doesn't depend on us, and the more disinterested we are, the more we are able to discover it.

368
00:34:15,201 --> 00:34:18,080
Whereas Nietzsche has his own verse.

369
00:34:18,161 --> 00:34:27,841
Kierkegaard thinks the more passionate you are, the more you discover the important kind of truth, namely the princess is adorable or the black people must be given justice.

370
00:34:27,841 --> 00:34:33,201
And Nietzsche thinks that what?

371
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:47,760
Well, that you should be doing anything you can to be self-critical and discover the truth, but you should go, but you should use it as a means.

372
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,080
It's not a goal of the way of life going around objective, discovering objective truth.

373
00:34:54,080 --> 00:35:05,521
Being a theoretical person is, for Nietzsche, not a living, outgrowing, powerful way to be.

374
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:22,121
So Nietzsche, even more than Kierkegaard, is against objective truth, I think, because Kierkegaard's against it only because he thinks there's a higher truth, namely subjective truth.

375
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:28,521
Nietzsche thinks that, well, they both have in common.

376
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,760
It's okay, it's a good thing, as long as you don't make an end of it.

377
00:35:32,761 --> 00:35:35,240
It's a useful, power, even powerful means.

378
00:35:35,241 --> 00:35:36,920
I think they both think that.

379
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,160
I don't think Dostoevsky thinks it.

380
00:35:39,161 --> 00:35:40,761
He doesn't have much of a view of it.

381
00:35:40,761 --> 00:35:53,561
But if he had a view of it, it would be Yvonne, remember, who's the scientist and the philosopher, who does natural philosophy, which is something between science and philosophy when he's in the university.

382
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,761
And that doesn't seem to do Yvonne any good at all.

383
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,720
Philosophy is a kind of too detached.

384
00:35:59,721 --> 00:36:01,560
I mean, theory is too detached.

385
00:36:01,721 --> 00:36:03,880
Nothing is worse than being detached.

386
00:36:04,761 --> 00:36:07,560
It's a kind of curiosity, I think, of Dostoevsky.

387
00:36:07,641 --> 00:36:11,480
He doesn't see the power of theory, as far as I can see, at all.

388
00:36:11,801 --> 00:36:13,400
Okay, back to where I was.

389
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:26,761
We're in the ballpark of where I was, but there's an interesting abstract story going on between Nietzsche and Dostoevsky about something they have in common.

390
00:36:26,761 --> 00:36:31,960
And you'll see, but they diverge before the end of my explaining what they have in common.

391
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:40,121
But they start out with what Nietzsche would call a critique of metaphysical explanations.

392
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:45,641
That is, they've got a wrong view about causality.

393
00:36:45,960 --> 00:37:00,160
That means they think that there are these special powerful entities like the Supreme Being and eternity and the network of connectedness, which are real.

394
00:37:00,161 --> 00:37:01,120
They're metaphysical.

395
00:37:01,121 --> 00:37:02,641
They're ultimate reality.

396
00:37:02,641 --> 00:37:04,641
They're the way the universe is.

397
00:37:04,641 --> 00:37:16,321
And they think that on the basis of that, you can explain why people should love each other, get childhood memories, and so forth.

398
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:22,400
And according to Nietzsche and Dostoevsky, they really got things the wrong way.

399
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:38,880
That is, you don't explain the right way of the best way of living by bringing in metaphysical theological beings.

400
00:37:40,321 --> 00:37:47,121
Rather, you explain the best way of living is self-evident.

401
00:37:47,121 --> 00:37:53,121
And if anything is evidence of these other metaphysical things, it would be.

402
00:37:53,121 --> 00:37:54,240
But really, you don't need them.

403
00:37:54,241 --> 00:37:55,600
But this, I've jumped ahead.

404
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,720
I always shouldn't do that.

405
00:37:56,721 --> 00:37:58,240
It's not clear what I just said.

406
00:37:58,321 --> 00:37:59,920
I'll try to make it clear.

407
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:15,361
One way to see what's going on is that for Nietzsche and for Dostoevsky, religion really hasn't got to do with beliefs.

408
00:38:15,361 --> 00:38:27,040
That is, it hasn't got to do with beliefs about these metaphysical entities that in some way or another seem to justify religion.

409
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,521
This is all on page 163.

410
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,081
Lots of important things are going on.

411
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,841
So let's look at it.

412
00:38:36,721 --> 00:38:40,520
Starting about 15 lines down.

413
00:38:40,761 --> 00:38:45,561
Genuine primitive Christianity will be possible at all times.

414
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:51,561
That's a nice line, because Dostoevsky thinks he's got genuine primitive Christianity.

415
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,961
And I think probably Nietzsche agrees with him.

416
00:38:53,960 --> 00:39:00,201
And Markle and Alyasha show that genuine primitive Christianity is possible at all times.

417
00:39:00,201 --> 00:39:01,960
And that it's a pretty good thing.

418
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,641
It has a lot of elements of free-spiritedness in it.

419
00:39:05,641 --> 00:39:07,961
Although, finally, it's not.

420
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,960
But what they agree on now is that it's not a belief, but of doing.

421
00:39:12,121 --> 00:39:13,400
See where I'm reading.

422
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,080
Above all, it's, well, that's fine.

423
00:39:19,321 --> 00:39:21,320
Let's see what I want to say more about that.

424
00:39:21,321 --> 00:39:23,161
Let me just go on reading.

425
00:39:24,841 --> 00:39:38,361
States of consciousness, beliefs of any kind, holding something to be true, for example, every psychologist knows this, are a matter of complete indifference, of the fifth rank compared to the value of the instincts.

426
00:39:38,361 --> 00:39:44,041
To speak more strictly, the whole concept of spiritual causality is false.

427
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,721
That's what I was trying to say.

428
00:39:45,721 --> 00:39:53,241
When you bring in a supreme being, and that causes you to have belief in God, that's got it upside down.

429
00:39:53,241 --> 00:39:56,201
Now, I haven't proved that yet.

430
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:20,681
So if you think that because you believe, and oh, now comes another truth, that if you think that your beliefs are caused by the Supreme Being and all that, that's wrong.

431
00:40:20,681 --> 00:40:25,281
But if you also think that your beliefs are what save you, that's wrong.

432
00:40:25,761 --> 00:40:32,641
That nothing, anything that you, your beliefs don't do any good at all, and they don't cause anything.

433
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,240
Let me read what I wrote.

434
00:40:34,241 --> 00:40:49,521
If you think because you believe some truth about some ultimate reality, such as the Creator God, or that Christ died for our sins, or that God loves us, and therefore you'll be reborn, and so forth, you're mistaken.

435
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:55,121
Not that that's false, but that reverses the causality.

436
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:58,641
Whether that's true or false isn't the question.

437
00:40:58,641 --> 00:41:01,441
The question isn't about what you believe.

438
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,201
And now you should see the existentialist refrain coming.

439
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:09,121
It's what kind of life you live and whether it works.

440
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:11,920
That's the final test.

441
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:19,521
And that's not about whether any particular entities exist, although maybe you can figure that out from whether your life works.

442
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:28,641
But it isn't your beliefs that make you do what you do, and it isn't your beliefs that make your life work or don't work.

443
00:41:28,641 --> 00:41:30,240
It's how you act.

444
00:41:30,241 --> 00:41:32,241
So now we have to look at that more.

445
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:35,361
So we should look at page 64 of something.

446
00:41:35,361 --> 00:41:36,400
I wonder which.

447
00:41:36,721 --> 00:41:38,721
There's too many things around here.

448
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:49,761
Yeah, the top of 64 in Twilight.

449
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:54,801
Morality and religion fall entirely under the psychology of error.

450
00:41:54,801 --> 00:41:57,761
In every case, cause is mistaken for effect.

451
00:41:57,761 --> 00:42:02,161
Or the effect of what is believed true is mistaken for the truth.

452
00:42:02,161 --> 00:42:06,241
Or a state of consciousness is mistaken for the causation of the state.

453
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:12,920
That's all very obscure, I should think, to you yet, but he will explain it.

454
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:22,761
So, for instance, it turns out that it's the experience that matters.

455
00:42:22,761 --> 00:42:26,041
It doesn't matter that there has to be any cause behind it.

456
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,961
Take baptism.

457
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:41,960
It isn't that baptism is sort of magical and works because there's some kind of causality that when you get prayed over the right way or water put on you the right way, it will do something about your spiritual state.

458
00:42:42,281 --> 00:42:54,761
If baptism is true, it's because the experience you have, like Alyasha, of being held up to the icon, has an effect on how you act later in life.

459
00:42:54,761 --> 00:42:56,920
That's the basic thing.

460
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:01,801
And then you can say if you want, baptism is powerful, baptism is true, and so forth.

461
00:43:01,801 --> 00:43:03,961
But that's not the point.

462
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:10,041
The point is there are certain ways of acting that give you positive experiences.

463
00:43:10,361 --> 00:43:13,561
You don't need to ask what causes them.

464
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,841
Beliefs don't explain a way of life, I agree with you.

465
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,680
Let's look on 157.

466
00:43:18,681 --> 00:43:25,321
This is sort of hard, but if you go through it, you discover interesting similarities and differences.

467
00:43:38,681 --> 00:43:39,281
I don't see anything.

468
00:43:39,361 --> 00:43:40,600
No, 157.

469
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,441
What's on the bottom?

470
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,801
Oh, wait, which way?

471
00:43:45,801 --> 00:43:47,040
Are you in gay science or?

472
00:43:48,841 --> 00:43:50,361
Well, no, I'm looking there too.

473
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:51,480
I don't see it in the Antichrist.

474
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,040
The bottom of 157?

475
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,960
Ah, yeah.

476
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,961
Yes, that's right.

477
00:43:52,281 --> 00:43:59,361
That's it.

478
00:43:59,681 --> 00:44:01,281
That's what I was looking for.

479
00:44:01,281 --> 00:44:03,920
That it's not a belief which distinguishes the Christian.

480
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,120
The Christian acts.

481
00:44:05,121 --> 00:44:07,920
He is distinguished by a different mode of acting.

482
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,520
Neither by words nor heart.

483
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Does he resist so forth?

484
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,480
That's it.

485
00:44:12,641 --> 00:44:14,560
Then he doesn't resist the man who does him evil.

486
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,600
That's not the important thing.

487
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,920
We're doing the general thesis now.

488
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,601
Beliefs don't cause or explain any way of life.

489
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,161
I want to look just to see by coincidence if there's something about it here also.

490
00:44:26,161 --> 00:44:27,761
That would be peculiar.

491
00:44:27,761 --> 00:44:29,681
No, you're on the right track.

492
00:44:29,681 --> 00:44:36,801
So I noticed when I was thinking about this today that I don't think Alyosha has any beliefs about anything.

493
00:44:36,801 --> 00:44:38,400
He's the test case.

494
00:44:38,721 --> 00:44:41,281
He doesn't believe that there is a supreme being.

495
00:44:41,281 --> 00:44:43,761
He doesn't believe that baptism is necessary.

496
00:44:43,761 --> 00:44:46,321
He doesn't even believe in prayer, though he prays sometimes.

497
00:44:46,321 --> 00:44:48,721
It's a funny kind of prayer, you remember.

498
00:44:48,721 --> 00:44:56,561
He does it at night, and he sort of helps him collect his wits, and it helps him understand what's happening.

499
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:06,561
But he doesn't pray to God, the Supreme Being, because there isn't any in Brothers Karamatsa, there's the connectedness, and we can't pray to the connectedness.

500
00:45:08,641 --> 00:45:16,241
So whenever he does all sorts of things, but they don't follow from his belief about anything.

501
00:45:16,321 --> 00:45:18,640
And you keep your eyes open if you're looking at it again.

502
00:45:18,641 --> 00:45:38,441
And if anybody finds any evidence that Alyasha believes anything about religion and how to act in Christianity and sin and redemption and incarnation and resurrection, confession, and all the things that Dostoevsky writes about, if you think Alyasha has any beliefs about any of them, let me know.

503
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,480
I hope he doesn't.

504
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,521
I think he doesn't.

505
00:45:37,121 --> 00:45:47,161
For Dostoevsky, it's not a belief in connectedness that produces the experience of connectedness, just the reverse.

506
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:56,601
When we experience ourselves as part of the whole of connectedness and see we're accountable for everything, then we do believe it, but that's not important.

507
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,601
It changes our way of acting.

508
00:45:58,761 --> 00:46:01,241
Act like Alyasha or Zosima.

509
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:05,321
It's the experience that causes us to act that way.

510
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,681
And now comes the really interesting, complicated one.

511
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,441
If you experience eternity in time, then what about that?

512
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:24,361
Have you shown just by virtue of having the experience that there is eternity in time as possible?

513
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:26,281
What do you think?

514
00:46:27,241 --> 00:46:31,721
I think it's kind of tricky what I think you have to think.

515
00:46:32,201 --> 00:46:35,481
I don't think Dostoevsky actually says it.

516
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:39,720
Well, so dust is, so here's what's going to happen in this argument now for a minute.

517
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:44,361
So Nietzsche says, I don't care whether you believe in eternity in time or not.

518
00:46:44,361 --> 00:46:46,841
It's an experience, if there is one.

519
00:46:46,841 --> 00:46:51,480
And then Dostoevsky says, okay, good, I'll take that because I win.

520
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,560
I've described experiences in which there is eternity in time.

521
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:07,961
We get it when Alyasha gives the boys the childhood memories at the end of the book, which are going to keep them from becoming cynical and so forth later.

522
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:13,241
Well, what I think Nietzsche has to say first, anyway, is: well, we don't know yet.

523
00:47:13,241 --> 00:47:18,920
We won't know until they die whether those memories have lasted forever.

524
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,281
Maybe there isn't any.

525
00:47:20,201 --> 00:47:24,161
Maybe he hasn't given them any memories.

526
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:25,601
And maybe you never can.

527
00:47:27,121 --> 00:47:28,880
You outgrow them.

528
00:47:29,201 --> 00:47:37,920
Or the other thing Nietzsche will say is, okay, so he gives you, you get these memories, and you hold on to them for the rest of your life.

529
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,801
Does that show that there's eternity in time?

530
00:47:40,801 --> 00:47:43,121
No, that just shows you're sick and weak.

531
00:47:43,121 --> 00:47:47,201
If you were strong enough, you wouldn't need to keep those memories.

532
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:50,001
And they might not be the thing that makes you powerful.

533
00:47:50,000 --> 00:48:02,561
Maybe the boys at some point in life will come, some boy will come into a situation in which being cynical and laughing at the authorities, or laughing at the authorities, or whatever, is the right thing to do.

534
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:16,800
And maybe it will contradict what looks like the right way to live at the moment around the tombstone, around the church, the rock of Alicia.

535
00:48:17,121 --> 00:48:25,361
And the highest thing is to be adaptable, Nietzsche will say, not to have these experiences, even if you had an experience that lasted all your life.

536
00:48:26,241 --> 00:48:33,760
It would, at most, it would show there is something like forever and eternity in time, but it wouldn't show that forever and eternity in time is a good thing.

537
00:48:33,761 --> 00:48:36,081
Nietzsche's never going to admit that.

538
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:42,960
But they agree at least that if there is eternity in time, if there is a forever, it depends.

539
00:48:43,440 --> 00:49:08,441
The only evidence could be that there are people whose lives get that, whether through romantic love or any kind of unconditional commitment or a moment in which they're all together like the boys and having a special kind of revelation that you can have and it could control your life for the rest of your life.

540
00:49:07,281 --> 00:49:11,080
And but so you don't know who wins.

541
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:17,640
I mean all I can say is they agree that it's not a question of causality.

542
00:49:17,641 --> 00:49:20,280
It's not a question of objective belief.

543
00:49:20,281 --> 00:49:22,201
Is there eternity?

544
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,761
Can anything be forever?

545
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:27,161
That's a question of how people act.

546
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:32,121
Then there's a further question of the sort of value of having in your life something.

547
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:39,001
That's a different view, again, about how people act, how people should act.

548
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,600
But I'm not ready for that yet.

549
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,880
I really got ahead of the story.

550
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,840
Let's look at this.

551
00:49:43,241 --> 00:49:45,400
I'll give you another illustration.

552
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,681
What about if God is dead, all things are possible?

553
00:49:48,681 --> 00:49:51,081
Is that a causal claim?

554
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,880
Well, sort of.

555
00:49:56,121 --> 00:50:01,001
That is, but it should be based on experience.

556
00:50:01,721 --> 00:50:03,241
All this is sort of weird and tricky.

557
00:50:03,241 --> 00:50:06,761
And if you don't understand it, it's partly my fault, I suppose, but try.

558
00:50:06,761 --> 00:50:16,441
So it looks like you ought to ask yourself the question: well, is the statement, if God is dead, all things are possible, true or not?

559
00:50:16,761 --> 00:50:24,361
And the answer ought to be, it's not a question of objective fact, it's a question of how particular people are.

560
00:50:24,361 --> 00:50:29,960
And does anybody anywhere in Dostoevsky ever act as if all things are possible?

561
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,161
We've gone through this.

562
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:32,841
And the answer is no.

563
00:50:32,841 --> 00:50:47,641
In Crime and Punishment, in the Brothers Karamatsov, in all of Dostoevsky, it looks like the experience is that if you do something immoral, you will feel guilt.

564
00:50:47,641 --> 00:50:51,200
You won't get away with it, and that's the important.

565
00:50:50,201 --> 00:50:55,440
It sort of follows from that, that God isn't dead, but that's not the importance.

566
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,481
You've got to reverse the causality.

567
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:06,321
The question, the causal question to ask is: can you get away with murder, in effect?

568
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:12,081
And the answer is going to be found out by what people could do, get away with.

569
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:17,920
Okay, in the meantime, I have to put in a parenthesis here.

570
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,600
I've had time to see Match Point because you all told me to see Match Point.

571
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,281
He says, How many of you have seen Match Point?

572
00:51:23,281 --> 00:51:24,400
Almost everybody.

573
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,761
Okay, well, there's a sentence in it that you're going to help me remember who said it.

574
00:51:27,761 --> 00:51:43,201
But obviously, Match Point is on the side of Nietzsche against Dostoevsky, it taking back the claim that you can't just go around murdering people for your own convenience and feel okay about it and get away with it.

575
00:51:43,201 --> 00:51:51,441
Now, let's go through it because it's not as conclusive as Crimes and Misdemeanors, which you haven't seen, which it's a rerun.

576
00:51:51,440 --> 00:52:09,441
In Crimes and Misdemeanors, it's clear, one, that the guy who murders his mistress, but she's getting in the way, is first overcome by guilt, and then finally and tortured by the idea that he should go and confess, like in Crime and Punishment.

577
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,361
But he doesn't go and confess.

578
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,041
Finally, he feels better.

579
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:21,441
And we know that later in his life we see him back being a pillar of the community, respected by everybody, giving charities to everything.

580
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,880
And he doesn't seem to be tortured like the mysterious visitor.

581
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,961
He seems to just be okay.

582
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:34,961
Well, it's a rerun of that, except that we don't see what happens to, what's his name, Chris, what's the guy's name?

583
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,361
Wil Chris Wilson?

584
00:52:37,801 --> 00:52:38,600
Wilton.

585
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:50,361
I mean, we don't see what happened to Chris Wilton much later, but we do see him reading Crime and Punishment, and he does kill his girlfriend and an old lady, just like Risvelnikov kills the porn broker and an old lady.

586
00:52:50,361 --> 00:52:54,600
And it looks like, and now you have to help me, he feels terrible about it at first.

587
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:59,721
Don't we see him looking really sort of sickened by what he's done, or am I imagining?

588
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,521
After shooting the lady.

589
00:53:05,801 --> 00:53:07,001
Ah, okay.

590
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,880
So he feels guilty, but he did it.

591
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,320
And now when does he say?

592
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:17,400
My wife says he doesn't say it, but I swear he says, if I'm not caught and imprisoned, it shows that there's no meaning in the universe.

593
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,920
Did I make that up?

594
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:22,041
Did I hallucinate that?

595
00:53:26,201 --> 00:53:27,880
Oh, that's when he says it.

596
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,760
I mean, the challenge was, but who would he say it to?

597
00:53:30,761 --> 00:53:34,761
You can't say it to anybody, because they turn to you, and that's right, the ghosts come.

598
00:53:34,761 --> 00:53:41,640
And he says to the ghosts that if I get caught, then you'll turn out to be right.

599
00:53:41,641 --> 00:53:44,681
But if I don't get caught, it shows there's no meaning in the universe.

600
00:53:44,681 --> 00:53:46,200
And that's the crucial line.

601
00:53:46,201 --> 00:53:47,801
You're all supposed to know that.

602
00:53:47,801 --> 00:53:55,241
And that's because, and that's why we're showing him reading crime and punishment, because that's the line that takes back crime and punishment.

603
00:53:55,241 --> 00:54:03,241
Because it looks like, in this case, he's not going to confess, and he's not going to get, well, and we've discovered that he doesn't get caught.

604
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:17,400
And that means that the universe is not a moral order, and psychology, too, is not such that you can, and human psychology is not such that you can't just murder people and get away with it and feel okay about it.

605
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,920
He already feels okay about it, as far as I can tell, by the end of the movie.

606
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:25,680
Now, it's inconclusive, but it's not meant to be.

607
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:33,441
I mean, it could, like the case of Dan White, remember I said who killed Merrill Moscone, it took him two years before he killed himself.

608
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:46,481
But we don't get the impression at all, as far as I can see, that Chris Wilson is going to have a relapse and kill himself later once he's happily settled in his new family with his kids and his job and all of that.

609
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,640
He's just going to forget Nora, is that her name?

610
00:54:48,641 --> 00:54:49,841
Noah.

611
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:51,281
Something like that.

612
00:54:52,161 --> 00:54:53,920
Anyway, does anybody want to say any more about it?

613
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:58,400
Because you sort of put a new movie in the course, which is nice.

614
00:54:58,721 --> 00:55:02,640
And Woody Allen is certainly out to get Dostoevsky.

615
00:55:02,641 --> 00:55:04,801
I mean, it's funny to do it twice.

616
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:11,441
He really cares a lot about this, that people can forget awful crimes and just feel okay about it.

617
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:13,281
He's thinking of himself.

618
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,880
But in any case, anything?

619
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,201
Okay, well, I'm going back to this then.

620
00:55:21,841 --> 00:55:22,960
So where are we?

621
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,000
So it seems, just to sum up, that it was random chance.

622
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,040
It was sheer luck.

623
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,641
That's how it's set up.

624
00:55:28,641 --> 00:55:43,280
Just as Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky feared, Kierkegaard says: if the world is just a kind of chaos, in which, remember, people don't get, those who work don't get the bread, and it turns out just random, who that would be terrible.

625
00:55:43,281 --> 00:55:46,000
But luckily in the world of the spirit, it's okay.

626
00:55:46,321 --> 00:55:54,400
And Dostoevsky, through Yvonne, considers the possibility that it's just random chaos.

627
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,240
And he has his own arguments, that you can't get away with it.

628
00:55:58,241 --> 00:55:59,600
Yvonne is his argument.

629
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:04,641
It's not okay to just decide to kill your father.

630
00:56:05,761 --> 00:56:11,560
But it looks like for Woody Allen, Nietzsche's right.

631
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:12,920
The world is just chaos.

632
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:19,561
It's sheer random whether you get away with murder or not, or and whether you feel bad about it or not.

633
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:24,361
And that's got to do with this causality issue.

634
00:56:24,361 --> 00:56:34,201
So now the question is: the question whether God is dead is not a metaphysical question about some entity and whether that entity is still around or not, this supreme being.

635
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:42,761
It turns into an existentialized question: can you live as if there were no God and all things were possible?

636
00:56:42,761 --> 00:56:43,961
Or can't you?

637
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,281
And Dusty S says you can't.

638
00:56:46,281 --> 00:56:48,361
And Nietzsche says, yes, you can.

639
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,600
Woody Allen agrees with Nietzsche.

640
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,760
But the causality is reversed.

641
00:56:53,400 --> 00:57:07,481
Once you say that you discover you can't live without feeling guilt, finally sort of falling apart after you killed your girlfriend, then you can use that as an argument for the existence of God.

642
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,400
But that's the other way around.

643
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:14,761
See, you don't feel bad because you believe in the existence of God, and therefore you feel guilty.

644
00:57:14,761 --> 00:57:21,241
If you feel guilty for these people who have reversed the causality, that will be an argument for the existence of God.

645
00:57:21,241 --> 00:57:26,040
But that's not important, the argument for the existence of God, whether you believe in God.

646
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,920
The question is whether you feel guilty or not.

647
00:57:29,721 --> 00:57:30,681
You understand?

648
00:57:30,681 --> 00:57:33,001
You're looking all baffled.

649
00:57:33,321 --> 00:57:34,281
Okay, I'm going to go on.

650
00:57:34,281 --> 00:57:36,121
Maybe it'll unbaffle you.

651
00:57:36,121 --> 00:57:40,600
Unless somebody wants to ask a question, explain to me why you're all looking so bad.

652
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,241
Yeah.

653
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,000
Wow, that's great.

654
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,281
Wouldn't that be a neat exam call?

655
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,641
We don't have that kind of exam question, unfortunately.

656
00:57:58,241 --> 00:58:01,361
But maybe we will someday have to think about that.

657
00:58:01,361 --> 00:58:04,161
I mean, let's just spell out what they mean.

658
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:22,880
Remember, for Kierkegaard, God is that all things are possible means that, not that you can just do any old thing in ethics, because he believes that ethics is based in, well, he has two views about ethics.

659
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:38,481
Either it's based in what counts as good in the community and is intelligible to the people in the community, that would be Hegel's view, or that there is, it looks like sometimes, an absolute ethics, there is a right and wrong, which would be Kant's view.

660
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:45,121
So, and yet he believes that, as you say, and I keep saying, God is that all things are possible.

661
00:58:45,121 --> 00:58:49,041
Well, he doesn't mean all actions.

662
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:55,200
There are just some moral actions that you can do and you should do and other moral actions you shouldn't do.

663
00:58:55,201 --> 00:58:57,920
So, what does he mean, all things are possible?

664
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:04,321
Well, he means, remember, that Abraham could somehow kill Isaac and still have Isaac.

665
00:59:04,321 --> 00:59:15,201
Or that you can teleologically suspend the ethical and yet you can be doing your ethical duty, even though you can't explain to yourself or anybody else how you could be doing your ethical duty by doing this awful thing.

666
00:59:15,201 --> 00:59:31,041
So, it's specific impossibilities that if you're a moral person and a sensible person, certain things will be impossible for you.

667
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:45,641
Like, let's take the two extreme cases, like living, like getting more and more involved with somebody or some cause and taking this incredible risk that it can throw you into grief.

668
00:59:45,641 --> 00:59:52,201
It looks impossible to see the sword hanging over the head of the beloved and live as if it's the surest thing of all.

669
00:59:52,201 --> 01:00:05,880
That's the sense that if you believe, but if you believe that God, for God, all things are possible, you can get more and more involved with the beloved, see the sword hanging over the head, and go on getting involved.

670
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:13,241
That's what, because for God, that crazy way of acting is okay.

671
01:00:13,241 --> 01:00:19,480
And of course, it turns out to be okay because in grief you can interiorize and so forth, but that's not important.

672
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,680
You can't say that to yourself.

673
01:00:20,681 --> 01:00:23,321
You can't say, oh, I'll get more and more involved with Mary after all.

674
01:00:23,321 --> 01:00:26,761
If she dies and I go through grief, I'll marry somebody else.

675
01:00:26,761 --> 01:00:28,120
It doesn't look that way.

676
01:00:28,121 --> 01:00:33,400
From inside, it looks very risky and terribly threatening.

677
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:40,521
And yet, now we're back, because God is all things are possible, a knight of faith can do it.

678
01:00:41,480 --> 01:01:02,681
And the endesteriological suspension example to keep in mind, remember, is if you're a homosexual in 1850 Copenhagen and it looks like anything you have a lover of the same sex, and this is absolutely disgusting and awful and depraved and sick and all that, it still can look to you as if it's the best thing you ever did.

679
01:01:02,681 --> 01:01:04,040
But that makes no sense.

680
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,561
That's absurd.

681
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,801
That's paradoxical.

682
01:01:07,801 --> 01:01:11,160
But you can do it because for God, all things are possible.

683
01:01:11,161 --> 01:01:13,880
Maybe the crucial, I'm trying to figure out how to sum this up.

684
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:17,321
For God, even the impossible is possible.

685
01:01:17,321 --> 01:01:18,600
That's the way to put it.

686
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,201
That's the paradoxical occurrence.

687
01:01:21,201 --> 01:01:25,601
It isn't that all actions are equally okay.

688
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:30,321
That gets us to Dostoevsky and Yvonne and so forth.

689
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:40,801
If God is dead, all things are possible means that if there's no basis for the moral order in the universe, all actions are equally okay.

690
01:01:40,801 --> 01:01:43,760
Those are just two completely different stories.

691
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:45,920
Have I finally nailed it down?

692
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:46,801
I think so.

693
01:01:46,801 --> 01:01:54,161
So in one case, the impossible is the unthinkable, in the sense of paradoxical, incomprehensible.

694
01:01:54,161 --> 01:01:57,281
I'm going to kill my son, and yet he's not going to be dead.

695
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:00,720
And that's Kierkegaard.

696
01:02:00,721 --> 01:02:04,880
On the other hand, if God is dead, all things are possible.

697
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,481
That means if God is dead, you can do all anything you please.

698
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,521
You just know there's no punishment.

699
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,880
There's no moral law.

700
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,160
There's no moral order.

701
01:02:14,161 --> 01:02:16,161
That's just a totally different story.

702
01:02:16,161 --> 01:02:22,640
And all you can say is they sound the same, but if you put them in the context they are saying, they're not even saying opposed things.

703
01:02:22,641 --> 01:02:25,041
They're just saying totally different things.

704
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,640
I hope that helped.

705
01:02:26,641 --> 01:02:27,120
I don't know.

706
01:02:27,121 --> 01:02:27,920
Did it help?

707
01:02:33,201 --> 01:02:34,241
Thinkable.

708
01:02:34,241 --> 01:02:41,041
Yeah, Osaba, ethical permissibility versus thinkability, that is conceivability.

709
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:47,761
Yeah, when Kierkegaard says all things are possible, he means even the inconceivable can happen.

710
01:02:47,761 --> 01:02:49,361
That's the absurd.

711
01:02:50,241 --> 01:03:00,000
When Nietzsche and Dostoevsky argue about whether when God is dead, all things are possible, they are talking about whether all actions are morally permissible.

712
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,321
And that's just another issue.

713
01:03:02,321 --> 01:03:03,920
Okay, I saw another hand.

714
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:04,720
Didn't know.

715
01:03:04,721 --> 01:03:05,521
Yes.

716
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:40,680
Ah, interesting.

717
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,361
Uh-huh.

718
01:03:42,681 --> 01:03:43,880
It is in a way.

719
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:44,361
Yeah?

720
01:03:44,361 --> 01:03:45,961
These are good questions.

721
01:03:48,761 --> 01:03:51,960
Dostoevsky would have liked a lot of things about careful government.

722
01:03:51,960 --> 01:04:04,201
Remember, subjective truth, he would have liked, that is, that something is true for you insofar as you're absolutely committed to it, and as long as you're committed to it, he just would have said it was, you shouldn't get stuck in it.

723
01:04:04,201 --> 01:04:04,920
We'll get to that.

724
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,761
But let's stick to what you said.

725
01:04:06,761 --> 01:04:09,161
So, live dangerous.

726
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,841
You want to say something about that?

727
01:04:13,161 --> 01:04:14,041
Good.

728
01:04:36,361 --> 01:04:37,960
No, I mean, not the way.

729
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:44,681
Although, if you hear it a certain way, because Nietzsche says you should use commitments, but you shouldn't get stuck in them.

730
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:49,560
Well, okay, but that's a different issue.

731
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:54,481
But I put nothing wrong with what you said, but it isn't going to help him, me answer him.

732
01:04:54,801 --> 01:04:57,200
There are two different ways of living dangerously.

733
01:04:57,201 --> 01:04:58,400
That's the issue.

734
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,761
Just as there were two different meanings of all things that are possible.

735
01:05:01,761 --> 01:05:09,121
Now, when you live dangerously in Kierkegaard, you certainly do see the sword hanging over the head of the beloved.

736
01:05:09,121 --> 01:05:18,000
But if you're a knight of faith, you find you do it as if it's the surest thing of all.

737
01:05:18,321 --> 01:05:22,321
So it's a funny kind of dangerous.

738
01:05:22,321 --> 01:05:24,160
It does have a certain kind of dangerous.

739
01:05:24,161 --> 01:05:26,880
He says it's like swimming over 50,000 fathoms.

740
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:33,841
I mean, there's nothing to support it, and it could fall, you know, it's vulnerable, this relationship or whatever.

741
01:05:33,841 --> 01:05:36,161
It could disappear at any minute.

742
01:05:36,161 --> 01:05:46,801
But if you're a knight of faith, you know that to talk now like Dostoevsky talking about Alyasha, you act as if in everything you do that nothing could hurt you.

743
01:05:46,801 --> 01:05:52,641
Because Aliyasha has that kind of faith, and so does the Knight of Faith have that kind of faith.

744
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:07,281
Yeah, well, no, no, I think it really is risky and dangerous, even to you, that you will lose this loved person.

745
01:06:07,281 --> 01:06:17,201
But you have this paradoxical, remember, not rational belief, and it doesn't matter whether it's a belief, because you can't really believe a paradox.

746
01:06:17,201 --> 01:06:33,840
You have this completely absurd, unthinkable way of acting in which you are both taking this complete risk and living dangerously, and living as if it's the surest thing of all, not dangerously.

747
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:40,680
The free spirit isn't, I mean, the light of faith is not really risking anything.

748
01:06:41,881 --> 01:06:48,760
But the knight of faith can only do that because they live in this field of faith that all things are possible.

749
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,081
Otherwise, it would be dangerous.

750
01:06:51,081 --> 01:06:56,120
And then you get the knight of resignation, who doesn't want to live dangerously.

751
01:06:56,600 --> 01:07:06,281
Trying to put into an eternal, secure relationship to an idea that you can't die or go away.

752
01:07:09,321 --> 01:07:12,600
The knight of resignation doesn't live dangerously at all.

753
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:15,480
They want to be peaceful and secure.

754
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:18,840
The knight of faith isn't peaceful and secure.

755
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:23,960
They have to constantly live in an absurdity they can't understand.

756
01:07:24,281 --> 01:07:39,560
But it's not the same kind of living dangerously as building your house on the slopes of Vesuvius, where you know that you are living in Berkeley, where you know that an earthquake of nine is supposed to happen somewhere in the next 30 years.

757
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:41,960
I mean, that's a different way of living dangerously.

758
01:07:42,041 --> 01:07:46,920
That's something bad that can actually happen to you and be devastating.

759
01:07:46,921 --> 01:07:52,680
And you've got no backup that you, that, that no matter what happens, it'll be okay.

760
01:07:52,921 --> 01:07:59,160
Nietzsche thinks you have to really take the risk, but there are bad things that can happen to you and it won't be okay.

761
01:07:59,161 --> 01:08:04,920
Your loved one won't be returned to you even though they died or you failed them.

762
01:08:04,921 --> 01:08:09,321
And if you Vesuvius erupt, you had it.

763
01:08:09,321 --> 01:08:11,000
So I think that's the point.

764
01:08:10,961 --> 01:08:17,400
I mean, there's a kind of peculiar, absurd protection in Kierkegaard's Christianity.

765
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:23,120
But he's as close as you can get, because he, let's faith something like live strenuously.

766
01:08:23,121 --> 01:08:24,560
They both have.

767
01:08:22,281 --> 01:08:29,440
That is, that's this swimming over 40,000 fathoms.

768
01:08:30,001 --> 01:08:36,720
And that goes back to Pascal, who thinks that you have to live constantly anxiously to get Christian.

769
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,880
Remember, anxiety is the ultimate test of whether you're not.

770
01:08:41,281 --> 01:08:52,640
But anxiety isn't the same courage to go on doing all kinds of dangerous things, knowing full well that something very bad might happen, period.

771
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,241
Okay, that's the best I can do with that.

772
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:55,440
They're good questions.

773
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,361
I think the questions are better than the answers.

774
01:08:58,081 --> 01:09:00,960
I have a feeling there ought to be a decayer thing to take.

775
01:09:00,961 --> 01:09:03,281
But they don't confront each other, these funny questions.

776
01:09:03,281 --> 01:09:08,400
They come at each other from different angles so that they don't really meet head on.

777
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,760
Each in a context has its own sense.

778
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:16,000
Okay, let me see where we are so I can find out where we should stop.

779
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,281
I'm going to just summarize maybe.

780
01:09:21,281 --> 01:09:29,440
Dostoevsky and Nietzsche agree that religion is not a matter of belief and not based on belief in metaphysical and theological realities.

781
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,361
That gets the causality reversed.

782
01:09:31,361 --> 01:09:34,000
What matters is religious experience.

783
01:09:34,001 --> 01:09:37,361
But now comes the big thing we've been saying, but let's just sum it up.

784
01:09:37,361 --> 01:09:44,560
But they have a totally different view of the religious experience that is the crucial question.

785
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:57,361
Nietzsche's against all versions of the Christian religious, except Jesus, which is only lasts until he's taken down from the cross.

786
01:09:57,361 --> 01:10:10,520
So Nietzsche's against all versions of Christian experience, even if it's based on revelations, as it is in Dostoevsky, like Alyasha's experience of the connectedness of everything.

787
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:15,241
And how does he criticize Dostoevsky?

788
01:10:15,241 --> 01:10:16,440
I'll just stop with that.

789
01:10:17,321 --> 01:10:21,160
There's this funny critique, again, as if maybe he's been reading the brothers.

790
01:10:21,161 --> 01:10:24,440
Dostoevsky says, look, there's a connectedness of everything.

791
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:25,321
How do we know?

792
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:32,361
Well, Alyasha has an experience of it when he goes and throws himself on the ground and feels connected to all the worlds.

793
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:36,201
And Nietzsche answers at the top of 178.

794
01:10:37,161 --> 01:10:43,160
Christianity has made a great contribution and taught moral skepticism trenchantly and effectively.

795
01:10:43,161 --> 01:10:46,520
Now, the skepticism issue is what I want to talk about.

796
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:53,560
On page 185 now of Twilight, he seems to be, I think, let's hope that that's it.

797
01:11:00,281 --> 01:11:01,321
No, not what I want.

798
01:11:01,321 --> 01:11:02,680
Let's see if I can find it.

799
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:06,040
Ah, 253 of the gay science.

800
01:11:06,041 --> 01:11:07,321
That's it.

801
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:15,160
He says, you can have what look like religious experiences, but they really grow out of your needs.

802
01:11:15,161 --> 01:11:16,361
You fool yourself.

803
01:11:16,361 --> 01:11:19,241
And that Christianity has taught us not to fool.

804
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,400
At first, it taught people how to fool themselves.

805
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,480
That's sort of what the Grand Inquisitor did.

806
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:29,000
But then Christianity, being so critical and skeptical, taught people out of it.

807
01:11:29,001 --> 01:11:34,920
So I'm just going to read this, stop by reading on 253, number 319.

808
01:11:34,921 --> 01:11:39,640
One sort of honesty has been alien to all founders of religion and their kind.

809
01:11:40,361 --> 01:11:43,960
Christianity finally gets it, but not the founders.

810
01:11:43,961 --> 01:11:47,720
They have never made their experience a matter of conscience for knowledge.

811
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,081
What did I experience?

812
01:11:49,081 --> 01:11:51,241
What happened in me and around me at the time?

813
01:11:51,241 --> 01:11:52,880
Was my reason brightened up?

814
01:11:52,881 --> 01:11:58,160
Was my will opposed to all deceptions of the senses and bold in resisting the fantastic?

815
01:11:58,161 --> 01:11:59,760
None of them have asked such questions.

816
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:00,800
Now look at this.

817
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:05,281
On the contrary, they thirst after things that go against reason.

818
01:12:05,281 --> 01:12:07,520
They don't want to be too hard on themselves.

819
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:13,840
So they experience miracles, rebirths, and hear the voices of the little angels.

820
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:22,321
Well, I mean, probably he hasn't read Alyasha's experience, but what he would say is: well, Alyasha was frantic to have a miracle.

821
01:12:22,321 --> 01:12:26,321
He was just, he hadn't eaten and he hadn't slept for days.

822
01:12:26,321 --> 01:12:35,040
He's sort of just wishing with all his might that there would be some sign that there would be a miracle.

823
01:12:35,041 --> 01:12:44,960
And then he goes to Zosima, sorry, to Gushenka, and he experiences this miracle, and he views it as a miracle and as a rebirth.

824
01:12:44,961 --> 01:12:49,840
And then he falls on the ground and he has this experience of everything being connected to everything.

825
01:12:49,840 --> 01:13:01,120
But he doesn't ask himself, gee, isn't it funny that it happened after two nights, let's say, of no sleep, and that I was very hungry and that I was absolutely desperate to get in touch with some religious something or other.

826
01:13:01,121 --> 01:13:02,960
He's just happy to have it.

827
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:07,600
Well, Dostoevsky would say, well, I told you sort of all there is to tell about it.

828
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:13,600
He really had it, and it really gave him a connection to this ultimate order.

829
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:27,440
But Nietzsche would just say, well, you certainly didn't tell us how that he had it when a lucid day after a good night's sleep at noon in broad daylight, after several cups of coffee, he felt connected to everything.

830
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,760
I mean, that would really convince Nietzsche.

831
01:13:30,321 --> 01:13:36,160
But not falling on, not on a warm autumn night when he was desperate.

832
01:13:36,161 --> 01:13:38,440
Okay, so let me see now.

833
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:45,321
So, finally, then, on, I'm just going to, this just finishes it.

834
01:13:45,321 --> 01:13:49,400
So, a weak person can't be honest, he says on 185.

835
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:50,760
I'll stop with that.

836
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:54,120
About 15 lines down.

837
01:13:54,121 --> 01:14:04,520
Not to see many things, not to be impartial in things, to be party through and through, to view all values from a necessary perspective.

838
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:07,560
This alone is the condition under which such a man exists.

839
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,241
That is, a weak person.

840
01:14:09,241 --> 01:14:14,920
That he is thereby the antithesis, the antagonist of the truthful man, of truth.

841
01:14:14,921 --> 01:14:18,840
The believer is not free to have a conscience at all over the question of true and false.

842
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:22,440
To be honest on this point could mean his immediate destruction.

843
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:29,000
The pathological conditionality of his perspective makes the convinced man a fanatic.

844
01:14:29,001 --> 01:14:39,081
Okay, so he's going to say that the trouble is that people get the, it's out of their needs that they get their experiences, therefore I don't believe them.

845
01:14:39,081 --> 01:14:40,520
One last comment.

846
01:14:41,961 --> 01:14:43,241
What page was I just reading?

847
01:14:43,241 --> 01:14:46,201
I was reading 185 of the Antichrist.

848
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:49,640
And I'll start with that issue again next time.

849
01:14:50,201 --> 01:14:55,241
Bring the Antichrist as well as the gay science.

850
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,120
Sure.

851
01:14:56,121 --> 01:14:57,161
Next time.

852
01:14:57,881 --> 01:14:58,520
Okay.
