1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
I'm going to talk about problems one and two now.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,400
And that's what you should read for next week in Fear and Trembling.

3
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:25,760
Put it over here.

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,320
Problems one and two, they go together.

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,840
They're both about the relation of Abraham to the ethical.

6
00:00:36,081 --> 00:00:41,200
He's clearly doing something unethical when he's going to go out and kill his son.

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:53,921
And now I have to tell you just one thing you need to know in order to read it, which hasn't seemed to have confused anybody of the writers who write about it or anything I've ever read about fear and trembling.

8
00:00:53,921 --> 00:01:01,200
But there's one important switch, which, if you're reading it at all carefully, it would drive you crazy.

9
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,121
In the preamble from the heart, Isaac is Abraham's defining commitment.

10
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:15,720
It's through Isaac that he becomes the father, will become the father of the people, and that's who he thinks he is.

11
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:21,720
But when you do problem one and two, you switch, and Isaac becomes the ethical.

12
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:25,241
And killing Isaac means going against the ethical.

13
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:27,880
In problem one, anything could happen to Isaac.

14
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:29,721
It wouldn't have to be Abraham's fault.

15
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:38,121
It's about what happens when the relation becomes impossible, when you can't carry out what it is that was going to define you.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,161
But in the problem, that's in the preamble from the heart.

17
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:50,761
In problem one and two, it becomes strictly a question of when you kill Isaac, you break the moral law.

18
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,520
What about that, Abraham?

19
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,520
Just bear that in mind.

20
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:01,881
Now, we're ready to go to Hiroshima one more, which is for the rest of the time, and it'll take all the time.

21
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,361
It's a complicated movie.

22
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:20,760
So, from the very beginning, and literally the very beginning, the first line, it's already incomprehensible in a way that you won't really understand, you're not supposed to understand, until way later in the movie.

23
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:35,481
But it begins, besides the pictures of the bodies, which is supposed to just get you into the sense of, she says, there's lots of comments in the scenario by Marguerite Burger, what she's trying to do.

24
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:50,921
And she says about this: the main thing is that we get the feeling that this dew, like dew on the bodies, this perspiration has been deposited by the atomic mushroom, and it should produce a violent, conflicting feeling of freshness and desire.

25
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,281
I don't know whether it did in you.

26
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:59,281
I didn't see much freshness, but it doesn't make any difference for what happens next.

27
00:02:59,281 --> 00:03:17,041
What happens next is though the bodies are there moving around, these voices of the man and the woman were obviously not speaking right then because it would be a pretty weird way of making love to be carrying on this sort of detached philosophical conversation at the same time.

28
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:21,520
But it's sort of what they're thinking or what they stand for.

29
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,921
I don't quite know what it is.

30
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:31,041
But what he says is, first sentence, you saw nothing in Hiroshima, nothing.

31
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:38,880
And she says, in a voice that's flat and monotonous, like she was reciting something.

32
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,720
That's what the directions say.

33
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,640
I saw everything.

34
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,840
Everything.

35
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:49,200
And then they repeat it, I mean, that's very mysterious.

36
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:51,041
We'll talk about it more in a minute.

37
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,960
They repeat it with variations.

38
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:59,280
She says, I'll give you page numbers in the scenario so that if you decide to look these things up, you'll know where they are.

39
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,000
She says, I know everything.

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,760
And he says, nothing.

41
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,440
You know nothing.

42
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:12,401
And finally, and most important of all, they get into the same kind of discussion about memory and forgetting.

43
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,561
She says, like you, this is 22 bottom.

44
00:04:16,561 --> 00:04:18,801
Like you, I know what it is to forget.

45
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,441
And he says, no, you don't know what it is to forget.

46
00:04:21,441 --> 00:04:23,121
She says, like you, I have a memory.

47
00:04:23,121 --> 00:04:24,641
I know what it is to forget.

48
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,041
And he says, no, you don't have a memory.

49
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,441
Well, that's all pretty amazing.

50
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,841
And the first thing to ask is, well, what do you normally think?

51
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:36,560
You hear that, and you make sense of it.

52
00:04:36,561 --> 00:04:37,960
What sense did you make of it?

53
00:04:38,121 --> 00:04:41,481
At this point, there's a certain way you ought to understand it.

54
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:48,121
When just the simplest one, when he says, You saw nothing in Hiroshima, and she says, I saw everything.

55
00:04:48,441 --> 00:04:52,441
Or you understood nothing, and she says, I understood everything.

56
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,201
How do you hear that?

57
00:04:54,201 --> 00:04:56,760
Somebody tell me, just to make sure you're with it.

58
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,481
There's a perfectly sensible way to understand what they must be disagreeing about.

59
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,601
Yeah?

60
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,761
No?

61
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:07,880
Come on, somebody must.

62
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,441
Yeah.

63
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:12,680
That's right.

64
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,160
Perfect.

65
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,760
Yeah, surely all of you thought that.

66
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,201
Otherwise, I get worried.

67
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,281
But you think, gee, well, of course, she thinks she's seen it.

68
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,881
She's been to the museum and she's read about it and she's thought about it.

69
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,721
She thinks she understands it altogether.

70
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:27,000
And he's saying, no, you don't.

71
00:05:27,481 --> 00:05:30,441
I've been through the total destruction of my world.

72
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:41,321
We find out later that his family, and that could have means his mother and father and brothers and sisters, but also his wife and children, everything was destroyed except him because he wasn't in Hiroshima.

73
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:42,920
He says he was out in the army.

74
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:52,201
Anyway, so he certainly must have experienced a lot, you would think, that she didn't understand and that she shouldn't even be claiming to understand.

75
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,361
And that's what you think first.

76
00:05:55,241 --> 00:06:03,321
And that's how it sounds when they discuss it on page 18.

77
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,920
She says, I've always wept over the fate of Hiroshima.

78
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,801
Always.

79
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,081
And he says, no, what would you have cried about?

80
00:06:11,081 --> 00:06:12,600
I mean, after all, I thought she didn't live there.

81
00:06:12,601 --> 00:06:14,281
Her family wasn't killed there.

82
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,481
That's what he's saying.

83
00:06:15,481 --> 00:06:17,000
And that sounds right.

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,681
And he's, I don't know, just to give you the pages, he's lost everything there.

85
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,081
It was a world-destroying disaster for him.

86
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,721
Whatever gave him his identity and whatever gave him a sense of what was important, whatever is wiped out.

87
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:32,721
You hear that on 29.

88
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,440
He says, were you at Hiroshima?

89
00:06:35,441 --> 00:06:37,280
He, no, of course I wasn't.

90
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,081
Then she says, oh, yeah, how stupid of me.

91
00:06:40,081 --> 00:06:42,721
He says, but my family was at Hiroshima.

92
00:06:42,721 --> 00:06:44,721
I was off fighting the war.

93
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:46,880
She, a stroke of luck, eh?

94
00:06:47,201 --> 00:06:54,321
And then the interesting thing, he looks at her long time, weighing the pros and cons, and says, yes.

95
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:58,561
I mean, why wasn't he just saying, yeah, sure, it was terrific.

96
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:03,921
Well, when your world is destroyed, it's not a big, and maybe you'd rather be dead too.

97
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:18,081
And so it isn't obvious at all that, but that just reinforces that he had suffered such a total disaster that he wasn't even sure whether it was better to be alive or dead after that.

98
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,400
And he sounds right, as he just said.

99
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,760
And I hope you agree.

100
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,321
The French woman can't understand all that.

101
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:30,161
She hasn't had her whole family wiped out and so forth.

102
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,361
And yet, and now it begins to be interesting.

103
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:45,040
What could she mean when she says that she understood it, she remembered it, she understood, what's the first sentence you saw?

104
00:07:45,361 --> 00:07:46,641
She's seen it.

105
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:48,801
She says, I saw everything.

106
00:07:49,121 --> 00:07:50,000
What could she mean?

107
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,801
Yeah.

108
00:07:52,081 --> 00:08:02,081
Well, but I haven't thought of inviting writing it from her own experiences, although, you have girls very handy, uh, the world's not having skills.

109
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:07,161
She had lost exactly.

110
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:11,160
She also has had a total world-destroying experience.

111
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:15,241
She lost her defining person.

112
00:08:15,241 --> 00:08:18,281
And the and that's crucial.

113
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,481
It's interesting that how many of you have have actually bought the Hiroshima monomore?

114
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:24,681
It was in the bookstore.

115
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:35,560
Well, then I have to definitely tell you that there is a completely wacky mistranslation on page 13, which is the introduction, the synopsis.

116
00:08:35,561 --> 00:08:40,441
But I don't know who who wrote it, but in French, it makes perfectly good sense.

117
00:08:40,441 --> 00:08:44,201
But in English, the synopsis begins, ends with the following.

118
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:52,201
It's trying to explain what Never, this town she's from and Hiroshima, mean to them.

119
00:08:52,201 --> 00:08:58,841
And it says, they are names of places, names that are not names, whatever that is, fancy talk.

120
00:08:58,841 --> 00:09:06,281
It is as though through them, all of Hiroshima was in love with all of Nevair.

121
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,921
I have no idea what that means.

122
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:12,280
And there's no hint of that in the French.

123
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,440
The French says something else, just what he said.

124
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:24,441
The French says, the disaster of the woman head shaved in Never and the disaster of Hiroshima correspond exactly.

125
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,520
Now, how you could call that a translation?

126
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,201
It's more like a hallucination.

127
00:09:29,241 --> 00:09:31,801
There's no correspondence between.

128
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,841
But anyway, but that's the right thing to say.

129
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,361
That's the whole point.

130
00:09:36,361 --> 00:09:54,560
The whole movie operates on the assumption that they correspond exactly, down to minute details, like the fact that when they were suffering disaster and world destruction, everybody in the world elsewhere was singing happily.

131
00:09:55,121 --> 00:10:11,361
In her case, it was the end of the war, the liberation of France by the Americans, and everybody else was singing the Marseillaise, and she was mourning her just recently killed lover.

132
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:27,681
And for him, when he experienced this, same kind of experience, then everybody was celebrating the end of the war with the Japanese, the surrender, because we dropped two bombs, but he was in misery.

133
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,481
So, I mean, every detail corresponds.

134
00:10:30,481 --> 00:10:35,440
And another way it corresponds, remember, it goes by so fast.

135
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,561
At one point, she says she was filled with bitterness.

136
00:10:38,561 --> 00:10:42,161
And he says, you said you spit in your mother's face.

137
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,121
And she says, yes, you would know, or something like that.

138
00:10:45,121 --> 00:10:52,000
They were both filled with bitterness because of the awfulness that happened, and that everybody else was happy.

139
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,081
Okay, now that's just the background.

140
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:59,281
Everything else is going to make sense on the basis once you sort that out.

141
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:04,961
So now comes the place where it begins to look like she must have read Kierkegaard.

142
00:11:04,961 --> 00:11:08,721
And I have heard that she did read Kierkegaard.

143
00:11:08,721 --> 00:11:11,281
I wish I could find, you know, somebody saying that.

144
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,961
It would just be nice to know.

145
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:29,361
In fact, I think I'd rather that she hadn't read Kierkegaard, because then it would show that this phenomenon, this complicated phenomenon of Knights of Faith and Knights of Resignation and all that, is something that you just can, anybody can get if they're just a deep person who's had enough experience.

146
00:11:29,361 --> 00:11:36,481
I don't know, but it looks like she's got the distinction between lower immediacy, mediation, and higher immediacy.

147
00:11:36,481 --> 00:11:37,961
So we start with that.

148
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,640
What happens?

149
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:46,201
First, we find out about nature early, right about in the beginning of the movie, on page 19.

150
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:56,681
Hiroshima was blanketed with flowers, corn flowers, gladiola, and they came forth from the ashes with extraordinary vigor, unheard of for flowers till then.

151
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,681
And the same thing with the fish in the river.

152
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:06,520
They came back with extraordinary amount of fish of all colors and shapes.

153
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,521
I forget where it is, but it does.

154
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,520
Well, let me just, if I find it, I'll tell you.

155
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,121
24, I think.

156
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,561
Yeah, yeah, 24.

157
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:23,081
The branches of the river also freshen and rich with fish, gray and blue, depending on the hour and so forth.

158
00:12:23,081 --> 00:12:24,280
In other words, what?

159
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,481
About nature.

160
00:12:25,481 --> 00:12:30,281
Does nature care about world destroying disasters?

161
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,160
Not a bit.

162
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,721
I'm a little puzzled why nature comes back even stronger than before.

163
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:40,520
I had an idea about it about three days ago, and I thought, aha, but then I forgot it.

164
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,880
So luckily, it's not central.

165
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,720
I hope I remember it again.

166
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:53,321
But I mean, it does not seem to me that when the caterpillar, maybe it's like the caterpillar becoming a butterfly, though that wasn't my thought last time.

167
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:59,081
I mean, nature can take a turn for the better by sudden changes.

168
00:12:59,081 --> 00:13:03,000
It doesn't make, I think it doesn't matter whether nature stays the same.

169
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,480
The main thing is that nature comes back.

170
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,920
It's the immediate.

171
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,241
And I say, look at Fear and Trembling, page 72.

172
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,920
I don't remember why, so let's look and see why.

173
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,640
Here, oh, yeah, I think I read this already, about two-thirds down.

174
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,040
Only lower natures forget themselves and become something new.

175
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:28,081
Thus, the butterfly has already forgotten that it was a caterpillar.

176
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,720
Perhaps it will so completely forget it that there was a butterfly that it will become a fish.

177
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:40,001
I wonder if that is any, if that's a sign that she's read it, because when she thinks about the lower nature, she writes about fish.

178
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:46,400
But in any case, so there's the bottom level, the immediate, nature, that vegetation.

179
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:54,720
And then, and the woman, too, is in nature and has a part of her anyway, her body.

180
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,480
It goes on in spite of the world-destroying disaster.

181
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,040
Remember some things, her hair grows back, one over here on 98.

182
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,760
She gets over her madness in the spring.

183
00:14:07,761 --> 00:14:15,601
On 37, she says, just in sort of passing, mumbling, that her madness went away little by little.

184
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:21,520
And then, of course, when I had children, all that is nature.

185
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:24,161
But she doesn't want to be part of nature.

186
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,761
She doesn't want to be a lower nature.

187
00:14:25,761 --> 00:14:27,841
She's resisting it.

188
00:14:27,841 --> 00:14:31,520
On page 23, we hear about the middle.

189
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:39,920
For my part, I struggle with all my might every day against the horror of no longer understanding at all the reason for remembering.

190
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:46,240
And so she's holding on to the memory of this world destroying disaster.

191
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,960
She's not going to just forget it and go off with somebody else.

192
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,200
Now, you wonder, but she's off with him, but I'll tell you more about that later.

193
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,280
And she has plenty of lovers, it turns out.

194
00:14:57,281 --> 00:14:58,560
But that's different.

195
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:01,841
That's not like the German.

196
00:15:01,841 --> 00:15:05,121
And she's not going to forget the German.

197
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:09,561
And she wants it to be a lasting thing in her life.

198
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,160
She wants it to be eternity.

199
00:15:12,521 --> 00:15:17,560
She talks about, she wants a memory of stone, it says on 23.

200
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,081
Where is that?

201
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,361
He says, no, you don't have a memory.

202
00:15:22,361 --> 00:15:23,801
Well, that's part of the.

203
00:15:24,601 --> 00:15:25,801
You don't know what it is.

204
00:15:26,281 --> 00:15:28,121
You don't know what it is to forget.

205
00:15:28,521 --> 00:15:30,121
She says, like you, I have a memory.

206
00:15:30,121 --> 00:15:31,321
I know what it is to forget.

207
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:32,601
No, you don't have a memory.

208
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:36,440
This is going to turn out to be very important later, but I can't tell you what it means yet.

209
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,160
But she says, like you, I tried with all my might not to forget.

210
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:47,081
I wanted to have an inconsolable memory, a memory of shadows and stone.

211
00:15:47,081 --> 00:15:54,440
And then you see the bicycle sort of photographed onto the stone by the bomb flash.

212
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,480
She wants, and it seems she wants eternity to get out of time.

213
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,921
That's really, I guess, what's going on in her madness.

214
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,321
Since it's madness, it's a little hard to tell.

215
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:08,121
And it isn't something we have to figure out.

216
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:15,960
But she's in the cellar, and she talks about on 59 that she wants eternity.

217
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,400
She says, in a trance-like state, it says.

218
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,920
And then on 62, more about that.

219
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,680
He says to her, and then one day, my love, you come out of eternity.

220
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,800
That is, you can't live.

221
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:44,440
Since she's a human being with a human body in the human temporal world, she can't really stay in this timeless mode, which is just sort of craziness, catatonic craziness.

222
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,680
So she comes out of it.

223
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:52,640
By the way, that same page says, and I didn't read it, but I'll read it now, this is the bitterness.

224
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,241
She says, oh, what pain.

225
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,361
It's unbelievable.

226
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:57,761
Everywhere in the city, they're singing the Marcia's.

227
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,160
But I'll go back to this.

228
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:09,920
So somehow she wants to be in eternity and not be gobbled up, so to speak, by nature and become lower immediacy.

229
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:14,640
And she figures out, in effect, without thinking about it.

230
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:24,240
Her sensibility teaches her a way to have eternity and time without being crazy.

231
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,321
And there has to be something about her which is not going to change like nature.

232
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,160
Now, what is that?

233
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,121
What does she discover?

234
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:45,601
What has she discovered when she can come out that allows her to come back into the world and in time still have this kind of timeless eternity?

235
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:56,081
What has she got that keeps her from being like nature and changing and outgrowing and forgetting?

236
00:17:57,361 --> 00:17:58,240
Yeah.

237
00:17:59,841 --> 00:18:07,680
That's right, but it's a certain way of having it because she is very worried that she'll forget the memory of the old hermit lover.

238
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,601
What has she done to keep that from happening?

239
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,960
Yeah.

240
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,841
Well, one of you, either of you, go ahead, or both of you.

241
00:18:17,841 --> 00:18:21,521
But she has the commitment already.

242
00:18:21,521 --> 00:18:24,241
I mean, that's, he's her defining commitment, that's sure.

243
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,920
She's totally in love with him, and she says right before he slaps her, he was my first love.

244
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,921
And but what, but what?

245
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,601
See what?

246
00:18:39,801 --> 00:18:41,561
Not having anybody, any other lover.

247
00:18:43,561 --> 00:18:45,880
I can't hear somebody tell me what you said.

248
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,361
Wait, I'll come over where I can hear both of you.

249
00:18:48,521 --> 00:18:49,000
That's all right.

250
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:50,841
I just can't hear you over there.

251
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,321
Ah, good.

252
00:18:53,321 --> 00:18:54,121
I got it.

253
00:18:54,121 --> 00:18:55,480
Yes, that's right.

254
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,321
But that's sort of it's true and it's important.

255
00:18:59,321 --> 00:19:02,760
She hasn't even told her husband, because you were sort of knowing.

256
00:19:02,761 --> 00:19:06,281
But that follows from this other deep thing she did.

257
00:19:06,281 --> 00:19:07,560
You want to say something?

258
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,121
She wants to say something.

259
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,121
Yes, that's very special.

260
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:15,880
That's so special.

261
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:27,240
But we'll get, and you know, and it had this huge dramatic effect on her and on him and the whole, on the whole plot when she finally told him the story when he got her drunk in the bar.

262
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:33,800
But but what movement has she made to talk like Kiribati?

263
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:44,520
Which means in some fancy talk, what way of behaving has she taken off, but she's got infinite resignation.

264
00:19:44,521 --> 00:20:01,081
She's turned her love into the eternal, invulnerable significance of the love, which she constantly remembers and idealizes and holds on to as the most important thing in her life.

265
00:20:01,081 --> 00:20:04,920
That's not even the right way to put it, the defining thing in her life.

266
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,040
That's what a knight of resignation does.

267
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:17,720
And that gives her just what Kierkegaard says knights of resignation have, some comfort in sorrow, as he puts it, I think, on 74.

268
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:22,400
That sums it up so well, and I certainly want to see it.

269
00:20:21,801 --> 00:20:23,601
So I'm looking for it.

270
00:20:30,321 --> 00:20:32,640
Well, it isn't there, so let me think about that.

271
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,240
Why isn't it there?

272
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,321
74.

273
00:20:36,321 --> 00:20:39,040
Do you see comfort and sorrow around in there?

274
00:20:39,361 --> 00:20:41,440
Hmm.

275
00:20:41,761 --> 00:20:44,800
There must be some reason I said I should look at this page.

276
00:20:44,801 --> 00:20:48,961
Ah, well, it's a variation on it, about eight lines from the bottom.

277
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,400
In infinite resignation, there is peace and repose and consolation in the pain.

278
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,601
I mean, obviously, there's two kinds of pain.

279
00:20:57,601 --> 00:21:02,081
I mean, remembering this terribly painful loss of pain.

280
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:09,121
But then, of course, she's remembering also the joy of riding her bicycle to meet him in the countryside and so forth.

281
00:21:09,761 --> 00:21:21,680
But the real sorrow is that you have to give up the finite and the temporal joy of living with somebody intimately day in and day out.

282
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,240
That's the sorrow.

283
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,041
We've talked about that already in Kierkegaard.

284
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:43,041
That is, if you want to make your love safe by making the movement of resignation and saying what really matters is that the meaning of this love is what defines me, you give up being able to live day by day happily with the loved one.

285
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,641
You don't even know what to do with him.

286
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,520
She doesn't have that problem.

287
00:21:46,081 --> 00:21:48,081
Dead, there's no problem whatever to do with him.

288
00:21:48,081 --> 00:21:50,160
But she has lost something.

289
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,040
The comfort in sorrow is what she's got.

290
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,400
And it's so wonderful in the movie.

291
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,761
They've done it so well.

292
00:21:57,761 --> 00:21:59,920
There are pictures in the scenario.

293
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,281
And you see her looking this mixture.

294
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,440
In one picture.

295
00:22:05,521 --> 00:22:09,801
I mean, you can see it on there are many pictures, but I'll try to tell you which one I really think is perfect.

296
00:22:10,361 --> 00:22:33,081
The ones around page 30 and 31, particularly at half of 31, where she's looking, that's the moment she sees first with a sort of happy look, the Japanese man lying on the bed, and then she sees his hand, and then she sees his hand moving, and he cuts to the German lover dying.

297
00:22:33,081 --> 00:22:42,601
And this mixture of sorrow and serenity, too, at the same time, is very peculiar.

298
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:48,601
And it's perfect for what he's trying to say, what it ought to be to be a night of resignation.

299
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:55,480
She should be serene and sad, and definitely, you know, frozen in time.

300
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,520
I wonder what that is.

301
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,841
I guess that's the thing.

302
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,880
Yeah, that's just those pages.

303
00:23:04,761 --> 00:23:14,361
So she's got infinite sadness because she's left the world, and lost temporal day by day with the other person that she loves.

304
00:23:16,601 --> 00:23:20,841
And it's infinite sadness because it isn't just that some events are sad.

305
00:23:20,841 --> 00:23:23,240
It isn't even that all events are sad.

306
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:30,200
Remember, whenever you see infinite in Kierkegaard, it means that the world is such that any new event that came along would be sad.

307
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:36,041
It's not just the total of anything of what's happened already, because it's a world-defining sadness.

308
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,601
She lives in a world that is sad.

309
00:23:38,601 --> 00:23:41,241
Anything that comes along is going to be sad.

310
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,760
That means she's infinitely sad in Kierkegaard.

311
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,601
All possible events and situations are sad.

312
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:56,000
And what she wanted, she says, is when she lost her lover, is to be dead too.

313
00:23:56,321 --> 00:24:01,121
And in a certain way, she is, because he's outside.

314
00:24:01,121 --> 00:24:13,040
I mean, if living is living sort of alive with somebody intimately, body to body and going through the world together, she's lost that on purpose.

315
00:24:13,361 --> 00:24:21,361
And she says on 65, all I could find between his body and mine were obvious similarities.

316
00:24:21,361 --> 00:24:22,640
Do you understand?

317
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,760
And then she shouts, he was my first love.

318
00:24:25,761 --> 00:24:34,241
And at that point, she's gotten so deep into her resignation and her self-pity and her hanging on to this defining experience.

319
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,081
That's when he slaps her to try to knock her out of it.

320
00:24:38,081 --> 00:24:40,400
And he does knock her out of it, sort of.

321
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,240
She comes to, and then she starts telling the story again.

322
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,040
One day I screamed and they put me in the cellar and so forth and so forth.

323
00:24:49,361 --> 00:24:52,241
And we got to go more into that now.

324
00:24:53,121 --> 00:24:56,321
So she's given up the finite and the temporal.

325
00:24:56,321 --> 00:24:58,800
I have pages to tell you that, too.

326
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,680
78.

327
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:07,920
He says, huh.

328
00:25:10,081 --> 00:25:11,121
I didn't think about this.

329
00:25:11,121 --> 00:25:11,520
Let's see.

330
00:25:11,521 --> 00:25:13,200
They talk about they have three days.

331
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,520
She, time enough for what?

332
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,560
To live from it, to die from it.

333
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:21,040
Time enough to know which, he says.

334
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:22,400
That doesn't exist.

335
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,400
Neither time enough to live from it nor time enough to die from it.

336
00:25:26,561 --> 00:25:28,240
So I don't give a damn.

337
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:37,001
I take it that means, and he, I would have preferred that you would have died in Never, and she says, so would I, but I didn't die in Never.

338
00:25:37,001 --> 00:25:39,960
I mean, so this is that's just perfect to explain.

339
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,841
She doesn't care about anything that happens in time.

340
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,760
She wishes she were dead.

341
00:25:44,761 --> 00:26:02,841
She does the best she can to be dead in a way that it doesn't mean that she doesn't make movies and enjoy spending the night with the Japanese man, and she's very happy the next morning and out on the veranda drinking coffee and looking serene.

342
00:26:02,841 --> 00:26:07,400
But it means that nothing important can happen in time.

343
00:26:08,121 --> 00:26:12,361
Everything important has been eternalized, namely her relation to the German.

344
00:26:12,521 --> 00:26:14,601
That's all that's important.

345
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,321
That's the meaning of her life.

346
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:25,161
And that gives her a certain interesting ease and detachment, which you don't have in the movie in words.

347
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,960
You see it.

348
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:33,160
But Marguerite Dera describes it, and it's really interesting on page 11, although 10.

349
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,000
And this is nice.

350
00:26:35,001 --> 00:26:38,040
What happened in Never, her native city?

351
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:40,440
What happened to make her the way she is?

352
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,920
So free and yet so haunted.

353
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,680
See, there are going to be a whole lot of things now.

354
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,200
Why is she free?

355
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,760
Well, because nothing can hurt her.

356
00:26:48,761 --> 00:26:49,960
Nothing matters.

357
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,801
Remember, ethics doesn't matter, and what people think about her doesn't matter.

358
00:26:54,121 --> 00:26:55,321
Nothing matters.

359
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,361
But yet she's haunted, of course, by this secret.

360
00:26:58,361 --> 00:27:00,601
So honest and yet so dishonest.

361
00:27:00,601 --> 00:27:01,880
That's an interesting one.

362
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:15,720
Before she even tells him the story, she's very frank with him, expressing exactly what she feels and how her views about things and her enjoyment of the sex they have together and all that.

363
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:19,880
She's completely honest and yet so dishonest.

364
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,760
Why?

365
00:27:21,081 --> 00:27:21,480
How?

366
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,121
That should be, you should know.

367
00:27:24,321 --> 00:27:26,801
Why is she completely dishonest?

368
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:32,960
Does she tell anybody who she really is and what she really cares about?

369
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,400
Nobody, not even her husband, knows.

370
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,200
Oh, and so the Japanese man, a special thing.

371
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,040
How come he knows?

372
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:49,040
The moment she mentions Never, he sits up in bed and turns on the light.

373
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:57,760
He knows that something happened in Never that makes her special and makes him so attracted to her.

374
00:27:57,761 --> 00:27:58,880
And what happened?

375
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,280
Well, her German lover died.

376
00:28:01,281 --> 00:28:04,801
But she didn't tell him that to tell the Japanese man.

377
00:28:04,801 --> 00:28:06,480
She didn't tell anybody.

378
00:28:07,281 --> 00:28:09,361
And she is so equivocal and so clear.

379
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:11,760
She seems so open and clear.

380
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:15,760
And yet, of course, again, it's always the deepest thing about her you don't know.

381
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:23,121
And then, so cowardly, so predisposed to chance love affairs, and that is open.

382
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,000
And so cowardly when faced with love.

383
00:28:26,001 --> 00:28:27,841
That means commitment.

384
00:28:27,841 --> 00:28:29,680
That's what he wants.

385
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:42,560
And the thing to see there is that what she wants is really a commitment to somebody finite and temporal, like the German.

386
00:28:42,561 --> 00:28:48,240
But she can't have it because she's got her infinite resignation toward the German.

387
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,880
So she's open to all these love affairs and even looking for intimacy.

388
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:04,001
And yet she's totally afraid of a commitment because, because as it gets clearer and clearer in the movie, why is she so afraid of the commitment?

389
00:29:04,081 --> 00:29:06,000
What would it do to her?

390
00:29:06,001 --> 00:29:06,841
Can you see that?

391
00:29:06,321 --> 00:29:07,640
You see that coming?

392
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,880
That's right, the German lover.

393
00:29:14,601 --> 00:29:18,601
If she loves the Japanese man, she's going to forget the German lover.

394
00:29:18,601 --> 00:29:21,640
And that's the thing she is totally afraid of.

395
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:28,681
Because what would that do to her in levels of kinds of being?

396
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:33,800
What kind of creature would she be then, from her point of view?

397
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,200
Lower immediacy.

398
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,000
Yeah, that's right.

399
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:39,160
She'd go back to being like the caterpillar.

400
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:44,200
And what she wants more than anything else is to have a meaning, a fixed meaning in her life.

401
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:47,480
We'll come back to that because that's absolutely crucial.

402
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:50,121
But it starts being crucial at this point.

403
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:50,921
Let's see.

404
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:54,601
So she, let's see, I'm going to do fear and trembling on 67.

405
00:29:54,601 --> 00:29:57,481
I tell her, probably it's the same point.

406
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:07,640
Well, and again, you really wonder when she gives that description of the lady.

407
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:13,480
And Kierkegaard says, Knights of infinite regulation are readily recognized.

408
00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:15,881
Their gait is gliding and bold.

409
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:17,400
That's another thing about her.

410
00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:24,360
She is so sort of serene, nothing can hurt her, and bold, because, again, nothing can hurt her.

411
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:29,160
It's another, it's a kind, it could have been in that list from Marguerite Giervas.

412
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,081
It's the same idea.

413
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:32,200
Now, where are we?

414
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,321
Uh-huh.

415
00:30:33,561 --> 00:30:35,480
And it all comes from being invulnerable.

416
00:30:35,481 --> 00:30:47,160
She's lost everything, and in a certain sense, she has nothing to lose, and she's got everything by making the love eternal and defining.

417
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,801
And so she's already got everything won, but she's certainly invulnerable.

418
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,401
And what does she lose?

419
00:30:56,401 --> 00:31:08,640
Well, when I've said it, she can have these sexual encounters, but what she can't have is intimacy because she can't talk about what's really important to her, the only thing that's really important.

420
00:31:09,921 --> 00:31:11,440
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

421
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,121
She had no husband, the Japanese, the French woman.

422
00:31:25,121 --> 00:31:27,121
No, I don't know what makes you think so.

423
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,640
Oh, she has a husband.

424
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,760
Oh, I see what you mean.

425
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,361
Yes, she has a husband.

426
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,400
I better turn this on.

427
00:31:32,401 --> 00:31:33,121
I forgot.

428
00:31:33,121 --> 00:31:37,760
I hope that I, the pod people are taping this anyway.

429
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:45,121
But anyway, so she, yes, she has a husband.

430
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:54,000
She has a husband and a child, but she's got no intimacy with her husband.

431
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:58,721
If intimacy means that you tell people what's important to you and who you really are.

432
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,160
And he's got a wife.

433
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:04,001
And remember, they're both happily married people.

434
00:32:04,001 --> 00:32:14,881
And meaning that they've got a kind of satisfactory relation, but it's outside of what's really important to each of them.

435
00:32:14,881 --> 00:32:20,240
Now, him, we don't get to till the end of today, because he's no knight of resignation.

436
00:32:20,561 --> 00:32:22,881
But then he's complicated and interesting, too.

437
00:32:22,881 --> 00:32:24,721
Let's stick with her for a while.

438
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:26,241
Where are we?

439
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,321
Okay.

440
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:33,361
So she yearns for real intimacy.

441
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,560
That's when she talks about how it's great to be with a human being, right now.

442
00:32:38,121 --> 00:32:40,041
It never works out, apparently.

443
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:41,721
She says, where does she say that?

444
00:32:43,481 --> 00:32:44,760
Too many different books.

445
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,441
Two is too many.

446
00:32:47,401 --> 00:32:54,601
So he says on 68, oh, how good it is to be with someone sometime.

447
00:32:54,601 --> 00:33:07,401
But that's, I mean, it's that sort of interesting thing for her to say because that's true in any case when she's with one of her lovers, whenever she picks one up, whatever she's making her movies.

448
00:33:07,401 --> 00:33:31,160
But it's also something she's saying because with him, it's much, much more really with someone once they have each understood that they share this big secret that their world was destroyed and that they're living out of it after it and somehow in terms of it.

449
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,440
And so that's what she really wants.

450
00:33:34,441 --> 00:33:37,240
She yearns for that kind of intimacy.

451
00:33:37,881 --> 00:33:41,000
And he can have it, it looks like.

452
00:33:41,001 --> 00:33:45,400
And she sort of half understands and doesn't.

453
00:33:45,401 --> 00:33:47,401
I'll talk more about that later, too.

454
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:57,720
I think she really never understands what he's up to because she knows that he's got something she hasn't got.

455
00:33:58,041 --> 00:34:03,320
He's happy and not, he's totally different from her.

456
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:08,121
He's completely happily involved in the current scene in Hiroshima.

457
00:34:08,121 --> 00:34:10,040
He's a politician, it turns out.

458
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:12,920
He's an architect, and so forth.

459
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:18,361
And he's certainly able to sort of throw himself completely into his pursuit of her.

460
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,521
All of that, she hasn't got at all.

461
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:26,001
And she talks about this on 77 of the movie.

462
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:34,321
She's saying these strange things: take me, deform me to your likeness.

463
00:34:34,961 --> 00:34:40,721
And that means somehow make me like you.

464
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:50,560
But you've got to see, I mean, these people don't know, you know, these Kierkegaardian terms, but what's happening is, I draw it like this.

465
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:53,281
So here's the night of resignation.

466
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,041
Here's the night of faith.

467
00:34:55,041 --> 00:35:01,041
I'm happy to talk about this because people came into the office hours, those people who could find me.

468
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:05,280
And here's the defining commitment.

469
00:35:05,441 --> 00:35:06,481
This is the chart you've got.

470
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:07,520
I'm not adding anything.

471
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,640
There's the defining commitment.

472
00:35:10,961 --> 00:35:15,601
And then there, wait a minute, is that right?

473
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:16,320
Yeah.

474
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:22,561
And then mediation so that it isn't fanatic and it isn't dependent.

475
00:35:22,881 --> 00:35:30,640
And then this sort of branch point, which is the movement of resignation.

476
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:38,640
This was very hard to understand, and Kierkegaard doesn't understand it very well himself and messes it up, so no wonder you can't understand it.

477
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,760
And it took me years, and I'm not even sure this is right.

478
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,601
And if you think it isn't, write me a paper and I'll change my lecture.

479
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:55,361
But it seems that the movement of resignation is the moment when you realize, Kierkegaard says, that you can be sufficient unto yourself.

480
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,800
You understand your eternal validity.

481
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:00,880
I don't have any idea why he says that.

482
00:36:00,881 --> 00:36:04,320
I mean, it just muddies things to say eternal validity there.

483
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:08,440
Some jargon that he's got from somewhere, maybe Hegel or something.

484
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:26,680
The phenomena is that if you're not going to be fanatical, if you're not going to think that if the other person dies, you have to die, then, and like Lear with Cordelia, as I said, and so forth, then you have to understand that you could be self-sufficient.

485
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:34,281
He has to have this, otherwise he gets this business of total dependency on the other person, where you think that you couldn't exist if they went away.

486
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,961
And that's not the way to think about it.

487
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:37,321
She exists, okay.

488
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:44,680
I mean, she has lost the ultimate crucial meaning in her life, and she would have rather died, but she's getting along.

489
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:55,961
I mean, because she's made not only the movement of resignation, so far the movement of resignation is that she could get along without her German lover.

490
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,041
But she's made a movement further.

491
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:02,280
She became a knight of resignation.

492
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,721
The tricky thing is, in Kierkegaard, that everybody's got to make the movement of resignation.

493
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:12,201
But to make a knight of resignation means you install yourself in it.

494
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,481
You say, that's the end of the line.

495
00:37:15,481 --> 00:37:17,160
That's what I'm going to be.

496
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:23,640
I'm going to just build my life around the person who loved and lost the German soldier.

497
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,001
That's more than just saying I'm self-efficient.

498
00:37:27,001 --> 00:37:32,441
That says I've got a defining commitment, and I'm going to sort of take it up into myself.

499
00:37:32,441 --> 00:37:40,521
And it does make me self-sufficient, that it makes me self-sufficient in a way, and this is the crucial thing, that I can't get from there to here.

500
00:37:40,521 --> 00:37:46,200
Because if you're a knight of resignation, then you can't get to be a knight of faith.

501
00:37:46,441 --> 00:37:55,280
And a knight of faith, we're going to come back to that today, is able to be happy in the finite and get the finite and temporal back.

502
00:37:55,921 --> 00:38:03,921
To see the Kierkegaard thing, the sword over the head of the beloved, and yet find joy in the finite as if it was the surest thing of all.

503
00:38:03,921 --> 00:38:05,361
She can't do that.

504
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:10,801
That's why she's stuck up here with comfort in sorrow.

505
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:19,121
And now, and I remember why I'm saying this, to tell you something important.

506
00:38:19,441 --> 00:38:20,800
Oh, yeah, why is she?

507
00:38:21,121 --> 00:38:22,800
She has to be destroyed.

508
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,481
This strange line, destroy me and make me in your likeness.

509
00:38:26,481 --> 00:38:46,961
I take that to mean, and he takes it to mean, and that's what he tries to do when he gets her drunk, is you've got to sort of destroy the old personality, the narrative, the kind of person she's become as this gliding, secure, resigned, sad person, and bring her back to here.

510
00:38:46,961 --> 00:38:49,441
And then she could come up here and be like him.

511
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:55,281
And that's what she sort of dimly realizes when she says, destroy me to your likeness.

512
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,561
And that's, and destroy me, you're so good for me, and so forth.

513
00:39:00,561 --> 00:39:02,720
But, and he tries.

514
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,361
He tries brilliantly to destroy her whole narrative.

515
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:13,521
And the interesting thing is, he does, in a certain way, almost destroy her whole story with the German.

516
00:39:13,521 --> 00:39:16,640
But it doesn't work out the way he expected.

517
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,881
I have to go into that in detail, but not quite yet.

518
00:39:20,881 --> 00:39:34,640
So, but she wants to be like him, and that means, I think, capable of real intimacy, which he certainly is with her, but she can't reciprocate with him.

519
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,561
One, she's afraid of it, but she's not even afraid of it.

520
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:48,121
As long as she's up here, it would be disaster for her and her understanding of the meaning of her life.

521
00:39:48,121 --> 00:39:54,201
Again, for reasons that are hard to see, but I mean, not obscure, but subtle, which I will get to.

522
00:39:54,200 --> 00:40:09,561
But the confusion that Kierkegaard has, I don't want to go into it, is he sometimes says you make this movement and then this movement, and then sometimes he says you make the movement of resignation simultaneously with either this or this.

523
00:40:09,561 --> 00:40:11,481
And that's the right thing to say.

524
00:40:11,481 --> 00:40:19,400
Because if you really had to make the movement, if this, not anyone who explained, it's too crazy.

525
00:40:19,881 --> 00:40:20,360
Okay.

526
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:30,280
I mean, if you make the movement so that you go through being a knight of resignation on the way to being a knight of faith, then this diagram doesn't make any sense.

527
00:40:30,521 --> 00:40:32,680
There isn't any way to get from here to here.

528
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:42,201
So it must be that you make the movement of resignation and you go on making it in a way that gets you up here, or you make it and you go on making it in a way that gets you up there.

529
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:47,160
And whichever one it is, it's something you hold on to simultaneously.

530
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,200
And that's okay.

531
00:40:49,961 --> 00:40:52,200
It's not something to worry about.

532
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,001
He should have just said that you do it.

533
00:40:55,481 --> 00:41:04,440
He says the night of resignation makes the movement of resignation and then more, and one more movement, and it's marvelous they become a knight of faith.

534
00:41:04,441 --> 00:41:05,561
That's wrong.

535
00:41:05,561 --> 00:41:14,360
And he says that in the other place he says, you are they are he's always, even the night of faith is simultaneously making the movement of resignation.

536
00:41:14,441 --> 00:41:15,640
That's what.

537
00:41:15,961 --> 00:41:18,280
But as I say, I stop worrying about that.

538
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,881
I haven't even got the page references because I don't, I'm not interested in what he messes up.

539
00:41:23,521 --> 00:41:25,281
Now, let's see.

540
00:41:21,961 --> 00:41:27,680
So she, yeah.

541
00:41:44,881 --> 00:41:46,560
Yeah, I don't know.

542
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:52,401
Can you any of you got that enough to be able to answer her?

543
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:57,601
Not being conventional?

544
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,481
There's an area.

545
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:07,841
I see what you're imagining, but I don't see why yet.

546
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:13,521
I mean, I see that you're seeing these two circles, and what is this thing of overlapping?

547
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,401
I see the movement of resignation is shared between the two.

548
00:42:26,401 --> 00:42:37,121
Well, that's okay, except that doesn't capture the fact that this one is a dead end and you can't get from this one to this one, which is what I'm trying to capture.

549
00:42:38,001 --> 00:42:42,880
It does capture the fact that they have something in common if this is the night of resignation.

550
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:44,480
I think that's what you're thinking, right?

551
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:47,520
And this is the night of faith, and they have this much in common.

552
00:42:47,521 --> 00:42:49,841
They both made the movement of resignation.

553
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,561
Right.

554
00:42:50,561 --> 00:43:00,721
But there's something very special about being a knight of resignation, and that is to get sort of hooked in this one in a way that you can't get to this one.

555
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,761
And I try to get that with this picture, and I don't think the Venn diagram gets it better than I got it.

556
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:08,121
I think I got it better.

557
00:43:06,401 --> 00:43:08,360
Yeah.

558
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,800
No, no, well, that's no, no, you shouldn't.

559
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,721
That's the wrong way to think about it.

560
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:23,961
Abraham, or good, if you think about it, maybe you're saying the right thing.

561
00:43:23,961 --> 00:43:25,881
Abraham makes the double movement.

562
00:43:25,881 --> 00:43:29,081
That is, he's up here and he goes there through here.

563
00:43:29,081 --> 00:43:33,721
But he doesn't make, he does not become the night of resignation.

564
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:37,241
The night of faith just isn't the night of resignation.

565
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,601
And if you are a knight of resignation, you can't be a knight of faith.

566
00:43:40,601 --> 00:43:45,321
And the way to put it is, do you get the finite and temporal or don't you?

567
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:59,881
And if you're over here, you are absolutely outside of being able to live with the actual intimate bodily other person because you turned the meaning, all you care about is the meaning of the relationship, which is safe.

568
00:43:59,881 --> 00:44:02,280
And nobody can be in both of these.

569
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:28,841
Either you want to make the meaning safe and you give up time, day-by-day life with the other person, or you get a funny kind of funny, I mean, a mysterious, which I'll explain by the end of the hour, I hope, kind of relation which you can live with the other person in finite time and in the everyday, but with the security that you would have over here.

570
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:39,001
I see why you think you've got both, because he lives as if it's the surest thing of all, and he lives, or she in this case, as if it's the surest thing of all.

571
00:44:39,001 --> 00:44:41,241
But they do it absolutely differently.

572
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:46,200
She does it by getting rid of time and thereby making it safe.

573
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,001
Nothing can come along that can hurt her.

574
00:44:49,001 --> 00:44:53,761
And he does it by faith, which we haven't understood yet.

575
00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:00,321
I have let the cat out of the bag in the sense that maybe you already realized the Japanese man is a knight of faith.

576
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:08,320
It's a lot harder to show a knight of faith than a knight of resignation, and therefore he looks just like anybody else.

577
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:17,841
But remember, when you read the part about the guy who's going home to have the porridge with them, he's a knight of faith, but he looks just like he could have been a bank teller, I think it is.

578
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:27,440
So, and this guy, but anyway, I can't get ahead of the story, sorry, or I will not get it, you will get messed up.

579
00:45:27,441 --> 00:45:29,601
So, let's go back to where I was.

580
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:40,640
Okay, the next stage is the Japanese man comes on the scene, but now we're not going to understand him yet, but we're going to have him understanding her.

581
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:50,320
And they're going to go to this nightclub, and he's going to try to break her down so that she can become start a different kind of life.

582
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:54,961
He's going to try to destroy her resignation.

583
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:59,601
Interesting, a student pointed out to me: this is the kind of thing you will all help me.

584
00:46:00,001 --> 00:46:02,241
Never end to the interesting details.

585
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,640
You remember the name of the nightclub?

586
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,280
Was it not a nightclub?

587
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:07,920
A tea room then.

588
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,521
What's its name?

589
00:46:09,521 --> 00:46:10,880
Casablanca.

590
00:46:10,881 --> 00:46:13,121
And why, Casablanca?

591
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,880
How many have seen the movie?

592
00:46:14,881 --> 00:46:16,241
All of you, I imagine.

593
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,640
Those are two nights of resignation.

594
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:26,721
They have absolutely decided that each of them will remember forever, the love that might have been, but didn't work out.

595
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:33,441
And so it's perfect that they should be doing this thing there where he's going to try to now fix her.

596
00:46:33,441 --> 00:46:37,121
But right now, the problem is how to fix a night of resignation.

597
00:46:38,521 --> 00:46:46,441
And the answer is: well, get her to tell her story and turn it into a story instead of a secret.

598
00:46:47,081 --> 00:46:52,521
And he understands that he's got to get her to talk about what happened in Never.

599
00:46:52,521 --> 00:46:55,321
And this, I mentioned it, but I'll show you the page.

600
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:01,480
He says at the bottom 51, he says, tell me about Never.

601
00:47:01,481 --> 00:47:09,321
And he says, it was there I seem to have understood that you must have begun to be what you are today, which is, of course, right.

602
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:12,921
Everything he understands is always exactly right.

603
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,401
And how does Never look in the movie?

604
00:47:18,041 --> 00:47:25,321
When you see the town, how does it compare to seeing Hiroshima, these two towns, which are going to become the names of the people in there?

605
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,480
And so you need to look at the towns.

606
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,361
What's it like?

607
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,721
Does it look just like a normal town?

608
00:47:34,041 --> 00:47:41,001
Well, no, I think he filmed it always in twilight, never any lights on yet, but pretty dim.

609
00:47:41,001 --> 00:47:43,801
No cars, no people around.

610
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,680
It's dead.

611
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,760
It's really completely dead.

612
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:50,201
I mean, and how is Hiroshima?

613
00:47:51,481 --> 00:47:59,081
The lights are on all night, the neon signs are flashing, it's full of people running around, and so forth.

614
00:47:59,081 --> 00:48:08,440
I mean, it's sort of as if you could, if you, it wouldn't work, but I like to think of it as if Never is filmed in black and white, and Hiroshima wants to be in color.

615
00:48:08,441 --> 00:48:13,401
I mean, you want to see all those lights flashing, and it's just as full of light as you can get.

616
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:19,001
At the limit, you want to use computers and film her in black and white, him in color.

617
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,920
You're lucky I'm not making this movie.

618
00:48:20,921 --> 00:48:23,200
I would certainly destroy it.

619
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:28,480
But that's supposed to be, I think, the feeling you get.

620
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,240
And now he gets her to tell the story.

621
00:48:34,401 --> 00:48:38,241
I just tell you this to keep the plot straight because it is so confusing.

622
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:43,200
He gets her to identify him with the German soldier.

623
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:51,921
I mean, he understands that that's what's going on, and that she's stuck on the German soldier, so he starts her saying you and so forth.

624
00:48:51,921 --> 00:48:58,081
And for a while, she's talking to the Japanese man and saying you, but she's really talking to the German.

625
00:48:58,081 --> 00:49:01,680
And that's the first time through the movie, sort of confusing.

626
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,601
I see if I can turn to it.

627
00:49:04,001 --> 00:49:05,521
Where are we?

628
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,041
Not sure I can.

629
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:17,121
We're at the Casablanca, obviously, but when is that?

630
00:49:20,961 --> 00:49:22,080
Ah, here we are.

631
00:49:22,081 --> 00:49:24,320
There's a picture of him flapping her in the hand.

632
00:49:24,481 --> 00:49:25,601
So, okay.

633
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:26,960
They're there.

634
00:49:26,961 --> 00:49:34,960
So she's starting to say, she's talking about eternity and how she was young once.

635
00:49:34,961 --> 00:49:40,321
And she talks about what pain in my heart and so forth.

636
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:44,881
And all of this, she's talking to him in terms of you.

637
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,241
And she's talking about the German.

638
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:52,480
I'm beginning to forget you.

639
00:49:52,481 --> 00:49:55,361
I tremble, and I haven't forgotten so much love.

640
00:49:55,360 --> 00:50:01,440
And then she switches over and talking about what happened again.

641
00:50:01,441 --> 00:50:03,601
And we were supposed to meet at noon on the Kay.

642
00:50:03,601 --> 00:50:04,800
This is 64.

643
00:50:05,121 --> 00:50:09,640
I stayed near his body all day, and she switches back to talking about the German.

644
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:14,520
Then she switches again into this terrible sorrow for herself.

645
00:50:14,521 --> 00:50:17,561
He was my first love, and so forth.

646
00:50:17,561 --> 00:50:20,680
But the main thing is, and I'll try to explain this now.

647
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:29,321
He's trying to get her to tell the story, and thereby it won't be this super secret that defines her anymore.

648
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,521
How does that work?

649
00:50:30,521 --> 00:50:32,921
Well, let me get to where I am.

650
00:50:33,401 --> 00:50:43,561
See, he's got this nice idealized memories of the countryside and how, and they're making love in the little house that they found and so forth.

651
00:50:43,561 --> 00:51:01,081
And so it looks like maybe she wants, here's the slogan, you might say, is he sees in a therapy kind of way that if he's going to get her out of this, he's got to get this story out of her.

652
00:51:01,081 --> 00:51:04,920
And he's got to get it out of her into the public domain, so to speak.

653
00:51:04,921 --> 00:51:06,601
So it is a story.

654
00:51:06,601 --> 00:51:10,521
And then he can get her out of being all trapped in it.

655
00:51:10,521 --> 00:51:13,960
And he does get her to tell it as if it was a story.

656
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:17,160
And that completely backfires.

657
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:23,081
Because once she's told her story, she feels that she's been unfaithful to the German.

658
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:28,601
So she says, very important at the bottom of 73, you were not yet quite dead.

659
00:51:28,601 --> 00:51:29,800
I told our story.

660
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,600
I was unfaithful to you tonight with the stranger.

661
00:51:32,601 --> 00:51:33,881
I told our story.

662
00:51:33,881 --> 00:51:37,400
You see, it was, you see, a story that could be told.

663
00:51:37,401 --> 00:51:41,801
For 14 years, I hadn't found the taste of impossible love again.

664
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,280
Since Nevair, look how I'm forgetting you.

665
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,041
Look how I've forgotten you.

666
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:47,160
And so forth.

667
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,760
And that's why.

668
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,440
And how has it backfired?

669
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:55,680
Well, because it worked just the way he wanted it to work, but that didn't work.

670
00:51:55,921 --> 00:52:13,360
That is, he got her to see that this wasn't some marvelous, totally individuating disaster, but that it was a story that could be told, and thereby it becomes a three-penny novel, the one translation says.

671
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,760
I don't think the one that's what, what does this translation say?

672
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,761
Does it say a three-penny novel?

673
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,920
Yeah, something like that.

674
00:52:19,921 --> 00:52:21,041
It's slightly different.

675
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:26,160
But anyway, it becomes a trivial story, a story that could happen to anybody.

676
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,441
It's not her defining thing anymore.

677
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:36,561
She gave it her unique identity, was having this terrible secret.

678
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:41,521
And now, comes the twist where it backfires.

679
00:52:41,521 --> 00:52:56,961
How is she able to preserve the tremendous significance of this story, which if it were just a story, would be, you know, anybody could tell it and you could read it and it wouldn't be what made her whole life meaningful and so forth.

680
00:52:56,961 --> 00:53:04,401
There's one way she can keep the meaning of the story and keep it from being a mere story.

681
00:53:04,401 --> 00:53:12,881
And that is, and it's hard to see, but it's, in the end, I can say it in my language, she has to sacrifice her life for it.

682
00:53:12,881 --> 00:53:21,680
The only way that she can show that it's really important is that she will give up everything else that could be important to her for it.

683
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,680
And then it's no mere story.

684
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:29,041
Then it's something super that gives her life unconditional meaning.

685
00:53:29,601 --> 00:53:33,440
And that's how his move fails.

686
00:53:33,441 --> 00:53:43,080
By threatening her, in a way, with losing it, he forces her to sacrifice him because she can't have them both.

687
00:53:43,401 --> 00:53:48,761
And she won't give up the German and turn that into a story because then she'd just be a lower nature.

688
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,921
And she's only got two alternatives.

689
00:53:50,921 --> 00:53:59,481
She's either got to be a lower nature or she's got to save the eternal significance of the German lover.

690
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:09,961
And when he sort of confronts her with that, she chooses to save, she has to be Knight of Resignation, she chooses to save the significance of the German lover.

691
00:54:09,961 --> 00:54:17,001
And that means to sacrifice her possible intimacy and her possible happiness with the Japanese man, and he loses her.

692
00:54:17,001 --> 00:54:18,360
But we've got to go into more detail.

693
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,961
But anyway, go ahead.

694
00:54:20,601 --> 00:54:26,921
So, by him, maybe putting those story.

695
00:54:26,921 --> 00:54:32,760
But he did have that made to well, no.

696
00:54:33,401 --> 00:54:35,240
No, that's what he hoped.

697
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:44,921
If he could have broken her down, broken down her story, sort of knocked it out of her, literally, then she could have done this.

698
00:54:44,921 --> 00:55:01,801
But what happened was instead she retreated back up here when she saw the danger and saw that the only way to preserve this, this relation with the German, and not let it be just a general story that anybody could read or anybody could do is to be ready to die for it.

699
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,601
And that means to become a martyr for it.

700
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:07,801
That means to make somehow the ultimate sacrifice for it.

701
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:16,521
And the ultimate sacrifice is to give up the finite and the temporal, to give up the Japanese man, to give up the possibility of intimacy.

702
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:19,481
And that's what she's discovers she has to do.

703
00:55:19,481 --> 00:55:23,040
Otherwise, she's going to be just trivialized.

704
00:55:23,041 --> 00:55:24,561
That's how she sees it.

705
00:55:24,561 --> 00:55:26,240
And so now we follow that.

706
00:55:22,041 --> 00:55:26,960
Let's follow that.

707
00:55:27,121 --> 00:55:31,201
Because we quickly, of course, she sees that she's trapped in a kind of despair.

708
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,840
She can't, there's no way.

709
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:48,640
She's only got two choices: lower nature and a meaningless life, or a meaningful life as a night of resignation, holding on to this love as the highest thing in her life for which she'll sacrifice everything else.

710
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,321
And she chooses that.

711
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,520
But that's painful.

712
00:55:52,561 --> 00:56:00,961
That's desperation because that means she gives up forever the possibility of an intimate love again, like the German.

713
00:56:00,961 --> 00:56:03,760
And okay, now let's me, that's my way of talking about it.

714
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,360
Let me read it to you.

715
00:56:07,441 --> 00:56:12,481
On page 83, she sort of states her despair.

716
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:24,721
Well, when she sees all that I've been telling you, she immediately works, she sees that if she goes on, it'll become a three-penny story.

717
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:37,680
And she sees that she would become, and this is the middle of 80, silly little girl who dies of love at Nevere, little girl with shaven head, I bequeath you to oblivion, three-penny story, and so forth.

718
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,520
It was just the same then as it was with him.

719
00:56:43,521 --> 00:56:45,121
It will encompass your voice.

720
00:56:45,121 --> 00:56:46,321
This is very important.

721
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:59,121
She sees that if she forgets the German and goes with the Japanese man fully, then she's become lower nature because she'll equally well forget the Japanese man, maybe.

722
00:56:59,121 --> 00:57:07,121
I mean, if she betrays the German, then there's no reason to think, given the kind of person she is, that she won't betray the Japanese man.

723
00:57:07,561 --> 00:57:10,521
The same will happen to you as happened to him.

724
00:57:10,521 --> 00:57:13,401
Little by little, you will become a song.

725
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:20,201
So now she sees that she can't give up the German and have the Japanese man.

726
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:34,441
There's no way for her to give up the German without admitting that she can just drop what looked like a defining commitment, and then she's just back in lower nature.

727
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:38,760
And so she says on 83, I'll forget you.

728
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,361
I'm forgetting you already.

729
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,960
Look how I'm forgetting you.

730
00:57:41,961 --> 00:57:42,921
Look at me.

731
00:57:42,921 --> 00:57:47,561
And she gives, quote, a moan of utter sadness, the direction says.

732
00:57:47,561 --> 00:57:49,081
That's despair.

733
00:57:49,081 --> 00:57:51,561
That's just not any old moan of utter sadness.

734
00:57:52,280 --> 00:58:04,201
That's the realization that to have meaning in her life, she's got to give up the joy of the finite and the temporal and keep the comfort in sorrow.

735
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:07,160
And she sees it, and she does it.

736
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,401
She's not going to go with him.

737
00:58:09,401 --> 00:58:11,081
Okay, now let's see.

738
00:58:11,401 --> 00:58:15,640
He sees that a life of infinite resignation, I wrote here, isn't working.

739
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:16,601
It hasn't worked.

740
00:58:16,601 --> 00:58:17,961
It never will work.

741
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:23,640
But working means to be joyful and secure, like the Knight of Faith is.

742
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,001
We'll get to that now.

743
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:33,721
But we see that she has to choose between this kind of non-temporal eternity and happiness in time.

744
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,801
And she sees it and she chooses it.

745
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:39,721
She goes and gives him up.

746
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,800
Now, let me see.

747
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,721
I want to make sure that I get to this.

748
00:58:44,121 --> 00:58:45,480
The Japanese man.

749
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:49,800
So, okay, now that we've got to go to the Japanese man right away.

750
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,801
Let me see.

751
00:58:50,441 --> 00:58:52,721
Okay.

752
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:03,200
And you find out about the Japanese man by looking at Hiroshima, which we did a little already.

753
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,320
All action.

754
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,400
Now comes the big insight into Hiroshima.

755
00:59:08,401 --> 00:59:15,121
I know there's a place where some student hit me over the head maybe 20 years ago and saved me from total stupid interpretation.

756
00:59:15,121 --> 00:59:27,361
I mean, I thought that Hiroshima was like the flowers and the fish, that it came back even more full of life and full of light and so forth than it ever was before.

757
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:30,400
And I thought, gee, that's, I mean, I had no opinion.

758
00:59:30,401 --> 00:59:32,881
I just thought that's what the movie was about.

759
00:59:32,881 --> 00:59:37,440
And that turns out to be completely wrong about Hiroshima.

760
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:45,601
I mean, that, I mean, in fact, I led about 10 years of students astray, telling them that Hiroshima was lower immediacy.

761
00:59:45,601 --> 00:59:46,880
But why isn't it?

762
00:59:46,881 --> 00:59:47,601
You tell me.

763
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,601
What should I have seen?

764
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:53,280
You almost get hit over the head with it by the way, the movie is done.

765
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,001
Yeah.

766
00:59:56,561 --> 00:59:58,081
Yeah, okay, yes.

767
00:59:58,081 --> 00:59:59,360
But right, that's right.

768
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:04,481
The Japanese man is a knight of faith, and he's Hiroshima, that's in the last lines of the movie.

769
01:00:04,481 --> 01:00:07,440
But I'm trying to understand now what it is to be a knight of faith.

770
01:00:07,441 --> 01:00:08,800
What is the Japanese man?

771
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,561
And you have to look at the city to find out.

772
01:00:10,561 --> 01:00:12,080
First, you and then you, yeah.

773
01:00:16,561 --> 01:00:17,440
Absolutely.

774
01:00:17,441 --> 01:00:19,121
That's the important thing.

775
01:00:19,121 --> 01:00:22,081
That the camera dwells on the hotel name.

776
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:22,960
Remember it?

777
01:00:22,961 --> 01:00:24,481
What's the name of the hotel?

778
01:00:24,481 --> 01:00:25,760
The new Hiroshima.

779
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:30,320
They didn't just rename it the Hiroshima or name it the Hilton.

780
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,880
They named it the new Hiroshima.

781
01:00:32,881 --> 01:00:33,521
And what else?

782
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,640
You're going to say something like that, too?

783
01:00:39,481 --> 01:00:40,121
That's right.

784
01:00:40,121 --> 01:00:42,680
They make peace movies there, as she was in.

785
01:00:42,921 --> 01:00:44,921
The museum is there.

786
01:00:44,921 --> 01:00:56,200
Everything, they take over the disaster and they incorporate it into a way that they can go on living happily but not forget it.

787
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,960
And that's why they're not lower natures.

788
01:00:57,961 --> 01:00:59,241
They don't forget it.

789
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:02,280
They do something else with it, which we haven't really fully understood yet.

790
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:03,001
Yeah.

791
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,800
We don't joke about the.

792
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:22,440
That's good.

793
01:01:22,441 --> 01:01:23,000
That's right.

794
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,440
Add that to the list.

795
01:01:24,441 --> 01:01:27,081
I mean, they take this very seriously.

796
01:01:27,081 --> 01:01:38,601
By the way, in case I forget to say, it's interesting, his job is to, politics is to, you know, prevent this bad thing from happening again, presumably, and architecture.

797
01:01:38,601 --> 01:01:39,880
I mean, rebuild the city.

798
01:01:39,881 --> 01:01:42,201
He's all part of the new Hiroshima.

799
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:45,961
And her job is so perfect for her.

800
01:01:45,961 --> 01:01:50,361
Well, her job is to constantly reenact the disaster.

801
01:01:50,921 --> 01:01:57,561
She's a professional person, preserving as vividly as possible the disaster.

802
01:01:57,561 --> 01:02:04,041
Okay, so now let me go back to Hiroshima because I'm getting nervous that I won't get you the deep insight about him.

803
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,960
That's the new Hiroshima.

804
01:02:05,961 --> 01:02:13,401
And that's related to the puzzle, which I'm going to try to now give you at least the first glimpse of on page 65 in Fear and Trembling.

805
01:02:13,401 --> 01:02:21,601
The crucial mysterious lines that you wonder, remember, now you wonder about Abraham.

806
01:02:20,441 --> 01:02:24,320
You think Abraham is a knight of faith.

807
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:30,001
He thinks Isaac won't be sacrificed because he has faith, and God wouldn't do that, you think.

808
01:02:30,001 --> 01:02:33,840
And yet, you ask yourself, but what if Isaac were sacrificed?

809
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,080
Which is the same as what if you lose your lover?

810
01:02:36,081 --> 01:02:37,680
What if your lover dies?

811
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:38,801
What happens then?

812
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,640
Well, Kierkegaard faces it.

813
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:46,400
He says, about 15 lines from the bottom of 65, we let Isaac actually be sacrificed.

814
01:02:46,401 --> 01:02:47,921
Abraham had faith.

815
01:02:47,921 --> 01:02:55,040
His faith was not that he could be happy sometime in the hereafter, that he should find blessed happiness here in this world.

816
01:02:55,041 --> 01:02:56,640
See, that's what she gave up.

817
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:59,121
God would give him a new Isaac.

818
01:02:59,121 --> 01:03:02,321
Bring the sacrificial offer back to life.

819
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,320
What can that mean?

820
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:08,081
Well, Kierkegaard doesn't really know what it means himself.

821
01:03:08,081 --> 01:03:14,080
He knows that there's something going on there, but Kierkegaard is writing from the point of view of Johannes de Salentio.

822
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:17,041
And Johannes de Salentio is a knight of resignation.

823
01:03:17,041 --> 01:03:22,401
And he doesn't understand the knight of faith, except that there's something wonderful going on that he doesn't understand.

824
01:03:22,401 --> 01:03:27,121
Just as she doesn't understand the Japanese man, except that there's something strange going on there.

825
01:03:27,121 --> 01:03:35,201
And she doesn't understand the city, because what she sees in the city is the museum and the peace parade and so forth.

826
01:03:35,601 --> 01:03:38,480
But there are two ways to get a new Isaac.

827
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:40,640
One of them is wrong.

828
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:43,441
Bring the sacrificial offer back to life.

829
01:03:43,441 --> 01:03:49,121
I doubt if any of you have seen a movie called Ordette by the great Danish director Dreyer, have you?

830
01:03:49,121 --> 01:03:57,360
Well, it's a story about a guy who reads a lot of Kierkegaard, and then a woman dies, who is an important woman.

831
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,360
It isn't his law, but it doesn't matter.

832
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,360
And she's in the coffin dead.

833
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:11,720
And this guy who's been reading Kierkegaard stands at the bottom of the coffin and thinks hard that all things are possible and that Isaac could, what do we put it, be brought back to life.

834
01:04:11,721 --> 01:04:14,440
And the lady gets up and walks out of the coffin.

835
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:15,800
That's not it.

836
01:04:16,841 --> 01:04:20,600
It is not going to break the laws of physics and chemistry.

837
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,081
Whatever it is, you get a new Isaac.

838
01:04:23,081 --> 01:04:25,720
You don't really get the old Isaac back.

839
01:04:25,721 --> 01:04:28,760
But you don't betray the old Isaac either.

840
01:04:28,761 --> 01:04:30,360
How do you do it?

841
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:40,760
Well, I think we can see what Kierkegaard all upset about Regina couldn't see, that there's one movement that he hasn't talked about, and that's grief.

842
01:04:40,761 --> 01:04:44,600
And grief is going to do the job that we need to do.

843
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,041
What you want is the fine.

844
01:04:48,041 --> 01:04:53,081
You can't forget the first love or the first Isaac.

845
01:04:53,081 --> 01:04:56,200
They've got to stay and be definitive of you.

846
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,081
But they're gone.

847
01:04:57,081 --> 01:04:57,961
They're sacrificed.

848
01:04:57,961 --> 01:05:00,041
They're dead on the story we're considering.

849
01:05:00,041 --> 01:05:01,880
So what can you do?

850
01:05:01,881 --> 01:05:09,400
You can take them over into you, in the jargon of therapy, internalize them.

851
01:05:09,721 --> 01:05:15,320
And then you will be open to relate to somebody else, a new Isaac.

852
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:29,001
But you won't have betrayed the old one, and this is the crucial part, and it's perfect in the movie, because you will not only, you won't remember the first Isaac, the first love, you'll do something deeper than that.

853
01:05:29,001 --> 01:05:38,041
If you internalize it, you will relate to everything in terms of having loved and lost this first one.

854
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,520
You see, that's exactly what he's doing.

855
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:44,680
He, let's suppose now he had some love and this love died.

856
01:05:44,681 --> 01:05:46,520
He's not thinking about her.

857
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:55,360
Just as he's not thinking about all the bad things that happened in Hiroshima, he's not saying, let me show you where our house was and where my love was killed and my family died.

858
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:58,160
And he doesn't even accompany her to the museum.

859
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:59,121
That's not his business.

860
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,280
That's not as interesting to him.

861
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:08,800
But he sees her and understands her perfectly through his first disaster.

862
01:06:09,121 --> 01:06:12,081
He also does his politics through his first disaster.

863
01:06:12,081 --> 01:06:13,680
In fact, it's in a little detail.

864
01:06:13,681 --> 01:06:19,840
He knows French and can talk to her because of politics, which in turn is because of the first disaster.

865
01:06:19,841 --> 01:06:28,961
And now, I have a way of putting this, which I discovered when I was teaching at MIT, where they don't understand anything if you don't write it in sort of algebraic form.

866
01:06:28,961 --> 01:06:34,640
So, what I want to do gets, no, I don't want that.

867
01:06:34,641 --> 01:06:40,081
So, you, and I, of course, can't remember any algebraic form, but it's on your thing here.

868
01:06:40,081 --> 01:06:41,680
It's called the MIT version.

869
01:06:41,681 --> 01:06:44,320
You must have wondered at the bottom what in the world that meant.

870
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:49,600
Okay, here's the MIT version: X has a defining commitment for Y.

871
01:06:49,921 --> 01:06:51,440
That's fine.

872
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,160
Now, and now Y dies.

873
01:06:54,160 --> 01:07:10,720
Okay, the night of resignation, this is now the night of resignation, idealizes Y, puts Y into this otherworldly, perfect bracket where they can remember Y forever, right?

874
01:07:10,961 --> 01:07:13,680
Okay, but what else could you do?

875
01:07:13,681 --> 01:07:16,160
You could have X sub Y.

876
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,881
That means you internalize Y.

877
01:07:18,881 --> 01:07:20,961
Y becomes part of you.

878
01:07:20,961 --> 01:07:27,680
And then, this is the night of faith, you're open to a new, new whoever.

879
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:33,760
A new Isaac, in the case of the Japanese man, you're open to the French woman.

880
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,640
But the grief is completely paranoxical.

881
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:45,480
Remember now we've got to talk about paradoxes and how there's the, what's the other word, absurdity and so forth.

882
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:50,840
If you experience grief, you've got the following experience, if you do it right.

883
01:07:50,841 --> 01:07:53,320
I mean, she also had grief, but she did it wrong.

884
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,760
She got stuck in it.

885
01:07:54,761 --> 01:07:56,440
What is the way to do it right?

886
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:04,360
Well, you've got to really suffer the fact that you lost the only person that could ever really define who you are.

887
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,920
And you're never going to find anybody like that again.

888
01:08:06,921 --> 01:08:11,881
They're not just the smartest, sexiest, prettiest, handsomest person in the world.

889
01:08:11,881 --> 01:08:13,880
They're the world-defining person.

890
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:16,360
And they're gone, and so is your world.

891
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:20,760
And everything is gray, as Augustine says, and nothing has any meaning.

892
01:08:20,761 --> 01:08:25,880
And now you can make sort of the Augustine move, which is like her move.

893
01:08:25,881 --> 01:08:27,881
And no, sorry, forget that.

894
01:08:27,881 --> 01:08:29,640
Augustine doesn't even get as far as she.

895
01:08:29,721 --> 01:08:33,480
You make her move, and you can idealize the relation.

896
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:34,440
We saw that.

897
01:08:35,001 --> 01:08:45,640
But in grief, you both feel that you would never be able to have another love like that again, and that you will have another love like that again.

898
01:08:45,641 --> 01:08:49,400
That you can't, that somehow everything is going to be all right.

899
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:50,520
That's faith.

900
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:55,640
Faith is, in his Kierkegaard jargon, for God all things are possible.

901
01:08:55,641 --> 01:09:00,760
And that means, you know, in Kierkegaard, for God, even the impossible is possible.

902
01:09:00,761 --> 01:09:05,480
But that doesn't mean getting out of the coffin like in the Fryer movie.

903
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:09,961
It means that you can have an experience which is contradictory.

904
01:09:09,961 --> 01:09:17,880
You can be in grief, and you really have to suffer the fact that this is over for good and not hang on to it.

905
01:09:17,881 --> 01:09:21,880
Let it become part of you, however, which is this.

906
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:36,480
Take it up into your whole life, as important as it ever was, but change it from being an object that you love to being part of you on the basis of which you love again.

907
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:39,920
You can do that, but it's not a thing you can think.

908
01:09:39,921 --> 01:09:45,600
You can't think to yourself, well, good, let's go through this grief because if I do it right, everything's going to turn out all right.

909
01:09:46,801 --> 01:09:48,801
That's rational, but it's crazy.

910
01:09:48,801 --> 01:09:49,840
It won't work.

911
01:09:50,081 --> 01:09:51,921
You've got to really believe this is it.

912
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:52,881
My world is gone.

913
01:09:52,881 --> 01:09:53,921
My identity is gone.

914
01:09:53,921 --> 01:09:54,720
It's over.

915
01:09:54,721 --> 01:09:57,280
And that's terrible.

916
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:02,400
And you've got to never give up your, in Kierkegaard language, faith.

917
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,921
And what is your faith?

918
01:10:03,921 --> 01:10:08,961
That even though you can't understand this move, you can do it.

919
01:10:08,961 --> 01:10:11,360
And you don't think to yourself, oh, well, I'm going to do it now.

920
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:14,720
I'm going to have faith in it, and I'm going to do it right, and everything's going to come out all right.

921
01:10:14,721 --> 01:10:15,680
You just do it.

922
01:10:15,681 --> 01:10:24,560
You have faith, meaning you go through this grief and you remain open to another love because you can internalize it.

923
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:31,280
That's what it means to say that Abraham had faith, and that meant that God would give him a new Isaac.

924
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,840
And that's what Hiroshima does.

925
01:10:33,841 --> 01:10:39,360
Hiroshima becomes a new city, takes on and keeps the old.

926
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:48,640
Everything, let's say, an extreme that happens in Hiroshima happens in the sort of presence of the ruin that's in the skill.

927
01:10:48,641 --> 01:10:53,760
Isn't there a ruin preserved in the city of the disaster and so forth?

928
01:10:53,761 --> 01:11:08,121
Okay, so that's the way you can keep your defining commitment, keep your identity, and so forth.

929
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:11,480
I've got a slogan for this, which helps a lot to remember it.

930
01:11:11,801 --> 01:11:15,720
She's dwelling on her relation to the German.

931
01:11:16,041 --> 01:11:21,480
He is dwelling in his relation to, let's say, whoever.

932
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:25,480
I don't know a Japanese first name for the lady in his life.

933
01:11:25,961 --> 01:11:34,440
And the point is, see, dwelling in it is another way of saying he has internalized it and sees everything in terms of it.

934
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:39,240
And that makes him able to do something that she can't do.

935
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:40,680
Now I've just got time.

936
01:11:40,921 --> 01:11:41,640
And we'll see.

937
01:11:42,041 --> 01:11:44,280
Of course, that's what's happening in the end.

938
01:11:46,041 --> 01:11:49,480
She sees him lost in wonder.

939
01:11:49,641 --> 01:11:55,160
I think that's exactly the way the Salentio sees the Knight of Faith.

940
01:11:55,160 --> 01:12:00,600
He doesn't understand it, but he knows that it's a wonderful thing to do, but he knows that he can't do it.

941
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,200
She sees the same.

942
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:13,320
And then she says to him, Hiroshima, and he says, and he says, yes, that's my name.

943
01:12:13,641 --> 01:12:20,280
And she never fully understands it, but she knows that he's this thing she can't have and this super thing.

944
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:22,041
And he is just like the city.

945
01:12:22,041 --> 01:12:26,200
He's taken over the disaster and gone on somehow.

946
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:30,600
And then he says, and your name is Never, Never in France.

947
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:40,280
And that means she's taken on this role of the dead city, of stuck in the past, the gray, but that's the only thing she can do.

948
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:42,121
Now, I got three minutes.

949
01:12:42,121 --> 01:12:45,480
I think I'm ready to say the final thing.

950
01:12:46,121 --> 01:12:47,720
Let me see now.

951
01:12:48,681 --> 01:12:50,600
So she can be joyful.

952
01:12:50,921 --> 01:12:52,961
And I mean, he can be joyful.

953
01:12:52,961 --> 01:12:57,121
That's been, I say, see page 68 in here.

954
01:12:57,121 --> 01:12:58,961
Probably, I just read page 68.

955
01:12:52,041 --> 01:12:59,200
Okay.

956
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:08,480
Hmm.

957
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:09,360
Hold on.

958
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,400
What is 68?

959
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,840
That's interesting.

960
01:13:12,801 --> 01:13:14,240
No, I don't need that.

961
01:13:14,961 --> 01:13:15,921
Well, who knows?

962
01:13:15,921 --> 01:13:17,121
Maybe I need it in here.

963
01:13:17,121 --> 01:13:19,280
Too many page 68.

964
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:26,961
Well, I don't have time to explain it, and I'm not sure I've ever understood it.

965
01:13:26,961 --> 01:13:41,440
But in stage 68 of the scenario, he says, In a few years, when I'll have forgotten you, and when other such adventures from sheer habit will happen to me, I'll remember you as the symbol of love's forgetfulness.

966
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:44,560
I'll think of this adventure as of the horror of oblivion.

967
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:47,280
That is an amazingly hard-to-understand speech.

968
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:52,880
But what he's saying is that he'll forget her, but he'll remember her.

969
01:13:52,881 --> 01:13:54,240
And how will he remember her?

970
01:13:54,240 --> 01:14:02,480
Well, he'll remember her as the knight of resignation, who had this total, the anguish of forgetting, it says in the subtitles.

971
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:10,480
Okay, why I read that was, is that there's a special kind of remembering and forgetting.

972
01:14:10,641 --> 01:14:14,160
He manages to forget the object of his love.

973
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:22,081
He doesn't go on like that, but he forgets it, and he remembers it by taking it over.

974
01:14:22,081 --> 01:14:31,200
And I think he's taking over this whole experience with her as now part of his life and his way of relating to things and to people.

975
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,600
So let's see now.

976
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:37,121
Now, so he had a world destroying disaster.

977
01:14:37,641 --> 01:14:39,560
He wasn't a lower nature.

978
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,320
He didn't forget it.

979
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:43,480
And he isn't a knight of resignation.

980
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,560
So he must be a knight of faith.

981
01:14:46,041 --> 01:14:52,041
And that's why we never hear him talking about his disaster or paying any attention to his disaster.

982
01:14:52,041 --> 01:14:57,560
And now we understand what he says at the beginning.

983
01:14:57,641 --> 01:14:59,081
That's where I want to end up.

984
01:14:59,081 --> 01:15:02,121
Because let me show that it's okay.

985
01:15:02,761 --> 01:15:09,001
Let me step.

986
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:09,961
Yeah.

987
01:15:09,961 --> 01:15:10,440
Okay.

988
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:14,840
So remember how it begins and how differently now it's a brilliant thing?

989
01:15:14,841 --> 01:15:21,400
So when he says, you saw nothing in Hiroshima, nothing, and she says she saw everything, what does it mean?

990
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:28,121
It means she saw the facts about Hiroshima, but she didn't see that Hiroshima was a city which was a knight of faith.

991
01:15:28,121 --> 01:15:38,440
That it was something that had gone through a total disaster and gone on to be just as finite and temporal and joyful as before and took up the disaster.

992
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:42,600
Or to put it another way, is you understood nothing, remember?

993
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:50,600
He says, and she says, I always wept over the fate of Hiroshima, and he said, have to cry about.

994
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:54,520
Meaning, oh, by the way, that's important because he hasn't understood her yet either.

995
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,680
He doesn't understand her till she mentions Neveir.

996
01:15:56,681 --> 01:15:59,001
So he's giving her the, you're just a tourist.

997
01:15:59,001 --> 01:16:00,520
What do you have to cry about?

998
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:04,200
So everybody's saying things which turn out to be wrong.

999
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:10,041
But the main thing that turns out to be right, and now we're on the crucial thing on page 22.

1000
01:16:10,041 --> 01:16:12,760
She says, like you, I know what it is to forget.

1001
01:16:12,761 --> 01:16:14,680
No, you don't know what it is to forget.

1002
01:16:14,681 --> 01:16:15,240
You see?

1003
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:21,720
I mean, she thinks the only thing you either hang on to this or you forget it, and then your whole life just turns into meaninglessness.

1004
01:16:21,921 --> 01:16:30,081
He understands this deep kind of forgetting, where you stop thinking about the other person and dwelling on them and you dwell in them.

1005
01:16:30,081 --> 01:16:32,480
So she says, like you, I have a memory.

1006
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:33,121
I know what it is.

1007
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:34,720
He says, no, you don't have a memory.

1008
01:16:34,721 --> 01:16:36,081
That's the deep kind of memory.

1009
01:16:36,081 --> 01:16:38,001
You can't internalize it.

1010
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:47,200
And finally, yeah, I think I'm selfish.

1011
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:47,520
Good.

1012
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:48,560
His time is up.

1013
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:51,840
Okay, so now we see where that's it for that.
