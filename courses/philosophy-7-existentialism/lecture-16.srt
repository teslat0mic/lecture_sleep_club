1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,839
Now, let's go back to where we were, which is the structure of the argument, the Grand Inquisitor argument, which I said last time and which I say on the handout is an antinome.

2
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,879
And an antinomy has a thesis up a little bit, yeah.

3
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:30,559
Okay, it's funny because last time it was less up and it seemed okay, but now, how is it?

4
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:32,079
Can you hear me?

5
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:44,199
Okay, so we've got this antinomy, and we talked about the fact that there's always a thesis and antithesis, and it looks like they are the uh-oh, maybe that's just my jacket.

6
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:45,119
Let's see.

7
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:59,159
And it looks like they're the only alternatives, and each one seems so absolutely unacceptable and unintelligible or outrageous in whatever way, and it looks like the only alternative is to take the other one.

8
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,559
And the only way out of an antinomy is that there must be a third one.

9
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:15,400
Because obviously, if both of these options are unacceptable and you've got to do something, let's hope there's something else, other way of looking at what you should do.

10
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,319
Well, I'm just going to review because I didn't have the page handy.

11
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,120
The way the it's funny, we got a big echo over there.

12
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,320
Let's try.

13
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,439
Isn't that too loud?

14
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,039
Or only when I look down?

15
00:01:28,279 --> 00:01:29,159
You'd never.

16
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,559
Okay, if it's all right with you, it's all right with me.

17
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:40,680
On 239, I'm just setting up the alternatives.

18
00:01:40,680 --> 00:02:02,920
The alternatives are the Grand Inquisitor, who is clearly a kind of a caricature of the Roman Catholic Church, but not just any old caricature, but a kind of extrapolation of the worst features that you could imagine, as the sort of what the church is tending toward, Dostoevsky thinks, since he doesn't like the Catholic Church.

19
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:11,719
And the other one is, and that's what you have to figure out between the lines practically, is the Protestant form of Christianity.

20
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:19,159
But he puts it in right at the beginning, on 239 at the bottom, because he places this in the 16th century.

21
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:25,480
And the 16th century is the time of the Protestant revolt.

22
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,520
And then on 241, he comes back to it, just in case you didn't notice.

23
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:36,599
I mean, because a lot of things happened in that century, but here's what he's interested in: about 10 lines down.

24
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,080
And just then there appeared in the north of Germany a terrible new heresy.

25
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:47,680
Okay, that's Luther, the terrible new heresy, and that's the other column in the chart.

26
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:56,559
So you and one more thing, all of this is obvious, but just to put us back in the right frame of mind, the Grand Inquisitor does a lot of talking.

27
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:58,319
In fact, he does all the talking.

28
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,879
Jesus doesn't say anything.

29
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,240
But that's not at all important for what we're interested in, because we're interested in these two positions.

30
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,879
And so I'm just going to say Jesus says this, and the Grand Inquisitor says that.

31
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:22,079
If I were being accurate, I would have to say, Yvonne says that the Grand Inquisitor says that Jesus says such and such, because it's being written by Yvonne.

32
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,800
But I can't go through that every time.

33
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,999
It will never get done.

34
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:27,920
And it doesn't matter.

35
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,840
It doesn't matter whether Jesus ever said it.

36
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,639
It doesn't even matter whether the Protestants really believe it.

37
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:40,800
It's an extrapolation of an extreme form of the Protestant position practically to absurdity and off the chart.

38
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:47,759
And yet, and this is what's most amazing, I will quote you quotes from Kierkegaard that are just like this.

39
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,680
So Dostoevsky hasn't really gone off the rails.

40
00:03:51,680 --> 00:04:02,319
He's imagined a certain extreme form of Protestantism as the other alternative in this debate.

41
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,280
So where are we?

42
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:05,999
Well, we're ready for the third alternative.

43
00:04:05,999 --> 00:04:12,160
So, and I think somebody said already at the end last time what it was, but I'm not sure.

44
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,439
Did we get to that?

45
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,360
Or are we now at the, we didn't.

46
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,080
Okay, good.

47
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,199
Then we're at the question: what's the third alternative?

48
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,879
I think I wrote it here, so it's not going to be a big secret.

49
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:28,199
I wish I could write on the board, I wouldn't hand out this chart until I had written it on little by little.

50
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:49,800
But anyway, the third alternative is the Russian Orthodox Church, a third interpretation of Christianity, which Dostoevsky thinks is largely right, though he's ready to rewrite it when it doesn't fit his existentialized understanding of what the basic Christian experiences are.

51
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,000
But basically, sort of cleaned up a bit, he's all for the Russian Orthodox Church.

52
00:04:54,999 --> 00:05:27,079
In fact, he thinks that it will save the world because it's the only branch of Christianity that is, I think he thinks, though I don't know where he says it anywhere, sort of true to the original inspiration of Christianity, unmessed up by philosophy and Platonism in any way, and uncommitted to any supreme being and committed to understanding a certain way of life that Jesus exemplified.

53
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:38,920
And because the Russian Orthodox Church has somehow been far enough out of touch to not be Platonized, it's got a better chance of getting Christianity right.

54
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,559
That's what getting it right isn't the game.

55
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:50,279
I mean, whereas the question is, does Christianity have a deep understanding of what human beings need like?

56
00:05:50,519 --> 00:06:01,719
And then you can see all this list of things they need, bread, community, and under morality, confessions, and miracles.

57
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:09,480
That all of that is something, once it's existentialized, that you will see that human beings need all that.

58
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:18,480
And that the Russian Orthodox Church, sort of exemplified in Father Zosima, has an understanding of all that.

59
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:30,639
And all it needs, besides Zosima, is somebody like Ali Osher to take it out into the world and actually live it, and this will transform the world.

60
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:37,999
How that could be possible, how somebody sensible like Dostoevsky could have such a view, it takes a long time to work out.

61
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:43,920
But he does, and he brilliantly makes it seem almost plausible.

62
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,920
So there we are, ready to start.

63
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:52,079
Anyone want to say anything about the overall picture before we plunge into details?

64
00:06:52,080 --> 00:07:10,240
Because the project for today is to go through the Grand Inquisitor story and set up these antinomies so that in the next lecture we can talk about how the Russian Orthodox Church solves these antinomies, which will take several lectures because it's all spread all over the book.

65
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,199
Anything about that?

66
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,519
Okay, then let's go on.

67
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:40,320
Now, I mentioned last time how everybody gets most readers get it wrong, particularly if you read the Grand Inquisitor story out of context, it certainly looks like it's supposed to be some kind of extreme existentialist, sort of Sarkrean praise of Jesus as the person who understood the necessity of and the burden of total freedom.

68
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,680
But even in context, people like Verdayev get it wrong.

69
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:50,240
And what's interesting to me is that it's no surprise they get it wrong.

70
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:58,439
It's presented in such a way that it looks like, well, I don't know what it looks like.

71
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:01,720
Different people, some people think it looks like the Grand Inquisitor is right.

72
00:07:55,279 --> 00:08:04,280
Some people think it looks like Jesus is right.

73
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:12,680
Nobody seems to, that I've read, seems to think that maybe there's a third alternative and that neither of them are right, that people get trapped into the antinomy.

74
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:21,480
By the way, whenever I say I haven't read that much of secondary stuff about Dostoevsky, and I don't recommend at all that you go out and read any of it.

75
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,080
The chances of it getting anything right are not too high.

76
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:40,920
But in case you do read something and it does say the kind of thing I've been saying, please tell me about it, because I'm ready to give credit to whoever's got this and learn from anybody who's got a deeper grasp of it than I have.

77
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,920
I just haven't found them yet.

78
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,480
And they're probably out there somewhere in some language.

79
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,280
So if you find anybody, let me know.

80
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:56,120
Meanwhile, Dostoevsky understood that people weren't going to understand what was going on in the Grand Inquisitor story.

81
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:09,880
To my amazement, I found a letter quoted by him, a letter by him, quoted in a book by a guy named Bellenhap, whom I don't know who that is, but and it's a letter.

82
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:15,720
You have to know that this book came out in installments and was, you had to sort of subscribe to it.

83
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,680
And that's how Dostoevsky wrote his books.

84
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:22,120
And that's, I guess, how lots of people wrote their books in those days.

85
00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:26,520
And so he, he, there's, and there are these cliff-hanging breaks.

86
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:40,680
So after the Grand Inquisitor story, and before, long before, that you hear about the views of Zosima, Dostoevsky is beginning to try to tell you the third alternative.

87
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:47,600
But he knows that after the Grand Inquisitor story, people are going to not understand yet that there's a third alternative.

88
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:58,400
And he says in his letter: as my answer to all this negative side, I've planned the sixth book, A Russian Monk, and I'm trembling for it in this way.

89
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:06,640
Will it be an adequate answer, especially since it's not a direct answer to the stand expressed in the Grand Inquisitor point?

90
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:18,720
Because it's not a direct answer to the stand expressed in the Grand Inquisitor point by point, but only obliquely.

91
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,280
You'll see how wonderfully oblique it is as we go through.

92
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:31,520
I'll show you, and you'll see once you start playing this game, where he's hidden the answer, sort of like Easter eggs all around the book.

93
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:38,480
And as usual, he will sort of hit you over the head with it if you're watching for the clue and say, here, you see, I've done it now.

94
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,080
You got this one.

95
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,839
And the best one I'm saving.

96
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,680
I forget whether I'm saving it to last or not.

97
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,559
I imagine I am.

98
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,440
We'll see.

99
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,720
Anyway, I said this once before.

100
00:10:50,720 --> 00:11:04,399
How in the world is he going to deal with miracles and show you a miracle which is somehow doesn't break the laws of physics and chemistry, which is what you would think miracles normally do.

101
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,120
But that's jumping way ahead of the story.

102
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
So let me go back to where we are.

103
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,960
Now, he puts it in this biblical context.

104
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:25,600
That's the next thing, which is just sort of makes it a little more hard to follow, but it's a kind of nice literary move.

105
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,480
He wants to map it onto the three offers of Satan, the three temptations of Jesus.

106
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:36,039
That's how he's going to divide up his antinomies.

107
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:45,160
I mean, there's going to be a whole lot of, there's going to be a different standoff, a different antinome for each of the three temptations.

108
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:57,640
And the first temptation is that Jesus should turn stones to bread and thereby become a world leader by founding a kind of state church.

109
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:01,560
And no, that's the second one, sorry.

110
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:07,560
The first one is he will turn stones to bread, and that will solve the world hunger problem.

111
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:10,120
Second, he's tempted.

112
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,079
That's the first temptation.

113
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:18,360
The second temptation is that he could become a world leader and found a universal church.

114
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:25,560
And the third one is he will get people to believe in him by performing miracles.

115
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,240
I've changed the order.

116
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:34,040
The way Dostoevsky takes it up, he does bread, miracles, and then church.

117
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:36,040
But I forget why.

118
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:38,120
I decided I wanted to do it this way.

119
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:47,160
The Grand Inquisitor, and here's the overall antinomy that is behind all the particular ones.

120
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:53,720
The Grand Inquisitor claims that human beings are weak, worthless, rebellious.

121
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:59,159
They're like the lackey insect base side of the self.

122
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,040
That's their real nature.

123
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:22,560
You hear that every once in a while, but just to take one of the places where he says it, on 246, in the end of that top paragraph, men are, or just they are, weak, vicious, worthless, and rebellious.

124
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:36,320
A little further, thou didst promise them the bread of heaven, but I repeat, can it be compared with earthly bread in the eyes of the weak, ever sinful, and ignoble race of men?

125
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,720
So the Grand Inquisitor has a very dim idea of human beings and what you can expect of them.

126
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,080
Whereas Jesus has a very high idea, like what I said about the idiot.

127
00:13:48,080 --> 00:14:12,960
Remember, Yvonne is telling us a story in which he's supposed to be showing the totally wrong-headed idea of a completely pure Jesus who is totally innocent and is no way tied up with original sin or the evil in the world.

128
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,599
And Dostoevsky thinks that's impossible.

129
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,720
If Jesus is man, is a man, then he must be tied up with the evil in the world.

130
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:28,640
And only if he were, had experienced the evil in the world could he help the other people who were evil to get out of their evilness.

131
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:46,480
But the Jesus that Yvonne is portraying and who's causing a lot of trouble, that's the Grand Inquisitor's job to fix, that Jesus is making this totally impossible demand on people.

132
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,640
He wants them to be noble, pure, and totally free.

133
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,999
249 at the bottom.

134
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:21,960
And the Grand Inquisitor admits that there are some people who are strong enough to be free of all, to live on practically no food, to freely direct their lives without any dependence on miracle or on the church, to be able to live in total isolation and in total freedom.

135
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:34,440
There are such people, but they're very few, and it doesn't do any good for all the millions of other people that there are these few, because Jesus is expecting everybody to behave like that.

136
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:50,280
And the Grand Inquisitor says, well, he behaved like that, and a few other people, but that's not going to do people any good to ask them all to be self-sufficient, able to live alone on roots and berries and without miracles and without a church and so forth.

137
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:54,840
He's saying this at the bottom of 249.

138
00:15:55,159 --> 00:16:00,120
They, that's the people like him, had borne thy cross.

139
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:06,120
They had endured scores of years in the barren, hungry wilderness, living upon locusts and roots.

140
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:14,039
And thou mayest indeed point with pride at those children of freedom, of free love, of free and splendid sacrifice for thy gain.

141
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,879
But remember, there were only thousands, and what of the rest?

142
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:31,399
So his claim is that Jesus is asking of everybody to do what only a very few rare, super ascetic people can do.

143
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:49,840
And remember, Yvonne in the background is making it look as if Jesus, as he describes him in his story, is so perfect that he has no sympathy for the weak, worthless, rebellious human beings.

144
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,959
And so the Grand Inquisitor understands his job is to help humanity out.

145
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:10,719
He's going to change Jesus' Christianity into a Christianity that every normal human being can live and live in happily and get a lot out of life.

146
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:25,999
And that's the job of the Roman Catholic Church, to correct the big deal mistake that Jesus made because he was so pure, not understanding what you have to do for human beings and what you can expect from human beings.

147
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,639
This is all, he says it on 244.

148
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,360
Where?

149
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,840
Oh, I'm not looking at 244.

150
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,879
The middle of 244.

151
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:56,479
For 15 centuries, we've been wrestling with thy freedom, and now it's ended and over for good.

152
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,760
And then skipping down to the paragraph, the next big paragraph, no, not at all.

153
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:11,919
He claims it is a merit for himself, this is Yvonne explaining, and his church, that at last they vanquish freedom and have done so to make men happy.

154
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:22,639
And that tells you sort of the general position of the Grand Inquisitor on the one hand and the general position of Jesus on the other.

155
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:35,959
And they're dealing with, and another way to put it, and it's sort of interesting, you see Yvonne, in a way, is the natural one to be writing it, they're dealing with the two sides of the self.

156
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:38,999
They've each got only one half of the factors.

157
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:48,439
The Grand Inquisitor thinks that everybody is insect and sodom and, I forget, lackey, and base, bad.

158
00:18:49,159 --> 00:19:01,639
And Jesus thinks that everybody is free and lofty and good and like the Madonna, like an angel, and so forth.

159
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:07,239
And you can't get the two, you can't have both.

160
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:21,399
And that produces this antinomy, because each time you try to sort of run the whole world on one side or the other, you run up against the fact that, well, there is the other side of this, and these two sides are contradictory.

161
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:23,080
But they're both right.

162
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,519
Human beings are angels and insects.

163
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,039
They go in for Sodom and the Madonna.

164
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:35,320
They are lofty and lacy, and so forth.

165
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,760
And Dostoevsky understands that, of course, this conflict.

166
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:52,439
He calls it a conflict or a contradiction in the middle of page 245, where he says, in those three questions, those are what three questions?

167
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,439
I don't know.

168
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:55,879
Let's see.

169
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:07,159
Oh, those are the three temptations to turn the stones to bread, to set up an earthly kingdom, and to perform miracles to make people believe in him.

170
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:15,999
For those three questions, the whole subsequent history of mankind is, as it were, brought together into one whole, into one whole and foretold.

171
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,840
In them are united all the unsolved historical contradictions of human nature.

172
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:33,679
You can see why, the way I read it, I zap onto that sentence as the sort of evidence that Dostoevsky has the Kierkegaard-Pascal view of the self.

173
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,080
But there's things in that sentence that require me to talk about it a while.

174
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:44,080
It dawned on me only little by little how peculiar what he's saying there is.

175
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,760
He says that the historical contradictions of human nature.

176
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,360
You realize if you listen to that carefully, that's a contradiction.

177
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,399
I mean, because if it's the contradictions of human nature, it shouldn't be historical.

178
00:21:00,399 --> 00:21:08,159
It should have been there in the ancient Egyptians and in the Bali and in Japan and here, if that's the way human nature is, so it is.

179
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,159
But if it's historical, then it doesn't seem that it's human nature.

180
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:32,320
It seems like it's human culture that produces this, the way it seems that Jesus, or Kierkegaard thinks that Jesus coming along and being the God-man sort of produces human beings who have equal two factors who are equally essential, which the Greeks didn't have.

181
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:38,639
Well, I think the, I mean, I don't know whether this is Dostoevsky's making a mistake or whether he's saying something extremely deep.

182
00:21:38,639 --> 00:21:45,439
I suspect he doesn't know what he's saying, but since he's usually on to something, it's something he's on to something very deep.

183
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:47,360
And it's something Pascalian.

184
00:21:47,679 --> 00:22:03,800
Remember, I said one of the existentialist features of Pascal's thinking is that he says custom is our nature, meaning that human nature is a function of the particular culture that you grow up in.

185
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,439
Human beings, remember, I said that about Buddhists.

186
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:15,399
For all I know, Buddhists are different, have a different nature than we do, and they're not in despair when they get rid of the, try to get rid of the temple and the finite.

187
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:45,239
So, in any case, I think Dostoevsky knows that the kind of contradiction that he's setting up here between the lofty and the lacky, and between the earthy and the heavenly, where they're both essential and you can't get rid of either, is something that's caused in the history of our culture, and it's produced a certain human nature, which now we are, and we have to deal with it.

188
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:50,920
And the Grand Inquisitor and Jesus are sort of fighting over how to deal with it because it's a contradiction.

189
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:52,439
We're back to that again.

190
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:56,120
There's another interesting part of that sentence, which I just read.

191
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:01,399
He says, in them, in this contradiction, or in them what?

192
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,320
Oh, in the three questions.

193
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:10,999
I brought together the subsequent history of mankind and the unsolved historical contradictions of human nature.

194
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,840
Let's look at the unsolved historical contradictions.

195
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,120
That's interesting.

196
00:23:17,399 --> 00:23:22,439
The other translations say the insoluble.

197
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:24,919
I don't have my Russian person.

198
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:32,519
I believe the last time I asked a Russian person, they said it was the insolvable contradiction.

199
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:41,559
I hope that's, well, I don't care which it is, but it makes a big difference who's saying it.

200
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:55,039
If it's Dostoevsky saying, he better be saying the unsolved contradiction, because he thinks that if everything goes well, thanks to the Russian church, they will be solved.

201
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:03,120
Because everybody will come to live by the third possibility that Christianity has, but nobody's managed to work it out and live it yet.

202
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,959
So they are historical.

203
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:15,360
They started at a certain point, these contradictions, with Jesus, presumably, and they'll end at the point where Russia saves the world.

204
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,159
And I think that's what Dostoevsky thinks.

205
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,679
They're the unsolved historical contradictions.

206
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:27,040
Now, who could be saying that they're unsolvable if it reads the other way?

207
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,999
I'm prepared.

208
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,200
Whatever anybody tells me, I'm perfectly happy with the translation.

209
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:33,040
I just want to know which.

210
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:36,560
Why would it be okay if it said the unsolvable contradiction?

211
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,879
That wouldn't fit Dostoevsky's story very well.

212
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:47,439
That would leave there, you wouldn't have this Christian comedy, this optimism that if you go through enough suffering and anguish, everything is going to work out.

213
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,159
Who wrote this story of the Grand Inquisitor?

214
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:57,519
Who am I really quoting when I say the unsolved historical contradiction?

215
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,080
Exactly.

216
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,120
Who said this?

217
00:24:59,439 --> 00:24:59,999
Oh, good.

218
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,480
Oh, yeah.

219
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:00,719
Okay.

220
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:08,320
For Yvonne, it would be right to say unsolvable, of course, because poor Yvonne can't get the contradiction together in him.

221
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:10,559
He's trying to throw out half.

222
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:16,480
So he's not going to think that if you just become a good Russian Orthodox Christian, this is all going to work out all right.

223
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:19,120
He doesn't think it's a good idea to be a Christian at all.

224
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,000
And it's certainly not going to work out all right for Yvonne.

225
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,600
Now, I keep hinting that very bad things are going to happen by him and to him in the course of the book.

226
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:37,799
Okay, so now, having gone through all that one sentence, which seems to be pretty important, I will let me skim up to where I am.

227
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:55,320
Okay, yeah, I'm ready now to go back and start talking about the specific antinomies.

228
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,080
Go boom, boom.

229
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,720
I don't know.

230
00:25:57,719 --> 00:26:04,360
Okay, so on 249, no, that's all right.

231
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,159
That's just that there are the good people.

232
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:14,439
And on 248, there are the bad people, or the bad view of people, the unruly race of men.

233
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:16,919
I don't think I read the middle of 248, did I?

234
00:26:17,719 --> 00:26:20,759
Thou didst proudly and well like a god.

235
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:27,639
That's what the Grand Inquisitor says to Jesus: that the weak, unruly race of men, are they gods, and so forth.

236
00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:30,120
That's back, we're back to the antinomies.

237
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:41,879
And now we want to talk about people should be, and then you get one list, and that's godlike.

238
00:26:41,879 --> 00:26:43,000
Do I have this over here?

239
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,279
Yeah, under the thesis, what Jesus' Protestant thesis is: people should be godlike and they should be completely free.

240
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:53,479
Let's call that the lofty side.

241
00:26:53,479 --> 00:27:06,120
And then there's the anti-Jesus view of the Roman Catholic Church, which people are and can't help but be and will always be weak and slavish.

242
00:27:06,439 --> 00:27:20,239
Having put that, you can say that the antinomy then is, all is still without going into these specific details, is total freedom.

243
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:23,199
That's the Protestant side.

244
00:27:23,199 --> 00:27:29,200
And that is total freedom, total individuality, total independence.

245
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:31,360
That's what Jesus demands.

246
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,879
And the other side is slavery, dependence on authority, but happiness.

247
00:27:36,879 --> 00:27:39,999
That's what the Grand Inquisitor promises.

248
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,720
And if you look at them, you see that they're an antinomy.

249
00:27:42,719 --> 00:27:50,320
I mean, the idea of total autonomy, total individuality, total independence, total freedom, that's asking too much of any of them.

250
00:27:50,639 --> 00:28:06,959
And on the other hand, if the only alternative, and so we better find something else, the alternative seems to be, well, you've got to have a kind of an authority, a kind of state church which organizes everything and takes away everybody's freedom from them.

251
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:08,639
And that seems impossible.

252
00:28:08,639 --> 00:28:10,479
So you bounce back and forth.

253
00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:23,279
One, the total autonomy freedom story makes you believe in the, you need a dependence on an authority story, and this total slavish dependence on an authority story makes you think, well, that's not what human beings are.

254
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,840
They've got a certain amount of freedom, and you bounce back and forth.

255
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:35,919
And now the point is to do it with the specific issues, which is what I want to talk about the rest of the time.

256
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,920
But now maybe somebody has something to say.

257
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:44,879
I mean, I've been throwing a lot of stuff at you, or questions, or confusions, or anything.

258
00:28:44,879 --> 00:28:54,879
I can't believe it that this that people are just, everything is perfectly clear, and you agree with my reading of the book, and you agree with Dostoevsky, and you agree with Yvonne, you're in good shape.

259
00:28:54,879 --> 00:28:55,360
Okay.

260
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:39,639
He doesn't have to, because he sets it in the 15th century, and that's when they're very afraid of the Lutherans, and the Grand Inquisitors are out threatening Galileo with torture if he doesn't take back the, you know, he puts it at the moment when the sort of free freedom that Luther represents and the Luther's kind of claim that everybody's a pope and you don't need the Catholic Church was up against the Catholic Church, which was doing all it could to stamp out these bad guys.

261
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:42,919
And he comes back once more in the book, just in passing.

262
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:49,320
We'll see it today when it turns out the Lutherans are even prowling around in Russia trying to convert people.

263
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:55,000
That's a funny, funny idea, but it must have been true, I guess, or at least Yvonne puts it in.

264
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:12,120
Anyway, you don't need to know the history, I don't know myself, when the Grand Inquisitor really existed and how, what he really thought or anything like that, because it's supposed to be just two kinds, remember, don't lose track of the point.

265
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:29,639
Two extreme kinds of Christianity, each of which do justice only half of itself, are confronting each other and proposing two alternatives, which are always equally impossible to accept.

266
00:30:29,639 --> 00:30:33,160
And each one seems to say we have to accept the other.

267
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:35,240
That's the level at which to understand it.

268
00:30:35,239 --> 00:30:35,799
Yeah.

269
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:45,039
Do you think he's doing that on purpose?

270
00:30:46,560 --> 00:31:06,320
I don't think he thinks of the similarity to Jesus and Alyasha, but I think that you're on to something very interesting when you ask, isn't Yvonne, like the Grand Inquisitor, one of the people who is able to be free on his own, not in the church, not using, needing miracles, and so forth.

271
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:12,960
And the hint that he does, Yvonne does know that, is how the story ends.

272
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:19,760
Do you remember what happens after they have this, that the Grand Inquisitor has this debate with Jesus?

273
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:24,800
Okay, so they'll start with the first one.

274
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,879
See, I think it's very puzzling.

275
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,080
Why does Jesus kiss the Grand Inquisitor?

276
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:39,360
I mean, the Grand Inquisitor has spent all this time trying to undo Jesus' whole work and has gotten rid of their freedom and so forth.

277
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:50,800
Well, it looks like because Yvonne identifies with the Grand Inquisitor and thinks of himself and the Grand Inquisitor as the, what do I think?

278
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,239
Wait a minute.

279
00:31:52,879 --> 00:31:53,840
Just a second.

280
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,039
What I'm saying makes no sense, but I don't, but I don't understand why I'm saying it.

281
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:11,199
So Yvonne, see, when Yvonne has Jesus kiss the Grand Inquisitor, I think Yvonne is saying that there's something admirable about the Grand Inquisitor.

282
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:13,759
And Jesus recognizes that.

283
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,479
And that is that the Grand Inquisitor does all that he does for lofty motives.

284
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:27,120
And that he's ready to try to help everybody at a sort of very abstract level.

285
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:43,719
And Yvonne thinks of himself as having lofty motives and sort of being against children's suffering, though he doesn't go out and do anything about it, but he's sensitive to it and he sympathizes with going consciously at least about fixing it.

286
00:32:43,719 --> 00:32:46,199
Anyway, so I think you're absolutely on the right track.

287
00:32:46,199 --> 00:33:02,519
I think Yvonne thinks of himself as in some ways enough like the Grand Inquisitor that the Grand Inquisitor, that he has Jesus recognize that the Grand Inquisitor is onto something honorable.

288
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,759
Why?

289
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:14,679
And now Yvonne Alyasha is like Jesus, I think.

290
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:24,520
But I guess, let me, you want to say something about this?

291
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,480
Because I don't know what to say.

292
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,600
He's asking hard questions.

293
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,720
Go ahead.

294
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:48,600
I think it's going to be coming on Jesus, not like not having a response to anything that Jesus said, but actually that his silence speaks more than people, you know, far from the Grand Inquisition.

295
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:56,040
Also, kind of like not the future that's kind of round and talk so much about these people's being here so much as yourself.

296
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,439
The Grand Inquisitor is, that's what's good about him, I take it.

297
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:07,639
He really did sort of survive alone in the desert, he says, with freedom.

298
00:34:07,639 --> 00:34:15,199
And he has the strength not even to believe in God because he doesn't get coerced by miracles and so forth.

299
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,520
Yvonne likes that.

300
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,879
Are we disagreeing?

301
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:19,279
I don't know.

302
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:26,080
And I think I'm trying to say that I'm sort of agreeing with him that there's that we've got to make some sense of it.

303
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,639
I'll tell you why.

304
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,000
Let's put it on hold.

305
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,240
Because you jumped into this interesting issue.

306
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:38,639
Once we've discussed all the issues on both sides, let's ask ourselves again.

307
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:44,159
I'm certainly open to what I have never been convinced of any interpretation of it.

308
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:54,080
Let's ask ourselves again next time why, and you can think about it in the meantime, why does Yvonne have Jesus kiss the Grand Inquisitor?

309
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:58,800
And why does Alyasha kiss Yvonne?

310
00:34:58,799 --> 00:35:01,600
And then we'll get to see.

311
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,639
You want to say something about it?

312
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:03,280
Yeah.

313
00:35:15,759 --> 00:35:24,000
How did that work with the idea that you want to ask for these kinds of exact state and figure freedom?

314
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:25,439
Yes, that's right.

315
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,880
He says he could live on worms and mushrooms or something.

316
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:35,440
Okay, Father Farrapont's a very important figure in coming up in this discussion within the next ten minutes.

317
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,880
Just wait and see.

318
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:42,799
But it's he's he you have to bring him into the discussion because Dostoevsky didn't put him in there for nothing.

319
00:35:42,799 --> 00:35:47,040
In fact, there's everything in the book is there for some reason or other.

320
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,679
Yeah.

321
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,480
Well, I see what you mean.

322
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,320
Okay, let's think about that.

323
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,159
Yes.

324
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:11,960
That's right.

325
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,399
I know that's very strange, too.

326
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:21,320
The book, the story, Yvonne's story is framed in two very peculiar events that I don't claim to understand.

327
00:36:21,319 --> 00:36:32,360
One of them is that Jesus is performing a miracle at the very time that the Grand Inquisitor comes up to him and says, you have never, you don't perform miracles, you refuse to perform miracles.

328
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:34,360
I don't know what to think about that.

329
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:39,560
And the Grand Inquisitor knows that Jesus is the God-man.

330
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:45,959
And yet, he obviously doesn't believe that Jesus has got the power to do these things.

331
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,440
He's got the power to take back what Jesus is doing.

332
00:36:51,319 --> 00:37:03,560
I guess if I had to make up something, I'd say the Grand Inquisitor knows that Jesus is a very important human being, like the Hebrews think, prophet, and the Muslims too.

333
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:11,799
There's very important guy, and he came and he brought a very important message, but it was a bad message, and the Grand Inquisitor is fixing it.

334
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:16,359
How that relates to his miracle performing, I can't imagine.

335
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:20,600
But put those, it's amazing how you guys jump to the hardest things.

336
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,759
I think that's terrific.

337
00:37:22,759 --> 00:37:25,959
But we're going to come back to them, I promise, and think about that.

338
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:31,719
If anybody can understand how the miracle in the beginning, you know, it may just be a bump in Yvonne's story.

339
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:33,399
I mean, that's how I've always taken it.

340
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,879
I can't fit it into his story.

341
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,479
But if we could, that would be better.

342
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,439
You going to say something?

343
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,560
I saw you saw a hand up.

344
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:39,879
Yeah.

345
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,279
Yeah.

346
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,080
He takes advantage of one of the intentions.

347
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,679
He will say why would you kiss him for that?

348
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:06,399
Well, Alyosha, people like Alyosha is telling that it is not just his stories.

349
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:12,240
He won't take a role and live one of the roles, even if they seem to see.

350
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,600
Well, maybe.

351
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,560
Why don't you wait?

352
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,879
I mean, it can't hurt.

353
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,759
You want to say more?

354
00:38:19,759 --> 00:38:20,639
Because I don't know.

355
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:22,319
I have no opinion yet.

356
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:23,760
Go ahead.

357
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:29,839
Alyosha is going to be moved by the story.

358
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,919
We translate it into reality, you know?

359
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,960
We understand.

360
00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:34,639
I think that's right.

361
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:38,960
You're just trying to role.

362
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,639
You can't imagine this.

363
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:44,080
That Alyosha is really, really moved by it.

364
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,519
And it's more than just a story.

365
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,919
Alyasha is really moved by the story.

366
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,200
That's right.

367
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:53,919
And Yvonne is doing it as a kind of intellectual exercise.

368
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,600
That's what you're saying, too.

369
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,279
And Alyasha is.

370
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:12,159
Is kissing him an appropriate response to Alyasha's being moved by the story, which Yvonne is putting up as a kind of a put-down of the Jesus that Alyasha believes in?

371
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:14,960
That's, I don't know.

372
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,600
Wait and see.

373
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,159
Wait and see.

374
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,639
I wish I had a great answer that I'm just saying wait and see because I'm going to spring this on you later.

375
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:21,520
I don't know.

376
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,240
But we'll all try to figure it out later.

377
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:33,479
But the further you read and the more I've had a chance to lay out the Grand Inquisitor, the better chance we have of making sense of the two toughest things in it.

378
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,799
You get the last word on this.

379
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,320
Can you hear her?

380
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:57,159
The Grand Inquisitor had this view, this view is still outlook opposite again.

381
00:39:57,239 --> 00:40:05,639
It's not deal like whether or not he believes in God or whether or not he wants to believe God.

382
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,159
That's true.

383
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:14,120
It's not clear, let me repeat that if the Grand Inquisitor loves humanity or God or so forth.

384
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,319
Although, I mean, I must say, Yvonne wants us to believe that.

385
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:22,440
I mean, he wrote the story, and his Grand Inquisitor says he's doing it out of love of human beings.

386
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,600
I think we're supposed to believe that.

387
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:34,120
And I think we're supposed to believe in his lofty motives, because otherwise, why would Yvonne want to write this story?

388
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:41,799
He wants to show that Jesus is all wrong and driven the Roman church into this because they're good guys.

389
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,960
That's what Yvonne wants to show.

390
00:40:44,279 --> 00:40:46,759
But on the other hand, I mean, I don't know what to say.

391
00:40:46,759 --> 00:40:51,000
Yvonne is such a kind of player around with ideas.

392
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:58,359
And you'll see he ties up all those monks into nuts, which we have to talk about by this article he's written, if you've read far enough.

393
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:03,720
It took me years to figure out about the church becoming the state and the state becoming the church.

394
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:07,159
There's all a very deep, clever argument in there.

395
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:11,400
And there's a very deep, clever argument in the Grand Inquisitor story.

396
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,159
And what you're asking is sort of how seriously does Yvonne take it?

397
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:25,759
And we can't use as an argument to prove anything about what Yvonne thinks that Jesus comes up and kisses the Grand Inquisitor because that's inside of Yvonne's story.

398
00:41:25,759 --> 00:41:28,800
So is that part of this intellectual game?

399
00:41:28,799 --> 00:41:46,000
Or is that some Yvonne revealing how much he really identifies with the Grand Inquisitor and thinks that they're both sort of suffering because everybody else is such awful people and only they are pure, which is maybe what I don't know.

400
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,559
Stop.

401
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:50,080
I'd rather talk about something I can help you with.

402
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:53,600
I don't want to stop too.

403
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:56,880
I want all ready to come back to it because I want you to help me with it.

404
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,759
But right now, I can't do anything to make sense of what's going on.

405
00:42:01,759 --> 00:42:12,800
And everything everybody has said makes some sense, but none of it seems to me to nail, make an answer which everybody will say, aha, yeah, of course, that's what it meant all along.

406
00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:15,359
And I bet there is such an answer lurking.

407
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:21,200
But let's go do it one by one until we get back to the end, and then we'll ask about that.

408
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:33,840
I won't bring up the miracle on the steps of the church, but if anybody has any ideas about it, when we finish going through them all and when we finish going through miracles, you bring it up or come to my office and tell me about it.

409
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,839
Okay, now, here we go.

410
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:52,159
There's three kinds of issues: the economic issues based on turning the stones into bread, and that has all to do with sort of material satisfaction, how you have to set up and organize the world so that people have enough to eat.

411
00:42:52,159 --> 00:43:02,279
And then there are the issues around the community and the church, and how much everybody has to share in one religion, one system of beliefs.

412
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:08,600
And then there's this sort of grab bag, which I just called number three here on the chart, morality.

413
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:15,960
It has four components: confessions, miracles, mystery, and authority.

414
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,000
And I don't understand anything about mystery and authority.

415
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,439
There's certainly a possible paper topic in there for anybody.

416
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:41,559
Once you see how Dostoevsky finds the third way in all of the other antinomies, if anybody can find out what the antinome is of authority and the antinome is of mystery and what Dostoevsky's third way is, I'd love to know.

417
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,159
And I bet it's in here.

418
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:45,960
But I won't do it because I don't know it.

419
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:51,480
But I'll do all the others and maybe that will give you a chance to figure out the missing ones.

420
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,880
Or maybe they're just missing them.

421
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,639
All these many times I've read it and taught it, but I haven't found them yet.

422
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:00,440
There's a possibility that he just didn't do it.

423
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,200
Okay, let's go.

424
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:03,960
The economic issue.

425
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:08,360
That's, for better or for worse, that's the least interesting one.

426
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:14,280
Don't get bored by this one and turn off, because the other two are so fascinating.

427
00:44:14,279 --> 00:44:19,799
Then tie in, the other two tie in with important things we've been reading by Kierkegaard.

428
00:44:19,799 --> 00:44:32,080
This is sort of Dostoevsky off on his own, worrying about and predicting really the Soviet Union, communism, which he saw was coming in Russia and he was very worried.

429
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:38,679
Because this is about how you have to organize society so that everybody has enough to eat.

430
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:50,560
And the basic antinomy is that if people if you have a free enterprise, a free economy, then people won't have enough to eat, there'll be scarcity.

431
00:44:50,560 --> 00:45:02,400
And if you want a an economy in which everybody has all their material needs met, you're going to have to have a completely state-controlled socialism.

432
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:04,159
That's his antinomy.

433
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:05,759
It's an interesting antinomy.

434
00:45:05,759 --> 00:45:14,879
His solution is interesting, but it's all nothing that he's particularly original or gripping about, I don't think.

435
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,480
But let's just go over it.

436
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:28,319
So the first issue you can see at the bottom, 245, about 15 lines from the bottom.

437
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,880
Or not even that, maybe 10.

438
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:44,159
Turn these stones, that is, turn them into bread, and mankind will run after you like a flock of sheep, graceful and obedient, though forever trembling, yes, lest you withdraw the hand and deny them the bread.

439
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:51,760
This is to say, if you're in charge of the material well-being, you can get people to do whatever you want.

440
00:45:51,759 --> 00:45:58,799
And the Jesus figure says he wants people to be moral and free and give up material comforts.

441
00:45:58,799 --> 00:46:02,800
He demands total asceticism of people.

442
00:46:02,799 --> 00:46:06,560
And that's again in just going round the dialectic or the antinomy.

443
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:14,159
And the Grand Inquisitor says, yeah, but you can't expect people, normal people, to be ascetics and go out and live on roots and berries.

444
00:46:14,799 --> 00:46:27,720
So if you if you want people to be moral, you have to let uh feed people and give them the basis, give them a comfortable life, and then ask them to be moral.

445
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:32,440
I was just remembering the Brecht, the three-penny opera.

446
00:46:33,719 --> 00:46:39,719
First comes eating and then morality, only erst kums die fresen, nacher die morale.

447
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:47,480
Which is exactly the moral of what that's what the Grand Inquisitor is saying.

448
00:46:47,480 --> 00:47:01,159
So look at this now on 246, the five lines down: feed men and then ask of them virtue.

449
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,400
That's what the Grand Inquisitor says.

450
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:11,639
But the Grand Inquisitor says you can't feed them and give them freedom, both.

451
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:13,080
That's the end of that paragraph.

452
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,360
That's the important part.

453
00:47:14,359 --> 00:47:17,319
No science will give them bread so long as they remain free.

454
00:47:17,319 --> 00:47:21,479
In the end, they will lay their freedom at our feet and say, make us your slaves, but feed us.

455
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,799
That's what he thinks is going to happen when the communists take over in Russia.

456
00:47:25,799 --> 00:47:31,560
They will understand at last that freedom and bread enough for all are inconceivable together.

457
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:37,159
And that's probably true.

458
00:47:37,799 --> 00:47:54,439
That is, it looks like, I mean, it isn't as if we can say, well, now we know that the socialists took away all the freedom in Russia, and they did provide everybody with material minimum well-being, I take it.

459
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:58,040
There weren't slums and people below the poverty line in the Soviet Union.

460
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:03,319
There were just people afraid of the, what do you call them?

461
00:48:03,319 --> 00:48:07,720
People who were running around making sure that they didn't criticize the state.

462
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,120
What are the names of the state police?

463
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,679
I just can't remember.

464
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:18,239
Anyway, you know, they were afraid of whatever.

465
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:22,879
They were afraid that if they said anything, they'd be sent off to Siberia, and that's where they were.

466
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:34,080
So on the one hand, it looks like you could take away everybody's freedom, make a police state, and actually guarantee that there's nobody starving.

467
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,279
And that's what the Grand Inquisitor proposes.

468
00:48:37,279 --> 00:48:48,240
And he says it's incompatible with a free state where everybody can live where they want and work at whatever job they want and go to school or not go to school in college if they want.

469
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:55,520
It's not possible in such an economy that everybody will just be materially well off.

470
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,839
And that seems to be right too, roughly.

471
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:00,399
I mean, we've got a free economy.

472
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,960
Are there people in this very rich country below the poverty line?

473
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,319
Yes, there are lots of them.

474
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,879
Some of them sleeping on the streets of Berkeley.

475
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:11,520
And that's interesting.

476
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:16,639
Whether it's impossible to set up a state in which there is no slums and nobody.

477
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:20,320
I mean, the Scandinavians, I guess, come as near as anybody to doing it.

478
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:28,719
But Dostoevsky has a case that the Grand Inquisitor, Yvonne, whoever, has a case that it really does seem to be a trade-off.

479
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:47,919
You either need a total planned economy to talk like the Soviets, in which case everybody will be fed, or you need a free enterprise system, in which case there'll be this at least huge difference between the rich and the poor, in which the poor sort of fall below the line and aren't sufficiently fed.

480
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,360
That's the debate.

481
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,919
So, where are we?

482
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,040
So, look, did I read 246?

483
00:49:55,279 --> 00:49:56,480
I just did.

484
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:12,040
So, some people could practice asceticism, like the Grand Inquisitor.

485
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,999
But the majority of people are too weak to do that.

486
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,280
If everybody could live on roots and berries, then you could have a freedom for everybody.

487
00:50:20,279 --> 00:50:29,159
And they wouldn't, nobody would be starving below the poverty line, because everybody would be living as if they barely had enough food.

488
00:50:32,359 --> 00:50:36,520
But the majority of people are too weak to do that.

489
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,960
Funny, my notes are not right.

490
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,279
I'm too weak to do it.

491
00:50:42,279 --> 00:50:43,800
Just a second.

492
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:55,399
I guess I'm looking for this in the middle roughly of 248.

493
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:00,920
Thou didst proudly and well like God, but the weak, unruly race of men, are they gods?

494
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:01,479
Maybe.

495
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:02,759
Maybe not.

496
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:03,639
I don't know.

497
00:51:03,639 --> 00:51:06,919
It's all over the place, so I'm not going to worry to find it.

498
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:17,639
What I want to find is something else that, oh, but look what I did find, which I forgot to read.

499
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,120
I forgot, I lost it again.

500
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,999
I have to find something that's very important.

501
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,520
I'm amazed that I forgot to read it.

502
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:24,999
Look at this.

503
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Did I read this on 253?

504
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,440
I don't think I did.

505
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:35,080
This is the proof that the third thing is the Russian Orthodox Church, which is something you might well want me to give you.

506
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:35,959
I mean, it would.

507
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:39,639
That's amazing.

508
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:41,439
Let me just write it down on here.

509
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:47,999
On 253, that's the third possibility.

510
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,479
Okay, just so you know, I didn't make it up.

511
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,679
I showed you the Luther part.

512
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:53,840
The Grand Inquisitor part is obvious.

513
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:59,920
Now, look on 253, the beginning of that last big paragraph.

514
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:06,959
Never mind the first sentence, but then Alyasha says, and who will believe you about freedom?

515
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,399
Is that the way to understand it?

516
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,199
That's not the idea of it in the Orthodox Church.

517
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:12,720
That's Rome.

518
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:17,360
So now it turns out the Grand Inquisitor is Rome, of course.

519
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:26,240
And Alyasha is saying, yeah, but you're giving a story which isn't the Protestant story or the Grand Inquisitor story.

520
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,639
I mean, you are.

521
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:32,879
You're giving those other views, but you're not giving the Russian Orthodox view.

522
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:38,239
At least that's, I tell you, Dostoevsky always leaves one hint, and that's the one.

523
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:40,320
I don't know how I didn't read it.

524
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,519
But now let's go back.

525
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,159
Where are we?

526
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:49,439
I'm trying to lay out this antinomy about the people who are too weak to live on nothing.

527
00:52:49,759 --> 00:52:53,679
So here's the bottom of 249.

528
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:56,320
I may have read it already, but I'll read it again.

529
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:02,559
The people who born they crossed, endured for years in the bare and hungry wilderness, living on locusts and roots.

530
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:08,159
Thou mayest indeed point with pride at those children of freedom, of free love, free and splendid sacrifice for thy name.

531
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:10,799
But remember, there are only 1,000, and what are the rest?

532
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,040
I read it, but that's the important thing.

533
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:17,679
You can't have a cuck.

534
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:24,839
You can't build a world around the aesthetics in order to combine freedom and food.

535
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,040
Most people aren't capable of being ascetics.

536
00:53:28,359 --> 00:53:43,400
The interesting test would be, and we should come back to that, bear that in mind, whether Zostama and Alyasha are ascetics and sort of live on the minimal amount of food to live on.

537
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:44,839
We'll see about that.

538
00:53:44,839 --> 00:53:47,239
But in the meantime, let's keep our eye on this.

539
00:53:47,239 --> 00:53:49,320
The majority are too weak.

540
00:53:49,319 --> 00:53:55,159
So the Grand Inquisitor's argument is that if everyone lived on roots and mushrooms, there would be enough food to go around.

541
00:53:55,159 --> 00:54:01,480
But in a world in which weak and self-indulgent people eat all they can, there's going to be scarcity.

542
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:09,720
And you won't be able to feed all the people unless you have this organized, completely state-controlled economy.

543
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:12,839
No science will give them bread as long as they're free.

544
00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:13,799
I read that, didn't I?

545
00:54:13,799 --> 00:54:15,080
If I didn't, I will.

546
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,679
On 246.

547
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,039
I did read it.

548
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,200
Okay, so we've got that.

549
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:39,719
And the church will take away their food and give it back to them, in effect, from each according to their ability, to each according to their need.

550
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,199
That's what Marx said.

551
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,720
It will be state socialism.

552
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:58,600
On 251, at the bottom of the last paragraph, whole paragraph, receiving bread from us, they will see clearly that we take the bread made by their hands from them to give it to them.

553
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:04,920
Presumably from each according, but from each according to his ability, to each according to his need.

554
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,079
But you can't let that just happen.

555
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:11,000
You've got to plan your whole economy if you're going to do that.

556
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:25,280
And then you have to make people take the jobs that are needed to be taken, and you have to test people and make them take the jobs that their aptitude fits and send them to the part of the country where whatever needs to be produced and takes away their freedom.

557
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:35,520
So, okay, now, interestingly enough, I think I'm going to do this in a different way than I planned.

558
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:42,400
I think we should answer each of these one at a time instead of answering them all at the end.

559
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,879
So, I'm going to jump to the third.

560
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:55,120
You want to know right away, if you're following this, what's the answer to the bread question?

561
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,760
Okay, I'm going to jump to the answer to the bread question.

562
00:55:57,759 --> 00:56:00,959
Do people need material satisfaction in order to be moral?

563
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,040
That's one of the questions left over.

564
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,520
How much material satisfaction do they need?

565
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:10,400
On one side of the antinome is the extreme ascetic view attributed to Jesus.

566
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,639
You don't need any food to be moral.

567
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:19,760
And is there anyone in the book who is a holy ascetic like Jesus demands?

568
00:56:19,759 --> 00:56:21,999
Now, who is the one who brought this up?

569
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:23,360
You.

570
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:36,559
Yes, there is a holy ascetic of just exactly the course, just exactly the kind of person that the Grand Inquisitor says Jesus says is what everybody should be.

571
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,520
And who is that?

572
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,799
Well, he already told us.

573
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:40,480
Father Farrapon.

574
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,999
Now, Father Farrapon is an interesting character.

575
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,280
He lives on the border of the monastery.

576
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:50,720
He's an enemy of Zosima.

577
00:56:50,719 --> 00:57:07,240
And he is a prideful guy who is an extreme ascetic and does live just the way the Grand Inquisitor lived once in the forest on mushrooms and berries.

578
00:57:07,239 --> 00:57:10,840
On 168, we hear about him.

579
00:57:14,679 --> 00:57:25,880
So he says on 168, about three-quarters of the line down, yes, I can give up their bread, not needing it at all, go into the forest and live there on mushrooms and berries.

580
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,719
But they can't give up their bread here.

581
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:29,319
They are in bondage to the devil.

582
00:57:29,319 --> 00:57:33,079
Nowadays, the unclean deny that there's need for such fasting.

583
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:36,360
Haughty and unclean is their judgment.

584
00:57:36,359 --> 00:57:38,839
And what about Father Farpon?

585
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:45,240
Does he illustrate that, he illustrates that people can do this, live in this way?

586
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,159
We just see that.

587
00:57:47,159 --> 00:57:48,920
And I think.

588
00:58:01,719 --> 00:58:04,439
Okay, yeah, but what about him?

589
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,840
Is he somebody we're supposed to admire?

590
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:09,480
Is he a model like Zosima?

591
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,120
No, he's completely crazy.

592
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:17,800
He's a prideful, spiteful, jealous, and that's bad enough.

593
00:58:17,799 --> 00:58:20,840
But I mean, besides that, he's totally insane.

594
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:29,560
On 168 at the bottom, he's telling us that he saw a devil sitting on a man's chest.

595
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:36,439
And then he tells us on 169, I tell you, I can see, I can see right through them.

596
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:41,999
When I was coming out from the superiors, I saw one, that's a devil, hiding from me behind the door.

597
00:58:41,799 --> 00:58:45,999
He was a big one, a yard and a half or more high with a thick, long gray tail.

598
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:51,199
And the tip of his tail was in the crack of the door, and I was quick and slammed the door, pinching his tail in it.

599
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:57,600
He squealed and began to struggle, and I made the sign of the cross over him three times, and he died on the spot like a crushed spider.

600
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,199
He must have rotted there in the corner.

601
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:00,480
He must be stinking.

602
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,519
But they don't see it.

603
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,559
They don't smell.

604
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,719
That is the other monks.

605
00:59:04,719 --> 00:59:07,679
They don't see these devils all over the place.

606
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:16,400
Well, are we supposed to think that he's a good guy and he sees the devils all over the place and the other ones are all just too self-indulgent and eat too much food and miss them?

607
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:29,439
No, no, we're supposed to think this is the kind of ascetic that we don't need and that this is not the way, you don't have to, this is not the way to be a good, moral, joyful, loving person.

608
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:34,959
There's nothing good and loving about Father Farrakhan, that he's just bad.

609
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:41,039
So it looks like the whole asceticism proposal isn't good.

610
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,720
That's half the story.

611
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:49,760
Now the other half is: is there any evidence in the book that people need more than the minimal amount of food?

612
00:59:49,759 --> 00:59:55,679
More even than bread, let alone more than the worms and berries and mushrooms.

613
00:59:55,679 --> 01:00:02,320
Yes, there is evidence like that, nice fun evidence, which I will get to right now.

614
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:17,999
So, first there's the story there is that Zosima is worried about the priests who need food in order to fight off the Lutherans.

615
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,600
Unfortunately, I do believe I didn't want it.

616
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,919
I doubt if anybody can just turn to it.

617
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,600
That would be too much.

618
01:00:27,159 --> 01:00:28,600
Maybe I can.

619
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,360
I don't even think I can do that.

620
01:00:30,359 --> 01:00:31,880
But let me try.

621
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:36,600
It's in the Russian monk, starting in 173.

622
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:43,399
Somewhere he tells us about what happens to, here they are, or 282 it is.

623
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,159
I have to write it down.

624
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,360
Okay, look at this now.

625
01:00:53,639 --> 01:00:55,959
Here we are in the middle of page 282.

626
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:56,999
Two interesting things.

627
01:00:57,239 --> 01:01:05,159
You get to see the Lutherans again prowling around, and you get to see that the priests can't do good if they don't have enough to eat.

628
01:01:05,159 --> 01:01:16,519
Friends and teachers, I've heard more than once, and of late one may hear it more often, that the priests and above all the village priests are complaining that their miserable income and their miserable income and humiliating lot.

629
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:27,080
They plainly state, even in print and so forth, that if Lutherans and heretics come and lead the flock astray, they let them because they have so little to live on.

630
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:33,319
May the Lord increase that sustenance that is so precious to them, for their complaint is just.

631
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:39,239
But of a truth, I say, if anyone is to blame in the matter, half the fault is ours.

632
01:01:39,239 --> 01:01:42,120
Well, that's typical of Zosima, always blaming himself.

633
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:57,320
But the important thing I want to get out of this is it's clear that Zosima, whom you can always trust, remember I read you the letter early on in this lecture, that Dostoevsky says in the confessions of Zosima, he's answering the Grand Inquisitor story, but indirectly.

634
01:01:57,319 --> 01:01:59,159
Well, here's one answer.

635
01:01:59,159 --> 01:02:07,720
Zossima is saying, you've got to be feeding people, and you can't expect them to live on minimal stuff and go out and do good deeds and fight off the Lutherans.

636
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:18,399
But that's, and maybe you think, though, if you're reading it, and you might well, well, that's true, but at least they shouldn't be sort of engaged in any frivolous kind of liking of things.

637
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:22,560
Let's give them the basic material stuff to be moral.

638
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:30,800
But surely they're not supposed to be indulging in banana splits and hot fudge Sundays and chocolate molded milkshakes and stuff.

639
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:31,919
But in fact, they are.

640
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:32,959
Only they don't have them.

641
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:38,559
But what do they have that they seem to crave like hot fudge Sundays?

642
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:41,600
No?

643
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,039
Cherry jam.

644
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:44,400
Remember that?

645
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,920
It turns up twice on 321.

646
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,159
Well, it starts when you lay back.

647
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:57,520
We might as well get the first cherry jam, which is on 329.

648
01:02:57,839 --> 01:02:59,280
229.

649
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:00,639
229.

650
01:03:00,639 --> 01:03:01,279
Remember?

651
01:03:01,279 --> 01:03:09,759
When they're together, when Yvonne is 229.

652
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:12,000
What am I doing?

653
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:14,320
Just to say.

654
01:03:18,159 --> 01:03:20,800
Maybe 221 or 222.

655
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,880
Yeah, 222.

656
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:28,319
When the brothers are together, after the second paragraph, let me have soup and tea afterwards.

657
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:29,679
I'm hungry, said Alyasha.

658
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:31,040
Alyasha is always hungry.

659
01:03:31,199 --> 01:03:35,040
Takes a lot of energy to go around and doing good deeds all the time like he does.

660
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:39,280
He's often going down the street eating a roll, and here he is hungry again.

661
01:03:39,279 --> 01:03:42,879
And he goes, and Yvonne says, and cherry jam, they have it here.

662
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,520
You remember how you used to love cherry jam when you were little?

663
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:46,239
You remember that?

664
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:47,600
Let me have jam too.

665
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:48,880
I still like it.

666
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:52,400
And so that's the sort of hot fudge Sunday part.

667
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:59,719
But you get it again on 229, I believe.

668
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,439
No, right.

669
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:08,199
Did I read 222?

670
01:04:08,199 --> 01:04:09,320
I'm getting lost.

671
01:04:09,319 --> 01:04:09,799
No.

672
01:04:09,799 --> 01:04:11,399
So what's on 220?

673
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,679
Okay, no, I see.

674
01:04:16,679 --> 01:04:19,799
No, it's what we want: Zosima.

675
01:04:20,199 --> 01:04:22,120
So that must be 321.

676
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,440
There are just too many references here.

677
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,639
Yeah, a middle of 321.

678
01:04:27,639 --> 01:04:30,519
This is what people are complaining about with Zosima.

679
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:35,960
He was not strict in fasting, allowed himself sweet things, ate cherry jam with his tea.

680
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:39,000
Ladies used to send it to him, and so forth.

681
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:57,799
Well, if Zosima and Alyasha need and need food in order to do good deeds, and even need goodies like cherry jam, or not if they don't need them, but want them and get them, it's clear that, according to Dostoevsky, the Russian Orthodox Church is not into asceticism.

682
01:04:57,799 --> 01:05:01,560
Now, whether that's really true of the Russian Orthodox Church, I have no idea.

683
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:08,440
But Dostoevsky thinks it's fine to be able to eat things you like.

684
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:26,520
And it's only when it becomes something that keeps you from ever, that begins to keep you from being free by making you addicted to something like cherry jam, if you could imagine, then it becomes a bad thing.

685
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:47,519
So Zosima says on 303.

686
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,320
You've got to find this interesting middle ground.

687
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:58,880
Total asceticism that Dostoevsky thinks is wrong and thinks the Orthodox Church thinks it's wrong.

688
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:07,599
Total self-indulgence, where you eat as many good things as you can and try to learn appetites for new weird things you didn't even know you liked and so forth.

689
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:10,319
Sort of Berkeley approach is wrong too.

690
01:06:10,719 --> 01:06:16,560
The bottom of 303, the world has proclaimed the reign of freedom, especially of late.

691
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,080
Nothing and so forth and so forth.

692
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:22,560
You have desires and so satisfy them, for you have the same rights as the most rich and powerful.

693
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:25,919
Don't be afraid of satisfying them and even multiplying your desires.

694
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,159
That's the modern doctrine of the world.

695
01:06:28,159 --> 01:06:30,000
In that they see freedom.

696
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,200
And Zosima thinks that that is where they lose their freedom.

697
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:39,520
He goes on and explains it on the next page.

698
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:49,279
In answer to the modern view, he says at the end of the second paragraph, for how can a man shake off his habits?

699
01:06:49,279 --> 01:06:55,759
What can become of him if he is in such bondage to the habit of satisfying the innumerable desires he's created for himself?

700
01:06:55,759 --> 01:07:03,440
He is isolated in what concerns him and what concerns have he for the rest of humanity.

701
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:09,440
Men have succeeded in accumulating great masses of objects, but the joy in the world has grown less.

702
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:16,399
And so there is a place for a certain amount of not self-indulgence.

703
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:19,599
And he goes on, this is the Russian Orthodox view, presumably.

704
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:21,120
The monastic way is different.

705
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:25,599
Obedience, fasting, and prayer are laughed at by the modern.

706
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:28,599
Yet only through them lies the way to real true freedom.

707
01:07:28,599 --> 01:07:32,120
I cut off my superfluous, unnecessary desires.

708
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:32,679
Interesting.

709
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,920
I don't know what to say about cherry jam.

710
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:42,919
He's obviously seems to be, that does seem to be a superfluous, unnecessary desire, but he's not inclined to cut it off.

711
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:45,080
I guess he means just be moderate.

712
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:51,639
I mean, don't, you, don't have, don't cultivate as many superfluous desires as you can.

713
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:57,879
Find all kinds of interesting things that you didn't even know existed that you really liked, want more of.

714
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:03,159
But on the other hand, it's okay to enjoy a few things, and he does.

715
01:08:07,559 --> 01:08:16,679
He says, I subdue my proud and wanton will and chastise it with obedience, and with God's help, I attain freedom of spirit and with it, spiritual joy.

716
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:26,439
Which is most capable of conceiving a great idea and serving it, the rich man in his isolation, or the man who has freed himself from the tyranny of material things.

717
01:08:27,559 --> 01:08:35,479
Okay, so on the one hand, the Grand Inquisitor sort of lets people have the tyranny of material things and habits.

718
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:43,239
And the Jesus figure says, no, don't eat anything but the absolute minimum to stay alive.

719
01:08:43,239 --> 01:08:58,599
And Zosima says, eat as much and enjoy as much as you need to have the energy to do moral things, and even eat something more that you enjoy, as long as it doesn't enslave you and keep you from enjoying things and being free to do what you want.

720
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:06,279
As long as I think he thinks my hunch is, as long as he could say no to cherry jam, if he wanted to, then it's okay.

721
01:09:06,279 --> 01:09:11,679
But if he's addicted to cherry jam, then he's lost his freedom, and that's not okay.

722
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,759
So that's the story.

723
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,599
So he's got the middle ground.

724
01:09:15,599 --> 01:09:18,000
I think I just read the necessary quotes.

725
01:09:11,239 --> 01:09:18,159
Yeah.

726
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:24,879
And now, what does he think we should do as far as planned economy is concerned?

727
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:32,799
Granted, now that we've got people not eating all they can, but not eating the absolute minimum either, but something in between.

728
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:36,239
I tell you, this is sort of boring and not very original.

729
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:39,120
And I'm sorry about that, but it's sensible.

730
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:45,439
But anyway, he's got an interesting proposal about how should you organize the state, the economy?

731
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:47,679
How should you organize the economy?

732
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:58,000
Well, he thinks that what you should do is not have one big state economy, but lots of local commune-like economy.

733
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:15,359
This went over well in the 70s when people were going up to Oregon and Washington and setting up hippie communes in which they would all know each other and love each other and make the food and share the food and the clothes and stuff.

734
01:10:15,599 --> 01:10:19,439
The Amish were the kind of heroes of this or the model of this.

735
01:10:19,439 --> 01:10:23,439
And I think he, Dostoevsky, is proposing something like that.

736
01:10:23,439 --> 01:10:31,679
He thinks that it would be great to have local communities and you wouldn't have to sort of forcibly redistribute the goods.

737
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:37,359
Each would actually give according to his ability to each according to his need.

738
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:43,199
And you can see this on 281.

739
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:45,439
But he's proposing it.

740
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:48,479
No?

741
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:49,519
Not 281.

742
01:10:49,519 --> 01:10:53,799
I'm having a hard time keeping track of my plans today.

743
01:10:53,519 --> 01:10:56,359
283.

744
01:10:54,479 --> 01:10:58,199
Yes, the bottom of 283.

745
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:07,799
It goes back to the Lutherans and prowling around and the poor priests who are too hungry to be able to fight them off.

746
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:11,239
On the bottom of the next page, you get...

747
01:11:12,599 --> 01:11:14,199
What should these priests do?

748
01:11:14,199 --> 01:11:16,519
Just eat less?

749
01:11:16,519 --> 01:11:18,040
He says, that won't work.

750
01:11:18,359 --> 01:11:21,000
Just go out and spend all their time growing things to eat.

751
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:27,879
Well, then they can't go and help the people, their parishioners, the people they're supposed to take care of.

752
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:29,559
So here's what he says.

753
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:40,839
You tell them simple tales, you penetrate their hearts, give one hour a week to it in spite of your poverty, only one short hour.

754
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:47,960
And you will see for yourself that our people are generous, gracious, and grateful, and will repay you a hundredfold.

755
01:11:47,960 --> 01:12:01,559
Mindful of the kindness of their priest and the moving words they've heard from him, they will, of their own accord, freely help him in his fields and in his house, and will treat him with more respect than before, so that it will even increase his worldly well-being.

756
01:12:01,559 --> 01:12:09,800
So if you do good deeds to people, they will help you, and everybody will be happier, and everybody will have enough to eat, and so forth.

757
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:18,359
If you get into these communes where you are actually personally involved with all the people who you depend on and who depend on you.

758
01:12:18,359 --> 01:12:20,679
That's his proposal.

759
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:24,759
Now the next question is, just in time to finish this proposal.

760
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,679
So, and what do you think?

761
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:29,159
Is this a plausible view?

762
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,120
What's happened to the...

763
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:34,599
The Amish are still going on, which is impressive.

764
01:12:34,599 --> 01:12:37,159
I don't know of any hippie communes that are still going on.

765
01:12:37,159 --> 01:12:38,120
Do you?

766
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:39,479
Huh?

767
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:40,359
I don't know.

768
01:12:41,159 --> 01:12:41,559
What?

769
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:50,800
I see, I see.

770
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:56,159
Yes, yes, well, that's the nearest thing, but it isn't a full-time job.

771
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:57,279
I see what you mean.

772
01:12:57,279 --> 01:13:12,800
And I was wondering, last time I was teaching this, the big sort of discussion broke out over whether in Israel the idea of the kibbutz is still an important part, or whether people have discovered you can't be selfish, self-less like that, and be property-less like that.

773
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,159
Anybody know?

774
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:14,880
Nobody knew?

775
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,159
Yeah, you've got something to say about that.

776
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:17,359
Go ahead.

777
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:18,559
What?

778
01:13:19,519 --> 01:13:21,199
Still very popular.

779
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:24,000
And they share everything, right?

780
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,080
No personal possessions.

781
01:13:26,399 --> 01:13:27,919
Something like that.

782
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:32,239
Okay, well, it works to some extent then.

783
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:33,920
It didn't seem to work here.

784
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:34,479
Yeah?

785
01:13:35,439 --> 01:13:36,800
A lot of people know this.

786
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:40,960
In the kibbutz.

787
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:42,639
Yeah, that's what I would suggest.

788
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,080
That's what I have heard.

789
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:59,519
I think that's why I was sort of emphasizing this totally selfless sharing of everything with everybody, which Dostoevsky's got as the Guzasima proposal, doesn't seem to work.

790
01:13:59,519 --> 01:14:06,639
Now, and that turns out to be, and this is the last thing I want to say, very interesting and surprising.

791
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,519
Suppose you say to Dostoevsky, well, it doesn't work.

792
01:14:09,519 --> 01:14:15,040
People are, if not selfish and lazy, at least they want some possessions of their own.

793
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:21,839
They're not able to just share, giving everybody what they need, and so forth.

794
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:25,279
Would Dostoevsky say, uh-oh, I guess I got it wrong.

795
01:14:25,279 --> 01:14:28,919
Human nature isn't as nice as I thought it was.

796
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:30,919
Or what?

797
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:34,120
Well, I think this is one of the places where Zosima's got it wrong.

798
01:14:34,439 --> 01:14:38,359
And where Zosima knows, where Dostoevsky knows that Zossima's got it wrong.

799
01:14:38,439 --> 01:14:48,120
He's too protected in the monks in the monastery do presumably live this way without private possessions, I presumably without money.

800
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:52,279
But people normally can't live this way.

801
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:54,919
And we see this on 293.

802
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:03,719
Now, what I want to say is, this is something part of a bigger picture, which I can't give it all to you yet.

803
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:10,439
But Dostoevsky is going to say human beings are nasty and brutish.

804
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:15,799
As Hobbes said, a famous philosopher, human life is nasty, brutish, and short.

805
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:23,879
That is, and Dostoevsky totally believes that people are intrinsically selfish.

806
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:27,319
And that's why the hippie communes wouldn't work.

807
01:15:27,479 --> 01:15:29,639
That's why people have possessions.

808
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:30,599
I don't know what they aim.

809
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:36,279
I bet they have possessions and money, but they have also a kind of lot of shared activities.

810
01:15:36,279 --> 01:15:37,080
I don't know.

811
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:41,960
But anyway, here's what Dostoevsky thinks, the bottom of 293, about 10 lines from the bottom.

812
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:44,439
Everyone strives to keep his individuality.

813
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:48,439
Everyone wants to secure the greatest possible fullness of life for himself.

814
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:54,839
But meantime, all his efforts result not in attaining fullness of life, but self-destruction.

815
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:59,000
For instead of self-realization, he ends by arriving at complete solitude.

816
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,960
All mankind in our age is split up into units.

817
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:04,359
Man keeps apart, each in his own groove.

818
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:07,399
Each one holds aloof, hides himself, and so forth.

819
01:16:07,399 --> 01:16:11,479
He ends up being repelled by others and repelling them.

820
01:16:11,479 --> 01:16:13,359
He heaps up riches for himself.

821
01:16:13,359 --> 01:16:15,439
This is Hobbes' picture exactly.

822
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:19,040
And thinks, how strong I am now and how secure.

823
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:26,719
And in his madness, those are sort of built-up-gated communities in which you keep your money and your property and keep all the other people out.

824
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:32,960
And in his madness, he does not understand that the more he heaps up, the more he sinks into self-destructive impotence.

825
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,439
Well, that's interesting.

826
01:16:35,439 --> 01:16:49,279
How is he going to, I'm not going to try to answer this yet, but how Dostoevsky's got the view that people are sinful, selfish, and so forth, and want private property and lots of it.

827
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:59,279
How is he going to defend a kind of view in which there ought to be communities in which people love and help each other?

828
01:16:59,279 --> 01:17:02,880
Well, he's got a view about that, a very interesting view about it.

829
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:06,799
But we can't do that part yet.

830
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,960
So we stop with that for the moment.

831
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:17,359
And next time we do the interesting ones, the ones about church and the ones about miracles, because there he has really original ideas.
