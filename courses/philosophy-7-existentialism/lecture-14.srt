1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,319
Alyasha is the son of the religious, crazy, saint-like mother.

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:25,800
And her kind of intense religion produces two kids, and we're doing now their genetic background, so to speak, with their same, with this extreme religious temperament that she has.

3
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:41,079
And we talked already about how Yvonne is trying to rid himself of all impurities, of what he calls the lackey side of himself, and that, and he's trying to just clean himself of that.

4
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:49,720
And now we're going to talk about Alyasha, who is trying to pure himself by accepting and transforming his sensual impulses.

5
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:52,439
So he doesn't know that's what he's doing yet.

6
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:55,320
That's what Zasima tells Mrs.

7
00:00:55,319 --> 00:00:56,999
Holocaust she has to do.

8
00:00:56,999 --> 00:01:08,120
And it's clear that that's what anybody has to do who's trying to get together their whole self and not make their life work by getting rid of half of their self.

9
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:13,159
I'm looking for my copy of the chart.

10
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:22,199
I'm looking at the self in the brothers chart as I talk because I'm looking to see how the factors get characterized.

11
00:01:22,199 --> 00:01:23,719
Well, interesting.

12
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,520
I guess Alyasha hasn't got names for the factors.

13
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:30,360
I never noticed that before.

14
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,960
We know that base and noble are Yvonne, and we know Insect and Angel for Dimitri.

15
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,800
We've talked about them.

16
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,120
But keep your eyes open.

17
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,079
Let me know.

18
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:45,800
I'll try to remember to keep my eyes open whether Alyasha has a name for the two sides.

19
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,439
I have a feeling he doesn't, or I would have picked them up by now.

20
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,120
But he certainly has the two sides.

21
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,719
There's no question about that.

22
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,200
So he's struggling to put the two of them together.

23
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,800
There's no question about that.

24
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,079
On page 30, we hear about all that.

25
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,719
And now I'll try to give you sections.

26
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:09,279
This is the third son, Alyasha, sort of about in the middle of that chapter.

27
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,199
And so we're going to know toward the beginning of the chapter.

28
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:20,079
He has a lot of problems with the sensual side of him.

29
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:23,680
And it's talked about a lot on page 30.

30
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,680
So I'm going to read you things.

31
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:48,240
Seeing that Alyama at the top paragraph in this book, seeing that Alyasha Karamatsov put his fingers in his ears whenever they talked of that, his schoolfellows sometimes crowded around him, pulled his hands away, and shouted nastiness in both ears while he struggled, slipped to the floor, tried to hide himself without uttering one word of abuse, enduring their insults in silence.

32
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,319
But at last they gave up doing this.

33
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,279
They left him alone and gave up teasing him about being a regular girl.

34
00:02:55,279 --> 00:03:00,879
And what's more, they began to look upon his modesty with compassion as a weakness.

35
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,759
He was always one of the best in the class, but never first.

36
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:11,200
I don't know why that's important, you'd ask you, but all sort of little details are always important just to give there a similitude.

37
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:19,600
He was a big fan of Dickens because Dickens had so many sort of facts in his books, just because that makes it look more real.

38
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:29,680
But what's important in that paragraph is that he can't stand any of those dirty words that even talk about the sensual side.

39
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:37,720
But, and then I've never noticed this before either, that we're going to learn in a minute that he was convinced that nothing bad could ever happen to him.

40
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:52,279
And it turns out that even in this case, they stopped doing this because he, this kind of passive resistance, he didn't struggle, he didn't insult them, he didn't do anything but just sort of fall to the floor.

41
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:57,400
After a while they gave up on that and they liked him, they gave up teasing him and liked him.

42
00:03:57,399 --> 00:04:04,040
I mean whatever bad thing might happen to Alyasha, he always manages somehow to turn it into something which is okay.

43
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:10,439
Here they look with compassion on, or they look with, what is it?

44
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:16,279
Yeah, they look with compassion on this kind of modesty instead of teasing him.

45
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:19,079
And on this page there's more.

46
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:34,680
And remember I said last time in connection with Alyasha contrasting with Yvonne that they both lived off relatives and Yvonne therefore wanted to be self-sufficient because he was so embarrassed at having lived off relatives.

47
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:42,999
And I said Alyasha never cared who he was living off of, but I don't think I read this paragraph on the middle of 32 which says that.

48
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:47,719
On what and remember I said I don't know who feeds him, I don't know who clothes him, I don't know where he lives.

49
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,800
I think that's probably true.

50
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:53,800
Dostescu on purpose doesn't tell you because it doesn't matter.

51
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:01,559
On what terms he lived with them, that is, these people, I guess.

52
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,680
Yes, the people who are taking care of him.

53
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,840
He did not know himself.

54
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,999
It was very characteristic of him that he never cared at whose expense he was living.

55
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:24,719
In that respect, he was in striking contrast to his brother Yvonne, who struggled with poverty for his first two years in the university, supported himself, and had from childhood been bitterly conscious of living at the expense of his benefactor.

56
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,599
And below that about Alyasha, he scarcely seemed to know the value of money, and he never asked for any.

57
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,079
And when anybody gave it to him, he kept it and didn't know what to do with it.

58
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,480
And then somebody sums him up.

59
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:47,680
All of this, he should remind you of the guy in the fear and trembling who is going home, who has no money.

60
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:59,199
The other night of faith we hear about, which is sort of confusing in Fear and Trembling because we don't hear about his unconditional commitment, although he presumably had one or has one or will have one.

61
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,480
But we do hear about his belief that all things are possible and that everything will be all right.

62
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:12,639
He's going home thinking of this great stew he's going to have, but he really knows realistically that he's so poor all he's going to get is turnips.

63
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,280
And when he gets home and doesn't get the stew and gets turnips, that doesn't bother him a bit.

64
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,280
Alyasha is like that.

65
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:39,600
He's at the bottom, what Muazov, who's a kind of enlightenment character who has a kind of sensible, rational view of what's going on, he says, here is perhaps the one man in the world who you might leave alone without a penny in the center of an unknown town of a million inhabitants and he would not come to harm.

66
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,320
He would not die of cold and hunger, that he would be fed and sheltered at once.

67
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,680
And if he were not, he would find a shelter for himself, and it would cost him no effort or humiliation.

68
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:51,680
And to shelter him would be no burden.

69
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:54,480
On the contrary, it would probably be looked on as a pleasure.

70
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,280
You get the picture.

71
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:02,559
He is in a total, he is self-sufficient in a completely opposite way than Yvonne.

72
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,560
He's self-sufficient because he doesn't make any effort to support himself.

73
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:11,480
He doesn't have any sense that there's any need to support himself.

74
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,120
He just goes along with the conviction that all things are possible and everything will be all right.

75
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:24,280
And the conviction alone makes him such a sort of positive, stunning character that everything always does turn out all right.

76
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:29,400
That's a nice way of for Dostoevsky to look at it.

77
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:48,440
But he doesn't, even though he survives in the world, he doesn't really want to be in the world because the world is full of people like his schoolmates who have all these nasty thoughts and nasty words that reminds him of things that he doesn't want to think about.

78
00:07:48,440 --> 00:08:07,560
So for that, the middle of 37, second page of elders, he entered upon this path, that is, going into the monastery, only because at that time it struck his imagination and seemed to him to offer an ideal means of escape for his soul from darkness to light.

79
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,039
Hmm, you dealt with that darkness and light.

80
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:10,759
What do you know?

81
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,760
That's one way to describe it, anyway.

82
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:18,999
I mean, I've been calling one of these sides of the factors the dark side to myself.

83
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:20,440
Maybe I've even said it.

84
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:28,120
So Alyasha has darkness and light at this stage.

85
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,400
Obviously, there's something wrong with thinking about things that way.

86
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:33,080
And we'll come back to that.

87
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:44,920
But it's all because it leads to the wrong idea of the factors, namely that one of them is good and one of them is bad, and what you should go, you should get out of the darkness and into the light.

88
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:49,360
That's like getting out of the world into the platonic heaven.

89
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,080
That's like getting out away from the earth and into the heaven.

90
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,560
Whatever it is, it leads off the earthly side as bad.

91
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,879
But that's how he looked at things at that point.

92
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:07,200
So he goes in the monastery because of the darkness and because he thinks it's light there.

93
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,800
And that's the rest of the story on him.

94
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:22,080
We would just come we can compare it to Yvonne, who on 32, where we see, I think I've already compared it to Yvonne on 30.

95
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,600
Yeah, come on, wait a minute, let me just, I just read you something about Yvonne, right?

96
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,759
Where it says, unlike his elder brother Yvonne.

97
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,920
And we'll compare him to Dmitri then on 113.

98
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,480
Okay, 113 is Confessions of a Passionate Heart in Anecdote.

99
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,640
That's chapter 4 or something.

100
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,560
There's so many books and divisions, I can't go back and look to see what they are.

101
00:09:52,560 --> 00:10:02,640
But anyway, in that confession, we hear about Dimitri, and we hear about something really weird about Alyosha at the same time.

102
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:18,400
So Dimitri's going on, as usual, right after his insects and sensual lust, to confessing that he's got this insect side, which he doesn't want to have, but which he certainly can't get rid of.

103
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,960
And he says about a third of the way down, I love cruelty.

104
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,999
Am I not a bug?

105
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,920
Am I not a poisonous insect?

106
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,160
In fact, I'm a Karamatsov.

107
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:30,720
Let me say a word about that at some point.

108
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,920
It looks like Karamatsov is the name for the dark side of the factors.

109
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:38,920
And this comes up a lot.

110
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:44,120
Ivan calls himself, calls his bad side Karamatsov.

111
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,800
You'll see in a minute that Alyasha's bad side is called Karamatsov, and here's Dmitri.

112
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:54,999
It's very important, but I didn't put it on the chart for reasons I can't explain yet.

113
00:10:54,999 --> 00:10:58,999
And I won't be able to explain until literally the last sentence of the book.

114
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:03,159
But in the meantime, you can put Karamatsov in in pencil.

115
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:06,840
That means you may need to erase it at some point.

116
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:14,600
But at this point, certainly Karamatsov is being used by everybody as a name for the dark side.

117
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,640
And he goes on about two-thirds of the way down.

118
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:27,080
Though I'm full of baseness and love what's low, and here this is typical Dmitri, when he's just said that he's an insect and he's a Karamatsov and so forth, what do you expect?

119
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,560
Well, he's just said the sodom and insect side.

120
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:43,800
What do you want to hear from Ivan, from Dmitry, is always, of course, I'm also an angel, and of course, I'm also an honorable person, because he's always got the sodom and the Madonna side, the insect and the angel.

121
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:49,240
So he goes on, though I'm full of baseness and love what's low, I'm not dishonorable.

122
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,360
You're blushing, enough of this filth with you or for you, he means there.

123
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:10,600
Now, because Yvonne goes into a bunch of details about how he seduced this girl and then didn't pay any attention to her for five months and so forth, and he's confessing how bad he feels about it, but that he's the gentleman anyway, because he didn't tell anybody about it, and so forth.

124
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,200
And this is naturally upsetting Alyasha.

125
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,160
And so he's, and what Alyasha's response is very interesting.

126
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:20,160
I'm still in 113.

127
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:24,400
You say that he says, I'm going to change the subject.

128
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:39,760
And he says, don't be surprised that I'm glad to tell you, instead of being ashamed, I mean, this is just more of Dimitri's complete lip-bopping between the two sides.

129
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:41,760
And then it gets interesting.

130
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:49,360
You say that because I blushed, Alyasha said suddenly, I wasn't blushing at what you were saying or at what you've done.

131
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,520
I blushed because I'm the same as you.

132
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,360
That's very important.

133
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,319
That's the first evidence we've had, I guess.

134
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:10,400
I don't have to go back and look and see if it's the first, but it's certainly evidence that Alyasha's got the same side, the insect, Sodom, base, dark, sensual, Karamatsov side, as Dimitri.

135
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,919
And he knows it.

136
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,760
And Dimitri says, you, that's going a little too far.

137
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:17,919
No, it's true, insists Alyasha.

138
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,840
Obviously, the idea was not a new one.

139
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,280
The ladder's the same.

140
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,840
I'm on the bottom step, and you're above, somewhere about the 13th.

141
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,520
That's how I see it.

142
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,759
Well, that's pretty weird, isn't it?

143
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:35,360
Because you'd expect that he's going to say, well, we're the same, all right.

144
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:42,399
You're down at the bottom someplace, and I'm 13 steps above you, that I'm going to, but I'm going to, period.

145
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,440
I mean, he's not certainly wallowing and doing these bad things that Dimitri's doing.

146
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,999
This is a very peculiar Christian thing that the Dostoevsky just sort of throws off.

147
00:13:54,799 --> 00:14:01,040
What Alyasha is saying is that you're ahead of me because you're worse than me.

148
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:09,240
I'm only beginning, that you're really wallowing in this sensual despair.

149
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:19,320
And what's happening is the Christian view, which you get in Kierkegaard, that you've got to go into despair before you can be saved.

150
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,800
The very idea, we're so used to hearing it that it doesn't, it just sounds like noise in our ears.

151
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:26,120
That this is a Christian idea to be saved.

152
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,800
Buddhists aren't saved.

153
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:35,240
You've got to be saved because you've got to realize that on your own, you can't have a life that works.

154
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:40,760
And you realize that by trying and getting deeper and deeper into despair.

155
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:46,040
And Ivan is ahead of Alyasha in despair.

156
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,200
That's what it means, I think.

157
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:51,560
So he says, let's read it again.

158
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,519
I'm the same as you.

159
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,639
The ladder's the same.

160
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:56,999
I'm at the bottom step.

161
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:59,960
And you're above somewhere about the 13th.

162
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:05,720
Meaning that the ladder that goes, I don't know how to put it.

163
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,999
I'm suddenly puzzled myself now.

164
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:11,240
Alyasha's.

165
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:15,879
I mean, Alyasha is just beginning the despair.

166
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:21,239
And Demetri is higher than him because he's lower than him.

167
00:15:21,239 --> 00:15:23,800
Because he's further down in the despair.

168
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,399
That's what it's about.

169
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,399
You get it in all sorts of ways.

170
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:42,360
Remember in the third man, at the beginning of the movie, when the porter says he's either in heaven or in hell, and we cut to the priest who says that Jesus descended into hell for three days.

171
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,159
That's another peculiar part of Christianity.

172
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:49,840
Why did he have to go down before, why did he take a shortcut directly to heaven?

173
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:52,959
You've got to go down before you can go up.

174
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,120
In Dante, whom I refer to every once in a while, he's got to go to the bottom of the inferno on his trip to paradise.

175
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:02,479
Well, because that's the structure of this.

176
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:09,519
And Kierkegaard's got the structure, and thus he's got the same structure.

177
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:18,399
You've got to despair completely of being the kind of self that everybody is before you can come out of it.

178
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,479
And remember, as Osima tells Mrs.

179
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:26,399
Holocaust, on, I don't think I can just flip to it.

180
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:39,519
Remember, he says to her, you have to keep looking at the dark side of yourself, and if you look into it more and more, it'll turn around and you will begin to see that it's not, that you're not in despair anymore.

181
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,559
We'll see more and more of this going on, but that's a hint of it.

182
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,559
Now let's see what we are.

183
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,039
Anybody, by the way, just raise your hand, yell if you want to say anything.

184
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,759
Nobody wants to yell and say anything.

185
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,240
Okay, let's see what we are.

186
00:16:56,239 --> 00:17:00,959
On 113, did I think I just finished what I wanted to say?

187
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,320
Let's see.

188
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,439
Yes.

189
00:17:04,639 --> 00:17:08,559
Now, one more thing about Alyasha.

190
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,879
Why is he in such good state?

191
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:23,280
Well, partly, I said, because he just has faith, but he also has put hisself together more or less by having a defining commitment.

192
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:33,120
It doesn't really integrate the factors, but it certainly gives him a sense of having meaning and hope in his life.

193
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:38,439
And he's integrated the factors sort of temporarily and partially.

194
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:43,080
It's kind of tricky the way Dostoevsky is handling it on purpose.

195
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,439
But he has got a defining commitment for Zosima.

196
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:56,999
And that's making him able to go on and lead a very committed life.

197
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,239
He has something like eternity and time already, something like the infinite and the finite already.

198
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:11,399
Because you get, in those Kierkegaard factors terms, you get that if you've got an unconditional commitment, and he's got that.

199
00:18:11,879 --> 00:18:21,159
You can see that on page 30, which is probably in the Alyasha.

200
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:32,999
It's in the third son thing, a page in, where it tells us, okay, I'm going to read this further about six lines down.

201
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,920
And the reason, well, he once, well, I better read all of it from starting on the top.

202
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:40,199
He was simply a lover of humanity, which is not right.

203
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:42,279
That's the obtuse narrator coming in.

204
00:18:42,439 --> 00:18:46,680
I mean, lover of humanity is just not the correct Christian way of thinking about it.

205
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,519
He loves each particular person who's in his vicinity.

206
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,320
He's loving his neighbor, not humanity.

207
00:18:53,320 --> 00:19:06,120
He was simply a lover of humanity, and that he adopted the monastic life was because at that time it struck him as the ideal escape for his soul, struggling from the darkness of worldly wickedness to the light of love.

208
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,520
Look, it's all over darkness and light for him.

209
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,360
Well, how did I miss it all these years?

210
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:23,520
And then skipping down a little, and the reason this life struck him this way was that he found in it at that time, as he thought, an extraordinary being, our celebrated elder Zosima.

211
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,999
Now comes the commitment, to whom he became attached with all the warm first love of his ardent heart.

212
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,279
So this is his current unconditional commitment.

213
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:49,999
Now, as soon as you see that, when you're looking at it, then have read Fear and Trembling, you ask yourself, and how is he going to deal with the death of Zosima, who's old and sick, and not going to last much longer?

214
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,279
And that's a big test, of course, for him.

215
00:19:53,280 --> 00:20:04,639
Whether he's a knight of faith, whether he'll go into despair or resignation, or whether he'll interiorize it, we don't know yet, but you'll get to find out.

216
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:05,279
Yeah.

217
00:20:10,719 --> 00:20:11,760
Wow, that's good.

218
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,759
I think that that's the right question.

219
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:20,639
And the answer is supposed to be: if he hasn't been tested in that, sort of what I'm saying, he could still be in despair.

220
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:26,479
I mean, the French woman in Hiroshima has an unconditional commitment, and she's in despair.

221
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:30,800
So we don't know what he's going to do when Zasima dies.

222
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:39,999
And in that way, he's not going through the despair of trying to get himself the factors together as he has to.

223
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,080
He's sort of protected from that.

224
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,079
And that's why I said it was a kind of temporary, somewhat thing.

225
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:57,199
If it was a full unconditional commitment and he had already understood that he could lose it and seen the sword over the head of the beloved and went on as if it was the shortest thing, well, that would be different.

226
00:20:57,199 --> 00:21:05,639
Boy, when Zosima dies, and it's going to be no surprise given that he's very old, Ariasha's reaction is definitely not like that.

227
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:09,000
It's very, very interesting what happens to him.

228
00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:15,879
But they're also this I just sort of say as an aside, because I have no idea what's going to happen.

229
00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:19,239
There's three pages left out of the edition you've got.

230
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:21,080
I would never use this edition again.

231
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,600
I didn't order this edition.

232
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,199
But nothing important happens in those three pages.

233
00:21:26,199 --> 00:21:38,199
But what happens is that Dostoevsky has a little vent propos, a little word to the reader, saying that this is the first of two volumes that he is writing.

234
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:45,080
This is the youth of Alyasha, and then he's going to write a book about Alyasha when he becomes grown up.

235
00:21:45,080 --> 00:22:02,439
And I take it that not only does he have to go through the test of the death of Zosima, but he has to go through really understanding that he's got a sensual dark side and he better know, he better deal with it.

236
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:11,080
I like to think, but I suspect it's not so, that he's going to get seduced by Grushenka eventually, but maybe not.

237
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,040
She's certainly trying.

238
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,840
Where was this place?

239
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:21,239
We're coming to it, where she's saying where Rakitin says she wants to get him in bed or take off his cassock.

240
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:22,520
That's what she says.

241
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:41,959
Anyway, but I don't know what really happens to him in the second volume, except that it's got he's got to he's got to sin more, despair more, and suffer more before he becomes the s superhero or super saint or whatever it is that the that Dostoevsky wants him to be by the end of the second book.

242
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:48,399
But uh but Dostoevsky died, and he did leave some notes for the second book, but not enough that you could reconstruct it.

243
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,560
Yeah.

244
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:03,919
Maybe.

245
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,080
I haven't, I mean, that may well be so.

246
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,800
I haven't read that.

247
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,080
This is the last book he wrote, Dostoevsky.

248
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,440
And he had epilepsy.

249
00:23:13,439 --> 00:23:15,199
I didn't know his son did.

250
00:23:16,719 --> 00:23:21,600
But if it is a reaction to it, boy, is it far from showing up in the book?

251
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,080
I think that's why nobody bothers to say that.

252
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,040
I mean, maybe, and I just don't believe it.

253
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:32,320
I mean, it's clear from his notebooks that he's been working for years to get these ideas figured out.

254
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:38,159
There are more ideas per page in this book than any philosophy book that I've ever seen.

255
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:44,879
So it may, and I think he probably wrote it because, as he wrote most of his books, because he was out of money.

256
00:23:44,879 --> 00:23:51,999
He was desperately writing them, always in serial, always just getting them into the publisher in time for the next installment.

257
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,159
And if you're looking, I'll show you one place.

258
00:23:54,159 --> 00:24:04,959
You can see him leaving a cliffhanger-like in a television series where this installment's going to end and everybody's going to have to buy the next installment to see what's going to happen next.

259
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,439
We come across one of these pretty soon.

260
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,320
Okay.

261
00:24:08,639 --> 00:24:10,159
Anything else?

262
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,199
Yeah.

263
00:24:18,639 --> 00:24:20,320
Freud was interested in that.

264
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,720
Freud wrote an essay on the brothers Karamatsa.

265
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,240
And it's more complicated than that.

266
00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:49,719
Not only is Fedor the name of the father and of Dostoevsky in the book, but I think Fedor is the name of Dostoevsky's real father, who I gather from his introduction to this one, I knew it before, but I'd forgotten, was killed by the serfs when Dostoevsky was 11.

267
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:55,879
And Dostoevsky in here has Dimitri say, everyone wants to kill him.

268
00:24:56,439 --> 00:24:58,199
Everyone wants to kill his father.

269
00:24:58,199 --> 00:25:03,239
Freud, of course, his hair stood on end and thought, wow, this guy really understands something.

270
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:14,039
But Freud also said, I read somewhere, that he's not going to write anything more about this book because he sees enough sick people during his working hours.

271
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,320
He is not going to start reading Dostoevsky.

272
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:18,679
Go ahead.

273
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:19,959
What do you want to say?

274
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,800
The husband's or something?

275
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,360
No.

276
00:25:27,639 --> 00:25:29,399
So that was not his father's name.

277
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:31,320
Okay, good pointing out.

278
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,879
I admitted I didn't know.

279
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:42,679
But he gives his name to the name of the old father who.

280
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:44,199
No, I can't tell you any more plot.

281
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:46,679
Too much plot stuff that's going to come out if I say another word.

282
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:47,800
Okay, about that.

283
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,760
Let's go on.

284
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,719
I'm sorry every once in a while, but I certainly don't want to spoil this for you.

285
00:25:51,719 --> 00:25:58,840
As I say, this is one of the most complicated murder mysteries in the history of writing murder mysteries.

286
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,520
And it's not even clear.

287
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,639
Never mind.

288
00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:03,320
And I'm not going to talk about it.

289
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,600
Okay, here we go.

290
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,040
Back to where I am.

291
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,800
You keep reading.

292
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:11,559
So he's got a defining relation.

293
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,040
He relates himself to himself.

294
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:26,159
And he has, and now it's where I'm going to show you that he's like the Knight of Faith in Kierkegaard coming home thinking he's getting the stew and perfectly contented to get turnips.

295
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:35,120
At the bottom of 105, which is chapter 3, Confessions of a Passionate Heart in Verse, Alyasha, this is I've said already, but I'll show it to you.

296
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,279
Alyasha was certain that no one in the whole world ever would want to hurt him.

297
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,559
And what is more, he knew that no one could hurt him.

298
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:50,560
This was for him an axiom assumed once and for all and without hesitation, and he went his way without hesitation, without question.

299
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,959
And he went his way without hesitation, relying on it.

300
00:26:53,360 --> 00:27:03,840
That's to say that he lived in the field of faith in which all things are possible, and that he who was willing to accept the agony will get the bread.

301
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:14,719
It's the Christian picture that the world is a divine comedy, and in the end, in the world of the spirit, everything will always turn out all right.

302
00:27:14,719 --> 00:27:17,199
And Alyasha is tuned in on that.

303
00:27:17,199 --> 00:27:19,360
And for him, it always does.

304
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:35,999
And in a certain way, I think Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky both think if you are tuned in on that, you have such an optimistic, sunny, able to accept everything and see that it'll all be all right personality that it does turn out all right.

305
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:47,920
It's the defensive people, the vulnerable people who start feeling vulnerable or guilty and so forth, who mess up their lives, not people who like Alyasha.

306
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,559
That's what Dostoevsky thinks.

307
00:27:50,879 --> 00:28:03,160
So, now I say what I said to him.

308
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:05,879
Alyasha, though, is an untested knight of faith.

309
00:28:02,959 --> 00:28:07,800
He hasn't faced real suffering.

310
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:15,159
He won't even face real suffering in this book, but in the next book, which wasn't written, he was supposed to face more real suffering.

311
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:23,959
But he's got already inner doubts and understanding that there's something about himself that he can't deal with.

312
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,920
And that's why he's holding his ears already.

313
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:34,999
But now we hear more about that on 86, which is in A Young Man Bent on a Career.

314
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,959
The Young Man Bent on a Career is Rakitin.

315
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:39,799
You'll hear a lot about Rakitin.

316
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,679
Rakitin's a very important character in the book.

317
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:49,159
He understands more than any other character, I guess, except Zosima, what's really going on.

318
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:54,120
Zosima understands it because he turns Christian love into a science.

319
00:28:54,120 --> 00:29:03,239
Rakitin understands it because he's always listening in and prowling around and picking up gossip and trying very hard to know every deal.

320
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,799
He's a busybody and thereby knows lots of what's going on.

321
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:16,120
But he's also got, and I can't explain this yet, but I'll show you a funny fact that you will have to worry about and eventually we can find out.

322
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,040
But there he's talking to Alyasha.

323
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,920
He's talking about Dimitri first at the top of 86, saying this about Dimitri.

324
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:23,879
Why are you trembling?

325
00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:25,080
Let me tell you why.

326
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,159
Your Dimitri may be honest.

327
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:28,759
He is stupid but honest.

328
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,040
But he's sensual.

329
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,280
That's the definition and inner essence of him.

330
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:36,039
He's your father who handed on to him his low sensuality.

331
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,240
Of course, that's the dark side factor.

332
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:43,719
Do you know, I wonder at you, Alyasha, how you can have kept your purity.

333
00:29:43,719 --> 00:29:49,840
You're a Karamatsov, too, you know, in your family, sensuality is carried to a disease.

334
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:56,800
Now, and then, at the bottom of that page, Rakitin sort of turns on Alyasha.

335
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:07,919
I understand, let's see, even Dmitri, he's talking about how they're all sort of lusting after Grushenka.

336
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,039
Never mind that.

337
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,679
Alyasha says, I understand that.

338
00:30:12,239 --> 00:30:13,840
And Rakitin says, you do?

339
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,639
Well, I guess you do, since you blurt it out like that, said Rakitin maliciously.

340
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:20,240
It escaped you unawares.

341
00:30:20,239 --> 00:30:22,080
Your confession is revealing.

342
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,959
So it is a familiar subject you've thought about.

343
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:28,080
You've thought about it already, about sensuality, I mean.

344
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,279
Oh, you virgin soul, you're a quiet one, Alyasha.

345
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,719
You're a saint, I know.

346
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:35,919
But the devil only knows what you're thinking about.

347
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,919
Now, that's a wonderful line.

348
00:30:38,639 --> 00:30:42,399
You won't understand for a while why that line is so important.

349
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:48,639
What does it, oh, what if Rakitin is in some sense the devil?

350
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:51,840
That's why Rakitin says the devil only knows.

351
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:59,679
Dostoevsky has, you'll see lots more of this, but I haven't, we're not far enough along for me to tell you all about it yet.

352
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:11,840
Dostoevsky's got this way of translating certain sort of Christian symbols into common sense terms.

353
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,080
And when he does it, he always tells you that he's done it.

354
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,759
Nobody in any book I've ever seen has noticed this.

355
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,239
But this is just the first of many, many things.

356
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:24,959
Yes, Rakitin is the devil in a certain way.

357
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:29,199
And that's why the devil only knows what you're thinking about and what you know already.

358
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:31,919
You are pure, but you've been down into the depths.

359
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,639
And I've been watching you a long time.

360
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:35,399
You're a Karamatsov yourself.

361
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:37,080
You're a thorough Karamatsov.

362
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:38,600
Birth and heredity have shaped you.

363
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:43,159
You're a sensualist from your father and a crazy scent from your saint from your mother.

364
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:44,519
Why do you tremble?

365
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,799
It's true then.

366
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,800
You know, and there's this Grushenka hint.

367
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,760
You know, Grushenka has been begging me to bring you to her house.

368
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,039
I'll pull off his cassock, she says.

369
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,520
You can't imagine how she begs me to bring you.

370
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,999
I wondered why she takes such an interest in you.

371
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,559
You know, she's an extraordinary woman, too.

372
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,959
Thank her that say I'm not coming, says Alyasha with a strange smile.

373
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:11,880
Remember that later in the book, that's going to be important.

374
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:19,159
Okay, there's so many things that Dostoevsky's dropping, little clues that I can't tell you anything except pay attention.

375
00:32:19,719 --> 00:32:21,479
So now where are we?

376
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:30,520
So he withdraws from the world to get away from the sensual side.

377
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:42,920
He's going to be tested by his love of Zosima when Zasima dies, and let's suppose by Grushenka too.

378
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,720
And he has to face up to all these challenges, and we have to see how he deals with them.

379
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,199
Right now, his love of Zosima is holding everything together.

380
00:32:52,199 --> 00:32:54,839
He's not tempted by Grushenka.

381
00:32:54,839 --> 00:33:01,480
He's not worrying about Zasima not being there because he's there and so forth.

382
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,560
Okay, let's sum up now the four Karamatsaws.

383
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:12,920
So Foyodor is running from facing up to the contradictory impulses in itself.

384
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,080
That's the spiritlessness.

385
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,600
That's R1.

386
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,639
That's drunkenness and debauchery.

387
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:26,800
Ivan wants in despair to deny or repress what he calls his base or lackey side.

388
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:41,520
Dimitri is trying desperately to accept both factors and flipping back and forth, unable to define the factors, that is, angel, insect, Madonna, Sodom, in such a way that they could possibly ever be integrated.

389
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:49,360
And Alyasha has provisionally solved his problem by sublimating all his impulses into his love for Zosima.

390
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,520
Okay, that's sort of where we are.

391
00:33:53,839 --> 00:34:03,600
Now, I don't know, not too many times ago when I was teaching this, I ran into a huge problem.

392
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:10,639
Some very smart students said, but that doesn't sound right.

393
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:16,960
I mean, that's all fine for Dostoevsky, but why do you map that on Kierkegaard's view of the self?

394
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,840
What would Kierkegaard say about these factors?

395
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:27,359
Well, he wouldn't say that there are the bad factors and the good factors, the dark side and the light side, and so forth.

396
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:39,040
Kierkegaard thought that all the factors were equally good, if you want to say good, they were equally basic and important and essential.

397
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:52,080
That is, that's why he doesn't talk about good and bad, light and dark, body and soul, and gives them new names, where the finite is good and the infinite is good, and the temporal is good, and the eternal is good.

398
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,480
I should say positive or something instead of good.

399
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,279
They're all positive factors in the self.

400
00:34:57,279 --> 00:35:00,720
And Dostoevsky's story looks so different.

401
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:02,560
And it looks platonic.

402
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:20,920
It looks as if the heavenly side, the noble angel, Madonna, good, according to Grushenka, prayer side, is the all-positive, and the other side, base, insect, sodom, bad, and beast, is the bad side.

403
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:30,440
The only clue that this is not the whole story in the brothers is Zosima, who has the earthly and the heavenly sides.

404
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:39,400
And they don't sound nearly as incompatible as noble and base, angel and insect, good and bad, and so forth.

405
00:35:39,400 --> 00:36:00,760
So when I was sort of stung by this remark, then I had to think about it some more and decided that it isn't that Dostoevsky's picture of the self is platonic, meaning that half is good and half is essential, namely the eternal soul, half, and so forth, and half is something you should die to and get rid of.

406
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:10,920
It looks platonic because, and this is a subtle point, but you've got to get it, that the factors are defined differently by different people.

407
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:25,639
And all the people at the beginning of the book have got views of the factors that get them unable to put them together and make one side look positive and the other side look negative.

408
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:30,439
I hadn't realized till today that Alyasha has it too with light and dark.

409
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,040
You can't really put them together.

410
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,479
I'm just getting gray.

411
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,120
And that's not going to be the solution to anything.

412
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,439
So that's the important point.

413
00:36:38,759 --> 00:36:47,679
That at this stage, we're talking about the way the factors in the self or the heart look to the various characters.

414
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:53,520
To Yvonne, it looks like there's a dark side and a good side, and to Dmitri it does.

415
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:57,360
And Yvonne wants to be noble and get rid of the base.

416
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:02,319
Dimitri wants to get on the side of the Madonna and of the, what's the other one?

417
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:07,840
He's the angel, get rid of the insect and sodom, and so forth.

418
00:37:08,799 --> 00:37:12,159
So that's not what Kierkegaard is saying.

419
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:16,960
But it's that neither is it what Dostoevsky is saying.

420
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:25,280
Dostoevsky really wants us to understand that each side is equally essential, equally important, equally good.

421
00:37:25,279 --> 00:37:32,320
He just, on purpose here, he's setting it up for how it looks when you haven't understood that yet.

422
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:44,720
And if I say there's a hint to keep you from losing your way, Dezostima never loses his way, and then Zostima sees that the factors are equally basic and positive.

423
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:57,520
But so in Kierkegaard and in Dostoevsky, the factors look contradictory and incompatible if you relate to them in the wrong way.

424
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:08,480
But there's a way to relate to the factors, which keeps them from being contradictory and incompatible and makes them both equally essential and supporting each other.

425
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:14,320
And of course, that's always the R3 relation, but you have to do it by relating to another.

426
00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:16,560
And that's also Dostoevsky's view.

427
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,679
And so everything will be all right, in the end.

428
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:27,520
But it's important to both see how at this stage it looks like Kierkegaard and not like Kierkegaard.

429
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:35,159
And it has to come out in the end that the factors, when you get in the right relation to them, neither is bad.

430
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:40,840
And you have to have a relation among them, which I like to put the more of one, the more of the other.

431
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:42,840
The more time, the more eternity.

432
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:45,080
Eternity is only possible in time.

433
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:49,080
The more infinitude, the more infinitude, and all that.

434
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,720
I'm not going to go back over it.

435
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:54,679
So much, and now there somebody might want to say something.

436
00:38:54,679 --> 00:39:00,120
I mean, I hope I made it clear enough so that you aren't confused or lost.

437
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,960
It's fascinating.

438
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:13,400
So the bottom line is the factors are neutral in the sense that if you understand them some ways, they're opposed, but if you understand them in other ways, they go together.

439
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:23,799
And in the end, they go together because, in a way, they're this is a, in the world of the spirit, things work out all right.

440
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:31,879
You could have a world in which the factors just never got together, and the only honest people saw that it was hopeless and were in constant despair.

441
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:47,719
But that's not Dostoevsky's or Kierkegaard's world, because they're in the Christian world of the spirit, and they think that, to put it one more way, God became man, and therefore, somehow, like Pascal says, somehow Jesus got it together.

442
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:51,639
We don't know how, but we have to imitate him.

443
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,799
And they go further.

444
00:39:53,799 --> 00:39:58,760
They've got views about how to get it together, they mean Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky.

445
00:39:58,759 --> 00:40:04,279
Okay, that's the, that's clear enough.

446
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:07,320
No objections, no puzzles, you're not lost.

447
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:09,639
Okay, well, then we go into something that's fun.

448
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:12,600
I never don't know where to put this little episode.

449
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:17,079
I was running around, I was pushing it around in my computer in all sorts of different places.

450
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:19,759
I don't think there's any place to put it, so we'll put it here.

451
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:33,200
We haven't talked about anybody noticed that there may be somebody we should talk about that we haven't talked about among all the characters that have sort of Karamatsov's way.

452
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:35,360
Smerzhikov, exactly.

453
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:39,839
Well, I noticed the last time I gave it, I got I almost forgot Smershikov.

454
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,279
But anyway, I shouldn't.

455
00:40:41,279 --> 00:40:42,239
You mustn't.

456
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:45,280
He's a very important character in the book.

457
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:51,120
And it's also just absolutely a weird story to tell about him.

458
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,759
Okay, let's go over Smershikov.

459
00:40:53,759 --> 00:40:59,839
He's the son of Fyodor Karamatsov, yet nobody in the book calls him a Karamatsov.

460
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:00,319
I think.

461
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:03,840
If you ever find any place where anybody calls them a Karamatsov, let me know.

462
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:09,280
Moreover, he doesn't even seem to have any other name or a nickname or anything.

463
00:41:09,279 --> 00:41:11,679
And that's something strange about him.

464
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,280
It's partly, I think, because he's illegitimate.

465
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:23,600
But more basically, it's because he doesn't have the typical Karamatsov struggle within himself.

466
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:37,280
He doesn't have either the two contradictory sides of the self, or, if you want to put it more in the Dmitry Ivan language and even the Usher language, he doesn't have a good and a bad side of the self.

467
00:41:37,279 --> 00:41:40,560
Now let's follow that, because that's really fascinating.

468
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,919
And for Dostoevsky, that's going to turn out to be very important.

469
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,720
127, I think.

470
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:49,840
We should be in Smershikov territory.

471
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:54,159
Yep, that's chapter 6, Smeryshikov.

472
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:59,040
On second page, 127, we begin to hear about him.

473
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:04,839
And his old Theodore has a nickname for him, Balaam's ass.

474
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:08,439
I don't know what sort of myth or biblical thing that refers to.

475
00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:09,559
Anybody?

476
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,639
I never really worried about it.

477
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:13,319
Well, because nothing comes of it.

478
00:42:13,319 --> 00:42:16,600
Anyway, Balam's ass, it appeared, was the servant Smershikov.

479
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,880
I'm halfway down.

480
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,520
He was a young man of about 24.

481
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,240
24, by the way, is Yvonne's age.

482
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:25,240
That is no coincidence.

483
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:32,360
As you will see, there is an important way that Smershikov is very tightly related to Yvonne.

484
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:37,000
He's a young man of about 24, remarkably unsociable and self-contained.

485
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,600
Not that he was shy or bashful.

486
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,200
On the contrary, he was conceited and seemed to despise everyone.

487
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:44,279
Well, that's another way he's like Yvonne.

488
00:42:44,279 --> 00:42:46,599
Yvonne has contempt for everyone.

489
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:54,439
I guess maybe not Alyasha, but everyone else, certainly Dmitri and his father, and maybe not Katerina.

490
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:59,800
So maybe Smershikov is worse because he despises everyone.

491
00:42:59,799 --> 00:43:11,320
Now, then comes this amazing episode about him, which only if you're reading it the way I'm reading it, would you even think about it or notice it?

492
00:43:11,319 --> 00:43:15,000
I mean, I didn't even notice it at first because it is so wacky.

493
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,080
This, what is his pastime?

494
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,600
What is the thing he enjoys doing?

495
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,440
Does anybody remember?

496
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,320
Yeah.

497
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:24,839
No, he went to, that's interesting.

498
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:31,880
He went to Paris and he is the cook, and he did enjoy cooking and learned to cook, but that's not his pastime.

499
00:43:33,799 --> 00:43:34,279
No.

500
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,039
When something is sufficiently wacky, you can't see it.

501
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:38,679
Yeah.

502
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,880
Yes, he tortures cats and kills them, hangs them.

503
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:51,200
And then, I mean, as if that wasn't wacky enough, he says, Mat over them and gives them a good funeral.

504
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,839
I mean, this is the kind of thing I love about Dostoevsky in the book.

505
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:04,720
I mean, the only other person I know as a writer who could be equally outrageously far out that you can't imagine how I'd ever think about such a thing is Nabokov.

506
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:07,280
Maybe you have to be Russian to do this, I don't know.

507
00:44:07,279 --> 00:44:10,480
But whatever it is, there's something unbelievably wacky.

508
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,359
I'm going to read it to you.

509
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:12,639
It's just so great.

510
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:16,159
Worth reading the book just to come across it.

511
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:19,359
He was an unfriendly boy and seemed to look at the world with suspicion.

512
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:23,600
In his childhood, he liked to hang cats and bury them with great ceremony.

513
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:37,120
He used to dress up in a sheet as though it were a surplice, that's what priests wear, and sing and wave some object over the dead cat, the way they wave the incense over the Catholic Mass, as though it were a censer.

514
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,639
That's where the incense is.

515
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:42,159
All this he did on the sly with the greatest secrecy.

516
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:44,399
Okay, so I'll tell you why.

517
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,959
I mean, then you must ask yourself, why is Dostoevsky putting this in in there?

518
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,439
I'll tell you what, I think, in a minute, but let's finish reading this for a minute.

519
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,879
Gregory caught him once and beat him.

520
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,440
He shrank in a corner and salt there for a week.

521
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,960
He doesn't care for you or me, the beast, Gregory said to Martha.

522
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,920
That's his wife.

523
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,679
He doesn't care for anyone.

524
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:07,600
Then, speaking directly to the boy, he asks, Are you a human being?

525
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,040
You're not a human being.

526
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,120
You grew from the mildew in the bathhouse.

527
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,639
That's what you are.

528
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:15,199
Now, that's all pretty amazing.

529
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:16,479
Let's go over it.

530
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,639
What could be going on there?

531
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,840
Well, so I think it shows.

532
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,479
You have to ask, you have to, maybe I should back into this.

533
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,559
I'll come at a different angle.

534
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:37,479
The question, the interesting thing next to say about Smershikov is he doesn't have any factors.

535
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:39,240
He doesn't have a self.

536
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:44,839
He's not interested in anything.

537
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:54,120
that motivates anybody who has a self, neither lofty nor lecherous to form some new combination.

538
00:45:54,679 --> 00:45:59,960
On 129, we discover about a third of the way down.

539
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,600
He spent some years there, that is in Moscow.

540
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,440
That's where he learned to cook, not Paris.

541
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:07,399
He spent some years there and came back remarkably changed.

542
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,759
He looked old and so forth.

543
00:46:08,759 --> 00:46:09,560
That's not important.

544
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,400
Skip to the end of that paragraph.

545
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,559
He came back to us from Moscow, well dressed in a clean coat and clean linen.

546
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:25,400
He brushed his clothes most scrupulously twice a day and was very fond of cleaning his smart calf boots with a special English polish so that they shone like mirrors.

547
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:32,839
That's the most ambition he has, the most positive function he's got, is shining his boots.

548
00:46:32,839 --> 00:46:34,679
And always keep Yvonne in the background.

549
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:36,920
Yvonne is also impeccable.

550
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,959
You get the feeling.

551
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:47,560
I don't know where Dostoevsky says it, but I'm convinced that Yvonne has always got his hair cut and is impeccably dressed because he wants to be clean cut.

552
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,320
He wants to be impeccable.

553
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:55,800
Well, it's as if Smershikov is a parody of that, polishing his boots so that you can see your reflection in them.

554
00:46:55,799 --> 00:46:57,799
Well, maybe he's got the sensual side.

555
00:46:57,799 --> 00:46:58,359
Let's look.

556
00:46:58,359 --> 00:47:01,080
He turned out to be a first-rate cook, as he said.

557
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:08,679
Fedor Karamasa paid him a salary, almost the whole of which Smerychikov spent on clothes, pomade, or perfume, and such things.

558
00:47:08,679 --> 00:47:09,959
Maybe he was gay.

559
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,080
No, no.

560
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:16,120
But he seemed to have as much contempt for the female sex as for men.

561
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:19,120
He was discreet, almost unapproachable with them.

562
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,879
So he doesn't care about women.

563
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,400
He doesn't care about men.

564
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:24,159
He doesn't care about power.

565
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:26,159
He doesn't care about money.

566
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:28,080
He doesn't care about anything.

567
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:32,960
And in fact, he doesn't have any factors in himself.

568
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,639
And that's, and he doesn't have a self.

569
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:45,840
And the, and Gregory was right on 127 when he said, you're not a human being.

570
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,000
You grew from the mildew in the bathhouse.

571
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,639
That is, he, Gregory understands that Smerziakov is a kind of zombie or something.

572
00:47:54,639 --> 00:48:01,120
He lacks any motivation that comes from the factors in the self.

573
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,999
And Smerzhikov resented that.

574
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,960
He says, Smerzhikov, it appears afterward, could never forgive Gregory those words.

575
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,360
Well, what I think is, now let's go back to the cats.

576
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:16,639
And I think what Dostoevsky is doing, but I'm not sure.

577
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:20,399
And if you ask him, I don't know if he would know where he got this story about the cats.

578
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,320
But he's a pretty reflective character, and he probably knows what he's doing.

579
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:30,879
I think the cats are the last glimmer of the factors in Smershikov.

580
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:38,719
That is, there's the sadistic side that kills the cats and the lofty side that performs a beautiful funeral over them.

581
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:42,639
That's a pretty factory situation.

582
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:48,639
However, it looks like Gregory stamped out this when he said you're not a human being.

583
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,880
And Gregory remembers it all his life.

584
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:55,040
He never does, sorry, Smerzikov, he never does anything like that again.

585
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:02,560
He never, out of his own motivations, does anything nasty or lofty.

586
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:27,159
And my only way to think about that is that this memory, which he had all of his life of being told he wasn't a human being, somehow wiped out, instead of sort of trying to build on this minimal self and draw out of him the sadistic and the lofty, Gregory stamped it out once and for all.

587
00:49:27,159 --> 00:49:30,600
So Smershikov hasn't any lofty side.

588
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,600
He only can polish his boots.

589
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,520
And he hasn't any sensual side either.

590
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:39,639
That's why he's never called the Karamatsov, I'm pretty sure.

591
00:49:39,639 --> 00:49:41,480
You can check me.

592
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,679
And now comes an amazing puzzle.

593
00:49:44,679 --> 00:49:53,960
Think of yourself: if you were writing this novel and you wanted to give Smershikov some role in it, you have to give him some motivation.

594
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:58,120
But he hasn't got any motivation beyond polishing his boots.

595
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,040
And that, period.

596
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,319
Now, and Dostoevsky's got this interesting issue.

597
00:50:03,319 --> 00:50:07,560
He wants to give, you'll see, Smerzhikov a big role in this story.

598
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,840
But how is he going to give him any motivation to do anything?

599
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:13,159
It's a fascinating move now.

600
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:14,439
Just keep your eyes open.

601
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,519
It's just brilliant what he does.

602
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:16,999
Yeah.

603
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,120
Pavel, that's right.

604
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,159
He is at some point.

605
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:25,159
That must be his first name, you think?

606
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,319
Pavel Smershakov.

607
00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:28,279
I think you're right.

608
00:50:28,279 --> 00:50:30,440
But nobody ever calls him that.

609
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:36,199
Where is that?

610
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,480
Where is that?

611
00:50:38,759 --> 00:50:39,960
Ah.

612
00:50:40,279 --> 00:50:42,040
Before Confessions of a Paz.

613
00:50:43,159 --> 00:50:44,040
Which Confessions?

614
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,080
There are three chapters.

615
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:52,400
Now, but you have the same number of confessions in there somewhere.

616
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:53,919
105.

617
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,679
I see it's the first of the confessions.

618
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:56,159
Okay.

619
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:59,599
Where is he in the book?

620
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:10,639
Oh, you see, I'm learning something, but I haven't figured, I don't know where you are yet, but I've okay.

621
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:11,760
I'm looking.

622
00:51:11,759 --> 00:51:12,639
105.

623
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,240
Ah, yeah, there we are.

624
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:15,520
Okay, let me get a pen.

625
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:21,679
I will stop saying it is.

626
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:22,560
That's neat.

627
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,320
I should read my handouts.

628
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:25,120
What does it say?

629
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,280
What does it say on the handout?

630
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:33,440
Great.

631
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,759
But you know his last name, too.

632
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,920
Everybody knows a little something.

633
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,480
So I'm looking for a pen, so I won't say this next year.

634
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:44,959
Okay.

635
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,720
Thank you.

636
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:48,080
So here we go.

637
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:52,240
So, Smershikov.

638
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:53,520
Real name.

639
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,920
And why is he called Smershikov?

640
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,360
Is that what?

641
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:05,840
Yeah, it must mean something in Russian.

642
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,759
It means what?

643
00:52:11,279 --> 00:52:11,839
Wait, I don't.

644
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:13,280
Wait, what did you say?

645
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,120
The stinker.

646
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:16,639
Really?

647
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:18,879
Lots of stuff in here that I never noticed.

648
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,639
Can't keep track of everything.

649
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:21,679
There's the stinker.

650
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:22,880
I see that.

651
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,359
Yeah?

652
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,080
Okay.

653
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:25,719
All I don't want to fit.

654
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:26,480
Okay.

655
00:52:26,799 --> 00:52:35,319
But I stick to, and I mean, if he'd been called Karamatsov, I might have given up and stopped teaching the book because he better not be.

656
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:38,600
But that's all right to all that, but we just learned something.

657
00:52:32,799 --> 00:52:38,839
Okay.

658
00:52:39,319 --> 00:52:50,200
Now, the other big thing to talk about: wow, time runs by so fast, but we've got to do a whole other chunk, hopefully, today, and that is childhood memories.

659
00:52:50,199 --> 00:52:56,360
Because we've done only half of the Dostoevsky view about the brothers and how they got that way.

660
00:52:56,359 --> 00:53:04,279
There's a hint already in Smerzhikov that there's a kind of negative childhood memory that's causing a lot of sort of wiped him out.

661
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,760
We want to learn a lot more about that.

662
00:53:06,759 --> 00:53:15,080
Dostoevsky thinks not only do people become what they are by their heredity, but they become what they are by what they experience.

663
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,679
That's hardly a big deal.

664
00:53:16,679 --> 00:53:18,200
I mean, most people know that.

665
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:20,600
I mean, Freud certainly knows that.

666
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:24,679
But Dostoevsky has a very different view than Freud.

667
00:53:24,679 --> 00:53:40,440
His view is that people are influenced by very important memories, but not negative memories, but, except in this case of Smershikov, but generally positive memories.

668
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,360
And so we have to look into that.

669
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:46,519
You can see already that there is this heredity thing.

670
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:59,960
We talked about that, where Dimitri has a personality like his mother, and both Yvonne and Alyasha have the same meek mother, Sophia, but they turn out to be, and now comes the interesting thing, terribly different.

671
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:12,280
They share two variations of her quest, her religion, but one of them is very religious, Alyasha, and one of them is totally unreligious, Yvonne.

672
00:54:12,279 --> 00:54:26,239
In fact, it turns out to be Dmitry who is also religious, and that is, they all are in the Christian dimension, worried about love, worried about despair and salvation, and so forth.

673
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:28,319
They, meaning Alyasha and Dimitri.

674
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:34,720
So now we've got, so it can't be heredity that determines who's in the spiritual world and who isn't.

675
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:42,400
Because one of Sophia's children is in the spiritual world, and one of whatever her name is, I forget.

676
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:45,360
What was his first wife's name?

677
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:47,919
Adelaida.

678
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,280
One of Adelaide's children is in the spiritual world and one isn't.

679
00:54:51,279 --> 00:54:52,720
How do we account for that?

680
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:55,840
Well, the way we account for that is quite amazing.

681
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:05,679
Dostoevsky thinks, in a way like Freud, that childhood experiences have a big effect on people's personality.

682
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:07,920
But Freud thinks that they're bad.

683
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,679
They're traumas, as he calls them, injuries of sorts.

684
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:26,639
Alyasha, sorry, Dostoevsky has what is perhaps a unique idea, I've never seen any place else, that there are crucial childhood memories that shape the whole future of somebody who has them.

685
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:30,399
And now we're going to discover two of them, and they are really amazing.

686
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,400
On 30.

687
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:41,040
We're back in Alyasha chapters, and he has his childhood memory, and it's all complicated.

688
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,639
And where does he go?

689
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:45,520
Starting in this first full paragraph.

690
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:54,240
I mentioned earlier, by the way, that although he lost his mother in his fourth year, he remembered her all his life, her face, her caresses, as though she stood before me.

691
00:55:54,239 --> 00:56:09,639
Such memories may persist, as everyone knows, from an even earlier age, even from two years old, but they seldom stand out against out through a whole life like spots of light out of darkness, like a corner turned from a picture.

692
00:56:09,639 --> 00:56:12,120
And that's how it was with him.

693
00:56:12,839 --> 00:56:17,240
He, now, here's the room: here's the memory, a very crucial thing.

694
00:56:17,239 --> 00:56:23,080
He remembered one still summer evening, an open window, the slanting rays of the setting sun.

695
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,960
He recalled this most vividly of all.

696
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:31,240
Now, I can only sort of set you up to notice how strange that is.

697
00:56:31,239 --> 00:56:34,600
Because you're about to have a dozen or maybe three.

698
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,480
But anyway, crazy things are about to happen.

699
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:41,000
And what he remembers is the rays of the setting sun.

700
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,400
Now, I don't know, again, anybody who's noticed this, but keep your eyes open.

701
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:50,520
Every time something important happens to Alyasha, there are rays of setting sun.

702
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,359
And that's not just a coincidence.

703
00:56:52,359 --> 00:56:56,199
That's tied to the absolute deepest issue in the book.

704
00:56:56,199 --> 00:56:57,399
And I can't tell you more.

705
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,080
I just tell you to notice.

706
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,399
He remembers the slanting rays of the setting sun.

707
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,040
Those he recalled most vividly of all.

708
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,759
Now comes the stuff he doesn't recall quite so vividly.

709
00:57:06,759 --> 00:57:12,280
In the corner of the room, the holy image, that is an icon, the Virgin.

710
00:57:12,279 --> 00:57:14,200
And that could be important.

711
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:17,560
You'd think that'd be more important than the rays of the setting sun, wouldn't you?

712
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,359
I would.

713
00:57:18,679 --> 00:57:19,399
But it is.

714
00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:21,879
It won't turn out to be when the book gets all clear.

715
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:34,519
In the corner of the room, the holy image, before it, a lighted lamp, and on her knees before the image, his mother, sobbing hysterically with cries and moans, snatching him up in both arms, squeezing him till it hurt, and praying for him to the mother of God.

716
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,120
That's the image.

717
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:40,760
Holding him out in both arms to the image as though to put him under the mother's protection.

718
00:57:40,759 --> 00:57:44,759
And suddenly a nurse runs in and snatches him from her in terror.

719
00:57:44,759 --> 00:57:46,480
Well, that's quite a memory.

720
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:51,599
And that memory sticks with him all his life.

721
00:57:52,239 --> 00:58:00,639
It is, in effect, what makes him do the religious things that he does later in life.

722
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,079
That is, that's what guides him when he becomes a monk.

723
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:18,560
So in the elders' chapter, you find out on 38, perhaps his memories of childhood brought back our monastery to which his mother may have taken him to Mass.

724
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:22,879
Perhaps the slanting sunlight doesn't take long, does it, for this to take effect.

725
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:28,320
And the holy image to which his poor crazy mother had held him up still worked upon his imagination.

726
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:32,800
And brooding on these things, in effect, he goes into the monastery.

727
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:35,600
So the memory is already leading him.

728
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:45,440
The memory has put him into a certain dimension, you'll find out, where love, salvation, and trust are the crucial things for him.

729
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:49,040
Yvonne, it turns out, has no childhood memory.

730
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:55,120
And that's, in a way, why Yvonne of the Three Brothers is out of the spiritual dimension.

731
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,560
But you won't believe me.

732
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:59,919
You're looking at me rightly with total incredulousness.

733
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:05,439
But I will show you that this is much more interesting and surprising than you could ever imagine.

734
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:11,120
But you have to look way back on page 636 before the other shoe drops.

735
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,679
And then, and I'm not going to tell you the plot.

736
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:17,120
Nothing important plot-wise is going to affect you.

737
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:28,240
But there is a scene in which an old German doctor is testifying in court to meet to Dimitri's good character.

738
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:39,879
And now, this is, I have to tell you with other people, it's in book three, I mean chapter three of some long, long book called Dangerous Witnesses.

739
00:59:40,199 --> 00:59:46,040
It's right at the end, right before another chapter four, Fortune smiles on Dimitri.

740
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,799
Okay, now I'm going to read you all this.

741
00:59:47,799 --> 00:59:53,000
This is a very strange event, almost as strange as the cat's in its own way.

742
00:59:53,000 --> 01:00:00,759
About 15 lines from the bottom, the doctor's testifying, and he says, oh yes, I was a young man, a young man then.

743
01:00:00,759 --> 01:00:02,840
This is an old German doctor I was.

744
01:00:02,839 --> 01:00:06,360
Well, I was 45 then and had only just come here.

745
01:00:06,359 --> 01:00:10,039
And I was so sorry for the child then, that was Dimitri.

746
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:13,560
I asked myself, why wouldn't I buy him a pound of nuts?

747
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:16,520
See, the little chap, well, I better back up a little.

748
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:21,320
I remember him well, a little chap, so high, left neglected by his father.

749
01:00:21,319 --> 01:00:22,919
He ran in the backyard.

750
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:27,560
He ran without boots on his feet, and his little breeches were hanging by one button.

751
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,800
Then now back to where we are.

752
01:00:29,799 --> 01:00:33,159
I'm going to buy him a pound of, a pound of what?

753
01:00:33,159 --> 01:00:34,919
This is just Ostovsky having fun.

754
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,359
I've forgotten what it's called.

755
01:00:36,359 --> 01:00:38,759
A pound of what children are very fond of.

756
01:00:38,759 --> 01:00:39,159
What is it?

757
01:00:39,159 --> 01:00:39,799
What is it?

758
01:00:39,799 --> 01:00:41,159
The doctor began waving his hand.

759
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:44,279
It grows on a tree and is gathered and given to someone.

760
01:00:44,279 --> 01:00:44,919
Apples?

761
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:45,800
No, no.

762
01:00:45,799 --> 01:00:49,000
I think you sell apples by the dozen, not by the pound.

763
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,560
So there's a lot of them, all little ones, and you put them in your mouth and they go crack.

764
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:54,199
Nuts.

765
01:00:54,199 --> 01:00:55,800
Ah, yes, nuts.

766
01:00:55,799 --> 01:00:59,719
Okay, that's just Ostovsky freaking out with fun.

767
01:01:01,239 --> 01:01:03,880
But now comes the really fun part.

768
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:09,000
The doctor repeated this in the calmest way as though he had been at no loss for the word.

769
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,439
I bought him a pound of nuts, for no one had ever bought him a pound of nuts.

770
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:16,679
And I lifted my finger and I said to him, boy, got their father.

771
01:01:16,679 --> 01:01:18,559
And he laughed and said, Got their father.

772
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:19,599
Got their son.

773
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,839
And he laughed again and listened, got their son.

774
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:23,279
And got their Heiligegeist.

775
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:27,120
And he laughed and said as best he could, Got their Heiligegeist.

776
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:30,400
You recognize what that is?

777
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:32,560
How many know any German?

778
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:33,280
What?

779
01:01:35,279 --> 01:01:36,400
It's German.

780
01:01:36,719 --> 01:01:40,800
It's God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.

781
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:44,400
Okay, we'll find out now later in a minute why that's important.

782
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,439
Then he laughed.

783
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:53,120
Okay, I went away, and two days later, I happened to be passing, and he shouted to me, Uncle, got their father, got their son.

784
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,439
He had only forgotten Gotta Healigegeist.

785
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,960
And I reminded him of it, and I felt very sorry for him again.

786
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,360
Then he was taken away, and I didn't see him again.

787
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:02,959
23 years passed.

788
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:16,559
I'm sitting one morning in my study, a bald-headed old man, when there walks into the room a blooming young man who I would never have recognized, except that he held up his finger and said, laughing, Got their father, got their son, got their Heiligegeist.

789
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:21,359
I've just arrived and come to thank you for the pound of nuts, for no one ever bought me a pound of nuts.

790
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:23,360
You're the only one who ever did.

791
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:25,280
And then, and so forth.

792
01:02:25,759 --> 01:02:26,879
And then, well, let's see.

793
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,280
I guess that's the main thing.

794
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,159
Then they embrace each other and cry.

795
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:34,799
So, what's going on there?

796
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:38,000
Why are we being told this weird story?

797
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,359
And why that German, those German words?

798
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:44,719
Does anybody see what Dostoevsky is doing?

799
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:45,439
I doubt it.

800
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,879
You have to read it lots of times.

801
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:47,760
Yes.

802
01:02:55,040 --> 01:03:24,360
Well, yeah, well, no one has ever brought him into the religious dimension of love and caring, and the German doctor does, and it gives him a childhood memory, which he remembers all of his life, and that's the facts, and therefore, that, like the memory of Aliyah shared with his mother, puts him in this dimension of love and damnation and salvation, which he wouldn't have if he didn't have these words fed over him.

803
01:03:24,359 --> 01:03:25,079
What is it?

804
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:28,120
Christians, you must recognize, what am I talking about?

805
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,000
Yeah.

806
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:30,919
Yeah, that's the Holy Dream.

807
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,120
Where do you say it over?

808
01:03:32,359 --> 01:03:34,360
Little kids.

809
01:03:34,359 --> 01:03:35,239
Baptism.

810
01:03:35,239 --> 01:03:36,599
It's a baptism.

811
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:39,879
That's what Dostoevsky is up to.

812
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:41,879
That's an important episode.

813
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:45,399
It's a clue to what the whole book is up to on another level.

814
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,839
I mean, there's so many levels in the book.

815
01:03:46,839 --> 01:03:49,080
We're now not in the murder mystery business.

816
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,760
We're in the spiritual business.

817
01:03:50,759 --> 01:03:59,320
What's happening is Dostoevsky is giving you the existential meaning of baptism.

818
01:03:59,319 --> 01:04:06,920
That is, what baptism isn't people saying foreign words over babies and throwing water on them.

819
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,279
That's just magical.

820
01:04:08,279 --> 01:04:12,679
Dostoevsky doesn't have any interest in that magical kind of Christianity.

821
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:19,239
He thinks that everything had better be commensurate with the laws of physics and chemistry.

822
01:04:19,239 --> 01:04:20,839
That is, he'll say that later.

823
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:26,359
He talks about he wants to save the truth.

824
01:04:26,359 --> 01:04:28,360
He doesn't say this, but I say this.

825
01:04:28,359 --> 01:04:33,239
But he says he believes in the truth of physics and chemistry.

826
01:04:33,239 --> 01:04:35,799
He believes in the latest neuroscience, you'll see.

827
01:04:35,799 --> 01:04:44,600
There's an important point in the book where Dimitri is told that there are neurons that have just been discovered by Claude Bernard in Paris, and he's got to cope with that.

828
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:52,639
But Dostoevsky thinks, sure, they're neurons, and physics and chemistry is going to explain all the material world, and neuroscience is going to explain the brain.

829
01:04:52,639 --> 01:05:04,720
And if Christianity gets into some kind of magical state where it sort of runs up headlong into science, Christianity is definitely going to lose.

830
01:05:04,719 --> 01:05:15,840
So he's got a project in this book, which, again, I don't know anybody else, one who has such a project, and I don't know anybody writing about the brothers who sees that he has this project, but it's very important.

831
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:24,639
It's to save the truth of Christianity in such a way that it never comes into conflict with physics and chemistry, with science.

832
01:05:24,639 --> 01:05:39,040
And the way you do it is you take all the sacraments, all the important things, and more than the sacraments, every important symbol in Christianity, and you translate it from something magical into something existential.

833
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,440
And you've seen it happen twice.

834
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:49,040
Once in the baptism of Alyasha, that's what was happening when she held him up and dedicated him to the Virgin.

835
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:53,200
And that put him in the spiritual dimension for the rest of his life.

836
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:57,120
And the German doctor, and this is Dostoevsky always hitting you over the head with it.

837
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:07,600
I mean, unless you haven't noticed that these people's childhood memories are existentialized baptism, he just tells it to you.

838
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:18,800
There's somebody saying these foreign words over him, which are the baptism words, and Dimitri gets a childhood memory which influences his behavior for the rest of his life.

839
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:19,720
Now, I'm going to.

840
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:21,599
Anybody want to say anything about that?

841
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:35,639
The moral of this is that you have to keep your eyes open for, and I'm going to give you a list in a minute of all the things that Dostoevsky is going to existentialize or demagicalize.

842
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:36,919
It's the same point.

843
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:38,359
Let's see now where we are, though.

844
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:58,679
Baptism is the sacrament that gives the soul the possibility of being saved or also damned, and it makes you open to love, and it's a condition, or it makes it possible for you to love and be loved.

845
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:02,120
That's what Dostoevsky thinks baptism really is.

846
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:06,679
And he doesn't care about the water and the words.

847
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:19,000
It turns out that that's why Alyasha and Dmitri, even though they've got different mothers, are both in the religious dimension, because they've both got these positive childhood memories.

848
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:28,040
And that's why Yvonne, although he has a religious mother, isn't in the religious and the spiritual dimension, because he never got any childhood memories.

849
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:39,000
And I think it's why Smerzhikov has no self, because he's got a childhood memory of being told that he's not a human being and has no self.

850
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,799
And remember, it says, and he never forgot it.

851
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:46,199
Well, part of the clue is that all these are bits of eternity in time.

852
01:07:46,199 --> 01:08:06,199
These three memories, Smershikov's memory of being told he had no self, and the love and the dedication to the spiritual of Yvonne, sorry, of Alyasha and Dmitri, are all in the eternal, in the forever dimension, because there's something that they never forget.

853
01:08:06,519 --> 01:08:09,080
So all this is happening in there in a hurry.

854
01:08:12,519 --> 01:08:13,399
Now.

855
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:21,439
So people, there is a whole tradition.

856
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:24,880
Dostoevsky didn't invent it, though I don't think he knew about it.

857
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,479
So he invented it on his own.

858
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:28,479
Dostoevsky invented lots of things on his own.

859
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,879
You'll see later he invented Nietzsche on his own.

860
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:34,239
He invented, you invented terrorism, maybe, maybe not.

861
01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:36,399
Maybe there was terrorism around already.

862
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:41,040
Just an aside, the book, The Possessed, The Devils, have any of you read it?

863
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:50,479
It's about a terrorist cell that they're just trying to convince the Russians that there are lots of them, and they're committing all kinds of outrageous crimes.

864
01:08:50,479 --> 01:09:00,639
I was teaching The Possessed in 1970 when I had in my class Patty Hearst, and Steve Weed was one of the TAs.

865
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,799
You recognize those people?

866
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:05,439
And the book was just like reality.

867
01:09:05,599 --> 01:09:10,080
One day Steve Weed came in all beat up, and Patty Hearst disappeared.

868
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:15,679
And this was all about the Simonese Liberation Army.

869
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:21,679
And it was all about this small terrorist cell, the book I was reading, The Possessed, and what was happening there.

870
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:25,919
And so Dostoevsky, that's an aside, invents all sorts of strange things.

871
01:09:26,239 --> 01:09:32,639
But right now, he's inventing what in Germany was called demythologizing.

872
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:39,040
And there was a famous theologian, this was after Dostoevsky, whether Boldman was his name, you don't need to know that.

873
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:43,679
Whether Bultmann knew Dostoevsky and knew he was demythologizing, I have no idea.

874
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:51,120
It would be fun if anybody had took the trouble to read Boldman and find out, look in the index and see if he talks about Dostoevsky.

875
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,880
I should do it if I get time.

876
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,319
I think I will do it.

877
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:57,040
It sounds like an interesting question.

878
01:09:59,599 --> 01:10:10,599
But anyway, when I talked about it as demythologizing, like demythologizing baptism, some smart students said you couldn't really call it demythologizing.

879
01:10:10,599 --> 01:10:11,960
Myths are a good thing.

880
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,639
You don't want to get rid of myths.

881
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:21,000
I mean, where would the Iliad and the Odyssey and the Homeric Greeks be without their gods and their myths?

882
01:10:21,239 --> 01:10:25,080
What you want is something like demagicalizing.

883
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:33,239
That is, you want to take out of Christianity any elements that come around and contradict the laws of physics and chemistry.

884
01:10:33,239 --> 01:10:35,880
So I call it demagicalizing.

885
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:44,919
And I call, and I'm saying you do it by finding the existential truth in the Christian symbols.

886
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:55,159
Now, I'll just stop by reading you a whole list of symbols, all of which get demagicalized and existentialized in the course of this book.

887
01:10:55,159 --> 01:10:56,439
Here they go.

888
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:08,679
He fixes confession, the incarnation, ordination of priests, the crucifixion, immortality.

889
01:11:09,319 --> 01:11:11,479
He shows you angels.

890
01:11:11,479 --> 01:11:13,399
He shows you devils.

891
01:11:13,399 --> 01:11:19,639
And the hardest one and the most fun that you have to wait a while is he demagicalizes miracles.

892
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:26,199
I mean, after all, that's a tough move since miracles are by definition, you would think, against the laws of physics and chemistry.

893
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:34,599
But he, no, no, he's got an existential truth even in miracles that is totally compatible with physics, chemistry, and neuroscience.

894
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:41,799
In each of those cases, he's going to show you the existential meaning of those Christian symbols.

895
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:43,479
One second, then I'll go.

896
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:55,759
And he's going to, and just as he did with those German words, he's going to tell you, hit you over the head if you're watching, with what symbol he's just demythologized.

897
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:59,519
That's sort of a fun thing to watch when you're reading the book, when you're looking for it.

898
01:11:59,519 --> 01:12:02,479
Because it's so, I mean, it's like a joke.

899
01:12:02,479 --> 01:12:04,319
He's going to tell you, but nobody sees it.

900
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:06,319
But he's going to put, like Rakutin.

901
01:12:06,319 --> 01:12:08,880
I mean, you saw already, I just, you haven't seen enough.

902
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:13,279
But I told you Rakitin is now a demagicalized devil.

903
01:12:13,279 --> 01:12:14,799
I can use that word.

904
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,479
And what about Rakitin?

905
01:12:16,479 --> 01:12:19,839
He says the devil only knows when he knows something.

906
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:27,199
It's that little kind of hint that Dostoevsky will tell you, and Rakitin is going to behave more and more and more like a devil as the book goes on.

907
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:29,040
Now, what do you want to say?

908
01:12:35,359 --> 01:12:36,800
Aren't he Gregory?

909
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:38,880
Do you mean the bonus of Job?

910
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,880
And that's the one in the Bible he's reading?

911
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:45,519
That's him, reinterpreting the figure of Job into common sense.

912
01:12:47,519 --> 01:12:49,599
I don't think so.

913
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:54,880
The only reason I don't think so is I don't see him behaving like Job.

914
01:12:54,880 --> 01:13:03,839
I mean, it's the kind of thing which if Gregory did behave like Job, then this would be the way Dostoevsky would hit you with it.

915
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,759
