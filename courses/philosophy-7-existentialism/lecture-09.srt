00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
I think it's easier to experience the past is the point.

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:21,440
I think this all the things together, not just galaxies, but because you think I have fixed, and he's glad you see that.

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:35,120
But then it turns out that all of these things is the only one that knows that he's all these to say is I follow him.

4
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:44,240
And as soon as he discovers the law, it's not just his all the ballad and the video for him.

5
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,159
That's a one-in-flight here.

6
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:55,120
I said I'll have to say the idea is put our fingerprint smile system.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,880
But it was so for just so far.

8
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:10,200
So it was pretty much dozens of steel where we need to work differently.

9
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,320
No, he doesn't have to be anything.

10
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:22,280
It's just that other things are not so easy and violent in what he does.

11
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,920
What if you want to go in school?

12
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:40,760
And he's saying that the impact given us.

13
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,880
But I think you get the other stuff.

14
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:53,639
He wants to, especially because he might have a signal involved.

15
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:10,359
And the other thing because there is an effort that is ready to use four hours.

16
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:39,079
And he knows that there could be a that you are using his own and he expressed the having an agreement with points of so it's funny that the show was fun with him and when the thing made everything seem fine and software state.

17
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:53,199
But he kills us and he gives her away the college that's dangerous and to kill the shock people what kind of difference it is is important.

18
00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:03,039
He just seems ruthless and skeletal and just really wears about the college his desperate.

19
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:20,559
He really tells them that this is my new view seriously how much he tells him if you have why did you go to trouble with this community carrying the railroads in order to come well what makes you so doing?

20
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:25,919
Well, he's ready to spare anyone to save his own skin.

21
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:33,599
If there's nothing that's a higher or line of authority for it.

22
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,839
It's all what?

23
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,559
He comes close to being the person you all want to know about.

24
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:44,319
Somebody who has a person has an unconditional significance of good stuff.

25
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,319
He couldn't put it there.

26
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,079
It doesn't just give them an identity because it's sort of empty and circular.

27
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,639
There's no concept of having a season.

28
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,799
If the only uncommon thing in this world is him, is what?

29
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:13,319
He he's ready to kill his guest public.

30
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:17,519
Hey, the missed close by also to the reference to protect himself.

31
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,720
It doesn't have a reference to the reference sense of the way that it is.

32
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:32,680
I believe it doesn's the first thing I think it's sort of interesting.

33
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,439
I couldn't say this at the moment.

34
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,439
You know, all of those shots and failure business.

35
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:50,919
And I think the four is always the rest of the IP identity paper only, not necessarily the URLs.

36
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,599
I think they want very good to the form.

37
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:57,240
They think that's not as important as I don't know.

38
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:57,639
Why?

39
00:04:58,039 --> 00:04:59,079
What is wrong?

40
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:08,119
By the way, we're talking over the next power notes.

41
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:25,000
Uh lines are strange.

42
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:33,480
He uh he draws part the arrow on the window of the fairish wood sticks.

43
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:47,240
What can I do all that uh one of the URLs that I have to find obviously somewhere else we have to stick to the we couldn't on one away.

44
00:05:52,039 --> 00:06:02,279
Okay now one away we got a you're gonna be a pack upon a file.

45
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:11,119
You know, if it is five and a few, it means that what we are doing is contact.

46
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:15,760
Now, uh, marketing is better than the other jobs.

47
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:34,079
You want to get better and different that when it's just give her away we can do that rather than what we're using.

48
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,760
That is just similar to the skitties.

49
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,960
All these chat buttons, all these statistics.

50
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:59,359
Uh, you say the risk, but what are the strings is always difficult.

51
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:05,439
When Tom is out, it just gives us a threat.

52
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,799
Then it turns out all the things are good.

53
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:14,879
Something's revived his brain because you're betrayed and feels his clothes for love.

54
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,639
That's what he is.

55
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,359
People are having a different green no song.

56
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:21,439
The people are bottom up now.

57
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:26,399
He does not want to get permanently targeted.

58
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:45,200
All betrayers are trying to set up an internet with you that you.

59
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:50,479
The hacker looks very close makes him attached to you.

60
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,960
It's not that lower.

61
00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:00,599
He doesn't think he just makes him step.

62
00:07:54,559 --> 00:08:01,559
It's worth it.

63
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:06,600
It's uh people who love each other.

64
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:19,960
If you kind of say that in the less close left, or you don't have my lens next to the symbols.

65
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,000
No it is, but you can't really see it in the last movie.

66
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:31,160
You could see it in Spring.

67
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:41,159
So the reading of the springs is just uh how much they used to believe in that.

68
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,240
And this semester study is not respected.

69
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:51,079
I think that men have to do seven years.

70
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,400
Oh, and a scale duple involved, not worse than all.

71
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,240
The damn factor is just miss much here.

72
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,039
So that's the end of this.

73
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:13,399
It's a chance that you can use how this one is joyful and destroyed.

74
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:24,840
So that idea is that people don't miss much of the poor devils and everything.

75
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,480
Or it's not what it's to be and these nights either.

76
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,359
That's because everybody put it on.

77
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:39,159
You see that in the way that you often see all the followers in the darkness and see it.

78
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,760
The blacks literally see a different ball.

79
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:25,519
So far, as second thing you know bigger, it has created using this, or if it's not wrong, is yeah.

80
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,839
What's the problem?

81
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,039
You really got something at the end.

82
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:16,240
All of the entry-controlled guys are new, and you need to understand why people are thinking.

83
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,159
Why did it not have to be like not working?

84
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,279
Why did it not fit into the asset of the misuses?

85
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:27,079
And what's interesting is from the top of the fair Studio, we're just from the first home.

86
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,039
Thank you.

87
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,080
You start spawning to get to say you're not supposed to.

88
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,720
You're not supposed to go in spots.

89
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,359
But because there's no hurtful up there, they're not.

90
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:54,440
I think you can figure out the ethical that the fact you can note this kind of technology facility or the galaxy.

91
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:59,720
Maybe not people that people were doing for minds.

92
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:14,760
That's the bar of the fair people where it takes fun to talk about anything but not forgetting they're talking about the frames of real person.

93
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,200
And they're talking about the statements.

94
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:28,119
I think the religious events can be something that's one which I do want to talk about.

95
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:42,680
Is the ethical and seems to be the person on the ground floor with one religious book.

96
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,719
Ignorant.

97
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:48,839
Okay, good idea was to have it out.

98
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:56,279
So, oh, so Ollie's not religious at all.

99
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,279
That doesn't mean just not religious.

100
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,039
He is just all explaining what it religions.

101
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,319
I guess they're all starting things.

102
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,680
Well, one thing more than one is going to be hard to.

103
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:51,119
The final channel is when he's in fact influenced off and surrounded by all those subject language of his knowledge.

104
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:55,919
He says what a nice collection of stuff you have.

105
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:58,720
It doesn't even know what it is.

106
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,839
I think that's any proof.

107
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:28,720
Hey, it may be that it goes to the 80s to fitness decorations to allegories or something positive.

108
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,600
I'm just getting all of these.

109
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:53,560
I'm going to go in the afternoon.

110
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:25,159
There's your and there's similar things the top in the finest words.

111
00:15:25,240 --> 00:16:13,079
So here's the first means of the top of this perpendicular button.

112
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:22,839
So that's what we do.

113
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:28,119
West, it's a task.

114
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:32,760
There's an unconditional commitment to colour.

115
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,879
And then won't betray that with your own.

116
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,599
You've got unconditional commitment if you can.

117
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:11,160
Now why does that support security?

118
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:20,760
So he is a threat to investigators because now we have no intelligence with space where you know you can go on filling more people.

119
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:30,760
Because we're doing a surprise because I was going to send our lives.

120
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:53,080
Now if you want to see because I'm spending time to lessen out the building, if that never minds being on a given that he's in cruising, and that means that those things were set to the other.

121
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,960
And everything else being equal, a body started.

122
00:19:57,959 --> 00:25:16,879
There's one thing present on high authority in our lives with the ethical so what what is she doing that is very good phones yeah what the sense here it should also be metal these are the screens the ethical thing with the second stage witness all so speed or I think ethical actually does something screwed look at it here's the ethical dangers that's important really to want to wait when the she says that I'm going to talk and want to have it faster all these methods those at least top which is still being secured after it does change or if that I think it's going to get a good thing not to make this or whatever No, no, no, no, no.

123
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,319
There is no ethical principle like you could be possible.

124
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:24,240
And you can have the ethical principles of love and the farm expertise.

125
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,200
And you can say something if the animal seems an interesting point.

126
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:35,720
It would be self-attractive.

127
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,080
You could hurt the person you love.

128
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:52,359
And because a universal principle doesn't need to get good thing, well, but suppose there's a higher ethical person who loves it going on to fire ethical witch.

129
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,839
He's good, you know, turned in here.

130
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:57,240
And that's only a suspicion.

131
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:59,959
Oh, that is like the fancy hero.

132
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:04,040
You have to give us your lover from involved in the police.

133
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,799
But you gotta do it.

134
00:26:05,959 --> 00:26:08,920
He does it without principle.

135
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:12,120
He does it without because.

136
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,399
I don't want to put it.

137
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:17,559
It's not a general principle of staying through your lover.

138
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,039
We couldn't stop by higher ethical principle.

139
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:27,640
It's well, it's very high and deal anything down.

140
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:32,519
Um, and you can't make it into what you're supposed to do.

141
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,439
I mean, the very difficult principle.

142
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:40,760
But you could turn out the way I describe doing.

143
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:45,960
You can turn anything kind of damage into a universal ethical principle.

144
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:54,040
What does the least begone for emotions or commitment emotions that are too well immediate?

145
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:59,319
That's the point we was defined for a while.

146
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,519
It's not per life.

147
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:42,000
It's not a principle that we can say is universal ethical turn out to be very well supernatural.

148
00:28:02,959 --> 00:28:12,640
I think you can see the installation, but still anyways.

149
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:17,919
Okay, let's just take the other thing.

150
00:28:17,999 --> 00:28:19,999
I don't know what's going on.

151
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:24,799
Oh, yeah, things have finger up.

152
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:25,760
Name the one.

153
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:33,279
The solution would have third is my Y at a move.

154
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,359
Because it's a really false thing.

155
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,519
It might kind of bring several things to the effect.

156
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:56,399
But if anyone is the one thing that is using blue, and there's nothing to use in zero X and the house worse, I mean the murds.

157
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:05,240
I can give them a rubber intelligence over the top and that's not how this genus game is worth or whatever, it's just a different thing.

158
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:09,079
That's what it is because it's the difference of the other one.

159
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:13,960
But now, having said that, people don't use this.

160
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:20,039
Nothing else, which I think is a tiny brand here that I have to talk about, is financial.

161
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:29,480
If I'm not able to make a statement, there are high diversity notions to the fix they have for a pair of lost.

162
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:36,120
And the other thing very often is different.

163
00:29:36,439 --> 00:29:38,200
I don't like the given students.

164
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:50,360
Don't know, you can't know a thing like that because he's a specialist.

165
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:52,279
What do you not have?

166
00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:17,480
Don't know anything anymore except I don't have to get to let's put it back into one and saying, first of all, it says just before the Japanese NASA slash turns out to race the basic what you think.

167
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:27,079
Yeah, this is the only existing interest.

168
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,400
Okay.

169
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:44,399
I think that't ask collected I think it's in funny sense irrelevant, but I have to tell you why.

170
00:31:46,399 --> 00:32:02,319
So I just don't want samples which are since looking for exactly what it is.

171
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,680
You excuse me, that's not exactly the best.

172
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,200
Well, I don't think you're all following a race here.

173
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,639
You just gotta follow it.

174
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,240
Then she's yours in grief.

175
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:22,479
And remember, when you're in goodness, you're bound to sound like the value residential.

176
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,720
Even the sins that you're bound to say, my world instruction.

177
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:32,439
And when you say that there are a lot of people who are no love somebody's here, he says, I don't want to allow everybody to touch me.

178
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:47,559
Now that certainly is what a French woman says, and she says, your lover does not die.

179
00:32:47,879 --> 00:32:49,959
You're bound to that's what grief is.

180
00:32:49,959 --> 00:32:52,199
You're bound to say this is the end of the world.

181
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,640
I've lost my identity.

182
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,760
I've lost my world.

183
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,999
I didn't believe I would give it.

184
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,160
But that's the same one.

185
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:06,760
But the question is, how will what holistic in the face of doing stuff?

186
00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:10,600
He should go into the internet.

187
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,600
We're going to divide all of us in our lives.

188
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:25,720
There's at least one thing that can stop it.

189
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,680
And it shouldn't.

190
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:34,600
It's as we know that it's just one.

191
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,399
So she doesn't get out of space.

192
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,039
What the fuck is wrong?

193
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,479
Is that what you're worth doing if it's her job?

194
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,920
In common, never friendly.

195
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:57,000
You see any clue there about it, truck doesn't have a resignation.

196
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,519
The world is a spirit.

197
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:10,240
Things all just kind of like the editing isn't possible.

198
00:34:11,319 --> 00:34:18,479
All fal comedy was a comedy when Dante writes it, because comedy finally has been learned.

199
00:34:25,999 --> 00:34:43,600
Why does it feel bad about this going to be something else that you have to get off a lower ethical for a higher ethical speaking?

200
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:45,439
It's obvious.

201
00:34:45,439 --> 00:34:48,079
He's going to go through and suffer.

202
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,640
That's the way that he's going to get it out of the way.

203
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:55,439
I'll stop himself.

204
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:02,399
But that's the kind of person who is.

205
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:08,080
You can't get them studying forever.

206
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:19,840
Even the way he talks about the user that he is already beginning to zoom in the imperial studios.

207
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:30,000
But then the way he damages, he will be already somebody on because he will have to come hard and he will stare by when he's open to somebody else.

208
00:35:29,999 --> 00:35:33,760
So what he said were saying this here linguists.

209
00:35:42,879 --> 00:35:53,440
Well there is damily, which then discovered that he isn't, and then in the end discoveries in the earth, you can't improve anything except the following, I think.

210
00:35:53,439 --> 00:36:01,640
That he is able to accept the fact that he gives and then it is all way down as a fine log.

211
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,640
And you can see that because what happens if he grows.

212
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:18,840
Remember, the first time, for reasons I don't understand, just because he's so insuring that he made one of their spiritually sensitive dragons.

213
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,840
He said himself.

214
00:36:20,919 --> 00:36:23,239
He's accepted it.

215
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,479
And he grows it up.

216
00:36:26,279 --> 00:36:30,439
Let's kind of get accepted.

217
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:32,279
How he markets it all down.

218
00:36:32,279 --> 00:36:37,879
The first time he does throw the gross, and the second time he recognizes it.

219
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:45,799
Yeah, but why don't we see that he never gets because wonderful things because you have to understand the whole word of dirt.

220
00:36:47,879 --> 00:36:54,439
All the people, maybe most essentially, at least understands enough dirty to know what's going on.

221
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,640
Not him.

222
00:36:55,959 --> 00:36:59,160
Okay, I'm going to find that this is something he's got fresh.

223
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:02,119
He's in the house.

224
00:37:02,919 --> 00:37:04,120
Make surprise like that.

225
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,399
Now I'm seeing something.

226
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,160
Unless I have any questions over there.

227
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:15,719
I'll get down here and check out for us.

228
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:41,240
Okay.

229
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:46,799
We're we're looking for all that.

230
00:37:49,279 --> 00:37:51,680
Now you have to show this all the time.

231
00:38:06,799 --> 00:38:08,240
Now, you can see it.

232
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:23,439
Ooh, but just keep it standard.

233
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,120
That is what?

234
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:23,359
Well, you guys always have to talk.

235
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:26,079
I've asked for and better than that.

236
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:28,519
He's got a yellow inside person.

237
00:39:26,879 --> 00:39:30,999
He's going by the time that he serves to you in silence.

238
00:39:31,959 --> 00:39:37,640
Now that the better thing is it makes him a best, the best thing.

239
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,560
He's a very sad fairy.

240
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,120
And he doesn't even.

241
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:50,440
He needs being drawassed.

242
00:39:50,439 --> 00:39:51,799
He's got his own.

243
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:56,200
He thinks that he can just act on his own views the right one.

244
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:02,840
Without it, because he's got the police and the forts and everything else.

245
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:06,279
And we will have to go into this view.

246
00:40:06,439 --> 00:40:15,079
He's getting out to be very big before.

247
00:40:18,439 --> 00:40:31,319
So if we go first through PowerWave, he's getting sent to the name of Select and Power.

248
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:36,600
I don't care about the letters.

249
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,839
I have quitted.

250
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,159
I got different shoes in line.

251
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,640
Another student is a good one.

252
00:40:43,799 --> 00:40:46,279
They didn't fight by a half-hour season.

253
00:40:46,279 --> 00:40:48,919
And then why is he called Harry Lynn?

254
00:40:49,160 --> 00:41:01,720
Well, I'm going to say four men were lawyers trying to make humans for his fears killing the king's marriage for wife.

255
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,599
But he wants to not go with all the results.

256
00:41:05,399 --> 00:41:11,079
Oh, I'm a soul who helping some mountains reading.

257
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,160
Oh, I's not a lion of soul that struggles to be free.

258
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:19,999
I'm sure it's a lot of students at first, but they have to respond to the morning.

259
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:32,879
I think you could certainly hear that line when you see the fingers coming out of the graveyard and they prepare a lot and stuck in the spot, so to speak, and not able to get out of it.

260
00:41:32,879 --> 00:41:38,240
In a way, you can really hear the stand over something.

261
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,720
You don't understand what to do, doesn't it?

262
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:48,719
But so, anyway, there he is.

263
00:41:52,959 --> 00:41:55,680
But what is the right thing for a style?

264
00:41:57,919 --> 00:42:02,240
I would say hello with you, he does things for a status quo.

265
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:07,600
Now, he doesn't believe that he wants to get the knowledge.

266
00:42:09,439 --> 00:42:13,040
What he's not really callous, he's perceptive.

267
00:42:13,279 --> 00:42:26,720
That is, he goes about things in a apparently hard people, or it's not safe to do something the way we do.

268
00:42:27,279 --> 00:42:29,919
You're overfed, you know, apparently possible.

269
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:39,760
And that's because he is a perfect and he knows that he puts the bacteria.

270
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,559
His job is to know how to try as he's drugs.

271
00:42:42,799 --> 00:42:45,039
I'm not going to be open to it.

272
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,999
He says he thought it's going to have to keep people from getting hurt.

273
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,600
He gives miracles of view.

274
00:42:52,279 --> 00:43:02,600
Stop a beauty, but he's nothing really you can see easily on this.

275
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:21,560
Because when the extent of the vaccine stays on his face, I'm not going to talk about his parents, you know, you know.

276
00:43:23,799 --> 00:43:28,519
But what what can I say is just to show that he's ways of pointing.

277
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:51,960
Well, if my own gets dropped, how they're going to get to do his own work is terribly greedy, he's prepping people season so much that he suggests that his dad is all I can see and get all left off with this.

278
00:43:51,959 --> 00:43:59,079
What is one that does all the passage?

279
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,839
I'm not going to have any details.

280
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:06,439
Does where he finds a studio, or is he so lonely that he only wants to be shot because he knows his stuff anyway?

281
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,240
Is that shit?

282
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:12,999
I didn't know his nation is now Zor and knocked out, but that's his love.

283
00:44:12,999 --> 00:44:21,080
For all the people, badly, just go.

284
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,359
But instead of fifty-three, they have to survive every child.

285
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,319
And so we have a modest exit.

286
00:44:29,319 --> 00:44:34,040
He wants he isn't the kind of hero promoting justice everywhere.

287
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:38,040
He's very fifty people don't get it hurt.

288
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:49,519
Um maybe he's like a transitorial of the sense that he's has to just give up his devotion to his friend's terminus to go after higher 80s.

289
00:44:51,120 --> 00:45:07,520
But if I think he's done and there's every way of trying to just do this job.

290
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:12,159
But let me not be enough that here we have offices.

291
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:21,760
Let's see if I can.

292
00:45:27,839 --> 00:46:28,200
People know how to sell branches and completely personally doing any sense of evil and they all went to exactly how to do that as a certainty such as extremely burdens, but that is the okay so now we're talking about hopefully selling.

293
00:46:28,279 --> 00:46:29,959
So we have to talk.

294
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,200
She won't come in credit.

295
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:35,479
But you ask yourself, where is it?

296
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,799
And you see the hard thing it is.

297
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:41,560
It's an example of the kind of thing I was talking about in my first lecture.

298
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:46,439
You're involved in this with intelligence women.

299
00:46:46,439 --> 00:47:01,960
With when would you protect a mass murderer and love, or bring the terrorist that husbands were totally to justice, even though he would get the far watching when your lovers were shot by you?

300
00:47:02,439 --> 00:47:04,839
That a few thoughts and we use that.

301
00:47:04,999 --> 00:47:09,799
Even that person said that they were extremely wrong.

302
00:47:09,799 --> 00:47:21,959
And you can't really use the perspective that were lost in the ships.

303
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:36,920
Even though I was certainly not the person who seems honestly hitting me, he used to have to further.

304
00:47:36,919 --> 00:47:46,839
So, I don't know what the sound law went to say would have not ever honest person they were getting to down to this.

305
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,160
They were strict justice.

306
00:47:51,160 --> 00:48:02,319
Well, okay, I don't see those that it says that have good practice.

307
00:48:00,999 --> 00:48:06,200
Did it's his hardest to accept that it's a murderer and should have gone to skill or control.

308
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:14,480
You get to train the person who was the killer or helpful.

309
00:48:14,479 --> 00:48:14,959
Okay.

310
00:48:11,879 --> 00:48:17,359
And I you sort of aren't going to want to do it.

311
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,319
Um, look, good, you know, they're my guys.

312
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:21,920
I wasn't a sick room.

313
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:31,760
But if you're not altered, there's just no that's what is marvelous.

314
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,840
That's why the movie is so terrific.

315
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,279
So let's go on now.

316
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:45,680
Uh it will stow that letting the secular people get out into the religious people.

317
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:52,319
And therefore the movie ought to sort of redress the movie does.

318
00:48:52,399 --> 00:48:54,399
It doesn't really do it.

319
00:48:54,479 --> 00:48:55,440
Who does it?

320
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:02,079
Who makes up a speech on the spot to make sure that there is a literal scope of what it is, you know, or something?

321
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:19,840
Well, but doesn't this be from the message that is thirty years before the state was warm, murdered with what produced my health as well, you're not getting into as many science because they did just relentlessly.

322
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:27,040
In Switzerland, there was relatively uh alternative use of democracy to use produced.

323
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:27,680
That's true.

324
00:49:28,959 --> 00:49:34,959
So that's supposed to be a press historical institution.

325
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:40,399
Google didn't track there's no answer.

326
00:49:40,479 --> 00:49:42,640
It's simple.

327
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:47,640
The way the movie is set up, so that it's not having figure out and down.

328
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:51,200
They're vertical or the horizontal and always off, which is all off the law.

329
00:49:52,399 --> 00:49:57,720
I want to talk to people off everyone multiple times.

330
00:49:55,279 --> 00:50:00,439
But that's that would be too good to be true.

331
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:05,240
Take in general, the phones is not a figure.

332
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:25,559
And now we're going to compare the noise.

333
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:57,160
It comes in just because I think it says to say it's on the next phase of the design.

334
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,720
He's definitely upset again.

335
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:02,760
Doesn't want five sixteen.

336
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,960
You're a fool.

337
00:51:04,279 --> 00:51:07,960
All that is just your evidence.

338
00:51:07,959 --> 00:51:18,600
Using the double hands, but these bottles are not easy to get into this really difficult.

339
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,600
What in the world is wrong with me?

340
00:51:28,359 --> 00:51:32,959
You will have to fool with my hotel.

341
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:40,999
He says, uh, Tell me where the line is lower in front of that box.

342
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,519
I don't know.

343
00:52:00,799 --> 00:52:01,039
Why?

344
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:11,120
Because of all the thinking as people turn their hair and say first students what we cause today to practical as we look at it.

345
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,319
And now we have something.

346
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,720
That's why it has to be cool.

347
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,319
One.

348
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,519
The best way to see assets is for us.

349
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:34,080
And we're having used to be involved in thinking about what's going on.

350
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:38,079
Dr.

351
00:52:38,399 --> 00:52:42,799
Manchester is hard to talk to be a professional policeman.

352
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:44,240
These people can be heard.

353
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,999
You have to sit the bottom of every day.

354
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:54,960
You have to have to do this get you asked because it's not the other thing.

355
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,839
I am the sheriff of Senator Fair.

356
00:52:57,919 --> 00:53:00,959
I'm into this correct old clean things up.

357
00:53:00,959 --> 00:53:04,479
The only thing I said cool is the best there.

358
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,359
All I have to do is stay together in distress.

359
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:09,840
We'll all have things together.

360
00:53:09,919 --> 00:53:13,680
But he excited movies.

361
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,079
The interesting people have granddams.

362
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:18,879
I'm the student.

363
00:53:18,879 --> 00:53:20,480
I'm glad they are the skinned the standard.

364
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,279
What even wanted to see them advancing his hands?

365
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,799
Now it's burned, but we'll never have said it.

366
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:29,799
Holland turned out to be even worse than Harry.

367
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:33,959
Harry was a murderer, but Holland was a betrayer.

368
00:53:54,280 --> 00:54:01,239
So you get propulsion reversal of your ordinary expansion if you get his waterfall.

369
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:18,039
Ollie stands there, lights a cigarette for time, steps in the field on a wall on his side.

370
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,159
He is also standing just closer and closer.

371
00:54:21,159 --> 00:54:24,999
The music breaks in the context, so he steps for his turn.

372
00:54:24,999 --> 00:54:28,439
Walk right back as if he wasn't easy.

373
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:32,680
He doesn't even want him, and he hasn't clue why.

374
00:54:32,999 --> 00:54:34,839
He's understood nothing.

375
00:54:34,999 --> 00:54:38,519
That's the way his cigarette is total.

376
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:44,839
And the broadband or good luck for the exams included an offer.

377
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:55,559
In spite of the insight around, he watched a very deep movie.

378
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,760
But I think it's just not different.

379
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:49,839
I think we're basically remotely talking about it.
