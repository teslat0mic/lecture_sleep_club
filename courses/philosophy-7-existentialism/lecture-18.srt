1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,759
The mysterious visitor has gotten away with murder, become completely isolated, can't be intimate with anybody.

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,919
That's the existentialized version of being in hell.

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,119
And after 14, or I think it is, years of it, he feels he has to confess.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,679
That's the existentialized version of confession.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,559
Turn it up.

6
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:23,759
Well, it's I tried, but I'm getting this kind of feedback.

7
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:26,239
Let me see if I can do something with it.

8
00:00:32,319 --> 00:00:35,679
I think I can solve this by getting it up closer to my mouth.

9
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:36,160
How's that?

10
00:00:37,319 --> 00:00:38,999
Better for this, too, I think.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:01:09,079
Okay, so now, and then somebody asked me the very good question based on the fact that he makes a public declaration to all his colleagues and his family, and that's supposed to put him in the relation to them that they really know who he is, so that he can at least relate to them honestly, which means as a murderer, it's not a very good relationship, but at least he relates to them, and they aren't relating to some imagined nice guy.

12
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:18,039
But he's become such a nice guy over the years, suffering for what he did and regretting it, that nobody believes him.

13
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:23,639
And they think he's a good man and a loving father, not a murderer.

14
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,759
And so what's going to happen then?

15
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:43,079
Well, I think his confession is nonetheless valid existentially because he has honestly told them who he was, and they have, so to speak, reacted by telling him that he's not that person anymore.

16
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,679
It's exactly like the death row issues.

17
00:01:46,679 --> 00:02:00,359
When somebody's been on death row for 20 years, I don't remember the name of that person about four months ago, was it now or something, who's become a Christian, who does good deeds, who terribly regrets whatever it was they did.

18
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:06,440
And do you kill that person now for what they did 20 years ago?

19
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,919
Or do you not because of what they've become?

20
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,919
It's a big dilemma.

21
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:19,720
And Dostoevsky's taking a side on this dilemma, which is, I guess, the Christian side, namely, you can be reborn, and this guy is reborn.

22
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:27,840
He's now a loving person who wants to be in touch with everybody, not an isolated criminal.

23
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,239
So the fact that they don't believe him doesn't really matter.

24
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,720
The current Michael is not the man who murdered the mistress.

25
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,280
He wouldn't harm anyone now.

26
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:45,840
And so, therefore, having made the confession, yeah, go ahead.

27
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,079
He also had to use like seconds away from killing.

28
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,599
That's right.

29
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,160
And that's interesting.

30
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,599
But he didn't.

31
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,919
And he was tempted.

32
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:10,160
It's so painful to have to confess to your family and your colleagues that you're a murderer that he almost murdered Zosima rather than confess it.

33
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:19,039
That would have been certainly to throw him back into hell and to confirm existentially that he was still a bad person.

34
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,639
But he didn't do it.

35
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,240
And I think that's supposed to show that in the end he wouldn't hurt anybody anymore.

36
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,400
You don't look convinced.

37
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:30,320
That's all right?

38
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:30,960
Okay.

39
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:31,840
Yeah.

40
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,359
Yeah.

41
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,320
He was wanting to murder.

42
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,599
He had the desire.

43
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,200
Well, it's interesting.

44
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:50,880
I think while he was having the real desire to kill him, his heart was dark and he was still a criminal.

45
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,759
But now what's in his heart is he's glad he didn't.

46
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:04,960
And so the man now, standing before everybody and confessing, is getting what he deserves, so to speak, back in touch with everybody.

47
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,680
And in effect, existentially, this is Dostoevsky's story.

48
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:14,679
You don't have to buy it, but what the book wants you to believe is that he is in heaven.

49
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:25,319
That is, at this, having done this, he goes, he gets into, why is this not what I expected?

50
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,679
Hmm.

51
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,320
No, that's because I'm looking at the wrong quote.

52
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:32,999
Okay, on 301.

53
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,599
He always puts it in traditional Christian terms.

54
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:45,879
This is a kind of trick of Dostoevsky because he wants you to both see what he's existentialized.

55
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:53,880
He wants you to see the existentialized experience, but he wants you to see what he's existentialized.

56
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,840
So somebody always describes it in the pre-existentialized language.

57
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:18,359
And so here, Michael at the bottom of 301, just as he described hell in the pre- and falling into the hands of a living God, both of which Dostoevsky thinks really happened to people, but they don't happen to people in some supernatural way, but in some what he calls psychological, and I'm calling existential way.

58
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:21,239
So he's in heaven at the bottom of 301.

59
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:24,200
He says, God has pity on me and is calling me to him.

60
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,439
I know I'm dying, but I feel joy and peace for the first time after so many years.

61
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:32,039
There's been heaven in my heart from the moment I did what I had to do.

62
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:35,479
Now I dare to love my children and to kiss them.

63
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:42,759
So he's now dying, a happy, fulfilled, blissful person.

64
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,200
But there's, and that's fine.

65
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,999
And it's interesting that the mysterious visitor has a reciprocal effect on Sosthamus.

66
00:05:51,200 --> 00:06:00,400
Just as Zosima, by throwing away his gun at the duel, inspired the mysterious visitor to confess.

67
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,999
The confession of the mysterious visitor had an effect on Zosima.

68
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,919
This is on 349.

69
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,999
Looking at where I think it is.

70
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,080
Oh, again, I'm getting confused.

71
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,679
It's on 302.

72
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:19,199
I'll learn to read before the end of the lecture, I promise.

73
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,440
Here we are: 302 at the bottom.

74
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:31,200
Zosima ends this by saying, But I held my tongue, and very shortly, that is the telling that he really was a murderer, since it doesn't matter anymore.

75
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,840
I held my tongue, and very shortly after, I left the town.

76
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:42,320
And five months later, by God's grace, I entered upon the safe and blessed path, following the unseen finger that had guided me so clearly to it.

77
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,400
But I remember in my prayer to this day the servant of God, Michael, who suffered so greatly.

78
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,799
Now, for years, that passage puzzled me.

79
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:54,799
It ought to puzzle you, too.

80
00:06:54,799 --> 00:07:05,120
I mean, I thought the unseen finger was a sort of metaphorical way of referring to the fact that the mysterious visitor sort of pointed him his way to the monastery.

81
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:17,360
That's not right, because the translation says, and they all do, so I'm sure that it's the right thing to say, that he went into the monastery, guided by the unseen finger.

82
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,799
But I remember in my prayer to this day, not and, I mean, there are two things going on.

83
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:37,480
He goes to the monastery, already guided by the unseen finger, and Michael, in effect, confirms him in it, just the way he confirms Michael, and who had already decided he ought to confess into confessing, I take it.

84
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:39,799
But that leaves the puzzle, doesn't it?

85
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:41,720
What about this unseen finger?

86
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:47,000
There's a movie where there's this person always in the background watching out over the other guys.

87
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,560
A sequel to The Sundance Kid, I think.

88
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:51,160
You know what I mean?

89
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:56,039
That finally it turns out to be this woman who's protecting him all the time.

90
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:57,480
What movie is that?

91
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,200
What?

92
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,280
The Sting, exactly.

93
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,959
It's like the Sting.

94
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:04,359
There's somebody in the background.

95
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:14,840
You'll hear about them again a little while in this lecture who is guiding people around and literally guiding them around and pointing directions and influencing their life.

96
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,039
And you haven't seen them yet and you don't know who they are.

97
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,360
And this is the first hint of this.

98
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:23,640
And you won't know for a while who they are.

99
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,799
But I want to say one more thing, and then that's the end of what was supposed to be the lecture last time.

100
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:31,560
And we go on to a new issue.

101
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:33,080
But there's one more thing.

102
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:47,720
It's interesting that once he goes into the monastery and takes what he calls the safe path, there's an implication already that there's something wrong with him, that he feels responsible for everybody, but he doesn't do anything.

103
00:08:47,719 --> 00:08:49,320
And he doesn't do anything.

104
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:54,600
He doesn't perform, Zosima, that is, any more miracles in the course of the book.

105
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,240
I mean, he saves the mysterious visitor.

106
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:04,520
I mean, let's not call it a miracle, but he doesn't perform any existential good deeds, so to speak, from then on.

107
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:11,000
He still is a great elder, and he has confessions, and he tries to, and he bows down to Dimitri.

108
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,360
He still knows that he understands love like a science, but he doesn't do, he doesn't make any difference in the world.

109
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:24,880
And on the other hand, Alyosha never does any good deeds until he leaves the monastery.

110
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:29,440
As somebody pointed out to me, but I just realized now I didn't have time to look it up.

111
00:09:29,439 --> 00:09:39,840
Alyasha's attempted good deed, when he tries to give money to this guy, I forget who, just leads to the guy having a sort of fit and throwing down the money and trampling on it.

112
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,199
I didn't go back and look it up, but it was a very unsuccessful good deed.

113
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:44,640
Were you the one who told me about it?

114
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,760
What page?

115
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,880
206, 207.

116
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,000
Just, I mean, I think it's no coincidence.

117
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,280
Dostoevsky knows perfectly what he's doing.

118
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,120
And now wear on 206.

119
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,600
Okay.

120
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:05,839
Okay, why look, squealed the captain suddenly, and showing him the two notes which he'd been holding in one corner between his fingers and so forth.

121
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,000
He crumpled them, seized them tight.

122
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,440
Do you see he shrieked pale and infuriated and fling up his hand?

123
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:12,880
He threw the crumpled notes on the sand.

124
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,240
You see he shrieked again?

125
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,360
Look there.

126
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:22,480
And that's Alyasha's only attempted helping somebody before he leaves the monastery.

127
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:27,120
We'll see that he performs all sorts of interesting things once he does.

128
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,080
In fact, that's the subject for today's lecture.

129
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:41,039
So from now on, we're looking for the next existentialized something or other, sacrament, I've been calling him big deal Christian symbols.

130
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:53,520
And the most interesting, the most important, because Dostoevsky manages to make every possible relevant move at once and brings it off, I think, brilliantly.

131
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,360
And thus, what is the existentialized miracle?

132
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:05,840
Remember, that's the toughest hurdle for Dostoevsky, because a miracle, in principle, ought to just be against the laws of physics and chemistry.

133
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:08,439
I mean, I suppose you've heard things like this.

134
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:13,640
Every once in a while, people try to explain away a miracle by the laws of physics and chemistry.

135
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:25,799
I once heard, I don't know if this is still a popular view, that the Red Sea has a sandbar in it, and when the wind blows a certain way, you can walk across the sea, and that's what Moses and the Jews did.

136
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:29,160
But then the wind changed, and that sunk all the Pharaoh and his people.

137
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,559
It was just a kind of meteorological fluke.

138
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:38,039
Well, that's not a miracle, that's what a miracle looks like.

139
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:40,999
It's got to be, I mean, that's not what a miracle looks like.

140
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,920
I mean, it's got to be some intervention from outside the natural order to be a miracle, one would think.

141
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:57,799
And Dostoevsky is in a tough mind here if he wants to existentialize miracles and make sure that they don't go against the laws of physics and chemistry.

142
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:01,719
Because one of the points of the book, I mean, I've never said this, it's so obvious to me.

143
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:02,920
Have I said it already?

144
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,440
That he's, I think I must have.

145
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:16,039
He's trying to save Christianity by not letting it run head up against science because he knows that we're becoming a secular culture, and if you try to do that, science is going to win.

146
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:25,719
So his whole project when he existentializes the Christian symbols is to not run up against the laws of physics and chemistry.

147
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:36,600
After all, confession turned out to be a kind of religious spiritual event, but it didn't go against the laws of physics and chemistry.

148
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,319
But now, how's he going to do it with the miracle?

149
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:41,160
That's the interesting thing.

150
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:45,320
Well, the first question, we have to do it step by step.

151
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,200
All of this is going to go back to the Grand Inquisitor story, don't forget.

152
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:57,440
The issue in the Grand Inquisitor story we're now asking ourselves is: one, do people need miracles?

153
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:01,280
Remember, Jesus figure says no, they don't need miracles.

154
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,879
That coerces them to believe, but they really ought to believe freely.

155
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,319
And then if they get miracles as a kind of bonus, that's all right.

156
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,959
But you don't need miracles to believe.

157
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,240
In fact, if you have miracles and believe because of them, that's the wrong kind of belief.

158
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,600
But the Grand Inquisitor says, but people do need miracles.

159
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:32,000
And so the church, that the Grand Inquisitor represents, makes up miracles in order to keep people believing.

160
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,039
So the issue is: do people need miracles in order to keep their faith?

161
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,720
And the Grand Inquisitor says yes, and we'll make them.

162
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:43,919
And the Jesus figure says no, and I won't do it.

163
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:51,440
I won't jump off the temple and get held up by angels, because that's not the way to get people.

164
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,639
That's not what I want people.

165
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,039
That's not how I want people to believe in me.

166
00:13:55,039 --> 00:14:00,080
So the issue then becomes: can people live without miracles?

167
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,080
I see something here.

168
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,240
I want to fix something.

169
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,440
I think on 248.3.

170
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:16,960
248, I mean, 248, but I'm not sure because I can't read what he's written.

171
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,199
So let's hope.

172
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,120
Oh, yeah, that's a very important quote.

173
00:14:24,319 --> 00:14:36,080
So 248, about two-thirds of the way down, or three-quarters of the way down, the Grand Inquisitor says, is the nature of men such that they can reject miracles?

174
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:45,960
And at the great moments of their life, the moments of their deepest and most agonizing spiritual difficulties, cling only to the free verdict of the heart.

175
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:49,320
Now, you've done the reading for this, those who have.

176
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:50,840
Can they?

177
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,600
Do you remember what's happening?

178
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,480
I just want to see how many.

179
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,800
Dostoevsky is so oblite.

180
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:04,120
He's so, he never lets you know what's happening so head-on, and yet he's also so anxious to make sure you get it.

181
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,039
Do people need miracles in order to keep their faith?

182
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,720
Anybody know?

183
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:14,520
Does Alyasha need a miracle in order to keep his faith?

184
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,840
Nobody has an opinion?

185
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:17,719
This is scary.

186
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,680
I can hear you.

187
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,120
You don't think so?

188
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,600
Okay.

189
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,360
Well, let's look and see.

190
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:32,200
So we're going to look at this now and find out whether Alyasha needs a miracle to keep the faith.

191
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:36,920
But it turns on the death and decomposition of Zosima.

192
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:39,080
And so now we have to look at that.

193
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:40,679
There's so many issues now.

194
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,200
If I lose you, raise your hands and scream.

195
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:45,800
I'll try to be clear and slow.

196
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,999
But Dostoevsky does about, I don't know, 10 things at once at this point.

197
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:54,439
And it's very hard to keep them all going at once.

198
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:59,479
But they're all very clear.

199
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:10,120
And at the bottom of 325, we will see, in the middle of that bottom paragraph, Alyasha thought of that sorrowful day as one of the most bitter and fatal days of his life.

200
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,999
This is, Father Zosima is now stinking, as Rakitan says.

201
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:27,279
If the question is asked, could all his grief and disturbance have been due to the fact that his elder's body had shown signs of premature decomposition instead of performing miracles, I must answer, yes, it certainly was.

202
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,679
Well, now I ask you again: does Alyacha need a miracle to keep his faith?

203
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:34,239
Yes, he needs a miracle to keep his faith.

204
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:36,719
It gets clearer as we go on.

205
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:50,640
But before we go on, we better get, I have to say something about the bad odor of Zosima.

206
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,600
There is three possibilities that Dostoevsky sort of toys with.

207
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:00,719
There's the, you could have a natural explanation of the smell.

208
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:08,640
It could be a positive miracle showing that somehow, I don't have it to be a positive.

209
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,720
I guess they wanted a positive miracle.

210
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:13,039
They wanted him not to decompose.

211
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,600
Or this could be a negative miracle.

212
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,160
He's decomposing faster than he should.

213
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:29,600
And it shows that his bad moves, like eating pineapple compote and having group therapy sessions, is being condemned by God.

214
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,679
All these issues are in the air.

215
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:38,880
So I want to just make clear, partly because the interpreters I've read get this all wrong.

216
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:51,519
Later in the book, there's another corpse that is smelling totally sweet, even though it was past time for it to start smelling decomposing.

217
00:17:51,519 --> 00:18:03,840
And now, and the contrast, people think, must be that Dostoevsky wants us to see that there's something wrong with Zosima and something right about this way at the end of the book, dead boy.

218
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,280
But I think that's clearly wrong.

219
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:09,959
And sooner or later, I have to talk about it, so I'm going to talk about it now.

220
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:18,519
In the middle of 318, he's talking about it.

221
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:28,199
This is, or afterwards, even many years afterwards, some sensible monks were amazed and horrified, as they recall that day.

222
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,319
They skipping a little God-fearing men and so forth.

223
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:43,959
Yet from their humble coffins, too, other people who died, other elders, the breath of corruption had come, naturally, as from all dead bodies.

224
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,600
That it caused not the slightest excitement and so forth.

225
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:59,959
In other words, you could have taken this naturally, but okay, let's stop with that.

226
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:05,400
And then on 318, looking, well, then there have been positive miracles.

227
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,080
Then he goes on, right where I'm reading.

228
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:14,919
Of course, there had been in former times saints in the monastery whose memory was carefully preserved and whose relics, according to tradition, showed no signs of corruption.

229
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:24,199
This fact was regarded by the monks as mysterious, and the tradition of it was cherished as something blessed and miraculous, as a promise by God's grace.

230
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:27,400
That's the kind of against physics and chemistry miracle.

231
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:38,840
Dostoevsky's not going to tell you the story of how some normal dead body was left undecomposing.

232
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:48,919
And then there are the ones who think that the smell showed that there was some intervention of God against Osama at the middle of 319.

233
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:58,079
That, I believe, was the reason why many people were pleased at the smell of decomposition, which came so quickly, or not a day had passed since his death.

234
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:05,120
They were pleased because it showed that he decomposed too fast.

235
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,120
On 327.

236
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:17,839
Really?

237
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:19,840
Oh, yeah, oh, I see.

238
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,640
Yeah, okay.

239
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:23,439
About 15 lines down.

240
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:30,719
Even had there been no miracles, had there been nothing miraculous to justify his hopes, this is Alyasha thinking.

241
00:20:30,719 --> 00:20:32,000
Why this indignity?

242
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:33,519
Why this humiliation?

243
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:38,719
Why this premature decay in excess of nature, as the spiteful monks said?

244
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:41,039
That would be a negative miracle.

245
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:49,439
So the question is then next: did the smell go against physics and chemistry as a kind of negative miracle?

246
00:20:49,439 --> 00:20:57,919
Well, you've got to know, and you've got to ask yourself way later in the book what else happened, what happened with the other corpse.

247
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:08,880
In this case, Dostoevsky sets it up to make sure that you know, if you're paying attention, that this was all perfectly natural and within the laws of physics and chemistry.

248
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,400
The windows were closed.

249
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,280
I'm just going to give you a list of that together show, of course, the corpse should smell.

250
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:18,640
The windows were closed at the bottom of 317.

251
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:26,560
The question of opening the windows was raised among those who were around the coffin, but this suggestion was unanswered and went almost unnoticed.

252
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,319
Okay, that's the first thing.

253
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:35,599
Now, the reason it was suggested that they might open the windows but didn't is because it was a warm autumn night.

254
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:42,760
We're told that every once in a while, but for us, let's just look at this time.

255
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,599
I really take my word for it, it's a warm autumn night.

256
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:56,199
More important, and take my word for it too, since you won't be getting a notice of it, there were no flowers.

257
00:21:56,199 --> 00:22:11,560
See, I'm setting it up, this is no big secret, that at the next dead body, the windows are open, it's the middle of winter, there are lots of flowers, and finally, that body, the one you're going to get to later, was washed.

258
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:17,720
Whereas we go out of the way on 3:15 to learn that the bodies of dead monks and hermits are not washed.

259
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:20,599
Third line of the chapter.

260
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:23,800
So, naturally, it smells bad in the room.

261
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:33,400
Windows closed, no flowers, hot autumn night, and unwashed corpse, and it's just straight fine with the laws of physics and chemistry.

262
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,759
So, what did Alyasha want?

263
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:45,719
Well, he wanted some kind of supernatural miracle that made Dazasima's body not decompose.

264
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:48,360
And that's what he's not getting.

265
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:54,599
And when he's not getting it, he's falling into, he's losing his faith.

266
00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:01,239
This is on 317, about in that big paragraph about halfway down.

267
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,759
The narrator appears.

268
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,160
You know, I say this narrator comes and goes.

269
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:17,959
This narrator says, I personally feel it almost repulsive to recall that event which caused such excitement and was such a stumbling block to so many, though in reality it was the most natural thing.

270
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:24,400
I've said that this narrator is not very smart, so I can't take much pride in the fact that Olmos Casey's on my side.

271
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:35,120
I would, of course, have admitted all mention of it in my story if it had not exerted a very strong influence on the heart and soul of the chief, though future hero of my story, Alyasha.

272
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:45,360
It brought a crisis and turning point to his spiritual development, giving a shock to his intellect, which finally strengthened it for the rest of his life and gave it a definite aim.

273
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,120
Okay, so there we go.

274
00:23:49,120 --> 00:24:01,360
It turns out to be a very important experience for Alyasha because it's an experience where he almost loses his faith, but doesn't for reasons that are very interesting and complicated.

275
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:09,839
Now, the next thing is to understand why Alyasha is going into such a fit about this situation.

276
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:16,640
Well, that should be obvious to all of you already, but I think I have to just put it into got all the points.

277
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,640
I mean, he's got all his love wrapped up in Zosima.

278
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:31,600
He's suffering, not all, he's suffering from not, he's suffering from losing the person you love, and then all this humiliation on top of it.

279
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,239
So he has every reason to be very upset.

280
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:40,640
So look on 326, just a little below the middle.

281
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:53,519
The fact is that all the love that lay concealed in his pure young heart for everyone and everything had for the past year been concentrated, and perhaps wrongly so, on one being, his beloved elder.

282
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,919
You might notice a little interesting thing there if you're paying attention.

283
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,959
He's not a Kierkegaardian, Dostoevsky.

284
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:10,279
He is not happy that this was an unconditional, total commitment in which everything that Alyasha cared about was tied up in Zosima.

285
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:17,160
How that could be wrong, and yet Dostoevsky be a Christian, is not yet clear.

286
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:30,279
Dostoevsky would, you can begin to see that Dostoevsky, because Kierkegaard is this Lutheran Protestant, is not going to like anything in Kierkegaard, including unconditional commitments.

287
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:45,640
So tied up in his beloved elder, it's true that his elder had for so long been accepted by him as an ideal that all his young strength and energy could not but turn toward an ideal, even to the forgetting at the moment of everyone and everything.

288
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:51,239
Now, here, if you're reading carefully, is a hint of what's wrong with unconditional commitments.

289
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:52,919
They're too exclusive.

290
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:59,319
If you really get all wrapped up in one person, you forget to love and help a lot of other people.

291
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,040
And that's just what happened to Alyasha going on.

292
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:07,239
He remembered afterwards how on that terrible day he had entirely forgotten his brother Dmitri.

293
00:26:07,239 --> 00:26:12,999
See, who forgets and remembers his brother is very biblical and it's very important.

294
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:19,160
Ivan says at one point he doesn't have, he's not responsible for his brother Dmitri.

295
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,400
Smerzhikov says at one point he's not responsible for Dmitry.

296
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:30,919
Alyasha thinks he is responsible for Dmitry, but he forgets it when he's so upset when Zasima dies.

297
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:38,600
He forgets it, and we see that here, but we see it also on 257.

298
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,799
It's a big deal that he forgets it.

299
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:48,679
The 257 is what he's thinking back to from the passage I read at the end of that section.

300
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:53,919
Several times afterward, Ivonne wondered how he could, on leaving Yvonne.

301
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,079
Oh, no, he forgets, yes, so completely forget his brother Dimitri.

302
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:07,599
He had that morning only a few hours before so firmly resolved to find him and not to give up doing so, even should he be unable to return to the monastery that night.

303
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,120
He resolved to find him and do that, but he didn't do that.

304
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,919
So that's part of the problem.

305
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:20,160
So with the death of Zosima, he's lost the object of his defining commitment.

306
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:25,599
That was just an aside, a defining commitment, which, well, maybe wasn't a good thing to have anyway.

307
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,039
But it was too.

308
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:27,679
You'll see.

309
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,679
Dostievsky's got subtle views.

310
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:35,759
I mean, he isn't saying, he isn't saying he shouldn't have loved Zosima with all his might.

311
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:41,360
He's saying something much more complicated and interesting, which we'll get to.

312
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,999
So Alyasha, so now let's see.

313
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,840
So the loved person has died on 215.

314
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,559
I don't know why I say that, but let's look.

315
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,719
Again, how it looks to Alyasha on the middle of 215.

316
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:05,759
And now, on top of it all, my best friend, he's talking to Lisa, the best man in the world, is going, is leaving the earth.

317
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:08,959
If you knew, Lisa, how bound up in my soul I am with him.

318
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:09,999
That's this sort of thing.

319
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,959
He's got this temporary unconditional commitment.

320
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:14,880
And then I shall be left alone.

321
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,640
I shall come to see you, Lisa.

322
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,559
For the future we will be together.

323
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:24,959
That's the hint, by the way, that they're existential doubles, and that he's going to marry Lisa someday.

324
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,360
But not in this book, but in the other book that never got written.

325
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,360
Okay, now, where are we?

326
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:47,479
And Aliasha says that what he wants is justice, even when he's all upset about it.

327
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:57,319
So on 340, he thinks that Zosima should be appreciated.

328
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,679
Where we are, 340.

329
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,880
Hmm.

330
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,319
That's not it at all.

331
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,160
Okay, I have to fix this.

332
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,559
Then try looking at 3.

333
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,600
Well, that's funny.

334
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,479
330.

335
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,519
Oh, I'm again.

336
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:21,080
I was.

337
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,759
Boy, am I being weird today?

338
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:24,439
It is on 340.

339
00:29:24,439 --> 00:29:24,999
I don't know why.

340
00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:26,919
I was just looking at 341.

341
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,880
Not really.

342
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,840
It's worse than I thought.

343
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,519
Okay, let's look at try again.

344
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:41,880
I don't understand yet what I'm doing, but in a minute I will.

345
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:45,719
Okay.

346
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,479
You collect your wits while I collect my wits.

347
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,160
Let's see.

348
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:04,599
Well, what I say is when I've got to find the place where Alyasha says what he wants is justice.

349
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:06,439
327.

350
00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:11,999
Why am I?

351
00:30:11,999 --> 00:30:12,839
Where do you see that?

352
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,640
Oh, yeah, good.

353
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,520
You're absolutely right.

354
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:16,999
327 at the top of the page.

355
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:18,439
Why haven't I got that?

356
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,719
I don't know.

357
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,120
Nothing to do with what I got.

358
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,559
Okay.

359
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:27,279
So he wants justice.

360
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:37,519
And it's part of the influence of Yvonne that he sees what's happening with Zosima as some reason to reject the world, you'll see in a minute.

361
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:44,880
But he thinks somehow that the world isn't properly set up if Zosima dies.

362
00:30:45,199 --> 00:30:54,479
But let's just go head on into what's important: the way Alyasha is losing his faith over it.

363
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:57,519
Starting at the bottom of 327.

364
00:30:58,719 --> 00:31:03,519
Or really, starting, let's start with 328.

365
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,479
No, let's start at the bottom of 327.

366
00:31:06,479 --> 00:31:10,959
It was dusk.

367
00:31:10,959 --> 00:31:11,599
Well, let's see.

368
00:31:19,199 --> 00:31:21,759
The faith of his soul had been shaken.

369
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:25,519
You see about eight lines from the bottom of 327.

370
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:29,119
I mean, remember, now, he didn't get a miracle.

371
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,360
And moreover, he got what might even be a negative miracle.

372
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,519
And he's losing his faith.

373
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:41,599
And when he's losing his faith, who should appear but the existentialized devil?

374
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,479
You're getting used to that by now, if you're reading carefully.

375
00:31:44,479 --> 00:31:46,640
Who's the existentialized devil?

376
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,679
Rakitin, right, who always says the devil only knows when he talks.

377
00:31:51,679 --> 00:32:02,479
It was dusk at the bottom of 327 when Rakitin, crossing the pine grove from the hermitage to the monastery, suddenly noticed Alyasha lying face downward on the ground under a tree.

378
00:32:02,479 --> 00:32:04,079
He went up and called him.

379
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,360
You hear Alyasha?

380
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:11,160
And then skipping to the middle of the page, can you really be so upset simply because your old man has begun to stink?

381
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:16,120
You don't mean to say you seriously believed he was going to work miracles.

382
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,199
And Alyasha says, I believe, I want to believe, I will believe.

383
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:21,559
What more do you want?

384
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:30,439
And Rakitin says, starting one sentence, and damn it all, why no schoolboy of 13 believes that now.

385
00:32:30,439 --> 00:32:31,239
But there.

386
00:32:31,239 --> 00:32:33,160
So now you're angry with your God.

387
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,400
You're rebelling against him.

388
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,640
And this is the Yvonne rebellion.

389
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:41,240
Everybody influences everybody in the book.

390
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,999
That's one of the themes I keep telling you.

391
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,600
It has more effect on others than they realize, good and bad.

392
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:54,520
And one of the ways this shows up is a kind of plagiarism in which people get sort of taken over by other people's ideas.

393
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,880
Right now, Alyasha is getting taken over by Yvonne.

394
00:32:57,879 --> 00:33:00,359
So he says, I'm not rebelling against my God.

395
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:02,039
I simply don't accept his world.

396
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,080
Alyasha suddenly smiled a forced smile.

397
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:12,199
Well, that's certainly plagiarism from Yvonne, but it's what Alyasha is beginning to believe.

398
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:14,039
So now we need to see where we are.

399
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,919
Let me see.

400
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:37,799
Okay.

401
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:46,279
Now, so when Rakitin sees that Alyasha is losing his faith and rebelling, what does he do?

402
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:53,920
Well, the job of the devil is to help people, help in the sense, to help them despair.

403
00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:12,719
That is, the job of the devil is when people are losing their faith to do everything he can to get them to lose their faith, to make them more miserable and more despairing, and finally to get them to just do something that is unpardonably against their faith.

404
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,640
So it gets to be kind of fun.

405
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:24,160
Rakitin sees this and immediately thinks that he can now sort of seduce Alyasha to do things that he would never have done before.

406
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,560
He sees that he's rebelling, as he says on 328, which we read.

407
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,800
He's a regular rebellion.

408
00:34:30,799 --> 00:34:36,160
And so he tempts him with sausage, vodka, and Grushenka in that order.

409
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:42,640
On 329.1, he says, I got some sausage, the top, I brought it from the town in case of need.

410
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,479
Only you won't eat sausage.

411
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,839
It must be Lent or something.

412
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,319
What happens in August that they wouldn't eat sausage?

413
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:49,199
Does anybody know?

414
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,000
When is Lent?

415
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,279
Not in August.

416
00:34:52,319 --> 00:34:54,320
But it isn't August, autumn.

417
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,199
I don't know.

418
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,679
Anybody know why he's not eating sausage?

419
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:58,880
I don't either.

420
00:34:58,879 --> 00:35:02,240
But anyway, he's not supposed to, and he says, okay.

421
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:03,840
And he says, give me some.

422
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,239
And then he says, but vodka's going too far for you.

423
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:07,759
No, give me some vodka.

424
00:35:07,759 --> 00:35:08,719
That's easy.

425
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:10,560
Then comes the exciting part.

426
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,360
He says, let's go to Grushenka.

427
00:35:14,799 --> 00:35:15,600
Will you come?

428
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,199
asked Rakitin at last.

429
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:20,560
Let's go to Grushenka, Alyasha answered calmly.

430
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:27,600
And then we are told a little further down the very devilish thing about Rakitin.

431
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,039
Why was he doing this?

432
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:40,040
Well, in that bigger paragraph, his object in this case was twofold, of a revengeful desire to see the downfall of the righteous and Alyasha's fall from saint to sinner.

433
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:42,280
That's the typical job of devils.

434
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,640
And in the second case, a material gain for himself.

435
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:51,240
It turns out Grushenka has offered him money if he'll bring Alyasha.

436
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:55,000
But that's important to us as the devilish motivation.

437
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,600
By the way, I've been talking a long time.

438
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:03,320
Is everybody okay with so far and thinks that I'm not doing anything wrong?

439
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:09,719
This is all setting up some big deal thing, which we will, so I'm perfectly happy to keep setting it up.

440
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,439
So Rikitin is just demonic, devilish.

441
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,080
He's doing this gratuitous, evil thing.

442
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,640
And now we switch to Grushenka.

443
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:26,440
Okay, Grushenka is now 22 years old, and we need to know about her past.

444
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:33,000
She was seduced and betrayed by a Polish soldier when she was 17.

445
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:43,400
And then he left, married somebody else, and she became a prostitute, a sort of high-class prostitute, relatively speaking, kept by a rich merchant.

446
00:36:43,399 --> 00:36:47,960
And she and everybody in the town consider her a fallen woman.

447
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:56,360
Then the the Pole's wife dies and he sends a message to Grushenka that now he wants to marry her.

448
00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:02,760
And this is obviously not, well, it it's confusing to Grushenka to say the least.

449
00:37:02,759 --> 00:37:10,679
On the one hand, she's sort of be saved from being kept woman, and she gets the Polish lover.

450
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:22,640
On the other hand, it's pretty insulting that he has married somebody else, and then when that person dies, he just calls in Grushenka as a sort of second the second backup person.

451
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:43,520
And so her alternatives are to go back to him, as she puts it, like a dog, meaning grateful that he's finally got chosen her and saved her from the merchant, or with a knife, revenging herself on him for all that he's done to humiliate and insult and hurt her.

452
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:50,080
So she's in a frenzy over these two possibilities of 341.

453
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,640
The middle, a little below the middle.

454
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:59,840
If he comes and whistles for me, I'll creep back to him like a beaten dog.

455
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:04,559
And then at the bottom of that long paragraph, perhaps I'll take a knife with me today.

456
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,480
I can't make up my mind.

457
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,080
So she's got two destructive alternatives.

458
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,679
If she does either one of these things, sort of it's the end for her.

459
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:20,880
She ends up totally humiliated and a sort of slave married to him, or she ends up murdering him.

460
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:30,000
So, and she has to do something because he's called her, and she wants to go and take advantage of that, but she doesn't know what she wants to do.

461
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,479
So she says, about 15 lines from the bottom of 341: Where am I?

462
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:43,840
Before you came in, I was lying here waiting, brooding, deciding my whole future life, and you never know what was in my heart.

463
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,400
Well, we know what was in my heart because we just read it.

464
00:38:46,399 --> 00:38:54,480
Which way to go back to the old lover, to humiliated like a dog or revengeful with her knife.

465
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:02,240
And then, at that moment, in comes Alyasha and Retitin.

466
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:21,719
And it's important to know that Alyasha is totally lusts for Grushenka, just like Dmitry and just like the old Taramatsov.

467
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:33,320
The only person who isn't totally bowled over by Grushenka is Ivan, who seems to be completely immune to such kinds of sensuality.

468
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:41,639
But you're supposed to think, I told somebody after class last time when I think of it, there was going to be a movie of the brothers, and Marilyn Monroe was going to play Grushenka.

469
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,120
That would have been right if she had a black wig.

470
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,439
I can't think of a blonde Grushenka.

471
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:53,239
But anyway, somebody as sexy and as attractive as a human being at the same time.

472
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:55,400
And that's supposed to be, it would have been perfect.

473
00:39:55,399 --> 00:39:57,560
And so here we are.

474
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:08,199
He is now right next to this woman whom he finds just absolutely, overwhelmingly, physically attractive.

475
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:10,120
And then what happens?

476
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,679
Well, she jumps on his lap.

477
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:13,880
That's what happens.

478
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:15,959
But we have to go back now to see where that is.

479
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,879
Is that 335?

480
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,519
Yeah, on the bottom of 335.

481
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,799
Rakitin says, his elder stinks.

482
00:40:29,799 --> 00:40:30,759
And she says, what?

483
00:40:30,759 --> 00:40:31,959
You are talking nonsense.

484
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,399
You want to say something nasty.

485
00:40:33,399 --> 00:40:34,039
Be quiet.

486
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:34,920
You're stupid.

487
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,640
Let me sit on your knee, Alyasha, like this.

488
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:43,160
She suddenly got up and laughed, nestling like a kitten on his knee with her right arm around his neck.

489
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,400
I'll cheer you up, my pious boy.

490
00:40:45,399 --> 00:40:52,800
Well, now things are getting really scary for Alyasha because he's getting the rebellion he sort of wants.

491
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:59,279
But it doesn't happen at all the way Rakitin thought it would happen, or Alyasha, too.

492
00:40:59,279 --> 00:41:02,879
We have to read: Alyasha at the bottom of 335 didn't speak.

493
00:41:02,879 --> 00:41:04,800
He sat afraid to move.

494
00:41:04,799 --> 00:41:06,240
He heard her words.

495
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:08,960
If you tell me, I'll get off, but he didn't answer.

496
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,080
But there was nothing in his heart, such as Rakitin, for instance, watching him might have expected or thought.

497
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:18,400
The grief in his heart swallowed up every sensation that might have been aroused.

498
00:41:18,399 --> 00:41:26,719
If only he could have thought clearly at that moment, he would have realized that he had now the strongest armor to protect him against every lust and temptation.

499
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,119
And what's happening there?

500
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,600
What's getting existentialized there?

501
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:41,199
Well, it's the fact that he's switched from eros to what Christian, agape.

502
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,400
Eros is the Greek word for desire.

503
00:41:44,399 --> 00:41:49,839
And that's what he had for her.

504
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,760
We'll read more about that in a minute.

505
00:41:51,759 --> 00:42:04,560
Agape is the Greek word that gets translated charity in Paul's faith, when Christians need faith, hope, and charity.

506
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:13,199
But charity has gotten so sort of, I don't know, made into just giving away money or something that now it gets translated love, usually.

507
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:17,199
But there are two kinds of love: there's desiring love, that's eros.

508
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:27,040
Plato says it comes from a lack, and you want something that you need, and you will pursue whatever it is that you're lusting after.

509
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,000
That's eros.

510
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,480
It can be from very low physical level to spiritual kind of desire.

511
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,080
But in this case, it's going to be physical desire.

512
00:42:37,399 --> 00:42:48,920
And agape is Christian love, which is a kind of love that doesn't want anything that is already fulfilled and out to help other people who aren't fulfilled.

513
00:42:48,920 --> 00:43:00,440
So, and it's a condition of some kind of total interestedness in the other person, but not to get anything from them.

514
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,199
And let's go on.

515
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:08,359
At the top of 336, he could not help wondering at a new and strange sensation in his heart.

516
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:09,879
That's agape.

517
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:16,840
This woman, this dreadful woman, had no terror for him now, none of the terror that stirred in him at any passing thought of women.

518
00:43:16,839 --> 00:43:31,480
On the contrary, this woman, dreaded above all women, sitting now on his knee, holding him in her arms, aroused in him now a quite different, unexpected, peculiar feeling, a feeling of the intensest and purest interest without a trace of fear.

519
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,160
That's agape.

520
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:45,000
But the other translation, the one I used before this one, which made me want to go back to this one, the new one that was popular, says that he looks at her with the intensest and purest curiosity.

521
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,520
You see the difference.

522
00:43:46,520 --> 00:44:04,760
I mean, curiosity is what Yvonne felt when he stood on the landing listening to old Karamatsov batting around and thinking about how he was acting, knowing that he was going to, with Yvonne knowing he was going to die, or somehow imagining that he was going to die.

523
00:44:04,759 --> 00:44:07,879
Anyway, so it's curiosity is just the wrong thing.

524
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:13,719
It's Yvonne being the detached spectator, the one who does, I never can remember, what's it again?

525
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,439
The eyewitness.

526
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,199
Yeah, that's curiosity.

527
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:23,440
But this is something quite opposite of curiosity.

528
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,080
This is being totally involved with the other person.

529
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:28,240
That's why intensest interest is good.

530
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,359
And not wanting anything from them.

531
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:38,000
And so he's looking at her now for the first time, it turns out, looking at her with this kind of interest.

532
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:45,760
It's the first time he's looked at her at all, because he's afraid to look at her because she's so attractive.

533
00:44:45,759 --> 00:44:49,760
So that now comes out and turns out to be very important.

534
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:57,759
So on the middle of 337, she says, It's true, Alyasha.

535
00:44:57,759 --> 00:45:01,279
I had designs on you before because I was a horrid, violent preacher.

536
00:45:01,279 --> 00:45:04,399
But at other times, I looked upon you, Alyasha, as my conscience.

537
00:45:04,399 --> 00:45:10,480
I've kept thinking, anyhow, how anyone like that despises the natural, nasty thing like me.

538
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,440
I read that a little too soon, but it doesn't matter.

539
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,520
Why does she think that he despises her?

540
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,319
I said, because he's afraid to look at her.

541
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:29,840
And you get that on 340 about a few lines into that big bottom paragraph.

542
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:31,600
I wanted to ruin you, Alyasha.

543
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,040
That's the holy truth.

544
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,560
I quite meant to.

545
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,880
I wanted to so much that I bribed Rakitin to bring you.

546
00:45:38,879 --> 00:45:41,760
That's now we know what the other motive was.

547
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,920
And why did I want to do such a thing?

548
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,839
You knew nothing about it, Alyasha.

549
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,119
You turned away from me.

550
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,920
If you passed me on the street, you dropped your eyes.

551
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,599
And I looked at you a hundred times before today.

552
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,359
I began asking everyone about you.

553
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,040
Your face haunted my heart.

554
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,040
He despises me, I thought.

555
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,199
Wait, you're losing me.

556
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,759
So now, now something very interesting is happening here.

557
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:16,040
We remember always that you affect other people for better and for worse in ways you don't know.

558
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:30,199
Alyasha had no idea he was driving Brushenka into a sense of total humiliation because she thought he was despising her when he was just busy trying not to look at her and lust after her.

559
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:43,080
But it turns out that this being despised by him when she was already humiliated by her position in the world was tremendously upsetting to her.

560
00:46:43,879 --> 00:46:45,559
And that's what she's saying.

561
00:46:45,879 --> 00:46:49,800
And now we put it all together.

562
00:46:49,799 --> 00:46:51,880
She has no self-respect.

563
00:46:51,879 --> 00:46:58,759
The one person whose opinion she would love to have admire her and respect her is Alyasha.

564
00:46:58,759 --> 00:47:02,840
And he dislikes her so much she thinks that he can't even stand to look at her.

565
00:47:02,839 --> 00:47:05,320
And then comes the big flip.

566
00:47:05,799 --> 00:47:14,440
He's now sitting on her lap, and he's looking at her, protected by his sorrow, and full of active love.

567
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,079
And that changes everything.

568
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:24,440
He is, at this point, an angel, an existentialized angel.

569
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:33,400
Just as devils exploit situations to bring out the worst in people, angels in a situation bring out the best in people.

570
00:47:33,399 --> 00:47:40,919
Now, the joke almost is that if I tell you Alyasha is an angel, you might say, well, sort of.

571
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,760
I mean, that's just a metaphor.

572
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:44,039
It's not.

573
00:47:44,679 --> 00:47:47,240
He is an existentialized angel.

574
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:52,479
And Dostoevsky, in this funny way, never lets you forget what he's existentializing.

575
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,360
This one is at the bottom of 155.

576
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,760
Ivan is feeling very bad.

577
00:47:59,759 --> 00:48:05,920
No, Dmitri is feeling very bad for himself and feeling despairing and in misery and so forth.

578
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,439
And let's go to the bottom of one.

579
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,199
Why go on blundering on earth, dishonoring it with my presence?

580
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:12,960
And then I heard you come in.

581
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,920
Heavens.

582
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,440
It was as though something flew down on me suddenly.

583
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,719
And here and so forth.

584
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:25,040
Well, that's a pretty weird way to describe the arrival of Alyasha's heavens, and something flew down on me.

585
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:35,280
And just that will connect with the fact that every time Alyasha does anything, from now on in the book, practically, people will say, you angel, to him.

586
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:40,560
And Grushenka's the first one to say that on 155.

587
00:48:40,879 --> 00:48:42,080
No, not where am I?

588
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:42,799
That's where I was.

589
00:48:42,799 --> 00:48:45,199
Let's go back to 344.

590
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:51,199
That's what I mean that so many things are happening.

591
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,559
Okay, here we are, a quarter of the way down on 344.

592
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,559
Why did you not come before, you angel?

593
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,640
She fell on her knees before Alyasha.

594
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,199
I've been waiting all my life for someone like you.

595
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:05,760
I knew that someone like you would come and forgive me.

596
00:49:05,759 --> 00:49:10,799
I believe that nasty as I am, someone would really love me, not only with a lustful love.

597
00:49:10,799 --> 00:49:13,359
That is not with Eros, but with Agape.

598
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:15,039
That's what she was waiting for.

599
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,800
That's what she got.

600
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:20,800
Now, it looks like, what has Alyasha done?

601
00:49:20,799 --> 00:49:47,560
Well, if it's true that her only alternatives in going back to the pole were destructive ones, namely like a dog or with a knife, he's offered her, and that was because she was so humiliated and felt that she was so despicable, by giving her a sense of her own worth and value and looking at her with interest and treating her with respect and love, Alyasha's created a new possibility for her, which is not destructive.

602
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:53,640
He gives her a new, his love transforms her perception of her situation.

603
00:49:53,960 --> 00:50:03,719
Nothing happens that's against the law of physics and chemistry, but nonetheless, he manages to change the world and save Grushenka.

604
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:11,320
Now, you might think, you might think, yeah, okay, that's right, that's what happened.

605
00:50:11,319 --> 00:50:13,879
But that's not what Dostoevsky wants you to think.

606
00:50:13,879 --> 00:50:23,800
Dostoevsky is about to hit you over the head with the question, suppose I had asked you at the beginning of the lecture, as I meant to do it for God, what's the miracle?

607
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:28,600
We've seen that you need miracles in order to have faith.

608
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,759
Alyasha demonstrates that.

609
00:50:30,759 --> 00:50:39,079
Even somebody who's loving and having his faith as much as Alyasha and everything supporting him goes and almost loses his faith because there's no miracle.

610
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,719
That's the first thesis in the Grand Inquisitor.

611
00:50:41,719 --> 00:50:43,960
Therefore, we have to have miracles.

612
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:46,759
But they better not be against the laws of physics and chemistry.

613
00:50:46,759 --> 00:50:48,600
Well, what is a miracle then?

614
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:50,840
What's the miracle?

615
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:56,039
Well, the miracle, I don't really expect you to know, neither does Dostoevsky because he has to hit you over the head with it in a minute.

616
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:11,000
Well, the miracle is to create a new possibility and a new situation just out of love, which changes the world for somebody so that they can do something positive instead of something negative, that they can, and he just did this.

617
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:32,160
He just transformed Grushenka from humiliated and despised to having enough self-respect that it looks like she can, and it turns out she can go back to the pole and neither like a dog nor with a knife, but just to see whether she wants to ignore him, tell him how bad he treated her, marry him, who knows?

618
00:51:33,279 --> 00:51:36,560
And why would one want to say that that's a miracle?

619
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,040
That seems a bit maybe much.

620
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,400
But here it goes on 345.

621
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:49,120
You could make your point best, remember, if you put your opinion in the mouth of your enemy, Dostoevsky thinks.

622
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:54,160
So who says, so Rakitin says, two-thirds of the way down.

623
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,199
Well, so you saved the sinner, he laughed spitefully.

624
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:00,400
Have you turned the Madeline into the true path?

625
00:52:00,399 --> 00:52:02,639
Driven out the seven devils, eh?

626
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:06,719
So you see the miracles you were looking for just now have come to pass.

627
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:16,880
So there he is, saying it clearly that this is what Dostoevsky thinks an existentialized miracle is.

628
00:52:16,879 --> 00:52:21,040
And it's great that he puts it in the mouth of the devil.

629
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:29,839
And then he says a little more, sort of funny at the bottom, damnation take you all, he cried suddenly, why the devil did I take you up to Grushenka?

630
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:32,239
I don't want to see you anymore, and so forth.

631
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:33,440
And he runs off.

632
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:39,600
Every once in a while, Alyasha drives off the devil, sometimes in more wonderful ways than this one.

633
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,799
Keep your eyes open.

634
00:52:40,799 --> 00:52:44,160
And Rakitin is always being driven out.

635
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:48,640
The devil is being driven out by the angel here, existentially.

636
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,800
That happens every once in a while.

637
00:52:51,759 --> 00:52:54,319
And now comes, but that's not enough.

638
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:56,239
I mean, maybe this is just an accident.

639
00:52:56,239 --> 00:53:06,160
Maybe I'm making too much of a fuss about this being the miracle that the Grand Inquisitor, of the wrong, that the Grand Inquisitor has the wrong kind of miracle, that this is the right kind.

640
00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:09,160
So Dostoevsky's going to hammer this one home.

641
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,240
So what happens next?

642
00:53:11,239 --> 00:53:13,320
Well, the effect is reciprocal.

643
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:22,120
Not only does Alyasha transform Grushenka, but Grushenka restores Alyasha's faith, and he goes back to the monastery.

644
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,760
And something new and important happens.

645
00:53:24,759 --> 00:53:28,199
Because we still have to ask the following important question.

646
00:53:28,199 --> 00:53:30,120
Dostoevsky is so logical.

647
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,719
He never loses his trap.

648
00:53:31,879 --> 00:53:33,639
We've only done half the job.

649
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,400
There's been a miracle.

650
00:53:35,399 --> 00:53:37,719
But is it Zosima's miracle?

651
00:53:37,719 --> 00:53:42,199
I mean, the question is, he needs a miracle to confirm his faith in Zosima.

652
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:44,840
He got a miracle with Grushenka.

653
00:53:44,839 --> 00:53:47,319
But what's that got to do with Zosima?

654
00:53:47,319 --> 00:53:49,320
Well, we'll find out.

655
00:53:49,399 --> 00:53:53,479
Turns out that the miracle is traceable to Zosima.

656
00:53:53,480 --> 00:54:01,480
And again, it's Rakitin who says it in a very funny way at the top of 342.

657
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:10,840
You are so primed up with your elders' teaching last night, and now that you've let it off on me, Alyasha, man of God, said Rakitin, smiling with hatred.

658
00:54:10,839 --> 00:54:14,440
That is, he is loaded up with Zosima's love.

659
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:23,719
And now that Zosima is not the object of, that is, he's loaded up with the love that was generated by Zosima in him.

660
00:54:24,199 --> 00:54:26,679
But now Zosima is gone.

661
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:32,040
And this love is free to go out to other people, as it starts out with Grushenka.

662
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:36,839
So he's loaded up on love by this unconditional commitment to Zosima.

663
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:41,719
That's the sense in which Dostoevsky agrees with Kierkegaard.

664
00:54:41,719 --> 00:54:49,560
But once you've got this unconditional commitment, you've got to get beyond it to and not have all your love just going to one person.

665
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:57,999
You've got to take that love and make it available to and turn it on to the person, anybody in the vicinity who needs it.

666
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:00,400
That's how it happens.

667
00:55:00,399 --> 00:55:08,160
So now it turns out that it was Zosima's love that created this miracle at second hand through Alyasha.

668
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:12,400
And again, of course, without any abrogation of the laws of nature.

669
00:55:12,399 --> 00:55:16,240
So the saintliness of Zosima is now confirmed.

670
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:21,919
And so Alyasha can now love Zosima and love everybody else too.

671
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:24,959
But even then, Dostoevsky thinks you might miss it.

672
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:26,799
So we're going to get more.

673
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:30,480
I mean, he's going to rub it in that this is his version of miracles.

674
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:34,479
I think it's a nice thing he's doing it because it really is such a neat move.

675
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:51,440
On 347, he goes back to the monastery, and lo and behold, by an amazing coincidence, he walks in just as Father Pius is reading from the Bible about the first miracle at the bottom of 346.

676
00:55:51,759 --> 00:55:59,760
And it turns out, and the third day there was a marriage in Canaan of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there, and both Jesus was called and his disciples.

677
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,120
Marriage, what's that?

678
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,199
Floated through Alyasha's mind.

679
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:04,959
There is happiness for her too.

680
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,239
She's gone to the feast.

681
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:08,640
No, she's not taken the knife and so forth.

682
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:14,080
He's reviewing that Grushenka can now go back with self-respect.

683
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:17,759
And then he says a little about a third of the way down, I love that passage.

684
00:56:17,759 --> 00:56:20,880
It's Canaan of Galilee, the first miracle.

685
00:56:20,879 --> 00:56:24,640
Ah, that miracle, sweet miracle, and so forth.

686
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:31,440
And the miracle was that there was not enough, I believe, that wasn't that there was the time when there was not enough fish.

687
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:36,840
And Jesus, wine, not fish, only wine, no fish.

688
00:56:37,719 --> 00:56:39,480
Okay, sorry about that.

689
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:42,919
Anyway, so he's making wine, and they made enough for everybody.

690
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,359
Are you sure there's no fish?

691
00:56:46,359 --> 00:57:03,400
Because I read it The New Yorker, which is so accurate, had a funny story, which I thought was, I believed, and it's the story about, they had this story when the passion movie of what's the name of the guy who made it?

692
00:57:03,799 --> 00:57:05,239
Mel Gibson was out.

693
00:57:05,239 --> 00:57:10,920
And they had this diary of a girl who had a crush on Jesus at that time.

694
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,919
And it's a big old, crazy thing.

695
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:17,319
But in one place, she said, and he did the following marvelous miracle.

696
00:57:17,719 --> 00:57:21,160
He was at the wedding and there wasn't enough fish, and he invented canopies.

697
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:21,560
You know what?

698
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:24,280
Those are little things with little bits of fish in them.

699
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:30,120
This wonderful, demagicalizing of the miracle in the craziest way.

700
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,120
So I believe there was fish.

701
00:57:32,679 --> 00:57:36,840
And that'll teach me to believe what I read in the New Yorker.

702
00:57:36,839 --> 00:57:37,480
Okay.

703
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:42,120
Anyway, so Father Pisces is reading about the miracle.

704
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:45,559
And it's traced back to Zosima.

705
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:50,919
And now he has a vision, which I can't fully explain why it's important.

706
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,600
Everything's happening at once.

707
00:57:53,399 --> 00:58:01,480
In this vision, the elder took Alyasha by the hand, this is the middle of 348, and raised him from his knees.

708
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:06,759
And that's important, believe it or not.

709
00:58:06,759 --> 00:58:09,080
It's important because he touched him.

710
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,600
I'm worried about this.

711
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:21,359
You'll see that there's going to be a demagicalized apostolic succession where bishops are created by the previous bishop laying his hand on that bishop.

712
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:25,120
It started with Jesus, I take it, laying his hand on Peter.

713
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:29,040
And I worried about this for reasons I can't fully explain.

714
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,600
Zosima had to lay his hands on Alyasha.

715
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,120
That's just something that has to happen.

716
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,399
It's like in Star Trek.

717
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:43,440
There's the time when Spock has to touch somebody to pass on his special spiritual thing to that person.

718
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,760
That kind of thing is happening in here.

719
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,959
But I can't tell you yet.

720
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:53,440
This is related to the unseen finger, believe it or not.

721
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:59,280
This is all kinds of weird stuff is happening in the background, which if you keep reading, you'll be able to figure out.

722
00:58:59,279 --> 00:59:09,679
So he touches him, and then he says, Why do I need this?

723
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,240
448?

724
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,359
I know what's wrong there.

725
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:30,400
So look at 348 now, below the middle there, the end of the next paragraph.

726
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:32,960
And many of you have been given an onion.

727
00:59:34,879 --> 00:59:38,880
Now, I can't explain to you about the onion yet, so just get to the last sentence.

728
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:40,239
Begin your work, dear one.

729
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:41,839
Begin it, gentlemen.

730
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:45,600
That is, begin your work of doing good things outside the monastery.

731
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,359
Do you see our son?

732
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:49,040
Do you see him?

733
00:59:49,040 --> 01:00:06,119
Well, I've got to stop with that, because in a peculiar way, that's not a good idea for the Zosima to bring Jesus in, because Jesus has to be existentialized.

734
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:10,199
He's not just the sun with a capital S and a capital H.

735
01:00:11,319 --> 01:00:14,199
We have to get a Jesus in the book.

736
01:00:14,199 --> 01:00:15,880
We're going to get that next time.

737
01:00:15,879 --> 01:00:19,800
But it's not sun in the Russian, interestingly enough.

738
01:00:19,799 --> 01:00:24,199
And in another translation, it gets translated sun, S-U-N.

739
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:38,520
And would you believe, it seems incredible, that there could be a word in Russian that could either be translated sun and then mean Jesus, or S-U-N and then mean something like the Supreme Being.

740
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:41,479
And the answer is yes, there is.

741
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:46,360
It's a Russian word, I was told, that means something like the light of my life.

742
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:52,439
So Zosima is saying, do you see the light of my life?

743
01:00:52,759 --> 01:01:11,639
And you can either hear that, as Zosima having a vision of Jesus, or you can hear it, I think, the way Dostoevsky wants to hear it, which is that there is something, which is a light in terms of which you see everything.

744
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,800
I have to try, this sounds very weird.

745
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,040
So think of it this way.

746
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:26,520
Just as in Kierkegaard, God was this field in which people lived, this atmosphere in which all things were possible if you were a Christian and believed that faith.

747
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:33,480
Dostoevsky believes there's a field of light in which everything lights up a certain way.

748
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:36,120
And that God is that field.

749
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:42,039
And you can say that when you see everything in God's light, you see it in a certain way.

750
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,959
And we're going to get there any minute.

751
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,559
We have time just to do it.

752
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,800
I can't say more about it.

753
01:01:47,799 --> 01:01:49,800
Well, I will in an instant.

754
01:01:49,799 --> 01:02:00,800
What would this look like, this story, that God is a field of something or other, which is what you can experience, and then you experience everything else in terms of that field?

755
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:02,560
Well, Dostoevsky's about to tell you.

756
01:02:03,279 --> 01:02:05,359
Now he's going to existentialize God.

757
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:07,360
He's getting more and more out of control.

758
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:09,280
But this is the ultimate move.

759
01:02:09,279 --> 01:02:17,679
And he's got his own story about God, and there's not going to be a supreme being in it, just as in Kierkegaard, there isn't a supreme being in it.

760
01:02:17,679 --> 01:02:20,320
But it's so different from Kierkegaard.

761
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:24,559
So right in the middle of the book, Dostoevsky is going to do this.

762
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:32,640
He's going to show you, Alyasha is going to experience God, insofar as there is such something or other.

763
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,879
And so now let's sort of set the scene.

764
01:02:34,879 --> 01:02:37,840
It's so moving, and I hope you all got here.

765
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:39,440
It is so beautiful.

766
01:02:39,759 --> 01:02:56,080
So in the middle of the book, after he does the miracle, and after he sees that it was Osima's miracle, and after he sees that it's existentialized, Jesus' early first miracle, all of a sudden, he runs out of the monastery.

767
01:02:56,080 --> 01:03:02,479
And so on 349, he runs out.

768
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:10,320
He didn't stop on the steps either, but went quickly down, his soul overflowing with rapture, yearning for freedom, space, and openness.

769
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:14,879
Now, by the way, if you think of this as a movie, it's a huge tour de force.

770
01:03:14,879 --> 01:03:29,520
Everything has been, if you sort of think about it, up close, inside, sort of black and white, and everybody in everybody's face, always confessing and yelling and having outbursts of every sort and so forth.

771
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:37,719
All of a sudden, it's like it turns to cinema scope and color, and nature, which you never see in Dostoevsky, or hardly ever.

772
01:03:37,719 --> 01:03:38,760
All of this.

773
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:41,080
I'm amazed that he can write this.

774
01:03:41,399 --> 01:03:45,879
The vault of heaven, full of soft shining stars, stretched vast and fathomless above him.

775
01:03:45,879 --> 01:03:49,719
The Milky Way ran in two pale streams from zenith to the horizon.

776
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:57,560
Let's skip a little, the white towers and golden domes, see color of the church gleamed out against the sapphire sky.

777
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:00,279
Autumn flowers in the garden were slumbering.

778
01:04:00,279 --> 01:04:06,440
The silence of the earth, instead of everybody screaming at everybody, suddenly there's nothing on the soundtrack.

779
01:04:06,679 --> 01:04:10,039
The silence of the earth seemed to melt into the silence of the heaven.

780
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:13,320
The mystery of the earth was one with the mystery of the stars.

781
01:04:13,319 --> 01:04:16,759
Alyasha stood and gazed and suddenly threw himself on the earth.

782
01:04:16,759 --> 01:04:28,040
He didn't know why he embraced it, but he could not have told why he longed irresistibly to kiss it and kiss it weeping and watering with his tears and vowed passionately to love it, to love it forever and ever.

783
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,840
That's something Zosima told him to do.

784
01:04:30,839 --> 01:04:35,320
Now comes the field of love.

785
01:04:36,199 --> 01:04:37,559
Why was he weeping?

786
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:44,120
Oh, in his rapture, he was weeping over those stars that were shining to him from the abyss of space, and he was not ashamed of that ecstasy.

787
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,960
Another quote from Zosima.

788
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,559
None more plagiarism.

789
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:57,640
There seemed to be threads from all those innumerable worlds of God linking his soul to them, and his soul was trembling all over in contact with other worlds.

790
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:02,679
And he longed to forgive everyone for everything and to beg forgiveness and so forth.

791
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:08,679
Now, that's the God is the field of connectedness.

792
01:05:08,679 --> 01:05:14,839
That everything is, I'll quote you a quote in a minute from Zosima.

793
01:05:14,839 --> 01:05:22,160
Everything is like an ocean, all interrelated, and everything touches everything.

794
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,719
So I have to find that.

795
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:34,000
So just let me review, no mention of God in that passage.

796
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:40,960
God is the experience that everything is linked to everything, the field in which all things are related.

797
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:45,440
Just as the sun is the field in which all things appear to one another.

798
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,480
Plato talks about the sun that way.

799
01:05:48,480 --> 01:06:06,560
But the interesting thing is, Plato, when he talks about the sun as the field in which everything shows up and is intelligible, also talks about the sun as this supreme being-like something, which makes all of this field of light possible.

800
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:10,400
Dostoevsky's pulling an amazingly interesting move.

801
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:14,000
He's going to get rid of the sun and keep the light.

802
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,319
Because that's what he wants.

803
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:17,120
He wants this field.

804
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,479
He doesn't want this object.

805
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:28,800
In fact, if you start bringing in God as a supreme being, you get that you should be loving God instead of all these other creatures in the field.

806
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:31,199
In fact, that's what happens with Augustine.

807
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:39,520
Augustine takes over from Plato this totally fulfilling supreme being.

808
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:49,359
And then Augustine's love is all directed toward the supreme being, and he hasn't any love left over for particular people anymore, like he had for his friend early on that I mentioned.

809
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:51,440
And the same thing happens with Dante.

810
01:06:51,440 --> 01:07:02,239
Dante loved Beatrice, but when he finally gets a vision of God, he just drops Beatrice, because after all, what could be more fulfilling than a direct vision of God?

811
01:07:02,639 --> 01:07:05,960
That's a long way to go, Dostoevsky thinks.

812
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:07,000
I may have mentioned this.

813
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:14,439
I was delighted to learn from some student one day that Augustine is not considered a saint by the Orthodox fur.

814
01:07:14,439 --> 01:07:18,439
I don't know any more about that, but I think that's brilliant on their part.

815
01:07:18,439 --> 01:07:20,439
And I would like to hear, I'd like to hear more.

816
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:30,040
That's the beginning, Augustine, of Plato and philosophy sort of leaking into the early Christian church, and nothing to be proud of.

817
01:07:30,519 --> 01:07:34,519
So Dostoevsky's got to keep the light and get rid of the sun.

818
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,080
That's his job.

819
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:39,479
And now we're going to find out about that.

820
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:46,759
First, it's about, let's first do it in terms of an ocean of love, and then I'll tell you about the light.

821
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:55,399
On 3:10, Zosimus is talking, and he says, in the first full paragraph, My brother asked the birds to forgive him.

822
01:07:55,399 --> 01:07:57,239
That sounds senseless, but it was right.

823
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:58,599
For all is like an ocean.

824
01:07:58,599 --> 01:07:59,960
All is flowing and blending.

825
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:01,799
See, all interconnected.

826
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:12,359
A touch in one place sets up a movement at the other end of the earth, like a butterfly and wherever it is sets up a storm in some place else in the latest chaotic attractor theory.

827
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:16,120
So he has this view, how everything is interconnected.

828
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:18,120
And it goes skipping a little.

829
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:20,120
It's like an ocean, I tell you.

830
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,040
And that's enough for the time being.

831
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:23,080
Never mind the birds.

832
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:25,160
We'll get to the birds next time.

833
01:08:25,479 --> 01:08:27,559
So let's see now.

834
01:08:27,559 --> 01:08:31,879
We got the threads to other worlds, which I'm sure we are.

835
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:37,479
Okay, now we get to the light.

836
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:58,399
Way back once upon a time, I told you that it was strange that when Alyasha was being existentially baptized by his mother holding up to the icon, him holding up to the icon, that it was strange that he remembered the slanting rays of the sun more than he remembered the icon.

837
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:03,759
That's because the slanting rays are the connectedness.

838
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:07,120
And he's getting a sense of the connectedness of everything.

839
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,559
That's what he's getting.

840
01:09:08,559 --> 01:09:13,760
Now, if it only happened once with Alyasha, you wouldn't know what to think.

841
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:16,239
But look on 280.

842
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:25,679
This is how Zosima happened to go into the monastery, his first experience of the monastery, about in the last paragraph.

843
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:39,040
It was a fine day, this 280, and I remember today as though I saw it now, how the incense rose from the censer and floated upwards and overhead in the cupola, mingled in the rising waves with the sunlight that streamed in at the little window.

844
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,519
Well, you don't see the sun again.

845
01:09:41,519 --> 01:09:45,279
You see the rays of the sun in the smoke of the incense.

846
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:48,160
But even that, I mean, that's too far-fetched.

847
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:52,000
I mean, if I had to base my case just on that, I wouldn't be happy.

848
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,399
But there's a further move.

849
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,199
So on the next page, he says about 15 lines down.

850
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:04,080
I bless the rising sun each day and as before, my heart seems to meet you.

851
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:11,599
But now I love even more its setting and the long slanting rays and the soft gentle memories that come with them and so forth.

852
01:10:11,599 --> 01:10:16,080
So Alyasha, when he's baptized, experiences the slanting rays.

853
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:19,120
And again, it's the slanting rays that bring him to the monastery.

854
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:25,279
I read that earlier, that Zosima also was brought in by the slanting rays.

855
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,439
You don't have to make a big deal of it.

856
01:10:27,439 --> 01:10:32,000
And I'm not even sure Dostoevsky knows that he's doing it, but he is doing what he should be doing.

857
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:43,799
He's sort of downgrading the dazzling experience of the sun and giving you the connection, giving you an experience of the field of threads connecting everything to everything.

858
01:10:44,599 --> 01:10:46,919
And now I want to say something about these worlds.

859
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:49,239
Time is running out, but I think I can just finish.

860
01:10:50,359 --> 01:10:57,319
What are all these worlds that are connected to each other that he experiences when he falls on the earth?

861
01:10:57,319 --> 01:11:00,040
Well, I worried a long time about that.

862
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:01,319
I mean, it certainly isn't.

863
01:11:02,359 --> 01:11:07,639
Who's the guy who believes that there are millions of other stars and life must be on some of them?

864
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:08,759
Can't think of his.

865
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:09,239
What?

866
01:11:10,519 --> 01:11:12,439
No, not Drake.

867
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:14,439
No, this guy, he's died now.

868
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:17,160
He had a television program on it.

869
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:17,799
Huh?

870
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:19,319
Yes.

871
01:11:19,319 --> 01:11:20,120
Who?

872
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:21,639
You said it, somebody.

873
01:11:21,639 --> 01:11:22,760
Yes, Carl Sagan.

874
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:28,679
I mean, it's not Carl Sagan that there are millions of galaxies and millions of inhabited worlds.

875
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:29,959
What is it then?

876
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:36,279
Well, it's that whenever two people are gathered together, there is a world of living love.

877
01:11:36,279 --> 01:11:38,199
I think those are all the worlds.

878
01:11:38,199 --> 01:11:46,439
At the bottom of 311, if you, I've read it once, if two of you are gathered together, then there's a whole world, a world of living love, embrace each other, and so forth.

879
01:11:46,439 --> 01:11:49,319
And all these worlds are interconnected.

880
01:11:49,319 --> 01:11:52,439
And I think that's the world threads.

881
01:11:52,439 --> 01:11:56,519
I don't think that's something important, but I just was curious to what it was.

882
01:11:56,519 --> 01:12:00,279
Now let me skim and then because I'll sum up.

883
01:12:02,199 --> 01:12:04,599
So the sun is too platonic.

884
01:12:04,599 --> 01:12:06,359
It takes the love out of the world.

885
01:12:06,359 --> 01:12:10,439
What you want is the love in the world and between the worlds.

886
01:12:10,439 --> 01:12:13,959
And that's the vision that Alyasha has.

887
01:12:14,599 --> 01:12:17,559
And that's the field of love.

888
01:12:17,559 --> 01:12:21,279
That's the light in which you see everything.

889
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,719
Ah, yes, eternity.

890
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:29,519
Well, on 409, one, I told you so many things happen in this that you can hardly keep your width.

891
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:33,599
So now Dostoevsky is going to existentialize eternity.

892
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:38,160
And he's going to do it just the way Kierkegaard did it.

893
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:48,080
He's going to turn some kind of mathematical eternity that's outside of time into a forever kind of eternity.

894
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:54,160
That is something that's so meaningful in your life that you can never forget it.

895
01:12:54,160 --> 01:13:01,919
And that, and it will sort of be something, wow.

896
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,000
Don't get it.

897
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,439
I'm doing it again.

898
01:13:07,439 --> 01:13:08,319
I can't find it.

899
01:13:08,319 --> 01:13:09,040
Show me back to the...

900
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:09,920
Ah, here we are.

901
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:12,239
At the bottom of 349.

902
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:13,919
I wrote 249.

903
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:17,519
At the bottom of 349, you get the forever experience.

904
01:13:17,519 --> 01:13:22,479
Remember, it's very important to Kierkegaard, and you'll turn out to be very important to Dostoevsky.

905
01:13:22,479 --> 01:13:34,639
Already you saw it with childhood memories, that there have to be experiences that you never forget and that give and whose meaning never changes, but on whose meaning you can interpret everything else.

906
01:13:34,639 --> 01:13:37,359
And that's like this experience in the middle of the book.

907
01:13:37,359 --> 01:13:41,120
So we're going to read this at the very bottom of 349.

908
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:48,799
And with every instant, he felt clearly, as it were, tangibly, that something firm and unshakable as that vault of heaven had entered into his soul.

909
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:54,279
It was as though some idea, I think that's a bad word there, but I think it is in the Russian.

910
01:13:54,279 --> 01:13:59,120
Some, I don't know, some notion had seized the sovereignty of his mind.

911
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:03,040
And it was for all his life and forever and ever.

912
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:13,080
So, there, the forever and ever is he's had an eternity in time experience, and that's that's the forever.

913
01:14:13,399 --> 01:14:18,759
And now, one last remark, and you will get everything that you can get.

914
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:27,399
And I think it's sort of mind-boggling that he's got all this in here, but this is almost like a joke at the top of 350.

915
01:14:27,399 --> 01:14:32,759
Someone visited my soul in that hour, he used to say afterwards, with implicit faith.

916
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:36,199
Now, you just saw everything that happened.

917
01:14:36,199 --> 01:14:38,439
Did anybody visit his soul?

918
01:14:38,439 --> 01:14:45,160
Did we see Christ come and do something or fell up or God the Father or anything?

919
01:14:45,559 --> 01:14:49,879
Whatever he's talking about, we don't know who visited his soul.

920
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:56,839
It's something that Dostoevsky now has to give you an existentialized account of.

921
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:08,679
But the someone who visited his soul, I'll just let you know, is, as you might guess, the same mysterious finger wielder that pointed Zosima into the monastery.

922
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:16,679
And that someone is, and that someone is what got passed on to him when Zosima put his hand on him.

923
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:23,239
There's somebody in the background that all this love comes from.

924
01:15:23,239 --> 01:15:28,359
I wonder if anybody you know, I bet some of you know who it is.

925
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:32,120
It's going to be the demythologized Jesus in this book.

926
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:33,399
And you don't know who it is?

927
01:15:33,399 --> 01:15:34,519
I'm not going to tell you.

928
01:15:34,519 --> 01:15:35,719
You've got to figure it out.

929
01:15:36,359 --> 01:15:38,279
We'll start with it next time.

930
01:15:38,279 --> 01:15:39,239
Okay.
