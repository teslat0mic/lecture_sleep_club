00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,279
So here we are, where we have the question, whether anybody entered Alyasha's soul at the moment when he had his big mystical experience.

2
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:11,519
He says that somebody did.

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,880
And if it were somebody, it would be Jesus, presumably.

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:24,959
But obviously something's going on that we don't understand, something that's being existentialized.

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:37,759
This mysterious finger that points the way both for Joshua to go into the monastery and then points the way for Alyasha to go into the monastery.

6
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:40,880
What is this mysterious finger?

7
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,320
And I asked you last time, does anybody know?

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,199
And nobody knew.

9
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,880
Does anybody know now?

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:58,560
He's in the background, so to speak, running this whole show, who would be the demythologized Christ figure in the book who directs the lives of Zasma?

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,719
And what's the other thing?

12
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:02,159
You don't know yet.

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,000
Oh, Koskovsky's really fooled you.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,880
That's good.

15
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,560
But, and you can't, and he hits you over the head with it, but you don't see it.

16
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,440
That's typical.

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,639
I didn't see it for years.

18
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:28,680
But somewhere smuggled in is the story of the demythologized or de- or the existentialized Jesus and smuggled in at the same time the proof that it is really Jesus, that he's the existentializing.

19
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,880
So here we go.

20
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,240
It turns out to be Brother Markle.

21
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:41,000
So on 275, Zosima starts talking about his brother.

22
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:48,440
And he, at the bottom of 275, I'm surprised 275, that looks like 276 to me.

23
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,880
I see yes all around on 275, about two-thirds of the way down.

24
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:02,279
At the dawn of my life, when I was a child, I had an elder brother who died before my eyes at 17.

25
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:15,000
Later on in the course of my life, I gradually became convinced that that brother had been for a guidance and a sign for my time.

26
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:24,360
He had he not come into my life, I could never, perhaps, though I believe that he had become a monk on this practical path.

27
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,360
And turns out Alyasha reminds him.

28
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,120
Look, similar.

29
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,560
That's not the important thing.

30
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,680
The important thing is that Zosima thinks of him as guiding.

31
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,199
That's a long way from understanding what he's doing.

32
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:43,639
Okay, so we have to now look in detail.

33
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,320
Markle is really very, very important.

34
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:56,799
One of the ways you might get a glimmer that he's important, though, it's not the existentializing, it's just plot-wise.

35
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,440
Alyasha reminds Zosima of him on 275, a little further down.

36
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:16,959
Alyasha has some, though not a great resemblance in face, seems to me so like him spiritually that many times I've taken him for that young man, my brother, mysteriously come back to me as a reminder and inspiration.

37
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,079
And I wondered at so strange a dream in itself.

38
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:25,120
Well, in a way, there is a sense in which Alyasha is his brother, come back.

39
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:26,320
We'll see.

40
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:38,320
But Markle is also like Dimitri because he gets, he's very on 276, he's sort of brutal and frank and anti-religious.

41
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,279
At the bottom, he's at the very bottom of 276.

42
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:54,560
My elder brother Markle, he was eight years older than I was, of irritable disposition, but kind-hearted and never ironical.

43
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,240
Well, that fits Dimitri.

44
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,959
Certainly, Yvonne's ironical.

45
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:10,400
And so this guy has got to be sort of, well, you know, sort of Dimitri-like, passionate, hot-tempered, and so forth.

46
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,480
And he's also like Yvonne because he gets involved with a philosopher.

47
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:20,320
And that's bad for him, but he does.

48
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,879
He gets very interested in philosophy.

49
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,040
I have to find it now.

50
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,560
Now, hmm.

51
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:29,680
Should be in here, but I don't seem to have it.

52
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,760
Well, it's right in these pages, so I'll find it.

53
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:43,880
This secular socialist philosopher comes into the town.

54
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,000
Where is it?

55
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,239
At the top.

56
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:47,719
Okay.

57
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:53,080
Yes, right where I was, but a little further down, and I didn't mark it.

58
00:04:54,359 --> 00:05:03,880
He made friends about six lines down with the political exile who had been banished from Moscow to our town for free thinking and led a solitary existence there.

59
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:07,400
The man was a scholar, but gained distinction in philosophy.

60
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,560
Bad news, of course.

61
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,479
Something attracted him to Markle, and he used to come to see him.

62
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,360
He spent whole evenings with him and so forth.

63
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:20,839
Well, yeah, being a philosopher, there are two kinds of philosophers in the book.

64
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:25,880
Both of them equally wrong-headed, but it's important to keep them separate.

65
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:31,640
There's a place you'll see before the end of the day where Zosima talks about how much he likes philosophy.

66
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:33,080
It's so spiritual.

67
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:36,120
Well, that's Platonistic kind of philosophy.

68
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:49,480
And it's evidence that Zosima has never completely outgrown, sort of institutionalized Christianity, and that the Russian Orthodox Church didn't completely avoid getting corrupted by Plato.

69
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:55,959
But this is certainly no spiritual philosopher who's coming into town to corrupt Marko.

70
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:03,240
He's a free thinker, a kind of materialist, naturalist, atheist kind of philosophy.

71
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:07,160
And that's also a branch, a tradition in philosophy.

72
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,440
So either, yeah, both of them are wrong in two extremes.

73
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:16,759
They're either too heavenly, that's Plato, or they're too earthly, that's, there are lots of them.

74
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:30,240
We could say Hobbes, who's got something right about human nature, remember, that everybody's nasty and selfish, but he certainly hasn't got anything spiritual to do about it or save us from it.

75
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:34,719
So, and that's a kind of modern materialism, let's call it.

76
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:41,840
There's the sort of tradition, there's sort of ancient Greek spiritualism and modern European materialism.

77
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:44,080
Both of them are blamed on philosophy.

78
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:57,280
But Markle isn't really corrupted very long by that because he ends up having what I would call a supernatural experience.

79
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,680
And that's by supernatural, I definitely don't mean against the laws of physics and chemistry.

80
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,440
Nothing in the book happens against the laws of physics and chemistry.

81
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:30,960
But it's a supernatural experience in that it's an experience of what the world would be like and human beings would be like, which instead of being selfish in this Hobbes materialist modern way, they were loving like the early Christian community once they had learned from Jesus that what it was all about was agape love.

82
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:57,199
And what's interesting about Marko is that he gets transformed from the natural, rude, inconsiderable, inconsiderate human being that he starts out in the chapter on him into somebody who is supernatural in the sense that he has become transformed into a completely unselfish, loving person.

83
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:05,359
How that happens is important because, as I keep wanting to say, but you'll see it, I just want you to keep your eyes open for it.

84
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:12,520
Markle is going to be the Jesus figure in the book because, what does that mean?

85
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:28,599
Well, in jargon, of course, he's going to show what the incarnation, that's the fancy word for God becoming man in Jesus, what the incarnation amounts to as an existential, not a kind of magical, event.

86
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,280
And we'll see that we have to keep our eyes open for what it amounts to.

87
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,280
I'm going to get there little by little.

88
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:47,480
So notice first that when he's in his materialist stage, he won't fast and do sort of the kind of magical and ritual things that the church requires.

89
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:54,760
It's important to see that because he never goes back to these ritual things.

90
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:56,280
Where is it?

91
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,639
He's where he's laughed at.

92
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:03,880
Oh, yeah, right after where we're reading still, right after the mention of philosophy on 277.

93
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:06,839
It was the beginning of Lent, and Markle would not fast.

94
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,520
He was rude and laughed at it.

95
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,640
That's all silly.

96
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:14,440
And there's no God, he said, horrifying my mother, the servants, and me.

97
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,360
That's Markle when he's the bad guy.

98
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:21,320
But then something happens to Markle.

99
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:27,880
He gets TB, tuberculosis, and that gives him a very high fever.

100
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:33,880
And he becomes crazy, delirious, but delirious in a very important way.

101
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:42,520
It's typical of Dostoevsky not to want to make a distinction between what you're sick with and what you discover when you're sick.

102
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:52,800
We'll see, I mean, maybe you remember the mysterious visitor also dies of some strange disease of the heart, which also affected his mind.

103
00:09:53,520 --> 00:10:04,320
But the strange disease of the heart affected his mind, made the mysterious visitor a completely loving, happy father confessing and going to heaven on earth.

104
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:13,040
So Markle is sick, but that doesn't mean that he's anything, that he doesn't have a deep insight.

105
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,760
So let's look in the middle of that 277.

106
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:22,400
The doctor who came whispered to my mother that it was galloping consumption, that he would not live through the spring.

107
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,080
Consumption, fancy name for tuberculosis or an old name.

108
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,960
And so now we've got to see what happens to him as he gets sick.

109
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:40,639
He sees that he sort of begins to existentialize Christianity, though he wouldn't put it that way.

110
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,599
He doesn't know, he doesn't even care about Christianity, and he certainly doesn't know about existentializing.

111
00:10:45,599 --> 00:11:01,280
But he says, instead of saying to that his mother and the nurse, don't light the light in front of the icon because that's all silly superstition, at the top of 278, he says, Let me light the lamp before the holy image, my dear.

112
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,440
He says this to the old nurse.

113
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,000
Before this, he would have not allowed it, would have blown it out.

114
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:09,920
Light it, light it, dear nurse.

115
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,600
I was a wretch to have prevented you from doing it before.

116
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:17,280
You pray when you light the lamp, and I pray when I see you.

117
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,360
So we are praying to the same God.

118
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:34,320
Now he's beginning to sort of say, yes, it's a fine thing to light the lamp, and what it means to you is different than what it means to me, but it all is something related to God, which we haven't understood yet.

119
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,520
And he hasn't understood yet, or at least if he has, he hasn't said it yet.

120
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,079
So now he's beginning to go crazy.

121
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:46,199
And, of course, remember that the mysterious visitor.

122
00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:50,360
So, in Dostoevsky's reading of it, I think Jesus too.

123
00:11:50,359 --> 00:12:15,960
All these people have to go crazy because they see something so supernatural, so alien to the way human beings normally are, and take it for granted that human beings always are, that they can't sort of find any language for this or any precedent for this or any way of relating to this other way of being.

124
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:19,239
Now, that sounds still mysterious, but it'll get clearer.

125
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,199
What, let's see who we are.

126
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:25,880
So, what's he see when he begins to go crazy?

127
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:35,080
Well, he's experiencing this overwhelming love that flows through the universe.

128
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:41,639
On 301, it says, I have my doubts why I say 301.

129
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,440
Yeah?

130
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,479
No?

131
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,999
Maybe that's the mysterious visitor's version of it.

132
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:57,719
When the mysterious visitor version of it, well, I might as well, I open to this page, it's no accident.

133
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:05,560
It's the other illness, but it's so peculiar on 301, what they say about the illness of the mysterious visitor.

134
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,359
The nature of his illness, I can't explain.

135
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:11,079
That's the sort of dumb narrator again.

136
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:22,560
They said it was an ailment of the heart, but it became known that the doctors had been induced by his wife to look into his mental condition also and come to the conclusion that it was a case of insanity.

137
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:35,679
So insanity means people are doing things and saying things that normal, natural, everyday human beings can't understand, couldn't say, wouldn't say.

138
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:37,199
And what is he saying?

139
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:49,679
Well, on 278, he's saying things like the middle of the page, don't cry, mother, life is paradise, and we are all in paradise, but we refuse to see it.

140
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:52,879
If we would, we should have heaven on earth the next day.

141
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:58,800
This is now he's beginning to really rave existential ravings.

142
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,560
So let's see here.

143
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,919
So anybody who experiences this love will look crazy to everybody, including themselves.

144
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:15,119
It isn't as if they understand what they're doing.

145
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:16,719
They're just raving.

146
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,280
But they are in touch with something absolutely crucial.

147
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:34,239
They're in touch with the connectedness of everything that Alyasha experienced when he fell on the ground and had the experience of all the threads connecting all of God's world, as Dostievsky puts it.

148
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:42,959
Now you may well wonder why Alyasha isn't crazy and raving if he had that experience.

149
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,879
Well, that's no accident that he is.

150
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:46,480
But I can't explain that yet.

151
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:58,640
By the end of today, you'll see why Dosima and the mysterious visitor and Jesus have to seem crazy to themselves and everybody else in a way that Alyasha doesn't.

152
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,679
That's important.

153
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,280
We just first we have to get what Markle says.

154
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:22,199
And I just repeat that they experience this love that selfish people like us can't understand, and there's no precedent, no language, no practices, no institutions for making it intelligible.

155
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:33,320
Now there are sort of Christian practices at the time of Markle, but you're supposed to think of it as if Markle has no knowledge of or use of or understanding of the Christian language and practice.

156
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:46,040
He's supposed to be like the Jesus must have been when he was in the early community, which wasn't even the Christian community because it hadn't been named yet, and nobody had any understanding.

157
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:57,240
And Jesus was going around saying that everybody should love each other in a way that nobody had ever said before in any culture at any time, this kind of agape love.

158
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,199
But they didn't have a word for it, agape love.

159
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:09,639
So, and this love is now what's coming through, so to speak, Markle.

160
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:13,879
And I want to find the place where he says it on page 310.

161
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:16,199
You've got to read that carefully.

162
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,040
My brother, this is Zosima talking.

163
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,759
My brother asked the birds to forgive him.

164
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,479
That sounds senseless, but it was right.

165
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,920
For all is like an ocean.

166
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,360
All is flowing and blending.

167
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,639
Touch in one place sets up movement at the other end of the earth.

168
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:41,560
It may be senseless to give beg forgiveness of the birds, but birds would be happier at your side, a little happier anyway, and children and all animals, if you yourself were nobler than you are.

169
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,599
It's like an ocean, I tell you, and so forth.

170
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,159
Let me go a little further.

171
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:51,360
Then you would pray to the birds too, consumed by an all-embracing love.

172
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:52,800
That's what's happening to them.

173
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:55,280
That's their craziness.

174
00:16:55,599 --> 00:17:00,399
And treasure that ecstasy, however senseless it may seem to men.

175
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,520
It seems crazy, it seems insane.

176
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,959
This is this kind of ecstasy of connectedness to everything, but that's really what's going on.

177
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,839
Instead of threads of possible worlds here, it's called an ocean of love.

178
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,839
But the main thing is everything is connected to everything else.

179
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:27,759
And if you experience that connectedness, you experience it with this kind of ecstasy, and you show it by a kind of love.

180
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:35,599
Now, you could say then that Markle is the incarnation.

181
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:59,679
If Jesus is supposedly God, who has taken on a body in order to manifest sort of what he stands for, well, Markle has taken on a way of life to manifest what God, so Jesus is God, but God manifested a certain space and certain place in time as a human being.

182
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,639
So Markle is doing that.

183
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:16,720
Markle is, without knowing it or wanting to do it, manifesting in his life and now, when he becomes transformed from his fever, manifest in his life an understanding of what?

184
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,119
Of the connectedness of everything.

185
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:22,000
That God is the connectedness of everything.

186
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,079
Remember now, you've got to keep this straight.

187
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:30,639
This isn't the God of the Supreme Being, where Plato and Judaism got all mixed into Christianity.

188
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:35,999
Dostoevsky's God is a field, is an atmosphere, like in Kierkegaard.

189
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,040
They both get rid of the Supreme Being.

190
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,479
For Kierkegaard, God is that all things are possible.

191
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,199
For Dostoevsky, God is that all things are connected.

192
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,560
And how would you be an incarnation?

193
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:57,479
You'd be the manifestation, demonstrating in your life that all things are connected.

194
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:04,520
And Dostoevsky thinks that's what Jesus did, and he thinks an existential, and he thinks there'll be lots of these incarnations.

195
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:15,239
Every time somebody goes crazy enough to get in touch with this love and lives it for a while before they die of it, then you get another incarnation.

196
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,120
The special thing about Jesus was he was the first.

197
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:20,280
In that sense, he's the incarnation.

198
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:33,879
But Markle is another one, another instance where God becomes manifest in the life of and the actions of an individual human being.

199
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,679
So now we can put this together.

200
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:39,239
And let me just catch up.

201
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:50,919
So the Markle dies, the mysterious visitor dies, Jesus dies, none of these, and so does the idiot die.

202
00:19:50,919 --> 00:20:07,719
None of these people can live in this sort of wicked and selfish and rational materialist kind of world because they are just raving mad by the standards of the world.

203
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,599
And that gets expressed in Dostoevsky by them dying of brain fever.

204
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,480
Yeah.

205
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:33,280
Boy, you're right on, yes.

206
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,839
Okay, well, the terrific question.

207
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:40,960
You're really with it.

208
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,159
Yes, something very important is happening.

209
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,679
Namely, it's just a different version of Christianity that Dostoevsky's got.

210
00:20:49,679 --> 00:21:00,159
He thinks the Protestant Kierkegaard one is much too individual, that when you've got your one defining commitment, you care altogether about that person and don't pay any attention really to anybody else.

211
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,439
It happens to Alyasha.

212
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:05,439
While he's hooked on Zasima, he does no good deeds for anybody.

213
00:21:05,439 --> 00:21:12,159
And then, so Kierkegaard, so Dostoevsky says that's not the real meaning of the Christian church.

214
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,999
That could have only happened after this big heresy with Luther and all that.

215
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,759
This very individualist, very anti-universal, as you say, understanding of Christian love.

216
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:30,879
The real Christian love, Dostoevsky will say, is agape, is universal love of everybody.

217
00:21:30,879 --> 00:21:35,280
The way to put it in Christian jargon is love your neighbor.

218
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:48,320
And your neighbor changes, and it's not, you don't have an unconditional commitment to your neighbor, but you're ready to give everything you've got to help your neighbor, even if necessary, die for your neighbor, Jesus says.

219
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:51,199
And that's just a different story.

220
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,999
In the end, if you'll have to think about what to believe, you'll just have to figure out which one you believe.

221
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,159
It helps to have the right kind of mystical experience to go with it.

222
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:14,119
I don't think you can tell unless you actually have this experience that Dostoevsky is trying to show you and sort of put you in the position to have that Alyasha has in the middle of the book.

223
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:18,040
Then Dostoevsky will say, you see, that's the real Christian experience.

224
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,040
It is the universal church.

225
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:30,280
Or you can have the unconditional commitment experience of Kierkegaard, and it will seem to you like that's the central meaningful thing in your life.

226
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:36,439
The one thing they both have in common, interestingly enough, is that they give you eternity in time.

227
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:41,560
Kierkegaard's eternity comes from you love this person forever.

228
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:49,879
Dostoevsky's eternity comes from you live your life in terms of this mystical experience of the connectedness of everything forever.

229
00:22:49,879 --> 00:22:54,040
Where forever means, remember, existentialized, as long as you live.

230
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:59,159
There's no other forever that they claim they know anything about.

231
00:22:59,159 --> 00:22:59,800
Yeah.

232
00:23:06,439 --> 00:23:07,560
What do they think?

233
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:16,280
Not to me yet.

234
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:19,960
That's true.

235
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:20,839
It's funny.

236
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:24,440
My favorite philosopher Heidegger says, yes, we all have the same now.

237
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:31,720
But I don't know if that helps any because the materialist, selfish people are having the same now too, and they're not loving anybody.

238
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,679
So I think that probably won't do it.

239
00:23:35,639 --> 00:23:43,239
It has to be a special religious eternal and eternity in time kind of now, like the one we're talking about.

240
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:50,119
Okay, now comes the fun question: how am I making this up that it's demythologized Jesus?

241
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:58,639
Or is Dostoevsky going to hit you over the head or hide you, hide it like a sort of Easter egg somewhere in the text that he's doing that?

242
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:17,919
Well, good old Dostoevsky, it never fails that if he's up to one of these things, and you should remember that in your paper if you try to do the paper on mystery and authority, you only know you've got it right when you find out where Dostoevsky has sort of hid the answer that he's trying to give.

243
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,119
Okay, so here we are.

244
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:29,679
Markle's going crazy, and I've lost where Markle's going crazy, so we have to find it again on 278.

245
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,800
Here we are.

246
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:50,479
Okay, now after the middle of the page, where he says life is paradise, and then he says, Friends came to see us, Zosima says, middle of the page.

247
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,040
Dear ones, he would say to them, What have I done that you should love me so?

248
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,359
How can you love anybody like me?

249
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,119
And how was it I did not know I did not appreciate it before?

250
00:25:01,439 --> 00:25:06,399
When servants came to him, he would say continually, this is where you have to pay attention.

251
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:10,960
Christians will notice, Dear kind people, why are you doing so much for me?

252
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,959
Do I deserve to be waited on?

253
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,240
If it were God's will for me to live, I would wait on you, for all men should wait on one another.

254
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,959
Do you recognize Jesus washing the feet of Mary Magdalene, and so forth?

255
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,719
If you're, I mean, you have to know the New Testament, but if you don't, you have to take my word for it.

256
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:35,759
That's a kind of quote: that everybody will be servants of everybody, and even, you have to realize how weird this is.

257
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:54,759
Jesus is God, Marco is God, in some funny sense, and this God, instead of being super powerful, supreme being, or a kind of weirdly, weird, powerful Greek God, Greek gods don't go around washing the feet of human beings.

258
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,200
Neither does Jehovah.

259
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:04,199
It's just outrageous that God should be coming around serving and washing the feet of the servants.

260
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:16,119
But that's, and that's the Christian, that's the sign that what Markle has got is the same vision that Jesus had, and there it is, planted in there for you to see.

261
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,839
And then I'll go a little further.

262
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:24,520
Mother, darling, he would say, there must be servants and masters, but if so, I will be the servant of my servants.

263
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,720
And that's the crucial line.

264
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,439
It's not an important part of the existentializing, not at all.

265
00:26:32,439 --> 00:26:33,320
It's the clue.

266
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:46,520
It's in here because it's the clue about what's being existentialized, namely the incarnation of God, where it happens in this case for Dostoevsky, God is that all things are connected.

267
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,040
And Markle says it.

268
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,920
He says it goes beyond the Bible, I think, in saying it.

269
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:54,760
I've always thought it to him, I don't think Jesus ever says you should love the birds, does he?

270
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,120
And the animals.

271
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:56,359
St.

272
00:26:56,439 --> 00:26:58,679
Francis got that out of it somehow.

273
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,599
Where he found it, I don't know.

274
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,760
But Dostoevsky doesn't have to stay true to the Bible.

275
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,800
He has to just have the existential structure.

276
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,639
That, here's the point.

277
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:19,000
In a selfish world, nobody can just understand this kind of unselfish agape love.

278
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,800
It has to be brought in, so to speak, from outside and demonstrated.

279
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:42,879
And whoever brings it in from outside and demonstrates it is a God, is the incarnation of God, and they will be sort of overwhelmed by the power that they have once they have this love.

280
00:27:42,879 --> 00:27:48,079
And it's so overwhelming that they die of it in various ways.

281
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,599
They all go crazy.

282
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:51,199
They all die.

283
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,119
So, because, well, and I think I said just a second, huh?

284
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,239
Yeah, they're too crazy to live in the world.

285
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,999
Yeah, that's the Markle story.

286
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:14,800
Now, the question then becomes, and you should be asking it yourselves, or maybe I've sort of preempted it.

287
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:20,000
Well, how come Zosima and Aryasha and all these other Christians don't go crazy?

288
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,759
They're loving.

289
00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:28,800
Zosima gives all this talk about the flowers and the birds and the bees and the animals and how we all love each other.

290
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,999
And they seem perfectly, they don't need brain fever.

291
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,839
Well, that's important, all right.

292
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:35,200
That's the next stage.

293
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,399
I want to tell you now, Dostoevsky thinks Christianity comes in three stages.

294
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:45,919
I don't, he never says it in so many words, but he says it in lots of sort of asides and stuff.

295
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,560
And he clearly says it.

296
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,999
I'll read you passages.

297
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,839
And what are the three stages?

298
00:28:51,839 --> 00:29:11,480
Well, the first stage is there's this community of strange people around this completely strange character who are experiencing this supernatural love that comes into the world through him, and it's all too crazy for anybody to know what to do with it.

299
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:29,480
But what you have to do with it, and I already said this, you have to find a new language and new practices and new rituals and new institutions to preserve it and make it intelligible and make it manageable so it doesn't destroy the people like the idiot does.

300
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:37,159
Doesn't it destroy them by loving them in this overwhelming and unsort of controlled way?

301
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:40,200
Now, the question for you is: what is that?

302
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:52,040
What's in the book the example of the next stage of Christianity where it gets tamed and where people come to be able to talk about it and live it without being crazy?

303
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:54,120
How does that happen?

304
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,559
Where does that happen?

305
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,879
Huh?

306
00:29:58,999 --> 00:30:01,559
Do we find people talking about it and not being crazy?

307
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:02,039
Yeah, sure.

308
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,239
Zasima.

309
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,279
The elders.

310
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:45,239
In fact, the whole institution of elders is a kind of existentialized second stage where the message of Jesus is preserved, or the message of Markle too, it turns out, is preserved by taking it out of this ugly, sinful, violent, brutal, selfish world, finding a language for it, finding chants and prayers and confessions and all the stuff that you can use to sort of nurture this new experience and not let it destroy you and not let the world destroy it.

311
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,400
That's the second stage.

312
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:52,720
But we haven't, I mean, I'm not ready quite for the second stage.

313
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,559
At least put it on hold for a minute.

314
00:30:54,879 --> 00:31:01,839
Something important also happened that is another existentialized Christian thing.

315
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:12,800
This is a little bit magical, but not magical against the laws of physics and chemistry, but just sort of, I think Dostoevsky would say, mysterious.

316
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,240
But it's in the Bible.

317
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:24,000
He's going to demythologize the apostolic succession, that is the succession of bishops, the forming of the church.

318
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:34,399
Those again who know the Bible know that Jesus gives Peter, one of the disciples, the right to set up a church and to take confession and so forth.

319
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:48,160
He sort of gives him the job of institutionalizing Christianity, which hadn't yet become Christianity, but that's what his job is, to turn it into a manageable religion.

320
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:56,240
Well, it so happens that Marco also passed, and oh, and it happens, and this is sort of the seemingly magical part.

321
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:07,359
Peter lays his hands, sorry, Jesus lays his hands on Peter and gives him this power to found the church and sort of continue the love and so forth.

322
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:12,720
That's called the laying on of hands, and that's how the love is passed on.

323
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:21,120
And that does seem sort of, again, magical and mysterious how it gets passed on that way, but not against the laws of physics and chemistry.

324
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,239
Just strange.

325
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,239
But Dostoevsky has it.

326
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,480
There is a moment.

327
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:28,160
I said it wrong last time.

328
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:40,680
I said two or three times ago when Zosima picks up Alyasha at the vision that Alyasha has, after Zosima is dead, of Zosima at the feast of Cana.

329
00:32:40,999 --> 00:32:45,559
And I said, that's how this love thing gets passed on.

330
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:52,519
Remember, I said, like, Spock touches and gives it to McCoy at one point, and then McCoy begins to act like Spock.

331
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,680
So that's what's happening.

332
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,439
And it's the same sort of thing.

333
00:32:56,439 --> 00:33:00,359
It wasn't against the laws of physics and chemistry in Star Trek either, but it was pretty weird.

334
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:09,879
Anyway, what happens here is it happens not at that vision, because the vision would have been, you know, just a vision.

335
00:33:09,879 --> 00:33:27,160
It really happens that Marko passes on the love to Zosima by touching him and putting, I think, his hands on his shoulders and looking into his eyes on 279.

336
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,599
About two-thirds down.

337
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:32,839
I remember I once went into his room when there was no one else there.

338
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:34,520
It was a bright evening.

339
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:37,879
Notice the sun was setting and the whole room was lighted up.

340
00:33:37,879 --> 00:33:45,320
Whenever you get in touch with all the threads connecting the world, it's always the slanting rays of the setting sun.

341
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,719
It's never the sun at noon.

342
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,680
So there it is.

343
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,359
He beckons me and I went up to him.

344
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:55,080
He put his hands on my shoulders and looked into my face tenderly, lovingly.

345
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,120
He said nothing for a minute, only looked at me like that.

346
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,599
Well, he said, finally, run and play now.

347
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,959
Enjoy life, too.

348
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,240
That's how Mark passes this on.

349
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,200
And it's like, I mean, it's not utterly mysterious.

350
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,879
It's a childhood memory.

351
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:25,999
It's in the same business as how Alyasha got held up to the icon and it made a lasting influence and he went to the monastery, how Dimitri got the nuts from the doctor, and that made him a loving person too, and so forth.

352
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:35,600
So at this point, Markle is giving Zosima an experience which will make Zosima a loving person.

353
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,320
But it takes a long time to take effect.

354
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:41,280
That's the next thing.

355
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,399
So he passes the love on to Zosima.

356
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,520
I just read that.

357
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:46,239
Okay.

358
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:57,439
And you see, Zosima says going on, I went out then to play, and many times in my life afterwards, I remembered even with tears how he had told me to enjoy life for him.

359
00:34:57,439 --> 00:35:01,839
But it's the childhood memory which is now going to come back and guide him.

360
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:02,800
It's the finger.

361
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:10,800
He's now sort of got the finger that's going to point him into the monastery when Markle does this to him.

362
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,439
So now let's see.

363
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:28,400
So Markle has now opened up a new relation to God as connectedness, and he experiences this love in an unbearable ecstasy.

364
00:35:28,399 --> 00:35:31,839
It's too deep and too impersonal for him to live it.

365
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:36,560
But then Zosima gets a kind of ordination from him.

366
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:42,879
And that's the, and he now passes it on to Alyasha.

367
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:44,560
Only I don't see where.

368
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,439
Interesting.

369
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:52,160
I hope it's on page 84, because if it isn't, I have no idea where it is.

370
00:35:52,479 --> 00:35:53,760
Yeah, there he is.

371
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,280
And he puts his hand, I think, on him, let's hope.

372
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:06,280
On 84, Zosima says, remember my words about three lines down and so forth.

373
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,720
And then he says, you're going to leave the monastery.

374
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,079
Leave me.

375
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:11,879
I must pray.

376
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:12,599
Go hurry.

377
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:14,359
Be with your brothers.

378
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:19,320
And not near only one only, but near both.

379
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,760
Faza Zosima raised his hands to bless him.

380
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:28,519
That's the moment when Zosima passes it on to him, the love that's going to...

381
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:36,120
What you want is that God's love comes through one person who passes it on to another person who passes it on to another person.

382
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,240
But of course, you're not going to transform the world that way.

383
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,800
Somebody's got to pass it on to a lot of people.

384
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:49,559
And you might, you can look at your chart if you want at this point, and you can see what's happening there.

385
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:57,080
The side of the chart called the chain of love, not the onion, but the one where Alyasha is in the center.

386
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,280
I don't have a copy, but you've got any extra ones?

387
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:00,920
Yeah.

388
00:37:03,879 --> 00:37:08,679
Okay, so you can see the succession we're talking about, the apostolic succession.

389
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,800
But I would have been writing on the board if I knew how to write on the board.

390
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,359
So there you get the God field of connectedness.

391
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:16,520
Mark's the incarnation of it.

392
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:18,280
Now, we don't know yet about the onion.

393
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:19,560
We'll get there in a minute.

394
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:24,359
It goes from Zosima to Alyasha, which we just read on page 84.

395
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:27,640
And from Alyasha, it spreads to all those people.

396
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:32,600
And it's no longer a sort of private thing that the church has.

397
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,519
Everybody can get it, and anybody can pass it on.

398
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,879
It's gotten even further existentialized.

399
00:37:39,879 --> 00:37:42,519
I mean, it was a private property of the bishops.

400
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:53,920
I mean, probably some of you know the difference between the Episcopal Church and the Roman Catholic Church is that the Roman Catholics claim to have been in the direct line of the laying on of hands since Peter.

401
00:37:53,919 --> 00:38:02,879
But they claim that the Episcopal lost it when they broke with the Roman Catholic Church, and their bishops aren't really challenging channeling this love.

402
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:08,400
And Dostoevsky would find all that too magical to be interesting to him.

403
00:38:08,399 --> 00:38:24,879
But what is interesting to him is that you've got to have, I think, through the child, through the special experiences, the kind of passing on, which he's showing you in this scene with Brother Mark.

404
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,279
Now, what happens?

405
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,359
Well, it's sort of like a time bomb.

406
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,359
It doesn't go off immediately.

407
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:39,600
Zosima doesn't walk out of Markle's sick room and immediately become a loving Christian.

408
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,960
Far from it.

409
00:38:40,959 --> 00:38:43,119
You remember the Dostoevsky picture?

410
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:53,520
Why couldn't he just walk out of there and start loving the birds and the trees and everybody in total openness and complete channel for agape love?

411
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:55,679
Why would that not work?

412
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:57,679
Yeah.

413
00:39:03,439 --> 00:39:04,479
Exactly.

414
00:39:04,479 --> 00:39:05,199
That's right.

415
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,719
I mean, that's the problem of the idiot.

416
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:14,320
The idiot is like somebody who just got brain fever, got whacked by this whole new way of looking at the world, and didn't help anybody.

417
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,439
So what happens with Zosima?

418
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:19,359
He becomes a bad guy.

419
00:39:19,919 --> 00:39:25,040
And that's on page 285.

420
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,320
He learns the dark side, as you put it, the middle of 285.

421
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,439
I spent a long time, almost eight years in the military school in Petersburg.

422
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:40,039
It's always the army that is the dark side.

423
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:47,479
In these new surroundings, many of my childish impressions grew dimmer, though I forgot nothing.

424
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:54,920
I picked up so many new habits and opinions that I was transformed into a cruel, absurd, almost savage creature.

425
00:39:54,919 --> 00:39:56,999
I worry about the word transformed there.

426
00:39:56,999 --> 00:40:03,720
I hope there are two Russian words, one for change and one for transform, because changed is what it would be.

427
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:13,879
Transformed ought to be saved for being reborn, a new, loving being, instead of a natural, selfish sinful being.

428
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:21,240
And that's so, so if I had a Russian, I've never yet found the right Russian person to tell me.

429
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:25,240
So I would, instead of transform, just put in change.

430
00:40:25,399 --> 00:40:31,640
I bet those, even if the Russian word, even if there's only one Russian word, I bet it has both meanings.

431
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,399
And there is, and you've just got to keep these two meanings separate.

432
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:38,200
You could translate it the other way, too.

433
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,920
The transform seems more total.

434
00:40:40,919 --> 00:40:49,320
Anyway, he got changed into, socialized into, a cruel, absurd, almost strange creature.

435
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,799
And then, and he becomes really, really bad.

436
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:58,120
I mean, he becomes brutal on 287.

437
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,720
He's got to experience all this dark forces in people.

438
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:13,720
On 287, in the middle of the page, in the evening, returning home in a savage and brutal humor, I flew into a rage with my orderly and gave him two blows in the face with all my might so that it was covered with blood.

439
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,440
Well, that's pretty brutal.

440
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:27,279
But by the bottom of the page, the sort of power of love that has been planted in him by Markle suddenly flowers and takes over.

441
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:30,159
At the bottom of the page, I hid my face in my hands.

442
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,719
I fell on my bed and I broke into a storm of tears.

443
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:38,799
And then I remembered my brother Markle and what he said on his deathbed to his servants: My dear ones, why do you wait on me?

444
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,919
Why do you love me?

445
00:41:39,919 --> 00:41:41,760
Am I where's your waiting on me?

446
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:53,839
So he gets the Christian message and he gets the Christian love that's been put in him by this laying on of hands and looking him in the eye and demonstrating the love.

447
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:06,640
And so Zosima then goes to a duel, but he's already been transformed, so he doesn't shoot.

448
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:20,639
He throws away his gun and he says, two-thirds of the way on 289, Gentlemen, I cried suddenly, speaking straight from my heart, look around you at the gifts of God, the clear air, sky, the pure air, the tender grass, the birds.

449
00:42:20,879 --> 00:42:24,079
He's being sort of taken over by Markle.

450
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,760
Nature is beautiful and sinless, and we only, we are sinful and foolish.

451
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,920
And we don't understand that life is heaven.

452
00:42:29,919 --> 00:42:35,999
We have only to understand that, and it will be once, and it will at once be fulfilled in its beauty.

453
00:42:35,999 --> 00:42:38,000
We shall embrace each other and weep.

454
00:42:37,999 --> 00:42:40,160
Well, that's exactly what Markle said.

455
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,160
And that's what now Zosima is saying.

456
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:47,839
And we've heard Zosima saying it every once in a while, but now we know how come he's saying it.

457
00:42:47,839 --> 00:43:04,879
He's saying it because he got it from Markle, and he's able to say it without going crazy, because for 2,000 years, the second stage of Christianity has preserved it in a way that is manageable.

458
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:15,879
So I'm just catching up with where I am.

459
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,959
Jumping on 310.

460
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,359
Well, Zosima, it's complicated here.

461
00:43:38,359 --> 00:43:41,240
I don't even know whether I want to say it.

462
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:49,239
In the middle stage of Christianity, of course, it's not existentialized.

463
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:54,120
It's put in very religious symbols.

464
00:43:54,120 --> 00:44:04,920
So, Zosima, who's in the second stage, still believes in a God who is a supreme being and accepts Platonic philosophy.

465
00:44:04,919 --> 00:44:08,199
Dostoevsky's making a criticism of the church.

466
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:12,120
He thinks that in the original Christian community, it wasn't like that.

467
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:18,280
And once the church is sort of surmounted, it won't be like that.

468
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:24,120
And the symbol of the church being left behind, so to speak, is Alyasha leaving the monastery.

469
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:33,000
The love of Marko, which gets institutionalized as Christian love in the monasteries, finally goes out into the world.

470
00:44:32,999 --> 00:44:38,839
And it's very interesting, but you've got to read very subtly to see how it gets changed.

471
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:45,320
Here's Zosima still being Christian and using the Christian language.

472
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:52,080
He says, the middle of the page of 310, my friends, pray to God for gladness.

473
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:56,080
I mean, praying, you can't really pray to the interconnectedness of it.

474
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:57,839
I don't think Dostoevsky, I'll show you.

475
00:44:57,999 --> 00:45:02,879
I don't think Dostoevsky thinks praying is the appropriate thing to do.

476
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:10,159
What the appropriate thing to do is to love people and love the one you're with, whoever the neighbor is that needs it.

477
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:13,040
So let's go at the bottom of 310.

478
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:25,200
Zosima says, on earth indeed, we are, as it were, astray, and if it were not for the precious image of Christ before us, we should be undone and altogether lost.

479
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:37,520
And that, well, you can read it, you can either read it as he's still thinking of this in two sort of symbolic terms, or you can see that he's got the feel for it.

480
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:43,519
That if it weren't for the, but he doesn't say if it weren't for Markle, I'd be entirely lost.

481
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:48,000
He's put it in universal Christian terms there.

482
00:45:47,999 --> 00:45:58,080
And then it gets, so to speak, I would want to say worse, finally, from a Dostoevsky point of view, because it's getting all too much tied up with philosophy.

483
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:06,000
He says, much on earth is hidden from us, but to make up for that, we have been given a precious mystic sense of our living bond with the other world.

484
00:46:05,999 --> 00:46:07,280
The other world.

485
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,320
There's all these worlds, and they're all interconnected.

486
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:14,400
There is no the other world with the higher heavenly world.

487
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:20,399
Well, the higher heavenly world is here on earth, according to Markle and according to the mysterious visitor.

488
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,799
We are in paradise now.

489
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,040
We are in heaven now, if we would only see it.

490
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:26,559
Zosima is sort of losing it.

491
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,600
Higher heavenly world, and the roots of our thought and feelings are not here, but in other worlds.

492
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,000
That's okay if you hear it right.

493
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:38,439
That is why the philosophers say that we can't understand the reality of things on earth.

494
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,959
Well, that's Plato.

495
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:47,879
That what's real is something spiritual and eternal, and what's on earth are just reflections and imitations.

496
00:46:47,879 --> 00:46:54,359
Zosima, I was going to say Zosima shouldn't be talking that way, but that's probably I shouldn't be talking that way.

497
00:46:54,359 --> 00:47:03,879
Because Zosima should be talking that way, because that's what you have to do when you take over this experience and try to make it intelligible.

498
00:47:03,879 --> 00:47:18,440
So the church goes around for 2,000 years, putting the Christian message into, maybe not 2,000, 1,500 anyway, putting the Christian message into Platonic form, and Zosima is part of that.

499
00:47:18,439 --> 00:47:28,839
He isn't doing it as badly as the Roman Catholic Church is doing it, Dostoevsky would say, because the Russian Orthodox Church always preserves more of the original Christian community.

500
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:30,759
But Zosima hasn't got it.

501
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,879
He got it right, but he's a necessary stage.

502
00:47:33,879 --> 00:47:39,160
He's the second stage in the three-stage Christian thing.

503
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:50,839
There has to be the incarnation where the love comes into this natural world and destroys the people who bring it in because it's so powerful and ecstatic.

504
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:59,559
There has to be the stage in which it withdraws into the monastery to be preserved and then it can go someplace else.

505
00:47:59,959 --> 00:48:02,600
I'm still talking about the monastery.

506
00:48:07,959 --> 00:48:11,800
So the church fathers had to make up a whole story.

507
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,400
For instance, the Trinity.

508
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,119
There's no mention of the Trinity in the New Testament.

509
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:20,439
There's sometimes a one God, and sometimes a two God, and sometimes a three God.

510
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:25,680
They had to work it out, make it consistent, and make it something you could understand.

511
00:48:25,919 --> 00:48:30,800
It's pretty mysterious anyway, but they had an account of it.

512
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,879
And they have to make it livable.

513
00:48:32,879 --> 00:48:48,720
That is, they have to make it so that through, as I say, practices of love and devotion and shared property and shared confessions, you can actually live in a way that's in touch with this kind of love.

514
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,839
And they do all that.

515
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:50,960
And that's good.

516
00:48:50,959 --> 00:48:52,560
It just isn't good enough.

517
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:57,600
Because remember in the background that Vostievsky says the star will rise in the east.

518
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:02,000
That means that finally the Russian Orthodox Church is going to save the world.

519
00:49:01,999 --> 00:49:10,560
And it's certainly not going to save the world if they all stay in monasteries and talk this kind of Platonic talk about the other world that Zossimeth does.

520
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:13,599
Now, I'm looking for something which I don't see here.

521
00:49:16,879 --> 00:49:19,759
But I know we don't really need it.

522
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:43,839
But remember now, the crucial thing to read is any passage which tells you that institutionalized Christianity, which is represented here by the monastery, is a safe place where you don't have to go crazy and you don't have to fight off all these brutish people.

523
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:46,879
That's what he says on the bottom of 303.

524
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:55,680
And then this is a summing up of stage two, the top paragraph, the end of it.

525
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,240
Meanwhile, in their solitude, these are the monks.

526
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:02,800
They keep the image of Christ fair and undefiled in the purity of God's truth.

527
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,800
See, all that's still pretty much Christian, unexistentialized talk.

528
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:12,280
From the times of the fathers of old, the church fathers, the apostles and the martyrs.

529
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:16,120
And when the time comes, they will show it to the tottering creeds of the world.

530
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,720
That is the great thought.

531
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,600
That star will rise in the east.

532
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:25,800
So now we need to know what the third stage looks like.

533
00:50:26,359 --> 00:50:27,239
And that's it.

534
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:33,320
The third stage is going to be when this love leaves the monastery.

535
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:37,400
So we readers are in on the third stage.

536
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:55,960
What's happening with Alyasha and what's happening with Dostoevsky writing the Brothers Karamatsov and you guys reading it and being existentialized is the third stage, where it's something that any human being, you don't have to be in the West and you don't have to be in the Christian church.

537
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:07,640
Dostoevsky wants to find universal human experiences that this Christian church has found and preserved and is now ready to go out in the world.

538
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:17,480
So the answer to Alyasha, why didn't Alyasha go crazy when he had this mystical experience of all connectedness and loving the animals and the birds and everything?

539
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:32,760
Because he was had, because the whole Christian, because for 1,500 years, the Christian community had been finding a language for it and rituals for it so that you could do it without being crazy.

540
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,080
And that was a very important stage.

541
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,480
But now we're ready for the third stage.

542
00:51:37,479 --> 00:51:46,839
So the love that goes from Marko to Zosima, you have it on your chart, goes to Alyasha, and then it goes to the whole, it spreads to the world.

543
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:54,320
He brings the he he okay, let's put it that way.

544
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:14,960
And Zosima not only ordains Alyasha, that is, puts his hands on him and puts him in the succession of bishops, but instead of making him the next elder, he sends him out into the world.

545
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,760
And that's what he does on 83.

546
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:20,879
I've read this once before, I think.

547
00:52:20,879 --> 00:52:22,239
Ten lines from the bottom.

548
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,239
When it is God's will to call me, leave the monastery, go away for good.

549
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,680
Alyasha started.

550
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,240
What is it?

551
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,839
This is not your place for the time.

552
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:32,479
I bless you for great service in the world.

553
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,119
And Christ be with you.

554
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:38,240
Don't abandon him, and he'll not abandon you.

555
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,839
Well, we know that means, in effect, Mark will be with you.

556
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:48,719
And don't lose the memory of Zosima, who's got the memory of Markle, which is guiding them.

557
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:52,160
Now we know who the mysterious visitor, the mysterious finger is.

558
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:57,920
It's always Marko's love coming to them as childhood memories.

559
00:52:57,919 --> 00:52:59,520
It's guiding them.

560
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:04,879
And it's the existentialized Christ guiding them.

561
00:53:04,879 --> 00:53:09,359
And so that's fine.

562
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:30,400
So Markle's truth, that his experience, which has been symbolized and Christianized by the monks, will be existentialized and brought into the world in a transforming but completely livable form.

563
00:53:30,399 --> 00:53:38,119
Everybody will be able to love everybody and live in a kind of big bunch of Christian hippie communes.

564
00:53:38,839 --> 00:53:46,600
Remember, the story is not that the church will become the state, but that the state will become the church.

565
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,920
That is, we'll have Christian socialism.

566
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,520
That's what he's saying is going to happen.

567
00:53:52,519 --> 00:54:06,759
That means not that it gets secularized, that's the enlightenment, where you change, you believe in reason and science, and you think you can organize the world to satisfy everybody's needs and makes them happy.

568
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,680
That's the Grand Inquisitive.

569
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:11,560
But instead, it gets existentialized.

570
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:23,320
It becomes a supernatural, non-rational experience of love, and people go out and do it.

571
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:27,879
Now come these interesting little touches that I mentioned already.

572
00:54:27,879 --> 00:54:32,520
Alyasha only becomes effective when he leaves the monastery.

573
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:35,480
He doesn't help anybody, I think.

574
00:54:35,479 --> 00:54:36,279
I hope.

575
00:54:36,519 --> 00:54:40,200
I don't remember any place where he does any transformation.

576
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,479
He only transforms Grushenko once he's been told to leave the monastery.

577
00:54:43,479 --> 00:54:48,120
He hasn't sort of officially packed his suitcase and left, but he's decided to leave.

578
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:52,280
He's outside the monastery and he's doing his first miracle.

579
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:58,520
And he is sort of changed in an interesting way.

580
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:02,040
On 178, he looks altogether different.

581
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:08,000
He apparently, monks apparently had long hair and silk trousers, and it says two-thirds of the way down.

582
00:55:07,999 --> 00:55:12,199
Monk in silk trousers, cried the boy, following Alyasha.

583
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:20,599
So while he was in the monastery, the boys, who turn out to be important later, sort of ridiculed him.

584
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,839
He seemed to them.

585
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:26,559
But when he gets out of the monastery, they don't ridicule him anymore.

586
00:55:26,879 --> 00:55:33,920
And he turns out to be sort of a very good-looking young guy on 505.

587
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,600
The bottom, 505.

588
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:50,160
We may note here that Alyasha's appearance had undergone a complete change.

589
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,760
That's nicer than transformation.

590
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,640
I hope it would be nice if that was a different word.

591
00:55:54,640 --> 00:56:04,080
Since we saw him last, he had abandoned his cassock and was now wearing a well-cut coat, a soft round hat, and his hair was cropped short.

592
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:07,280
All this was very becoming, and he looked quite handsome.

593
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,760
Well, there's a new Alyasha.

594
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:19,839
You can ask yourself, in the funny way that Dostoevsky is playing around with this, where did he get these fancy clothes, which must have cost a lot of money?

595
00:56:19,999 --> 00:56:21,040
You know?

596
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:22,320
You don't know.

597
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,080
I don't think there's any answer.

598
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:31,040
I think Dostoevsky is demonstrating that we know that Alyasha will always find people who are happy to take care of him.

599
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:33,999
And somebody or other was happy to buy him his clothes.

600
00:56:33,999 --> 00:56:35,119
Maybe his father.

601
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,080
I don't know.

602
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:43,680
But he's now, anyway, a completely handsome, secular, not secularized, remember, that's the Enlightenment.

603
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,479
But there's no word for it.

604
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,760
He's now Christian love out in the world.

605
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,239
He's the apostolic succession arriving at its conclusion.

606
00:56:55,519 --> 00:56:59,920
Okay, that gets us to the onion chain.

607
00:56:59,919 --> 00:57:06,079
The onion chain is the story of how this love does go out into the world.

608
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:17,079
And it's just an amazing and beautiful story, which I can't tell you all about until the very end of the book, where Dostios pulls off a big tour de force.

609
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,759
We can read some of it.

610
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,600
We should notice.

611
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,160
that.

612
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:40,040
Now let's just go, I'll go through the current supernatural love, which comes up, it comes out of Markle, Dezosima, Talyasha, goes to Grushenka, and she then becomes capable of self-respect and love.

613
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:47,080
And she, instead of going off at the pole, she loves Dimitri, and she's one of the people who inherit the love.

614
00:57:47,080 --> 00:58:01,720
And she's also the person who tells a story, which is absolutely perfect for expressing this way, that this love goes through somebody and then out into the world on 339.

615
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,559
We've got to read the whole thing.

616
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:08,599
I mean, it's amazing.

617
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:13,480
I don't know what luck for Dostoevsky somehow finding this parable.

618
00:58:13,479 --> 00:58:18,039
Because this parable is the story of the love going out into the world.

619
00:58:18,039 --> 00:58:19,720
And it's in this chart.

620
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:24,600
So about two-thirds, about one-third of the way down on 339.

621
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:31,160
Once upon a time, there was a peasant woman, and a very wicked woman she was, and she died and did not leave a single good deed behind.

622
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,960
The devils caught her and plunged her into a lake.

623
00:58:33,959 --> 00:58:39,320
So her guardian angel stood and wondered what good deed of hers, he could remember to tell God.

624
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:44,759
Remember that Dimitri says that God and the devil are fighting for the soul of man.

625
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:52,479
Every person has a God, or it really turns out to be an angel, an angel and a devil fighting for their soul.

626
00:58:52,479 --> 00:58:54,560
You see that on the other side of this hand.

627
00:58:50,999 --> 00:58:57,039
But I haven't got, we haven't quite got there yet.

628
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:04,160
You can actually map out who is the angel and who is the devil fighting for each of the characters in the book.

629
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:14,000
The angel is trying to bring out the best in them and make them able to be Christian or not even Christian, post-Christian, let's call it, and blissful, loving.

630
00:59:13,999 --> 00:59:24,320
And the devil is trying to bring out their insecurity and their despair and put them in a situation where everything they do will be destructive of them and everybody else, like Rakitin.

631
00:59:24,399 --> 00:59:29,119
The Rakitin and Alyasha fighting over Grushenka is typical.

632
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:36,320
But it turns out that in every case, the devil and the angel, and in most cases, I'm not sure about everyone, but I'll show you.

633
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:47,680
You always are told by Gostoevsky in so many words who is the devil and who is the angel, in this particular instance, fighting over this particular person.

634
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:51,200
But I can't tell you that yet, for one thing, you've got further to read.

635
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,639
Okay, so here's this woman.

636
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:57,760
She once pulled up an onion in her garden, he said, and gave it to a beggar woman.

637
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:04,080
And God answered, You take that onion in, hold it out to her in the lake, and let her take hold of it and be pulled out.

638
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,879
And if you can pull her out of the lake, let her come to paradise.

639
01:00:06,879 --> 01:00:09,839
But if the onion breaks, then the woman must stay where she is.

640
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:13,199
The angel ran to the woman and hailed out the onion to her.

641
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,240
Come, said he, catch hold and I'll pull you out.

642
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,400
And he began cautiously pulling her out.

643
01:00:18,399 --> 01:00:25,600
He had just about pulled her out when the other sinners in the lake, seeing how she was being drawn out, caught hold of her so as to be pulled out with her.

644
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:28,879
But she was a very wicked woman and she began kicking them off.

645
01:00:28,879 --> 01:00:30,639
I'm to be pulled out, not you.

646
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,560
It's my onion, not yours.

647
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:38,040
As soon as she said that, the onion broke and she'd go back into the lake, and she is burning there to this day.

648
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:43,079
Well, up to the end, Alyasha is like the onion, except, or like the woman.

649
01:00:43,399 --> 01:00:46,120
Well, no, sorry, Zasima is like the onion.

650
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:51,320
He's the way to pull everybody out by pulling Alyasha out.

651
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:52,839
I'm back with my chart.

652
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:56,680
But Alyasha, unlike the woman, isn't kicking all these people off.

653
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:57,879
He's taking them all on.

654
01:00:57,959 --> 01:01:06,440
Wushenka, Dimitri, the boys who haven't come across yet, Ilusha, who haven't come across yet, or Kolya, all these people who you're about to read about over vacation.

655
01:01:06,439 --> 01:01:15,640
Alyasha's helping them all come out of the bad world into the super world.

656
01:01:15,959 --> 01:01:17,160
So let's see now.

657
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,359
Anyone want to say anything?

658
01:01:18,359 --> 01:01:21,320
I've been talking and talking because there's so much interesting stuff to say.

659
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,359
But yeah, good.

660
01:01:22,359 --> 01:01:23,720
Say something.

661
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,039
Yeah.

662
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:32,839
Tell me more.

663
01:01:59,879 --> 01:02:01,559
He loses her back into.

664
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:02,119
Yeah.

665
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:08,039
Well, it has a common structure, but I think sort of the message is so different.

666
01:02:08,039 --> 01:02:10,760
I mean, he doesn't look back out of selfishness exactly.

667
01:02:11,879 --> 01:02:17,320
But anyway, don't bring it up because a lot of people don't know it, and we'd have to know the context more.

668
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,400
Anybody else want to say anything?

669
01:02:20,359 --> 01:02:21,680
Okay, let's go on then.

670
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:27,440
We still have time to complete the first pass of the onion chain.

671
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:31,040
So Alyasha doesn't kick the others off.

672
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:34,400
He pulls them all out, except for Yvonne.

673
01:02:34,399 --> 01:02:36,159
He pulls them all out into a better world.

674
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:41,359
Whether he ever doesn't manage to pull Yvonne out in this book, maybe he does in the next book.

675
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:42,560
We don't know.

676
01:02:43,439 --> 01:02:56,239
He pulls them out of the selfish world into the loving one, out of the Eros world into the Agape world, from the hell of selfishness and isolation into the heaven of selfless love.

677
01:02:56,559 --> 01:03:00,879
And that fits with what Dimitri says on 118.

678
01:03:00,879 --> 01:03:03,200
I said it, but I show it to you.

679
01:03:03,919 --> 01:03:05,119
No, I won't.

680
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,199
No, I don't have it on 118.

681
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,760
Well, oh, because it's on 112.

682
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:23,839
So Dimitri just says, sort of out of nowhere at the bottom of that long speech, God and the devil are fighting there, and the battlefield is the heart of man.

683
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:28,320
So this now gets turned out into the angel and the devil are fighting.

684
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,960
And the battlefield is each person.

685
01:03:30,959 --> 01:03:34,879
And that's what Dostevsky is going to show you.

686
01:03:34,879 --> 01:03:40,240
And now we can just go and look at some of them.

687
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:44,399
So let's, we've done Grushenko already, just to review real fast.

688
01:03:45,039 --> 01:04:00,079
So Rakitin is the devil fighting, trying to bring Grushenka down, make her go to her pole, this Polish lover, either like a dog or with a knife, both of which will be disastrous and destructive for her and the Polish lover.

689
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:08,119
And she gets another possibility, and Rakitin still goes around saying the devil only knows as it's happening.

690
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:11,879
And she says every once in a while to Alyasha, I'm so glad you've come, you angel.

691
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,039
And the angel wins.

692
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:21,879
And then Grushenka goes off to her lover and just says, I'm not interested, and goes off with Dmitry.

693
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:29,719
So a weird, complicated one is the struggle over Lisa.

694
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:40,200
The person who is the bad person over Lisa, bringing out her sadistic, self-destructive side, who's that?

695
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,799
We've seen that.

696
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:42,920
Is Yvonne.

697
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:51,559
She writes a letter to Yvonne when she wants to tell him about her crucifix, her thinking about the crucified child and eating her pineapple compost.

698
01:04:51,559 --> 01:04:53,719
And he comes and says, That's very nice.

699
01:04:53,719 --> 01:04:56,039
And she says, Did he despise me?

700
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:58,119
And she wants to be told yes.

701
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:01,959
She wants to be despised by Yvonne and so forth.

702
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:06,919
So Yvonne is definitely trying to bring out the worst in her, or doesn't even have to try.

703
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,359
You don't have to try.

704
01:05:08,359 --> 01:05:13,879
These devils and angels do what they do, often without even knowing they're doing it.

705
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:19,719
There's a sense in which Alyasha plays the role of devil with Grushenka.

706
01:05:19,719 --> 01:05:22,119
There's sort of two Alyashas in that sense.

707
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:33,639
The Alyasha, who's in the monastery, he is the one who brings Grushenka down to the despair that leads her to this move, bad move of going to the pole with a knife or like a dog.

708
01:05:33,639 --> 01:05:35,639
Remember how he does it.

709
01:05:35,639 --> 01:05:36,759
Remember?

710
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,879
She, remember, he won't look at her.

711
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:46,759
And she thinks that he is this person she admires so much, and she is such a slut, he won't even look at her.

712
01:05:46,759 --> 01:05:51,119
And that is what's driving her to despair, she says.

713
01:05:50,599 --> 01:05:54,799
So there's Yvonne playing the devil role without even knowing it.

714
01:05:50,759 --> 01:05:57,679
And I bet there are people playing the angel role without even knowing it.

715
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,519
I don't know.

716
01:05:59,519 --> 01:06:04,639
I mean, let's see if I can, such a big book to run through just like this, but let me try.

717
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:18,000
Maybe Grushenka is for Dmitri.

718
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,320
Do I have, after all, I should look at my chart.

719
01:06:20,399 --> 01:06:27,679
There are any of these people who are the angel ones, who are the playing, doing what they're doing without knowing if they're doing it.

720
01:06:27,679 --> 01:06:31,040
Grushenka is doing her angel job with Dmitri.

721
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,599
I don't know if she knows she's doing it or not.

722
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:39,120
See, on my chart, Alyasha is the devil for Grushenka and the angel for Grushenka.

723
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:44,160
That's the sort of pre, that's the pre- and post-monastery Alyasha.

724
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:51,439
One is in the monastery, he's so afraid of her that he's playing the devil role without knowing it.

725
01:06:51,439 --> 01:06:55,119
And after the monastery, he's saving her.

726
01:06:55,120 --> 01:07:05,519
Does anybody you'll see later, I think, that Ilusha is playing the angel role to the boys, and he doesn't know.

727
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:10,959
Most of the people happen to know it, but it doesn't matter whether they know it.

728
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:16,719
It's the function of what they're doing to these people or for these people that matters.

729
01:07:16,719 --> 01:07:25,200
So Yvonne's influence is to bring out the sadistic side of Lisa, 553.

730
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:52,679
So here it's all this crazy stuff I was summarizing where she once, where she says that the middle of 353, when he went out laughing, Yvonne did, I felt it was nice to be despised.

731
01:07:52,679 --> 01:07:56,519
The child with fingers cut off is nice, and to be despised is nice.

732
01:07:56,519 --> 01:07:59,799
And she laughed in Alyasha's face, a feverish, malicious laugh.

733
01:07:59,799 --> 01:08:00,839
Do you know Alyasha?

734
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:10,919
Do you know I would like, I think that means I would like Yvonne to come and totally despise her and maybe hurt her and so forth.

735
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:14,759
And Alyasha says, and then she says, Alyasha, save me.

736
01:08:14,759 --> 01:08:23,160
So there's clearly the side of him, the fact that she wants him to save her.

737
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:32,759
What's interesting on these pages, these are probably after you've stopped way beyond what you've read, but it's nothing about the plot being given away.

738
01:08:32,759 --> 01:08:35,240
But, and I won't even tell you, I guess, about it.

739
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:48,359
There's, you can ask yourself when you get there, what is it about Alyasha's dark side that enables him to have enough empathy for Lisa to be able to save her?

740
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:58,040
Because if he's too nice, he's not going to explain her kinky, really crazy story of, well, well, I'll tell you this crazy story.

741
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:01,879
She's dreaming of devils on the bottom of 551.

742
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:05,320
And she gets them all to crowd around at the bottom.

743
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:07,080
And they want to come and grab me.

744
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:08,359
They are just coming.

745
01:09:08,359 --> 01:09:10,359
But suddenly I cross myself.

746
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:12,999
They go away, stand in the corner.

747
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,879
And then I have a frightful longing to revile God.

748
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:16,599
And so I begin.

749
01:09:16,599 --> 01:09:19,320
And then the devils come back, delighted to grab me.

750
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:21,519
And I cross myself again, and they draw back.

751
01:09:21,519 --> 01:09:22,719
It's awful fun.

752
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:24,160
It takes one's breath away.

753
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:32,799
It's deep to try to figure out how that's related to her problems about the dark side of herself, but it surely is somehow.

754
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:35,039
And the next line is the amazing one.

755
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:38,160
I've had the same dream too, said Ali.

756
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:42,320
So he's got a problem with devils too.

757
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:53,519
And of course, it's because both of them haven't integrated the sensual side of themselves.

758
01:09:53,519 --> 01:10:04,240
But anyway, so he shares her dark side, her problem with her sexuality, and he has a similar problem with his sexuality.

759
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:07,599
And both of them are dreaming of devils.

760
01:10:07,599 --> 01:10:17,280
Now, I wanted to say one more thing about prayer just at the end because I've got only one minute.

761
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:21,679
But it's interesting if you look at it, that I want to show the three stages.

762
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:25,599
I'm going to summarize the three stages by showing what they think about prayer.

763
01:10:25,599 --> 01:10:29,679
Markle prays to the birds, but there's no mention of God.

764
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:33,280
And he prays to the birds in the sense of asking them to forgive him.

765
01:10:33,359 --> 01:10:41,759
Zosima prays to God as a person that connects people to others and asks him to intercede and help people, like on 309.

766
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:47,599
In other words, the normal Christian relation to God, which expects Osima to have.

767
01:10:47,599 --> 01:11:05,280
So on 309, he says, I hope.

768
01:11:05,599 --> 01:11:12,999
Okay, yes, at the top, you're supposed to pray to God to help people.

769
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:17,240
And God will look on you both more graciously.

770
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,919
This is about a third of the way down.

771
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:25,479
For if you have such pity on him, how much more will he have pity who is infinitely more loving and merciful than you?

772
01:11:25,479 --> 01:11:28,839
Who is this one with pity, infinitely merciful and more loving?

773
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:33,639
Well, in Zosima, it's God, God, the Supreme Being.

774
01:11:33,639 --> 01:11:38,200
That's because he's in the church stage, and God is for him like a person.

775
01:11:38,519 --> 01:11:44,599
But for Alyasha, interestingly enough, God is not like that.

776
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:47,399
But I don't see where I say so in my notes.

777
01:11:48,759 --> 01:11:50,359
Alyasha, here we are.

778
01:11:50,759 --> 01:11:56,679
Last thing we'll read on 174 or 160, or maybe both.

779
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,879
I have to look and see which one I want to read.

780
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,519
160.

781
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:18,919
So when Alyasha prays, he doesn't pray to all the creatures to forgive him, which was the pre-church version.

782
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:25,479
And he doesn't pray to God, the loving, forgiving Jesus or Supreme Being.

783
01:12:25,479 --> 01:12:28,439
He does a different thing at the bottom of 158.

784
01:12:28,439 --> 01:12:32,759
As a rule, every evening after services, the monks flomped into the cell.

785
01:12:32,759 --> 01:12:33,559
Where is it?

786
01:12:33,559 --> 01:12:34,359
Uh-oh.

787
01:12:34,679 --> 01:12:35,639
What have I got?

788
01:12:36,599 --> 01:12:39,399
160, I'm supposed to say.

789
01:12:39,399 --> 01:12:40,759
160.

790
01:12:42,599 --> 01:12:43,399
The very middle.

791
01:12:43,399 --> 01:12:52,479
He thirsted for the joyous emotion which always visited his soul after the praise and adoration of which his evening prayer usually consisted.

792
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:54,960
The joy always brought him untroubled sleep.

793
01:12:55,200 --> 01:13:00,719
He's not praying to God to help people the way Zasima is, as if God could intervene.

794
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:13,759
He's praying to God as that joyous experience that he had of the connectedness of everything, and that gives him a kind of tranquility, and it totally existentializes prayer.

795
01:13:13,759 --> 01:13:23,599
There isn't any person or object, but when Alyasha prays, and that's just what you'd expect, because he's gone out of the church way of thinking about it.

796
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:32,479
And it's so he doesn't pray for God's help, he does, but he helps everybody, as I wrote down.

797
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:37,519
God helps, but through Alyasha, not instead of Alyasha.

798
01:13:37,519 --> 01:13:39,280
Okay, we start to stop.
