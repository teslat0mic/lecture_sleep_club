1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
So we were looking last time in the Twilight of the Idols.

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:20,479
I'm just reviewing this just because for me, there was a piece missing which I now can just put in, and because it is one of the two places where it looks like Nietzsche and Dostoevsky are so similar.

3
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:34,240
So we were reading all this last time from Twilight about how you can't judge the value of life, that that makes no sense, that you're always in it, that you can't stand back as if you weren't in it and judge it.

4
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:45,120
And if you do, this was on 55, remember, to do that is what Nietzsche calls rebellion on 55, section 5.

5
00:00:45,120 --> 00:01:00,719
If one has grasped the blasphemous of such a rebellion against life as has in Christian morality become virtually sacrosanct, one is fortunately therewith grasped something else as well, the uselessness, illusoriness, absurdity, falsity of such a rebellion.

6
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:14,719
Well, of course, Yvonne isn't making the rebellion from the point of view of Christianity, but from a point of view of his own rational demands for justice in the face of the injustices of the world.

7
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:24,560
But rejecting life as if you had that option is, and as if that was a good thing to do if you did have that option, is what Nietzsche is calling rebellion.

8
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,800
Well, Dostoevsky has a similar notion.

9
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,079
Ivan wants to step out of life.

10
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:41,519
Remember, I told you to bring your Dostoevsky, to bring Brothers Karamatsa today, so I hope some of you have it.

11
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:48,039
On 238, I told you there was a chapter called Rebellion.

12
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:54,199
But when I tried to find where in the chapter he actually talks about rebellion, I couldn't find it.

13
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,959
And it does go by very fast, although the whole chapter is called Rebellion.

14
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:13,800
It's at the bottom of 238, where after Yvonne has said all this big talk about, in effect, for the love of humanity, he doesn't accept the world, and he's giving back the ticket.

15
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,839
That's rebellion, murmured Alyasha, looking down.

16
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,240
Rebellion, I'm sorry to hear that.

17
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:23,399
I'm sorry you call it that, said Yvonne earnestly.

18
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:26,920
One can hardly live in rebellion, and I want to live.

19
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:29,880
Then he switches to another subject.

20
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:36,839
So there's, I mean, that they should call it rebellion, which isn't an obvious thing to call it, is interesting.

21
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:46,920
That they have the same view is more interesting, that you can't stand outside of life and judge it because you are totally immersed in it.

22
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:53,000
You wouldn't be able to ever see the world from any place but involved in the world.

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,960
Now we're switching.

24
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:58,440
That was just a review of, or a bit of the end last time.

25
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:07,480
We're switching totally to the gay science and to the most important passage I presume everybody would agree in the gay science.

26
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:17,639
At least I can't imagine any candidate that comes close for having said so much in so little open space, having had so many people commenting on it.

27
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:20,599
That's on page 181.

28
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:26,360
Is there anybody who has a different edition so that I should say the numbers of these aphorisms?

29
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,959
Okay, that's number 125 on 181.

30
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:37,039
And for a while, I'm just going to read this, but every sentence is interesting and important.

31
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,440
So, the madman.

32
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,759
Have you not heard of that madman?

33
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,920
Uh-oh, I've got to turn this one out.

34
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:54,639
Have you not heard of that madman who lit a lantern in the bright morning hours, ran to the marketplace, and cried incessantly, I seek God, I seek God.

35
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:59,759
As many of those who do not believe in God were standing around then, he provoked much laughter.

36
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,199
Has he got lost, asked one.

37
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,720
Does he lose his way like a child?

38
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,360
asked another.

39
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,080
Is he hiding?

40
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:04,880
Is he afraid of us?

41
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,639
Is he going on a voyage?

42
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,599
Thus they yelled and laughed.

43
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,680
The madman jumped into their midst and pierced them with his eyes.

44
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,079
Whither is God, he cried.

45
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,319
I'll tell you, we've killed him.

46
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:20,399
You and I, all of us are the murderers.

47
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,079
How did we do this?

48
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,359
How did we drink up the sea and wipe away the horizon?

49
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,680
That's enough for a while.

50
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:37,359
So what does it mean to say that God is dead and that we have killed him?

51
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:51,040
Well, to say God is dead means that God doesn't have the importance and place in the culture that God had up to Nietzsche.

52
00:04:51,039 --> 00:05:08,240
That is, the idea that if you believed in God as the creator of the world and the source of all meaning and all intelligibility and all morality, you had sort of the common sense of the culture on your side.

53
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:18,759
But at some point, it switches over, and more and more that you have, it's the secular people who don't have to explain what they believe.

54
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:26,920
Those who still believe in God have to explain it and justify it more and more.

55
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:30,919
And the people who don't have to explain it and justify it less and less.

56
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:50,040
It just seems obvious to them that given science, given evolution, given all the things of the Big Bang and all that, it doesn't seem a plausible hypothesis anymore that there is this one supreme being that creates and explains everything.

57
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,800
So he's, so in Nietzsche talk, God is dead.

58
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:07,560
And that means you would think that the people don't believe in God because it says that those who did not believe in God were standing around and they said all these things.

59
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:21,880
But if you skip now a bit of all the list of all the bad things that are happening, I'll just, you know, we've unchanged the earth from the sun and it's plunging around and there's no longer any up and down and so forth and so forth.

60
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:28,919
And then at the end of that paragraph, do we hear nothing as yet of the noise of the gravedickers who are burying God?

61
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:32,040
Do we smell nothing yet of the divine decomposition?

62
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:34,680
God's too decompose.

63
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:38,920
God is dead, remains dead, and we've killed him.

64
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,639
And so far that's the same as I've been saying.

65
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,200
But now the next strange thing is the bottom.

66
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:47,240
Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us?

67
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,720
Must we, so no, I don't want to read that yet.

68
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,399
What am I looking for?

69
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:53,240
I don't see what I want yet.

70
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,840
Just a second.

71
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:57,320
Oh, yeah, it's the top of 182.

72
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,320
Here the madman fell silent and looked at his listeners and so forth.

73
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:04,159
Then he says, I've come too early, he said then.

74
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:05,920
My time is not yet.

75
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,519
This tremendous event is still on its way, still wandering.

76
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:12,320
It has not yet reached the ears of men.

77
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,560
Do you hear any contradiction in what I've just been reading you?

78
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,719
No, no, something more simple and sort of so obvious that you don't see it because it's right in front of you.

79
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,600
Yeah.

80
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,039
That's right.

81
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:36,159
One, that's the second thing you're saying.

82
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:42,160
The first thing is just the strange contradiction that there are always people standing around who don't believe in God.

83
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:45,600
Then it turns out that they haven't heard about what happened yet.

84
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,199
This event is too tremendous.

85
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,040
It hasn't reached the ears of men.

86
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,319
But it's the men in the marketplace who think that there's no God.

87
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,600
And in a certain way, they all seem to think that God is dead.

88
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,240
And what you said is the second point.

89
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,600
Say it again.

90
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,199
Yeah, good.

91
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:07,679
Right.

92
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:13,440
And the second point is: if they've done it, how come they don't know they did it?

93
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:23,519
And this is all very murky, but it's clear if you understand what's going on in Nietzsche's way of thinking about this.

94
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:37,279
So the interesting thing is that the unbelievers who think they don't believe in God, one, are still believers in God and have already killed God.

95
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,720
How could this be?

96
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,920
Well, I think there are two components to what it is.

97
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:48,440
One is that the people in the marketplace are, I think, scientists and people who believe in science.

98
00:08:48,439 --> 00:09:01,160
But like I said, that in our secular culture, it looks like science is explaining things and that science knows the truth, the objective truth about how the universe is.

99
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:06,360
And the people who know that are unbelievers, one might think.

100
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:17,880
But if you understand what Nietzsche means by God, it turns out that these scientists and metaphysicians who think they don't believe in God really do.

101
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:28,440
Because God, in the idea of God, is the idea that there is one objective, right story about the universe.

102
00:09:28,439 --> 00:09:34,280
That is, they believe in objective truth in science and in metaphysics.

103
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:45,560
And whenever you believe in objective truth, you believe that there's some God's eye point of view which sees the world, the universe, as it really is.

104
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,279
And of course, we can try to approximate this.

105
00:09:48,279 --> 00:10:00,120
People like Einstein thought that we, the scientists like him, had the job of trying to see the universe from God's point of view, see the whole thing.

106
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,800
And Einstein understood that he was a believer, that he believed in God.

107
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:10,040
And he was doing science to find out the structure of the universe.

108
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:16,919
And he thought God had created the universe in a way and then created the minds of human beings so that they could understand it.

109
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:23,320
So he was sure that someday he'd get it all figured, he could contribute at least to getting it figured out.

110
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:31,159
And even more recent than Einstein is Hawking, who wrote the brief history of Time.

111
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:32,959
Any of you remember that?

112
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:39,360
It sort of stands on a lot of people's coffee tables about, what, six years ago or ten years ago?

113
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,080
I don't know.

114
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,720
And not that anybody ever read it, got very far in it as far as I know.

115
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:56,000
So anyway, about the end of the book, if you get there, not that I read all the pages in between, but if you get there, he says that the job of science is to know the mind of God.

116
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:10,399
That is, if you knew all the laws of the universe and why the physical constants were the constants that they were, you'd understand sort of the ultimate, I don't know if he wants to say meaning of things, structure of things or something like that.

117
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:19,120
So people like Einstein and Penrose are still believing in God.

118
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:26,640
And even scientists who say that they're secular, don't believe in God, still believe in objective truth.

119
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:36,639
And that's enough from Nietzsche's point of view to show they haven't really stopped believing that there is some point of view from which you could get the truth about things.

120
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:38,800
This is on 283.

121
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,600
And he says, but you will have gathered what I'm driving at.

122
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:49,280
This is aphorism 344.

123
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:56,320
That is, that it is still a metaphysical faith upon which our faith in science rests.

124
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:04,079
That even we seekers after knowledge today, we godless anti-metaphysicians, see, that is, we think we're godless.

125
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,200
That is, that we are saying we don't believe in God anymore.

126
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:09,360
We don't believe in metaphysics anymore.

127
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,360
We're just solid secular believers in science.

128
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,960
We godless anti-metaphysicians still take our fire from the flame lit by a faith that is thousands of years old.

129
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:26,920
That Christian faith, which was also the faith of Plato, that God is truth, that truth is divine.

130
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:28,520
Then skipping a little.

131
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:32,759
But what if God Himself proved to be our most enduring lie?

132
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:36,759
That is, there is no objective truth.

133
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,519
What would He be if there was none?

134
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:45,880
Well, I'm going to talk more about that later, but just so you won't find it totally mysterious, all there are are interpretations, according to Nietzsche.

135
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:48,600
You've got your interpretation, I've got mine.

136
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,160
Our culture has its interpretation, Buddhist culture has its interpretation.

137
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,600
There's no right answer to which of those interpretations is the right one.

138
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,160
There's just a whole lot of perspectives.

139
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:15,480
Sometimes Nietzsche's view is called perspectivism, namely, all you've got is descriptions of yourself, your situation, the universe, the world, and those descriptions are all interpretations.

140
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:24,199
And it isn't as if there's a right answer, but you just don't know it, or that there's a better interpretation, and they get better and better until they get it right.

141
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:25,799
No, it's just interpretations.

142
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,999
That's all there is.

143
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:28,199
That's what he's saying.

144
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:31,559
And that's what it would be to really realize God.

145
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:41,239
And that's what, now you see, the people in the marketplace who think that God don't believe in God, and they haven't heard the news that God is dead.

146
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:42,600
That's the puzzle.

147
00:13:42,600 --> 00:14:07,439
Well, they think they don't believe in God, but they haven't heard the news that there's no objective point of view, no truth, that it's not enough to be anti-metaphysical and anti-theological as long as you believe that there is something with the faith of Plato, that God is true, truth, that there is truth, you're still a believer.

148
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,999
You're a believer who hasn't heard the news.

149
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:11,919
So now back to 181.

150
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,399
That answers your.

151
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,759
No, it doesn't mean it doesn't have.

152
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,360
No, it only half doesn't answer yours.

153
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,639
That's enough point one.

154
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,479
Point two is: yeah, but what does it mean to say we've killed him?

155
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:28,239
And how could we, whoever we are, we'll find out, have killed him without knowing that he's dead?

156
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:31,360
Well, that is even harder, because the one I just did was easy.

157
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:38,799
He just renamed God, and then he discovers, says that though people think they don't believe in him, they still believe in this objective truth.

158
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,519
But now it's, what's going to happen next?

159
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:51,519
Well, we're now back on 181.

160
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:56,639
We're in italics, Nietzsche's screaming at you, we have killed him.

161
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,199
And now, how can that be?

162
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:08,479
Well, I think for Nietzsche, science kills God, and more interestingly, Christianity kills God.

163
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:20,320
I'm not going to say much about sciences, because I think that's a whole big thing Nietzsche's view on science, which we don't need to understand breathless, and we don't really need to understand what's important to us about Nietzsche.

164
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:46,360
So I'll just say, sort of dogmatically: since Nietzsche thinks that there isn't any truth, and everything is interpretation, he thinks, and he thinks, that science is admirable because it's very clear-headed and sober, and has to have agreement and has to follow methods and has to get repeatable answers and so forth.

165
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,360
Science is trying to find out the truth about the universe.

166
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:52,120
And Nietzsche admires that.

167
00:15:53,080 --> 00:16:08,439
He admires it especially because he thinks that when science finally gets really good at finding out the truth about the universe, he's going to find out that it's all interpretation, that it's chaos of people, that there's no structure except what we read in.

168
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:22,520
So that science will undermine its, it won't undermine itself as science, because it can still make very important predictions and find causal laws and do nanotechnology and DNA work.

169
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,559
That's fine.

170
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:31,000
It's just that science can't claim, once it sees what the universe is really like, that there's any one right answer.

171
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:40,279
There's always whatever science discovered is relative to our interests, our capacities to perceive, and our kind of mind.

172
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:46,039
And there's no reason to think that God has made the universe to conform to our way of thinking.

173
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,199
And so we're just putting our way of thinking as a kind of projection on it.

174
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,199
And that's fine.

175
00:16:52,199 --> 00:17:05,559
And what interests me is, I would have thought that scientists, at least, wouldn't like this view that science is a social construction, which is very popular in English departments, conflict departments, and rhetoric departments.

176
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,520
Philosophy departments are more resistant to it, I think.

177
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:15,399
But there are plenty of smart philosophers who think it too, that there isn't any right answer in science.

178
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:19,560
It's a kind of power game and a respect worth something or other.

179
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:28,280
Well, I would have thought, and certain philosophers have said, scientists have to believe at least that they're getting the real truth about the world.

180
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,800
Otherwise, why would they work and sacrifice their leisure and struggle on?

181
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:40,719
Why would there be Nobel Prizes if the Nobel Prize was just a prize for somebody's interpretation, triumphing over somebody else's interpretation?

182
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:49,999
Well, when I talk to younger scientists, my daughter among them, Humans, but also, I mean, people who are not influenced.

183
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:52,319
I'm still the old school.

184
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,320
I really like to believe that science is going to be getting it righter and writer about the universe.

185
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,600
But I do see that Nietzsche's winning out.

186
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:06,319
That he would be pleased to say, he did say that people wouldn't really accept his views and understand him for 300 years.

187
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:09,360
Turns out it's happening a lot faster than he realized.

188
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:21,200
The people I talk to in physics and so forth don't anymore claim that there is some one right answer of the structure of the universe that they're getting.

189
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:30,000
They're making some interesting construction that they will try to convince everybody of, which will correspond to some observation, so forth.

190
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:32,959
Now, that I said isn't very interesting to what we're talking about.

191
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:47,360
What we're talking about, because this course is all tied in with the Judeo-Christian tradition, not with the fate of theory, is whether the Christians themselves kill God.

192
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,959
Nietzsche thinks that.

193
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:52,639
And that's a lot more interesting and ingenious.

194
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:58,319
How could it be that Christianity, in Nietzsche language, overcame itself?

195
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,159
What would it be for Christianity to overcome itself?

196
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:09,519
Well, it's a funny variation on what I just said, because what I just said was: science is dedicated to truth.

197
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:13,360
The truth about the universe is that there isn't any truth about the universe.

198
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,120
It's all just chaos.

199
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:25,719
So science, in its serious devotion to the truth, will come to the conclusion that there isn't any truth of the sort that, say, Einstein and Newton believed in.

200
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:30,199
Well, Christianity is also devoted to the truth, a different truth.

201
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:33,799
Getting people to be honest about their desires.

202
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:41,719
Remember from the very Sermon on the Mount on, Christianity takes people's desires very seriously.

203
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:44,279
And you are what you desire.

204
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:50,679
You better purify your desires and face your evil desires and so forth.

205
00:19:50,679 --> 00:20:07,479
So Christianity develops a whole technology for analyzing people's desires in confession, helping them realize that a lot of what they think they desire is really they're fooling themselves.

206
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:10,360
They're covering up their dark desires.

207
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,600
And like Yvonne is, I mean, he desires to torture people.

208
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:23,560
It's nice that Elisa slammed the door on her finger, thumb, or whatever, and while sitting there bleeding and so forth.

209
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,519
But Yvonne would be the last to admit it.

210
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:31,639
So people have a lot of dark desires that they don't admit.

211
00:20:31,639 --> 00:20:49,239
But Christianity, trying to get the truth about them and get them to confess and get them to face their dark desires in order to finally get them purified and so forth, has become very good at finding out whether people are fooling themselves about their desires or not.

212
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:59,639
And now the picture Nietzsche has is, well, and we'll hear more about this in a minute, they, well, I think we should better hear it now.

213
00:20:59,639 --> 00:21:01,880
But Christian, well, I'll read this first and then I'll tell you more.

214
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:16,159
I mean, what people desire, I'll just say it, is that the universe has meaning and a place in it, and that morality makes sense, and that God isn't dead, so all things aren't lawful.

215
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:19,199
That's what they would like.

216
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,519
But is that a cover-up of what is really the case?

217
00:21:24,639 --> 00:21:31,199
They've got to not fool themselves by thinking that just because they would like it, that's the way it is.

218
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:39,999
So now comes Christianity around to analyze people's desires and beliefs and see whether they really are justified.

219
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:47,919
And in this, and so here you hear them on the middle of 307, you're going to hear how Christianity did in Christianity.

220
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:53,279
It's 357, aphorism 357, page 307.

221
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,719
You see what really triumphed over the Christian God?

222
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:59,120
Christian morality itself.

223
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,439
The concept of truthfulness that was understood ever more rigorously.

224
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:05,280
That's how it worked in science too.

225
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:10,159
If you're dedicated to the truth and there isn't any truth, then someday you're going to undermine yourself.

226
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:21,759
The Father Confessor's refinement of the Christian conscience translated and sublimated into a scientific conscience, into intellectual cleanliness at any price.

227
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:38,760
Interpreting, I'm going to skip a bit, interpreting one's experiences as pious people have long enough interpreted theirs as if everything were providential, a hint designed and ordained for the sake of the salvation of the soul.

228
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,639
It is all over now.

229
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:42,959
Nietzsche's always sort of screaming about this.

230
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:55,559
That has man's conscience against it, and then, skipping down a bit, in this severity, if anywhere, we're good Europeans and heirs to Europe's longest, most courageous self-overcoming.

231
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:03,880
So, science self-overcomes by discovering that all you've got is interpretations, instructions.

232
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:20,279
And Christianity overcomes by discovering that, and now we've got to go into more detail, that something that people always wanted, but which isn't there, is something that they've been fooling themselves into believing is there.

233
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,959
And of course, that's God.

234
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:25,559
But now let's look at it more carefully.

235
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:36,360
Nietzsche has this idea that what human beings want more than anything else is meaning in their lives.

236
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:50,279
And we are, in our culture, especially good at convincing ourselves that it all makes sense and that there's some reason why the world is the way it is and we're in it.

237
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,120
So, this is on 75.

238
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:57,159
It's aphorism one of book one, page seventy-five.

239
00:23:59,399 --> 00:24:13,319
And what happens is people get more and more interested in finding meaning in the world and fool themselves more and more in thinking that there is some kind of meaning in the world.

240
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:24,279
So, in the middle of the paragraph below the middle of the page, he says: human nature has been changed by the ever-new appearance of teachers of the purpose of existence.

241
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:31,679
It now has one additional need, that is, between the kind of need that animals have, that normal people have.

242
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:38,239
It has one additional need, the need for the ever-new appearance of such teachers and teachings of a purpose.

243
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,639
Well, that's only part of the story.

244
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,279
The story is, we'll read more.

245
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:50,399
Gradually, man has become a fantastic animal that has to fulfill one more condition of existence than any other animal.

246
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:55,679
Man has to believe, to know from time to time, why he exists.

247
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:01,840
His race cannot flourish without a periodical trust in life, without a faith and reason in life.

248
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:10,559
And again and again, the human race will decree from time to time there is something at which it is absolutely forbidden henceforth to laugh.

249
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,959
Well, lots of things are happening there.

250
00:25:12,959 --> 00:25:18,399
But basically, the idea is, I think, it's sort of in two parts, I think.

251
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:20,799
I don't know how much Nietzsche has worked this out.

252
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,639
Not any place I've seen it, but it seems like it's something he needs to believe.

253
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:35,920
When he says, sort of, all human beings and all animals know why they exist, I think he means that's true, the Native Americans and the Bali people and the Japanese.

254
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:45,360
Every culture has some myths and some ritual that tell it sort of what's going on in the universe and its place in it.

255
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:54,719
But Nietzsche also thinks that no culture has ever gotten so addicted to so much meaning as this culture.

256
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,519
Because when you think of it, it's pretty amazing.

257
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:08,559
We're the only culture that has the kind of monotheism, which has this notion that there is one creator, God, who is the source of everything.

258
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:15,600
Remember, all meaning, all intelligibility, all moral laws, and actually created the universe itself.

259
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:43,399
I don't think there's any other religion that the Judeo-Christian, and I suppose the Muslims too, which is part of that same Western kind of religion, this particular Western culture, with its particular God, has pushed this meaning of why we exist to the absolute limit, and we become completely meaning addicts.

260
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:54,439
That is, we have a super monotheistic understanding, partly because of the way these two cultures came together.

261
00:26:54,439 --> 00:27:00,760
On the Hebrew side, there was this creator God, who seemed to be the source of everything.

262
00:27:01,639 --> 00:27:15,159
And then on the Greek side, there was the Plato good, the good, which was some sort of super being that was the source of morality and intelligibility of everything.

263
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:16,600
And then they got put together.

264
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:22,120
That's the story I told you in the first lecture by Augustine and the church fathers and then St.

265
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,840
Thomas.

266
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:39,480
They kept trying, because they looked so similar, because they were these two very, very meaning-oriented, supreme being-oriented cultures, they just merged to a super or supreme being-oriented culture.

267
00:27:39,479 --> 00:27:44,120
What Nietzsche calls monotonotheism, because he doesn't like it.

268
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:50,439
And he wants to say, everything gets explained finally in terms of this Supreme Being.

269
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:53,000
For Nietzsche, that's monotonous theism.

270
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:55,240
Now, I wrote here, but I don't remember why.

271
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:58,199
You should look at 725 in the Brothers Karamatsu.

272
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,880
It seems strange to me.

273
00:28:00,439 --> 00:28:03,199
I'll go there and I'll tell you what happened.

274
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,600
725.

275
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,039
Here it is, my boy.

276
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,279
What is that?

277
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,479
Suppose we look at 725 in here, but I don't know what happened.

278
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:22,880
Something in the computer is crazy.

279
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,519
I don't know.

280
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,320
So I'll have to come back and tell you if there is any interesting point behind that.

281
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,239
Let me just mark it.

282
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,159
I can't think of anything about why the Brothers K would be relevant.

283
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,239
Okay, so the important thing is Nietzsche's views.

284
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:44,799
And now let's go to 343.

285
00:28:48,320 --> 00:29:09,120
It's only when you sort of build up what God means, not only that it's the truth of science, but that all meaning comes from God, that you see how what a terrible thing it would be if we, how much we need God, how much we're ready to fool ourselves into thinking that there's a God, and so forth.

286
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:15,039
This is on number, this is number 343, page 279.

287
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,199
I'm going to start reading about 10 lines down.

288
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:27,600
This follows on the death of God story.

289
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:40,799
The event itself, that's the death of God, itself is far too great, too distant, too remote from the multitude's capacity for comprehension, even for the tidings of it to be thought of as having arrived yet.

290
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:46,639
Much less may one suppose that many people know as yet what this event really means.

291
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,479
Now, now remember, that's the people in the marketplace.

292
00:29:49,479 --> 00:30:18,279
So they don't really understand that science has undermined belief in God as the truth, and that Christianity has undermined our desire to believe that there's some cause, there's some meaning in existence, because they, I didn't know if I made it clear enough, they're very good at seeing the way people fool themselves into believing what is not, because they want to believe it, what isn't so.

293
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:25,480
And what they fool themselves into believing is that there's this unified meaning behind existence.

294
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:32,360
And the techniques of determining how people fool themselves undermine that belief.

295
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,639
I'm just going back over that.

296
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,479
But now, what does it mean?

297
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:37,240
The death of God.

298
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,079
They don't know what it means.

299
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:43,640
But now, how much must collapse now that this faith has been undermined?

300
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:48,040
Because it was built upon this faith, propped up by it, grown into it.

301
00:30:48,039 --> 00:31:14,520
For example, the whole of our European morality, this long plentitude and sequence of breakdown, destruction, ruin, and cataclysm that is now impending, who could guess today, enough of it today, to be compelled to play the teacher and advanced proclaimer of this monstrous logic of terror, the prospect of a gloom and an eclipse of the sun whose light has never yet occurred on earth.

302
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:15,079
That's it.

303
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:27,640
You see why he can be confident that nothing like this has ever occurred on earth before, or in the galaxy for that matter, or in the universe for that matter, as far as he can tell.

304
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:32,640
Why is this so special, this breakdown?

305
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:42,639
Well, it's just the other side of what's special about the monotheistic Western super monotheism.

306
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:57,760
I mean, it's only a culture who thinks that there is one God that explains everything that will have this total collapse of its morality and its intelligibility if that God becomes unbelievable.

307
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:04,640
If you're a polytheist, you've got thousands of gods like in Japan, one more or less doesn't make much difference.

308
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:12,560
But if you say everything is coming from this one, and then the collapse of that is absolutely unique.

309
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:18,800
But and yet, these people haven't admitted it yet.

310
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:35,280
That's because they have become so addicted to meaning and this God that gives the universe meaning that they don't want to acknowledge that there never was anything.

311
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,880
There never was anything.

312
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,800
God is dead, of course, doesn't mean there was once a God that was alive.

313
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:46,560
There was a God once that was important in the Middle Ages and so forth.

314
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:52,719
But now, in retrospect, it turns out it was all a self-deception.

315
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,880
That's what Nietzsche thinks.

316
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,800
So, and that people will do anything to believe in that kind of God.

317
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:09,280
So, in 33, for instance, he's got just one interesting sentence in the maxims of Twilight of the Idols, page 33.

318
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:14,720
If we possess our why of life, we can put up with almost any how.

319
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:31,079
Now, that means to say, if we can get this explanation of why we're here and what we're supposed to do, we'll suffer, we'll be willing to suffer, we'll be willing to fight religious wars, we'll be willing to do all sorts of things.

320
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:38,360
If only we can believe that there's an answer to why we're here and what we're supposed to do.

321
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:51,320
But when religion gets good at finding out the truth, then it finds out that this craving for meaning and order has been souped up to this kind of addiction to meaning and order.

322
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:56,040
I mean, every, remember, I think all animals, all human animals, have a craving for meaning and order.

323
00:33:56,039 --> 00:34:03,800
But none of them got into such a delusion of having totally satisfied it as we did.

324
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:14,360
And then when the craving for meaning and order doesn't have any evidence to support it, then Christianity undermines itself.

325
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,679
That's the sense in which God is dead.

326
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,280
We've killed him.

327
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:37,399
Christianity undermines any reason for believing in God by examining the motives for believing in God and finding out that those motives are all what people would like, but they aren't based on anything that people can, that you can believe or trust.

328
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:42,760
I'm looking for something to see if I've already said certain things.

329
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:44,599
But let's go look.

330
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,240
Have I already talked about page 307?

331
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,000
It seems to me I have.

332
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:53,320
It's right to see it again.

333
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,599
But yeah, that's the, I was just coming back.

334
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:07,040
That's just to say we've gone through the longest and most total collapse that any culture could go through.

335
00:35:07,919 --> 00:35:10,159
Anyone want to say anything about any of this so far?

336
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,439
Yeah, go ahead.

337
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:22,079
Nietzsche would like that.

338
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,199
Now, where's Fuhrerbach?

339
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,880
He's after Nietzsche, presumably.

340
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,719
I'm not chronology isn't any good.

341
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,439
Anyone know?

342
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:28,399
When is Fuhrerbach?

343
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,000
You brought him up.

344
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,320
I think he's before Nietzsche.

345
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,239
Okay, well, Nietzsche would like that if he knew Feuerbach.

346
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:36,880
Yeah.

347
00:35:51,999 --> 00:35:54,240
Ah, that's a terrific question.

348
00:35:54,399 --> 00:35:55,840
We have to put that off.

349
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,519
Let me think when we're going to get to it.

350
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:01,679
I think not next time even, because it doesn't matter for breathless.

351
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:07,679
But in the end, that's the confrontation find between Kierkegaard and Nietzsche.

352
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,880
I mean, because Kierkegaard says that Christianity has no objective validity.

353
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,599
He says it.

354
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,880
I mean, because it gets all of its validity from the commitments of the people in it.

355
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:31,919
But if you are committed to it, then you get eternity and time and all that, even though it hasn't got the kind of meaning grounded in a supreme being that Christianity thought it had.

356
00:36:31,919 --> 00:36:41,840
Instead of thinking, well, that must be the end and the disaster, Kierkegaard says, no, that just shows what a strenuous and interesting and exciting thing it is to be a Christian.

357
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:46,200
Yeah, that's exactly the right question, but I'm not going to talk about it yet.

358
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,600
Anybody else?

359
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:51,720
Okay, then let's go back to this again.

360
00:36:52,599 --> 00:37:03,480
So now comes the fun part that when Nietzsche gets into describing the disaster that's going to follow, we read some of that already, but that's only part of it.

361
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:07,480
Let's see now.

362
00:37:07,479 --> 00:37:11,080
So it's going to be a kind of reign of terror.

363
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:16,280
We just read that on 343.

364
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:38,760
I want to come back to it now because this is the result when finally science and Christianity both become suspicious of this belief in God as founded only in this strong desire to have meaning without any evidence for it, then everything falls apart.

365
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:49,799
And Nietzsche calls this collapse a cataclysm, which is a nice thing to call it because what is a cataclysm?

366
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:57,480
I gather that a cataclysm is a kind of breakdown of the foundation.

367
00:37:57,479 --> 00:38:04,120
It's a kind of huge earthquake in which everything collapses.

368
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:11,399
And it's a neat name for this because God has been the foundation, the ground, the support of everything.

369
00:38:11,399 --> 00:38:24,760
And when God gets undermined, even though the people who do the undermining don't realize they've done it, as they begin to realize they've done it, then it begins to be a complete breakdown of everything.

370
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:29,960
And when they finally realize it, it will be the total breakdown of everything.

371
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:39,360
And that's the cataclysm he's talking about: this long plenitude and sequence of breakdown, destruction, ruin, and cataclysm that's now impending.

372
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,079
Who could guess?

373
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:41,840
Stop with that.

374
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:53,280
Now, this is interesting in itself, but it's particularly interesting if you're asking yourself, could Nietzsche, does it look like Nietzsche read The Brothers?

375
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,719
Do you recognize that?

376
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,679
Probably not.

377
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:01,599
But does that strike you as familiar, this talk about the cataclysm?

378
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,840
Yeah.

379
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,360
That's right.

380
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,559
It's one of Yvonne's papers or whatever they were.

381
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,439
And who tells him about it?

382
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:14,959
The devil.

383
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:20,079
The devil comes and talks to Yvonne when the devil is there talking to Yvonne.

384
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,480
Yvonne is hallucinating the devil.

385
00:39:22,479 --> 00:39:25,280
And you have to read this to see.

386
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,240
Now, I haven't told you the whole Nietzsche story yet, but just enough to get to the word cataclysm.

387
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,720
So now we're going to see the Dostoevsky story.

388
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:38,880
And then we'll go back and see how much Nietzsche could have gotten from this Dostoevsky story.

389
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,840
It's really absolutely wonderful and amazing.

390
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:46,160
And so we start on 6:13 of the brothers.

391
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:59,119
This is called, this paper, The Geological Cataclysm.

392
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,439
See that about 12 lines down?

393
00:40:01,439 --> 00:40:03,840
The devil says, and the geological cataclysm.

394
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,559
Do you remember?

395
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:06,160
That was a poem.

396
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,959
And Yvonne says, keep quiet or I'll kill you.

397
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,399
And then they go around saying funny things to each other for a while until about the very middle of the page.

398
00:40:14,399 --> 00:40:18,600
I'm going to read the whole thing because it's just so similar.

399
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:30,280
As soon as men have all denied God, and I believe that now the devil is quoting Yvonne, and I believe that period corresponding with geological periods will come to pass.

400
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:38,280
The old conception of the universe will fall of itself without cannibalism, and once more the old morality and everything will begin anew.

401
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:44,919
Men will unite to take from life all that it can give, but only for joy and happiness in the present world.

402
00:40:44,919 --> 00:40:50,919
Man will be lifted up with a spirit of divine titanic pride, and the man God will appear.

403
00:40:50,919 --> 00:41:00,520
Extending his conquest of nature by his will and his science, man will feel such lofty joy from hour to hour that it will make up for all his old dreams and the joys of heaven.

404
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:02,600
Everyone will know that he is mortal.

405
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:07,160
Everyone will know that he is mortal and will accept death proudly and serenely like a God.

406
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:16,999
His pride will teach him that it's useless for him to grieve at life's being a moment, and he will love his brother without need of reward and love the fact that life is a moment.

407
00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:19,160
You will see more about that later.

408
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:34,519
Love will be sufficiently only for a moment of life, that this very consciousness will intensify its fire, which now is dissipated in dreams of eternal love beyond the grave, and so on and so on, in the same style.

409
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:35,880
Charming.

410
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:49,720
And I better read you a little more at the bottom of the page, because it's all so relevant.

411
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,919
Four lines from the bottom.

412
00:41:50,919 --> 00:41:55,560
That since owing to man's stupidity, this cannot come about for at least a thousand years.

413
00:41:55,559 --> 00:42:01,880
Everyone who recognizes the truth now may legitimately order his life as he pleases on the new principle.

414
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:05,040
In that sense, all things are lawful for him.

415
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:16,720
What's more, even if this period never comes, since there is anyway no God and no immortality, the new man may well become the man-God, even if he is the only one in the whole world promoted to this new position.

416
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:22,560
He may lightheartedly overstep all the barriers of the old morality, the old slave man, if necessary.

417
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:28,160
There's no law or God where God stands, and so forth.

418
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,840
Okay, now that's Dostoevsky.

419
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,840
Now look at Nietzsche.

420
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,720
We'll see what he thinks.

421
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:57,759
This is, remember, this is Yvonne's version of what will happen when there is this cataclysm and God is dead, and everybody recognizes that God is dead, and the whole world collapses into this terribly dark situation.

422
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:05,840
I just want to read more in 181 of the darkness before I get to the, on 180, on 125, page 181.

423
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,799
Remember?

424
00:43:10,959 --> 00:43:12,239
No, I think that's enough.

425
00:43:12,479 --> 00:43:15,919
I'm going to go on with Nietzsche's response.

426
00:43:15,919 --> 00:43:26,800
So notice now, yeah, I think I should just go directly to page stand 279 where we were.

427
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:33,919
So we've just read about the sequence of breakdown, destruction, cataclysm, and so forth.

428
00:43:33,919 --> 00:43:47,240
Who could guess enough to be compelled to play the teacher and the France proclaimer of this monstrous logic of terror, the prophet of a gloom and an eclipse of the sun whose light has probably never yet occurred on earth?

429
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,639
Why?

430
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,439
We thought, because it's everything at last.

431
00:43:50,439 --> 00:43:55,560
Now, what's peculiar about that particular aphorism on page 270?

432
00:43:55,559 --> 00:44:00,439
I just read you about the most dark and gloomy and horrible prediction you could imagine.

433
00:44:00,439 --> 00:44:06,840
Everything just goes completely to hell, and there's nothing left but darkness and disaster.

434
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:11,240
Well, that's called the meaning of our cheerfulness, if you look back up at the top.

435
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,880
Now, that needs some explaining.

436
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,559
Somebody thinks it's funny.

437
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:16,680
I think it's funny.

438
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,600
And so, why is it the meaning of our cheerfulness?

439
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:23,320
Well, it isn't as if we're going to get the meaning back.

440
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,599
That would be the first thing.

441
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:30,439
Maybe there'll become a new God, maybe a better God, something, we'll all believe in something else that's meaningful.

442
00:44:30,439 --> 00:44:32,199
Now, that's not how it's going to be.

443
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:37,720
Look at 124, right, before the madman, back on page 180.

444
00:44:38,999 --> 00:44:41,159
We have left the land and have embarked.

445
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,320
We burned our bridges behind us.

446
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,600
Indeed, we've gone further and destroyed the land behind us.

447
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:47,880
Now, little ship, look out.

448
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,760
Beside you is the ocean, and so forth and so forth.

449
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:56,680
Hours will come and you realize that it's infinite and nothing more awesome than infinity.

450
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:04,280
And then what will skip, woe when you feel homesick for the land as if it offered you more freedom and there's no longer any land.

451
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,439
Well, that's pretty metaphorical.

452
00:45:06,439 --> 00:45:17,240
But that says something like: you can't go back to the solid foundation on the earth, on the ground, on the basis of which you can make sense of things.

453
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,600
It's gone.

454
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:21,480
And you burned the bridges behind you.

455
00:45:21,479 --> 00:45:23,320
You've destroyed the land behind.

456
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:34,320
Now, it's interesting to try to figure out why it's destroyed and why there is no more land once this all collapses.

457
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:41,439
Well, the answer is, of course, that it's because everything has been built into it.

458
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:44,160
That's back on page wherever.

459
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,039
Let's see now.

460
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:48,800
Yeah, on the middle of 279.

461
00:45:50,160 --> 00:46:03,919
Much less may one suppose that many people know as yet what this event really means, how much must collapse now that the faith has been undermined, because it was built upon this faith, propped up by it, grown into it, the whole of European morality, for example.

462
00:46:03,919 --> 00:46:33,120
Okay, so if everything we understand in our morality, in our understanding of the universe, in how we make sense of things, if it's all built into this supreme being, this monotheistic account, and we stop believing in the supreme being by undermining it through our suspicious kind of belief about our own, getting the truth about our own desires, and our finding out about the universe is just chaos.

463
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:40,640
If we undermine this, then we undermine everything, because it's all built into this.

464
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,800
And if we undermine everything, then you can't go back.

465
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,320
You burned your bridges behind you.

466
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,759
There's no land behind you.

467
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,480
We've destroyed the land behind us.

468
00:46:50,479 --> 00:47:02,960
Because once, I mean, you don't, the cultures, my Bali or Japanese are my favorite examples and so forth, cultures who never had one God, don't have this problem.

469
00:47:03,439 --> 00:47:08,880
Their values aren't all built on some one thing, so that if that collapsed, everything would collapse.

470
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,159
They still got the ground.

471
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:15,280
They've got their local traditional ritual mythical ground to stand on.

472
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:34,520
But if you, if this is the penalty, so to speak, Nietzsche would say, for having built this beautiful edifice of meaning in order to satisfy more and more our desire for meaning and produce the most meaningful culture ever, the cost of it is it's a lie.

473
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:42,200
And when the lie comes out, the more you build it all into this, the more it all collapses.

474
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,360
You can't get it back.

475
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,439
There's no way to get the people.

476
00:47:47,399 --> 00:47:50,680
So now, and what is Nietzsche's response to that?

477
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:56,119
Well, that's, it would begin to sound familiar.

478
00:47:56,119 --> 00:47:59,800
So let's start the bottom paragraph on 181.

479
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:03,320
How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers?

480
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:09,800
What was holiest and mightiest of all, that the world has yet known as bled to death under our knives?

481
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,760
Who will wipe the blood from us, and so forth and so forth?

482
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,880
Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us?

483
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:20,120
Must we not ourselves become gods simply to be worthy of it?

484
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:21,560
Sound familiar?

485
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:23,159
Like what he might have been reading?

486
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:27,320
I mean, Dostoevsky says we should become gods ourselves.

487
00:48:27,959 --> 00:48:32,360
And then Yvonne's got this whole picture.

488
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:35,959
Let's go back to 739.

489
00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:44,599
It's spread around in Dostoevsky, I think.

490
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:48,760
I mean, I haven't ever looked it all up, but oh, what's happening here?

491
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,679
Seven.

492
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,999
I'm wrong about seven thirteen.

493
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:55,080
Six thirteen in Dostoevsky and the brothers.

494
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:56,800
More of Yvonne.

495
00:48:59,999 --> 00:49:01,599
Okay, the God-man will appear.

496
00:48:56,519 --> 00:49:02,559
Well, I read that already.

497
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:05,360
Okay, let's see if that's what we want.

498
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:06,399
Yeah, the God-man will appear.

499
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,080
And now there and how will people feel about this?

500
00:49:12,399 --> 00:49:15,120
Well, they'll be very happy.

501
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,840
They'll be joyful, Yvonne says.

502
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:28,399
And everyone will know that they're God and be proud and serene and loving and so forth.

503
00:49:28,399 --> 00:49:32,239
And they will order their lives on this new principle.

504
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,280
They'll be as happy as if they were in heaven, he says.

505
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,720
And the new man becomes the man-god and so forth.

506
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:45,360
Well, Nietzsche has the same view.

507
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,439
It's going to be terrific.

508
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,680
That's why he's cheerful.

509
00:49:50,399 --> 00:50:06,000
Once you get over this cataclysm, you will wake up as if from a long sickness, and you will be all the healthier and happier for having overcome the sickness.

510
00:50:05,999 --> 00:50:15,439
That is, you will have what Nietzsche would call the greatest overcoming that any culture ever had.

511
00:50:15,439 --> 00:50:18,160
I mean, that's the other side of the greatest collapse.

512
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:31,919
No other culture had the opportunity to have, so to speak, the open sea before us and be able to start from scratch to build our own world as this culture does.

513
00:50:31,919 --> 00:50:36,640
Because it's not bound by tradition and ritual and myths.

514
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,000
They're all gone.

515
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:44,000
They all got swallowed up by Christianity and then they collapsed.

516
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:52,760
And now you have this wonderful feeling of having sort of waked up from a bad dream and full of health and vigor.

517
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:57,000
And that's sort of behind the gay science.

518
00:50:56,999 --> 00:51:00,360
He's built it into the gay science from the very start.

519
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:09,800
The gay science is about recovering from a sickness and what a positive thing that is and how new and joyful you feel.

520
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,320
That's the gay science.

521
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,880
It's sometimes translated the joyful wisdom.

522
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,960
It could be either way in German.

523
00:51:15,959 --> 00:51:27,080
But he starts right out in the preface to the second edition on page 32 to do this, to say that this book is about an experience.

524
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:33,800
And it's about an experience of, at the end of the first paragraph, the proximity of winter and the triumph over winter.

525
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:41,160
Or to put in the middle of the next of that page, it's about the hope of health and the intoxication of convalescence.

526
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,040
That's the state the culture is in.

527
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:47,720
Once there, I mean, he thinks probably it's not there yet, except for him.

528
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:57,800
And he remembers it might take, sometimes he says 300 years, sometimes he says 1,000 before people will be able to recognize that there isn't any God and accept it.

529
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:04,999
And they have to go through all this disaster of everybody killing everybody and this clear failure of all morality.

530
00:52:04,999 --> 00:52:08,840
And so everybody's thinking that God is dead, all things are possible.

531
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:13,800
But when they finally get over all that, then they are in good shape.

532
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:18,200
And he talks about that in about 15 lines from the bottom of 32.

533
00:52:18,519 --> 00:52:36,880
He talks about the rejoicing of strength, that is, the returning of a reawakened faith in a mot tomorrow and a day after tomorrow, a sense of anticipation, impending adventures of seas that are open again, we recognize the infinite open sea because they got rid of the land, of goals that are permitted again.

534
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:46,159
Or at the bottom of 33, in some it is their deprivations that philosophize.

535
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,800
That's what's wrong with philosophers like Yvonne.

536
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:54,320
In others, that there are others who can philosophize out of richness and strength.

537
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,360
That's Nietzsche.

538
00:52:55,360 --> 00:53:03,279
The former need their philosophy, whether it be as a proper sedative, a medicine, redemption, elevation, or self-alienation.

539
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,919
But the latter, it's a beautiful luxury.

540
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:14,320
So that's not so important as the claim that all of this is going to be like recovering from a sickness.

541
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:24,480
And that means that it's the most, it's a very healthy thing.

542
00:53:24,479 --> 00:53:41,199
In fact, it's the healthiest thing you can do is to constantly outgrow and overcome whatever it is that's holding you back, drawing you down, like a sickness.

543
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:52,639
So we have to read more about that, what he calls the great health, which is 382 in aphorisms, 346 in our pages.

544
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:03,199
So now he's talking about, and let's give them a name.

545
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,240
He's talking about what he calls the free spirits.

546
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:15,200
Those are the people who are happy and cheerful and feel grateful about this collapse.

547
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:25,720
They even feel grateful that there was this thickness so that it could collapse, because it made them stronger to have gone through it and then recovered from it.

548
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:36,360
So here he's talking about this great health at the bottom of 346 in the last paragraph, page 346.

549
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:49,240
And now, after we've long been on our way in this manner, we aggregate, argonauts of the ideal, with more daring perhaps than is prudent, and have suffered shipwreck and damage often enough.

550
00:54:49,479 --> 00:54:56,840
We are to repeat, healthier than ones likes to permit us, dangerously healthy, ever again healthy.

551
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:02,360
It will seem to us as if, as a reward, we now confronted an as yet undiscovered country.

552
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:10,040
Now, last time it was the open sea, whose boundaries nobody has surveyed yet, something beyond all the lands and nooks of the ideal so far.

553
00:55:10,039 --> 00:55:20,360
A world so overrich in what is beautiful, strange, questionable, terrible, and divine that our curiosity as well as our craving to possess it got beside itself.

554
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,880
Alas, now nothing will say to us anymore.

555
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:32,600
Well, that's nice and interesting, and that's the part of this experience of the great health.

556
00:55:33,399 --> 00:55:40,280
But what's interesting on that list, and I'll come back and talk to more about this after.

557
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:45,480
Well, to mention it now, it's got to have some relevance.

558
00:55:45,479 --> 00:55:48,439
That do you notice what is not on that list?

559
00:55:48,439 --> 00:55:50,760
It's very hard to notice what's not there.

560
00:55:50,760 --> 00:56:01,480
That there's something, he says how beautiful, strange, questionable, terrible, divine the world will look to these new healthy people who survived the collapse.

561
00:56:01,479 --> 00:56:03,760
Well, it won't look meaningful.

562
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,240
That's what's not on the list.

563
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:19,360
How intelligible, how understandable, how, what was the phrase on 33 that in the maxims that people had to have or die, that's not on the list.

564
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,880
The why of life.

565
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,959
Well, yeah, it's not going to give you a meaning.

566
00:56:22,959 --> 00:56:24,239
It's not going to give you a why.

567
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,840
It's going to give you a whole lot of other things.

568
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,480
Beautiful, strange, questionable, terrible.

569
00:56:28,479 --> 00:56:31,280
And he's going to redefine the divine.

570
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:40,160
The divine in this sickness that the culture went through for 2,000 years was the why, was the meaning.

571
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,560
Now the divine is all this other stuff.

572
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:51,919
If you need one word for it, I think Nietzsche's got the notion that instead of the world of meaning, it's a kind of wonder world.

573
00:56:52,240 --> 00:57:01,680
Everything is wonderful and strange and surprising and all these things, beautiful, questionable, terrible.

574
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,519
That's all wonder talk, as opposed to meaning talk.

575
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:08,079
He's inventing this whole thing, he needs to.

576
00:57:08,399 --> 00:57:19,840
If he's going to tell us what it's going to be like for these happy people after the world has collapsed and there's no meaning left, he's not going to be telling you, or it'd be very boring.

577
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,520
There would be a new meaning now.

578
00:57:21,519 --> 00:57:27,439
Science will tell us, psychoanalysis will tell us, whatever, DNA will tell us.

579
00:57:27,439 --> 00:57:31,359
I mean, he's not going to find some new answer to why.

580
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:45,520
He's going to say, well, it's just wonderful to be on this open sea with no boundaries, no landmarks, no rules, inventing, constantly reinventing ourselves, reinventing the world.

581
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:49,720
And you'll see when you're reading, having new suns, for instance, we've let the old sun go.

582
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:54,199
He said it's disconnected because it was part of the divine picture.

583
00:57:54,519 --> 00:57:56,919
But we'll invent new sons.

584
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,919
And that's the idea.

585
00:58:00,919 --> 00:58:03,239
And it goes on on 347.

586
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,519
So let's read more of it.

587
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,600
First, I want to see where I am.

588
00:58:15,079 --> 00:58:16,759
Yeah, let's read it.

589
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,360
Another, a second paragraph.

590
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,120
I'm going to read all of that too.

591
00:58:22,119 --> 00:58:25,479
Another ideal, because this is related to the movie.

592
00:58:25,479 --> 00:58:34,520
Another ideal runs ahead of us, a strange, tempting, dangerous ideal that which we should not wish to persuade anybody because we do not readily concede the right to it to anybody.

593
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:45,800
An ideal of a spirit who plays naively, that is, not deliberately, but from overflowing power and abundance, with all that was hitherto called holy, good, untouchable, divine.

594
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,919
For whom?

595
00:58:50,439 --> 00:58:53,160
For whom, where were we?

596
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:56,840
I've lost it.

597
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:10,360
Oh, yeah, for whom those supreme things that the people naturally accept as their value standards signify danger, decay, debasement, or at least recreation, blindness, and temporary self-oblivion.

598
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:35,360
Now, this is the good thing: the ideal of a human, superhuman well-being and benevolence that will often appear inhuman, for example, when it confronts all earthly seriousness, so far all solemnity in gesture, word, tone, eye, morality, and tasks and tasks, all these, so far as if it were their most incarnate and involuntary parody.

599
00:59:35,999 --> 00:59:41,120
In spite of all this, or perhaps with it, let's stop with that.

600
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:49,200
So that's, again, one way to put this, remember, is that the old sacred was something at which you couldn't laugh.

601
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,640
And remember, he said that, I read that earlier today.

602
00:59:52,640 --> 01:00:00,880
And remember in the brothers, Alyasha tells the boys that there's something at which they cannot laugh.

603
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:08,639
That's what now, even everything, even the sacred, is up to make jokes about.

604
01:00:08,959 --> 01:00:11,519
There's nothing at which one cannot laugh.

605
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:13,439
That's what Nietzsche wants to say.

606
01:00:13,919 --> 01:00:19,359
It was kind of a cowardice to take something and say that you can't.

607
01:00:19,999 --> 01:00:25,760
In the brothers, it's a little below the middle of 728.

608
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:38,399
Together at this stone, the cruelest and most mocking of us, if we do become so, will not dare to laugh inwardly at having been good and kind at this moment, and so forth.

609
01:00:38,399 --> 01:00:40,720
I mean, because that's a sacred moment.

610
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:46,880
The sacred moment, remember, keeps its meaning no matter how much other things come in and try to change it.

611
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,439
And Nietzsche doesn't believe in any sacred moment.

612
01:00:49,439 --> 01:00:51,360
We'll come back to that again later.

613
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:54,720
We don't need to talk about it in more detail right yet.

614
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,159
Anybody want to say anything about this?

615
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:02,560
This is the next sort of big chunk of what we should be talking about.

616
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:06,560
So there's the great health, and we've just been reading about the great health.

617
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:11,200
And now they have to relate that to something else.

618
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:16,479
Why is it sort of, why is this, what is this sort of the basis of this health?

619
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:38,119
Why is it important and good, it's sort of the good in Nietzsche, to be constantly outgrowing and convalescing from and taking, leaving behind everything that you were and cared about before.

620
01:01:38,439 --> 01:01:40,200
What's so good about that?

621
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:43,960
Well, we haven't really got that yet, but we will right now.

622
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:53,080
So the bottom line in Nietzsche is that life, life is constant overcoming.

623
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:59,000
Just being alive on 291, 349 aphorism.

624
01:02:06,919 --> 01:02:09,880
Yeah, I would love to have you ask your question.

625
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,000
Yeah.

626
01:02:11,959 --> 01:02:12,600
Yeah.

627
01:02:14,519 --> 01:02:15,800
No, I didn't, did I?

628
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,239
I wondered if anybody would notice.

629
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,200
Good for you.

630
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,720
I find that very hard.

631
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:20,919
Do you know what to say?

632
01:02:20,919 --> 01:02:22,600
The tragedy begins.

633
01:02:22,599 --> 01:02:26,840
Okay, I'll tell you what I think, but I'm not sure.

634
01:02:27,479 --> 01:02:32,919
Tragedy doesn't have to mean, you know, bad stuff.

635
01:02:32,919 --> 01:02:34,439
I'm sure this is right.

636
01:02:34,439 --> 01:02:42,840
I mean, people think now that tragedy is about suffering and not just any old unhappiness, but some kind of necessary suffering.

637
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,079
That's what happens to Oedipus.

638
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:49,399
That's what happens in every tragedy in Hamlet.

639
01:02:49,399 --> 01:02:51,160
There's lots of suffering.

640
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:53,800
People learn from their suffering.

641
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:58,439
But it's not so upbeat.

642
01:02:58,439 --> 01:02:59,959
I mean, but it's already implicit.

643
01:02:59,959 --> 01:03:03,039
But in the first tragedy, I'm thinking, let's go back to Aeschylus.

644
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:04,799
I remember Nietzsche knows all of this.

645
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:18,320
The tragedy of the Oristeia, which my teacher in philosophy fixed, is that through going through a lot of suffering, something utterly new and better comes out of it.

646
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:19,919
You know the Oristea.

647
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:25,600
Suffer, the chorus keeps saying, suffer, suffer, but good comes out in the end.

648
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:28,959
That's a refrain in the Oristeia chorus.

649
01:03:28,959 --> 01:03:31,120
Well, if that's, that would fit this.

650
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:33,839
Suffer from the total collapse of everything.

651
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:36,719
But good will come out in the end.

652
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:40,399
It is, yes, we'll have a new health, we'll be better off.

653
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:41,119
What do you think?

654
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:42,239
Does that make sense?

655
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,320
If not, I don't know what to say.

656
01:03:49,439 --> 01:03:50,159
Hmm.

657
01:03:50,399 --> 01:03:52,320
Then I don't know what to say.

658
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,840
You guys go back to that page.

659
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:56,959
I really don't know what to say.

660
01:03:56,959 --> 01:03:59,439
That was the best I ever came up with right now.

661
01:03:59,439 --> 01:04:00,159
But let's try.

662
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,439
What page are you on?

663
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,439
347.

664
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:07,759
Now, somebody should figure this out, but it must be very hard.

665
01:04:08,399 --> 01:04:15,199
Our visitor here from another university who teaches Nietzsche doesn't know, and I don't know, but let's read it.

666
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,399
I purposely didn't.

667
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:30,320
But on the middle of 347, in spite of all this, it is perhaps only with him, that's the free spirit, that great seriousness really begins, that the real question mark is posed for the first time.

668
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,399
The destiny of the soul changes.

669
01:04:32,399 --> 01:04:34,079
The hand moves forward.

670
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,639
Tragedy begins.

671
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:49,399
It says the reference doesn't have the.

672
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:53,880
I was going to say that it must have to do with Zarathustra, but what it has to do with that.

673
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:55,560
That's another book written by Nietzsche.

674
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:57,479
So, what does it mean?

675
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,439
The destiny?

676
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:02,279
Does it have to do with the eternal return, or what would it have to do?

677
01:05:02,279 --> 01:05:02,919
Okay.

678
01:05:12,039 --> 01:05:15,880
He also all suffering.

679
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:28,919
Even the most free spirit has to go through all kinds of tragic stuff, which is going to end up, presumably, with the triumph of outgrowing in health, I guess.

680
01:05:29,159 --> 01:05:33,959
Anyway, so okay, if you are helpful, what can you do with it?

681
01:05:37,159 --> 01:05:39,319
That's the birth of tragedy.

682
01:05:39,319 --> 01:05:44,760
He left that a long time ago, but that, I mean, this is, you know, that was the first thing he wrote, and this is one of the last.

683
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:46,439
But that doesn't mean that he isn't.

684
01:05:46,999 --> 01:05:48,999
What would he be doing if he were talking about it?

685
01:06:31,919 --> 01:06:39,679
Oh, now we're back in it when we can really experience tragedy in a good sense.

686
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:40,559
Maybe.

687
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:41,519
I mean, I don't know.

688
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:42,880
You're going to say something good, Chrissy.

689
01:06:54,159 --> 01:06:55,199
That's good.

690
01:06:55,199 --> 01:06:55,760
Yeah.

691
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:08,239
Maybe.

692
01:07:08,959 --> 01:07:16,479
One thing, each of these things suffering is important and a good thing, but you end up with something better.

693
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,359
And that's something like that has happened.

694
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,079
The tragedy isn't a bad kind of suffering.

695
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:23,919
It's a good kind of suffering.

696
01:07:23,919 --> 01:07:33,599
And the other kind of suffering that they've been doing for all this time, this self-deceptive happiness and cheerfulness, the divine comedy, that's really sad.

697
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:39,840
What's not sad is facing the suffering somehow and growing because of it.

698
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:42,720
That's the best I can do, too.

699
01:07:44,720 --> 01:08:01,919
And this, you're telling this particular story of how particularly tragedy works to sort of through this merging of the two and to produce something better.

700
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:03,439
Yeah, yeah?

701
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:03,840
Okay.

702
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:14,880
Um you look you're on his side.

703
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:15,119
Good.

704
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:17,319
I'm on his side too, if we can understand it.

705
01:08:20,199 --> 01:08:21,560
370, where?

706
01:08:24,119 --> 01:08:27,159
Okay, okay, let's look at that.

707
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:05,399
That sounds right, that it's tragedy is some kind of good thing.

708
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:14,840
I'm looking down even further, the desire for destruction, change, and becoming can be an expression of overflowing energy that is pregnant with future.

709
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:17,319
My term for this is Dionysia.

710
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:19,159
So you're on the right track.

711
01:09:19,159 --> 01:09:32,119
The Dionysian tragedy is a kind of tragedy which fits with the kind of energy that's constantly destroying what's behind and moving on.

712
01:09:32,119 --> 01:09:34,199
I think that's it's got something to do with that.

713
01:09:34,199 --> 01:09:35,880
Let me write that down.

714
01:09:38,039 --> 01:09:40,680
I'm glad glad you questioned it.

715
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:45,959
So now we want to when he says the tragedy begins, where is that?

716
01:09:53,319 --> 01:09:55,159
347.

717
01:09:55,159 --> 01:09:59,519
Okay, we want to refer ourselves back to 329.

718
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,199
Sounds good.

719
01:09:59,079 --> 01:10:05,199
Here we'll refer to 347.

720
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:13,999
Okay, now I want to just go a little further, because they're kind of loose end unless we go a little further.

721
01:10:13,999 --> 01:10:15,919
And that is, what is life?

722
01:10:15,919 --> 01:10:20,479
Well, we were on 291.

723
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,919
Or really, 280, yes, 291, a very important line.

724
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:28,479
It's not a big deal in this book, but it's a big deal in Nietzsche's mind.

725
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:30,800
So at the bottom.

726
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,800
And it's tied up with tragedy in a way.

727
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:38,479
Because it's going to say sort of destruction and rebirth is what's important.

728
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:49,119
The wish to preserve oneself is a symptom of a condition of distress, of a limitation, of the really fundamental instinct of life, which aims at the expansion of power.

729
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:53,999
And wishing for that frequently risks and even sacrifices self-preservation.

730
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:55,919
And so forth.

731
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:59,840
And then skipping to the bottom of that aphorism.

732
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:11,119
The great and small struggle always resolves around superiority, around growth and expansion, around power in accordance with the will to power, which is the will of life.

733
01:11:11,119 --> 01:11:24,479
So the great health is the happiness that comes from outgrowing what you are and going on to something further, constant or overcoming.

734
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:36,480
And the collapse of the whole Christian, Judeo-Christian Greek thing that the culture has been in for 2,000 years until Nietzsche thinks he should helped collapse it.

735
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:37,760
Of course, he didn't make it collapse.

736
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:40,559
He just saw the collapse and sort of pushed it.

737
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:50,679
But in any case, the collapse of that culture is the greatest overcoming, the most alive, the most terrific thing that could have happened.

738
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:53,959
That's the point of the cheerfulness.

739
01:11:54,279 --> 01:11:59,800
And that's what the free spirits understand.

740
01:12:00,119 --> 01:12:08,519
The free spirits are enjoying the suffering and the collapse.

741
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:10,840
Or more, no, that's not the right word.

742
01:12:10,919 --> 01:12:12,840
They're enjoying what comes after it.

743
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:26,119
They're enjoying the open sea of being able to do something new, something wonderful, not something meaningful, and open up new worlds, as he says.

744
01:12:26,359 --> 01:12:28,119
I'll go back to that next time.

745
01:12:28,119 --> 01:12:30,039
I want to stop now.

746
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:38,919
Just reminding you that next time now is Monday from 5:30 to 7 in Mulford 159.
