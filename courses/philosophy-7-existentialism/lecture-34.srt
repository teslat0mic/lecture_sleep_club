1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,319
But we got to the idea, which is, I'm going to sort of try to stress as we go what's existentialist about some of these ideas.

2
00:00:08,319 --> 00:00:16,319
And at the end, I'll try to tell you something about what I think is characteristic of all existentialism.

3
00:00:16,319 --> 00:00:22,160
But here's one, that it doesn't matter what you believe about what exists.

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,039
There is a question of what you do.

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:36,440
And if you have a childhood memory that lasts a lifetime, then there's eternity and time, there's a forever or you.

6
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:48,199
And if you're in touch with other, with all the other people and you feel like they are loving you and you're loving them, if you behave that way, like Alyasha, that's what counts.

7
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:52,760
And it doesn't matter, remember, what he believes or at all.

8
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,119
Okay, but then what matters is the way of acting.

9
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:04,199
And so Nietzsche, who, like a good any existentialist, understands that, is going to attack the Christian way of acting.

10
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:12,840
And there seem to be two big theses in the Course from the beginning that he definitely attacks.

11
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,400
I mean, and always has his own counter-way of thinking about it.

12
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:32,679
It's just, you have to keep realizing that what's fascinating about Nietzsche is he's reinventing a way of understanding ourselves and our culture and everything about human beings, what's the best way of life, and so forth.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:50,919
He's sort of going against 2,000 years of how people have thought about it since the Greeks, and then making up a new set of values, as he would call it, a new table of values, a new idea of what the good life is.

14
00:01:50,919 --> 00:02:09,559
So the two big ones that I want to sort of talk about briefly at least, how he's going against them, is the view about the self, which we talked about way, way back at the beginning, and the question of unconditional commitment, which we talked about a whole lot in the middle.

15
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:16,679
He's got very different views about the self and about commitment than the others.

16
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,840
But that's all within a certain existentialist way of looking at things, which we'll come back to at the end.

17
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:40,319
Okay, the self, remember, was for the Greeks a kind of disharmony, factors that didn't go together, the mind and the body, the eternal and the worldly.

18
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,960
And remember, for the Greeks, the idea was you get rid of the unessential part of yourself.

19
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:54,720
You cut it out, you repress it, and then if the essential part of yourself is the rational part of yourself, then you just devote yourself to that.

20
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:58,160
And then you have peace and harmony.

21
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:11,679
And the Judeo-Christian view, particularly the Christians, particularly according to Nietzsche, had the same idea that if something or other offends you, well, cast it out.

22
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,200
There was a limit to that.

23
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:22,240
One of the church fathers, Origen, castrated himself on this principle, and the church thought he had gone too far and did not make him a saint.

24
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:33,679
But there is a tendency, certainly, to repress and get rid of whatever doesn't fit in with the spiritual and loving side of the self.

25
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:35,200
But that's the Greek.

26
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,439
That's not the existentialist.

27
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:49,200
Starting with Pascal, you get the idea that to be a self is to be in constant tension, to stretch between the poles of being like an insect and being like an angel.

28
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,799
He already had that.

29
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,519
And to stretch between the poles and fill all the intervening space.

30
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,559
And that was tension.

31
00:03:58,559 --> 00:04:05,160
And Kierkegaard gets the two sides of the self together and wants some kind of equilibrium.

32
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:18,599
But it's not a kind of equilibrium that's peace and harmony because it's going against constant anguish is the test of the Knight of Faith because he's always seeing the sword over the head of the beloved.

33
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:23,799
That is the vulnerability of his or her unconditional commitment.

34
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:33,879
And he's always ready to have to, he always knows that he may at any time have to suspend the ethical and do something which is terrible, even from his own point of view.

35
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:44,200
So, and now, Dostoevsky, oddly enough, on this, I wish it was more systematic, seems to not much have the notion of tension.

36
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:46,920
That is, Dimitri's in constant tension.

37
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:58,759
When he's falling into the pit headfirst and going towards Sodom, he's also singing a hymn to the Madonna, and the self is too broad, and he can't keep it all together.

38
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:05,639
But Dostoevsky thinks that he will eventually, Dimitri, through love, sublimate the dark side.

39
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:26,120
And everybody will be able to have a self when they've been properly loved and properly loving that sublimates all the evil dark side into this love, which makes him more like the Greeks.

40
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:36,360
I mean, I don't see when I read Dostoevsky the kind of tension in the self that Kierkegaard and Pascal have, and Nietzsche certainly has.

41
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:38,840
I'll read you quotes about that in a minute.

42
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,000
I don't think Dostoevsky has it.

43
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:45,160
He has it all right in Dimitri, but he thinks that it's not a good thing.

44
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:55,280
Somehow, if you look at the dark side enough, it will become part of the hooray for Karamatsov, because the earthly and the heavenly will go together.

45
00:05:55,599 --> 00:06:01,919
And that means the self not only in equilibrium, but not in anguish, so forth.

46
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,679
Now, Nietzsche naturally, being Nietzsche, goes against all of that.

47
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:18,160
He wants to keep the dark side, and he wants to keep the tension, and he thinks that evil, that you should incorporate, not sublimate.

48
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,720
You don't cut out the evil part of you.

49
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,000
You don't sublimate it into something else, into purity.

50
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,640
Remember all this talk about the kind of purity that gets rid of the bad side, which is Ivan.

51
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:36,880
You don't even have the kind of purity that sublimates the dark side, like Alyasha.

52
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,440
You actually thrive on the dark side.

53
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,720
It gives you energy.

54
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:45,679
It gives you struggle, and that's all a good thing.

55
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:59,039
On 331, for instance, he says, We, this is aphorism 371, we keep growing and keep changing.

56
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:05,359
And then he says, we shed our bark like a tree and shed our skin every spring.

57
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:07,200
We get younger and fuller.

58
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,640
You recognize that whole Nietzschean constant overcoming in there.

59
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,119
We become younger with Dylan.

60
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,000
I was, what is it?

61
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,199
I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now.

62
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,560
It's a reflection of the new our version of this.

63
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,520
And we get taller and stronger and so forth.

64
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,360
And now comes the interesting one, the bottom of 331, the very bottom, page 331.

65
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:39,720
We push our roots ever more powerfully into the depths, into evil, while at the same time embracing the heavens ever more lovingly.

66
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:48,440
Now that's, you see, sounds more like Dimitri before he got Christianized and existentially loved and all that.

67
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:57,320
He wants to say you should keep the extreme contradictions in the self and spread yourself into them.

68
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:08,920
If you're a free spirit, you shouldn't even try to transform the passions which are chaotic and make them equilibrium-like and get peace.

69
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:12,360
Peace in your life is what Nietzsche just doesn't want.

70
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,120
That's weakness.

71
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:17,320
No harmony, no peace.

72
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:23,400
He just rejects the whole Greek and the Greek eyes Christian tradition.

73
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:37,000
The best you should do is organize your passions so that there's a kind of constrained, dynamic, unstable unity that you have to keep struggling to control.

74
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,520
That makes you powerful.

75
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,360
That makes you creative.

76
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:57,720
I think his favorite figure is certainly not the saint, but the artist who is supposedly always trying to take over more and more, which is evil, at least in the sense of original, and going against the way everybody did things before.

77
00:08:57,719 --> 00:09:07,800
And in their selves, they have these powerful impulses which they don't want to get rid of, which are sort of fueling their passion in their work.

78
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:15,080
So just to see that, you show you see this in Twilight on 54.

79
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:27,039
And now notice, I mean, the self is a contradiction, according to Kierkegaard.

80
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:34,800
But it's a contradiction that you get at least into an unstable unity, but it's a kind of unity that you buy at a high price.

81
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:39,039
But for Nietzsche, the self is a contradiction, period.

82
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:41,600
You don't ever get out of the contradiction.

83
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,360
And it's a good thing.

84
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,320
15 lines down on 54.

85
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:51,200
One is fruitful only at the cost of being rich in contradictions.

86
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,960
One remains young only on condition that the soul does not relax, does not long for peace.

87
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:05,999
Peace is such a big deal in the Greek and in the Christian, and then in this sort of Judeo-Christian thing.

88
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,640
Now, I don't know about you, but I learned at various points two prayers, both of which were all about peace.

89
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,880
I think there's a pair that begins, grant us peace, thy most precious gift.

90
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,799
And I don't know how many know that prayer.

91
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:20,400
I don't know where I got that.

92
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,839
And what's another one?

93
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:22,720
Let's see.

94
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,919
Now I lay me down in peace, and so forth and so forth and so forth.

95
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,960
There seems to be this obsession with peace, as if that was such a big deal, good thing.

96
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,680
Nietzsche would say, that's just boring.

97
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:45,680
And what's exciting is, why don't you pray, grant me excitement and struggle and the strength to hold together all the most diverse parts of my personality.

98
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,360
Nobody prays that except Nietzscheans, but it sounds like a good thing to pray.

99
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,359
So we don't long for peace.

100
00:10:53,360 --> 00:11:02,160
Nothing has grown more alien to us than that desideratum of former times, peace of soul, the Christian desideratum.

101
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,320
Isn't the end of the Mass about peace, too?

102
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:06,600
I'm thinking of that.

103
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,280
Yet, give us peace, right?

104
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,840
That's the very last lines of the Mass, I believe.

105
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:11,559
Anybody know?

106
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,079
Nobody must know.

107
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:20,920
When you hear music of the Mass, Dona Novis Pachem is the Pachem is the very last word of the Mass, I believe.

108
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:24,599
So it doesn't surprise me, and it wouldn't surprise Nietzsche.

109
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:30,039
But it doesn't make him, he certainly makes him feel that this is not a good way to go.

110
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:43,559
So, and in the Antichrist on 190, he talks about there's a lot more about struggle in the self and how to keep it struggling and how to make the struggle fruitful in other things by Nietzsche, other books that we don't read.

111
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,719
So, I didn't put them in.

112
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:49,960
But here's another funny thing which struck me just this morning for the first time.

113
00:11:49,959 --> 00:12:03,240
I mean, just as I said, and I think it's so interesting that Dimitri is a Nietzschean, while he's going crazy at the beginning as a walking contradiction, trying to get this broad self into a peaceful balance.

114
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:10,360
Whereas, and Dostoevsky thinks you've got to overcome that, Nietzsche would like Dimitri at the beginning.

115
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,520
See if you can figure out who Nietzsche would like for this one, the middle of 190.

116
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:20,280
The most spiritual human beings, as the strongest, find their happiness where others would find their destruction.

117
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,240
We're 190 of Antichrist.

118
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:34,760
In the labyrinth, in severity toward themselves and others, in attempting, their joy lies in self-constraint, with their asceticism becomes nature, indeed instinct.

119
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,359
And now, this is the neat part.

120
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:43,880
They consider the hard task to privilege, to play with vices, which overwhelms others.

121
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:50,880
They consider the hard task a privilege, to play with vices, which overwhelms others, a recreation.

122
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,400
Who considers playing with vices a recreation?

123
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,480
I never realized.

124
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,200
And of course, from Dostoevsky's point of view, not a good thing to be doing.

125
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,199
Have you remember?

126
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:06,959
Who plays with devils?

127
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,479
No, no, Ricky is a devil.

128
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,680
But that's all right.

129
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:12,960
You're on the right track.

130
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,880
No, no, somebody, what?

131
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:15,999
Lisa.

132
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,640
Good, yes.

133
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:28,400
Remember, she has this game she plays where she dreams of devils or conjures up devils, and when they're just about to take her over, she crosses herself and they go away again.

134
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,920
I mean, a recreation of playing with vices.

135
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,400
And of course, playing with her sadism too, slamming the door on her thumb and so forth.

136
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:46,880
These are not things that Dostoevsky would admire, but if you took this definition literally, Lisa turns out to be able to play with vices that would overwhelm others.

137
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,960
But this is just how radically strange to the tradition Nietzsche is.

138
00:13:53,280 --> 00:14:02,720
So, just to sum up that aria, is spiritualization is repression is in Plato.

139
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:05,520
The self denies half the self.

140
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,560
And that's one way of getting peace.

141
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:11,200
Spiritualization is sublimation.

142
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,280
That's Dostoevsky and purity, the right kind of purity.

143
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,880
And that gives you, again, I think, peace and joy.

144
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,160
I don't see any anguish in Father Zosima.

145
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:34,919
And then Nietzschean spiritualization, he would use the same term, I think, where it's controlled chaos and integrating evil at any level.

146
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,240
Okay, any comments about that?

147
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,800
I feel bad because I think that's such an interesting issue.

148
00:14:47,000 --> 00:15:06,840
But I don't know where to find a, I was looking this morning where Nietzsche talks about it, but I know that he has this view that at any given time some passion or other is the dominant one, and it fits for this occasion, but on some other occasion, some other passion, which is absolutely incompatible with that one, is the dominant one.

149
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:17,240
And what you want to be is the kind of person who has a lot of passions and somehow manages to get the right one on top, controlling things in each situation.

150
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,039
Yeah.

151
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,960
Well, I wonder, you're right to ask.

152
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:27,079
So Kierkegaard, can somebody close that door back there?

153
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:29,160
That's going to get us eventually.

154
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,640
I hear people running by talking.

155
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,840
Well, unless it's too hot, you want it open?

156
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:37,240
Are you all right?

157
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,039
Let's close it.

158
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:41,479
If anybody gets suffocated, let me know.

159
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:52,039
So spirit does so Kierkegaard, the finite is the infinite, the temporal and eternal, the possible.

160
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,160
In Kierkegaard, you want to integrate them in an unconditioned passion.

161
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:14,360
Getting mixed up in Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, in an unconditional commitment, you manage to give fullest expression to the finite and the infinite, to the temporal and the eternal, to the possible and necessary, so that they support each other.

162
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,679
So that's integration.

163
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:19,160
He's got integration without peace.

164
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:20,880
That's what makes him interesting.

165
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,640
But I have trouble sort of getting them all together in any chart.

166
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,080
But the integration in Kierkegaard is total.

167
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,080
I mean, there's no contradiction anymore.

168
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,880
The self is...

169
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,800
stops being a contradiction when you get an unconditional commitment.

170
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,479
You get out of the despair that you were in when you were a contradiction.

171
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:44,160
However, you get it at the cost of anguish so that you don't ever get peace.

172
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:55,040
Kierkegaard talks about the self when its full self as constantly swimming over 40,000 fathoms.

173
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:06,479
I mean, that's just another strenuous idea that there's no ground and no rest if you're going to get yourself together at the best life that a person can have.

174
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:07,759
Does that help?

175
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:08,719
Okay.

176
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,880
I better go on because I'm not sure.

177
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:17,360
The next big deal, and we're right at it, so we'll do it, is unconditional commitment.

178
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,319
That's a big thing in Kierkegaard.

179
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:30,160
And he gets it out of already Jesus asking the disciples to be ready to die for him and saying if he'd be ready to die for them, does, and so forth.

180
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:38,319
And total commitment is something that goes all through the Judeo-Christian tradition.

181
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,840
I don't find much talk about commitment, I mean, or in Dostoevsky.

182
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:50,560
It's somehow you're committed to, so remember I said love the one you're with.

183
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,759
You don't want to get totally committed to any one person.

184
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:58,959
That takes you away from being able to love everybody.

185
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:04,160
Just as Alyasha's total commitment, he did have unconditional commitment to Zosima.

186
00:18:04,439 --> 00:18:13,479
And when he did, he got so upset when Zosima was dying that he forgot to take care of Dimitri and then wasn't doing his angel job at all.

187
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:19,959
And so individual commitments seem not to be something that Dostoevsky thinks you should be stuck with.

188
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:22,039
You should outgrow them.

189
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,519
He sounds almost like Nietzsche there.

190
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:42,679
But there's something which takes the place of unconditional commitments, namely childhood memories, something which is settled, whose meaning is settled for the rest of your life, which you can't betray without betraying yourself.

191
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:45,959
That there's something that is forever.

192
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,560
It's just a peculiar something.

193
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,999
It's not a risky commitment to an individual.

194
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:58,439
So anyway, I can't make all these people neatly fit together, but they've all got this common concerns.

195
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:11,799
The important thing is to see that Nietzsche, as you would expect when you get used to it, totally overturns any notion of unconditional commitment, any notion of eternity and time.

196
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:14,919
All that is, of course, weakness.

197
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:21,560
It's weakness if you think that the highest thing in life is constant overcoming, outgrowing, and so forth.

198
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:33,959
The big enemy is an unconditional commitment, something that you are going to have to believe and do, act on, never mind believe, act on forever.

199
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:42,679
So let's look at it on Twilight 184 is where he comes down on his notion on commitments.

200
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:44,759
Here they're called convictions.

201
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:51,360
I think maybe convictions is a little more intellectual than commitment, but I think the idea is the same.

202
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:54,400
So I'm going to just call it commitment and read it that way.

203
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:54,880
I don't know.

204
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:57,520
I didn't try to go back and look at the German.

205
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:58,880
It would be fun to see if I could.

206
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,559
I'll leave this message to myself.

207
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,679
Go back and check the German, see if you could make it mean commitment.

208
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,799
Now, in the meantime, I'm just going to do it.

209
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,719
Okay, the middle of 184.

210
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:11,039
Freedom from commitments of any kind.

211
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,360
The capacity for an unconstrained view pertains to strength.

212
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,719
Grand Passion, the ground and force of his being.

213
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:25,120
Even more enlightened, more despotic than himself, than he himself is, takes his whole intellect into his service.

214
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,239
This is bad.

215
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,640
This kind of grand passion.

216
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,200
It makes him, no, well, maybe it isn't.

217
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:32,239
No, no, sorry.

218
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:41,200
The grand passion is fine, but it's what you get when you have freedom from commitments.

219
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,679
Grand passion, the ground and force of his being.

220
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,759
This is the free spirit.

221
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:52,239
Even more, ever, even more enlightened, more despotic than he himself is, takes his whole intellect into its service.

222
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:53,439
It makes him intrepid.

223
00:20:53,439 --> 00:20:55,759
It gives him the courage for unholy means.

224
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,360
Evil again.

225
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,840
If need be, it permits him convictions and commitments.

226
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,959
That's important.

227
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:05,280
Remember, I said that in passing last time.

228
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:13,519
There's nothing wrong with commitments, except that you've got to treat them as means, not as ends, so that you can outgrow them.

229
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:21,360
I may have said this when my students came up with the slogan: stick with it, but don't get stuck with it for any commitment.

230
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:28,560
You stick with it for a while, but when it becomes time and you're strong enough, you leave it behind.

231
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,919
Let me go on here.

232
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:32,799
Commitment as a means.

233
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,800
There is much one can achieve only by means of commitment.

234
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,760
Grand Passion uses and uses up commitments.

235
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:40,040
It does not submit to them.

236
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,999
It knows itself sovereign.

237
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:51,799
And then, and the need for belief or something unconditional, so forth, that's a bad thing, it turns out.

238
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:56,599
It is a requirement of weakness underlined.

239
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,599
So you see what he's up to.

240
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:02,999
And now, yeah, that's.

241
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:05,079
And of course, I just said it, but I'll say it again.

242
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:10,519
And why does Nietzsche think that we should be strong and get over our commitments?

243
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,759
Well, why?

244
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,360
Well, it's built into what it is to be alive.

245
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,719
That's how he does it.

246
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,839
It's not a question of what we should do.

247
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,919
There's nothing in the universe on which to base an ethics.

248
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,999
It's just what any healthy person does.

249
00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:40,279
And if you aren't doing it, you're weak and sick, and you don't even deserve to be alive.

250
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:49,640
That's that may that I don't know what to call that when you build your ethics into the universe like that, but that's how Nietzsche does it.

251
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:54,679
So I've told you now that having commitments is strong.

252
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:57,959
Now look on 127 of Twilight.

253
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,760
And I believe, I don't know why I've got that.

254
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,120
We read it.

255
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,400
It's important, but it isn't what I want to read right now.

256
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:13,479
Let's look at the Gay Science 100.

257
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,599
There are lots of places like this, but I've read this one too, but it's just important.

258
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,719
What is life?

259
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:26,240
Life that is continually shedding something that wants to die.

260
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:34,640
Life that is being cruel and inexorable against everything about us that is growing old and weak, and not only about us.

261
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:43,999
Life that is being without reverence to those who are dying, who are wretched, who are ancient, constantly being a murderer, and so forth.

262
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:48,239
That's Nietzsche, his outrageous.

263
00:23:50,719 --> 00:24:00,239
And if you want something as firm and eternal as the vault of heaven, to talk like Dostoevsky, that just means you aren't strong.

264
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:07,199
You've got to, either you're just weak and you're hopeless, or you have to outgrow it.

265
00:24:07,199 --> 00:24:13,919
At the bottom of 287 in gay science, number 347.

266
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:27,679
Believers and their need to believe, how much one needs a faith in order to flourish, how much that is firm, and that one does not wish to be shaken, firm as the vault of heaven, because one clings to it.

267
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:34,239
That is the measure of the degree of one's strength, or to put the point more clearly, of one's weakness.

268
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:39,039
That's pretty clear.

269
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:52,239
And once you're strong enough, you always see your commitments and convictions as errors, that you had them because they were necessary for you to believe in the past.

270
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:54,079
I mean, take the extreme case.

271
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:02,160
I believe you may need to believe in an afterlife, Nietzsche would think, because you're just not strong enough to face the fact that once you're dead, you're dead.

272
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:07,559
But if you get strong enough to face that fact, then you will need to believe in the afterlife.

273
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:11,880
And since there's no evidence one way or the other, you won't believe in it.

274
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:17,880
Convictions are necessary, and you have to, it's not a question of what you should do.

275
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,719
You have to hang on to them while you're weak and need them.

276
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:24,200
And you will give them up when you're strong.

277
00:25:24,199 --> 00:25:25,959
You'll just outgrow them.

278
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:32,919
He talks about this on 245 of the gay science.

279
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:34,040
It's a funny quote.

280
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,000
I really like it.

281
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:41,640
It's so weirdly something at the bottom of 245.

282
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:49,479
Now, something formerly loved as a truth or probability strikes you as an error.

283
00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:53,880
You shed it and fancy that this represents a victory for your reason.

284
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,759
But perhaps this error was necessary for you then when you were still a different person.

285
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:00,679
You're always a different person.

286
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:09,719
As are all your present truths, being a skin, as it were, that conceals and covered a great deal that you were not yet permitted to see.

287
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:15,160
What killed that opinion for you was your new life and not your reason.

288
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,239
You no longer need it.

289
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:21,880
And now it collapses and unreason crawls out of it into the light like a worm.

290
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,080
That is so weird.

291
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:30,439
I mean, that's that, you realize that it was never reasonable once you get strong enough to see it.

292
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:34,999
When we criticize something, this is no arbitrary and impersonal event.

293
00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:43,160
It is, at least very often, evidence of a vital energy, evidence of vital energies in us that are growing and shedding a skin.

294
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:55,279
I mean, this talk about constantly shedding the skin, which has sort of now become too confining, is Nietzsche's main picture of this outgrowing of your convictions.

295
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:06,400
Okay, so that's the second big thing, a big doctrine or pillar of the Judeo-Christian tradition that Nietzsche is going after.

296
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:22,080
So, the self and the idea that you should achieve some kind of harmony and peace as the highest way to be a self, that seems to be absolutely solid in the tradition, in Dostoevsky, even, and he's shooting it down.

297
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,759
That was the first point I made.

298
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:35,279
And now that people should have unconditional commitments that give them forever, that give them eternity and time, that give them something in their lives as solid as the vault of heaven.

299
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:42,640
Now, Nietzsche is not only saying that's not necessary, he's saying that's positively bad.

300
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,439
That simply shows weakness.

301
00:27:45,439 --> 00:27:48,319
And if you're strong, you outgrow it.

302
00:27:48,640 --> 00:28:01,279
To put it in a funny way, what would Nietzsche say to Dostoevsky and Dmitry's childhood memory of the nuts that the old German doctor gave him?

303
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:09,840
Well, he'd say, Well, to Dmitry, yeah, that was a tremendously important experience when you were a lonely kid, but now you're a growing man.

304
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,280
Forget it, outgrow it.

305
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:16,799
What are you doing thinking that it's something that you should have so important in your life?

306
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,439
Now you're a different person, and so forth.

307
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:27,360
You're just two different pictures of what kind of stability you want.

308
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,240
Okay, that's the second unit.

309
00:28:30,239 --> 00:28:37,319
Now, the third thing I want to talk about is what's happening in our culture.

310
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:48,919
I think all the existentialists share a common belief that the Enlightenment is a big mistake and is a disaster.

311
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:58,199
Whether you're, and that's what's in one of the interesting things that unites Dostoevsky and Nietzsche completely, and Kierkegaard, because the Enlightenment for him is in Hegel.

312
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:04,120
So that's a very interesting thing they have in common.

313
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,880
You don't have to be an existentialist to think the Enlightenment was a disaster.

314
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,799
It's a wider held view among some intellectuals.

315
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,919
But it's certainly central to all these people.

316
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,239
So what does that mean?

317
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:24,679
Well, one, they are anti-Greek, all of them.

318
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:27,000
They're anti-Plato, all of them.

319
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:28,760
But that's not the Enlightenment yet.

320
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:55,799
The Enlightenment is this time in the 1600s when Descartes comes along and declares that the self is autonomous, that everybody, and it sort of gets finished in Kant, I've talked about these people, where everybody should be an autonomous, free, self-sufficient person who decides on what's right and wrong and who takes responsibility for what they do and so forth.

321
00:29:56,199 --> 00:30:03,160
That picture, and the whole culture should decide what's right and wrong and take responsibility for what it does.

322
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,199
And human beings progress that way.

323
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:12,679
They become self-legislating, autonomous.

324
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:14,839
They give the law to themselves.

325
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:26,240
They set up the institutions in the culture that they want to have, presumably democracy and free enterprise, and then progress and so forth.

326
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:29,360
So Nietzsche thinks, doesn't like any of that.

327
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,360
So you look at 339 in the gay science.

328
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,760
No, we don't need 339.

329
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:37,439
Look at 338.

330
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:47,199
This isn't something I've spent much time on because sort of political stuff isn't the big issue for most existentialists.

331
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:52,800
And it isn't something that Kierkegaard, oh, sorry, Nietzsche spends much time on.

332
00:30:52,800 --> 00:31:02,160
But his view about the Enlightenment values comes out in the middle of 338, aphorism 377.

333
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:04,960
He says, we conserve nothing.

334
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:07,999
Neither do we want to return to any past periods.

335
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,840
We are by no means liberal.

336
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,919
We do not work for progress.

337
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,759
These are we free thinkers.

338
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:19,279
We do not need to plug up our ears against the sirens who in the marketplace sing of the future.

339
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,199
Their song about equal rights.

340
00:31:21,199 --> 00:31:24,960
These are all the things that we believe in, which the Free Spirit doesn't.

341
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:32,079
Their songs about equal rights, a free society, no more masters and no more servants, has no allure for us.

342
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:39,279
We simply do not consider it desirable that a realm of justice and concord should be established on earth.

343
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,679
That is really amazing.

344
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:53,839
I mean, Nietzsche is just outside of everything, outside of that whole tradition that believes in democracy and progress and justice and equal rights.

345
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,999
The Free Spirit doesn't care about that.

346
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:57,999
That's just not what's important.

347
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,679
What's important is what?

348
00:31:59,999 --> 00:32:11,640
To be able to reinvent yourself, to invent new worlds, to sort of destroy the current society and the current laws and the current institutions and set up new ones.

349
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,239
You've got to outgrow everything.

350
00:32:15,239 --> 00:32:27,480
So that's a very powerful strange to us, most people, most sort of Western liberal humanitarian people, that Nietzsche is always coming up.

351
00:32:27,719 --> 00:32:30,279
He's always taking the counter position.

352
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:40,039
And now, here's something, however, that he and Dostoevsky and Kierkegaard can all agree on.

353
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,600
That these Enlightenment values are coming to an end, they think.

354
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,800
That we're going into a period of nihilism.

355
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,079
That God is dead.

356
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:54,520
God supports progress and justice and equality and all these good things.

357
00:32:54,520 --> 00:33:00,760
And the belief in them has been strong, but not anymore, according to them.

358
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:11,960
So for Nietzsche and Yvonne, and when the Enlightenment comes to an end, it will be a geological cataclysm.

359
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:26,199
Because all the values of equality and justice and progress and rationality and so forth will disappear because there'll be no God around to prop them up anymore.

360
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:27,719
That's the picture.

361
00:33:27,719 --> 00:33:32,440
And so for Nietzsche and Yvonne, that's great.

362
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,480
The geological cataclysm is followed by what?

363
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:46,360
The men have to, the people have to become gods, invent their own values, and so forth.

364
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:54,800
So the idea is for Nietzsche and Ivan, the Enlightenment overcomes itself, and that's good.

365
00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:00,320
Just like when Christianity overcomes itself and kills God, that's good.

366
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:23,760
And the Enlightenment overcomes itself, I guess, because belief in truth and reason and so forth finally comes to see that there is no basis for truth and that reasons are just always rationalizations, to put that story about what happens when you outgrow something that you thought was reasonable.

367
00:34:23,759 --> 00:34:28,959
So all the values of the Enlightenment somehow would have to self-destruct.

368
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,960
And I bet somewhere in Nietzsche you can see how they undermine themselves.

369
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,559
But in any case, the Enlightenment is collapsing.

370
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:44,400
And Dostoevsky thinks, yeah, the Enlightenment is collapsing, and he thinks that's a good thing.

371
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:56,000
But not because the Enlightenment has then overcome itself and some new world of more struggle and more evil and therefore more exciting and more interesting is coming around.

372
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,600
He thinks that's because when the Enlightenment collapses, it's going to destroy everything and everybody.

373
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,799
Because people are not capable of being gods.

374
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,679
So, and Dostoevsky would say, Nietzsche, he's just part of the Enlightenment.

375
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:19,440
He's an individualist, a willful person, and sort of he's just part of this autonomous tradition.

376
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:26,480
He says, for instance, you should have the strength not to serve something higher than yourself.

377
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,120
All these religious people are weak because they serve something higher than themselves.

378
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:40,199
Dostoevsky would say, if you've got enough strength, I suppose, but that wouldn't be his main thing.

379
00:35:40,279 --> 00:35:54,439
If you have enough sensibility to the way people are related, you will serve something greater than yourself, namely the interconnectedness of everything, namely God, in his particular understanding of God.

380
00:35:54,759 --> 00:36:06,440
But he thinks that what Nietzsche shows, this is what Dostoevsky would say, is that natural human beings are just like Nietzsche says healthy human beings are.

381
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,160
They use everything to enhance their freedom.

382
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,279
They're proud.

383
00:36:10,279 --> 00:36:11,560
They're evil.

384
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,000
They're selfish.

385
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,999
And Nietzsche is making a virtue of all that.

386
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:34,520
But really, that's what man is like if the Christian love that Markle experiences and passes on to Zostima and passes on to Alyasha doesn't come to change human nature.

387
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:38,679
Nietzsche is describing sinful fallen man.

388
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:55,879
And that's, from Dostoevsky's point of view, that's exactly what will take over when the Enlightenment ends, if Christianity doesn't take over, which is the only other hope, you know, the star that rises in the East.

389
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:08,360
Nietzsche would say that Dostoevsky's experiences of love and connectedness and eternity show weakness, and that's why Dostoevsky clings to them, that he should outgrow being a meaning at it.

390
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:18,039
And Dostoevsky would say, meaning, identity, love, forever, that is childhood memories, are absolutely crucial.

391
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,719
Without it, humanity would destroy itself.

392
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:24,480
That's the constant worry that he's got.

393
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,640
Okay, that's the other piece of what's important.

394
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:41,280
How they agree about the Enlightenment and how they agree that we'd better get out of the Enlightenment and how they're happy insofar as the Enlightenment's going to collapse.

395
00:37:41,279 --> 00:37:43,440
But they go in opposite directions.

396
00:37:43,440 --> 00:38:01,519
Total freedom and power and domination of your own instincts and everybody else and on the one hand in Nietzsche and openness to God's love flowing through the universe in Dostoevsky.

397
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,879
And Kierkegaard just doesn't think much about these political things.

398
00:38:04,879 --> 00:38:12,479
He thinks only about what individuals have to do in relation to other individuals, so I can't really bring him into this.

399
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:15,839
Okay, now, where are we?

400
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,640
Well, where we are is that the question is, well, who's right?

401
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,800
I mean, I've just given you two complete, or are they both wrong?

402
00:38:24,799 --> 00:38:39,520
They certainly can't both be right about all these things, about whether we need eternity in time, about whether we should sublimate evil or integrate evil in ourselves, and a million other things.

403
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,839
The interesting thing is that, or furthermore, here's another thing.

404
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:48,320
Who's right about the way to the future?

405
00:38:48,319 --> 00:39:01,360
Nietzsche says we're all going to become, Nietzsche and Yvonne, and Yvonne's devil say the wave of the future is lots of free spirits, lots of super people who have become gods.

406
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:04,160
And Dostoevsky says, what is the way to the future?

407
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,479
It's alearchy teaching the boys.

408
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:23,880
We're going to go out into the world, and the star will rise in the east, and we will have a Christian society, a Christian socialism, which is that is the only kind of, you can only have that once everybody's human nature has been transformed.

409
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,400
So, how do you decide?

410
00:39:30,279 --> 00:39:49,880
And or, let me just read some of the ways I kind of summed it up at one point.

411
00:39:49,879 --> 00:39:55,400
Okay, for Nietzsche, now that God is dead, all things are possible if we only see it.

412
00:39:55,399 --> 00:40:05,080
And for Dostoevsky, we're in paradise here and now if we'd only love everybody and see it.

413
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:31,080
But the question we're trying to figure out: how would you decide whether the current collapse of the old values is the first sign of a new freedom and a new man, where the new man is arising, or is it the beginning of the cataclysm which won't end until we get back in touch with love and connectedness, which is Dostoevsky?

414
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:40,279
Or is the Enlightenment doing fine, progressing towards global peace and democracy, like the Swiss in The Third Man?

415
00:40:40,279 --> 00:40:47,079
And maybe you do have to give up Leonardo and the Da Vinci's and Michelangelo.

416
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:51,519
Maybe it's worth giving them up for 2,000 years of peace and democracy.

417
00:40:48,759 --> 00:40:53,199
That's another possibility.

418
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,719
Three powerful interpretations.

419
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:02,080
Okay, now comes, I think, Nietzsche's most amazing and interesting move.

420
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,559
He's got one more move up his sleeve.

421
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,279
This is a philosophical sounding issue.

422
00:41:07,279 --> 00:41:08,800
Well, who is right?

423
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,239
And where would you go to find out?

424
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:12,000
How would you decide who is right?

425
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,479
Particularly since they all question reason as going to tell you who's right.

426
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,719
Well, maybe not the Enlightenment people, the others.

427
00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:20,239
But they can't agree on anything.

428
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:24,960
They are so different interpretations that they can't even argue with each other.

429
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,679
So what do you do?

430
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:27,520
Just flip a coin?

431
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,440
Well, that's possible.

432
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,160
Or just believe whatever you happen to believe.

433
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,319
Well, Nietzsche's got another move.

434
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:39,679
He sees that it's the kind of question to which you can't give an answer.

435
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:46,880
That is, there are different total interpretations, and there's no way to negotiate between them.

436
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:52,319
I mean, you can just fall back on revealing experiences and sort of pound on the table.

437
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:57,600
Dostoevsky's got his revealing experience that Alex Hawke has in the middle of the book.

438
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:04,239
And if you really, if that experience really gets you in touch with the connectedness of everything, well, then that's it.

439
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:11,760
Or Nietzsche has his equally kind of revealing experience, only it's metaphysical more than religious.

440
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:21,360
He experiences life as constant overcoming and as the highest principle that is the test of everything.

441
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:29,440
And of course, if you believe that, if you have some kind of metaphysical revelation of that kind of Nietzschean sort, then everything follows.

442
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,920
But that's not going to help.

443
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,160
So what's the last surprising move?

444
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:41,640
I doubt if any of you see it, because it sort of doesn't get a big play here, but it's so interesting.

445
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:46,760
Well, he just changes the rules of the game, the rules of the debate.

446
00:42:46,759 --> 00:42:57,880
And he says this is not a question of deciding in some rational way or even appealing to some kind of revelation, finally.

447
00:42:57,879 --> 00:42:59,879
It's an aesthetic question.

448
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:05,400
It's, oddly enough, not a question of truth, but a question of taste.

449
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:19,000
This whole big thing I've been telling you, what seems to be this huge choice, turns into in Nietzsche, and you can see why, that is, you're going to believe whatever you're strong enough to believe.

450
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,160
And that's going to be not because you argued it.

451
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,400
Remember the thing about criticism.

452
00:43:26,759 --> 00:43:34,199
What we want to know is what can people, what truth can people stand now?

453
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,640
Something like that.

454
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:41,000
On page 106, number 39.

455
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:45,160
The change in general taste is more powerful than that of opinions.

456
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:59,080
Opinions, along with all proofs, refutations, and the whole intellectual masquerade are merely symptoms of a change in taste, and most certainly not what they are still often supposed to be, its causes.

457
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:11,080
So it's not that we're going to try to find out who's right and think that that's what's causing things to go in such and such a direction or belief to go in such and such a direction.

458
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:23,679
What we're going to find out is the change in taste, and that's going to be, in effect, a change in how strong an interpretation people can have.

459
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:26,640
Let me find, I'll show you another one, 186.

460
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:49,359
This just comes up every once in a while, but he really has, he really thinks the move is, in other words, just so you get it, is not whether the whole Judeo-Christian tradition is wrong, but whether people like it or not, whether it seems plausible to people, whether it seems sort of, I don't know what, I can't find a right word.

461
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:54,400
Honorable is too Greek, true is too philosophical.

462
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:58,400
Whether it's, and wonderful can't do either, that's Nietzsche.

463
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:05,359
Whether, I don't know, it's a good thing, whether it makes life worth living.

464
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,679
Let's try something neutralized.

465
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:19,360
To decide which of these views makes life worth living is a question of taste, he says, at the top of 186, aphorism 132.

466
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:24,960
What is now decisive against Christianity is our taste, no longer our reasons.

467
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,560
And that's the final Trump argument.

468
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:33,679
Now, you can't really see yet that it's a final Trump argument, but I'm going to help you see in a minute.

469
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:48,320
So Nietzsche says that given the way our culture has developed, we might go on believing in love, connectedness, and morality and meaning.

470
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:53,440
Or we might, if we're a healthy, strong culture, outgrow it.

471
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:59,199
And there is evidence that we've outgrown it, or we're beginning to outgrow it, the middle of 340.

472
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:09,719
I mean, this is in a way, partly we've become a secular culture, but it's still really off on the horizon that we've become an anti-enlightenment culture.

473
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:11,479
But this is about Christianity now.

474
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,040
So he says, the middle of 340.

475
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:22,120
We have also outgrown Christianity and are adverse to it precisely because we've outgrown it.

476
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,760
So it's not a question that's true or false.

477
00:46:24,759 --> 00:46:27,640
It's a question of whether you need it.

478
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:34,840
And human beings have become sufficiently strong in the West, finally, that they don't need it anymore.

479
00:46:34,839 --> 00:46:36,679
So they're going to stop believing it.

480
00:46:36,679 --> 00:46:38,359
Never mind arguing about it.

481
00:46:38,759 --> 00:46:41,000
As long as they need it, they're going to believe it.

482
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:48,520
And as soon as they don't need it, they're going to see that it's just a desire that they had, that they had to believe it.

483
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:52,040
And that's all that's going to happen.

484
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:57,640
Don 287, 347.

485
00:46:59,879 --> 00:47:01,400
Didn't I just read that?

486
00:47:01,399 --> 00:47:03,240
How much one needs a faith?

487
00:47:03,879 --> 00:47:05,000
Did I read that?

488
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:05,799
That's what I thought.

489
00:47:05,799 --> 00:47:06,920
Well, I'll read it again.

490
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,959
How much one needs a faith in order to flourish?

491
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:15,800
How much that is firm, that one does not wish to be shaken because one clings to it.

492
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:20,600
That is the measure of the degree of one's strength, or to put the point more clearly of one's weakness.

493
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,199
It was better to read it further.

494
00:47:22,359 --> 00:47:24,600
I'm going to cross it out here.

495
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:27,879
Let's try 288.

496
00:47:27,879 --> 00:47:30,520
Is that going to be something I also read?

497
00:47:30,839 --> 00:47:31,559
No.

498
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:38,360
But it's not all that interesting either.

499
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:47,080
But I'll read it because it's got to do with, again, the faults of heaven and the firmness of belief and conviction, commitment.

500
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,839
Three lines down on 288.

501
00:47:49,040 --> 00:48:01,279
The demand that one wants by all means that something should be firm, while on account of it, the ardor of this demand, one is easier and more negligent about the demonstration of this certainty.

502
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:13,600
This too is still a demand for support, a prop, in short, an instinct of weakness, which to be sure does not create religions and metaphysical systems and convictions of all kinds, but conserves them.

503
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:18,480
And the question is: have we outgrown it or are we outgrowing it?

504
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,480
So now comes the interesting move.

505
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,160
How would we find out?

506
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:28,240
Well, we find out in the sense that you already know the answer.

507
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:33,360
Each of you sort of individually, but mostly collectively, as a class.

508
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,520
That is, you are the answer.

509
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:56,240
That is the I've I've been taking this poll over 30 years and there is definitely a change in which of these views people like, people, what their taste is, which they find attractive, let's put it that way, and we try to find a new niche-like word, and which they don't find attractive.

510
00:48:56,239 --> 00:49:03,679
So now I'm just going to take a poll, so to speak, and see where you are on this chart.

511
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:10,799
So, okay, we've got somebody will somebody come up here and write on the board for me?

512
00:49:10,799 --> 00:49:13,919
You know that I can't write so that anybody could read it.

513
00:49:14,399 --> 00:49:15,280
Thanks.

514
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,880
Okay, qu number one.

515
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:34,160
So how many would believe in traditional Platonized Christianity, which means with a Creator God and probably an afterlife and so forth?

516
00:49:36,759 --> 00:49:42,600
I'm really interested in this one because I think it may be having a comeback, but we'll just have to get numbers.

517
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,800
So how many?

518
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,319
Help me count.

519
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:50,600
Let's really hide your hands because it's fascinating to see.

520
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:56,040
And if you don't support Christianity, it'll get voted against.

521
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:03,160
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

522
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,280
Yeah, okay.

523
00:50:04,279 --> 00:50:08,760
So now we can't tell what that means yet until we see how it relates to the others.

524
00:50:08,759 --> 00:50:12,679
So now we've got two kinds of existentialized Christianity.

525
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:15,160
And we want to see what's happening to them.

526
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:33,160
So how about how many think the Kierkegaard's right, that the highest form of life is an unconditional commitment to one other something or other, person or cause, and that is the only thing that can save human beings from despair, and that will give you a really rich, meaningful life.

527
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:36,199
Risky and anxious, but satisfying.

528
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,800
Okay, let's see.

529
00:50:37,799 --> 00:50:40,119
Okay, when you kind of count the Kierkegaardians.

530
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,679
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, I think.

531
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:47,719
What do you think?

532
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:48,759
Nine, maybe.

533
00:50:48,759 --> 00:50:50,760
I felt I might be missing somebody.

534
00:50:50,759 --> 00:50:54,519
Okay, and the other one, now the Dostoevsky one.

535
00:50:54,520 --> 00:51:01,959
How about the unconditional commitment to all other human beings as the only lively, joyful way of life?

536
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,879
Aha, look at this.

537
00:51:03,879 --> 00:51:05,359
Dostoevsky is doing.

538
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:05,879
Very well.

539
00:51:05,879 --> 00:51:08,520
Come on, it'll take it, take a lot of counting.

540
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,080
Whoa.

541
00:51:09,719 --> 00:51:11,719
Stabilize your hands.

542
00:51:11,719 --> 00:51:12,919
One, two, three, four.

543
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,679
I got fifty.

544
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,600
Okay, fifty.

545
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,400
Wow.

546
00:51:30,399 --> 00:51:31,359
This is interesting.

547
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:34,479
I think Nietzsche is losing to Dostoevsky.

548
00:51:36,640 --> 00:52:02,719
Okay, but then we don't want to leave out the fact there may be people in the real world, don't let this course intimidate you, who believe that the secular Enlightenment values of individualism, autonomy, lucidity, peace, freedom, social justice, and progress are still the only way to go and that they will work eventually and there's what we should be working for.

549
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,160
How many believe that?

550
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,039
This is terrible.

551
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,360
I don't know what to think of that.

552
00:52:16,879 --> 00:52:18,719
This is not how it was.

553
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,719
Yes, oh, you're going to a few people will dare to support the Enlightenment.

554
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:23,199
Why don't you?

555
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:27,199
What's fixed okay?

556
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,479
Do it again.

557
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,480
Question in the middle.

558
00:52:30,799 --> 00:52:31,760
Question?

559
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,759
What do the GSIs and me think?

560
00:52:35,759 --> 00:52:36,800
That's interesting.

561
00:52:36,799 --> 00:52:37,519
I don't know.

562
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,519
Let's finish this and then we'll vote.

563
00:52:39,759 --> 00:52:42,640
We never have before, but we will.

564
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,280
Okay.

565
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,160
We got six for them.

566
00:52:47,279 --> 00:52:47,920
What?

567
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:48,959
Five.

568
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,800
That's what one of them was a question.

569
00:52:50,799 --> 00:52:51,519
Okay.

570
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,359
But we haven't, oddly enough, got to Nietzsche yet.

571
00:52:55,359 --> 00:53:11,959
Or is constant overcoming, danger, struggle, wonder, unstable selves, having different identities, a life that's a lot of short stories instead of a novel, or even bigger things like opening new worlds is what makes life worth living.

572
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,080
Those are the Nietzscheans.

573
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,520
How many Nietzscheans?

574
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,799
Ah, now I see.

575
00:53:15,799 --> 00:53:18,839
I mean, that's what I expected, but I was worrying about it.

576
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:20,040
That Nietzsche wasn't winning.

577
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:23,160
So I think Nietzsche is winning the taste game.

578
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,120
One, two, three, four, five.

579
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:42,120
He got 50.

580
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,959
What did you guys get?

581
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,560
What?

582
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,120
60.

583
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:48,839
Ah.

584
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,679
Well, I'll believe Ian.

585
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,640
I'm not very good at counting any more than I am at writing on the blackboard.

586
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,080
So, okay, 60.

587
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,480
Well, now what does that show?

588
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:14,360
I guess that shows that Nietzsche, see, that's what I suspected, that Nietzsche, once he turns the game into not a question of what's right or wrong, but what's happening in the world, and that's all that really matters, according to him.

589
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:16,760
What's that?

590
00:54:18,279 --> 00:54:21,400
Well, we don't know where I am yet, you mean?

591
00:54:22,279 --> 00:54:25,479
Well, I ended with Nietzsche because that's how the course ended.

592
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,199
No, I don't.

593
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:31,319
I'm not a Nietzschean one.

594
00:54:31,319 --> 00:54:33,080
I guess I'm Kierkegaardian.

595
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:36,840
I'm still way back in the unconditional commitment business.

596
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,600
I mean, maybe I could convert some of you.

597
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:45,320
As one of my TAs said last year, at the point when I was getting all these dossiers, all the Nietzsche votes, there were a lot of Nietzsche votes.

598
00:54:45,879 --> 00:54:49,679
She said, Would you want your lover to be a Nietzschean or a Kierkegaardian?

599
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,679
And that changed the votes completely.

600
00:54:57,199 --> 00:54:59,280
So I don't know what to do about that.

601
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:03,679
It shows that you've got to be careful when you take polls how you ask the question.

602
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,879
So, do the TAs want to tell where they're at in this?

603
00:55:06,879 --> 00:55:07,999
If so, please do.

604
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,400
The students would like to know.

605
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,080
Ian?

606
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,920
But you could say you don't you, you know, you haven't got a stand yet.

607
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,480
That's true, too, possibly.

608
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:31,920
I would say that I am and more in the Nietzsche, but for all those.

609
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:43,840
Those are the two biggest camps, that's Christine.

610
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,080
Oh, I just ask you something very well.

611
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,640
Steve, what?

612
00:55:50,239 --> 00:55:51,679
More Kierkegaard than Nietzsche.

613
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:52,560
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

614
00:55:52,879 --> 00:55:55,120
What do you mean, more Kierkegaard than Nietzsche?

615
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,759
Not Nietzsche.

616
00:55:59,759 --> 00:56:00,319
Okay.

617
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:01,360
Yeah.

618
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,480
I might have to see what it's going.

619
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:12,560
And can you hear him?

620
00:56:12,879 --> 00:56:13,439
He's.

621
00:56:17,279 --> 00:56:18,160
Okay.

622
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,920
Sonia.

623
00:56:21,279 --> 00:56:28,560
One thing that wants to change or finally come.

624
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:33,360
That's that's that's like you do the job of my TA last year.

625
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:34,160
Okay, yeah.

626
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:50,199
Oh, well, it's good to have somebody defending the Enlightenment.

627
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:58,280
Now, what I want to finally do, just got a minute, is I've got to look at this and see.

628
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:06,439
I mean, I'll tell you what happened last time, and then we'll see, I mean, because it's hard to compare since the number of people, but then I want to see if things are going.

629
00:57:07,239 --> 00:57:13,880
What's really important, if Nietzsche's right, is not the number, but the direction that things are going.

630
00:57:13,879 --> 00:57:19,560
Because his claim is, if he's right, it ought to become more Nietzschean every year.

631
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:25,879
And I do think that what's happened at least is that it's gone, in my experience, from Kierkegaard to Dostoevsky.

632
00:57:25,879 --> 00:57:31,960
And whether, and it did seem to me the last two times that it was getting more Nietzschean every year.

633
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:37,160
But let me just put the previous two times on the board, or one time, no, two times.

634
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,279
So what do we got?

635
00:57:38,279 --> 00:57:40,280
We've got tradition.

636
00:57:40,279 --> 00:57:42,679
Okay, it was 10 and 6.

637
00:57:42,679 --> 00:57:48,599
You see, you've got to now, I don't even know how to do this, but you've got to see these in relation to that.

638
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,960
Somebody helped me do this.

639
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:52,359
25 and then 7.

640
00:57:52,359 --> 00:57:56,120
I mean, this was, it went down from, it went down from 10 to 6.

641
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,639
This one really went down.

642
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,919
Kierkegaard's really going down from 25 to 7.

643
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:04,920
Romantic love is not a popular thing these days.

644
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:09,080
40 to 26.

645
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:13,160
So that went down pretty radically.

646
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,160
But it didn't here.

647
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,640
So Dostoevsky is staging a kind of comeback.

648
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:18,679
Let's see here.

649
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:26,480
This went, there was 4, and the next year 13.

650
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,960
So the Enlightenment was getting better.

651
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,639
And now the Nietzsche question.

652
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:34,960
Nietzsche was 40 and then 43.

653
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,160
Now, does that mean somebody helped me understand?

654
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:42,400
Yes, I think there's still a trend toward Nietzsche.

655
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:50,800
Just as he said, he will turn out to be right when everybody's going to have taste like his, and it may take 300 years.

656
00:58:51,759 --> 00:58:54,240
Is there anything else we can conclude from that?

657
00:58:54,239 --> 00:59:01,999
Dostoevsky is, this is the interesting one, that Dostoevsky is also, it's Dostoevsky versus Nietzsche.

658
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:08,160
If trend counts, it looks like taste is going in the direction for Dostoevsky.

659
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:15,679
Taste is going very much in his direction, even more than taste is going in Nietzsche's direction.

660
00:59:15,679 --> 00:59:19,839
That is, what is it, the derivative of the curve or something?

661
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:20,239
I don't know.

662
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:24,959
At MIT, they would tell me what it is.

663
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:37,600
What's happening here, that the acceleration of this is going for Dostoevsky, that the velocity is going for Nietzsche.

664
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:39,360
I'm not sure how to say this.

665
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:41,280
I have to think about this.

666
00:59:41,279 --> 00:59:48,800
But in any case, I think now I have to quickly do one more thing because people want to know what existential philosophy is.

667
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:51,280
I don't think that's a very interesting question, really.

668
00:59:51,279 --> 00:59:55,520
I mean, what's interesting, what is interesting is the views that these people have.

669
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,800
But I'll try to give you some general characteristics.

670
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:05,959
First, if you want to find definitions, start by looking at paradigm cases, which is exactly what we've done.

671
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:11,480
Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, and Nietzsche are really paradigm cases of existentialists.

672
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:20,199
It would be right to go also and look at Sartre and Heidegger and Pascal, whom I mention every once in a while.

673
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:28,840
Those six are the top guys: Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Sartre, Heidegger, and way back at the beginning, Pascal.

674
01:00:28,839 --> 01:00:34,840
And here's what I think they all have in common: one, there's no new, no human nature.

675
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:38,920
Pascal already said it when he said custom is our nature.

676
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:51,000
And Nietzsche says, so from the beginning, when Pascal says custom is our nature to the end, when Nietzsche says we're the undetermined animals, we have no fixed horizons.

677
01:00:51,319 --> 01:00:58,120
And therefore, they all think human nature and the world can radically change, be transformed.

678
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:05,080
History is more important than having any fixed eternity outside of time.

679
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:10,840
That's the big deal Judeo-Christian move against the Greeks.

680
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:19,560
And then, of course, if you use the old categories I used, in ethics, the individual is higher than the universal.

681
01:01:20,359 --> 01:01:32,199
And in epistemology, the involved point of view reveals reality and is more basic than what you get from detached reason and theory.

682
01:01:32,839 --> 01:01:36,199
And Kierkegaard terms truth to subjectivity.

683
01:01:36,839 --> 01:01:58,160
And finally, they all believe, and this is the metaphysical part, belief in an onto-theological God, that is a supreme being, is no longer plausible and no longer necessary, but they think, but it opens up the possibility of other ways of understanding the divine and the sacred.

684
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:05,600
They've all got their versions of the divine and the sacred, even Nietzsche with his polytheist claims.

685
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:11,280
So that's all I see that they all have in common, but that's a lot.

686
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:15,439
Did that go so fast that you didn't get it finally?

687
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,719
So I suppose it will show up on a podcast anyway.

688
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:26,800
And as I say, what's more important is to understand each of these people than it is to have what they have in common.

689
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:27,839
Okay, that's it.

690
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:32,719
I have to stop and we're going to hand out the forms, the evaluations.

691
01:02:53,199 --> 01:02:55,120
That's a new vote, I must say that.

692
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:56,879
It's a pretty neat one.

693
01:02:56,879 --> 01:02:58,080
Thank you.

694
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:58,879
Okay, quick.

695
01:02:58,879 --> 01:03:00,319
Give out the evaluations.

696
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:01,039
Yeah.

697
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:03,999
What's that?

698
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,279
What's my unconditional commitment?

699
01:03:07,279 --> 01:03:09,280
Teaching, I think.

700
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,560
So everything fits in, everything falls into place.

701
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,080
Here's another thing that somebody might ask.

702
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:33,760
If you like this course so much, you might, and if you have room in your schedule, you might be interested that I'm going to give Philosophy VI, which is sort of really the prequel to this, on next spring.

703
01:03:33,879 --> 01:03:47,080
And that goes follows the culture from Homer and Aeschylus with Virgil and Dante to Moby Dick, Moby Dick being exactly contemporaneous with Kierkegaard.

704
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:54,920
So if you want to know where where how it got to where you started this time, then you should look into Philosophy VI.
