1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,560
The idea is that once you've got an absolute source of meaning in your life, an unconditional commitment, then that has authority for you.

2
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,679
And you feel you've got to do whatever that relation requires.

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:25,079
That should be obvious, but I try to bring in examples as best I can.

4
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,560
The best example I know is the Shakespeare play, Much A Do About Nothing.

5
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,400
How many of you know that play?

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,919
Very oh, good, good.

7
00:00:32,919 --> 00:00:45,959
Well, it doesn't worry about this issue the way Kierkegaard does, that Benedict loves Beatrice, not Dante's Beatrice, but another Beatrice, and she demands that he kill Claudio.

8
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,720
So he's upset about it because he doesn't want to be a murderer.

9
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:59,319
But if the most important person in his life, what gives his life meaning and gives him his identity, requires it, then he better do it.

10
00:00:59,319 --> 00:01:08,999
So the ethical side, namely you shouldn't go around killing people, is in conflict with the unconditional commitment side.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,560
Now, that's clear.

12
00:01:11,559 --> 00:01:18,439
In Kierkegaard's life, there's also something related, something murky that I don't want to stink into the gossip of.

13
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:23,560
But he's done two things at once when he broke with Regina.

14
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:30,679
He saw that the defining commitment was, for some reason we're not very clear about, impossible.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,919
And he went against the ethical because he broke his engagement in 1850 Copenhagen.

16
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:38,599
That's a big deal.

17
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:54,959
So the first thing he deals with in the what we've been reading of the preliminary, the, what is it, the something from the heart, the preamble from the heart, thanks, is the part about now I don't have any girlfriend anymore.

18
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,840
I just lost my defining commitment person.

19
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:17,039
And the next thing, problems one and two, are about, yeah, but how could anybody ever go against the ethical and do something wrong and somehow feel at the same time that was just exactly the right thing to do, which is how he feels about it.

20
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:29,840
And the third problem, which we don't read at all, is about keeping secrets and whether he was sort of manipulating his relation with Regina and what kind of secrets is okay to keep and whatnot.

21
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,960
And we're not going to read that.

22
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,039
You can read it on your own.

23
00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:35,039
So here we go.

24
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:37,520
Well, let me see now where I am.

25
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:58,560
Okay, the crucial move now is that Isaac goes from being the representing the object of a defining commitment in the preamble from the heart, totally switches around and represents the ethical.

26
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,359
But that's why I told you about Regina.

27
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:04,960
When he breaks with Regina, he does two separate things.

28
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:14,239
Regina stands for the defining commitment, but breaking with her, breaking his engagement, is breaking the ethical.

29
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:23,280
So it's natural that what he's going to talk about are two different phenomena, that they're all tied up together.

30
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,959
But it means that Isaac is looked at under two different descriptions.

31
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:36,039
Isaac is, we've seen already, the object of his defining, of Abraham's defining commitment.

32
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:38,919
On 54 is where this gets talked about.

33
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:44,039
I haven't mentioned it, but I, oh, I did mention it in passing, but I never read it.

34
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,720
Maybe that's because, is it within your reading?

35
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:59,400
No, that's why I haven't ever read it, but I'll read it because that's the nearest to a statement that Isaac represents for Abraham his defining commitment, namely what his identity is.

36
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:12,919
And that it says about 15 lines down: Abraham believed, he believed he would become old in his land, honored among his people, blessed in his kin, eternally remembered in Isaac, the dearest in his life.

37
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:26,039
I take that to mean Abraham thinks of himself as the father of the faith by way of Isaac, and therefore Isaac is somehow tied up in his understanding of who he is.

38
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:28,199
I don't think that's very important.

39
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:35,319
It's just important to realize that Isaac has switched around by page 88.

40
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,999
When you get to problem one, it's totally switched.

41
00:04:38,999 --> 00:04:45,240
I don't know how anybody ever understands this book because so many weird things are happening.

42
00:04:45,239 --> 00:04:49,320
It took me years to unscramble it and lots of help from students.

43
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,119
I'm still ready to be helped anytime.

44
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:54,439
It's never completely unscrambled.

45
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:01,079
On page 88, we read at the end of the middle paragraph.

46
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,919
Insofar as the universal was there, we'll get back to the universal.

47
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:06,200
That's the ethical.

48
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:09,720
The ethical gives you universal principles.

49
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:12,999
Well, that needs some explaining, but for the moment.

50
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:19,439
Insofar as the universal was there at all, it was latent in Isaac, concealed as it were in his loins.

51
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:25,359
All that means is, and it would cry out with Isaac's mouth, don't do it, you're destroying everything.

52
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:30,640
Meaning, well, don't do it because you're going against the ethical, is what it means now.

53
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:41,520
And so now we have to understand what the ethical is, and we have to understand a new paradox and a new anguish.

54
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,799
Everything gets another meaning.

55
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:54,319
Not that it contradicts the old meaning, it's just a whole different perspective on the whole, the Abraham, Isaac, or the Kierkegaard-Regina story.

56
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,679
Okay, so now we're going to go back to 83.

57
00:05:57,679 --> 00:05:59,840
It needs lots of explaining.

58
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:10,720
He jumps right in, assuming that you have been reading Kant and Hegel, I think, and like the people in Denmark in those days.

59
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,760
And I need to explain it to you enough so that you can understand without having to read any kind of Hegel, which is a big help.

60
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:19,919
So, okay, here we go.

61
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,039
I'm going to just start reading it and explaining it because it throws a huge amount at you right off.

62
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,679
The ethical, as such, is the universal.

63
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:34,559
And as the universal, it applies to everyone, which can be put from another point of view by saying that it applies at every moment.

64
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:43,040
That means if there's something that's right, then it's right for everybody all the time, if it's really the thing to do.

65
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,480
Or, more likely, it's going to be a wrong thing to do, like don't lie.

66
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:54,160
And if that turns out to be the right advice, then it means nobody anywhere, anytime, ought to lie.

67
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,000
And that's a universal principle.

68
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:04,599
And Kant thought there were such universal principles, and he thought that they were ethical, universal principles.

69
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:07,399
They had authority because they were rational.

70
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,999
He won't bother to explain that.

71
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,840
That they had authority over all human beings because human beings were rational.

72
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,440
So let's go on.

73
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:27,960
And it rests imminently in itself with nothing outside itself that is its telos, but is itself the telos for everything outside.

74
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,480
And when that is taken up into it, it has no further to go.

75
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:34,280
That means it's the highest thing.

76
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:38,119
If I tell you a principle, let's make it positive.

77
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:40,200
Always tell the truth.

78
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,120
There's no higher reason to do that.

79
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:50,120
I didn't say tell the truth because if you don't, people will find out and won't like you.

80
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:54,280
Or always tell the truth because it's good for business in the long run.

81
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:57,160
Or if you do, you'll feel better about yourself.

82
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,519
Those would all be reasons for telling the truth.

83
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:04,760
But there isn't any reason for telling the truth except that that's the right thing to do.

84
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:16,840
And that's the sense in which telos, meaning and our final reason, the final reason is just the ethical principle itself.

85
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,720
Kant talks about it being a categorical imperative.

86
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,360
You don't have to worry about those big terms.

87
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,399
And he says it's not a hypothetical imperative.

88
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,640
That's helpful in that jargon.

89
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,080
You only, again, don't worry about it.

90
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,760
Don't need to write it down.

91
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:35,960
But the hypothetical imperative says this thing I've been saying.

92
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,480
If you want to be liked, always tell the truth.

93
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,560
Or if you want to be believed, always tell the truth.

94
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:44,520
That is, if something, then the ethical.

95
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:46,599
But the ethical isn't a hypothetical.

96
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:48,920
If you want to be something, do something.

97
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,560
It just says do it.

98
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,879
That's a categorical imperative.

99
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,480
That's where we are so far.

100
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,320
Seen as immediate, let's see where we are.

101
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:07,200
No more than sensated psychic being, the single individual is the particular that has its telos in the universal.

102
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:15,840
And the individual's ethical task is always to express himself in this, abrogate his particularity so as to become the universal.

103
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:19,359
That's a mouthful, but it's not so hard to understand.

104
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:30,960
That is, remember way back when I said what the Greeks thought about ethics, and it was that the ethical principles apply to everybody all the time.

105
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:38,160
And now we're adding a new thing, insofar as you do the right thing, you do what anybody would do.

106
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,599
You subsume yourself into the universal.

107
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:46,480
That is, the highest thing for you to do is what everybody would do.

108
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:50,320
And you want to not be a particular.

109
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,080
That's lower immediacy.

110
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,240
You want to become the universal.

111
00:09:54,239 --> 00:10:04,239
That is, you want to do the ethical thing which anybody at any time in that situation would do.

112
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,160
That's being ethical.

113
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,680
If you don't do that, then you just do your own thing.

114
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:18,880
And you could state the whole, another way to state the ethical principles are: don't make an exception of yourself.

115
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:27,200
You can't say, well, this is a pretty tough situation, and for most people, most of the time, they shouldn't lie, but there, boy, this would help a lot if I lied right now.

116
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,080
And that's not ethical.

117
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,880
Or, how many of you have read Crime and Punishment, right?

118
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:34,479
How many have read Crime and Punishment?

119
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,920
Verskolnikov thinks that he doesn't have to worry about the ethical.

120
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,840
He's a superior being.

121
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:50,040
And as a superior human being, he just makes an exception of himself, and he does what he wants to do, and he needs money, so he wants to kill the pawnbroker.

122
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,520
Well, that's exactly the unethical.

123
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:56,119
That's thinning.

124
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,720
And I had you, you've got how many bring along this paper that I gave out.

125
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,679
Probably not very many.

126
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,040
So I can, how many?

127
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:04,999
Lots.

128
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:05,320
Good.

129
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,200
Well, look at it, and I'll draw a sketch of it on the board, but it's better if you look at it.

130
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:14,680
We're now in the middle picture.

131
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,320
And the ethical I'm going to write here is the universal.

132
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:29,320
And if you're here doing something, there are two ways to deviate from the universal.

133
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:32,040
And I'm talking about only one of them right now.

134
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,960
And you become a, you do your particular, your own thing.

135
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:42,280
You act like an individual, like a particular, and that is all, that is temptation.

136
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:49,960
That is, he calls it also sin.

137
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,520
That's the picture you have of doing something wrong.

138
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:59,640
And if you do that, then you're guilty, and you have to do something to repent.

139
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:10,760
And if you're guilty, you repent, you pay your price to society or whatever, and then so that you can get back to the universal.

140
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:13,800
We'll talk more about that in a minute.

141
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,240
So, let me see if I've read the first basic things I need to read.

142
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,080
Yeah.

143
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,480
And now I have to say something about the translation, which is very confusing.

144
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,440
In fact, every year I'm confused about it differently.

145
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,400
I think last time I taught it, I still had it wrong.

146
00:12:33,359 --> 00:12:42,080
What's puzzling is that there's only one Danish word which means both individual and means particular.

147
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:55,440
Remember, I said when I talked about Kierkegaard, he said he wanted to be an individual, and I said for that you need an unconditional commitment, but a particular, anybody's a particular, that just means one among many.

148
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:04,080
So you could put on your dog's tombstone, here lies a particular, but you couldn't put on your dog's tombstone, here lies an individual.

149
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:12,960
I use that weird example because Kierkegaard said, I don't think I said this, maybe I did, that he wanted carved on his tombstone, here lies an individual.

150
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:23,599
Well, individual here is being used not in that fancy special Kierkegaardian sense, but really as synonymous with the particular.

151
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:34,800
See, the trouble is with one Danish word, you could hear it either way, and presumably in Denmark, you could hear in context when Kierkegaard said he wanted it on his tombstone, here lies an individual.

152
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:40,400
He didn't mean by that word just any old particular.

153
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:52,560
But the translator tries to fix it by saying single individual, and that's supposed to mean the same as particular.

154
00:13:52,879 --> 00:14:08,359
And I would just put instead, whenever you see single individual, put person, something just to help you remember that this is not the fancy individual that Kierkegaard wants to talk about.

155
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,560
You could put particular.

156
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,639
I mean, it obviously that's going to get you in trouble later for reasons I can't explain.

157
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:18,760
Not deep reasons, just translation reasons.

158
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:26,760
But so, and the reason this is mixed up, this is what I understood this time for the first time in all these years.

159
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:29,960
I thought, why in the world doesn't he find another word?

160
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:39,080
Why does he say a word in Danish which has to be translated somehow and then it gets translated singular individual?

161
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,080
Isn't that confusing?

162
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:51,640
Well, it's not confusing if you remember, which I didn't, that this is being written from the point of view of the ethical, this paragraph.

163
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:59,640
And from the point of view of the ethical, there is only one opposite to the universal.

164
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:07,560
I mean, if it isn't universal, it's particular, or in our translation, single individual.

165
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:36,839
And that's because, that's very important in that's very important because he's going to go on and on about the fact that if you believe that the only alternatives that philosophy believes, Hegel believes, Kant believes, the only alternative to doing what is universal and what everybody does is doing your own thing.

166
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:49,720
And doing your own thing isn't, it doesn't make a distinction from the point of view of the ethical, whether you're doing your own thing by loving the princess or whether you're doing your own thing by killing the princess.

167
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,759
You're just doing your own thing and you're making an exception of yourself.

168
00:15:53,759 --> 00:16:04,239
So the idea that there could be a higher immediacy there, a super kind of exception, and Kierkegaard sometimes calls the higher immediacy person the exception.

169
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,759
The ethical doesn't have that.

170
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,759
And that's the point.

171
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:17,840
The philosophy doesn't have any notion of a difference between a particular and a super individual.

172
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,839
They're just all particulars.

173
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,999
And that's why this is hard to read.

174
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:32,160
But just don't associate it to anything special about the individual, and it'll be all right.

175
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,680
So I guess I'll go on reading it that way.

176
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,799
But I mean, I don't know whether it, now I don't know whether it's better to say person or single individual.

177
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:52,160
I thought once it was misleading to say single individual, but now I see that if you read this as speaking from the ethical, then it's not misleading.

178
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,200
It's the ethical that's misled, so to speak.

179
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,679
The ethical can't make a distinction.

180
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:14,320
So anyway, that is all something maybe that I shouldn't even tell you, except that you'll see in later passages, which we may or may not get to today, the particular, the individual gets all confused because it isn't written from the point of view of the ethical.

181
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,600
Never mind, for the moment.

182
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,799
You can understand it now if you just don't worry about that.

183
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,280
Notice that it gets to be the particular later in the same paragraph.

184
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,440
I read it.

185
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,079
The universal, wait, where is it?

186
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:33,840
Let's see how the single individual is the particular.

187
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,559
You see, he's not making a distinction that has its telos in the universal.

188
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,760
And the individuals, that's still a single individual, that's still just you or me.

189
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:51,159
Ethical task is always to express himself in this, to abrogate his particularity so as to become universal.

190
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,319
That's the clearest way to put it.

191
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:56,920
Then you just, that's what that whole paragraph is trying to say.

192
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:06,039
You've got to stop being here, making an exception of yourself, and do what any right-thinking person will do.

193
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,239
Is that okay?

194
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:10,200
I'm sorry to throw you into this because I don't know if it's worth it.

195
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:16,279
If I were translating it, I guess I would just say all the time, particular, and not mess people up.

196
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:19,879
But this is how this guy decided to do it.

197
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,960
Now, let's see.

198
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:36,920
Now, the question is: why it is, what's so important about the ethicals from the Kierkegaardian and, I think, Hegelian point of view?

199
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:46,200
I think maybe for Plato, the ethical is important for reasons that if you don't do the ethical, you won't be fulfilled and happy.

200
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,119
But that, from a Kantian point of view, you should be used to it now.

201
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,319
What would that be?

202
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:53,160
If you want to be happy, do the ethics.

203
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,519
What would that be?

204
00:18:54,519 --> 00:19:00,999
That would be, you know, that would be having a hypothetical imperative.

205
00:19:00,999 --> 00:19:02,920
If you want to be happy, do the ethical.

206
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,400
Kant doesn't like Plato and Aristotle.

207
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,200
He thinks that there's no reason that you could do the ethical except that it's the ethical.

208
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,479
It's the right thing to do.

209
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:13,720
Any reasonable being will do it.

210
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:22,559
But so, why, but is there any, if it isn't in Plato, where will you find the advantage of being ethical?

211
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:28,720
Well, Hegel has a story about it, which is very interesting and crucial to this whole discussion.

212
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,119
And that's on 103.

213
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,759
And I'll just say it in my language and then I'll read it.

214
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:43,519
The ethical is what makes you intelligible to yourself and everybody else.

215
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:47,440
Meaning, you can explain and justify what you're doing.

216
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:55,359
You can say, I'm telling the truth to this person, even though it's going to hurt them a lot, because it wouldn't be right to lie to them.

217
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:06,239
Or you can say, I'm giving back all this money I just found on the street because it is mine and it belongs to somebody else and you've got to respect people's property.

218
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:08,479
You can explain what you're doing.

219
00:20:08,479 --> 00:20:11,759
You can also explain when you're doing something wrong and you know it's wrong.

220
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,479
And you can say, I'm doing this because I just can't help it, but I know I shouldn't, and so forth.

221
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:24,400
But you can, to yourself and to everybody else, make sense of what you're doing by way of the ethical.

222
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,880
I'll explain it more in a minute, but first I'll just read it.

223
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,119
The middle of 103.

224
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:37,440
David Knight knows that it is glorious to belong to the universal.

225
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,640
Never mind who knows it.

226
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,879
It's glorious to belong to the universal.

227
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:48,720
He knows it is beautiful and benign to be the particular, this is okay, who translates himself into the universal.

228
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:56,080
The one who, so to speak, he makes a clear and elegant edition of himself, as immaculate as possible, and readable for all.

229
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:57,599
That's his intelligence.

230
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:11,879
He knows it is refreshing to become intelligible to oneself in the universal, so that he understands the universal, and everyone who understands him understands the universal through him in turn, and both rejoice in the security of the universal.

231
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:34,039
That's all a poetic-ish way to say that it's a good thing there's a shared public moral vocabulary that tells us what's good and bad and right and wrong, and in a nice way of putting it that another philosopher has, what's worthy and not worthy.

232
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:36,920
We have a whole way of talking about that.

233
00:21:37,239 --> 00:22:01,479
And now it's important too to see that once you put it that way, you don't have to believe in the universal like in Kant, namely that there is some right way to behave, and that everybody everywhere, insofar as they're a rational being like us, recognizes it.

234
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:02,760
We don't believe that anymore.

235
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:07,639
We know there are all these different cultures who have very different understandings of what's good and what's bad.

236
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:14,279
Some think property is very important, some think property doesn't matter at all, and so forth.

237
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,999
And Hegel already knew that.

238
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:32,440
And one of his changes over time was to say, what's important is that you have a shared vocabulary about what's worthy and unworthy shared with your peers.

239
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,559
It doesn't have to be universal.

240
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:51,519
Even if you're a macho motorcycle biker, then you have your vocabulary of who's tough and who's not, who's strong and who's feminine and a sissy and weak, who, and so forth.

241
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:55,120
And you can explain what you're doing to the other people in the group.

242
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,239
If you're sort of beating up on somebody, they'll all understand that that's a good thing to do.

243
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:06,960
And if you are not beating up on somebody when you could, you'll have to make excuses and so forth.

244
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:17,440
You just want to get a feeling that you will be intelligible to yourself and them as long as you use their vocabulary of who's tough and who's weak.

245
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,639
And that's what you gain in the ethical.

246
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:33,999
It isn't necessary to do, to put it in other jargon, it isn't necessary to have an answer to what's right and what's wrong, as long as you understand in your group what's good and what's bad.

247
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:36,559
That's just the way the philosophers use these words.

248
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,479
There's nothing really magical about it.

249
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:43,359
But the good and bad changes from culture to culture and group to group.

250
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:51,599
And that's enough to give you the value of the ethical, making you intelligible.

251
00:23:51,600 --> 00:24:00,639
You don't have to believe in right and wrong, that there's one answer to the which of all the many goods and many cultures is the right one.

252
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,400
Okay, now it's way Kierkegaard sets this up.

253
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:17,279
I told you all that because problem one discusses it as if you were believing Kant and as if there was one universal which applied to everybody everywhere.

254
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:29,039
But problem two discusses it in a different language and talks about the question of whether you're in lower immediacy or higher immediacy.

255
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:38,519
That is, whether you're doing something that is intelligible to other people or whether you're just making an exception of yourself.

256
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,639
We'll get to those.

257
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:43,559
But the main thing is now to see where we are.

258
00:24:48,759 --> 00:25:09,399
Hegel jargon, I think that problem one is about the universal, and problem two is about the concrete universe, which is how there is something universal in your particular culture and your particular vocabulary, and it's only universal relative to your culture and your vocabulary.

259
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:17,559
It's the universal made concrete, made specific as it's specific in your world.

260
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,239
Any problems about this?

261
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:27,799
I mean, we just thought to get all these philosophical things in place before we can get back to particular Kierkegaardian puzzles.

262
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:37,640
Okay, so now then, and I have written down here, every culture has its distinctions of worthiness and how different they are.

263
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:53,960
I jumped into these bikers, but to say something more relevant to the course, that the Greeks that we talked about will have their values, their moral vocabulary, and they will distinguish between heroes and slaves.

264
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,080
And that's a very different distinction.

265
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:04,759
I think I may have mentioned this before than what the medieval Christians will hang up, which is a distinction between saints and sinners.

266
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:08,200
They're very did I talk about this at all?

267
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,080
I don't think so.

268
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:19,720
Okay, well, it's worth noticing that the different stages in our culture has have had different senses of the the ethical and the universal and different moral vocabularies.

269
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:29,840
If you try to think of the medievals in terms of hero and slave, you get very messed up because a saint is more like a slave, at least from the Greek point of view.

270
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:32,159
A saint lets everybody walk all over them.

271
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,999
If the saint hits them, if somebody hits the saint on one cheek, they don't slap back.

272
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:39,999
They let them hit them on the other.

273
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:43,519
They are non-violent and so forth.

274
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:49,119
That's a very pathetic way to be from Homeric point of view.

275
00:26:49,120 --> 00:27:01,519
And if you try to bring heroes in to the medievals, they turn out to be sinners because they don't have any humility or any sense that there's a higher authority, namely God.

276
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:10,399
They think they're the highest authority and they can protect themselves and everybody else and everybody should look up to them and sing songs about them, as in Homer.

277
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,519
And they turn out to be in hell in Dante.

278
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:15,279
The few heroes would see.

279
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,200
They don't get to paradise.

280
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,479
And then it gets interesting, and I'll give you just two more because they turn out to be relevant.

281
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:31,999
When you get to the modern, obviously, after Kant, maybe it isn't obvious, but we'll hear it again, but it feels sort of obvious to us.

282
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:34,400
So I think we might not be in it anymore.

283
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:44,559
It's a time that's from Kant up to recently, the big distinctions between the, so to speak, good and bad was between being mature and immature.

284
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:54,319
For Kant, the great thing about rational human beings is they were mature in the sense that they took responsibility for what they did.

285
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:56,479
They understood that it was rational.

286
00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:58,079
They could justify it.

287
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:00,159
They could justify their actions.

288
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,400
And as he puts it, it was immature.

289
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:07,799
It was childish to believe that it was the Pope or the Prince that told you what to do.

290
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:10,839
Nobody tells you what to do, but your own rationality.

291
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,920
You have to be autonomous.

292
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,440
That's maturity.

293
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,119
And that's what, according to Kant, was discovered in the Enlightenment.

294
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,239
And that's all neat.

295
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,519
I'm not sure we have that distinction so important for us anymore.

296
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:38,039
But what we're going to discuss later, I think one of our important distinctions is whether you're healthy or sick, whether you're natural or perverted, something like that might be our distinction.

297
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:42,599
And then other cultures would even have other ones.

298
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:50,839
Okay, so we've got these moral distinctions relative to the group and making you intelligible to your peer group.

299
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:58,599
All you have to do to be intelligible is do what's good according to your community.

300
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:14,999
So on 97, well, I read it, I gestured at it, but I better read the beginning of that paragraph.

301
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:20,999
In the ethical view of life, now we're into the Hegel, where it's not absolute anymore.

302
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:25,559
In the ethical view of life, then it is the individuals.

303
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:30,759
I would say particulars, but if you remember, this is not going to be the fancy kind of individual.

304
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:32,840
I'd still write in particular if I were you.

305
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:34,360
It's the same Danish word.

306
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,319
It's easier.

307
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:42,600
In the ethical view of life, then, it's the particular's task to divest himself of the determinants of interiority.

308
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:47,639
That's the inner, the private stuff, and give it an expression in the exterior.

309
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,720
That's the making it intelligible.

310
00:29:49,920 --> 00:30:02,399
Whenever the particular shrinks from doing so, whenever he wants to stay inside or slip back into the inner determinants of feeling, mood, etc., he commits an offense, he is in a state of temptation.

311
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:17,680
So, to be in a state of temptation, you are going in some way to not be intelligible, to make an exception of yourself, to do what you feel like doing in your mood, with your desires, and whatever.

312
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,440
And that I think that's all we need.

313
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:25,839
Yes, don't read further, that will blow your mind too soon.

314
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:37,680
Okay, so Kierkegaard wants to keep, remember now, Kierkegaard wants to keep the achievements of Greek philosophy in such a way as to have the best of both worlds.

315
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:40,879
That's what makes him interesting.

316
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,599
But he's running into something that looks like a big problem.

317
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:58,559
And namely, there's something in the Judeo-Christian tradition, starting with Abraham, which the Greek tradition has no understanding of.

318
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:03,200
Namely, that people can have defining commitments that make them an individual.

319
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:10,639
Let's write it with a capital I, the kind of individual Kierkegaard wants to be and wants everybody to be.

320
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:17,839
And then that has, we're back to this thing I started with, a higher authority in your life than the ethical.

321
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:23,279
And that's, in a way, says you are making an exception of yourself.

322
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:28,399
You are, that is, you are an exception, and that's just the opposite of ethical.

323
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:34,479
That's the sense in which, for the Judeo-Christians, the individual is higher than the universal.

324
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,359
Remember, I put that slogan on the board, the first lecture.

325
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,680
Now you see what it means.

326
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:45,479
Once you've got a defining commitment, it trumps the ethical.

327
00:31:45,479 --> 00:31:56,519
It tells you that what you're supposed to do, and it may not be at all what everybody's supposed to do, just to keep you reminding of what's in the background, Abraham's going to kill Isaac.

328
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:00,039
That's what Abraham has to do for some obscure reason.

329
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,839
And Kierkegaard never explains.

330
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:07,160
And then Kierkegaard has to break his engagement with Regina for some obscure reason.

331
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:15,160
But these obscure reasons are their calling, are their vocation, are the most individual thing about them.

332
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,599
And that means they have to go against the ethical, which says don't kill anybody.

333
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,520
That's not the way to do it.

334
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,400
Don't break your engagements, and so forth.

335
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:37,880
So what the Judeo-Christian thinks is highest is already sin for the Greeks.

336
00:32:37,879 --> 00:32:41,880
And now the question is: how is Kierkegaard going to get these two together?

337
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:45,079
I mean, it's these big, conflicted worlds.

338
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:57,959
Well, in a certain way, you can't get them together, but you could put them in some kind of relationship that will save the ethical, even from being totally irrelevant.

339
00:32:57,959 --> 00:32:59,800
I'll explain it right now.

340
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,039
Well, no, first I better just read you another at the bottom of 97.

341
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,599
Again, now, now, boy, this is mixed up.

342
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,040
I thought I had figured it out, but the translation is hopeless.

343
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,039
My idea, oh, nuts.

344
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:35,120
My idea that single individual was a way of talking about the particular from the point of view of the ethical doesn't work because at the bottom of 97, he's talking from the point of view of faith.

345
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,599
He says this is face paradox.

346
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:42,880
Face paradox is this, that the single individual is higher than the universal.

347
00:33:42,879 --> 00:33:44,720
You've got to cross out single there.

348
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,039
That is the capital I individual is higher than the universal.

349
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,480
It is a mess.

350
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,439
This moral is the translator doesn't understand it, and there's only one Danish word.

351
00:33:55,439 --> 00:33:58,399
And somehow Kierkegaard thought it was obvious.

352
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,320
And I don't know whether every reader in Denmark thought it was obvious or not.

353
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:03,839
So anyway, we're going to read it now.

354
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:09,520
Then face paradox is this, that the individual, capital I, is higher than the universal.

355
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:19,920
That the individual, never mind in parentheses, that the individual determines his relation to the universal through his relation to the absolute.

356
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:26,960
That always means his or her vocation, what is unconditional in their life.

357
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,680
Not his relation to the absolute through his relation to the universal.

358
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,879
That would be Plato, that the good is the absolute.

359
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:45,120
The more universal you are, the closer you are to doing what every human being ought to do to make them happy.

360
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,040
That would be getting in the right relation to the universal.

361
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,160
The paradox can also be put by saying that there is an absolute duty to God.

362
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,079
Always write whenever you see God.

363
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:06,759
It's very confusing because we never are told who God is or what God is or anything else because Kierkegaard isn't really thinking of God in the normal way.

364
00:35:06,759 --> 00:35:12,120
Whenever you see God, you should write in something like your calling, your vocation.

365
00:35:12,439 --> 00:35:16,200
There's a calling, but it isn't really from anybody.

366
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,840
It isn't as if God is actually calling.

367
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:26,519
What's important is that there is something that has authority in your life that is absolute for you.

368
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:36,440
That's the princess, or that's your, like Martin Luther King, your commitment to something.

369
00:35:36,439 --> 00:35:42,120
So there is something then, and you have an absolute duty to do what that calling is.

370
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:51,960
For in this entire obligation, the individual with a capital I relates himself absolutely as the single individual, no, as the individual with a capital I.

371
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:53,880
I just keep rewriting here.

372
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:05,000
To the absolute, that is, to whatever is calling him to do whatever he has to do.

373
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:09,160
When people now say that it's duty to the, no, never mind that.

374
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:16,119
Well, no, it won't help to read anymore for the moment.

375
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:27,480
So we just read that.

376
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:29,800
Well, I'll skip just a tiny bit.

377
00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:38,200
If this duty, that is to do your individual thing, is absolute, your calling, the ethical is going to be reduced to the relative.

378
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,239
That's right.

379
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,680
Because what does that mean?

380
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:44,040
That means in general it's a good thing to obey the ethical.

381
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:52,560
But if there's a conflict between the ethical and your commitment, your commitment has higher authority.

382
00:36:52,560 --> 00:37:11,120
We're back to Benedict and Beatrice, and Beatrice telling Benedict, tell Claudio, Beatrice trumps the ethical, and that makes it relative, and she has absolute authority.

383
00:37:11,759 --> 00:37:14,320
So, okay.

384
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:23,279
But now it gets really complicated, but not hopelessly so.

385
00:37:23,279 --> 00:37:26,160
And I mean, really clear, if you just get it.

386
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:45,440
For philosophy and Hegel, if faith, which is always like night of faith, requires a defining unconditional commitment, then it and requires going against the authority of the universal.

387
00:37:45,759 --> 00:37:49,040
What can philosophers say about faith?

388
00:37:49,040 --> 00:38:02,239
Well, from a philosophy point, faith has got to be making an exception of yourself so that they can't tell the difference, these philosophers, between faith and sinning.

389
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:19,520
I mean, faith is, if you are if you're a Judeo-Christian, faith can be going up here to your commitment, your calling.

390
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:32,319
But if you don't have any up here, and this is higher immediacy, if the only immediacy you know is down here as philosophers, then you can't tell faith from sinning.

391
00:38:32,319 --> 00:38:42,039
That's his big thing that he's going to, you know, sort of destroy the usual understanding of everything by the Abraham story.

392
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:53,320
And he's going to sort of overthrow Hegel, who thinks he's somehow got the truth of Christianity in his philosophy, and say, no, no, Hegel is just a philosopher.

393
00:38:53,319 --> 00:39:03,480
No philosopher has the categories, the distinctions to make sense of faith, because faith goes against the ethical.

394
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:13,640
And whether you mean by the ethical the right, the universal, or whether you mean the ethical being the good in your culture, faith goes against both of them.

395
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:25,799
Because faith can require Abraham to murder Isaac and Benedict to murder Claudio and Kierkegaard to break his engagement with Rudina.

396
00:39:25,799 --> 00:39:28,920
And this is what he now is going to talk about.

397
00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:31,000
97.

398
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,480
He's talking about it.

399
00:39:34,759 --> 00:40:00,279
And if you, if I'm going to go on reading now, the paradox of faith, I'm about six lines into the paragraph on 97, is this, that there is an interiority, that's again like the lower immediacy, that's your moods and stuff, that is incommensurable with the exterior, that is, can't be put in exterior means putting it out in words so that everybody can understand it.

400
00:40:00,279 --> 00:40:10,520
And this interiority, it sometimes means my moods, my obsessions, my fantasies, and so forth, which I can't put out so you can understand them.

401
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:17,640
But it also could mean my unconditional commitment, which I also can't put out into words so that you can understand it.

402
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:26,159
So there's an interiority incommensurable with the exterior, an interiority, which it should be stressed, is not identical with the first.

403
00:40:26,399 --> 00:40:28,080
That's lower immediacy.

404
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,919
But is a new interiority.

405
00:40:29,919 --> 00:40:32,000
That's higher immediate.

406
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:36,959
Now, then just skip a little.

407
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:44,480
Recent philosophy, that's Hegel, has allowed itself without further ado to substitute the immediate for faith.

408
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,399
That's exactly what Hegel's got.

409
00:40:46,399 --> 00:40:49,440
And he talks about faith as the immediate.

410
00:40:49,439 --> 00:40:55,440
If one does that, it is ridiculous to deny that faith has existed through all ages.

411
00:40:55,759 --> 00:40:57,519
Faith is such a case key.

412
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:03,520
Now, why would faith have existed through all ages if you identify faith with the immediate?

413
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,479
Because the immediate has existed through all ages.

414
00:41:06,879 --> 00:41:15,759
Everybody's got children, and children are all selfish and inarticulate, and have all kinds of moods and fantasies and desires.

415
00:41:15,759 --> 00:41:19,119
I mean, the lower immediacy is the most common thing in the world.

416
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:27,519
And if you go around and say the only place we've got to put faith is down here, well, here's lower immediacy.

417
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:40,239
Now, this is what Hegel, this is where Hegel puts faith.

418
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:51,759
Now, if you put faith there, then to use Kierkegaard jargon, faith has never existed because it's always existed.

419
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,759
I could find the page number for that, but I will come across it later anyway.

420
00:41:55,759 --> 00:42:00,160
What does it mean faith has never existed because it's always existed?

421
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,480
Well, if faith is the immediate, it's always existed.

422
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:09,319
But if faith is the immediate, then faith has never been anything special.

423
00:42:09,959 --> 00:42:18,839
So there's never been anything special called faith because there's always been plenty of people making exceptions of themselves and so forth.

424
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:20,519
If I read this, maybe it'll help.

425
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,120
You're looking dazed.

426
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,319
This must not be overlooked.

427
00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:28,680
Recent philosophy puts faith with the immediate.

428
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:33,640
If one does that, it's ridiculous to deny that faith has existed to all ages.

429
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,400
Faith in such a case keeps fairly ordinary company.

430
00:42:37,399 --> 00:42:41,559
It belongs with, and here's the neatest list of things in the immediate.

431
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,319
He doesn't tell you very often.

432
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:51,320
It belongs with feeling, mood, idiosyncrasy, hysteria, and the rest.

433
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:54,679
And now what does he think about that list of things?

434
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:58,840
Well, he thinks we could be a good idea to get rid of all that.

435
00:42:58,839 --> 00:43:04,520
So he says, so far philosophy is right to say that one should not stop at that.

436
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:09,879
That is, you shouldn't sort of wallow in your feelings, moods, and hysteria.

437
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:15,239
And I always put in fantasies, obsessions, what else?

438
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,879
Superstitions, and so forth.

439
00:43:19,879 --> 00:43:21,640
You shouldn't stop there.

440
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,759
But there is nothing to warrant philosophy speaking in this manner.

441
00:43:24,759 --> 00:43:28,279
Prior to faith, there is a movement.

442
00:43:28,279 --> 00:43:30,440
Oh, no, I stop with that.

443
00:43:30,439 --> 00:43:32,199
Because that's what I want to get at.

444
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:48,440
Remember, I said way back, maybe 15 minutes ago or something, that Kierkegaard wants to save some truth for philosophy while at the same time relativizing it and saying that it hasn't got the whole story.

445
00:43:48,439 --> 00:44:00,160
It hasn't even got the best story, but it's a good thing to have mediation, to get over all this stuff in lower immediacy.

446
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:12,000
And you couldn't even get to higher immediacy, where you have an unconditional commitment, if you didn't get rid of your fantasies and fanaticisms and so forth, because you couldn't tell the difference.

447
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:34,640
But so only after you've done reflective, critical talking to your friends and therapists or whatever, do you manage to get outside of this lower immediacy and this very personal private craziness into this public intelligibility, which is a terrifically important thing to do.

448
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:45,440
Only then are you in the position, when you get up here, to get up there without, in a way that distinguishes it from falling back into this.

449
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:49,040
That's, I'm going to talk about that for a while now.

450
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,239
Where are we?

451
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,480
But now, but there's no way.

452
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,959
I mean, here we help, you know, here he saved a role for philosophy, right?

453
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:16,000
But he can't, but on the other hand, philosophy can't understand becoming an individual in that higher immediacy way.

454
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,159
And that's the most important thing in the world to understand.

455
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:34,479
That's being the exception.

456
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,439
So he does two jobs at once.

457
00:45:42,439 --> 00:46:01,400
He sort of saves philosophy, but at the same time, because we're such a conflicted culture, which would begin back to the first lecture, he sort of throws the Greek thinking that philosophy is the highest thing, mediation is the highest thing, against the Judeo-Christian, which thinks that there's a higher immediacy.

458
00:46:01,399 --> 00:46:18,520
And that leads to this kind of conflict of cultures in which when Abraham is killing Isaac, he both thinks that this is the best thing he ever did, and he thinks it's the worst thing he ever did if he did it, or when Kierkegaard's breaking the engagement, or Benedict, and so, etc.

459
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:27,160
And whenever you get this conflict of the two cultures, you get anguish because there's no way to make sense of this.

460
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,519
This is paradoxical.

461
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:37,960
Here you are supposed to go against the ethical as the highest thing, but then the ethical, that's the Judeo-Christian commitment story.

462
00:46:37,959 --> 00:46:40,439
But then the ethical is supposed to be the highest thing.

463
00:46:40,439 --> 00:46:41,959
That's the final telos.

464
00:46:41,959 --> 00:46:45,159
That's the Greek Kant Hegel story.

465
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,520
How are you supposed to relate to the ethical?

466
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:56,839
And if you go against the ethical, you're in a terrible mess because you're completely unintelligible to yourself and everybody else.

467
00:46:57,959 --> 00:47:00,599
That's jumping ahead, the story.

468
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:05,880
But I want to just read on 60 just to show you where he sort of hits you with this.

469
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,320
About 15 lines down.

470
00:47:09,319 --> 00:47:13,720
The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he was willing to murder Isaac.

471
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:17,239
The religious expression is that he was willing to sacrifice Isaac.

472
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:22,800
That in this contradiction lies the very anguish that can indeed make one sleepless.

473
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:26,720
And yet, without that anguish, Abraham is not the one he is.

474
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:33,279
The anguish is always the kind of contradiction that's lurking in the background.

475
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:39,599
You remember last time anguish was only he who draws the knife will get Isaac.

476
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:44,399
That is, only one who is ready to lose the defining commitment can keep the defining commitment.

477
00:47:44,399 --> 00:47:46,320
That's one kind of anguish.

478
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,799
But now's a new kind of anguish.

479
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:58,560
Only he who can go against the ethical can, you know, really achieve the highest thing for you.

480
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:04,160
So put it this way: so the highest thing in the Greeks was the telos.

481
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,160
The telos was the goal.

482
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:09,040
The highest goal was to be ethical.

483
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,320
That is to get all this stuff up here to here.

484
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:19,520
Now we're told that the Judeo-Christians say there's a higher goal to have your own calling and be an individual.

485
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:21,520
Guess what we could call that?

486
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,040
We could call that the teleological suspension of the ethical.

487
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,200
That's what the name of this chapter is.

488
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:32,320
That means the highest thing requires you to go against the ethical.

489
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,640
Whereas for the Greeks, let me say it again: the ethical is the telos.

490
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,999
It is the highest thing.

491
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,520
It's the goal of human beings to become intelligible and view the universal.

492
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:48,080
On the Judeo-Christian story, there's a higher goal.

493
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:55,839
And in the name of that higher goal, namely your unconditional commitment, you have to go against the ethical.

494
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:00,160
That means the teleological suspension of the ethical.

495
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,599
Now, I've been talking and talking for a long time.

496
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:07,080
I'm sure somebody must have something to say about all this.

497
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:08,279
Yes.

498
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:20,040
The teleological suspension of the ethical is what the religious person, what faith is, in this talk, what Abraham.

499
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:30,759
What anybody who has the highest form of Judeo-Christian life, which he calls, which Kierkegaard's calling faith, has to be.

500
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,680
Now, I've got to make a very important distinction.

501
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,200
I'm glad you asked that.

502
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,239
I wanted to say has to suspend the ethical.

503
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:39,080
But that isn't quite true.

504
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:49,320
You might be lucky enough that you can marry your unconditional commitment boyfriend or girlfriend and live happily ever after.

505
00:49:49,319 --> 00:50:03,160
But if you have any imagination, you'll still be in anguish because you'll understand that your unconditional commitment could at any moment require you to go against the ethical, that you have a higher authority in your life than the ethical.

506
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:06,600
It's just accidental if you could stick with the ethical.

507
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:14,759
It's like the knight of faith, the girl he loves, the princess, may live all the rest of her life with him.

508
00:50:14,759 --> 00:50:21,239
But if he's got any imagination, he sees that it's vulnerable and that the sword is hanging over the head of the beloved.

509
00:50:21,239 --> 00:50:36,680
So now, if he's got any imagination, he sees that there's a higher authority than the ethical in his life, and at any moment he may be called to do something that he finds absolutely abhorrent, namely, like murder his son or break his engagement.

510
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:37,239
Yeah.

511
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:04,640
The greatness doesn't necessarily come from disparate state, but it comes from the concept.

512
00:51:05,279 --> 00:51:05,919
What does?

513
00:51:06,959 --> 00:51:08,320
Abraham's greatness.

514
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:09,440
Yes, good.

515
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:10,560
And why is that?

516
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:15,519
If Abraham could just dismiss the ethical, then he wouldn't have any anguish.

517
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:21,039
And now that's helpful because remember, I said that I haven't really made it clear enough yet.

518
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:31,759
Kierkegaard, I'll say it this way, Kierkegaard is the first and last of the existentialists who takes the philosophical Greek side seriously.

519
00:51:31,759 --> 00:51:40,640
And that's what makes, and understands the ethical as something you really need and that has authority in your life too, besides your commitment.

520
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,800
Namely, you need to be intelligible.

521
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:49,759
You need to be able to explain to yourself and everybody else what you're up to, otherwise you think you're crazy and they think you're crazy.

522
00:51:49,759 --> 00:51:51,840
So there you are.

523
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:59,759
It turns out that the greatness of what he builds into Abraham, don't mind the sort of historical anachronism that Abraham didn't know any Greek.

524
00:51:59,759 --> 00:52:00,720
That never mind.

525
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,119
The real Abraham is Kierkegaard.

526
00:52:03,439 --> 00:52:15,279
And the Christian has this higher thing and sees the necessity of and totally respects the ethical.

527
00:52:15,279 --> 00:52:17,359
Now I want to just do a quick run-through.

528
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:24,160
I was going to do it later, but I go to it now if I can find it, where I talk about this more.

529
00:52:26,799 --> 00:52:27,919
Have I skipped it?

530
00:52:27,919 --> 00:52:28,800
No?

531
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,479
I can make it up again.

532
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:37,239
I'd rather find out where I am.

533
00:52:56,439 --> 00:53:03,560
Well, I'll just tell you, but I'm not until I look a little longer, because it makes me nervous to think that I don't know where I am.

534
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:07,960
But not the first time I didn't know where I was, so it's all right.

535
00:53:07,959 --> 00:53:08,999
Ah, I got it.

536
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,839
I skipped it a long time ago.

537
00:53:10,839 --> 00:53:14,520
I've been feeling that I should have said it sometime when I put the chart on the board.

538
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,440
So let me say it right now.

539
00:53:16,439 --> 00:53:33,880
It just helps to see that all the other existentialists, you'll see when you get to Nietzsche, that he thinks the ethical is a good thing as a means to strengthening your will and your character, but you have to outgrow it, leave it behind.

540
00:53:33,879 --> 00:53:40,519
The true highest person for Nietzsche doesn't let themselves be bothered by the ethical, like Dr.

541
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:45,400
Skalnikov, who's very Nietzsche in crime and punishment.

542
00:53:45,399 --> 00:53:50,919
And Heidegger thinks that the ethical is just the voice of conformism.

543
00:53:50,919 --> 00:53:57,399
And that's that if you're going to be in Heidegger jargon authentic, you don't pay attention to the ethical.

544
00:53:57,399 --> 00:54:02,040
You do your own unique individual thing.

545
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:05,960
And Thart in The Flies, how many of you read The Fly?

546
00:54:06,279 --> 00:54:10,599
If I were teaching existentialism in high school or something, I would read The Flies.

547
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:25,680
But anyway, in The Flies, Zeus talks to Orestes about how, thanks to the ethical, Zeus manages to keep men from knowing their freedom because they think they have to obey all these universal laws.

548
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:31,680
Those are all ways, and Dostoevsky, too, you'll see.

549
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,200
Ask yourself what Dostoevsky thinks of philosophy.

550
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:40,479
And you'll discover in a word, philosophers are sick, according to Dostoevsky.

551
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:47,759
The idea that philosophers were onto something important in Greece, Kierkegaard is the only one who's got it.

552
00:54:47,759 --> 00:54:50,080
After that, it drops out.

553
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:53,920
I think that's one of the big merits of Kierkegaard, to see that.

554
00:54:54,399 --> 00:54:56,559
That there's lots of truth in philosophy.

555
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,640
There's just something higher, too.

556
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:11,840
Remember, I read on 97, that's where I was going to talk about this, where it talks about philosophy is right to say that you should get rid of the lower immediacy, feelings, moods, swims, phobias, and all that sort of thing.

557
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:13,519
Okay, now I wonder what else I skipped.

558
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,640
Let's see.

559
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,759
I think that's it.

560
00:55:19,759 --> 00:55:21,759
Anybody more things to say?

561
00:55:21,759 --> 00:55:22,559
Yeah.

562
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,080
Ah, is the night of resignation?

563
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:30,799
I'm trying to remember to repeat the questions for the podcast.

564
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:34,960
Let's see if it's the night of faith and say it again.

565
00:55:36,879 --> 00:55:40,080
Okay, is the night of resignation an individual?

566
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:43,120
Yes, but with qualifications that are important.

567
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:47,839
When you see the woman in Hiroshima Monomur, you see that she's a complete individual.

568
00:55:48,399 --> 00:55:55,120
She's suspicious of ethics, and she's totally defined by her commitment.

569
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,200
Being an individual doesn't mean being a knight of faith.

570
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:06,040
Being an individual means having an unconditional commitment that makes you, gives you a definition.

571
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:22,200
It's important to realize that there are ways of being knights of resignation, like Augustine and Dante, that turn the defining commitment away from being individual to some kind of universal God.

572
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:28,120
And those knights of resignation are not individuals.

573
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:33,159
But you can be a knight of resignation and be an individual, and that's what the movie is supposed to show.

574
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,440
She is one.

575
00:56:34,759 --> 00:56:36,279
And what's the test?

576
00:56:36,279 --> 00:56:44,840
Well, the question is: is there some particular relation in your life that gives your life meaning and gives your world meaning and defines who you are?

577
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,440
She's got that.

578
00:56:46,759 --> 00:56:48,919
Too much of it, you know, certain points.

579
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,639
Okay, anything else?

580
00:56:53,239 --> 00:56:57,159
I have a feeling I didn't repeat your question that nobody's perfect.

581
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,800
Okay, let's go on.

582
00:57:00,759 --> 00:57:20,759
I'm now going to tell you another way, because it's important you'll come across it, that the Greeks had a way of dealing with something like the Abraham-Isaac story in a way that shows the importance of philosophy and mediation.

583
00:57:20,759 --> 00:57:24,039
And that's the Agamemnon story, the tragic hero story.

584
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:33,720
If you don't keep in mind, Kierkegaard thinks, contrasting the tragic hero and the knight of faith, you won't really fully understand the night of faith.

585
00:57:33,720 --> 00:58:01,200
So, what happens, real quick, like, he runs through it fast, and I'll run through it even faster, that there is a situation in which Agamemnon gets, goes out to fight the Trojan War, but he gets stranded on an island and that you can't go on, and the soldiers are revolting, and they're hungry, and people are sick.

586
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:10,880
And the prophet says, unless you kill your daughter Ephigenia, you can't go on this mission to get back Helen and conquer Troy.

587
00:58:10,879 --> 00:58:19,600
I can't resist saying one brilliant thing that a colleague of mine who just died recently, Joe Tussman, who was a philosophy professor here, said about this.

588
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:28,400
Nobody has ever, I think, tried to understand why the prophet told Agamemnon that he had to sacrifice his daughter if he was going to go to war.

589
00:58:28,399 --> 00:58:42,399
And Tussman says, what the prophet is saying is: if you're willing to send all these other young men and women, these young people, to war where they're going to get killed, you have to be willing to have one of your own children killed.

590
00:58:42,399 --> 00:58:54,080
It's like saying, Bush, if you aren't going to send some child or grandchild of yours to the Iraq war where they might well be killed, you have no right to be treating in this war.

591
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:55,599
So that's what the prophet says.

592
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,759
It's very smart on the part of Aeschylus.

593
00:58:57,759 --> 00:59:00,640
And Agamemnon sees that this is right.

594
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,680
And then he kills Ephigenia.

595
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:07,040
And what do people think about this?

596
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,880
Well, they think it's terrific.

597
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:11,520
They all admire him as a hero.

598
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,520
That's what's interesting about it.

599
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:18,639
Because by the local standards of what's good, he has done what's good.

600
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:26,560
He has sacrificed his love and his father job and his for a higher ethical.

601
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:29,200
He suspended one ethical by another.

602
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,480
His higher ethical was to do his duty as king.

603
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,839
And it turned out that to do his duty as king, he had to make this sacrifice.

604
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:41,559
And the amazingly good and impressive thing was he was strong enough to do it.

605
00:59:41,879 --> 00:59:43,560
This is on 87.

606
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:50,599
So you read at the bottom: the difference between the tragic hero and Abraham is obvious enough.

607
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,999
The tragic hero stays within the ethical.

608
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,560
He lets an expression of the ethical have its telos and a higher expression of the ethical.

609
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:11,000
He reduces the ethical relation of father and son or daughter and father to a sentiment, that is to a feeling, that has its dialectic, that is, its higher thing, in relation to the ethical life.

610
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:17,959
That may not be as illuminating as you like, so let me see if I can find another.

611
01:00:17,959 --> 01:00:23,799
At the middle of the page, Abraham's whole action stands in no relation to the universal.

612
01:00:23,799 --> 01:00:24,839
That's the opposite.

613
01:00:24,839 --> 01:00:26,840
It is purely private.

614
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:38,600
While then the tragic hero is great through his deeds being an expression of the ethical, Abraham is great through an act of purely personal virtue, going against the ethical.

615
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:43,640
So let's see, is that enough to make this distinction clear?

616
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,840
I think it should be, but let me see if I'm missing anything.

617
01:00:48,919 --> 01:00:52,279
And every, oh, it's important because we've been talking about mediation.

618
01:00:52,279 --> 01:00:57,879
It's important that Agamemnon can say what he did, and everybody can understand what he did.

619
01:00:57,879 --> 01:01:00,759
It's all completely intelligible, what I just said.

620
01:01:00,759 --> 01:01:03,479
We can all almost get inside of a culture.

621
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,120
We just did.

622
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:12,759
I mean, in our culture, if the president, if the commander-in-chief isn't ready to sacrifice his child, he has no right to sacrifice anybody's child.

623
01:01:12,759 --> 01:01:14,200
We can all say, yeah, that's right.

624
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:19,479
And if he's brave enough to draft his child and send them off to Iraq, that's admirable.

625
01:01:19,919 --> 01:01:21,999
Okay, so where are we?

626
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,320
We're on page 103.

627
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:32,800
That's where he talks about what?

628
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,759
Let's see.

629
01:01:33,759 --> 01:01:34,399
Where?

630
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:35,359
At the bottom.

631
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:42,320
The knight of faith knows it gives inspiration to surrender oneself to the universal, that it takes courage to do so.

632
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:48,400
That is, the knight of faith even admires Agamemnon, but also that there is a certain security in it.

633
01:01:48,399 --> 01:01:53,839
Just because it is for the universal, he knows it is glorious to be understood by every noble mind.

634
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:55,520
See, that's Agamemnon.

635
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:59,600
And in such a way that even the beholder is ennobled.

636
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,800
That's what the tragic hero does.

637
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:04,399
Let's look at the middle of 105.

638
01:02:04,399 --> 01:02:06,080
The tragic hero is soon finished.

639
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,279
His struggle is at an end.

640
01:02:07,279 --> 01:02:10,880
He makes the infinite movement and now safe in the universal.

641
01:02:10,879 --> 01:02:13,039
But the knight of faith, he can't do that.

642
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:19,680
He's kept awake, for he is under constant trial and can turn back in repentance to the universal at any moment.

643
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,320
And this will be a temptation.

644
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,079
We'll talk about that more later.

645
01:02:24,399 --> 01:02:27,439
That would be too hard to do at this point.

646
01:02:27,439 --> 01:02:28,720
I'll save again.

647
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,239
Let's see now.

648
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:33,759
Well, okay.

649
01:02:45,279 --> 01:02:48,560
At the top of 89, just to see the difference again.

650
01:02:48,879 --> 01:02:53,840
Abraham can't be mediated, which can also be put by saying he cannot speak.

651
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:58,320
The moment I speak, I express the universal, that is the shared intelligibility.

652
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:00,800
And when I do not, no one can understand me.

653
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:07,160
So the moment Abraham wants to express himself in the universal, he has to say that his situation is one of temptation.

654
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:16,920
Because sometimes the nearest way to understand that is whenever Abraham tries to say to anybody what he's up to, all he can say is, I'm a murderer.

655
01:03:16,919 --> 01:03:18,039
To himself, even.

656
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:20,519
There's no other description in the shared language.

657
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:25,640
Let's suppose they don't understand what sacrifice means, which Kierkegaard thinks nobody understands.

658
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:37,239
And if God wrote in the sky, it's okay for Abraham to sacrifice Isaac because I really like that, and I call out a sacrifice, and everybody gets a new vocabulary, and they say, ah, oh, we see, that's good.

659
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,920
Abraham is a hero.

660
01:03:38,919 --> 01:03:40,360
But he doesn't like that.

661
01:03:40,359 --> 01:03:42,680
Nobody understands what sacrifice means.

662
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:46,520
And Abraham's out trying to kill his son, and Abraham doesn't understand it either.

663
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,439
Abraham just knows he has to do it.

664
01:03:48,439 --> 01:03:52,759
It's somehow, it's his calling, but he doesn't know why he's doing it.

665
01:03:52,759 --> 01:03:54,439
He can't say why he's doing it.

666
01:03:54,439 --> 01:04:01,640
I think that's why Kierkegaard thinks he can't explain to Regina or himself or anybody else why he has to break his engagement in the lever.

667
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:04,759
But something higher is calling him to do it.

668
01:04:04,759 --> 01:04:10,199
That's the situation very different from Agamemnon's.

669
01:04:15,319 --> 01:04:21,320
There are lots of places where you can find where Abraham, if he speaks, says he's a murderer or would.

670
01:04:21,319 --> 01:04:24,759
Let's see, let's on the top of 95.

671
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:28,999
So Abraham's story contains a teleological suspension of the ethical.

672
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,239
He has, as the single individual, never mind a single.

673
01:04:33,959 --> 01:04:36,120
I don't know, sir, how can you do this?

674
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:36,919
Okay.

675
01:04:37,319 --> 01:04:39,319
Become higher than the universal.

676
01:04:39,319 --> 01:04:41,960
This is a paradox which cannot be mediated.

677
01:04:41,959 --> 01:04:45,239
How he got into it is inexplicable and how he stayed in it.

678
01:04:45,239 --> 01:04:50,400
If this is how it is with Abraham, then he is not even a tragic hero, but a murderer.

679
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:56,160
The one who goes on calling him the father of the faith, to talk of those and so forth, is thoughtless.

680
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:05,279
And then skipping a little, when a person sets out on a tragic hero's admittedly hard path, there are many who could lend him advice.

681
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:07,279
It's out in the public domain.

682
01:05:07,279 --> 01:05:11,279
But he who walks the narrow path of faith, no one can advise him.

683
01:05:11,279 --> 01:05:13,040
No one understands.

684
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:18,319
And you even, I see if I can flip to it, you think you're crazy if you're doing this sort of thing.

685
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:19,840
You are sort of crazy.

686
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:28,080
Here on bottom of 85, again, so Abraham suspends the ethical in that last paragraph.

687
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:37,439
I thought it was...

688
01:05:37,439 --> 01:05:39,680
Hmm, that's not the one I want.

689
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:43,519
I want to show you where he talks about being crazy.

690
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:48,000
I think it's in number two.

691
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:53,120
Ah, here we are, on 103.

692
01:05:53,439 --> 01:05:56,640
Just after where he says, have I read this?

693
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:57,439
I think so.

694
01:05:57,439 --> 01:06:01,439
He knows it's beautiful to make a translation of himself into the universal.

695
01:06:01,439 --> 01:06:02,720
Didn't I read that earlier today?

696
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,080
Or am I imagining?

697
01:06:04,399 --> 01:06:05,039
Did I?

698
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:05,359
Good.

699
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:15,840
Well, if you now go skipping down below that, he knows it's beautiful to be born as the particular good with the universalist home, his friendly abode, and so forth and so forth.

700
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:22,319
He also knows, this is what we didn't read, that higher up there winds a lonely path, narrow and steep.

701
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:28,640
He knows it is terrible to be born in solitude outside the universal, to walk without meeting a single traveler.

702
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:32,959
He knows very well where he is and how he is related to men.

703
01:06:32,959 --> 01:06:38,839
Humanly speaking, he is insane and cannot make himself understood by anyone.

704
01:06:39,159 --> 01:06:42,519
And yet, insane is the mildest expression for him.

705
01:06:43,079 --> 01:06:46,119
Now, I remember, keep saying to yourself, what would it be for him to be insane?

706
01:06:46,119 --> 01:06:50,759
Well, it would be every time he tries to understand, he knows that what he's doing is the most important thing.

707
01:06:50,759 --> 01:06:52,199
It's part of his calling.

708
01:06:52,199 --> 01:06:57,079
And every time he tries to understand what he's doing, all he can say is, I'm a murderer.

709
01:06:57,079 --> 01:07:07,079
Now, what I want to do now, by the way, before I forget, I want you to read for next time a little bit more than I've ever had that I had in the assignment.

710
01:07:07,079 --> 01:07:10,680
Just before I want to put it on the board now, because I might forget.

711
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:14,680
It's just 137 to 139.

712
01:07:14,999 --> 01:07:18,680
We're going to need that very crucial later.

713
01:07:19,959 --> 01:07:22,759
But right now, I want to do the following.

714
01:07:22,759 --> 01:07:26,999
For the rest of the time, first, I want to see everybody happy?

715
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:30,279
I think I can turn this into a more controversial thing.

716
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:31,799
But go ahead.

717
01:07:33,079 --> 01:07:36,759
Obviously, that Abraham.

718
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:47,320
In the sense that, I mean, you're the entire name of this person that I remember when Henry and God said, and you're the ones who get it.

719
01:07:48,039 --> 01:07:54,759
I mean, he's a little to this homonym.

720
01:07:54,839 --> 01:08:00,279
Hey, I'm committed to God, and this is my challenge of God that I'm going to kill.

721
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:02,359
But they won't understand that.

722
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:03,079
I mean, you can't.

723
01:08:03,159 --> 01:08:08,600
I mean, they'll say, Sarah's going to say, you're going to kill your only, your favorite son.

724
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:12,999
You're going to kill the one who's defining commitment, who's going to make you the father of the faith.

725
01:08:13,159 --> 01:08:13,959
What is this, God?

726
01:08:13,959 --> 01:08:16,359
And how do you know you got any message from God?

727
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:20,320
If he could mediate it, that's what I meant by writing and skywriting.

728
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:25,759
If God had said, I know what I told Abraham to do it, it's a sacrifice, it's perfectly all right.

729
01:08:26,079 --> 01:08:33,759
But there isn't anything like that, and it doesn't, with Agamemnon, everybody knows that it's right, it's the right thing to do.

730
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:39,919
They certainly don't think that just because Abraham goes around saying sacrifice, it's okay, sacrifice.

731
01:08:39,919 --> 01:08:44,399
And notice, according to Kierkegaard, anyway, Abraham doesn't say anything.

732
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:53,119
He never says anything to Isaac or Sarah because he knows that nobody will understand him, because he knows he doesn't even understand what he's saying.

733
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:55,600
So he's not going to be justifying what he's doing.

734
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,999
I mean, that's good you said that.

735
01:08:57,999 --> 01:09:02,320
Sorry, I didn't repeat the question, but it was that iPod crowd is not.

736
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:03,039
Sorry about that.

737
01:09:05,119 --> 01:09:06,159
So, okay.

738
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:17,999
But now I want to give you a phenomenon so that this won't sound like psychological or theological science fiction or something to you.

739
01:09:17,999 --> 01:09:28,560
There's some real experience behind this idea that you are an exception and you're called to be an exception.

740
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,959
And it's the best thing you ever did.

741
01:09:30,959 --> 01:09:33,359
And yet, it's totally wrong.

742
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:36,959
And whenever you try to describe it, you can only condemn it.

743
01:09:36,959 --> 01:09:47,839
And there are probably other examples, but the perfect example of this is what it would be like to be a homosexual, to be gay, in Copenhagen in 1850.

744
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:49,999
Now, maybe Kierkegaard was gay.

745
01:09:49,999 --> 01:09:53,520
There is some interest in this, but lots of gossip.

746
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:58,959
And he talked about the thorn in his flesh, which he couldn't, which kept him from marrying Regina.

747
01:09:58,959 --> 01:10:03,359
And he bore pages out of his journal where he was describing it, and so forth.

748
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,799
But it doesn't matter whether it was true or not.

749
01:10:06,039 --> 01:10:08,359
What I want to describe is the phenomenon.

750
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:25,399
If you're in a culture in which the vocabulary of what's worthy and unworthy is such that gays are sick, depraved, perverse, queer, all kinds of bad things.

751
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,640
And there's nothing good you could say about them.

752
01:10:28,199 --> 01:10:31,799
They're just a hopeless, bad, bad way to be.

753
01:10:32,119 --> 01:10:45,640
So now let's imagine Kierkegaard is in love with somebody, call him John, and now Kierkegaard feels that loving John is the most important and best thing in his life, and he's called to do it.

754
01:10:46,039 --> 01:10:48,119
It's an absolute calling.

755
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:53,479
And then he tries to describe to himself or say to himself what he's doing.

756
01:10:53,480 --> 01:11:01,959
And all he can say to himself is, I'm doing a disgusting, perverted, evil, wrong, lower immediate thing.

757
01:11:01,959 --> 01:11:11,879
And that's what it's like to, that's my equivalent of this fancy talk of Abraham not being able to say anything but that he's a murderer.

758
01:11:11,879 --> 01:11:19,799
I want to say that in 1850 Copenhagen, there was nothing somebody gave could say to themselves except I'm a pervert.

759
01:11:19,799 --> 01:11:32,039
And they, and then, just to bring in another little piece of it, Kierkegaard talks about when you're in, when you're suspending the ethical, you also have a temptation.

760
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:34,119
I mean, we've got to have more words.

761
01:11:34,119 --> 01:11:43,239
There's temptation, and then there is something that we need a name for what's pulling you down or up.

762
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:49,079
There is some kind of thing which we're going to have to call, I'm going to call it an attraction.

763
01:11:49,079 --> 01:11:50,400
We don't have any word for it.

764
01:11:54,079 --> 01:12:01,600
But now, when you've got an unconditional commitment, you've also got something like a temptation.

765
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:05,680
What's the temptation for the night of faith?

766
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,480
With my example, you ought to be able to figure it out.

767
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,479
Without it, it would be harder.

768
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:11,359
Right?

769
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,440
No, John is not the temptation.

770
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:18,799
John is the one he loves, and he knows that's absolutely right, and he knows that it's absolutely wrong.

771
01:12:18,799 --> 01:12:21,439
Yes.

772
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:22,720
That's right.

773
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:24,640
The temptation is the ethical.

774
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:35,839
If you're gay, the temptation in Copenhagen is to be straight, to get married and have children and be intelligible to yourself and everybody else.

775
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:38,239
So there, and Kierkegaard has a name for this.

776
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:39,759
He calls it a trial.

777
01:12:39,759 --> 01:12:46,799
When a trial is to, is like the temptation.

778
01:12:46,799 --> 01:12:49,919
It's the attraction of the universal.

779
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:58,079
And here, where the attraction of the universal is a good thing to get out of your lower immediacy, fear the temptation is a bad thing.

780
01:12:58,079 --> 01:13:02,959
It's to betray your unconditional commitment in the name of the universal.

781
01:13:02,959 --> 01:13:05,119
And now it helps to understand that.

782
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:08,319
By the way, a lot of you probably have seen Brokeback Mountain by now.

783
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,279
I haven't.

784
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:14,879
Is it going to help understand the temptation of the ethical to the gay?

785
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:15,999
Why?

786
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:18,159
And how?

787
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:19,519
Is that what you say?

788
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,039
What do you all say?

789
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:23,999
Let's watch it.

790
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,999
How many have seen it already?

791
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,600
You see, it's too late to watch.

792
01:13:27,759 --> 01:13:30,239
How many thinks it belongs in this course?

793
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,159
I mean, given what we're talking about.

794
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,999
I mean, is there a conflict?

795
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,320
I have to go see it.

796
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:45,239
There ought to be a conflict in it between knowing what you really care about as an individual and what makes your life meaningful and the ethical.

797
01:13:46,039 --> 01:13:50,439
And I gather it's a sad movie because the ethical wins out.

798
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:52,039
Okay, well, I have to go see it.

799
01:13:52,039 --> 01:13:54,919
But you have the categories to think about it.

800
01:13:54,919 --> 01:13:56,600
Now, wait, but don't get ready to go.

801
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:03,480
Every minute counts because I'm very worried that I'm not going to be able to cover everything I need before that I have to give up on care, you guys.

802
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,600
So let me think.

803
01:14:08,039 --> 01:14:09,640
Yeah, yeah.

804
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:10,999
I did what I had to do.

805
01:14:10,999 --> 01:14:12,759
Okay, that's it.
