1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Let's go back to the brothers.

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:15,279
So remember that we have these questions left over from last time, and they are the, and I just so that I said them very quickly and cryptically last time.

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,880
Let me remind you more.

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:39,519
Remember that in the way back once upon a time, when we were doing the Grand Inquisitor, there was always an antinomy in which Jesus represented one view, namely the Protestant extreme Kierkegaardian view, and the Grand Inquisitor represented the sort of philosophically influenced Roman Catholic view.

5
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:47,039
And they were both wrong from the way each one could show that the other one was terrible and propose.

6
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:56,959
And there was somewhere in the book going to be a third possibility which resolves antinomies, which shows that you don't have to take either of these bad views.

7
00:00:56,959 --> 00:01:02,720
And they can't argue for themselves by showing that the other view is even worse because there's a view that's fine.

8
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,479
And that's the Russian Orthodox.

9
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:11,519
But we haven't got the answer to what the church would be, what a religious community would be.

10
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:14,959
The Jesus figure says you can't have any community.

11
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:17,599
Everyone has to directly relate to God.

12
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:24,079
That's why confession is bad, but that's why, remember, the last thing Kierkegaard wrote, I told you, was the attack on Christendom.

13
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,479
That's why the whole Lutheran church is bad.

14
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,479
It gets in between people and their private, personal, direct relation to God.

15
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:35,839
Very Protestant way of thinking about it.

16
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,559
But the Grand Inquisitor view looks equally bad.

17
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,919
He wants to turn the world into a universal ante.

18
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:50,239
That is, by which he means we'll have an objective truth, a creed that everybody in Christendom will subscribe to.

19
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,159
It'll be a bunch of claims or principles or truths.

20
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:06,279
You can write them down in the Creed, and everybody will agree that that's the truth, that Jesus was born of the Virgin Mary and this and this and saved everybody in this way and so forth.

21
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,840
And that would make everybody just making religion a kind of conformism.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,359
That doesn't seem right.

23
00:02:14,359 --> 00:02:20,359
So what is the right answer to religious, to what is a church and what is a community?

24
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:22,359
That's one question left.

25
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:31,479
Another question nobody's solved or even tried yet, and the Grand Inquisitor doesn't really take it on, is what is immortality?

26
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,040
What happens to people when they die?

27
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:40,919
And remember, that's left over from the fact that both the old Karamatsov and Mrs.

28
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:47,639
Holokov confessed that that's what really drives them crazy is the worry about what happens when you die.

29
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:50,040
So we have to have some story about that.

30
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:57,720
And all through it, we've been giving, on the third point, through the whole book, we've been giving meanings to the Karamatsov.

31
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:08,679
And the Karamatsov has always stood for the dark side, the animal, the impulsive, and sensuous, and so forth, earthy.

32
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:14,839
And now we're going to find out the right way to think about what it is to be a Karamatsov.

33
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:31,799
And finally, we're going to discover how, in the third stage, Christianity, we're going to get a hint anyway, of how in the third stage, Christianity is going to go out into the world and save the world, so that the star will arise in the East.

34
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:38,919
Russian Orthodox Christianity will finally transform everybody, and we will be in paradise here and now.

35
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,959
That's the promise.

36
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:47,280
He doesn't say in detail how it's going to work or when it's going to happen, but he gives you a hint about how it's going to work and how it's going to happen.

37
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:51,280
Okay, a lot to do in an hour, five minutes.

38
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,880
It's even more amazing that Dostoevsky does it in one chapter at the end of the book.

39
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,559
He takes on all these questions and gives his answer to them.

40
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,000
So here we go.

41
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:21,440
So, Kolya, we've got to start with the fact that Alyasha gets related to a bunch of boys by way of Kolya, who is important because he's sort of the young Russia, the future of Russia.

42
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:27,040
And there is this sort of struggle over his soul between the usual angel and the devil.

43
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:35,199
I think maybe it just occurs to me: the more important people have the more important angels and the more important devils fighting over their soul.

44
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:44,239
So, over Dmitry, it's head-on Rakitin with Alyasha, the head devil against the head angel, and it is over Kolya, too.

45
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,959
Alyasha and Rakitin are competing for Kolya's allegiance, for his soul.

46
00:04:51,519 --> 00:05:03,599
And you can see this in 524.

47
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,320
Okay, 524.

48
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,639
Well, he's just talking to Kolya, and Kolya's, but it's just an interesting conversation.

49
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:20,479
I mean, I was looking to see how the place where you can see that they're competing is a little further.

50
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:28,320
But they're talking about God, and Kolya is saying in the middle of the page, God is only a hypothesis.

51
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,079
And I admit he's needed, and blah, blah, blah.

52
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,079
And Kalya is trying to show off.

53
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:41,880
And then he says, It's possible for one who doesn't believe in God to love mankind, don't you think?

54
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,599
Voltaire didn't believe in God and he loved mankind.

55
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:46,839
And he thinks to himself, I'm at it again.

56
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:54,120
And the interesting thing is, I just read it because it's interesting and confirms the view that God is the connectedness.

57
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:02,120
Because Alyasha answers, Voltaire believed in God, though not very much, I think, and I don't think he loved mankind very much either.

58
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:10,680
Which means sort of the amount of you believe in God and the amount you love mankind and feel the connectedness is the same.

59
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,440
And that it's something you're used to, it's just a new angle on it.

60
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,399
God is the field of relatedness.

61
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:30,199
So, but the crucial thing for the angel devil is that Kalya admits on page 525 that he got all this talk from Raketin.

62
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,959
He says that about two-thirds of the way down.

63
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:37,239
It happens that I have often talked to Rakitin, the divinity student, and so forth and so forth.

64
00:06:38,199 --> 00:07:04,760
And so they're fighting over whether Kalya is going to be a Christian of this new secularized, outside the monastery sort, or whether he's going to be the new man of the socialist sort who believes in neurons and materialism and selfishness for everybody that Rakitin believes in.

65
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:18,240
And he gives a kind of parody of the kind of socialism that, where is it, 528?

66
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,679
Well, I don't really have much of a quote.

67
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,320
It's just that it's again clear that Rakitin's the devil.

68
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:38,880
The middle of 528, Alyasha says, the devil has taken the form of vanity and entered in the whole generation.

69
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,320
It's the devil, added Alyasha, without a trace of the smile.

70
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:47,199
That's when Alyasha is sort of head-on fighting Rakitin.

71
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,240
And he saves Kalya in just the way that he saved Grushenka.

72
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,399
In a way, it's sort of almost boring.

73
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,520
I mean, it's so similar.

74
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:10,239
Dostoevsky might have come up with something different, but he just reruns the fact that Grushenka needed to be affirmed as really a worthwhile person to be able to love and do worthwhile things.

75
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:17,279
And the same thing happens on 527 with Kolya about two-thirds of the way down.

76
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:28,800
He asks, Kolya asks about his vanity and willfulness that he can't get rid of.

77
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:35,120
And he says, and Alyasha says, no, you have a good nature, but it's been distorted by Rakitin.

78
00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:41,679
And I understand now why you have had such an influence on the sensitive boy, on Ilusha, on all the boys.

79
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,279
Kalya's the leader of the boys.

80
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,639
That's why it's so important, the struggle for him.

81
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,760
And Kalia says, you say that to me, cried Kolya.

82
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,720
Would you believe it?

83
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,400
I thought, I thought several times since I've been here that you despise me.

84
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:58,240
If you only knew how I prized your opinion.

85
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,760
Does that sound familiar?

86
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,440
It's exactly the same thing that happened with Kushenka.

87
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:11,480
She cared so much for Alyosha's opinion, and when she discovered that he didn't despise her, she could do good things.

88
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:15,720
And immediately Kalia starts being an angel for Ilusha.

89
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:28,520
And Smerzhikov was the devil for Ilya, because Smerzhikov taught Alicia to put the pin in the dog food and the meat and throw it, and then so the dog ate the meat and then went around howling from the pin in his stomach.

90
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:33,240
And Alysha feels terrible about that, and Alysa is dying.

91
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:44,680
And Kalia is trying to, we'll try to show him, we'll give him the impression anyway before he dies, that the dog hadn't really died.

92
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:55,160
But the main thing is that he's feeling terrible because on 507, you learn that Smerzhikov has taught him to put the pin in the bread.

93
00:09:55,159 --> 00:10:03,320
And in the end, the boys, thanks to Kolya, bring another dog, and Ilusha, who's dying of T V dies happily.

94
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:05,399
And now, that's just background.

95
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,440
I mean, it's helpful.

96
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,039
It's not irrelevant.

97
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:15,880
But now the really big issues arise: the church and the issue of immortality and how to say Russia.

98
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,840
So it's, again, that's all thought around Ilusha's death.

99
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:40,840
So the first thing to notice, and this is just Dostoevsky at his best, and critics at their worst, is that just as the critics seem to think stupidly, that Smerzhikov repents because he's reading this religious book, so, and Dostoevsky seems to lay the trap for the critic.

100
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:47,600
After all, he didn't have to put that the sayings of Isaac the Syrian in the day that Smershikov had been reading it.

101
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:53,120
But he certainly is, it's sort of like a test to see if you can understand what's going on.

102
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,559
Well, here's another test.

103
00:10:54,559 --> 00:11:02,240
What turns out that on the bottom of 722, strange to say, there was no smell of decay from the corpse.

104
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,000
Now, Alicia's died.

105
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,560
He's there, lying there before he's buried, and his body is smelling sweet.

106
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:17,280
And now, does that show that Alicia is a saint and that there's something wrong with Zosima?

107
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,120
That's what critics think.

108
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,440
They immediately think, well, Dostoevsky wouldn't have put that in there if he didn't pay that.

109
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:32,720
It didn't mean that in some way Alicia is better than Zosima, that Zosima has some flaw that Alicia doesn't, and then they worry around trying to find it.

110
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,720
What's really going on there?

111
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:41,760
You know, why is Alicia's body sweet in a way that Zosima's didn't?

112
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,399
Yes, flowers.

113
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,440
Who said that?

114
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:46,000
Good.

115
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:54,159
Yes, at the top of the chapter, he goes out of the way to say that the little flower-decked coffin, but that's not, it's not just flowers.

116
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:55,680
Anything else?

117
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:56,399
Yeah.

118
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:58,480
What?

119
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,160
Yes, I couldn't find the reference, but I believe the windows are open.

120
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:04,800
I am too.

121
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,400
Somewhere, if somebody ever finds the women, the windows are open, let me know.

122
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,399
But more, what else?

123
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,520
Yeah.

124
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,000
It's season, it's cold.

125
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,279
The frost is on the ground.

126
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,760
It's cold in autumn, apparently, in Russia, not surprisingly.

127
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,880
So it's cold, whereas it was a warm autumn evening.

128
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:25,440
Autumn seems to be an uneven month.

129
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,600
When Zosima died, we're told that the flowers were blooming.

130
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,000
But at this time, we're told it was cold autumn and there was frost on the flowers.

131
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,240
And one more thing, what else?

132
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,959
Well, this one is you have to read between the lines.

133
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,600
Yeah.

134
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,120
Exactly.

135
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,399
He doesn't bother to say they washed the body, but he bothers to say that they didn't wash Zosima's body.

136
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,840
So now you run through it.

137
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,919
Why does Zosima's body sink?

138
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:51,880
It wasn't washed.

139
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,320
The windows were closed.

140
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:55,720
It was warm, and there were no flowers.

141
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,039
And why does Ilusha's body smell sweet?

142
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,720
And it's not strange to say at all that, you know, that we just ran through them.

143
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,519
Washed, cold, flowers, windows open.

144
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:13,320
And what's the moral of that that the critics miss and that Dostoevsky is clear about?

145
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,199
What are you supposed to conclude?

146
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,679
Yeah.

147
00:13:22,439 --> 00:13:23,639
That's right.

148
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,320
There's nothing that goes against the laws of physics and chemistry.

149
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:31,880
The laws of physics and chemistry explain completely what goes on with the bodies.

150
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:38,040
The laws of physics and chemistry aren't in the existential judgment of the goodness of these people's business.

151
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:42,520
And Dostoevsky makes that clear in this neat way.

152
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,760
So, let's see now.

153
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,799
So they're both saints in a way.

154
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:56,520
But that is Awesome and Ilusha because they bring Agate love into the, help bring Agate love into the world.

155
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:07,880
Ilusha brings out the love in the boys as he dies so nicely, as Markle brings out and expresses the love when he dies, and so forth.

156
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,600
And otherwise, it's just plain natural.

157
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:20,800
The laws of chemistry are inexorable, of physics, and chemistry are inexorable but irrelevant, to put it in a nutshell.

158
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:23,360
That's what Dostoevsky thinks.

159
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,600
And both deaths create miracles of love.

160
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:43,519
We have seen, and remember, that Dossima's death turns Alyasha's love free to go on to be shot, be shot at Grushenka, as Rakitin says, and that saves Grushenka, and it's a miracle, we're told by Rakitin, and so forth.

161
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:54,960
And Alicia's does, we aren't told that Alicia isn't a miracle, but he also generates love in all these boys, and that has a wonderful effect, different than a miracle, a new effect.

162
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,800
And what is that new effect?

163
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:03,920
Well, first, for those who are Christians, you'll get it with Dostoevsky.

164
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:13,120
You know, you always are looking, what's going on when they bury Alyusha, and the speech, the funeral speech on 722.

165
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:20,320
Well, the funeral speech is given at the stone, Alicia's favorite stone.

166
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:28,080
And does that already remind anybody, anybody who knows the New Testament of anything?

167
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,720
Somebody must know.

168
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:37,200
Peter gets the keys to the kingdom to found the church at a rock from Jesus.

169
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,519
And so you're there, bang, over your head.

170
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,120
Something's happening at this rock, and what's happening at this rock has something to do with the founding of a church.

171
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,039
But the more, almost like a joke, how many boys were present?

172
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,000
Twelve of them, right?

173
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,480
It says so at the top of 722.

174
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,519
That's interesting.

175
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,760
There were 12 disciples.

176
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,639
So there we are.

177
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,360
I mean, Dostoevsky is not messing around.

178
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:08,520
He's telling you head on, he's now going to tell you about the founding of a church in its existential meaning.

179
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:13,320
Never, nothing magical is going to happen, but something very important is going to happen.

180
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,760
And how does it work?

181
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:25,080
Well, the last pages show you how it works, or in a certain sense, Alyasha produces it, makes it work.

182
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:32,360
He produces a religious community at the burial.

183
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:34,360
So let's go to that.

184
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:37,319
He's talking on the very important speech.

185
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,320
Dostoevsky packs a lot into it on 727.

186
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:50,440
He says, There's Alicia's stone under which they wanted to bury him.

187
00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:53,000
They all stood by the big stone.

188
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,320
And then he makes the speech: Boys, we shall soon part.

189
00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:00,919
I shall be for some time with my two brothers, one of whom is going to Siberia.

190
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,760
The other is lying at death's door.

191
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,639
That's where we know.

192
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:04,840
I never noticed that before.

193
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,279
I knew Yvonne was dying.

194
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:15,559
We were told that he looked like a dying man when he testified in court, but I hadn't really realized that he is dying.

195
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:16,439
Of course, he doesn't die.

196
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,679
I read you the passage last time, that he's lying at death's door.

197
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:27,719
He's certainly the kind of crucifixion that doesn't give you new life, resurrection.

198
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,240
And I don't know what saves him, but he's just barely saved.

199
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,359
But okay, he says, soon I shall leave town for a long time, so we shall part.

200
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:43,480
Let us make a compact here at Alysa's stone that we will never forget Alyusha and one another.

201
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:54,480
And whatever happens to us, and now there's a whole long speech that's important, in later life, even if we don't meet for 20 years, let's remember how we buried the poor boy at whom we once threw stones.

202
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,359
Then he talks more about all that and at the top of 728.

203
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:02,000
And we will remember him, boys, all our lives.

204
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:13,839
And even if we are occupied with important things, even if we attain honor and fall into or fall into misfortune, let us remember how good it was once here when we were all together, united by good and kind feelings.

205
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,679
Now, what's he doing?

206
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,439
You recognize something from very early in the book, coming back.

207
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,919
And again, Dostieski is so clear.

208
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,000
He tells you it's coming back.

209
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:26,639
Exactly.

210
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,960
He's creating a childhood memory.

211
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:41,440
He's creating a shared memory, which is going to be something that will remain the same meaning for them all through their lives.

212
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,279
So there are skipping a little.

213
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:50,799
You must know there is nothing higher and stronger and more wholesome and good in life in the future than some good memory, especially a memory of childhood.

214
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,960
He's telling you.

215
00:18:53,279 --> 00:19:03,039
People talk to you a great deal about your education, but some good sacred memory, we'll talk in a minute why it's sacred, preserved from childhood is perhaps the best education.

216
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,000
If a man carries many such memories into life, he's saved to the end of his days.

217
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,480
Now, why is it sacred?

218
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:14,880
What's its relation to the other moments of time?

219
00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:17,839
Remember when we discussed it way back in Kierkegaard already?

220
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:22,639
It's the same thing as the Augenblich, the instant in Kierkegaard.

221
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,880
That's a sacred moment.

222
00:19:24,879 --> 00:19:25,359
Yeah.

223
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,760
It's eternity and time.

224
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,079
Right.

225
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:30,039
Oh, you're all on the good things today.

226
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:30,279
Right.

227
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:47,880
And to say it's eternity in time means that, whereas usually, remember I drew that on the board, it's so important to Dostoevsky and to Kierkegaard that there are these moments and they are constantly giving giving a significance and then you retroactively change the significance.

228
00:19:47,879 --> 00:19:59,559
When something bad happens, you come here, it's great, then something bad happens to you here, and you retroactively think it was a disaster that you came here, and then by the time you graduate, you think you had a wonderful four years.

229
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:04,439
But you can go on redefining your experience forever.

230
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,279
Well, forever is the wrong thing to say.

231
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:07,639
Constantly.

232
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,960
But if you have one of these super experiences, they don't get redefined.

233
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,079
They help you redefine everything else.

234
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:21,480
No matter what happens to you, it never will get redefined if this works.

235
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:36,519
That you had this memory, that you were once good and pure and loving and loved Alicia and Alicia loves you, no matter what temptations you face, no matter what terrible mistakes you make, you'll never be reinterpreting that experience.

236
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:39,720
It will reinterpret all your other experiences.

237
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,319
Let me just read a little more.

238
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:50,519
Together at this stone, the cruelest and most mocking of us, if we do become so, will not dare to laugh at having been kind and good at this moment.

239
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:57,879
Interestingly enough, Nietzsche defines the sacred as something at which you don't dare to laugh.

240
00:20:57,879 --> 00:21:03,000
And that this is it's it's total seriousness this this moment.

241
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:09,960
What's more, perhaps than one memory that one memory may keep us from great evil, and so forth.

242
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,760
We'll reflect and say, Yes, I was good and brave and honest then, and so forth.

243
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:32,879
And now he begins to turn it into eternity in time on the top of 729, where he says, about 10 lines down, may his memory, see, he's now saying, Alicia, the good boy, the dear boy, precious to us forever.

244
00:21:32,879 --> 00:21:34,400
Let us never forget him.

245
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,279
May his memory live in our hearts, forever in our hearts.

246
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:45,440
Now, remember that forever is the name in Dostoevsky for eternity and time.

247
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,960
It means existentialized eternity.

248
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:56,240
It means not some kind of eternity like in Plato with the number two is numbers are eternal.

249
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,799
And then the fact that triangles have 180 degrees is eternal.

250
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,200
This is a kind of existential eternal.

251
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,639
It's true for your whole life, from the past and to the end of your life.

252
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,319
And so, forever is his name for the sacred, and it's his name.

253
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:18,000
Name for the eternal.

254
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:21,760
So, may his memory live forever in our hearts.

255
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,839
Yes, yes, forever, the boys cried in their ringing voices.

256
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:28,879
Now, you notice something happening there.

257
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:31,679
This sort of he says this, and then they echo it.

258
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,960
We remember that he will, we'll always remember, cried the boys.

259
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,159
He was brave, he was good, how we loved him, and so forth.

260
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,599
And now, that's just to sort of make it like a church service.

261
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:47,919
I mean, Alyasha makes these claims, and then the boys echo them.

262
00:22:48,960 --> 00:23:05,559
And the whole thing defines them as a community defined by this experience, the sacred experience of having discovered, having formed this sacred memory together over the death of Ilusha.

263
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:20,440
And so, and then skipping down, but now we need to know what's this guy, have we now existentialized what happens to people after they die, immortality, and so forth?

264
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,879
And there, the answer is really interesting and strange, about two-thirds of the way down.

265
00:23:25,879 --> 00:23:27,560
Forever, the boys chimed in.

266
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:34,920
Well, and may the dear boy's memory live forever, said Alyasha again, at it again with feelings, forever the boys chimed in again.

267
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,199
This is the chorus.

268
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:47,559
And then Akalia says, Karamatsov, can it be true, as they teach us in church, that we shall all rise again from the dead and shall live and see each other again, all Ilusha too?

269
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:50,039
Now, what do you make of that?

270
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:52,839
That's a tough one for Alyasha.

271
00:23:52,839 --> 00:24:09,799
He's given them an existentialized story that it's already forever true that they will always be together forever and with Ilusha together forever, in the sense that this experience is sacred and nothing will change it.

272
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:14,919
Can he promise them that they'll meet in the afterlife and be happily together?

273
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,120
No, he can't do that.

274
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,799
He doesn't know that.

275
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:24,119
Physics and chemistry don't tell him that there can't be the afterlife for the soul.

276
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:26,359
And physics and chemistry, it better not.

277
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:32,120
But neither can religion tell him that there will be an afterlife for the soul.

278
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:38,839
I mean, it's beyond physics and chemistry, and it's beyond existentialist existentializing.

279
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:48,879
The only thing he can existentialize is that at least in this life, there is a kind of immortality, a kind of eternity that's possible.

280
00:24:48,879 --> 00:24:50,720
So let me see now.

281
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,160
Let me get where we are.

282
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,039
Okay, they've been changed forever.

283
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,359
They've got eternity and time.

284
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:09,920
Now, what they've got is they'll be with each other in Alyusha forever.

285
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,839
That's all you can say.

286
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:15,279
But let me just frame it for what you can't say.

287
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:24,480
I mean, physics and chemistry can't say anything, but neither can the Greek Orthodox Christianity of Dostoevsky say anything.

288
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:40,400
Zosima says things, but that's because Zosima is still sort of half inside the magical side of Christianity, the belief in a kind of Plato-like God and so forth.

289
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:50,480
And belief just mainly in the sort of either he takes the Christian story literally or he uses it literally to help people.

290
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,439
I don't know which.

291
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:59,599
But there's an interesting moment way back on 58 where the peasant woman comes in whose child has died.

292
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,760
You remember what Zosima does?

293
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,119
Tells her?

294
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,880
No reason why you should.

295
00:26:04,879 --> 00:26:06,880
A million events have happened in the meantime.

296
00:26:06,879 --> 00:26:08,079
You do remember.

297
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,720
Yes, you remember that.

298
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,839
Amazing.

299
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:12,799
Okay, right.

300
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:25,519
He tells her at the bottom of 58 that your son is one of the angels of God, and he looks down from there at you and sees you and rejoices in your tears and points them out to the Lord God.

301
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:31,720
Well, according to Dostoevsky, there's no way that Zosima could know that, that anybody could know that.

302
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:36,039
There's just nothing we know about what happens after people die.

303
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:50,279
And Dostoevsky thinks that if you've existentialized the forever and made life meaningful for people in a community around a loving event, that's all they need in this life.

304
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:53,960
So then what happens is very peculiar.

305
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,320
And I'm putting my kind of spin on it.

306
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:59,240
It could be completely wrong.

307
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,480
You have to decide for yourself.

308
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:15,480
On 7:29, what happens next is, after Kalya asks the question, Alyasha's response is really strange.

309
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,480
Certainly we shall all rise again.

310
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:22,679
Certainly we shall see each other and shall tell each other with joy and gladness all that has happened.

311
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:27,319
Alyasha answered half laughing, half enthusiastic.

312
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,000
Now, I don't know what that.

313
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,599
I mean, you can say, wow, look at that.

314
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:31,720
He's like Zosima.

315
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:39,639
He believes that we're all going to live forever in some other heavenly world and look down on this one and meet each other again.

316
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,320
But there's something funny about him telling it, half laughing.

317
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:51,399
Let me say, and then you could say, I read it as, look, I told you all you need to know about eternity and forever.

318
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,079
You and Alicia and each other are together forever.

319
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,760
What more do you want to know?

320
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,319
But, of course, you can put it that way if you want to.

321
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,680
But he doesn't go into it.

322
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,519
He doesn't make a big fuss about it.

323
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:03,799
He drops it.

324
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:06,039
Kalya says, How wonderful.

325
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:08,679
And he says, Let's go eat some pancakes.

326
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:14,959
And right after that, he says, well, now we finish talking and go to the funeral dinner and so forth.

327
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,720
Don't be disturbed at our eating pancakes.

328
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:20,159
It's an old custom and something, there's something nice in that.

329
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:31,760
Now, but I mean, if you want to say that all of a sudden Alyosha sounds like Zosima and believes in the afterlife, there's nothing that Dostoevsky's got in here that prevents you from saying it.

330
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,879
But I don't think you should think that Dostoevsky is telling you that somehow that he knows that.

331
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:38,319
You want to say something?

332
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:39,119
Yeah.

333
00:28:44,879 --> 00:28:50,559
Well, instead of enthusiastic, ecstatic, how will it help us one way or the other?

334
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:55,039
Like what?

335
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:58,720
Yeah, I think it's the same for this purpose.

336
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,279
He's really, really happy.

337
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:08,720
And he's very happy about the fact that he's now established the, so to speak, immortality of this love.

338
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:16,560
But I don't think we are supposed to conclude that he's now established that they're really going to meet again in the afterlife.

339
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,120
It would be just, it doesn't fit with the rest of the book.

340
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:24,639
I mean, he has never made any claims based on revelation, ever.

341
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:37,679
He only makes claims based on faith phenomenology, that is, these existential experiences of childhood memories, of confession, of what else, there's so many, of miracles and so forth.

342
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,279
But those never, he never cites the Bible when he does it.

343
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,799
He just says, look, these experiences exist.

344
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,800
But he can't say, look, experiences of the afterlife exist.

345
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,879
We've heard lots of reports about that.

346
00:29:50,879 --> 00:30:01,400
So I think he's saying, look, I think it's a funny way of always, remember, whenever he does anything, he always gives you this hit over the head.

347
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,680
Look, I just did a miracle, you'll say, with Grushenka.

348
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:09,159
And I think what he's saying is, look, I just existentialized the afterlife.

349
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,000
That's what he's doing there.

350
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:25,159
He's bringing, otherwise, people might miss that this whole story about the forever is meant to be all that we can ever know existentially about whether there's an afterlife or not.

351
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,839
And it's enough.

352
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:32,439
If you understood this, you wouldn't be in this kind of despairing upsetness that Mrs.

353
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,480
Holokoff and old Karamatso mean.

354
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:37,480
Anyway, that's my reading of it.

355
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:45,399
But I admit, you have to bring your whole understanding of the book to bear on that sentence to know what it means.

356
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,159
Okay, so anybody want to say anything about that?

357
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:50,839
Yeah.

358
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:07,639
No, I think, as the Catholics in the class know and have come and told me at office hours, it looks like a reference to the Euther.

359
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:09,559
What?

360
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:10,279
I can't say it.

361
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:11,000
I can't get it.

362
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,799
Euther.

363
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:12,279
I can't say it.

364
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:13,319
Well, never mind.

365
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:14,120
Somebody say it.

366
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:14,679
Eucharist.

367
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,399
I got it.

368
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:15,960
Okay.

369
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:24,200
That is, I mean, it's the eating of the bread and the drinking of the wine, I think, probably.

370
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,679
And then it's just another piece of the hitting you over the head, I've created a church.

371
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:30,199
We've got a church service.

372
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,240
We've got 12 people.

373
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,360
We're at a rock.

374
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,559
We're eating the blood.

375
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:36,359
Well, we're eating the body and not the blood, it turns out.

376
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:42,679
But we're taking part in this special kind of communion with the lived.

377
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:52,320
He can't say anything further because he's not going to say that they are eating the blood and body of Markle, who is the Christ figure in the book.

378
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:56,319
That's too weird for Dostoevsky to existentialize.

379
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,720
I can even say one more thing about it.

380
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:06,640
Not about the pancakes directly, but there's a funny thing going on here, which I never understood, and which maybe I don't understand now.

381
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:14,240
I mean, I tell you these things that I don't know for sure because sometimes people come in and tell me in office hours better ways of understanding it.

382
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,960
Why do you suppose there's a fuss being made?

383
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:27,039
That although Alysa wanted to be buried at the stone, the father says and gets very upset about that they're burying him in the churchyard, in the graveyard instead.

384
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:29,519
Why shouldn't they bury him at the stone?

385
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:40,240
Why shouldn't they, after all, there are martyrs buried under the cathedrals, and you might think that the best way to found a church is to found it on a martyr?

386
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,240
And Alysha died not really for love, but he died full of love.

387
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,519
And in a way, it was his brain fever that made him so loving.

388
00:32:49,519 --> 00:33:00,879
That's always the way it looks with Dostoevsky, because you have to be crazy to get out of being the selfish, natural being human beings are.

389
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,359
So why not bury him under the stone?

390
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:08,400
Well, after thinking about it a while, and I think that can't be an accident.

391
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,640
Dostoevsky goes out of his way.

392
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,199
Should we read it just to show you where it is?

393
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,919
There's a big fuss at that point about the stone.

394
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,159
If anybody finds it, let me know.

395
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,919
It ought to be on 724, 725 somewhere when they're carrying the body.

396
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:32,919
723 bottom.

397
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:34,519
Oh, yeah.

398
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:36,199
Well, no, I don't see it yet.

399
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,240
I don't want to ask.

400
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:39,240
Yes, I see it now about eight lines from the bottom.

401
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,639
I don't want him to be buried in the courtyard, the captain wails suddenly.

402
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,360
I'll bury him by the stone, by our stone.

403
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:49,639
Alicia told me I won't let him be carried away.

404
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:52,119
And he's been saying that for three days.

405
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:57,799
What an idea to bury him by a holy stone, says the landlady.

406
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:03,559
And the landlady prevails, and they don't bury him by the stone.

407
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:04,760
Well, there's that big fuss.

408
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,879
What's going on?

409
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:23,000
Well, I think Dostoevsky wants to separate, again, the kind of masochistic emphasis on death and suffering that you might find in a kind of Christianity he doesn't like from the kind that he does.

410
00:34:22,999 --> 00:34:31,160
So I think he wants to put the emphasis, purely, on the church founded on form by love.

411
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:37,640
And he wants to put the, he could have founded the church on the crucifixion, on the death.

412
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:42,520
He wants to found the church on the incarnation where love comes into the world.

413
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:50,360
And he wants to say what's crucial is the incarnation and whether there's a martyr and whether there's death involved in the founding of the church is accidental.

414
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:59,319
It's not something he intends to existentialize as part of the necessary structure of the church that it be based on death and suffering.

415
00:34:59,319 --> 00:35:09,319
I think, because he does seem to want to say, put the I'll I'll start with Alicia's stone, but then I want Alicia out of the story, and that is his death out of the story.

416
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:18,319
Remember, there's plenty of talk about Alicia at the stone and his love and how they all loved him, and he all loved them, and there's no talk about the fact that he died.

417
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:20,720
Okay, that's what I think.

418
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:38,240
But I it isn't important, it's but it's a well, they're always, this book is complicated enough and deep enough, there's always things that are very mysterious, and maybe Dostoevsky is always so clear and so sure of what he thinks that there may be some place where he says something about it.

419
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:40,480
Okay, anything about that?

420
00:35:40,479 --> 00:35:46,640
There's still more things to cover, so I think I should go on and do them.

421
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,160
Unless anybody has any objection.

422
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,760
We have time, but I'm ready to, yeah.

423
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,399
That sounds good.

424
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,960
I think that makes sense.

425
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:24,400
That's good.

426
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:25,839
Yeah, that's too sudden.

427
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:28,400
That's unholy, as the landlady says.

428
00:36:28,399 --> 00:36:40,319
People aren't ready to take over the existentialized side and drop the traditional second stage Christianity where there's a special holy place to bury people and so forth.

429
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:45,840
I think Dostoevsky thinks that's unnecessary, and in the third stage, we'll get beyond it.

430
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:46,879
But I think you're right.

431
00:36:46,879 --> 00:37:03,160
I think he's just sensible enough to think that you don't suddenly throw people into, you throw these religious people into an existentialized, post-institutional kind of Christianity yet.

432
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:03,880
Good.

433
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:05,720
That sounds plausible.

434
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,959
Okay, let's go through the last move.

435
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:10,760
There's still something, two things to do.

436
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:15,080
It's just amazing how, and I say he does so many things in the last book.

437
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:15,959
Okay.

438
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:28,279
All through the book now, we've got to do what, remember the next question is: what does it really mean to be a Karamatsov?

439
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:32,119
Because in some way, everybody in the book is a Karamatsov.

440
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,279
In some way, we're all Karamatsovs.

441
00:37:34,279 --> 00:37:36,440
They're just more extreme cases of it.

442
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:41,239
And that is to be a human self is to be a Karamatsov.

443
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,999
And what is it to be a human self?

444
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:46,200
Well, Dostoevsky still hasn't sorted that out.

445
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,720
He's purposely made it rather confusing.

446
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,840
And he's not going to sort it out till the very end.

447
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:54,359
But I've been hinting at it.

448
00:37:54,359 --> 00:38:02,760
But let's go back and look at the various things that you've heard about the Karamatsovs in the course of the book, starting on 2:15.

449
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,840
The third sentence.

450
00:38:08,839 --> 00:38:11,479
My brothers are destroying themselves, he went on.

451
00:38:11,479 --> 00:38:12,760
This is Alyasha.

452
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,479
My father, too, and they're destroying others with them.

453
00:38:15,479 --> 00:38:18,119
It's the primitive force of the Karamatsovs.

454
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:23,240
As Father Paisley said the other day, a crude, unbridled, earthly force.

455
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,440
Does the spirit of God move above that force?

456
00:38:26,439 --> 00:38:28,120
Even that I don't know.

457
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,760
I only know I too am a Karamatsov.

458
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,600
Well, that is pretty hard on the Karamatsovs.

459
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,200
And is that the final story about it?

460
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:47,360
That would seem to say that the self has a dark side, and the dark side is prominent in people like the Karamatsovs anyway.

461
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:53,599
And that maybe everybody is really sinful, and the dark side is prominent.

462
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,680
It looks pretty bleak.

463
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,319
And they said when...

464
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:10,000
And so being a Karamatsov is the side of the self that is base in Dmitry terms, and that we're too broad to ever get an equilibrium.

465
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:12,880
And this is on 660.

466
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:17,520
Next time it comes around that I know of, it probably comes around other times too.

467
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,360
Now this is the prosecutor.

468
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:29,760
Now the prosecutor, the whole trial, is, and I could, I have time to say a word about the trial, so why don't I take a parenthesis, but then we'll get to the prosecutor.

469
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,560
The trial is a kind of big joke from Dostoevsky's point of view.

470
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:47,760
A joke in the sense that it's a bunch of psychological arguments about whether Dmitry committed this crime or not, whether he could have committed, whether he's the kind of person who could have committed this crime.

471
00:39:47,760 --> 00:40:04,319
It's all an attempt to understand people's motives, but a very superficial attempt, which he thinks what psychology is, as opposed to existential thinking, which he doesn't have a name for, but what he's doing, which he doesn't think is psychology.

472
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,919
Although he says on the back of this book or some translation that he considers himself a psychologist.

473
00:40:09,919 --> 00:40:11,920
I think that's the wrong way to put it.

474
00:40:11,919 --> 00:40:14,959
Because what are we going to call those people at the trial?

475
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:17,039
But anyway, remember the joke, for instance?

476
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,480
I haven't got it marked here because I didn't know I'd have time to talk about it.

477
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:31,639
That they have this fuss about when Dmitri walks in and they decide whether he, and he walks in looking straight ahead of himself, and then one of them, one of the prosecutors interprets that.

478
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,680
I don't know if you could find it.

479
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,720
Can anybody find it?

480
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:34,200
I doubt it.

481
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:48,279
Says that it's important to notice that he didn't look at the jury, and it was the jury who had his whole fate, and other ones say he looked at the other direction because that's where the women were, and he was sort of incorrigible, womanizer.

482
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:52,760
And they have all these theories about what direction he was looking for.

483
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,879
Can we find it?

484
00:40:53,879 --> 00:40:54,439
I don't know.

485
00:40:54,439 --> 00:40:55,240
Let's try.

486
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:01,560
Because it's my best example of the fact that he's making fun of the whole trial.

487
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:07,560
Of course, in effect, the whole trial is obviously a disaster because they get the wrong conclusion.

488
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,960
They sentence Dimitri as a murderer.

489
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,519
But let's see if we can find where they're arguing.

490
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:18,120
Help me find where they're arguing about which way Dimitri looked, because it's pretty funny.

491
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,680
685?

492
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,680
635?

493
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:44,200
Oh, yeah, there.

494
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,760
I have it marked around there.

495
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,599
Okay, so where are those?

496
00:41:48,919 --> 00:41:55,399
So, yeah, here we are.

497
00:41:56,279 --> 00:42:10,680
He's saying, as to my opinion, learned colleagues, I'm in the middle paragraph, the Moscow doctor added, ironically, in conclusion, that the prisoner would, on entering the court, have naturally looked at the ladies and not straight before him.

498
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,760
I will only say that apart from the playfulness of this theory, it is radically unsound.

499
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:24,080
Though I fully agree that the prisoner on entering the court, where his fate will be decided, would naturally look straight before him in that fixed way.

500
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,920
And that may really be a sign of his abnormal mental condition.

501
00:42:27,919 --> 00:42:40,240
At the same time, I maintain that he would naturally not look to the left at the ladies, but to the right to find his legal advisor, on whose help all his hopes rest, and on whose defense all his future depends.

502
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,560
The doctor expressed his opinion.

503
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:52,319
And then it goes on, but the unexpected pronouncements of doctors, whatever his name is, gave the last touch of comedy to the difference of opinion between the experts.

504
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,599
So it's a comedy.

505
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,799
And what they all miss, and why are they all wrong?

506
00:42:58,799 --> 00:43:01,999
Why is psychology all wrong, according to Dostoevsky?

507
00:43:01,999 --> 00:43:11,919
I think it's because they are all operating within a certain conception of human nature, which is roughly that people are selfish and looking out for their own interests.

508
00:43:11,919 --> 00:43:22,160
They're trying to find out what interest Dimitri is looking out for when he walks into the courtroom, but they're asking which selfish motive is he following.

509
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,440
And the really important question about people is how they can be transformed.

510
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:39,040
That they have no clue, any of these people, in the trial, the judicial system, that people can be reborn and become, that they are indeed all sinful.

511
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,080
That psychology is a study of sinful people.

512
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:47,599
But what's interesting is existential something or other, as I say, Dostoevsky has no name for it.

513
00:43:47,760 --> 00:44:04,120
Let's call it existentializing, which is interested in the things that happen that enable people to be reborn, like the mysterious visitor who confesses, like Rushenko, when she's looked at by Alyasha, like childhood memories.

514
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:10,760
Everything that's important, psychology knows nothing about, because that's all in a sacred dimension.

515
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,920
Psychology is sort of the physics and chemistry of the soul.

516
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:21,480
But they've got it all wrong, because the physics and chemistry of the soul just doesn't get at what's important about the soul.

517
00:44:21,479 --> 00:44:34,200
I think that's, I just tell you why, in fact, you had to go through all this theoretical nonsense, is because Dostoevsky has something there, a chip on his shoulder, he wants to bring out.

518
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,959
But now, that was an aside.

519
00:44:35,959 --> 00:44:38,680
We're back here to the prosecutor.

520
00:44:38,999 --> 00:44:43,880
It wasn't a useless aside, because the prosecutor is obviously going to be wrong.

521
00:44:43,879 --> 00:44:47,079
So here's a wrong view of the Karamatsavs.

522
00:44:47,399 --> 00:44:49,240
The first story is wrong.

523
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:57,559
Alyasha's early view, at least let's hope it's wrong, that to be a Karamatsov is to be base and selfish and awful.

524
00:44:57,879 --> 00:45:04,200
And now we get one in the middle of 60, which is closer, because he was the broad Taramatsov character.

525
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,079
This is Dmitry.

526
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,760
That's just what I'm leading up to.

527
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:12,760
Capable of combining the most incongruous contradictions and capable of the greatest heights and the greatest depths.

528
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:18,760
Remember the brilliant remark made by the young observer who was seeing the Karamatsov family at close quarters, Mr.

529
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,720
Rakitin.

530
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:26,840
And you should begin to wonder whether this guy who thinks that Rakitin got the brilliant last word could have it right.

531
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:28,359
But it's not terribly wrong.

532
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:36,520
The sense of their own degradation is as essential to these reckless, unbridled natures as the sense of their generosity.

533
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,239
And that's true, the prosecutor says.

534
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:47,760
They need continually this unnatural mixture, two extremes at the same moment, or they are miserable and dissatisfied, and their existence is incomplete.

535
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:52,640
They are wide, wide as Mother Russia, and they include everything and put up with everything.

536
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,720
Well, it's somehow so almost right and so mixed up.

537
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,200
They need this unnatural mixture.

538
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,319
Well, Dimitri doesn't want the unnatural mixture.

539
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,600
For one thing, it's a natural mixture.

540
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:09,520
They have impulses both good and bad.

541
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:13,120
But they don't need and want to have impulses both good and bad.

542
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:16,720
They want to be able to get them together in some positive way.

543
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,720
That's Dimitri's whole hope.

544
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:30,319
And he's in the despair of negative R2 because he can't get the dark side and the light side, the base side, and the noble side together.

545
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:34,080
And so they have these contradictions.

546
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:47,600
But the point is, for Dostoevsky, the question is: is there a way of taking a stand on these contradictions which make them not be unnatural and not be bad?

547
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,880
And of course, the secular can't deal with that.

548
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,520
But of course, the sacred can deal with that.

549
00:46:53,760 --> 00:47:03,520
There ought to be a way, there must be a way in the book to transform the Taramatsav into something positive and good.

550
00:47:05,279 --> 00:47:11,919
That's what the whole saving story is about, and all of us as Taramatsavs.

551
00:47:11,919 --> 00:47:14,239
And of course, that is what's happening.

552
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:21,120
What Rakitin is describing is what the self is like before it's transformed by love.

553
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:25,279
It's what Dmitri is sort of like at the beginning of the book.

554
00:47:25,279 --> 00:47:36,040
Then there's a side which is base, sensual, involved, impulsive, and but that's taken as something negative.

555
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:42,440
But there's something okay about being sensual, involved, impulsive.

556
00:47:42,439 --> 00:47:45,000
In fact, it's absolutely essential.

557
00:47:44,999 --> 00:47:50,760
Because if you aren't impulsive and involved, you can't ever do anything good.

558
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,879
Remember what happens?

559
00:47:52,520 --> 00:48:00,279
Another way to describe the split in the self is the split between the philosophical, detached, rational side.

560
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:05,080
No, wait, woo-woo-woo, not the way to put it.

561
00:48:07,959 --> 00:48:12,360
From the detached, rational side, you can see this in Yvonne.

562
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:19,560
The impulsive, involved, sensual side looks like the dark side.

563
00:48:19,879 --> 00:48:33,080
But from Dostoevsky's point of view, it's just as important, maybe more important, to be sensual, involved, impulsive, have the recklessness of the Karamatsov as it's described in my opinion.

564
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:37,639
One of those speeches I just read, I think, if not there, somewhere.

565
00:48:37,959 --> 00:48:45,240
It's important to have that, because it's with that kind of impulsive recklessness that people show their kind of love.

566
00:48:45,879 --> 00:48:51,159
Otherwise, they get reflective and self-protective and selfish and like Yvonne.

567
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:51,799
Yeah.

568
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:55,559
Wait, I can't hear you.

569
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,439
You've got to talk loud.

570
00:48:56,439 --> 00:48:57,319
Okay.

571
00:49:03,959 --> 00:49:04,439
I can't.

572
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,519
Somebody repeat what you're saying.

573
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,599
Oh, you come up here, I'll go over there.

574
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,399
Uh you've got to be really close to me for me.

575
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,519
Hear you, here.

576
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,200
Okay, now, tell me.

577
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:24,160
So do you think that's why the pigeon said tells Dimitri that he's a child and that you can be staying up in the morning?

578
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:27,279
Who tells him that he's like a child, Dimitri?

579
00:49:30,799 --> 00:49:31,359
Huh?

580
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:33,200
They tell uh who says he's like a child?

581
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:33,919
I don't remember that.

582
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:35,920
Tell us about it.

583
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:36,719
Okay.

584
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:37,680
Go ahead.

585
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:50,640
Suppose, let's say that Dimitri is like a child, in the sense that he's completely impulsive and goes after both the good with all his might, and then he goes after the sodom side, sensuality with all his might.

586
00:49:50,959 --> 00:49:58,880
He's just totally involved and unreflective and unrational most of the time.

587
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,120
Well, okay, while you're looking, I'll...

588
00:50:01,279 --> 00:50:01,999
No, I'm...

589
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:02,640
Oh, you got it.

590
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,520
Perfect.

591
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,880
Okay, we're on page 396.

592
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,200
The peasant is talking.

593
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,039
I don't even know where we are, but let me start reading.

594
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:18,960
So you see, sir, who it is hell's for, said Andrew, whipping up the left horse.

595
00:50:18,959 --> 00:50:20,479
But you're like a little child.

596
00:50:20,479 --> 00:50:22,160
He's talking to Dimitri?

597
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:22,799
Ah, yeah.

598
00:50:22,799 --> 00:50:24,319
You're like a little child.

599
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:25,120
What?

600
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,279
Ah, now I see where we are.

601
00:50:29,279 --> 00:50:31,599
Yes, that's how we look on you.

602
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:35,680
And though you're quick-tempered, sir, yet God will forgive you for your kind heart.

603
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,279
That's a very important quote.

604
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,200
And you, do you forgive me?

605
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,559
Okay, yeah, do you forgive me?

606
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,519
Yes, he says.

607
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,639
You've never done me any harm.

608
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,479
No, for everyone, for everyone.

609
00:50:46,479 --> 00:50:47,680
You here alone on the road.

610
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,520
Will you forgive me for everyone?

611
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,920
And then that's one of his big things.

612
00:50:51,919 --> 00:50:53,600
But the important thing is I'm going to mark it.

613
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,880
396.

614
00:50:54,879 --> 00:51:03,799
Yeah, that's emphasizing the fact that there's something very positive to being impulsive and irrational.

615
00:51:03,799 --> 00:51:05,960
What's again 396?

616
00:51:06,279 --> 00:51:07,880
396.

617
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:15,719
Okay, so you begin to see that there are lots of different ways of interpreting the two sides of the Karamats.

618
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:20,040
You can see it as bad.

619
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:26,360
You can see it as impulsive, base, selfish, irrational.

620
00:51:26,359 --> 00:51:29,480
But you can also see the same thing as good.

621
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:38,359
But it only will become really good if it's transformed by love.

622
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,799
I mean, that's the important thing.

623
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,999
Dimitri's now got the self together.

624
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:50,920
He's not torn anymore now that he loves Grushenka and she's passed the love onto him that Alyasha passed on to her, presumably.

625
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:59,400
And that means that what's been called the earthy in an insulting sort of way is now something positive.

626
00:51:59,399 --> 00:52:07,399
And what seemed to be opposed to the lofty and spiritual now seems to be a component of the lofty and spiritual.

627
00:52:07,399 --> 00:52:11,720
So that you have to get one side is earthy and one side is heavenly.

628
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,440
And they both can be positive.

629
00:52:14,439 --> 00:52:18,120
And they both can be important and support each other.

630
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:23,240
And that's the kind of love of life that you need to have.

631
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:28,760
Even Ivan has it for a while, but he ends up, but he says he's going to lose it when he's 30.

632
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:32,519
And the recklessness of the Karamatsovs that I mentioned is 484.

633
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:36,120
I see that I wrote it down, so let me go look for it.

634
00:52:38,999 --> 00:52:44,559
Okay, and this is more about this kind of recklessness and how it's related to doing good things.

635
00:52:44,279 --> 00:52:48,399
On 484, about three-quarters of the way down, this is Dmitri.

636
00:52:48,479 --> 00:52:52,960
And he felt a passion of pity, such as he had never known before, was rising in his heart.

637
00:52:52,959 --> 00:52:54,959
And he wanted to do something for the babe.

638
00:52:54,959 --> 00:53:01,439
He wanted to do all this at once, regardless of obstacles, with the recklessness of the Karamatsov.

639
00:53:01,439 --> 00:53:07,360
But this recklessness can be a bad thing, but it could also be this very important good thing.

640
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:13,200
And as soon as you get in touch with the love of the universe, then the more reckless and impulsive, the better.

641
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:13,840
Yeah.

642
00:53:34,479 --> 00:53:36,400
He's 708.

643
00:53:43,439 --> 00:53:44,480
Huh.

644
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:50,079
Well, I think he wasn't.

645
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,760
I don't, I think you're misreading that.

646
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:52,559
Let's find it.

647
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:55,520
The way I heard it just now, we have to look at the context.

648
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:06,480
He doesn't want them to be able to take away his God, because if he didn't have God, he would rebel, because it's God that enables him to suffer and go to Siberia.

649
00:54:06,479 --> 00:54:08,319
Am I missing it?

650
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:11,279
Well, I don't know.

651
00:54:11,279 --> 00:54:12,880
We have to find the context.

652
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:14,480
Let's find it.

653
00:54:17,439 --> 00:54:19,200
Where is what he just said?

654
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,799
Okay, the hour of judgment has come.

655
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:24,640
I feel the hand of God upon me, and so forth and so forth.

656
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,399
I repeat that I'm innocent.

657
00:54:26,399 --> 00:54:28,080
I didn't kill him.

658
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:35,000
But I lived like a beast, and so forth and so forth.

659
00:54:35,319 --> 00:54:36,599
I don't believe the doctors.

660
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,279
I'm perfectly sane.

661
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,799
I'll pray for you.

662
00:54:39,799 --> 00:54:41,959
I'll be a better man and so forth.

663
00:54:41,959 --> 00:54:42,760
But spare me now.

664
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:43,079
Let's see.

665
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,279
I'll break my sword over my head.

666
00:54:44,279 --> 00:54:45,240
I'll kiss the pieces.

667
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:45,879
But spare me.

668
00:54:45,879 --> 00:54:47,880
Do not rob me of my God.

669
00:54:47,879 --> 00:54:48,839
I know myself.

670
00:54:48,839 --> 00:54:49,879
I shall rebel.

671
00:54:49,879 --> 00:54:50,760
My heart is heavy.

672
00:54:51,399 --> 00:54:55,400
Now, what would it be for them to rob him of his God?

673
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,039
I don't see how they can do that.

674
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,960
I don't really understand the passage.

675
00:54:59,959 --> 00:55:00,760
Help.

676
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:01,479
Yes.

677
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,400
How could they do that?

678
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:22,440
But he'll say, but well, yes, but they're going to, Bushenka's going to go to Siberia with them, and in Siberia he's going to be connected to all the prisoners.

679
00:55:22,439 --> 00:55:23,799
So I don't see how.

680
00:55:25,319 --> 00:55:30,840
All I can see is don't view me as a murderer.

681
00:55:30,839 --> 00:55:34,200
Because if I were a murderer, I would be, ah, that's one.

682
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,560
I would be disconnected from the connectedness.

683
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,120
Don't see me.

684
00:55:40,439 --> 00:55:41,879
I think I can't do better.

685
00:55:41,879 --> 00:55:45,079
I don't see how they can make him into a murderer.

686
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:55,559
But it's something like: if you condemn me, and if you make me into a murderer, then I would be out of the connectedness, I would lose God, and I would rebel against that.

687
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,640
In other words, I wouldn't let it happen.

688
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:05,799
I won't let it happen that you declare me a murderer that is outside of the connectedness that is unrelated to God.

689
00:56:05,799 --> 00:56:11,479
That's pretty good, given the weirdness of the passage, and I said I'd never thought about it before.

690
00:56:11,479 --> 00:56:13,840
I'm going to write it down and think about it some more.

691
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,399
But I think that's right, but it certainly is a strange thing.

692
00:56:13,479 --> 00:56:20,160
Do not rob me of my God.

693
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:22,000
I shall rebel.

694
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,040
I see.

695
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,439
Well, I think the answer is constantly.

696
00:56:35,439 --> 00:56:37,040
I'm beginning to understand it.

697
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:42,560
He never says he's willing to admit that he's a murderer because he isn't a murderer.

698
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:52,319
And he's saying, in effect, don't declare me outside of the loving connectedness because I couldn't stand it to live outside the loving connectedness.

699
00:56:52,319 --> 00:57:02,160
And so when he says to Alyasha that he wants to go to Siberia, he wants to go to Siberia because he desired the death of old Taramat.

700
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,400
So he's still feeling guilty for that.

701
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,799
He was tempted to go outside the connectedness and commit the murder.

702
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:12,559
But he keeps saying, but I didn't.

703
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,319
I'm not that kind of person.

704
00:57:14,479 --> 00:57:16,400
I would never do that.

705
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:19,440
And so he's saying both things, no?

706
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:33,360
Because he's condemned as a murderer.

707
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:36,319
Okay, but he's got this funny reservation.

708
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:40,399
I'm willing to go to Siberia because, I mean, this is what he's saying to the jury.

709
00:57:40,399 --> 00:57:41,199
You're helping.

710
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,680
He's saying, I'm willing to go to Siberia.

711
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,760
I don't mind your judgment.

712
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,480
But don't condemn me as a murderer.

713
00:57:48,479 --> 00:57:58,480
Condemn me as somebody who desired to kill his father, and I'll be glad to go because I need to suffer for what I did, desiring the death of my father.

714
00:57:58,479 --> 00:58:02,680
But don't tell me that I'm outside the connectedness and that I've killed my father.

715
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,760
I couldn't stand that.

716
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:06,520
That sounds right.

717
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:10,200
Okay, now we're back to that interesting quote.

718
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:10,519
Thanks.

719
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,960
We're learning things.

720
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:20,360
So now we're ready for the last, we're still talking about what it is to be a Karamatsov, but it's getting clear.

721
00:58:20,999 --> 00:58:31,480
The best thing you can do is get in touch with the love in the universe that will bring together the contradictions, which will then become reinforcing each other instead of destructive.

722
00:58:31,479 --> 00:58:37,960
And the way to understand it is: one side will be the earthly, and one side will be the heavenly.

723
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:45,799
When you see the two factors that way, you don't see that's the spiritual and the sensual.

724
00:58:45,799 --> 00:58:48,120
You don't see them as opposed.

725
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:52,680
And that's what you've learned in the course of the book, as far as Karamatsovs are concerned.

726
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,840
Now, let's go back to the boys.

727
00:58:54,839 --> 00:59:02,999
How, again, well, how does Dostoevsky tell you that finally the Karamatsov thing is a positive thing?

728
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,239
The more you're a Karamatsov, the better.

729
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:08,440
And the fact that we're all Karamatsovs is great.

730
00:59:08,439 --> 00:59:12,200
What he's doing in, and he does it on 729.

731
00:59:13,479 --> 00:59:18,279
Alyosha is still saying at the top: may his memory live forever in our hearts.

732
00:59:18,279 --> 00:59:20,200
Yes, yes, forever.

733
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:23,640
And then we get the part on eating the pancakes.

734
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,960
And now we're almost at the end of the book.

735
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,560
And what happens?

736
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,440
We're going to go hand in hand, he says.

737
00:59:30,439 --> 00:59:33,559
And all we sow, all our lives hand in hand.

738
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,080
That's still the forever.

739
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,359
Now comes the new thing.

740
00:59:36,359 --> 00:59:39,560
Hooray for Karamatsov, Kalya cried once more.

741
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:43,799
And once more the boys took up the cry: Hooray for Karamatsov.

742
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:52,239
So the last thing in the book is the cheer for the Karamatsov.

743
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:59,279
And it's just a subtle point that the other translation that I used last time was wrong.

744
00:59:59,279 --> 01:00:03,840
It says, it adds one more sentence that isn't in the book.

745
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:06,480
It says, hooray for Karamatsov.

746
01:00:06,479 --> 01:00:07,600
Oh, here.

747
01:00:07,919 --> 01:00:09,600
Yes, no, no, sorry.

748
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,559
And once more, the boy.

749
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:13,119
That would be stupid to say what I just said.

750
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:13,760
Take it back.

751
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,919
Cross out hooray for Karamatsov.

752
01:00:15,919 --> 01:00:17,360
I'm telling you the wrong story.

753
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:21,919
The right translation doesn't end with hooray for Karamatsov.

754
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:25,839
Dostoevsky's got so many balls in the air, he's got to keep track of all of them.

755
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:28,240
Yes, he wants to say hooray for Karamatsov.

756
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,279
He's got to do eternity, and that is immortality.

757
01:00:31,279 --> 01:00:33,120
He's got to get a church, he's done it.

758
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:37,600
He wants to get immortality, that is eternity and time, he's done it.

759
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:42,160
He wants to say, I've saved the Karamatsov's self and turned it into something positive.

760
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,119
He just did it.

761
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,200
Hooray for Karamatsov.

762
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:50,400
Now, why is the last sentence got to be, and it is in Russian.

763
01:00:50,399 --> 01:00:53,520
And once more the boys took up the cry.

764
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:56,000
What's the last issue?

765
01:00:55,999 --> 01:01:04,720
That the boys are going to go out into the world and that they are going to begin the transformation that will make the new star arise in the East.

766
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:08,799
It doesn't stop with Karamatsov.

767
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:09,999
It's just the start.

768
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:21,600
The picture Dostoevsky has is that all these boys will go out and they'll found their churches and they'll get people to love each other, and bit by bit, it will transform everybody, and they'll all love each other.

769
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:27,999
And so the end of the book is sort of he's sort of fulfilled his promise as best he can.

770
01:01:27,999 --> 01:01:44,600
He's given you a hint of how this kind of transformation in which the third possibility, namely the Russian Orthodox Church, demagicalized and existentialized, can transform everybody.

771
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:51,160
So that, remember, it isn't the church will become a state, but the state will become a church.

772
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:54,920
That's all in the boys took up the exclamation.

773
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:56,199
That's the promise.

774
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:59,639
That's what Dostoevsky wants all this to come out to be.

775
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,680
As far as I'm concerned, that's the end of the book.

776
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:03,959
There's not another sentence.

777
01:02:03,959 --> 01:02:06,680
In fact, there's one sentence, too many in this translation.

778
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:09,480
But anybody got anything to say about that?

779
01:02:10,439 --> 01:02:17,480
Well, I have other announcements I want to make, but I wanted to make sure we finished the book so you have everything in place when you're writing your papers.

780
01:02:17,479 --> 01:02:21,079
And unless anybody else has anything to say, we've done more than I hope.

781
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:25,080
We've got even some new quotes and new issues.

782
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:28,519
Okay, well, let me say, so now, that's done.

783
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,720
Let's, now important business.

784
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:38,999
One, just I want to repeat, don't forget, once you've got your paper handed in on Monday, you've got to leave some time to read.

785
01:02:39,319 --> 01:02:45,240
There isn't all that much reading in the Twilight of the Idols, because that's what we're going to discuss on Tuesday.

786
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,399
But now I want to talk about the exam.

787
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:52,040
You've got the time and places now of the two exams, the what I handed in.

788
01:02:52,040 --> 01:03:03,799
But I want to say something about, because people are asking about, the way we've changed from the paper to having an essay question.

789
01:03:03,799 --> 01:03:08,440
I want to describe the whole exam, and then so you can see what's going on.

790
01:03:08,439 --> 01:03:12,440
It was going to be a two-hour exam, and you were going to write a third paper.

791
01:03:12,439 --> 01:03:14,760
So, let me tell you first about the first two hours of the exam.

792
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:31,040
That's going to be quotes from the book, and you're being asked, so I'll tell you this again right before on the last day, but you're being asked to tell the significance of the, who says this in what book, which should be obvious, it's not tricky.

793
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,920
And what is the significance of the quote?

794
01:03:33,919 --> 01:03:36,319
That means why did we pick this?

795
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:41,680
Why is this an important quote in the book that reveals something important about what's going on in the book?

796
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:47,439
I'll give you some examples on the last day, so this doesn't sound so abstract.

797
01:03:47,439 --> 01:03:56,080
And you've got to do 10 out of 12 in two hours, which means about a blue book page quote, the ten quotes.

798
01:03:56,319 --> 01:04:01,279
And then you have another hour still, so it's a three-hour exam.

799
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:03,360
And that's the essay question.

800
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:14,240
Now, to make the essay question as much like a normal paper writing question, we're going to give you a list of possible questions beforehand.

801
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:17,919
You've probably had this in some other courses, some of you, maybe not freshmen.

802
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:19,279
We're not the only ones.

803
01:04:19,279 --> 01:04:20,799
It's not, we didn't invent this.

804
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:26,160
We're going to give you, you get a chance to think about the essay question.

805
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:29,520
And you get the chance to think about several essay questions.

806
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:37,680
And then we're going to choose one or two, probably two, and you get to write what you thought about those essay questions.

807
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:38,720
Any questions?

808
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:39,839
You're all looking puzzled.

809
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:41,279
Am I not being clear?

810
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:42,240
Yeah.

811
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,160
You'll write on one.

812
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,639
Yeah, you will give you we'll give you a choice.

813
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:59,960
I mean, now I'm going beyond what we've decided yet, but let's say we give you a choice of five questions to think about, of which we put two in the exam, of which you write about one.

814
01:05:00,839 --> 01:05:02,839
That, you understand that?

815
01:04:59,439 --> 01:05:03,480
Yeah.

816
01:05:07,799 --> 01:05:09,560
That's a good question.

817
01:05:12,359 --> 01:05:13,479
I guess the answer.

818
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,040
What do you think?

819
01:05:16,359 --> 01:05:17,400
They're against it.

820
01:05:17,879 --> 01:05:22,200
I think the problem isn't that you've got the book, but what else you might write in the book?

821
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,879
I mean, you could write in microprint.

822
01:05:23,879 --> 01:05:25,959
My daughter could write microprint.

823
01:05:25,959 --> 01:05:28,920
Your whole paper on the last page of the book.

824
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:31,639
So, no, you have to remember things.

825
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:36,839
That means you can't put in direct quotes, obviously, because you can't be expected to remember direct quotes.

826
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:41,480
That's the advantage of having the book, is people could put in direct quotes like in a paper.

827
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:42,839
I don't think we made up our minds.

828
01:05:42,839 --> 01:05:44,680
Remind me to discuss it when we're meeting.

829
01:05:44,919 --> 01:05:46,360
It's a good question.

830
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,760
I mean, I'm inclined to say you can have your book.

831
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:53,080
And if you want to write your paper in microprint, that's okay with me.

832
01:05:53,399 --> 01:05:55,319
But we'll see.

833
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:57,000
Anything else?

834
01:05:57,879 --> 01:06:02,760
Because there's one more question I know that's lurking in some of your minds, because somebody asked me this.

835
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,920
How much are we going to weight the exam?

836
01:06:05,799 --> 01:06:12,440
Before we said each paper was one-third, and the exam was, I mean, one-quarter, and the exam was one-quarter.

837
01:06:12,439 --> 01:06:17,400
We're going to have to weight the exam more now, because it's counting as the third paper.

838
01:06:17,399 --> 01:06:29,399
Or maybe the best thing we'd do is just to weight the third part of the exam more in weighting the whole exam in putting it in as one-third of the grade.

839
01:06:29,399 --> 01:06:30,760
We have to figure that out.

840
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:43,319
But in some way, now that we've put that extra weight on the exam, we're putting the third paper in it, we have to, as much as possible, treat it as if it had something to do with the third paper.

841
01:06:43,959 --> 01:06:46,319
Okay, anybody got any problems with any of that?

842
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:50,160
Because if you do, you should tell us, we'll think about it.

843
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:50,960
Not.

844
01:06:50,959 --> 01:06:51,920
Okay, then.

845
01:06:51,919 --> 01:06:52,479
Good.

846
01:06:52,479 --> 01:06:53,599
Write your papers.

847
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,240
See you next Tuesday.

848
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:01,760
No, wait, wait.

849
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,319
Here, a question that I guess I wasn't clear about.

850
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:15,279
The quotes on the exam will be from all the books, that is, from Kierkegaard, from the brothers, from all the various Nietzsche books.

851
01:07:15,279 --> 01:07:23,519
And then the essays, I wasn't clear about that, won't just be on the brothers, but will be comparing the brothers.

852
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,199
I mean, it won't be just on Nietzsche.

853
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:30,400
It'll be comparing Nietzsche to Kierkegaard or Dostoevsky on some issue.

854
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:37,119
And maybe for the quotes, they cannot have the books, but for the essay, there will be two books.

855
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:42,240
One blue book would be like the books, and the two one.

856
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:42,879
That's interesting.

857
01:07:42,879 --> 01:07:43,839
I'll have to think about that.

858
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:45,440
First, I'll turn this off.
