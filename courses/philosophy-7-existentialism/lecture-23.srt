00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,001
We're ready for a whole new unit, so to speak, or issue, which we haven't talked about much at all.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,321
And that's Dostoevsky's view of suffering.

3
00:00:02,321 --> 00:00:05,441
That's why I've given you out the suffering chart.

4
00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:14,480
Amazingly enough, it took me years to realize that Dostoevsky had an interesting view about suffering.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:29,920
And more peculiarly, I didn't realize, I don't know for how long anymore, for 10 years or something, that, of course, he's got to existentialize the crucifixion and the resurrection, not just the incarnation.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:40,641
And the Christian story, after all, it's a big deal that God became flesh in Jesus, but it's also a big deal that Jesus was crucified and then resurrected.

7
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:44,081
How many have seen the Patron movie?

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:52,961
Okay, well, it's a hot topic, not quite so hot this year as the previous year, but certainly there's a lot of suffering in the Christian story.

9
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:00,360
And of course, Dostoevsky's going to have to make sense of it in his existentializing way.

10
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,081
So from now on, we're going to hear about crucifixion and resurrection.

11
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:14,281
And of course, you will also hear when I tell you, and you'll see it yourself when you read it or if you've read it, that there are points when Dostoevsky just hits you over the head with it.

12
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:17,240
He's talking about crucifixion and resurrection.

13
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,400
How I could have missed it, I don't know.

14
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:31,641
A student, I'll dedicate this lecture to her named Pamela Minkler about 15 years ago wrote a paper saying, look, it's all this stuff about crucifixion and resurrection.

15
00:01:31,641 --> 00:01:32,761
And that's right.

16
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:34,201
So here we go.

17
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:39,480
There turns out to be two kinds of suffering, basically, for Dostoevsky.

18
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,761
One of them is what gets translated as lacerations.

19
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:44,921
I think that's not a very good translation.

20
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,400
Another translation says strains.

21
00:01:47,400 --> 00:02:01,480
I don't know what the Russian is, but it's clearly about a kind of self-torment that people can do, making themselves more and more miserable, brooding about what bad things have happened to them.

22
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:11,161
And then, and that's a kind of masochistic martyrdom kind of suffering that Dostoevsky has no sympathy with.

23
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:21,401
An extreme case of it is Father Faripon, who tortures himself and lives this miserable life because he thinks that's what he's supposed to do.

24
00:02:21,401 --> 00:02:35,801
Another example is Yvonne's story in the where the Grand Inquisitor said that he's born the cross and lived in the desert and eaten, lived on locusts, like and so forth.

25
00:02:35,801 --> 00:02:43,681
And there's lots of suffering that Katerina has and that Yvonne goes through.

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,481
They're all forms of the wrong kind of suffering, of this kind of self-torment.

27
00:02:50,480 --> 00:03:06,961
Now, Dostoevsky has an interesting way of arguing when it turns out that somebody, like in this case, you might think Nietzsche, though he hadn't read Nietzsche, but anybody could say, look at this miserable masochistic religion Christianity is.

28
00:03:06,961 --> 00:03:09,201
You've got all this talk about suffering.

29
00:03:09,201 --> 00:03:16,881
You've got a God that gets crucified and nailed to the cross, and then you've got all these martyrs that get burned and shot full of arrows.

30
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:23,601
And gruesome paintings of bleeding, headless martyrs and so forth.

31
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,481
What a sick religion this is.

32
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,961
And Dostoevsky, very interestingly, doesn't deny it.

33
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:40,481
He shows you what that masochistic strain is that is in Christianity in Farrapon, in the Grand Inquisitor, and so forth.

34
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,561
But he says that's not the right kind of suffering.

35
00:03:45,441 --> 00:03:51,921
That's not the kind of suffering that leads to joy.

36
00:03:51,921 --> 00:04:11,681
And Christianity is really about a different kind of suffering, a kind of suffering that doesn't isn't self-torture, but is sort of based on real problems for which people really ought to suffer and do suffer.

37
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:17,601
And if you suffer the right way, then you will be end up joyful.

38
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,001
You will be crucified, but you will also be resurrected.

39
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,481
Whereas the wrong kind of suffering, the laceration kind, I'm going to call it the torment kind.

40
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,241
I forget what I called it on the card.

41
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,281
Did I use the translation or call it what I call it?

42
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:45,241
He called it torment laceration dash on the far right.

43
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,681
Very sensible of me.

44
00:04:46,681 --> 00:04:50,840
Now, I split the difference with the translators.

45
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:59,801
So those people will be reborn, resurrected, and joyful.

46
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:07,321
And they're the existentialized, right kind of Christianity, according to Dostoevsky's thinking about it.

47
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,640
It's just a brilliant kind of argument.

48
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:22,920
If somebody points out something wrong with what you like, you could either deny it or defend it or admit that the best thing you could do is say, yeah, that's right, but that's not the whole story.

49
00:05:23,961 --> 00:05:29,241
That is one kind of strain in Christianity, but there's another, and the real one is this.

50
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:38,281
By making this distinction, you've managed to do justice to the phenomena and defend the existentialized view that you want to.

51
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,121
That's what Dostoevsky does.

52
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,401
He gives you both negative and positive suffering.

53
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:49,401
He gives you a detailed description and analysis of the motivations behind each.

54
00:05:49,401 --> 00:06:05,481
He shows you that one of them leads to joyful, life-affirming connectedness, and the other, the martyr kind, the masochistic kind, leads to suffering of a kind that leads to isolation and finally to death.

55
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:13,361
That leads to, and I think we'll get to that today, I expect to, a kind of crucifixion which doesn't lead to resurrection, you just die.

56
00:06:13,681 --> 00:06:20,321
And that's certainly a possibility.

57
00:06:20,321 --> 00:06:40,881
Now, and so we've so we've seen, just to review, the incarnation story, the existentializing of Jesus as the way God's love enters the world and shows up as something people can do.

58
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:49,600
You see it in Markle, coming from Markle to Zosima, and from Zosima to Alyasha, and from Alyasha, this love goes out into the world.

59
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:56,801
Now we're going to see how there is a kind of redeeming suffering, and it produces a new man.

60
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:14,241
And just as Alyasha is part of the incarnation story, sort of the culmination of the way the connectedness gets into the world, so you should know who's the main character who's going to demonstrate the right way to suffer.

61
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,921
You don't know.

62
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:18,161
I feel very unhappy.

63
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:19,521
Don't look at the chart.

64
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,121
That's cheating.

65
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,760
Well, I'm puzzled.

66
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,321
No, no, no, sorry.

67
00:07:28,321 --> 00:07:29,121
That's not what I mean.

68
00:07:29,441 --> 00:07:30,161
Maybe it's my question.

69
00:07:30,161 --> 00:07:30,961
It was stupid.

70
00:07:30,961 --> 00:07:33,041
Which character, which brother?

71
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:34,401
Ah, good.

72
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:35,521
It's my fault.

73
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,241
Yes, Dimitri demonstrates the right kind of suffering.

74
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:48,321
And remember that Zosima bows down to Dimitri and says he bows down to him for the great suffering in store for him.

75
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:52,321
Way early in the book already, it's clear that Dimitri is going to suffer.

76
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:54,840
He's got three things to suffer for.

77
00:07:55,161 --> 00:08:04,361
He's got to suffer because he's more upset by and tortured by the split self than any of the others.

78
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:13,321
That is, this problem of being both going for sodom and Madonna, being an insect and an angel.

79
00:08:13,321 --> 00:08:15,161
That's torturing him.

80
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:22,121
And then, lot wise, he has other things to torture him, desiring the death of his father.

81
00:08:22,441 --> 00:08:32,040
And then he gets, and this is where I think Dostoevsky is sort of murky and not too successful, but we'll have to look at it and talk about it.

82
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:39,881
Finally, he gets, Dimitri does, a kind of suffering, which is suffering for all of humanity.

83
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:48,921
And that's really the existentialized crucifixion.

84
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:51,880
And I don't understand it.

85
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,400
I'm not convinced by it.

86
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:55,881
And I'll show you where I'm not.

87
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,440
And maybe some of you will understand it and are.

88
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:06,120
You'll complete what Pamela Minkler almost taught me, where I can get a really positive grip on this story.

89
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,761
But we've got to get there little by little.

90
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:19,881
So, to begin with, Zostima distinguishes two kinds of suffering very early on already in the book.

91
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:25,561
They just get planted there, but Dostoevsky doesn't do much with them for quite a while.

92
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:41,041
So on page 57, he talks about a kind of suffering that just leads to worse and worse suffering at the top of the page, the first big paragraph, at the end of that paragraph, 57.

93
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,601
Here he calls it lamentations.

94
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,840
I don't know whether that's the same Russian word as the one for lacerations.

95
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,881
I doubt it.

96
00:09:52,880 --> 00:10:00,880
Because I think lamentations are, they're both people who suffer, lamentation people and laceration people.

97
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,160
But lamentation people have a real reason for suffering.

98
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,721
The example is the woman who's lost her child and she's in grief.

99
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,521
Whereas lacerations, it turns out, are a special product of pride.

100
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:23,921
I don't think the peasant woman shows pride, but she does have a kind of suffering that wallows in its own grief, and that's why it's like lacerations.

101
00:10:23,921 --> 00:10:28,321
And Zosima says, lamentations comfort only by lacerating the heart.

102
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,801
That is the same word.

103
00:10:30,801 --> 00:10:31,681
Still more.

104
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,921
Lacerating the heart still more.

105
00:10:33,921 --> 00:10:36,801
Such grief does not desire consolation.

106
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,561
See, that's what it has in common.

107
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,560
What, for instance, Katerina is doing.

108
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,720
Such grief does not desire consolation.

109
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,040
It feeds on the sense of its hopelessness.

110
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,841
Lamentations spring only from the constant craving to reopen the womb.

111
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:59,201
That's the woundishness is where the laceration and strain translation comes in.

112
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:03,921
But I think that self-torment is still closer.

113
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:05,441
Okay, that's one kind.

114
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:18,961
And then he talks about another kind of suffering on 51, no, not 51, 58, which at the very bottom, which leads to a kind of quiet joy instead of sort of wallowing in its grief.

115
00:11:18,961 --> 00:11:32,520
At the bottom, only every time that you weep, he says to the woman who lost her child, be sure to remember that your little son is one of the angels of God, that he looks down from there at you and rejoices at your tears and points them out to the Lord.

116
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:40,840
And then he goes on, a long while yet will you keep that great mother's grief, but it will turn into the end into quiet joy.

117
00:11:40,841 --> 00:11:46,921
See, you don't see that in Katerina or Yvonne or Father Farrakhan or any of these other people.

118
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:57,480
You turn into quiet joy, and your bitter tears will be the only tears, will be only tears of sorrow that purify the heart and deliver it from sin.

119
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:06,520
Well, that's nice because that's so one kind of suffering, if you get stuck in it and wallow in it, it just gets worse and worse.

120
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:28,280
Another kind, if you live it the right way with faith, it's Zosima's kind of faith, it's a kind of magical faith from Dostoevsky's point of view, that the child is still there looking down on the parents from heaven and looking at the mother and feeling glad that the mother is remembering the child.

121
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,961
That's too Zosima-like.

122
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:47,240
But if you can get an existentialized version of it, if you suffer in a way that keeps you open to God, which is namely the connectedness of you, it will turn into some kind of positive suffering.

123
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,800
You'll hear a lot more about that in a minute.

124
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,760
But there was one more thing.

125
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:58,360
Oh, yeah, I just noticed this time looking, reading the text, that I had something little thing I hadn't noticed before.

126
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,961
Maybe you all noticed it.

127
00:12:59,961 --> 00:13:02,840
Maybe it's not noticed anywhere else.

128
00:13:02,841 --> 00:13:07,240
But it turns out that the child who died is named Alexei.

129
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,760
That's Alyasha's nickname, right?

130
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,201
I think so.

131
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,801
And do we know that that means the man of God before that?

132
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,560
Does he say that anywhere else?

133
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,921
And that's nice.

134
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:20,801
See, what he says here is: what's the name of your child?

135
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,201
Alexei, Father, a sweet name after Alexei, the man of God.

136
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:36,161
I don't know whether that's a particular person or whether it means man of God, but it's the right name for Alyasha, and I just never noticed that he had that, what that name meant.

137
00:13:37,361 --> 00:13:40,800
So now, onward with this.

138
00:13:44,401 --> 00:13:56,961
The first question is: sort of, sure, there are kinds of suffering where something really bad has happened to somebody, like the mother whose child dies, but we want, those are extreme cases.

139
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:08,720
We want a story about why everyone must suffer, because we want to hear about some kind of way of making everyone's suffering into a source of joy.

140
00:14:09,601 --> 00:14:12,161
That's what we're going to get at the end.

141
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,480
So there's at least one way, and I've already mentioned it.

142
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:29,201
In Dimitri, one kind of suffering that everybody has is that the human self is a contradiction, and that until you get it together, you're going to be in despair and suffer.

143
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:36,480
So, and if you do get it together in the right way, then you get a kind of purification.

144
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:43,681
That is, the dark side becomes not a bad side, but a good side.

145
00:14:43,681 --> 00:14:47,761
It doesn't anymore be the insect and the lackey and so forth.

146
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,560
It's the earth, it's positive, it's sensuous, it's fruitful, and it turns into something positive.

147
00:14:55,881 --> 00:15:03,401
That's what happens when you finally are able to suffer it enough, look at it enough, and purify it.

148
00:15:03,401 --> 00:15:05,400
Remember, that's what Zosima says to Mrs.

149
00:15:05,401 --> 00:15:06,601
Holocaust.

150
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:15,961
So remember, too, that that's not like the Old Testament where you only suffer by expiating your actual crimes.

151
00:15:15,961 --> 00:15:35,720
But once you get an ethics that says you're responsible for your desires and your feelings, and you've got impurity by it, then you've got to purify them so that the dark, selfish side turns into something positive, which it does.

152
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:41,961
Remember, these factors in the self are different depending on how you understand them.

153
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:47,720
So you can understand this earthy side as this bad Karamatsov side.

154
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:55,961
You can also understand it as the warm, impulsive, loving, sensuous side, which is what happens.

155
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:58,520
That's what the purification does.

156
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:20,361
Now, and Dimitri is the great sufferer, starting, I presume, with the idea that no matter what he does, no matter what actions he performs, no matter what desires he has, even, he's a sufferer sort of all the way down because he's got this problem with the self.

157
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:25,641
I mentioned it, but I'll just remind you where it is on 81, two-thirds of the way down.

158
00:16:25,641 --> 00:16:33,400
You don't have to look at it, but that's where we get Zosima bowing so that his head touches the ground in front of Dimitri.

159
00:16:33,401 --> 00:16:45,600
And it's later on 486 that he explains why he bowed like that.

160
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,760
And he says, it's on 486, he says, it's for the great suffering in store for him.

161
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,840
About a third of the way down.

162
00:17:00,161 --> 00:17:01,600
Where is it?

163
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,841
That isn't where it is.

164
00:17:03,841 --> 00:17:04,400
Just a second.

165
00:17:04,401 --> 00:17:08,640
I gotta find 274.

166
00:17:08,641 --> 00:17:15,600
I just looked at the wrong place.

167
00:17:15,921 --> 00:17:24,961
So at the bottom, very bottom of 274, Zosima says, I bowed down yesterday to the great suffering in store for him.

168
00:17:25,601 --> 00:17:30,800
I think I better try.

169
00:17:30,961 --> 00:17:32,240
I know what I did to the mic.

170
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,040
Yeah.

171
00:17:37,601 --> 00:17:38,640
Try that.

172
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,240
You can still hear me, I hope.

173
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:41,760
I don't keep bumping into it.

174
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,201
Okay, so now.

175
00:17:43,841 --> 00:17:46,961
So he bows down to the great suffering in store for him.

176
00:17:46,961 --> 00:17:59,040
And then just because these kind of things happen in here, and you should keep your eyes open, remember, of course, Grushenka is the double or Dimitri.

177
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,441
And this comes out in two ways.

178
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:10,161
One, well, first, sorry, 486.

179
00:18:10,161 --> 00:18:15,040
Before I get to Grushenka, she since she's the double, we better get to him first.

180
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:26,441
So here's what, we're back on 486, where I jumped ahead, about a third of the way down, where Dimitri says, I accept the torture of accusation, my public shame.

181
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:29,560
I want to suffer because by suffering I'll be purified.

182
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:37,640
And then more, I accept my punishment, not because I killed him, but because I meant to kill him, and so forth.

183
00:18:37,641 --> 00:18:41,240
So he's suffering because he needs to be purified.

184
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,400
He's suffering because he has this particular bad desire.

185
00:18:45,401 --> 00:18:50,120
And later we'll see he's just suffering for all humanity some way or other.

186
00:18:50,121 --> 00:19:02,520
And now what's interesting is Grushenka, being a double of his, one, she makes the same kind of bow as Zasima to him when he says that at the top of 487.

187
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:06,520
It says Grushenka made a deep bow to Dmitri.

188
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,600
But that's not what's so interesting.

189
00:19:08,601 --> 00:19:19,161
Not only does she repeat the bow, but in a way that's a bit inscrutable, but you can see what Dostoevsky's trying to do, and he just asks you to believe it.

190
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:30,441
553, I say, but I don't believe it.

191
00:19:30,441 --> 00:19:31,880
That's not it.

192
00:19:32,201 --> 00:19:33,240
Hmm.

193
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,401
What could it be?

194
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,521
Every once in a while I just write down the wrong thing.

195
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,000
I doubt if anybody can just find it.

196
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,240
She's become a new woman.

197
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:50,520
As soon as Dimitri, let's go back to where we were.

198
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,800
As soon as Dmitri is, she bows down to him.

199
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,320
Maybe you'll find it.

200
00:19:55,321 --> 00:19:56,520
She, ah, there we are.

201
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,001
I don't know.

202
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,520
It's 533.

203
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,041
Okay, well, I wonder I can't find it because it isn't there.

204
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,720
Okay, 533.

205
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:16,480
What happens is, in a way that sort of loose ends, anytime I find these loose ends, there's probably some better thing to say, so you should be ready to dump in and help.

206
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,000
We're just told like this, the following.

207
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,600
Three days after Dmitry's arrest, at the top of 533, Grushenka was taken very ill and was ill for nearly five weeks.

208
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,000
For one whole week, she was unconscious.

209
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:38,720
Well, that's typical Dostoevsky, sort of mixing physical sickness with spiritual insight.

210
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:46,000
After all, Markle has brain fever, and he discovers that we should love everything and everybody and be servants to everybody.

211
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,201
And the mysterious visitor has heart problems because he's gotten too much love all of a sudden and so forth.

212
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:59,921
Grushenka has suffering problems, and she's suffering from some disease or other, which knocks her out.

213
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:07,201
And when she comes out of the sickness, because it's really a spiritual as well as a physical sickness, she's transformed.

214
00:21:07,201 --> 00:21:10,561
She was very much changed, thinner and a little sallow.

215
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,600
So she was for the, though she had for the past two weeks been well enough to go out.

216
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:21,921
And to Alyasha, her face was even more attractive than before, and he liked to meet her eyes when he visited her.

217
00:21:22,161 --> 00:21:25,360
Recognize why Dostoevsky throws that in?

218
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:27,120
Somebody might think.

219
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,280
That's right.

220
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,080
Who says this?

221
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,520
So yes, he wouldn't look at her.

222
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,201
He was afraid to look at her before.

223
00:21:33,201 --> 00:21:37,360
Now she's transformed and he's transformed and so they can look at each other.

224
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:40,560
A look of firmness and purpose had developed in her face.

225
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:47,760
There were signs of, guess what, a spiritual transformation in her, a steadfast, fine, and humble determination.

226
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:59,881
She has suffered in a kind of micro way and been reborn in a kind of micro way, just the way you want with a double for Dimitri, except that it's all sort of thrown at you there and you just either take it or not.

227
00:21:59,881 --> 00:22:05,081
It doesn't, Boston doesn't go to any trouble to spell it out or get you to believe it.

228
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,840
But that's because he's going to spell it out at endless length with Dimitri.

229
00:22:08,841 --> 00:22:15,000
And with her, he's just keeping his existential doubles intact, I think.

230
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:23,720
So then, okay, now, so we've got, everybody has to suffer and purify themselves of their dark side.

231
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:34,041
They come into the world with a sinful lust, sort of animal-ish or insect-ish dark side, and they have to fix it.

232
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,880
That's the first reason to suffer.

233
00:22:36,201 --> 00:22:41,000
But then there's another reason, namely expiating your crimes.

234
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,600
And now that's got a lot of sub-parts, which I'll come back to next time.

235
00:22:44,601 --> 00:22:47,800
By the way, next time I will have to tell you who did it.

236
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,040
And how many already have got far enough to know who did it?

237
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,681
Oh, good.

238
00:22:52,681 --> 00:22:57,401
Well, the rest of you are in for big, you'd spoil fun if you don't hurry and read it.

239
00:22:57,401 --> 00:23:02,201
Because it's certainly one of the most convoluted and surprising murder mysteries ever written.

240
00:23:02,201 --> 00:23:06,841
You still, by the time you're on page, I don't know, 600, you're still going to know who did it.

241
00:23:06,841 --> 00:23:08,840
But I have to tell you pretty soon.

242
00:23:08,841 --> 00:23:15,961
So, anyway, but not right now, because expiation could be that you have bad desires.

243
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:19,240
Dimitri certainly desired to kill his father.

244
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,600
It could be because you actually sort of hire somebody to do it.

245
00:23:25,401 --> 00:23:27,400
I won't tell you who that might be.

246
00:23:27,961 --> 00:23:31,081
It could be because you really do it, kill somebody.

247
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:42,881
I mean, all these are forms of guilt or doing something morally wrong for which you've got to expiate because, and all the whole mysterious visitor story comes in.

248
00:23:43,601 --> 00:24:06,160
As long as you don't, you're cut off from everybody because you have to live a lie because you have to hide the fact that you had this bad desire and still defines part of who you are, or that you hired somebody to do this terrible thing, like in Woody Allen's Crimes and Misdemeanors, which I mention every once in a while, but you guys haven't seen.

249
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:09,201
He hires a mafia person to kill his mistress.

250
00:24:09,201 --> 00:24:17,280
And once you do something like that, you can't really relate to other people in an honest and intimate way because they don't really know who you are.

251
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,681
So that's the mysterious visitor thing.

252
00:24:19,681 --> 00:24:31,921
So all these forms of morally wrong behavior, from desire to outright murder, are something that you've got to suffer to get over.

253
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:43,280
You have to accept the suffering for your criminal deeds because the crime tears you out of the web of interconnectedness and puts you into the hell of isolation.

254
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:50,161
And only by confession, you get out of that hell back into heaven of connectedness to human beings.

255
00:24:50,161 --> 00:24:53,600
That's just a review, really, of the mysterious visitor.

256
00:24:53,601 --> 00:25:01,120
Now comes the hard part, the part I wish I could sort of convince you of, but I can't because I'm not convinced of it.

257
00:25:01,121 --> 00:25:02,961
And I don't know if Dostoevsky is.

258
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:04,000
He tries hard.

259
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:14,641
But the sacrament, the Christian, important Christian view, which he's trying to existentialize, is pretty weird.

260
00:25:14,641 --> 00:25:16,161
I mean, I can't get it.

261
00:25:16,161 --> 00:25:18,000
And usually I can.

262
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,961
I mean, it's that when Jesus suffered on the cross, he suffered for everybody.

263
00:25:23,881 --> 00:25:31,240
And he was an innocent who took on the guilt and suffering and somehow took it away from the other people.

264
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,681
That can't quite be right, but that's how it looks.

265
00:25:34,681 --> 00:25:39,321
And of course, that's how Alyosha understands it.

266
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:50,201
When after the Grand Inquisitor story, remember, he says to Yvonne, Ah, but we can make up for all that suffering, because there is the innocent one who suffered for all of us.

267
00:25:50,201 --> 00:25:55,880
Now, at least Dostoevsky is not going to believe that it's an innocent one who suffered for us.

268
00:25:55,881 --> 00:25:58,520
He thinks that's just plain wrong.

269
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:04,280
But we've gone over that, as in the idiot and so forth.

270
00:26:04,681 --> 00:26:09,400
If you are really innocent, you can't suffer for anybody, do any good.

271
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:14,520
But there is still the somebody takes on the suffering for all of us.

272
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:24,600
And I don't understand how anybody could do this, or why anybody would want to do this, or why anybody would want anybody to do this.

273
00:26:24,601 --> 00:26:28,601
Because if you don't suffer your own suffering, how are you going to be purified?

274
00:26:28,601 --> 00:26:31,561
How are you going to get back in touch with people and so forth?

275
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:43,161
It doesn't seem to me somebody else suffering on the cross is going to purify me or get me back in touch with the people whose close friends I just killed or some once killed and so forth.

276
00:26:43,161 --> 00:26:44,361
So this is puzzling.

277
00:26:44,361 --> 00:26:46,841
But Dostoevsky bravely takes it on.

278
00:26:46,841 --> 00:26:59,640
Dimitri is going to suffer to be purified, to expiate his criminal desire, and somehow take on the suffering of everybody.

279
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,840
I have a quote here.

280
00:27:00,841 --> 00:27:03,601
I guess I may never have read it.

281
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:03,921
I know.

282
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:08,320
I don't know.

283
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,840
People listening on the iPod, I'm sorry for you guys.

284
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,240
Okay, now let's see.

285
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:20,480
On page one that I didn't read on 486, or at least I don't think I read it.

286
00:27:24,961 --> 00:27:25,840
Oh, yes, I did.

287
00:27:25,841 --> 00:27:26,800
I thought maybe I did, too.

288
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,161
That's why I got confused.

289
00:27:28,161 --> 00:27:33,681
It's, yeah, he's taking on this guilt for having desired the death of his father.

290
00:27:33,681 --> 00:27:37,520
I accept my punishment not because I killed him, because I meant to.

291
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:44,321
Of course, all through this, we don't know whether those of you who haven't gotten there don't know whether to believe Dimitri or not.

292
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,120
Some of the people think he really did kill old Karamatsov.

293
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,160
He just won't admit it.

294
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,241
Some people didn't do it.

295
00:27:50,241 --> 00:27:52,080
I'm not telling this time.

296
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,601
But next time I will.

297
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,280
Okay, so let's see.

298
00:27:55,281 --> 00:27:58,640
So now, now we get to the big deal thing.

299
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:06,561
Dimitri is going to suffer for everybody, and he's going to, by way of that, become a new man, be resurrected.

300
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:20,401
This is the real existentializing, the effort anyway, of Postoevsky to existentialize why Jesus had to suffer on the cross and why, when he did suffer on the cross, he's resurrected.

301
00:28:20,401 --> 00:28:29,681
So at the end of the Passion movie, I gather you see him there recovered completely from all the bad suffering you've just gone through.

302
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,361
So let's look at it.

303
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,120
To begin with, this isn't something I made up.

304
00:28:35,441 --> 00:28:46,721
Dimitri is already, when he's convicted by the court and he's going to go to Siberia, he constantly calls this a a crucifixion.

305
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,360
And he says he's not going to run away from his crucifixion on 563.

306
00:28:51,361 --> 00:29:00,361
I mean, this is just Dostoevsky hitting you over the head with what sacrament, what Christian belief he's fixing.

307
00:29:02,281 --> 00:29:03,560
Let's see, maybe not this one.

308
00:29:03,721 --> 00:29:07,560
On 563, yeah, starting at the bottom.

309
00:29:07,881 --> 00:29:17,800
I would have, if he goes, if he doesn't go to Siberia and escapes, which is what Yvonne wants him to do, I would have run away from suffering.

310
00:29:17,801 --> 00:29:19,080
The sign has come.

311
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,681
I reject the sign.

312
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,560
I have a way of salvation and I turn my back on it.

313
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:27,000
That is, if he doesn't suffer and doesn't go to Siberia.

314
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,401
Yvonne says that in America, with goodwill, I can be of more use than in the underground.

315
00:29:31,401 --> 00:29:33,721
But what becomes of our hymn from the underground?

316
00:29:33,721 --> 00:29:34,520
What's America?

317
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,281
America is vanity again.

318
00:29:36,281 --> 00:29:39,000
But there's a lot of swindling in America, too.

319
00:29:39,401 --> 00:29:40,761
Never mind all that.

320
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,441
I should have run away from crucifixion.

321
00:29:44,441 --> 00:29:46,280
You see, there it is.

322
00:29:46,281 --> 00:29:50,040
Dostoevsky is telling you that's what Yvonne is up to.

323
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,681
That's what Yvonne's suffering is about.

324
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:57,240
So now we have to follow it more and see what goes on with it.

325
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:05,881
Unless that's not enough, so on 717, we get it all over again.

326
00:30:05,881 --> 00:30:11,161
Instead of talking about the crucifixion, we talked about carrying a cross, which is very interesting.

327
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:21,721
And that's on page 717 at the bottom.

328
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:28,201
So, Alyasha is talking to Dimitri and Prison, three lines down.

329
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,721
What you're not ready to go to Siberia.

330
00:30:33,721 --> 00:30:35,881
Such a cross is not for you.

331
00:30:35,881 --> 00:30:41,601
What's more, you needn't need such a martyr's cross when you are not ready for it.

332
00:30:41,921 --> 00:30:46,401
If you had murdered our father, it would disturb me that you rejected your punishment.

333
00:30:46,401 --> 00:30:48,240
By the way, don't think that proves that he hasn't.

334
00:30:48,401 --> 00:30:50,480
Alyasha never thought he had.

335
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,681
But you are innocent, and such a cross is too much for you.

336
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,881
You wanted to make yourself into a new man by suffering.

337
00:30:56,881 --> 00:31:03,441
I say only remember that that other man always, all your life, and wherever you go, and that will be enough for you.

338
00:31:03,441 --> 00:31:09,520
Your refusal to carry that great cross will only serve to make you feel all your life an even greater duty.

339
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:14,161
That will do more to make a new man of you than if you went there.

340
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:21,361
So just as sort of desiring to commit a crime is as bad as committing the crime.

341
00:31:21,361 --> 00:31:30,080
So being willing, eager to suffer for that crime can be as good as actually suffering for it.

342
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,641
That seems to be what Alyasha is saying here.

343
00:31:32,881 --> 00:31:35,680
That it's enough that Dmitry remembers that.

344
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,120
He was eager to go to Siberia and suffer.

345
00:31:39,281 --> 00:31:43,921
This hasn't got us to the heart of the puzzle yet, but we're getting there.

346
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:57,040
Now here we go when we really, Dostoevsky tries to existentialize the crucifixion and what's sometimes called the vicarious suffering of Jesus, suffering for everybody.

347
00:31:57,361 --> 00:32:00,081
675.

348
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:05,841
The only thing I can think, the only way I can defend Dostoevsky is that he doesn't really believe it.

349
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:08,080
I mean, because it never really happens.

350
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:16,641
He doesn't show you anybody who suffers for everybody and helps them attain joy.

351
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,361
This is what Dmitri is thinking about doing, going to Siberia and so forth.

352
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:29,000
But I don't know why he doesn't actually do it, except that Dostoevsky doesn't know what it would be to do it.

353
00:32:29,321 --> 00:32:33,561
Therefore, neither do I, because I learned all this from Dostoevsky.

354
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,600
So, on 560, what is it?

355
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,561
560.

356
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,961
Well, let me go and look.

357
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,560
Looks like 560.

358
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,161
Let's try that.

359
00:32:52,921 --> 00:32:55,081
Okay, all this talk now.

360
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,120
Then I'm going to let you talk.

361
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:01,000
So be prepared to say something about this so we can make some progress on this together.

362
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,841
But here's what he's up to at the top of 560.

363
00:33:04,841 --> 00:33:06,760
Why was it I dreamed of that babe?

364
00:33:06,761 --> 00:33:11,401
He was dreaming of a hungry child and the crying mother and all that.

365
00:33:12,361 --> 00:33:14,361
Where was I at that such a moment?

366
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:16,441
Why is the babe so pure?

367
00:33:16,441 --> 00:33:17,160
Poor.

368
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:27,000
That was a sign to me at that moment that it's for the babe I'm going, because we are all responsible for all, for all the babes.

369
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,361
For there are big children as well as little children, all the babes.

370
00:33:30,361 --> 00:33:33,881
I go for all because someone must go for all.

371
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,961
Now that's the funny line.

372
00:33:35,961 --> 00:33:37,961
What in the world is it to go for all?

373
00:33:37,961 --> 00:33:39,560
What good does it do the babe?

374
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,561
What good does it do anybody that Dimitri goes for them?

375
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,480
I just don't get it.

376
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,520
I mean, so let's go on.

377
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:52,841
Skipping a little.

378
00:33:52,921 --> 00:33:56,440
Oh, yes, we shall be in chains in Siberia, and there will be no freedom.

379
00:33:56,441 --> 00:34:00,121
But then, in our great sorrow, we shall rise again to joy.

380
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,720
Rise again to joy.

381
00:34:01,721 --> 00:34:03,321
That's the resurrection.

382
00:34:03,321 --> 00:34:17,041
Having gone to Siberia, taken on the suffering of all the suffering people of the world, and done it for them somehow, he will be joyful, and so will everybody else.

383
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,641
Skipping a little.

384
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,841
And then we men underground to the end of the paragraph.

385
00:34:21,841 --> 00:34:28,000
And then we men underground will sing from the bowels of the earth a glorious hymn to God with whom is joy.

386
00:34:28,321 --> 00:34:31,280
And that's the idea.

387
00:34:32,881 --> 00:34:37,280
Now, anybody got any idea where, what's missing?

388
00:34:37,281 --> 00:34:51,041
I mean, somehow the conviction that I feel about the incarnation story and the confession and baptism, which is pretty amazing and brilliant, far-fetched, with the doctor and the nuts and so forth.

389
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,480
I don't get it with this.

390
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,600
I can't convince you.

391
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,321
I have no feel for it.

392
00:34:56,321 --> 00:35:00,160
And I don't know whether it's me or Dostoevsky or what.

393
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,441
Yeah, say something.

394
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,760
But I don't like it.

395
00:35:17,841 --> 00:35:18,720
Yes, of course.

396
00:35:18,801 --> 00:35:20,480
I think that's very interesting what you're saying.

397
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,760
Let's see if I got it right.

398
00:35:21,761 --> 00:35:40,801
I mean, he could suffer for everyone in the sense of an example of how to suffer right, not taking the place of their suffering, not even taking on their suffering, but being the paradigm example of how to suffer in a non-lacerating, non-tormenting, accepting way.

399
00:35:40,801 --> 00:35:45,760
And thereby, he becomes joyful and he becomes an example for everybody else.

400
00:35:45,761 --> 00:35:46,800
That's terrific.

401
00:35:46,801 --> 00:35:48,561
It's a step forward.

402
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,880
Anybody?

403
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:52,081
I mean, yeah.

404
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:57,881
Talking like what?

405
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,440
Yes, yes.

406
00:36:00,441 --> 00:36:02,840
In the sense that he is, that's what she's saying too, right?

407
00:36:02,841 --> 00:36:07,081
That he is, remember, I think I said Kierkegaard says Jesus is the paradigm.

408
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,241
That is, he's the perfect example.

409
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:24,601
So far, we saw Marco, while playing Jesus was the perfect example of the complete connectedness to everything, even the animals and the birds, and of the amazing joy it brings you, meaningly being in paradise.

410
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:38,841
So now Demetri ought to be the paradigm of how to suffer, accepting your suffering and accepting it and thereby turning it into finally into some kind of joy.

411
00:36:38,841 --> 00:36:43,961
He's the, I think she's got it right, you both have got it right, he's the paradigm.

412
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,801
That's the sense in which he suffers for everybody.

413
00:36:47,801 --> 00:36:51,880
Not that he takes on their suffering, certainly not that he's innocent.

414
00:36:52,761 --> 00:36:57,961
Those are all wrong ways of thinking about the crucifixion, Dostoevsky would say.

415
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,441
He can't pay the debt for other people who did wrong things.

416
00:37:02,441 --> 00:37:04,601
They've got to suffer themselves.

417
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:10,840
But he can show what that would look like, thereby existentializing.

418
00:37:10,841 --> 00:37:13,161
I think that's, you think you two have got it.

419
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,720
Anybody else want to finish the job?

420
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,801
I knew we would, I fell through.

421
00:37:17,801 --> 00:37:19,880
I was just about to finally get it.

422
00:37:19,961 --> 00:37:26,000
Now we's one part of the story.

423
00:37:26,281 --> 00:37:37,520
And that is that a big part of the of the message of the investigative crucifixion can be innocent because I'm doing for others is that this is additional functions.

424
00:37:37,761 --> 00:37:42,160
Because the people and skills don't have the ability to respond to their own sense.

425
00:37:37,241 --> 00:37:43,200
They need to step.

426
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:54,561
And so you can put it back element by saying then that is what's already that also the infant can't do it so I can not in any way.

427
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,440
There has to be more functionality.

428
00:37:57,761 --> 00:37:58,401
That's good.

429
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,361
That's right.

430
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:02,240
You can't, that's part of what Dimitri demonstrates.

431
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:03,360
We've got to add it.

432
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:08,241
He demonstrates that you can suffer, that it isn't up to you.

433
00:38:08,241 --> 00:38:13,441
You have to accept the situation and the kind of suffering that the situation brings you.

434
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:15,120
But it doesn't, you'll have no problem with that.

435
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,441
Everybody's got the kind of self that will make them suffer.

436
00:38:17,441 --> 00:38:20,961
Everybody's got desires for which they should suffer.

437
00:38:21,361 --> 00:38:28,000
But Dimitri shows that you've got to accept the situation and the suffering that comes to you.

438
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,921
And then you do it in the right way.

439
00:38:29,921 --> 00:38:34,640
You can't just sort of march in and take it over willfully that you're going to suffer.

440
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,680
That's what you're saying.

441
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,041
Yeah, accept it.

442
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,240
Be receptive to the suffering that's around.

443
00:38:40,241 --> 00:38:43,681
So he's going to be a paradigm of three things, it looks like.

444
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,561
Be receptive to the suffering that's around.

445
00:38:47,441 --> 00:38:55,361
Then fully suffer and accept it.

446
00:38:55,361 --> 00:39:02,961
So be receptive to it, accept it and throw yourself into it, and then you can become joyful.

447
00:39:02,961 --> 00:39:04,721
He chose all three.

448
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,800
I still think we don't get it shown very well.

449
00:39:08,801 --> 00:39:10,721
We get it talked about a lot.

450
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,560
That's the different problem.

451
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,601
I mean, Dostoevsky's clearly got the right idea of what he wants to existentialize.

452
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,961
And Dimitri makes lots of speeches about it.

453
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:30,921
And I think the excuse for Dostoevsky is he tended to do this in the, he was going to do this in the second volume of the Brothers, which he didn't write.

454
00:39:30,921 --> 00:39:32,441
He's got to end this one.

455
00:39:32,441 --> 00:39:36,520
It's already 900 pages long or whatever, depending on your book.

456
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:47,720
And he's got plenty of room in the second one to show, well, Alyasha's got to suffer for his demons, and Lisa's got to suffer her demons, and Yvonne certainly has to suffer.

457
00:39:47,721 --> 00:39:52,041
We'll hear more about him before the end, but we won't hear how he ever did it right.

458
00:39:52,361 --> 00:39:56,520
Though there's one sentence that suggests that Yvonne finally got it right.

459
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,120
I'll tell you when we get there.

460
00:39:58,441 --> 00:40:02,441
Anyway, I think the whole suffering issue must be put off for the next book.

461
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,761
And all we get really here is speeches.

462
00:40:04,761 --> 00:40:10,121
But at least now we understand what the speeches are saying, and that's a step forward, all right?

463
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,160
So where were we?

464
00:40:11,401 --> 00:40:14,040
On 560, is that where we are?

465
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:14,760
Yes.

466
00:40:15,721 --> 00:40:19,480
And all the people are going to sing this hymn of praise.

467
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,360
So now I'll read you my old notes, but maybe they're wrong now.

468
00:40:24,361 --> 00:40:25,080
Maybe they're not.

469
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,041
Let's see.

470
00:40:27,241 --> 00:40:40,761
So we're supposed to think like Zosima, that even if you're innocent of any specific crime, you should feel responsible for all the suffering in the world and want to make whatever sacrifices are necessary to help.

471
00:40:40,761 --> 00:40:48,601
Now, if that's just empty talk, like it is with Zosima, because he just stays in the monastery, that's not very convincing.

472
00:40:48,600 --> 00:41:12,721
But if you think of somebody like Mother Teresa, who suffers her whole life, gives up her comfortable life to live with and help the untouchables in India, then you can see she's not trying to help all the sufferers in the world, but she's trying, she gives her whole life to help the sufferers that are in her world, that are near enough for her to be able to do something about it.

473
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:15,760
And she does that presumably with love and joy.

474
00:41:15,761 --> 00:41:20,800
I don't know much about the life of Mother Teresa, but that must be the right sort of guess.

475
00:41:20,801 --> 00:41:24,480
If anybody knows more and says I'm wrong, then I better fix it.

476
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,081
So he's like that.

477
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,640
Dimitri understands sort of applied zosima.

478
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:41,761
In the real world, you suffer the suffering that you've got and fix the suffering around you as much as you can, even if that makes you suffer more.

479
00:41:41,761 --> 00:41:46,801
That's the story about how he's going to have to go to Siberia to help with prisoners.

480
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:55,041
But it's wrong to say that that helps other people because he's suffering for them, for all.

481
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,880
See, now we've got their interpretation of for all.

482
00:41:58,881 --> 00:42:02,881
Not that he's taking on their suffering, he's showing them how to suffer.

483
00:42:02,881 --> 00:42:04,801
In that sense, he suffers for all.

484
00:42:04,961 --> 00:42:05,921
Like it.

485
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,681
He shows how to suffer the right way.

486
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,400
To suffer then with humility, not with pride.

487
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:32,480
I'm putting Yvonne aside for a while, but Yvonne and Katerina are, and particularly Yvonne, Katerina's kind of existential double for Yvonne, that Yvonne is the perfect example of how not to suffer.

488
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,160
And we'll see how that will.

489
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,160
And he also thinks he's being crucified.

490
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,200
But Yvonne isn't going to be resurrected in joy.

491
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,881
Yvonne is going to die.

492
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,681
But I don't want to jump ahead.

493
00:42:47,281 --> 00:42:49,041
So let's see now.

494
00:42:51,281 --> 00:42:53,401
So we're all guilty.

495
00:42:53,401 --> 00:42:55,160
We should all ask forgiveness.

496
00:42:52,721 --> 00:42:58,441
We should all make sacrifices to make the world a better place.

497
00:42:58,761 --> 00:43:04,201
In that sense, now I'm adding, and in that sense, Dimitri does suffer for all.

498
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:10,841
And so the question is, will Dimitri manage to pull this off?

499
00:43:10,841 --> 00:43:16,040
Will he be able to accept three kinds of suffering and show them in the right way?

500
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:21,880
Purification, expiation, and what I'm now going to call exemplary sacrifice.

501
00:43:21,881 --> 00:43:25,320
That's the sort of paradigm kind of suffering.

502
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,480
And if he does, will he be resurrected?

503
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,281
Will he start singing a hymn and be joyful?

504
00:43:32,281 --> 00:43:35,161
And now comes this very funny part.

505
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,601
I think it's really neat.

506
00:43:37,321 --> 00:43:49,000
Whenever anybody gets into one of these big deal existential situations where they've got to make a choice, and it isn't really just a simple choice, it's where their whole life has to go in one direction or another.

507
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,361
Guess what happens?

508
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:53,641
You get a battle of the angel and the devil.

509
00:43:54,200 --> 00:44:02,201
The God and the devil are fighting, and we now would change it to the angel and the devil are fighting, and the soul of man is the battlefield.

510
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:12,281
So now everything turns on whether he's going to accept suffering as the right kind of crucifixion and get resurrected, and who should show up?

511
00:44:12,281 --> 00:44:14,441
But who's the devil?

512
00:44:14,441 --> 00:44:16,601
Ratitin shows up.

513
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,241
And tries to convince him out of it.

514
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:23,401
Alyasha has said, yeah, you've got to do it.

515
00:44:23,401 --> 00:44:28,520
You've got to suffer, or at least be willing to suffer and remember that you were willing to suffer.

516
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:37,360
But then we get a scene, and this is where I think Dostoevsky has this weird sense of humor, and loves doing this devil story.

517
00:44:37,361 --> 00:44:41,041
555.

518
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:54,080
So in 555, Alyasha goes to visit Dmitry in prison, and in the middle of 555, you get a scene where something interesting happens.

519
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,520
You see what you think.

520
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:02,480
As Alyasha entered the room, set aside for interviews, he came upon Rakitin, who was just saying goodbye to Dmitry.

521
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,081
They were both talking loudly.

522
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,881
Dimitri was laughing while Rakitin seemed to be grumbling.

523
00:45:06,881 --> 00:45:11,281
Rakitin did not like meeting Alyasha, especially of late.

524
00:45:11,281 --> 00:45:13,361
Devils don't like meeting angels.

525
00:45:13,361 --> 00:45:18,161
He secretly spoke, he scarcely spoke to him and bowed to him stiffly.

526
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:26,560
Seeing Alyasha enter now, he frowned and looked away, as though he were entirely absorbed in buttoning his big warm fur-trimmed overcoat.

527
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,000
You see why that's funny?

528
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,761
He goes out like this.

529
00:45:29,761 --> 00:45:43,841
I mean, the official devil pose when the angel comes in all of a sudden and catches him there trying to fix, undermine Dimitri's crucifixion plan.

530
00:45:44,401 --> 00:45:45,761
And how does he do it?

531
00:45:45,761 --> 00:45:50,000
Well, how is Rakitin doing it, or has he already done it?

532
00:45:50,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Well, by telling Dimitri about the discovery in Paris by Claude Bernard of neurons.

533
00:46:00,321 --> 00:46:08,480
And he's told him about neurons because he's going to tell him, well, as long as we're just a bunch of neurons, it doesn't matter whether you expiate it or not.

534
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:22,441
All this existential, he didn't put it this way, Rakitin, but he was, his idea is all this big deal existential business about love and expiation and suffering and joy, that's just a sort of epiphenomenal, philosophers would say.

535
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,840
All you really got is a lot of neurons firing.

536
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:32,200
So you might as well just do whatever is most fun because you might as well make your, you know, jiggle your neurons in the best, most pleasant way.

537
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,441
Secrete the most dopamine would be the latest version, I guess.

538
00:46:36,441 --> 00:46:39,321
But so that's all what's going on.

539
00:46:39,321 --> 00:46:47,081
And you, you, and Dimitri sort of admits it on 672.

540
00:46:47,401 --> 00:46:49,561
Getting these wrong 557.

541
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,641
Okay, here, 557.

542
00:46:52,281 --> 00:47:01,320
So when, after Rakitin slinks out and he is driven away by the angel way, then Dimitri tries to explain what they've been talking about.

543
00:47:01,321 --> 00:47:05,561
And he says, I'm sorry to lose God.

544
00:47:05,961 --> 00:47:09,321
And Alyasha says, what do you mean by sorry to lose God?

545
00:47:09,321 --> 00:47:14,920
Then Dimitri, who isn't very bright, but a nice guy, but this is too much for him.

546
00:47:14,921 --> 00:47:17,801
He says, imagine inside the nerves in the head.

547
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:20,921
That is, these nerves are there in the brain, damn them.

548
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:26,520
There are sort of little tails, little tails of the nerves, and as soon as they begin quivering, that is, you see.

549
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:30,840
I look at something with my eyes, and they begin quivering, the little tails.

550
00:47:30,921 --> 00:47:33,401
When they quiver, then an image appears.

551
00:47:33,401 --> 00:47:39,480
It doesn't appear at once, but an instant of second passes, and then something like a movement appears.

552
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,480
Not a movement, but not a movement.

553
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,280
Devil take the moment and so forth.

554
00:47:44,281 --> 00:47:46,280
If it's funny in there, the devil take the moment.

555
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:48,681
That's the Rakitan influence all that.

556
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,800
Then he jumps a little.

557
00:47:49,801 --> 00:47:53,320
Rakitin explained it all to me yesterday, and it bowled me over.

558
00:47:53,321 --> 00:47:55,881
It's wonderful, Alyasha, this science.

559
00:47:55,881 --> 00:47:58,680
A new man arising, that I understand.

560
00:47:58,761 --> 00:48:00,520
Yet I'm sorry to lose God.

561
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:04,040
The new man arising is this typical Dostoevsky move.

562
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,081
There are two versions of the new man arising.

563
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:17,841
The Christian version, being reborn with joy and purity and closeness to others, and the Enlightenment new man.

564
00:48:17,841 --> 00:48:27,600
That is, the new man who is completely understood by physics and chemistry and can control his genes and his life and is autonomous and so forth.

565
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:37,441
That new man, in some version, materialist or Kantian or whatever, is the view that Alyasha, that Dostoevsky is against.

566
00:48:37,761 --> 00:48:39,200
But they sound the same.

567
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:45,121
So Rakitin's been proposing a resurrection of a sort, the new man arising.

568
00:48:46,721 --> 00:48:48,401
Let's see now.

569
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,841
And we're going to get into in a minute something very interesting, how Alyasha is going to deal with this.

570
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:06,000
Of course, well, let's see what does Dostoevsky think about this latest news from physics and chemistry and physiology about the neurons.

571
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:17,760
Does he think it must be wrong, the way some people think that evolution must be wrong, and get into a hand-on collision with science and have to claim that there aren't any neurons underlying all our thinking and seeing?

572
00:49:17,761 --> 00:49:19,761
Dostoevsky would never do that.

573
00:49:19,761 --> 00:49:29,201
He thinks simply that the neurons are doing their wiggling thing, and that's fine, and that's the causal basis of all of our mental states.

574
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,480
But it doesn't contradict the existential truth.

575
00:49:33,921 --> 00:49:42,881
It doesn't contradict the experience and the meaning that we have, that it's got a material basis in neuron activity.

576
00:49:42,841 --> 00:49:45,520
So, and does he try to explain that to Dmitry?

577
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,000
No, Dimitri wouldn't understand that for sure.

578
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,961
What he does is sort of interesting, but it's sort of subtle because you can't actually say it or see it.

579
00:49:52,801 --> 00:49:56,041
He just changes the subject.

580
00:49:56,361 --> 00:50:02,520
He just refuses to engage in a discussion of neurons and whether that, and the new man and all that.

581
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:08,441
And within a paragraph, what's this?

582
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,281
Dimitri has forgotten it.

583
00:50:10,281 --> 00:50:11,961
Well, maybe it's two pages.

584
00:50:11,961 --> 00:50:13,080
He's gotten over it.

585
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,160
I don't know exactly where he gets over it.

586
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,121
I think almost instantly he starts thinking about something else.

587
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,801
Yeah, let's just read a little further.

588
00:50:19,801 --> 00:50:21,961
When he says, I'm sorry to lose God.

589
00:50:21,961 --> 00:50:24,280
Well, that's a good thing, anyway, said Alyasha.

590
00:50:24,281 --> 00:50:25,881
That's his whole comment on it.

591
00:50:25,881 --> 00:50:27,320
Then I'm sorry to lose God.

592
00:50:27,321 --> 00:50:28,841
It's chemistry, Alyasha.

593
00:50:28,841 --> 00:50:29,320
Chemistry.

594
00:50:29,321 --> 00:50:30,921
There's no help for it, Your Reverence.

595
00:50:30,921 --> 00:50:32,280
You must make way for chemistry.

596
00:50:32,281 --> 00:50:34,281
And Rakitin dislikes God.

597
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,361
Oh, doesn't he dislike him?

598
00:50:36,361 --> 00:50:40,120
Well, naturally, he isn't really Satan.

599
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,321
He's a devil.

600
00:50:41,321 --> 00:50:44,600
The devil, a devil, dislikes God.

601
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:51,961
And then he goes on about without God, no immortality, and so forth.

602
00:50:51,961 --> 00:50:55,961
But by the next page, no, let's see when it really changes.

603
00:50:59,401 --> 00:51:01,721
Oh, yeah, he's by the top of the next page.

604
00:51:01,721 --> 00:51:04,280
He's off talking about his poem.

605
00:51:04,281 --> 00:51:10,281
And the poem is all about, it takes him away thinking from the way he was thinking before.

606
00:51:10,921 --> 00:51:19,961
By the bottom of 559, about two-thirds down, Dimitri's forgotten all about the neurons, and he's back existentialized.

607
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:27,081
Alyasha, these last two months I found in myself a new man, a new man risen up in me.

608
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,520
Well, arisen.

609
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:34,041
I mean, there you get the very, if you didn't know that this was about the resurrection, that's the clue.

610
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,520
Just like they've been talking about the cross up to now.

611
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:39,361
Now they're going to talk about the new man arising.

612
00:51:39,361 --> 00:51:43,920
And when they do, they're done talking about the neurons.

613
00:51:44,721 --> 00:51:52,000
And he gives the story, which I've already read, about how he's going to go for everyone, because somebody must go for all, and so forth.

614
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:05,520
He certainly doesn't put it very well, but whether given not as well as you put it, and you put it, but either Dostoevsky is being true to the fact that Dimitri is not very bright, or Dostoevsky can't do any better.

615
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,320
I don't know which.

616
00:52:06,321 --> 00:52:14,160
My hunch is, I'm really such a Dostoevsky fan, that he knows perfectly well that Dimitri isn't quite getting it right, and he's got a whole second book, he thinks.

617
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,520
He doesn't know he's going to die.

618
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,840
And he'll get it right in the second book.

619
00:52:17,841 --> 00:52:18,720
He'll show it.

620
00:52:18,721 --> 00:52:19,760
He'll explain it.

621
00:52:19,921 --> 00:52:25,681
Anyway, here, all we've got is Dimitri's somewhat simple-minded view of it.

622
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,241
But now let's see.

623
00:52:29,841 --> 00:52:37,121
So there you get the new man, and not the enlightenment kind of new man.

624
00:52:37,441 --> 00:52:40,480
And that we just read.

625
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:59,361
And so it's this acceptance of all of this that Dimitri can say that the new man has arisen, because that is the existentialized resurrection story.

626
00:52:59,361 --> 00:53:15,201
That's that everybody will come out of the suffering, connected with everybody else, and experiencing joy and knowing that they're in paradise here and now, if they can only do it right, and now, given what you guys say, and Dimitri's going to show them how to do it right.

627
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:15,680
Okay.

628
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:22,120
Now, there's something I can keep thinking in the back of my head I wanted to say about this, which I thought was funny.

629
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,641
Lost it.

630
00:53:21,841 --> 00:53:26,761
Well, when I remember, I'll come back to it.

631
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:30,681
But I wanted, we have just time to do what I wanted to finish today.

632
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,760
But I mean, we have time too for discussion always.

633
00:53:32,761 --> 00:53:34,441
So, anybody want to say anything?

634
00:53:34,441 --> 00:53:43,240
I think we've now finished the right way of thinking about the resurrection, crucifixion, the crucifixion and resurrection.

635
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,321
But we want to see now the wrong way.

636
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:52,841
And we want to see whether the wrong way also is called crucifixion.

637
00:53:52,841 --> 00:54:03,321
Because it should be, because Dostoevsky, remember, I started the lecture saying there are two, there's the masochistic side to Christianity, and there's the joy side.

638
00:54:03,321 --> 00:54:08,121
And both of them have a claim on the crucifixion and the suffering.

639
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,841
So what would it be to get the suffering wrong?

640
00:54:10,841 --> 00:54:14,120
Well, I've said already who, but I just want to ensure you are listening.

641
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,841
Who is the model for getting the suffering wrong?

642
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:17,961
Yeah.

643
00:54:17,961 --> 00:54:18,681
Huh?

644
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,120
Yvonne, exactly.

645
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:25,881
So now we're switching to Yvonne and masochistic martyrdom as a parody of crucifixion.

646
00:54:25,881 --> 00:54:27,641
That's what's going to happen there.

647
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:31,080
But it's still, it's very tightly related to crucifixion.

648
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,641
It's just our wrong way to do it.

649
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,120
Oh, now here's the funny thing.

650
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,880
No wonder I hadn't quite got to it.

651
00:54:37,881 --> 00:54:39,801
I think it's really, really weird.

652
00:54:39,801 --> 00:54:44,441
So Dostoevsky, this is one of the weirdest moves Dostoevsky makes.

653
00:54:44,441 --> 00:54:47,561
What goes on in his head is unbelievable.

654
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:58,520
So he would like to establish early on in the book this certain relation between Yvonne and Dimitri, which he's going to cash out, say, 500 pages later.

655
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:02,840
So in 257, something really strange happens.

656
00:55:02,921 --> 00:55:10,961
I don't know whether I found this or somebody else found this, but I always thought it's one of the funniest little things that Dostoevsky's tucked in here.

657
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:14,640
Okay, on 257, that first full paragraph.

658
00:55:14,961 --> 00:55:25,841
They've just been talking about rebellion and Yvonne's despair that he's going to commit suicide later, age of 30.

659
00:55:25,841 --> 00:55:29,920
And now Yvonne turned suddenly and went his way without looking back.

660
00:55:29,921 --> 00:55:34,801
It was just as Dmitri had left Alyasha the day before, though the parting had been very different.

661
00:55:34,801 --> 00:55:38,000
So now we get Yvonne and Dmitry associated.

662
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:44,641
The strange resemblance flashed like an arrow through Alyasha's mind in the distress and rejection of that moment.

663
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,121
He waited a little looking after his brother.

664
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:51,920
He noticed that Yvonne swayed as he walked and that his right shoulder was lower than his left.

665
00:55:51,921 --> 00:55:53,681
He never noticed it before.

666
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
What is he doing?

667
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,041
Huh?

668
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:01,121
Why is he telling you this ridiculous detail?

669
00:56:01,761 --> 00:56:04,080
Well, his right shoulder is lower than his left.

670
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:04,560
What is he?

671
00:56:04,721 --> 00:56:06,401
He's carrying a cross.

672
00:56:06,401 --> 00:56:07,761
That's what's happening.

673
00:56:07,761 --> 00:56:12,321
And he's just planting that there, and nobody's going to notice.

674
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:20,401
And he's putting Yvonne and Dmitri both together as two different versions of carrying a cross, and he's just throwaway.

675
00:56:22,721 --> 00:56:23,520
Period.

676
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:30,561
But now, so 500 pages later, he's ready to deal with it head on on 742.

677
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:33,760
74?

678
00:56:33,841 --> 00:56:35,681
I'm always on 616.

679
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,760
I've got different pages in here for a different version, different translation.

680
00:56:40,241 --> 00:56:42,000
I'll keep looking at the wrong ones.

681
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,681
6.16.

682
00:56:43,680 --> 00:57:00,281
So, just to show you that Yvonne also thinks in terms of crucifixion, he says he's going to go, I'm getting way ahead of where some of you are, but it's not going to affect the who done it part of the story.

683
00:57:00,921 --> 00:57:12,520
But Yvonne is going to go to the trial of Dimitri, and he's going to confess his responsibility for the death of old Karamat.

684
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:16,921
So, he says, tomorrow, the cross, not the gallows.

685
00:57:16,921 --> 00:57:23,880
Well, we don't know what I can't explain what that means, but that he sees what he's going to do at the trial as the crucifixion.

686
00:57:23,881 --> 00:57:26,200
So, he's got his own version of the cross.

687
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,881
That's the important thing.

688
00:57:28,441 --> 00:57:55,241
And Yvonne is going to suffer, he thinks, by confessing at the trial that his own selfish impulses, his specific evil desires, namely that old Karamat subject, get killed.

689
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:02,120
But Yvonne can't really take it.

690
00:58:02,921 --> 00:58:09,161
He wants to face his dark side, confess his involvement, so forth, suffer for it.

691
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:18,041
But instead, out of pride, he decides, he tries to punish himself and thereby show that he's better than everybody else.

692
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:31,000
Instead of seeing that he's as bad as everybody else, he has this funny move that if he sees and shows that he's as bad as everybody else, that makes him better than everybody else.

693
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,400
Because they aren't just seeing it and showing it.

694
00:58:33,401 --> 00:58:39,520
So he's turning his confession into a kind of, I'm better than you are.

695
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:41,281
You can see this on 188.

696
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:53,681
First, you see it in his telling Katerina something which applies to him because he can understand it because it's him too.

697
00:58:53,680 --> 00:59:00,880
He says at the top of 188, your life, Katerina, will be spent in painful brooding over your own feelings, your own heroism, and your own suffering.

698
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,120
But in the end, that suffering will be softened.

699
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:06,320
This is a kind of parody of what Zasma tells the peasant woman.

700
00:59:06,721 --> 00:59:14,400
But in the end, that suffering will be softened and will pass into contemplation of the fulfillment of a bold and proud design.

701
00:59:14,401 --> 00:59:15,280
See, this is proud.

702
00:59:15,281 --> 00:59:19,681
Yes, proud it certainly is, and desperate in any case, but a triumph for you.

703
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:26,641
And the consciousness of it will at last be a source of complete satisfaction and will make you resigned to everything else.

704
00:59:27,361 --> 00:59:34,561
It turns into a weird kind of joy to have managed to pull off this prideful thing.

705
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:39,840
And this is all part of this masochistic parody of true crucifixion.

706
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:49,921
He's telling Katerina that her prideful pain is going to be good for her.

707
00:59:51,040 --> 01:00:00,641
And I don't think I need to read this.

708
01:00:02,881 --> 01:00:05,441
No, no, I think not, just a second.

709
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:16,081
Well, just so you can see the connection, 249, I put it in here for something.

710
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:24,280
I mean, the Grand Inquisitor, remember I said, thinks of carrying the cross as this kind of masochistic suffering.

711
01:00:24,281 --> 01:00:26,840
So he says about 15 lines from the bottom.

712
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,760
They had borne their cross.

713
01:00:28,761 --> 01:00:33,640
They had endured scores of years in the barren, hungry wilderness, living on locusts and roots.

714
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:43,720
I mean, not, you know, confessing to their fellow human beings and going to prison and expiating their crimes and trying to fix the suffering in the world like Mother Teresa.

715
01:00:43,721 --> 01:00:48,041
They just go out and eat lots of ugly things, living on locusts and roots.

716
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:56,280
And thou mayest indeed point with pride at those children of freedom, of free love, of free and splendid sacrifice in thy name, and so forth.

717
01:00:56,281 --> 01:01:01,480
Well, that's the wrong view clearly presented by Yvonne.

718
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,000
He sees it in Katerina.

719
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,760
He sees it in the Grand Inquisitor.

720
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:07,081
And now we've got to see it in him.

721
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:16,681
So on 569, it's all got to do with his sense of involvement in the murder.

722
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:32,600
About 10 lines down, Alyasha is telling him, I only know one thing, Alyasha went on, still almost in a whisper.

723
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,601
It wasn't you killed father.

724
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,200
What do you mean, not you?

725
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,881
Yvonne was thunderstruck.

726
01:01:37,881 --> 01:01:41,160
It was not you who killed father, not you, Alyasha repeated.

727
01:01:41,801 --> 01:01:44,281
The silence lasted for half a minute.

728
01:01:44,281 --> 01:01:45,401
I know I didn't.

729
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:46,200
Are you raving?

730
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,601
said Yvonne, with a pale, distorted smile.

731
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,361
His eyes were riveted on Alyasha.

732
01:01:50,361 --> 01:01:52,281
They were standing under a lamppost.

733
01:01:52,281 --> 01:01:56,600
No, Yvonne, you told yourself several times that you're the murderer.

734
01:01:56,601 --> 01:02:00,601
And there's something else.

735
01:02:00,601 --> 01:02:01,320
Let's see.

736
01:02:01,481 --> 01:02:02,680
Let me skip a little.

737
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:09,280
He was speaking now, as it were, not of himself, not of his own will, but obeying some irresistible command.

738
01:02:07,881 --> 01:02:14,801
You have accused yourself and have confessed to yourself that you are the murderer and no one else, that you didn't do it.

739
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,000
You're mistaken.

740
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:16,961
You are not the murderer.

741
01:02:16,961 --> 01:02:17,520
Do you hear?

742
01:02:17,521 --> 01:02:18,560
It was not you.

743
01:02:18,561 --> 01:02:20,640
God has sent me to tell you.

744
01:02:20,881 --> 01:02:35,520
Where God always means, I think, just the connectedness, the power of the true connectedness is what makes Alyaka able to see these things and say these things that other people can't see and say.

745
01:02:41,921 --> 01:02:53,680
And after that, Yvonne, who you know can't ever face anybody who sees anything wrong with him, and he thinks, it's so weird, I realize.

746
01:02:53,681 --> 01:03:02,560
Yvonne wants to take on the crime just to show that he's better than anybody else because he at least admits that he did it.

747
01:03:02,801 --> 01:03:06,881
And so Alyasha is sort of throwing cold water on this plan of Yvonne.

748
01:03:06,961 --> 01:03:22,160
So at the top of 570, in the second paragraph, as soon as Alyasha's told him this, he says, Alyasha, he said with a cold smile, I can't endure prophets and epileptics, messengers from God especially, and you know that only too well.

749
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,240
I don't want to see you again from this moment on.

750
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,360
Leave me at this turning.

751
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
It's the way to your rooms.

752
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
You don't come to see me tonight.

753
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:30,801
So forth.

754
01:03:30,801 --> 01:03:33,040
So that he breaks with Alyasha.

755
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:37,120
And now all kinds of interesting things happen to Yvonne.

756
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:50,720
But first, just to show you that he wants to confess, because he wants to show that he's the aloof, perfect judge of himself and everybody else in the universe.

757
01:03:51,360 --> 01:04:05,801
It's on page 586, about ten lines down.

758
01:04:05,801 --> 01:04:11,160
He decided to sacrifice 30,000 on arranging Dimitri's escape.

759
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:15,560
On his return from seeing him, he was very mournful and dispirited.

760
01:04:15,561 --> 01:04:24,680
He suddenly began to feel that he was anxious for Dimitri's escape, not only to heal that so replaced by sacrificing 30,000, but for other reasons.

761
01:04:24,681 --> 01:04:26,761
It's because I am as much a murderer.

762
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,160
Is it because I'm as much a murderer at heart?

763
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,360
He asked himself.

764
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:34,040
Something very deep down seemed burning and rankling in his soul.

765
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:36,200
His pride above all suffered cruelly.

766
01:04:36,841 --> 01:04:39,000
He's got this complicated pride.

767
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,320
One, he doesn't want to think that he's like Dimitri, a murderer.

768
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:49,881
Two, he wants to think, yes, he's a murderer, but he's such a generous murderer that he's going to confess it.

769
01:04:49,881 --> 01:04:58,921
You'll see in a minute that the devil, who knows exactly what's going on, tells him that on 599, maybe.

770
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,680
I owe you a quote.

771
01:05:00,921 --> 01:05:05,961
This kind of funny reversal that he's doing in his head.

772
01:05:09,481 --> 01:05:18,681
Well, just the first paragraph of section 9 on 599, he's going to justify himself to himself, it says at the end of the paragraph.

773
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:20,921
That's what he has to do, he thinks.

774
01:05:20,921 --> 01:05:24,440
But that's not still the best quote for it.

775
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:27,720
Christ 6.18.

776
01:05:27,721 --> 01:05:29,400
Now that's what the devil tells him.

777
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:34,440
And the devil says the right thing to him.

778
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:39,360
I'm going to talk next time about Yvonne's whole encounter with the devil.

779
01:05:39,921 --> 01:05:45,280
But just the devil is very smart about Yvonne for reasons that we'll see when you get there.

780
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:49,600
But then he says, at the bottom of 6.17, you are going from pride, he says.

781
01:05:49,601 --> 01:05:52,400
You'll stand up and say, it was I that killed him.

782
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,240
And why do you writhe with horror?

783
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,040
You are lying.

784
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:56,320
I despise your opinion.

785
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,841
I despise your horror.

786
01:05:57,841 --> 01:05:59,120
He said that about me.

787
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:00,801
The devil said that about Yvonne.

788
01:06:00,801 --> 01:06:02,961
And do you know you are long, now the devil again?

789
01:06:02,961 --> 01:06:05,360
And do you know you are longing for praise?

790
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,520
Quote, he's a criminal, a murderer.

791
01:06:07,521 --> 01:06:08,881
But what nobility?

792
01:06:08,881 --> 01:06:12,240
He wanted to save his brother, and he confessed.

793
01:06:12,641 --> 01:06:17,600
And so that's his convoluted motives in all this.

794
01:06:18,561 --> 01:06:30,480
And he's also jealous of Dimitri because Dimitri can accept his crime, not out of pride, but out of proper humility.

795
01:06:30,481 --> 01:06:33,921
That's his way on 7.14, way, way at the end.

796
01:06:33,921 --> 01:06:34,801
It doesn't matter.

797
01:06:34,801 --> 01:06:36,720
He doesn't give away anything.

798
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,360
This is Katerina explaining what's going on in Yvonne's crazy head.

799
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:46,080
He talked about, first full paragraph.

800
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:48,160
He talked about some hymn.

801
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:54,961
He went on, some hymn she went on again, some cross he has to bear, some duty.

802
01:06:54,961 --> 01:06:58,480
I remember Yvonne told me a great deal about it.

803
01:06:58,801 --> 01:07:04,961
And if you knew how he taught, Katerina cried suddenly with feelings she could not repress.

804
01:07:04,961 --> 01:07:14,640
If you only knew how he loved that wretched man at the moment and how he hated him at the same time, that's because he both knows how to suffer and not know.

805
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,561
Dimitri knows how to suffer.

806
01:07:16,561 --> 01:07:18,400
Yvonne can't get it right.

807
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:22,400
But they're both trying to get the right suffering for this crime.

808
01:07:22,681 --> 01:07:30,040
So Dmitry could turn it into joy by confessing and asking forgiveness, humbling himself, and so forth.

809
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:40,520
But Yvonne, back to lacerations, only creates more suffering because he's got into this state of saying he wants to spit in the faces of the jurors.

810
01:07:40,521 --> 01:07:41,160
I haven't read that.

811
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,680
It will come across that.

812
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:48,440
Now, I want to say one more thing, because it's such a funny kind of thing.

813
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:49,720
I'll leave you with that.

814
01:07:50,681 --> 01:07:59,720
We're going to go back now to where Yvonne is on his way to see Shmerzhakov, and something really weird happens.

815
01:07:59,721 --> 01:08:01,961
This is not typical Dostoevsky.

816
01:08:01,961 --> 01:08:04,681
This is so bizarre that even Dostoevsky wouldn't come.

817
01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:07,160
It's the wrong kind of bizarre, maybe, but it's interesting.

818
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:09,561
Ivan suddenly came upon a drunken peasant.

819
01:08:09,561 --> 01:08:10,520
He's walking along.

820
01:08:10,521 --> 01:08:15,640
He was wearing a coarse patched coat and was walking zigzag, grumbling, and swearing to himself.

821
01:08:15,641 --> 01:08:21,000
Then suddenly he began singing in a husky, drunken voice: Ah, Vanka's gone to Petersburg.

822
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,400
I won't wait till he comes back.

823
01:08:23,881 --> 01:08:25,881
You cipher that?

824
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:28,600
Why does that upset Yvonne so much?

825
01:08:29,561 --> 01:08:31,560
It's really, really weird.

826
01:08:31,881 --> 01:08:35,640
The peasant is singing, in fact, go ahead.

827
01:08:35,961 --> 01:08:37,961
Yes, but why this particular thing?

828
01:08:37,961 --> 01:08:41,000
I mean, what's so striking about what the peasant is singing?

829
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,160
Why does it apply to Yvonne?

830
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:46,440
Yes.

831
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:55,641
One, Yvonne went to Moscow, so one plan has it, and leaves so that Dmitry could murder old Karamatsov.

832
01:08:55,641 --> 01:08:59,801
That's got translated into gone to Petersburg and I won't wait till he comes back.

833
01:08:59,801 --> 01:09:00,921
But who's Vanka?

834
01:09:00,921 --> 01:09:02,760
That's the funny part.

835
01:09:02,761 --> 01:09:06,360
Isn't Vanka a nicknamed for Yvonne on that handout?

836
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:08,080
Okay, so there, it's right on.

837
01:09:07,801 --> 01:09:08,801
I mean, I don't know.

838
01:09:08,961 --> 01:09:16,881
I mean, I think Dostoevsky, who was usually a realist, who really pushed it a bit there, but the peasant is actually singing the guilt of Yvonne.

839
01:09:16,881 --> 01:09:20,320
And of course, Yvonne is very, very annoyed about that.

840
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,480
I'm just going to finish this paragraph.

841
01:09:22,801 --> 01:09:26,240
Yvonne felt an intense hatred for him before he had thought about him.

842
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:29,440
He realized his presence and he knocked him down.

843
01:09:29,921 --> 01:09:31,520
He had an impulse to knock him down.

844
01:09:31,521 --> 01:09:37,440
At that moment, they met, and the peasant, with a violent lurch, fell against Yvonne, who pushed him back furiously.

845
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,921
And he gave an oof and he fall to the ground.

846
01:09:39,921 --> 01:09:41,520
And Yvonne stepped up to him.

847
01:09:41,521 --> 01:09:43,921
He was lying on his back, unconscious.

848
01:09:43,921 --> 01:09:48,320
He will freeze to death, thought Yvonne, and he went on his way to Smersh.

849
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:56,000
Now, that's sort of a chance he had to do something good.

850
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:08,320
And it's just one more thing that when it reminds him of his guilt, he gets in, he feels, he resists doing anything about it.

851
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:14,160
But let me just try a tiny bit more, because I will finish a kind of unit here.

852
01:10:14,481 --> 01:10:18,961
So he's left him lying on the ground on 587.

853
01:10:19,601 --> 01:10:27,120
And suddenly he feels on 598 a desire to confess.

854
01:10:29,521 --> 01:10:39,360
And all of a sudden, for, we'll see how long, Yvonne is in the saved, it looks like he's in a savable dimension.

855
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,000
The snowstorm, the middle of 598.

856
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,520
The snowstorm was still raging.

857
01:10:43,521 --> 01:10:47,040
He walked the first few steps boldly, but suddenly he began staggering.

858
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,120
It's something physical, he thought, with a grin.

859
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,440
Something like joy was springing up in his heart.

860
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,721
He was conscious of unbounded resolution.

861
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:57,160
He would make an end to this wavering that had so tortured him of late.

862
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:02,120
His determination was taken, and now it will not be changed, he thought with relief.

863
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,841
At that moment, he stumbled against something and almost fell down.

864
01:11:04,841 --> 01:11:10,440
Stopping short, he saw at his feet the peasant who he had knocked down, still lying unconscious and motionless.

865
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,921
The snow had almost covered his face.

866
01:11:12,921 --> 01:11:14,841
Yvonne lifted him in his arms.

867
01:11:14,841 --> 01:11:15,961
Can you believe it?

868
01:11:15,961 --> 01:11:20,120
He's never touched another human being in the course of the book, as far as I know.

869
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:27,160
And now he's got his arms around, and he's practically hugging and carrying the unconscious peasant.

870
01:11:27,481 --> 01:11:37,160
And it looks like, and he's going to go confess, really confess, not out of pride, but out of trying to suffer for what he did that was wrong, in the right way.

871
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:40,120
But, this is the last comment, it doesn't last.

872
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:47,961
Just as he reached his own house, he stopped short, asking himself suddenly if he'd better not go at once to the prosecutor and tell him.

873
01:11:47,961 --> 01:11:50,120
He decided the question quickly.

874
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:53,560
Everything together tomorrow, he whispered to himself.

875
01:11:53,561 --> 01:11:59,480
And strange to say, almost all his gladness and self-satisfaction passed in an instant.

876
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:12,921
As he entered his room, he felt something like a touch of ice on his heart, like a recollection, or more exactly, a reminder of something agonizing and revolting that was in the room at that moment and had been there before.

877
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:13,801
Who's that?

878
01:12:13,801 --> 01:12:16,200
Anybody read far enough to know?

879
01:12:16,521 --> 01:12:17,801
That's the devil.

880
01:12:17,801 --> 01:12:25,080
I mean, and why is it that he suddenly lost his resolution to confess?

881
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:33,240
Because Dostoevsky has the idea that you can only do it impulsively, because otherwise all your bad character will take over.

882
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:39,681
And he had this impulsive moment when he was going to go and confess right away to the police, and then he thought, wait till tomorrow.

883
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,440
As soon as he thought, wait till tomorrow, he lost his momentum.

884
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,200
He's not going to confess.

885
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:52,881
In fact, he's going to go into a very bad direction next time because he gets to see the devil.
