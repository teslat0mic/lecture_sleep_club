1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,879
Okay, now I'm going back to the basic issues that we were having in the background while we were doing talking about the film.

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:25,200
So let's just, and they are restated in a sort of more Hegelian language, which is unfortunately not the language that you guys speak, or me either.

3
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:33,040
But I'll translate them into common sense talk on 97 at the beginning of problem two.

4
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:42,239
So we're going to hear again about the ethical and the suspension of the ethical and the way to go against the ethical.

5
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:59,520
And it says at the beginning of the first full paragraph: in the ethical view of life, then, it is, and now I've got to go through this complicated, crazy thing of putting all these individuals and particulars back into the way they should be.

6
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,800
Not in the way they should be in Kierkegaard, because I said there's only one word in Danish for the individual and the particular.

7
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:21,200
I don't know how he and his readers understood it, but I can make it easier for you if you just do what I say and cross out the word, put in the words particular and individual where they belong.

8
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,359
So I'm going to do that as I read.

9
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,159
In the ethical view of life, then it is the particulars tense.

10
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,360
You understand why.

11
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,160
I don't do this just dumbly and blindly.

12
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,560
Particulars are just any old people, or even, as I say, dogs or briefcases.

13
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:40,239
They're all particulars.

14
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:45,479
But then there's this special thing that Kierkegaard wants to single out, namely an individual.

15
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:50,839
And an individual is somebody who has an identity by way of having an unconditional commitment.

16
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:54,920
So it obviously isn't individual in that sense.

17
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:03,640
It's the particular's task to divest himself of the determinant of interiority and give it expression in the exterior.

18
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,320
Well, that's code.

19
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,239
We know interiority under a different name already.

20
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,640
It's the lower immediacy.

21
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,320
So he's supposed to get rid of lower immediacy and give it an expression in the exterior.

22
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,359
That means mediation.

23
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,320
The interiority is all your moods and feelings and private stuff.

24
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:31,479
And the exterior is the public language which you share with everybody else.

25
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:54,599
Now, whenever the particular shrinks from doing so, that is, getting mediated, whenever he wants to stay inside or slip back into the inner determinant of feeling, mood, etc., he commits an offense and he is in a state of temptation that he's given in to going down from the ethical to lower immediacy.

26
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:06,839
The paradox of faith is this: that there is an interiority, that's an immediacy, that is incommensurable with the exterior, that, in other words, can't be made intelligible.

27
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:11,640
An interiority, which, it should be stressed, is not identical with the first.

28
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,159
The first interiority is lower immediacy, which is that of the child.

29
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:21,799
Remember, I said, so you think of the immediate is where you start.

30
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,839
But it's a new interiority.

31
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:34,560
Now, I'll ask you: what's the name we had for that in the preliminary whatever you call it, the preamble from the heart?

32
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:44,080
What is it that you've got that isn't immediacy and it isn't mediation either, but something you get after both of those?

33
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,680
Remember the name?

34
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,959
Yes, good.

35
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:47,999
Who said it?

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,320
Good.

37
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,359
Higher immediacy.

38
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,400
That's what he's talking about.

39
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:51,999
Everything's just got a new name.

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,520
It is not identical with the first, but is a new interiority.

41
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,839
That's the higher immediacy.

42
00:03:58,559 --> 00:04:00,000
This must not be overlooked.

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Recent philosophy, that's Hegel, has allowed itself without further ado to substitute the immediate for faith.

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,880
That is, faith is just lumped together with all the other private feelings that you have and that kids have.

45
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,039
And in Hegel, he's only got two categories for this.

46
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:23,999
There's either immediacy or there's mediation.

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,600
There's a third something or other, but you don't have to think about it.

48
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:29,680
And it's not higher immediacy.

49
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:33,680
There's no such thing in Hegel as higher immediacy.

50
00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:37,759
So faith is higher immediacy.

51
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:48,320
You can see it better if you go back to 84, where he introduces these issues.

52
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:50,640
And I'll read you just two places there.

53
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:59,760
It's the same point, but in this, and pretty clear here, with a few mixed up particulars and all that.

54
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:06,879
On 84, for faith is just this paradox that the individual, single doesn't help any, right?

55
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,239
Just cross it out.

56
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,520
Really, you should write the individual probably with a capital I, because for Kierkegaard, that's a big deal.

57
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:23,080
For faith, it's just this paradox that the individual is higher than the universal, though in such a way be it noted that the movement is repeated.

58
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:37,399
That is, that having been in the universal, the particular now, the particular now sets himself apart as the individual above the universal.

59
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:39,559
See, the particular couldn't be above the universal.

60
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,000
I'd be nonsense.

61
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:49,880
If that is not faith, then Abraham is done for, and faith has never existed in the world just because it's always existed.

62
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:57,959
I think we went through that little puzzle once before, a few lectures back, but it's such a funny thing that we have to do it again.

63
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:05,879
Why would it be true if we followed Hegel that faith never existed because it always existed?

64
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,959
You should be able to say that.

65
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,320
Somebody should.

66
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,479
I'm sure we did discuss it once, didn't we?

67
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,000
Or am I imagining things?

68
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,800
We did.

69
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:15,240
Okay, then.

70
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,280
So faith has never existed because it's always existed.

71
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,879
Well, let me read you another quote before I tell you, and maybe you'll see there.

72
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,520
The bottom of 84.

73
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:38,360
Faith is just this paradox that the individual, as the individual, is higher than the universal, is justified before the latter, not as subordinate, but a superior.

74
00:06:38,360 --> 00:07:03,360
Though in such a way be it noted that it is the particular who, having been subordinate to the universal as the particular, now, by means of the universal, by going through it, that is, becomes the individual who, as the individual, stands in absolute relation to the absolute, that is, has an unconditional commitment.

75
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,239
Now let's go on.

76
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:05,760
We're going to get back to this funny phrase.

77
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,960
This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation occurs by virtue of the universal.

78
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,120
And it remains in all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought.

79
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,039
And yet faith is this paradox.

80
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,960
And now comes the puzzle again.

81
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:26,640
Or else, these are implications which I would ask the reader always to bear in mind, though it would be too complicated for me to spell them out each time.

82
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:32,880
Or else faith has never existed just because it's always existed and Abraham is done for.

83
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,520
What would it mean?

84
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,159
What does Hegel think faith is, we just saw earlier?

85
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,080
The interior and lower immediacy.

86
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:46,240
Has that always existed?

87
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,120
The childish, the moods, the private stuff?

88
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,720
It's always existed.

89
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,160
Well, if faith is lower immediacy, then faith has always existed.

90
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,560
But has anything like what Kierkegaard means by faith ever existed?

91
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:06,560
No, because faith gets just lumped with all this lower immediacy stuff.

92
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:19,520
And if faith is higher immediacy, this special unconditional commitment, and if you've got no place in your philosophy, but either lower immediacy or mediation, then faith gets lumped with lower immediacy.

93
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:29,039
And what Kierkegaard means by faith, where you're an individual, never existed because it just got lumped with everything else that always existed.

94
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,480
You got it now?

95
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,760
Is it okay?

96
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:39,920
I mean, if you don't get it, then you've got to keep sort of thinking about it until you do, because it's something that's pretty simple.

97
00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:43,520
He's just putting it in this sort of tricky, complicated way.

98
00:08:44,840 --> 00:09:01,399
And what's important isn't a fancy way, but that, according to Kierkegaard, there is something, I'll see coming back to this, something absolutely crucial that people can do but they can't understand.

99
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,280
We've seen it once so far.

100
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:14,040
What is the knight of faith in the preamble from the heart able to do that people, including himself or herself, can't understand?

101
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Well, it's to see the sword hanging over the head of the beloved, and instead of having defenses by trying to keep from getting involved or by having making the movements of resignation if you are involved, you try to defend yourself that way, sensibly, against the vulnerability.

102
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:47,559
The thing that you do that you can't understand if you're a knight of faith is get more and more involved, seeing the sword hanging over the head of the beloved, and yet getting more and more involved as if it was the surest and safest thing of all.

103
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,760
From pure rational intelligibleness, that makes no sense at all.

104
00:09:52,760 --> 00:10:01,960
That's an absolutely stupid thing to do, to make the whole meaning of your life and happiness depend on this vulnerable relationship.

105
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,520
And that's the first one.

106
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:19,399
But now, remember, and this is all just getting it all back in your memory, that we've switched from the issue about the vulnerability of the person you love, where Isaac was an example of that.

107
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:22,040
And now Isaac is the ethical.

108
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:35,520
And because Abraham is both going to lose Isaac, that is, he's got to resign himself to the fact that Isaac might be dead, the fact that Abraham has to do it just complicates things in a way we don't have to think about and don't need to think about.

109
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:43,520
That's just Kierkegaard getting wound up in his breaking his engagement with Rudina, and that just makes things confusing.

110
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:56,319
The main thing is, Abraham sees that Isaac is vulnerable, and Abraham goes on without a ruffle, unruffled, getting involved with Isaac and letting the whole meaning of his life depend on it.

111
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,080
Now, suppose Isaac is the ethical instead of the object of a divining commitment.

112
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:09,120
Well, then now we have to think of Abraham as killing Isaac.

113
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,559
And if Abraham is killing Isaac, then Abraham's a murderer.

114
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:20,240
It doesn't really matter anymore whether it's Isaac, that is his defining commitment he's killing.

115
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,159
If Abraham were killing anybody, he'd be a murderer.

116
00:11:24,159 --> 00:12:01,440
And the idea that Abraham is somehow doing this completely unethical thing and somehow feeling at the same time that that's what he really has to do, that it's the best thing he could do, that he could feel that and thereby do this mysterious thing of going against the ethical while feeling justified, but utterly unable to explain how what he's doing could possibly be justified.

117
00:12:01,439 --> 00:12:27,799
I gave you an example, remember, of the person who was homosexual in Denmark, in Copenhagen in 1850, feeling that their love of whoever is the best thing in their life and gives their world meaning and gives them an identity, and feeling that it is an absolutely unethical, unethical, despicable, depraved, disgusting, unnatural, whatever thing to do.

118
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:35,240
I give you another example because for the whole ethical story, you've got to keep this is the puzzle.

119
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,960
So let's do this.

120
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:43,000
The puzzle is to do something that you can't understand, but yet feel called upon to do.

121
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:49,080
It seems to be the right thing to do, but when you try to explain it, it turns out to be the wrong thing to do.

122
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:55,640
That got it with killing somebody, Abraham's killing Isaac, you get it with the homosexual story.

123
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,040
Take this, another example.

124
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:04,520
Suppose some kid, I don't think I said this, about kids raised in Germany from the time they were born.

125
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:11,479
So the Third Reich, the Nazis lasted something like, I think, 13 years, right?

126
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:34,040
Roughly, anyway, long enough that some kid could be born under the Nazis and raised and educated under the Nazis so as to believe that Jews were just the biggest threat to civilization and inferior and dangerous, and it was every good person's duty to turn them in and get them exterminated.

127
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:51,960
And now, suppose this kid, well, suppose he's 13, gets to like or falls in love with, doesn't, and now we leave out homosexual, falls in love with a girl if it's, let's say he's a guy, a boy kid, and this is the most wonderful, important thing in his life.

128
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,280
But turns out she's Jewish.

129
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:57,720
Now it's his duty to turn her in.

130
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,959
It's intelligible.

131
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:04,880
It's the heroic, the Aryan, the human, the rational, the ethical thing to do.

132
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,360
He's never heard of anything else.

133
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,160
And, but he feels that this is the best thing that ever happened to him.

134
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:13,600
So he doesn't turn her in.

135
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,800
He hides her.

136
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:24,640
Well, when he hides her, he does something which he feels is absolutely justified and absolutely wrong at the same time.

137
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,440
And there's no way he can explain it to himself.

138
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:32,559
It's inconceivable that you could have sex with somebody of the same sex.

139
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:40,880
It's inconceivable that you could protect one of these awful subhuman creatures.

140
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,680
And yet, this person does it.

141
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:48,160
And now I want to say again, does it even though they can't understand what they're doing?

142
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:55,200
But they do it because they feel that it is exactly the best thing they've ever done.

143
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,000
And you could make up other such stories, I'm sure.

144
00:14:58,319 --> 00:15:07,680
And it's always important not to say to yourself, Kierkegaard talks about this, well, in the end, it'll turn out to be all right.

145
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,919
Abraham, after all, didn't kill Isaac.

146
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,279
So it must have been all, whatever Abraham did, it was terrific.

147
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:25,919
And the Nazis got rid of the Nazis and re-educated the kids, and they understood that everything they had, the guy who hid the girl understood now with great relief that it was the right thing to do.

148
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:34,399
And so, and we've now we're in Berkeley in 2006, and we don't think that it's depraved to be gay anymore.

149
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,079
But as Kierkegaard keeps saying, that is irrelevant.

150
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,919
It's not important how it turned out with Abraham, whether he killed Isaac or not.

151
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:49,799
He was a murderer in the sense that you're a murderer if you go around trying to stab somebody with an intent to kill them.

152
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:59,399
Whether some angel comes and stops you at the last minute or not, doesn't make you any less of a murderer from within it, from when you're doing it.

153
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,319
And you have to think about the how.

154
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:14,279
This is this existential thing, not from the point of view of some us looking on from Berkeley or for some rational perspective, but how it was to the person doing it.

155
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:23,959
And no matter how it turned out, whether the Nazis lost out and the gay won out and then the ram got killed instead of Isaac, that's irrelevant.

156
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,720
What we want to understand is the state of mind of the person doing it.

157
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,359
And they're doing something they can't understand.

158
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:31,640
That's paradoxical.

159
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:38,520
They're doing something that they absolutely shouldn't do, and they can't understand how they could possibly be doing it.

160
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:44,359
And yet it seems the thing they ought to do, have to do, should do, and so forth.

161
00:16:44,359 --> 00:16:44,920
Yeah.

162
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,559
Of Romeo and Juliet, not quite, but I mean, I think it's important to see why not.

163
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:58,679
And why not?

164
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,720
Well, I think I'm just, it's a good issue.

165
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,360
You understand?

166
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:06,359
I mean, she's asking, could you do a story like this about Romeo and Juliet?

167
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:12,439
Here they are loving each other, protecting each other, hiding from their families who hate each other.

168
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:18,599
And it's sort of inconceivable that the capulets and the, who are the other guys?

169
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:24,119
Montagues could ever get together and sort of bless this wedding.

170
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,079
But I don't think it's inconceivable enough.

171
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:38,240
I mean, it doesn't seem, it seems like, well, if only we could talk to them and convince them, and of course, after a lot of suffering at the end, they do get together.

172
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,679
But that's not, that's looking back from the end again.

173
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,599
Well, it's all about what you hear in inconceivable.

174
00:17:45,599 --> 00:18:07,119
I mean, I don't think it's as inconceivable that the capulets and Montagues get together as that to a Nazi kid, you save a Jew or to a gay person, you get applauded, or at least you're accepted as a perfectly fine member of the community.

175
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:14,319
But I don't know how to, I mean, it's a nice question, because I mean, it really says to me, the fine inconceivable, and I can't.

176
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:16,079
I've got an intuition about it.

177
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:18,000
I've got examples of it.

178
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,920
And you're on a borderline.

179
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,920
You have to tell more and more of the story.

180
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,520
But I'm afraid the more you told, the more you discover that it doesn't work very well.

181
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,039
Because these people are all part of a community, the capulets and the Montagues, which have so much in common.

182
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,799
That's maybe what's important.

183
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:47,199
Unlike the Jews and the Nazis or the gays hidden in the closets in Copenhagen and the straight married people who really have no common language to discuss those issues.

184
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,279
It's incommunicable.

185
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:02,720
It transcends, you know, am I saying it transcends language is an incommunicable?

186
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,319
Yes, let's go into that.

187
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:18,520
Yes, it transcends the intelligibility, which is the ethical, which is a language in which you determine, you talk, you have words for what's right and wrong, words for what's worthy and not worthy.

188
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:30,359
There isn't any language for homosexual that isn't a language already totally disparaging and saying it's unworthy in 1850 Denmark.

189
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:47,159
And that's, so in Kierkegaard's way of talking, and I think it's right, if there is something all outside the ethical, really outside it, you won't have any language in which to describe it except as bad.

190
00:19:47,639 --> 00:19:53,640
And or maybe just you will have no language and it'll just be neutral.

191
00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:55,159
You just have no name for it.

192
00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:05,879
But what you can't do is find a language in which you can describe in a neutral way what all the words in the ethical tell you is unworthy.

193
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:07,559
That's his idea.

194
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:08,520
I think it's a good idea.

195
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,279
I think it's probably right.

196
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,240
So, anything else?

197
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:20,199
Okay, this is all background in a way, getting ready to go further, but it's hard and interesting stuff.

198
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:34,039
Let me see now where I am.

199
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:50,199
So, another way to put it is for Hegel, any way of going against the universal is thinning, and faith requires you to go against the universal because there's a higher authority in your life.

200
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,199
So, faith is thinning.

201
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,799
And then you get, that is, or another way to put it, faith is making an exception of yourself.

202
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,199
And that's always non-ethical.

203
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:02,879
Ethical is always universal.

204
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,240
You're supposed to do what any rational, good person does.

205
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,240
All of that's the same point.

206
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:15,039
And if the only way, I've got another way to put this, this funny paradox-like thing.

207
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:30,159
If the only way to make an exception of yourself were to leave the universal and act as a particular, telling lies, stealing things, whatever, then faith would never have existed because it would always have existed.

208
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:38,879
Because faith is just another way of leaving the universal, of leaving, would be just another way of leaving the universal and making an exception of yourself.

209
00:21:38,879 --> 00:21:44,720
And if you've got no distinction between high exceptions and low exceptions, they all look the same.

210
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,599
I'm just saying the same thing again.

211
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,359
Making an exception of yourself is going down to lower immediacy.

212
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:58,240
If you've only got philosophical categories, there's no other way you can see it.

213
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,680
And I'll lead you where he's...

214
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,439
Yeah, I've read that.

215
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:05,439
That's my version of the top of 85, which I was reading.

216
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,279
But now I'm going to change the subject.

217
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,679
That's pretty much a review.

218
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:25,439
But now, we want to know, well, how do you tell when somebody is making an exception of themselves and going against the ethical whether what they're doing is lower immediacy or higher immediacy?

219
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,799
That's a puzzle.

220
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:35,199
You don't want to just get every crazy person who goes against the ethical and makes an exception of themselves put together.

221
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:40,959
You want to be able to tell an unconditional commitment from a temptation.

222
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:54,439
And so on 90, Kierkegaard is saying, or DeSalentio is saying, you better have some kind of criterions by which you can tell the bottom of 90.

223
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:04,199
So when the single individual is in absolute relation to the absolute, toward the bottom, is he justified?

224
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,879
His justification is, once again, the paradox.

225
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:15,080
For if he is, the paradox is not by virtue of being anything universal, but by being the individual.

226
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:16,439
We're back to that.

227
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:21,559
How does the individual assure himself that he's justified?

228
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,760
That's a big problem.

229
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:29,959
And Kierkegaard has lots of interesting things to say about it.

230
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,000
But let's sort of get, we need some examples first.

231
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:40,680
How are we going to rule out as lower immediacy examples like M.

232
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,520
I think I did mention M, didn't I?

233
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,480
Maybe briefly?

234
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:43,960
Briefly.

235
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,240
M is this wonderful movie.

236
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,400
Anybody seen M since I recommended it?

237
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,480
Or you've seen it already, anyway.

238
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:59,000
Peter Laurie playing this wonderful role of this guy who has this total compulsion to kill little girls, and he certainly doesn't want to do it.

239
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:07,320
And whenever he sees a little girl, he sort of goes away and sits in a cafe and tries to drink brandy and read the newspaper and get his mind on something else.

240
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:11,159
But sooner or later he just can't resist going out and killing her.

241
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:13,720
And he feels very sorry for himself.

242
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,680
Everybody else treats him like a monster, but he thinks they should have sympathy for him.

243
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,119
He can't help it.

244
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:23,960
And then there are some of these movies that you might want to see.

245
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:27,079
Nobody's probably ever heard of a movie Bigger Than Life.

246
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,520
It was not a big success.

247
00:24:28,879 --> 00:24:39,520
In it, I think it was James Mason, played a guy who goes crazy from reading too much Kierkegaard while taking too much cortisone or something.

248
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:46,320
I thought some drug that oversensitizes him to Kierkegaard.

249
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,639
And he says he tries to kill his son.

250
00:24:48,639 --> 00:24:51,199
And there's all kinds of complications.

251
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:59,520
And then there are people who go crazy and try to kill themselves without reading Kierkegaard, I think, like Jack Nicholson in The Shining.

252
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,039
There's no evidence, is there, that he got this way from reading Kierkegaard.

253
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,879
It's those spooky people who put him up to it.

254
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,919
But in all those cases, those people are certainly going against the ethical.

255
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:14,959
And you want to be able to say they don't count.

256
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,079
They really are in lower immediacy.

257
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,279
And what's the difference?

258
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:27,199
Well, the difference is they are compelled, each of them, to do what they do.

259
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,360
That is, they can't resist.

260
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:33,039
I mean, Peter Laurie and Am is the best example, and it's also the best movie.

261
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:40,799
That's the one I would put in the Course if I had time to show somebody compelled into lower immediacy.

262
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,599
But you can wonder about anybody.

263
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:52,240
There's this famous thing that Luther said when he quit the Catholic Church and set up Protestantism, Lutheranism.

264
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,119
Here I stand, I can do no other.

265
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,720
That's very ambiguous.

266
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,679
I mean, so does Peter Laurie say that, and James Mason and Jack Nicholson would.

267
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:11,599
Of course, Luther doesn't mean I'm just compelled to go around saying nasty things about the Pope and putting up 14 objections to the Catholic Church on the church door.

268
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:21,240
He means I, being Luther, following my unconditional commitment, am called to do this the way Abraham is called to kill Isaac.

269
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:28,439
I'm called to go against everything that I've been brought up to love and respect and have authority and so forth.

270
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,520
So the question is: the difference, but what's how do you get the difference?

271
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,319
Well, it's pretty straightforward.

272
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:40,839
If you can't resist it, if that's what I can do with no other means, it's a compulsion.

273
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:43,959
And if it's a compulsion, it's lower immediacy.

274
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:53,000
The basic condition before you can sort of get off the ground in this is that you have to be free not to do it.

275
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:57,480
So Abraham, to go back, is free not to kill Isaac.

276
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,639
At any moment, he can turn back.

277
00:26:59,639 --> 00:27:05,879
And say it was a temptation and return to the ethical and do what good fathers do.

278
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:13,160
So the gay person can always turn back and say, this has been a terrible, disgusting thing, and I will never do it again.

279
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,559
I'll get married and live happily ever after.

280
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:22,520
I take it to Broke Back Mountain, which I still haven't had a time to see movie is all about this and timely for the course.

281
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:33,799
But these people are free to go to turn against what it is their unconditional commitment is calling them to do against the ethical.

282
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:37,319
Of course, they won't be knights of faith suspending the ethical then.

283
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:42,039
They will be normal people giving into the temptation of the ethical.

284
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:45,560
But the main thing for this is that they must be free.

285
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:47,559
So that's on 139.

286
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:51,079
That's not in your reading, but that's the only place I know where he says it.

287
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:54,760
So at the top of 139, Abraham can refrain at any moment.

288
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,399
He can repent the whole thing as a temptation.

289
00:27:57,400 --> 00:29:36,359
Then he can speak then all will understand him but then he would no longer be but then he is no longer Abraham Abraham cannot speak that's sort of an answer to your point what here yeah what's your reading in Elizabeth's point I mean cannot speak because in the ethical language there is no way for Abraham to say anything but I'm murdering Isaac yeah what is what a non-what person a not crazy person who kills somebody well there's several possibilities good question one way is of course lots of not crazy people kill people Rathkolikov would be a good example I mean he's got his reasons he thinks that he's better than everybody and higher than the ethical and we'll have to see what to do about him in a minute but he's the kind of person you have in mind I think that and there's Charles Manson I have a list of non of seemingly non-crazy people who kill people and otherwise there are of course non-crazy people like Agamemnon who kill people one reason for killing people is that there's a higher ethical that says that if in his case the king has to save the country and go to war but you might kill somebody for instance if you thought that if you didn't they would kill lots of other people so forth so there's you can kill people in the name of a higher ethical but what about people who kill people and uh just do it because they think that's they can do it, get away with it.

290
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:38,199
They think they're an exception.

291
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,599
Well, that's another criterion we have to get to.

292
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:41,799
So they're free.

293
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:49,159
We're assuming that Raskolnikov and Manson were perfectly free not to go around killing people.

294
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,559
Oh, and so what happens then?

295
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:53,960
Okay, we need more criteria.

296
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,000
That's what you're saying.

297
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,119
That's good.

298
00:29:56,119 --> 00:30:02,520
And so I think I already read 85 where he says we need the criteria, but maybe I didn't.

299
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,279
Not I will read it now.

300
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:14,039
At the middle of 185, he says, while those who do not have faith should be prepared to offer some criterion for distinguishing the paradox from a temptation.

301
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:22,520
That's so interesting, because 90% of the readers who manage to understand this book at all, in spite of the craziness of it, yeah.

302
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,200
Oh, sorry, good point.

303
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,919
I knew you had something important to say by the look on your face.

304
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,279
Yes, page 85 is where I'm in.

305
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:33,559
I'm in the middle of it.

306
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:34,680
There we are.

307
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:42,520
While those who have faith should be prepared to offer some criterion for distinguishing the paradox from a temptation, that's right.

308
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,119
Obviously, one and better.

309
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:48,199
And we're going to try to do it now.

310
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:59,400
Otherwise, we're going to end up having to conclude really weird people like Raskolnikov is the best because he's clearly not under any compulsion and he's clearly not crazy.

311
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:01,879
So what how do we deal with it?

312
00:31:01,879 --> 00:31:07,320
Well, the main criterion is, and we get rid of Raskolnikov right off.

313
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:15,799
By the way, I started to say when he raised his hand, something I think is most important as an aside, that people who read this book, almost none of them ever understand it.

314
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:25,160
But one of the main ways of misunderstanding it is doing what we're doing right now and saying, ah, yeah, but what about Hitler and Charles Manson and Raskolnikov and all these bad guys?

315
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,520
You're going to count them as Knights of faith to suspending the ethical?

316
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,039
And Kierkegaard's onto that.

317
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:32,480
That's what I'm reading you now.

318
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,919
He's perfectly, he said he's not going to fall for that.

319
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:42,160
He has his criteria for distinguishing knights of faith from the ethical.

320
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,839
And the main one is the one we've got to have right now.

321
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,679
The knight of faith respects the universal.

322
00:31:50,000 --> 00:32:05,200
That is, unless the knight of faith feels this tension that he's doing something wrong and that he hates doing something wrong and he hates himself for doing something wrong.

323
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:14,559
Remember this was the problem with Abraham having to say to himself he's a murderer and a gay person having to say to themselves they're disgusting and so forth.

324
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,960
And that's because they do respect the ethical.

325
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,840
This is on page 106.

326
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,520
It's about eight lines down.

327
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:27,600
The tragic hero can, in a sense, be helped by the universal.

328
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:28,400
Skipping a little.

329
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,039
But the knight of faith is alone about everything.

330
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,800
The tragic hero acts and finds his point of rest in the universal.

331
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,799
The knight of faith is kept in constant tension.

332
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,239
That's not the right thing to read.

333
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,199
Not long.

334
00:32:41,199 --> 00:32:42,399
Not what I want.

335
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:44,879
I'll read that later.

336
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,839
Remember that one.

337
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,320
But we want to be on 103.

338
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,960
Yeah, yeah, there we are.

339
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,240
That's a nice one.

340
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,559
About six lines down in the first full paragraph.

341
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:13,520
Someone who believes it is a simple enough matter to be the individual, that's the right word there, can always be certain that he is not the knight of faith.

342
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:19,640
For stragglers and vagrant geniuses are not men of faith.

343
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:23,880
Well, a vagrant genius is the Rostolnikov, for instance.

344
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:29,079
He thinks he's just so much better than everybody else that he can do whatever he wants.

345
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:35,079
Now he says, faith's knight knows, on the contrary, that it's glorious to belong to the universal.

346
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,840
That's very important.

347
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:52,280
They've got to have, they really have to see the total value and the authority of the universal just as much as if they were a Greek, because they are, as we all are, part Greek in this.

348
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,319
So he goes on for this beautiful passage.

349
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,599
I don't think I've ever read this.

350
00:33:56,599 --> 00:34:01,160
And again, for Elizabeth, this is the further statement of what I'm trying to say to you.

351
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:08,120
He knows that it is beautiful and benign to be the particular, who translates himself into the universal.

352
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:10,840
That's the right particular there, the lower one.

353
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:15,319
The one who, so to speak, makes a clear and elegant edition of himself.

354
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,119
See what he's doing?

355
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:20,679
He's finding the language to describe himself, but that everybody can read.

356
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:23,880
As immaculate as possible and readable for all.

357
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:28,120
He knows it is refreshing to become intelligible to oneself in the universal.

358
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:37,559
And so that he understands the universal and everyone who understands him understands the universal through him in turn and both rejoice in the security of the universal.

359
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:42,039
Okay, that's what the knight of faith knows.

360
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:47,400
And he knows it as he suspends the universal and goes against it.

361
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,760
He respects it.

362
00:34:48,759 --> 00:34:53,079
He feels under it, sort of obliged to do it.

363
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:57,719
He feels how great it would be to be able to do it, but he can't do it.

364
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:03,039
Skipping down a bit, higher up there winds a lonely path, narrow and steep.

365
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:05,520
This is the night of faith now, suspending the ethical.

366
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:12,000
He knows it's terrible to be born in solitude outside the universal, to walk without meeting a single traveler.

367
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,840
He knows very well where he is and how he's related to men.

368
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,400
Humanly speaking, he's insane and cannot make himself understood to anyone.

369
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:32,720
And yet insane is the mildest expression for him, meaning that he's just absolutely unable not only to say, but to comprehend what in the world he is doing.

370
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:42,559
And again, keep saying, if you don't like the Abraham and Isaac story, which is pretty crazy and far-fetched, take the gay person, take my Nazi example.

371
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:55,280
Just use whatever example to keep reminding you what it's like to be completely alone, utterly unable to speak, and feeling you must be crazy, and yet that this is what you must do.

372
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,640
Okay, so that criterion is crucial.

373
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:05,199
And that, in a way, has another part to it, but I have to hold it for a minute.

374
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,359
There are three criteria.

375
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:11,520
The first two are important only because they get you to the third one.

376
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,640
We've done one.

377
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:13,839
I mean, you've got to be free.

378
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,279
That's outside the criteria.

379
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:22,639
That's just a basic condition to get into the game at all, that you're not Peter Laurie or so forth.

380
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:27,600
But once you're in the what you can choose to do business, we've had the first one.

381
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,559
You've got to respect the ethical completely.

382
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:34,960
Second, you can't believe that you will have a higher universal.

383
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,000
And so you can justify what you're doing against the ordinary universal.

384
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,039
And you can't explain it to people, but not because you can't understand it.

385
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:46,279
It's just that they're too stupid to understand it.

386
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:48,359
And eventually you could make them understand it.

387
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:53,320
That would be to have your own higher ethical.

388
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:57,480
That wouldn't be the night of faith suspending the ethical.

389
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:04,680
That would be somebody like Agamemnon subsuming a lower ethical against a higher ethical.

390
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:07,320
You'd be in the universal business.

391
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:27,559
And this is on page 106, where it says somewhere in the bottom paragraph: whether the individual is now really in a state of temptation or knight of faith, only the individual can decide.

392
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:34,600
Still, it's possible on the basis of the paradox to construct certain criteria, which even someone not in it can understand.

393
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:40,599
And now here's number two criterion: The true knight of faith is always in absolute isolation.

394
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:41,879
There's a typo there.

395
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,200
It's always in absolute isolation.

396
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:46,760
The false knight is sectarian.

397
00:37:46,759 --> 00:37:48,440
Okay, what does that mean?

398
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,360
Well, that's a funny way to put it.

399
00:37:50,360 --> 00:38:06,120
But what that means is that the true knight of faith can't go around trying to give out principles and get people to, so to speak, join his movement or join him and his sect, whatever it is.

400
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:11,720
That is, he can't think that he's got a new and better universal.

401
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,920
Right across from that, on page 107, you read: the true knight of faith is a witness, never a teacher.

402
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:28,520
That means never, I mean, to be a witness is, I think, just to be able to sacrifice yourself if you have to for this paradox.

403
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:39,280
But as the gay person might well do, or the Aryan kid who's protecting the Jewish girl, whatever.

404
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:45,279
But that would be to be a witness, but they wouldn't be able to say, I'm doing it for a reason.

405
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,639
You guys just don't understand.

406
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:53,440
You've been brainwashed by Hitler, or you've been brought up in this racist society, or something like that.

407
00:38:53,759 --> 00:39:06,400
So they have, if the person thinks that they can explain, justify what they're doing, then they also can't be the knight of faith suspending the ethical.

408
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,679
So they would be proposing a new ethical, in effect.

409
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:21,840
Sometimes Hitler seems to be doing that and giving arguments why Jews are really just like vermin and dangerous to the culture and science shows this and so forth.

410
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:26,640
Well, if that's the view one has of Hitler, then they'll be still ruled out.

411
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:33,039
You're ruled out if you don't respect the ethical and you're ruled out if you do respect the ethical and think you've got a new better one.

412
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,639
So those are the two.

413
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:42,880
But what the really interesting one and what you should expect from Kierkegaard if you really have a feel for this is a third one.

414
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,839
And this is sort of what it looks like from the inside.

415
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:49,440
These two other ones you can see from the outside.

416
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,280
Does he respect the ethical?

417
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,280
Does he think he's got a new ethical?

418
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,480
Rule him out.

419
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,240
He's not a knight of faith suspending the ethical.

420
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,599
The final one is: how does it feel to be a knight of faith?

421
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,960
Well, you should know, you feel anguish.

422
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:24,920
The same old anguish you heard about in the very beginning: only in the world of the spirit, only who feels anguish will get bliss, only who draws the knife will get the bread, the same anguish that the knight of faith who sees the sword over the head of the beloved and loves as if it's the surest thing of all, feels all the time.

423
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:31,880
And so, of course, does the person suspending the ethical feel anguish all the time.

424
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:36,120
Now I have to look at see if I can find that.

425
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:42,760
Yeah, well, 60 is the best expression of this, about 15 lines down.

426
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:47,239
The ethical expression of what Abraham did is that he was willing to murder Isaac.

427
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:50,840
The religious expression is that he was willing to sacrifice Isaac.

428
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:56,039
But in this contradiction lies the very anguish that can indeed make one sleepless.

429
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:59,880
And yet without that anguish, Abraham is not the one he is.

430
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:07,799
That is saying that you have to live in this paradox, in the contradiction, that you can do something you can't understand.

431
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:11,959
And that is the anguish.

432
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:21,960
The anguish of getting more involved while seeing the vulnerable, the anguish of doing what you feel you ought to do while seeing that it's a terribly wrong thing to do.

433
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,760
So on 89, you get it again.

434
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:28,920
Abraham can't be mediated.

435
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:30,039
What did I say?

436
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:31,879
89, top paragraph.

437
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:37,880
Abraham can't be mediated, which can also be put by saying he cannot speak.

438
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:44,520
For the moment he speaks, he expresses the universal, and then he says, in effect, that he's a murderer.

439
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,920
And where do I say now?

440
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:57,400
So that, and now, then we go to 106, because that's where he says this tension and dread that his anguish are inevitable.

441
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,960
I said I read 106 too early, remember, about 50 lines down.

442
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:09,039
The tragic hero can, in a sense, be held by the universal, but the knight of faith is alone about everything.

443
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:12,800
The tragic hero acts and finds his point of rest in the universal.

444
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,680
The knight of faith is kept in constant tension.

445
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:23,280
Well, constant tension is obviously another name for anguish, but we should really find it when he names it.

446
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,960
He names it.

447
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,960
How about 137?

448
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,640
That's outside your reading again, but that's the best place.

449
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:44,399
I don't want you to have to read that whole problem three, which is mostly a kind of Kierkegaardian erotic kind of craziness, just to get these few quotes.

450
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,679
So just pick them out.

451
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:51,680
On 137, about two-thirds of the way down, this is the punchline for this.

452
00:42:51,679 --> 00:43:00,400
For distress and anguish are the only justification conceivable, even though they cannot be conceived in general.

453
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,639
Or skipping the next paragraph: Abraham is silent, but he cannot speak.

454
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:07,360
Therein lies the distress and anguish.

455
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:16,639
Okay, so the test for whether the knight or faith is, if he wants to ask himself, Am I a knight of faith suspending the ethical?

456
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:22,720
Is that he's in constant anguish because he both respects the ethical and breaks the ethical.

457
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:29,520
Now, anybody want to say anything about that?

458
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,960
That's another sort of chunk of what I want to say.

459
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:35,439
I'll end up there, or you're no, you're stretching.

460
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,079
Okay.

461
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,720
Anybody want to say anything?

462
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:41,359
Okay.

463
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:45,319
Well, that only shows, I think, either that, yeah, good.

464
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,759
I feel uneasy.

465
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,760
I can't believe it's clear and simpler.

466
00:43:58,039 --> 00:43:59,400
Interesting.

467
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,600
Interesting.

468
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,840
I don't know.

469
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:09,799
Because he's so confused about what he's doing with Regina.

470
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,599
And so, what has he done?

471
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:29,799
He thinks that he, like Abraham, has sort of killed her and gone against the ethical, broken this engagement, and he feels that that's the right thing to do and the best thing to do, but he can't explain to himself or her or anybody else why.

472
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:36,039
And so, I think he does think that he's a knight of faith.

473
00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:38,120
He's got the anguish and the tension.

474
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:45,559
What I think he thinks is that DeSalentio, who's writing this book, can't understand being a knight of faith.

475
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:53,639
But you've got to at least have a glimmer if you're Kierkegaard writing about what DeSalentio can understand and what he can't understand.

476
00:44:54,280 --> 00:45:03,000
It's tricky because Kierkegaard never claimed to be the fullest kind of Christian who lived constantly in the paradox.

477
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:16,360
He writes, but, and this is a puzzle for me and you, he writes books, two books, from within the highest Christian understanding of what it is to be a human being.

478
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:21,000
And he does it, I think, by saying that he gets it out of the Bible.

479
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:27,479
That if you read the Bible and read about Jesus and what he did, you can see something that he can't do.

480
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,680
I believe that must be what it is.

481
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:42,160
You will see it, by the way, just so you, I'll tell you now, what you're holding is the something, the most important piece, I think, of the most important book.

482
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:51,360
If you want to understand the highest form of Christianity, it's a book called The Concept of Anxiety or Dread.

483
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,319
What is it called on there?

484
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,999
It gets translated two different ways.

485
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,479
I forget which way it gets translated on the piece of paper you have.

486
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:01,520
No, it isn't the concept of dread.

487
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,879
Boy, am I speaking nonsense?

488
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,399
It's sickness unto death.

489
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:08,640
The concept of dread is a different Kierkegaard book, and it's not written by any of these guys.

490
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,959
I mean, it's written by some other pseudonym.

491
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:22,640
No, the sickness unto death is Kierkegaard's book about the despair of all the wrong ways of life and the only right way, which is being a Christian.

492
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:24,719
And he does not put his name on it.

493
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:33,600
He makes up a pseudonym for it and says this pseudonym is a higher form of Christian than he's ever able to be.

494
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,000
All that is related to your question.

495
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,359
Okay, what else?

496
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:37,679
Yeah.

497
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,360
Absolutely nothing.

498
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:51,359
I guess I'm still confused by you at once.

499
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,479
You're right already.

500
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:58,559
It's very confusing what Kierkegaard says about God.

501
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:05,039
And I want it to mean that it's his calling, it's his unconditional commitment.

502
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:29,319
I want it not to be a calling from a supreme being because he's pretty clear that, and I put the quote on your paper that I gave you because I thought you otherwise wouldn't believe me, at the very bottom of the page, I forget which page, I give you the quote about God that I constantly have in the background, and it's from sickness unto death.

503
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:36,680
So it's from the crucial book, and that it's on page two, I think.

504
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:40,679
I didn't bring page two, it looks like.

505
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:46,120
So what is it at the bottom of page two that God is that all things are possible?

506
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:47,160
Yeah, okay.

507
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:52,279
God is that all things are possible, and all things are possible is God.

508
00:47:52,599 --> 00:48:00,359
He's trying to get you out of thinking of God as a supreme being, as the creator, as an object that you can love.

509
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:08,600
Remember, it's DeSilentio who loves God like a super being and feels full of love for God and full of happiness when he's contemplating God.

510
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:10,679
That's all too platonic.

511
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:13,720
That's not real Christianity, Kierkegaard says.

512
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:26,119
And you don't need a God of the sort that you all think God is if you realize that Jesus was God, Kierkegaard would say.

513
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:43,720
And once a religion has produced the God-man, this person who was a human being at a finite temporal time in a certain place, he was there at whatever it was, AD, in Bethlehem and Jerusalem, and he was God at the same time.

514
00:48:44,199 --> 00:48:50,120
When you get a religion that has produced that, you don't need to have a relation to the Supreme Being.

515
00:48:50,119 --> 00:48:51,399
You're very well off.

516
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:57,640
God has come so close, and Jesus can do everything for you that God can do for you.

517
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:08,480
And Kierkegaard also says that once God becomes man, access to God as a Supreme Being is cut off.

518
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:14,320
That means either there isn't any, or there is, but you can't get there or find out.

519
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,759
At least it's irrelevant.

520
00:49:15,759 --> 00:49:20,640
I think the right thing to say for Kierkegaard, it's the way Christianity is set up.

521
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,480
The whole idea, and now, now comes the hard part.

522
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,520
I mean, this is the easy part.

523
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,960
I haven't answered you yet.

524
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:38,400
Because that's why, therefore, God should be, in this book, the calling, whatever it is that you get called to do this unconditional something.

525
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,479
But there's nobody doing the calling.

526
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:45,760
And he doesn't talk about praying to God, and he doesn't, and so forth.

527
00:49:45,759 --> 00:49:54,559
There is just this fact about the way the world is and people are, that there is unconditional callings to people.

528
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:57,760
And that's one aspect of God.

529
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,679
I think God has three aspects.

530
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:04,000
Two of them are all right, and one of them is a mess with the way Kierkegaard sets it up.

531
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:12,240
The other aspect of God is that God is, that all things are possible, and that's God has got to be that.

532
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:20,559
Because otherwise, the part of the aspect of God, which is the calling, would get you to resignation.

533
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:32,400
But it's only because you can be called to an unconditional commitment and all things are possible, even the inconceivable is possible, that you can live in a way you can't understand.

534
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:49,159
So, the second function of God is there's the calling, and there's a certain way of living that you can't understand, and God is the name for the sort of, I think of it as a kind of atmosphere or something that makes that possible.

535
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,240
It's not an entity.

536
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,480
It's there is this sort of atmosphere.

537
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,199
If you get in touch with it, and how do you get in touch with it?

538
00:50:58,199 --> 00:50:59,160
Through faith.

539
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:06,840
If you get in touch with it through faith, you are able to live seeing the sword over the head of the beloved and get involved more and more.

540
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:11,000
You are able to go against the ethical and feel justified.

541
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,400
But you only can do all that, of course, in anguish, but that's not what we're talking about right now.

542
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:25,079
Now, the third problem about God is the fact, and here's where I have to just do a heavy interpretation on it.

543
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:30,440
I think I don't see how you can make sense of it unless you deal with it the way I'm about to deal with it.

544
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:38,840
So, God now, in the Abraham story, calls Abraham to sacrifice Isaac.

545
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:48,839
Now, it's one thing for God to be Abraham's calling, his defining thing, to be the father of the faith and go and kill all those, knock over all those idols and stuff.

546
00:51:48,840 --> 00:52:02,920
It's another thing to understand how God has a calling, God as an atmosphere, can go around telling Abraham to kill his own defining commitment, namely Isaac.

547
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,039
That makes no sense.

548
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:05,319
That's what you sense.

549
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,480
That's what anybody, all of you sense that.

550
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:15,480
And I feel like if only I could get that out of this book or get that book out of this course, I would be happy because it's hard to deal with it.

551
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:32,159
Here's what you have to think: God is some kind of absolute relation to the absolute, as he calls it, which comes in and says, Your defining commitment is impossible, and your defining period.

552
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:33,520
Let's start with that.

553
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:35,840
Now, what can that be?

554
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:40,879
Well, you have to think of that, I think, as the vulnerability of the defining commitment.

555
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:54,559
The third aspect of God is that there's something that you can't control or understand or predict that can at any minute take your defining commitment away from you.

556
00:52:54,559 --> 00:53:03,120
And that requires you to, in a certain sense, give up your unconditional commitment if you're being reasonable.

557
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:07,359
It requires, I mean, if you've got any imagination, you don't have to kill Isaac.

558
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,959
You just have to be able to see that you can't get involved this way.

559
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,160
You see the sword.

560
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:14,800
Oh, I remember, I just said it to myself this morning.

561
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,440
The third function of God is to be the sword hanging over the head of the beloved.

562
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:26,880
Something that limits your unconditional commitment and makes it dangerous.

563
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:30,800
So God has the God is the calling.

564
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,880
God is the thing that limits the unconditional commitment and makes it dangerous.

565
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:42,000
And God is that all things are possible atmosphere that makes you able to stick with your unconditional commitment anyway.

566
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,839
And no wonder you can't understand it.

567
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:47,200
Kierkegaard's using God in these three different ways.

568
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:57,840
And none of these ways is the way you're used to God being, namely the Supreme Being and the Creator and the Source of all meaning and intelligibility and all that.

569
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:58,879
That's all.

570
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,480
Kierkegaard wants to throw that all out and give it back to Plato.

571
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,079
Does that help any?

572
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,559
Or just drive you crazy?

573
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,399
Okay, well, you have to keep asking about that.

574
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:16,520
It's my job, I must admit, to try to make sense of it, but I can't make any more sense of it than I just did.

575
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,200
But I can do it again and again.

576
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:18,359
Yeah.

577
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,559
Why what?

578
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:35,160
Okay, well, Abraham, why does Abraham have to listen to God?

579
00:54:35,159 --> 00:54:50,119
Well, if, as I say, as I'm claiming, God is the absolute limit on your commitment, namely that the sword is hanging over the head of the beloved, that's not just a fact.

580
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:54,120
It isn't just improbable that your loved one will die.

581
00:54:54,679 --> 00:54:55,399
They will.

582
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,679
I mean, it may be you're lucky.

583
00:54:56,679 --> 00:54:57,800
You may die first.

584
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:03,640
But this whole relationship is going to be vulnerable and is going to be destroyed.

585
00:55:03,639 --> 00:55:12,760
And that you're going to have to be able to accept that and live with it and act on it, even though you don't understand what you're doing when you're acting on it.

586
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,119
That's it.

587
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:16,520
I mean, so God isn't just any old trouble.

588
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:24,520
God is this fundamental trouble that everything in space and time is going to.

589
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,920
God is behind.

590
00:55:27,159 --> 00:55:33,399
God makes every absolute commitment happen by calling you, although there's, remember, nobody there calling.

591
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,000
You get a calling.

592
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:44,200
And God is there making every absolute commitment dangerous and therefore making you anxious.

593
00:55:44,199 --> 00:55:47,000
That's the sword hanging over the head of the beloved.

594
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,559
You get, God is both the calling.

595
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:50,759
That's what drives you crazy.

596
00:55:50,759 --> 00:56:03,440
God is both the calling and what makes the calling something that is so dangerous that you don't want to have it, and it isn't even rational to have it, which makes it possible to have it anyway.

597
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:04,319
That's this third thing.

598
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,800
God is that all things are possible.

599
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:10,719
And faith, you don't have faith when you get the calling.

600
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:12,079
That just happens.

601
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:19,119
And you don't need faith to understand that it's all, death is behind everything, as Halloway says.

602
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:20,800
That's just the way it is.

603
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:26,879
But you do need faith to be able to act in a way that you can't understand.

604
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:31,520
To do what is impossible, even though you can't think it.

605
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:40,720
Remember, to do what is impossible is to go accept the calling, even though it's vulnerable and get more and more involved and be defenseless.

606
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:48,720
And it's to go against the ethical and do absolutely awful things while feeling nonetheless this is the best thing you've ever done.

607
00:56:48,719 --> 00:57:03,039
Those things you can do, even though you can't understand how, because God is there, namely, there is somehow in the universe a way that even the impossible is possible.

608
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:03,599
Yeah.

609
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,720
No, that's the wrong way to put it.

610
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:16,960
If you get a calling, you believe in God, because we're going to redefine God.

611
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:26,079
So that's, you'll believe in God if you feel that there's an unconditional commitment calling you and you're doing it.

612
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:29,919
For Kierkegaard's point of view, that is to believe in God.

613
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:51,320
To spell it out a little more, it's you will be acting in a way that is sort of like the way the disciples acted when they understood that they should make choicesus the center of their life, and that way they would become individuals, and that would save them from despair, and so forth.

614
00:57:51,320 --> 00:58:03,880
When they understood that, they understood everything there was to understand about Jesus being God, and that happens when Dante understands that Beatrice is his savior.

615
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:11,480
So once you get called, whatever calls you as your savior, and this will be a little mind-boggling, but I'll throw it in.

616
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:18,120
Whatever calls you creates you as an individual, so that it's in a way your creator.

617
00:58:18,759 --> 00:58:22,359
And that's what's left of the creator story.

618
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:26,119
Jesus created these apostles and renamed them.

619
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:30,920
I only know that he named Saul, or Saul at least, understood that he was now named Paul.

620
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:34,119
But Mark and Luke and all those aren't these people's original names.

621
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:36,200
They've been recreated, reborn.

622
00:58:36,199 --> 00:58:40,760
They are new beings to talk like Kierkegaard does in Fear and Trembling at one point.

623
00:58:42,039 --> 00:58:45,320
The defining Paul can create you as a new being.

624
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,079
And Jesus has the further thing.

625
00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:51,240
That makes you more like more than just any calling.

626
00:58:51,239 --> 00:58:53,399
He changes the whole history of the world.

627
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,000
He creates a new world.

628
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:59,000
The Christian world, not the Greek world, and everything has changed.

629
00:58:59,239 --> 00:59:04,280
In my other course, I try to explain what's changed, but it would not be this course.

630
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:05,639
Okay.

631
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:06,759
Good.

632
00:59:06,759 --> 00:59:09,720
You see, I stopped, and there were plenty of good questions.

633
00:59:09,719 --> 00:59:10,759
Yeah, maybe more.

634
00:59:10,759 --> 00:59:12,520
Okay, go ahead.

635
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:15,959
Oh, okay.

636
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:16,999
That's easy.

637
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,200
The Danish church is the Lutheran church.

638
00:59:20,199 --> 00:59:30,399
You'd think that he would be happy to be a good Lutheran, and I think he thinks he is a good Lutheran, but the Danish church was, as you just said, it, the state church.

639
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:34,000
And just being born, we got an echo, haven't we?

640
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:43,200
Just being born in Denmark was enough to make you a Christian.

641
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:52,320
And therefore, he says, the church is the big block to being a Christian, because everybody can just relax and think they're a Christian.

642
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:56,480
And he thinks that's terrible, that it's very, very hard to be a Christian.

643
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,039
To be a Christian, what you have to do is be a knight of faith.

644
00:59:59,039 --> 01:00:01,439
And to be a knight of faith, you have to live in anguish.

645
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:06,400
And there's nothing about that being preached by the church.

646
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:20,479
In fact, the church has fallen for Hegel and his friends, ex-friends, who were preachers in the church or pastors, whatever they were called in Lutheran churches, he thinks have sold out to Hegel.

647
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,920
So the church becomes the big enemy.

648
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:31,119
And the last book he wrote, I think I mentioned, his attack on Christendom, where he attacks the church and all of the bishops or whatever they're called.

649
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:32,559
I think they're bishops.

650
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:39,760
And he does it, you could say, because they're corrupted by philosophy, to put it as politely as possible, I guess.

651
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:51,679
So anyway, so he thinks it's his mission to sacrifice everything, his love of Regina and his chance to do anything else he wrote from morning till night.

652
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:54,879
I don't know, he must have written at least 40 books.

653
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,159
I haven't counted them.

654
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:59,680
And to do all that, and for what?

655
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:06,800
To make Christianity the most difficult thing you could possibly have.

656
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:13,280
And, of course, the most rewarding, because he who has the anguish has the bliss.

657
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:20,920
And thereby to show everybody that they're in despair and how to get out of it, which is what I'm going to talk about next time.

658
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,439
That's a sensible question.

659
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:23,880
Anything else?

660
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:28,679
I'm ready to go on, but I'm also happy to straighten out all these loose ends.

661
01:01:28,679 --> 01:01:29,240
Yeah.

662
01:01:34,679 --> 01:01:37,079
What effect did that have on?

663
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:39,240
Ah.

664
01:01:39,239 --> 01:01:41,879
Well, I can just say huge effect.

665
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:44,440
It didn't change Catholic theology.

666
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:47,880
And I have this funny feeling that the Danes were the last to understand.

667
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:52,200
There's nothing good written about Kierkegaard in Danish, as far as I know.

668
01:01:52,199 --> 01:02:03,399
And although they do a nice job of editing the collected works in Copenhagen, but it had a huge influence on Protestant theologians, famous ones that you may not have heard of anymore.

669
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:07,240
Paul Tilleck was the big one when I was an undergraduate.

670
01:02:07,239 --> 01:02:11,399
But there's Bultmann and there's Karl Bart.

671
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,480
And they're all variations.

672
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:27,399
But all these people who, any kind of existentialist Christianity comes out of Kierkegaard's thing, which is to sh and he, and it seems to me that's pretty important.

673
01:02:27,719 --> 01:02:31,000
He didn't, for him, by the way, influence Dostoevsky a bit.

674
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,320
Dostoevsky has his own completely original version of Christianity.

675
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:38,039
I don't think he knew Kierkegaard stuff.

676
01:02:38,679 --> 01:02:43,719
Okay, I want to go back to this and cover one more thing before we finish today.

677
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:51,800
Yeah, okay.

678
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:59,920
So now, the next mind-boggling thing, if you're still got enough strength to take on one hard, one more hard thing.

679
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:05,600
What does it mean that Abraham is able to get a new Isaac?

680
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:22,079
Well, it was easy, well, relatively easy, to give you what we could call the MIT equation about grief and how if you interiorize the loved one, you can keep them as part of your identity and still be open to another finite temporal person to love.

681
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:28,480
That's something, when you're doing it, you can't be explaining it to yourself or it won't work, but you can do it.

682
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:40,240
You can, while feeling completely that this is the last person you'll ever love and you want to be dead too, if you do that in the field of all things are possible, you'll come out able to love somebody else.

683
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:41,360
But what is this?

684
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,039
And then you would get a new Isaac.

685
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:47,680
Remember, he actually talks about getting a new Isaac on 139.

686
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,160
He mentions it.

687
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:59,440
He talks about, and again, it's not in your reading, but he says, the Lord will give me a new Isaac on the strength of the absurd.

688
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,840
That's what Abraham is saying to himself.

689
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:04,320
And there's another place I had two.

690
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:09,279
Well, the other one is I won't bother to read because it's getting a new Isaac.

691
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,520
See, I think there are two getting new Isaacs.

692
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,799
I'm going beyond the book now.

693
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,119
That's why I say this is hard, and you have to break yourself.

694
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:19,600
There's nothing in Kierkegaard to fit what I'm saying.

695
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:23,039
Just as I'm going to explain what getting a new Isaac is.

696
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:26,319
I explained it already for a Hiroshima Monomur.

697
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:34,399
That is, I explained it for what the Knight of Faith, like the Japanese man, had to do, namely go through grief.

698
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,919
Now, what can you say?

699
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:39,760
What would it be like to get a new ethical?

700
01:04:39,759 --> 01:04:41,600
And how would you do it?

701
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:50,120
Well, I think the answer is almost too easy.

702
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:58,920
That is, to get a new ethical is to go through the cultural suffering, whatever it takes.

703
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:03,400
It isn't as clearly described as grief, at least if it is, I don't know about it.

704
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:08,599
But you do it in such a way that you change the ethical.

705
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:14,440
Now, that's inconceivable you can change the ethical, but it was inconceivable you could change the defining relation.

706
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,880
It's eternal.

707
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:20,039
But you can pull this peculiar move, or you change the eternal in time.

708
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:29,000
Remember, you change your relation to the defining person, though you don't get rid of them as giving you a meaning in your life that lasts forever.

709
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,960
You change how you relate to them when they're gone.

710
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,000
That's fine.

711
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,960
Well, here you're going to change the eternal again.

712
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:44,839
Certainly, the ethical is universal and seems to be eternal because it's inconceivable that you could think about it any other way.

713
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:47,960
It's inconceivable to have a culture where murder is just all right.

714
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:52,280
Fathers can kill their sons as long as they say, I was called to do it.

715
01:05:52,280 --> 01:06:02,359
It's inconceivable that these depraved homosexuals could be living normal, healthy, happy, moral human lives and get married even.

716
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,760
This is just outrageously impossible.

717
01:06:04,759 --> 01:06:06,280
But it happens.

718
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:09,559
And that's, and how does it happen?

719
01:06:09,559 --> 01:06:26,999
Well, it requires that people who have faith live in the anxiety of, say, being homosexual or protecting Jews under Nazi Germany.

720
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:45,119
And if they can do that, then the culture can go through enough suffering through what they have to go through if they're gay in a straight in Copenhagen or Jew-loving in Nazi Germany.

721
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:50,719
If somehow they suffer enough of that, the ethical does change.

722
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,679
It's just that you can't tell the story backwards.

723
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:55,279
Remember, we talked about that.

724
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:59,279
It's not all right to say, well, good.

725
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:05,919
Now we know how unparadoxical things were in Copenhagen in 1850 or in Nazi Germany.

726
01:07:05,919 --> 01:07:10,319
No, they were absolutely paradoxical, and the person was in anguish.

727
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:12,799
And there's no way to get around that.

728
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:23,919
But nonetheless, you can finally get the inconceivable transformed into what's conceivable.

729
01:07:23,919 --> 01:07:47,279
And that's what Kierkegaard doesn't know how to do, doesn't know how anybody does it, only knows in this dim way that if Isaac is the ethical, and if you are a paradoxical enough person and you believe in faith enough and you act on what you can't understand, you can get a new Isaac, which is a new ethical.

730
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:51,199
And it's inconceivable you could get a new Isaac, but you get it anyway.

731
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,799
You can't get it, maybe.

732
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:55,199
Maybe it takes the culture to get it.

733
01:07:55,200 --> 01:08:01,440
But it can't happen that a new ethical comes and people get a new language.

734
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:04,079
And being gay becomes something that's okay.

735
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:04,480
Yeah.

736
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:14,839
Is that what he thinks?

737
01:08:14,839 --> 01:08:15,240
Yes.

738
01:08:17,559 --> 01:08:21,559
Let me repeat it, make sure I got clear for the podcasting.

739
01:08:21,959 --> 01:08:25,959
So am I saying that you have to go through all this suffering to change society?

740
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,039
A trauma.

741
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,759
Somebody repeat what she says.

742
01:08:40,759 --> 01:08:42,679
I can't hear her well enough from here.

743
01:08:42,679 --> 01:08:43,159
But.

744
01:09:02,999 --> 01:09:04,440
Change the ethical.

745
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:05,320
Yes, right.

746
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:06,839
I think that's what I am saying.

747
01:09:06,839 --> 01:09:09,319
See, I don't know how to describe it like grief.

748
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:13,559
I just think you'd have to describe each time in detail what did happen.

749
01:09:13,559 --> 01:09:28,839
Well, enough gay people suffered somehow, and that they're suffering made it possible for people for them to understand, and through them, for everybody else to understand, that they were human beings and okay too.

750
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:37,159
And I don't know whether under Nazi Germany it could ever have happened because they would have been killed off each person who tried to do it.

751
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:39,879
But maybe it would have happened.

752
01:09:39,879 --> 01:10:03,839
The important thing is that it can happen that through a certain amount of suffering, what was inconceivable, couldn't be put in the language of ethics, was literally unintelligible, becomes, gets a new language about what is worthy, and makes what was seeming to be sinful okay.

753
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:07,759
And that must be what it is to get a new Isaac.

754
01:10:07,759 --> 01:10:10,319
And now the question is sort of interesting.

755
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,320
Why is this something that happens?

756
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,400
in our culture?

757
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:19,039
Well, it goes back to being this kind of conflicted culture that we are.

758
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:23,119
If there was only the ethical, we'd just be stuck in our ethical.

759
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,280
I think that's how the Greeks presumably were.

760
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:32,799
They were making it more and more clear, presumably, people like Plato and Aristotle, that basically their ethical was set.

761
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:46,799
It's only because we get this Christian, Judeo-Christian thing coming in of somebody coming along, and that was Jesus, who flipped the whole Hebrew story into a completely different story.

762
01:10:46,799 --> 01:11:03,599
I can't go into the details, but let's just say the same thing that Paul says in the Bible, that a religion of the law and external actions which were either good or bad, and could be judged, became a religion of desire.

763
01:11:03,599 --> 01:11:07,599
And Jesus switches everything around where people get judged on their desire.

764
01:11:07,599 --> 01:11:14,799
So he says in the Sermon on the Mount, he commits adultery, who lusts after a woman in his heart.

765
01:11:14,799 --> 01:11:20,320
That's a crazy thing to say from a Hebrew point of view, because you just either commit adultery or you don't.

766
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,360
And it's perfectly obvious.

767
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,440
It's a fact, and then there's a law against it.

768
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:26,959
And then if you did it, you get stoned, and that's that.

769
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:39,039
But you could invent a whole new religion in which desire was what was important, and purity was what was important, and you couldn't bring it about by your willpower.

770
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:43,480
The more you tried to resist lusting after women in your heart, the more you would do it.

771
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:47,079
So you can't help yourself.

772
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:50,440
You need a savior outside who will help you.

773
01:11:50,679 --> 01:11:52,679
And everything gets shifted around.

774
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:56,360
It's different after that.

775
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:02,440
And we're in a culture, I think, thanks to the God-man.

776
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:06,119
I don't think it was, we had this in our culture before then.

777
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:27,400
We're in a culture in which you can have sort of radical new understandings of the ethical because you can have people who are, so to speak, crazy from everybody's point of view, but who win out after a lot of sacrifices and martyrs and suffering, and people come to see it their way.

778
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:32,360
So that makes our culture a very interesting kind of culture.

779
01:12:32,679 --> 01:12:38,599
Because we have this conflict, if we didn't have the ethical, there'd just be a bunch of crazies running around.

780
01:12:38,839 --> 01:12:46,999
You couldn't tell the people who had a new ethical from the people who were the Charles Mansons and the Raskolnikovs.

781
01:12:46,999 --> 01:12:49,159
So you need the ethical, the Greek.

782
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:56,919
If we didn't have the Christian, we wouldn't have the idea that you could have the way of behaving that goes against the ethical that was higher than the ethical.

783
01:12:56,919 --> 01:12:59,319
There wouldn't be anything higher than the ethical.

784
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:22,360
But if you put the two together, you get the possibility of people acting in such a way that though they can't understand it and nobody else can understand what they're doing, if they act in the faith that even the impossible is possible, it may actually become really intelligible what they were doing and what the culture was doing.

785
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:26,759
And that makes our culture a very interesting kind of culture.

786
01:13:26,759 --> 01:13:31,599
We are supposedly, the sociologists say, the only hot culture.

787
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:38,959
In most cultures, the ethical stays fixed, and what counts as real stays fixed.

788
01:13:38,959 --> 01:13:58,400
But in our culture, the ethical has changed many times, certainly from the Greek pagan kind of ethical to the Christian kind of ethical, to the Kantian kind of ethical, to our maybe something like the medical kind of ethical, where the question is whether gays are sick or not.

789
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:05,599
And when you discover that they're not sick, then that changes the worthiness of them and so forth.

790
01:14:05,919 --> 01:14:13,039
And I can't explain this in this course, it's in the Heidegger course, but we've had about six different understandings of reality.

791
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:22,319
But you can sort of imagine the Romans thought reality was stuff that you produced, and the Christians thought reality was created by God.

792
01:14:22,799 --> 01:14:27,360
The moderns think that reality is interpreted by us, and so forth.

793
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:32,159
So that means that we're the richest kind of culture.

794
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:33,360
It may not be for the best.

795
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,400
That's hard to know whether we're going downhill or uphill with this.

796
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:49,039
But I'm enough of an optimist to think that it's a good thing that through suffering, the ethical can be changed, because in general, through suffering, the ethical gets improved, I believe.

797
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:52,079
And we've got the only culture that can do it.

798
01:14:52,080 --> 01:15:00,400
And Kierkegaard is on to how contradictory and paradoxical it is for us to be able to do it.

799
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,320
Okay, that's enough for today.
