00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
Well, I'm going to start by sort of placing Nietzsche with the other two people we've talked about.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:24,919
And feel free to sort of interrupt and ask me things because this is not that I'm going to pose you deep problems, but just generally orienting ourselves is something that I'm not always sure where you're coming from, so I'm not always sure that I've got the right way to orient things.

3
00:00:24,919 --> 00:00:27,000
But here's how I would describe it.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:37,959
We've so far studied what seems to me to be, and I think a lot of people would agree, the two greatest Christian thinkers of modern times, Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky.

5
00:00:37,959 --> 00:01:07,000
What's interesting about them, it makes them sort of very original Christian thinkers, is that they're going to save Christianity, they think, by leaving out the Platonic, metaphysical, theological aspect of Christianity, and even the Supreme Being as the most metaphysical and theological aspect, which is pretty weird and daring and interesting.

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:25,959
And they're going to save Christianity by going existentializing it, explaining some special experience that Christianity is based on, and claim that this is what the early Christian community was like.

7
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:39,959
They're going to say they're going to save Christianity from not only what I just said, theology and metaphysics, but another way to put it, reflective, detached, theoretical thinking.

8
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:50,760
And that takes the form of Kierkegaard being against Hegel, which was the culmination of the philosophical tradition up to him.

9
00:01:51,120 --> 00:02:02,399
And I thought it's sort of the end of it, as far as a great tradition that made sense of everything in terms of its account of the Supreme Being and how everything else got its meaning in terms of that.

10
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:19,519
They're also going to drop not only the philosophical, metaphysical supreme being story, but the other aspect from the Greeks is natural science, which the Enlightenment took up.

11
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:24,639
And they also are going to not reject natural science.

12
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,959
I don't know what Kierkegaard thinks about science, but I think he thinks it's okay.

13
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:37,039
In fact, I guess I do remember places where he talks about it gets you objective truth, he says.

14
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,000
And if you want objective truth, he has nothing against it.

15
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,959
But you can't live your life in terms of objective truth.

16
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:48,959
There, he's very much against thinking that it's a good thing to be a kind of theoretical being.

17
00:02:48,959 --> 00:03:06,800
You can do science, but he thinks it's a bad idea if you sort of identify your life with science and think that you should deal with your life according to the detached, objective, theoretical way that science rightly deals with the universe.

18
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:11,679
So I think Kierkegaard, and we know Dostoevsky, thinks science is fine.

19
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:14,639
I mean, you don't mess with physics and chemistry.

20
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:23,440
It's just a bad idea, however, to think that you can understand your life in terms of physics and chemistry.

21
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:47,720
And you mustn't get to the point, remember Dostoevsky, where you think you should understand, you could interpret the meaningful existential experiences of human beings in a way that either scientific psychology or chemistry or neuroscience with its neurons and so forth would have any relevance whatsoever.

22
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:59,320
So the way you live your life is one thing, and the scientific description of the objective universe and your objective body and your objective brain is something else.

23
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,080
And so they all share that.

24
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:08,360
Everything that's Greek, which I now want to say is again theology and science, they are against it.

25
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,440
They meaning all of them.

26
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:17,080
Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky, and now we're going to find Nietzsche.

27
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:23,400
Nietzsche also thinks science is okay, but it's meaningless, as he says.

28
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:36,520
And he definitely thinks that the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the God of Plato, the supreme being, is a big mistake.

29
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:42,600
And you'll see in his language, our longest lie of the Western tradition.

30
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:54,360
And so behind it all, just to remind you, way back to the first lecture, is Pascal, who started all this modern or anti-modern.

31
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,240
It's modern in the sense that it's our current form of Christianity, I think, of Judeo-Christianity.

32
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:12,280
But it's anti-modern, if modern means the Enlightenment, which comes, which takes over the Greeks and thinks that science and philosophy have the answers to everything.

33
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:16,840
So, whatever you want to say about Pascal, he's the beginning of existential thinking.

34
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:23,200
And remember, he says the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is not the God of the philosophers.

35
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:32,560
It's not even Jehovah when you get done with Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky, because for Kierkegaard, God is that all things are possible.

36
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:36,880
And for Dostoevsky, God is the connectedness of all beings.

37
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:46,800
And there's no place in there for a supreme being, and certainly not for a personal supreme being.

38
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,519
But Pascal already started describing the life of what it is to be a Christian.

39
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:55,760
That was what was important.

40
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:19,200
So you're going to get rid of everything in Christianity that in any way messes up the supposed joyful new experience that Jesus brought to people, or in Dostoevsky, then Markle.

41
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,600
That means dumping all sorts of things.

42
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:45,280
Magic, that is miracles that go against the laws of physics and chemistry, and Platonism, that is some God outside the world in eternity and outside of time, and Protestantism, you have to throw in, which is this isolated individual before God.

43
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:59,920
And the last on that list that we just finished with Dostoevsky, masochism of some sort, the idea that the basis of the message of Jesus is suffering on the cross and death.

44
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,600
And all they're interested in is all Dostoevsky's interested in.

45
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,840
And Kierkegaard, too, I think, is incarnation.

46
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,240
That is, that God got into space and time and showed up as a person.

47
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:20,440
And they're interested in resurrection, that everybody needs to be reborn and can be reborn.

48
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:24,040
Those are the big deal existential messages.

49
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:40,040
That will get you back to the joyful existential truth of the early, really Judeo-Christian community, because they were Jews who were Christians, and they combined insights from both.

50
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:43,560
And now, where does Nietzsche fit into that?

51
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:52,039
Well, as I said, he's just as anti-Greek and Socrates and Plato and philosophy as you can get.

52
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,920
But he goes one step further.

53
00:07:54,919 --> 00:08:04,840
He rejects the metaphysical philosophical content of current Christianity, like Kierkegaard does and Dostoevsky does.

54
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:10,200
And he rejects also completely the Christian way of life.

55
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,960
That's the new move.

56
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:16,280
He doesn't want to go back to the early Christian community.

57
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,760
He thinks that's part of the problem.

58
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:24,840
You'll see, he thinks that there is this, I can tell you this, you won't understand it yet, but it's interesting.

59
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:29,079
He thinks that Christianity lost it from the moment it got started.

60
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:41,880
He says the only good Christian died on the cross, meaning you'll see when you get to the Antichrist few lectures down the line, he thinks that Jesus was very close to having things right.

61
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,639
But as soon as it fell into the hands of Paul and so forth, it was completely messed up.

62
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:52,719
And so that nobody even had a chance to live as a Christian.

63
00:08:53,039 --> 00:09:01,280
He just does, I mean, the complicated thing is, I mean, Nietzsche has a very different idea of what these early Christians must have been like.

64
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,720
I think he would like the Dostoevsky picture of the early Christian community.

65
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,360
We could ask ourselves that when we get there.

66
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,320
He certainly wouldn't like anything in Kierkegaard.

67
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:12,880
You'll see that.

68
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:24,320
The Kierkegaard notion of unconditional commitment is something Nietzsche would find very confining or something like that.

69
00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:25,440
We'll get to that.

70
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:28,479
He says conviction, he says commitments are prisons.

71
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,280
Confining is a good word for it.

72
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,959
But that's, you want to say something?

73
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,840
Good.

74
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,440
That's good.

75
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,680
Yeah?

76
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,120
Did he say that?

77
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:51,120
Where did you read that or hear that?

78
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,080
That's interesting.

79
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:53,039
Can you hear her?

80
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:57,039
The Pope recommends and likes the brothers Karamazov.

81
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,479
We have to take this into account.

82
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,760
Go ahead.

83
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,040
The Wikipedia article.

84
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,519
I see.

85
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,480
Okay, so now the news is from the web that the Pope likes the brothers.

86
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,000
What does he say about it?

87
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,280
Like the Brothers Karamatso?

88
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,399
Anybody else interesting on this list?

89
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,399
Sigmund Freud, yes, I've mentioned that to some of you.

90
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:34,240
I think after class, Freud thought that the idea that when Yvonne says every man wants to kill his father, this was very Freudian and had it.

91
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,320
He wrote a whole article about the brothers Kermatsov.

92
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,040
Yeah.

93
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:39,639
Okay, now why?

94
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,519
See, why would the Pope like it?

95
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:44,200
Let me think a minute.

96
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:51,480
But it's not, he does, obviously, he doesn't think he's the Grand Inquisitor.

97
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,639
But Dostoevsky thinks he's the Grand Inquisitor.

98
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:57,720
And so now what are we going to do about that?

99
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:05,319
Well, because certainly, I mean, from a Dostoevsky point of view, the Catholic Church is just as wrong for Protestants.

100
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:07,159
I mean, it's turning, but what's it got?

101
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:12,120
It's turned community into a bunch of a credo that everybody can believe.

102
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:17,960
It thinks that the whole world should be all converted to Christendom, or at least it used to.

103
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,760
I don't know what the current Pope thinks.

104
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,960
And it got rid of God.

105
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,320
That's pretty serious.

106
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:29,560
God as a supreme being.

107
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,320
But what?

108
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:32,440
Maybe he doesn't understand it.

109
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,320
Well, that's what I'm beginning to think as I talk out.

110
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:38,519
Or that's the uncharitable interpretation.

111
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:46,839
The uncharitable interpretation is he likes the account of agape and then the love and joy side of Christianity.

112
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:57,159
And he's ready to sort of forgive Dostoevsky for these other heresies because it is a wonderful defense of a version of the Christian way of life.

113
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:10,919
Certainly a good friend of mine, Charles Taylor, whom you don't know, but who's probably the most intellectual, philosophical, famous Catholic philosopher, loves Dostoevsky.

114
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,440
I have to ask him how he reconciles this.

115
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,039
I'll see what he has to say.

116
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:25,279
Because he does believe in the Supreme Being, but he likes, I think he just probably, they probably just think, well, Dostoevsky's wrong on that one, but he's right on so many other aspects of the Christian life.

117
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,159
Good.

118
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:28,080
Of course, he's against confession.

119
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,119
I mean, we can line up what he's against.

120
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:32,799
It doesn't leave all that much.

121
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,639
Just joy, maybe, which is a good thing.

122
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,359
Although, Pope Benedict doesn't strike me as particularly joyful.

123
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,440
I think we should stop discussing this and go back to your work.

124
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,359
I'm glad to hear it, anyway.

125
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,559
Anybody else have anything to say about this?

126
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,920
Okay, let's go on then.

127
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,359
Where is on?

128
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:06,559
So now we're going to do just a little, something I don't normally do at all, but I can't resist giving you some historical background and context for Nietzsche.

129
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,720
It's not the usual sort of existentialist thing to do.

130
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,039
It doesn't matter what the facts are.

131
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,399
It sort of matters how they live their lives.

132
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:25,519
So Heidegger, whom I mention every once in a while, or Kierkegaard too, sort of puts the facts of history just out of it.

133
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:34,159
I mean, Kierkegaard says that all you need to know about Jesus is that he, what is it, that he was a case of eternity and time.

134
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,159
Everything else is irrelevant.

135
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:43,599
What morality he preached, that he was a carpenter, that anything, according to Kierkegaard.

136
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:48,799
It's just that God became a human being at a certain place, at a certain time.

137
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,000
That's it.

138
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,199
And the who was that I'm going to say next?

139
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,079
Wait a second.

140
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,080
Besides, oh, Kierkegaard?

141
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:09,880
Oh, I was, it's, it's, Heidegger says himself that when he was teaching an Aristotle course, his courses, you can get them all, dozens of them, published.

142
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:17,079
Anyway, says about Aristotle, all you need to know about Aristotle is he lived, he did philosophy, and he died.

143
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:18,760
Now let's turn to the text.

144
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:25,240
So, and I sort of like that, but I'm so I'm apologizing for the fact that I'm going to give you a little bit of historical background.

145
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,720
They would consider it useless gossip, I think.

146
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:40,760
But so it turns out that Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky and Nietzsche all wrote at roughly the same time, around 1850.

147
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:49,960
And then, so Kierkegaard first, in 1850, that's when the time for fear and trembling, roughly.

148
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:55,319
Then Dostoevsky and Nietzsche, in a way, were at exactly the same time.

149
00:14:55,319 --> 00:15:01,159
The Brothers Karamatsov is published in 1881, and The Gay Science in 1882.

150
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:06,440
You see, that's the kind of trivial fact that no one could resist mentioning.

151
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:12,279
And then the Twilight and The Antichrist are from 1888.

152
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:19,880
So this raises one interesting question, which you should keep in the back of your mind, and I'm ready to hear any suggestions you've got.

153
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:21,480
You'll see me worrying about it.

154
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:28,839
It is not, nobody knows how much Dostoevsky Nietzsche read, though it was available in German.

155
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,439
We'll come back to that.

156
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:37,799
Is there any evidence you should be asking yourself as you read the Nietzsche that Dostoevsky read the Brothers Karamatsov?

157
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:41,480
It's more likely, it looks like, that he read The Idiot, if he read any.

158
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,799
But it's fun to keep in mind.

159
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,440
There are hints, I think.

160
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,480
Maybe he did read The Brothers Kerenatsov.

161
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,679
So let's go on.

162
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,519
So, how much does Nietzsche know of his two greatest opponents?

163
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,159
Because he really, and Pascal was his third favorite opponent.

164
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:07,679
He really likes these people who share the whole anti-Platonic, anti-philosophical approach with him.

165
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,720
And so he feels that they're on the same wavelength.

166
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,240
And then he sees that they accept the Christian way of life.

167
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,240
That makes them the big existential opponents.

168
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,199
And so I'll read you some quotes about all that.

169
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,960
First, he'd heard about Kierkegaard, but he didn't have time to read him.

170
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:40,000
His best friend, Georg Brandes, wrote to him in 1888, that's when he's writing Twilight and Antichrist: quote: There is a Nordic thinker, Soren Kierkegaard, whose works would interest you if only they were translated.

171
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,879
See, unfortunately, they aren't in German.

172
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:44,160
They're only in Danish.

173
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,439
So that's a problem.

174
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:56,319
And he goes on, he is, in my view, this quote Georg Brandes says, one of the deepest psychologists on the whole there has ever, that there has ever been.

175
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:07,679
Where psychologist obviously doesn't mean somebody, existential psychologist who understanding of despair and being reborn and important things like that.

176
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:15,760
Nietzsche answers, for my next trip to Germany, I've resolved to occupy myself with the psychological problem of Kierkegaard.

177
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:27,600
Now, I don't know whether Nietzsche thinks he can read Danish or whether he supposes that by his next trip, he will be able to, that they will be translated.

178
00:17:28,399 --> 00:17:35,360
But he doesn't get to, because Nietzsche, you know, you do know or probably know reading any of the introductions and stuff.

179
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:50,760
Nietzsche cracked up and went just totally crazy, but not in a dramatic sort of way first, raving and banging on the piano and saying that he was Jesus and Dionysius, and then sort of relapsed into a kind of coma for 11 years.

180
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:58,279
And that all happened so quickly after 1888, I don't know exactly the date, that he never got to read Kierkegaard.

181
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:02,119
But he did get involved in a way with Dostoevsky.

182
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,879
And you can see about that.

183
00:18:03,879 --> 00:18:05,400
Maybe some of you noticed.

184
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:29,240
Has anybody noticed the notes in Twilight where they talked about Dostoevsky on 202 of Twilight in a footnote of a glossary of names when they decide to explain who Feodor Dostoevsky was, we have a quote from Nietzsche.

185
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,919
A few weeks ago, I did not even know the name of Dostoevsky.

186
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,839
A chance reach in a bookstore brought to my notice a work just translated into French.

187
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:41,399
Maybe that's how he's supposed to read Kierkegaard.

188
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:45,799
L'Esprit sout terrain, which is Notes from Underground.

189
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:50,439
The instinct of kinship, or what shall I call it, spoke immediately.

190
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,839
My joy was extraordinary.

191
00:18:53,160 --> 00:19:00,519
So, and then it's skipping a little, whether he read all or any of the four great novels is unknown and so forth.

192
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:13,000
And on page 110 of Twilight, I assigned just this page 110 because I wanted you to just see it about two-thirds of the way down.

193
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,199
He says, Dostoevsky, the only psychologist, by the way, from whom I had anything to learn.

194
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,880
He's one of the happiest accidents of my life, even more than my discovery of Stendahl.

195
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:29,199
This profound human being who was ten times justified in despising the superficial Germans.

196
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,640
That's just an aside.

197
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:39,599
Kierkegaard, Nietzsche is Swiss, and German is his native language, from Basel, but he doesn't like the Germans at all.

198
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:41,359
I don't know if he likes the Swiss either.

199
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:42,240
I doubt it.

200
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:49,039
But there's probably no country, no culture he likes, but he dislikes Germans, particularly.

201
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,720
And so does Dostoevsky.

202
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,440
The only nice thing he ever says about Germans is Dr.

203
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,320
Herritzenstuck, the one who gave Dmitri the nuts.

204
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:02,960
Usually Germans are doctors in Dostoevsky, and usually they don't understand what's really going on.

205
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,240
They think it's brain fever, whereas it's really revelation.

206
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,799
Yeah.

207
00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:25,919
Nietzsche.

208
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,480
The East is better than West.

209
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,199
I doubt it.

210
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:38,559
You have to show me that because at least Buddhism he can't stand because, of course, he's all for passionate involvement.

211
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,039
Non-attachment and meditation are just not his thing at all.

212
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,439
And so what he would find in the East, I don't know.

213
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:57,519
But of course, he doesn't like the West either because the West has been sold out since Homer, which he likes a lot, has been lost, so to speak, to anything good.

214
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:04,079
So, Nietzsche, Nietzsche has a hard time because he really sees through so much that other people accept.

215
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:33,799
And there's this, he has this line that he's doing philosophy with a hammer, which means not only that he's sort of hitting you over the head with what he thinks, you must have had this feeling when you read it, that he's sort of in your face, kind of screaming at you all the time and saying outrageous things, but he's, and that's his, so to speak, protest against the very style of doing philosophy, which was calm and ordered and reflective and impersonal.

216
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:47,000
For him, it's extremely involved and disordered and personal, and he just studies philosophy, but he doesn't really want to write that way.

217
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,200
Why am I saying this?

218
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,800
I get off of this strange tax.

219
00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:53,320
Let me think of a minute.

220
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:57,640
Oh, about East and West.

221
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:10,599
Oh, yeah, just that he's against all of this, and that his style would be the furthest from any kind of serenity, which he would probably think of as Eastern.

222
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:18,039
And his style is also farthest from any kind of theoretical rationality, which he thinks of as Western.

223
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,640
So I was just saying, well, with a hammer.

224
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,519
Now I got it back.

225
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:31,559
When he says he philosophizes with a hammer, he doesn't really mean that he's hitting you over the head with everything, although he does that, and it's important that he does that, because he's so radical breaking with it.

226
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:39,879
But he says he's testing all the ideas that people believe in, and sort of knocking them to see if they're hollow.

227
00:22:39,879 --> 00:22:41,560
And they all turn out to be hollow.

228
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:47,639
He's the most rectangular questioner that everybody believes that ever was, I think.

229
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:56,560
And after Nietzsche, it's very much harder to believe in a lot of the things that people believed in before he went around hitting them with a hammer.

230
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,640
So, where were we?

231
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,079
You want to say something?

232
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:06,079
Read your mind?

233
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:07,119
Go ahead, what?

234
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,920
By Socrates?

235
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,519
Yes.

236
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,119
Yes.

237
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,679
He said, it seems like Socrates testing beliefs to see if they hold up.

238
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,399
Yes.

239
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,599
And why is it so radically different than Socrates?

240
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:29,599
There's something way that Socrates tests them, which is something that he disapproves of completely.

241
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:30,960
What would it be?

242
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:40,960
I forget how many of you, I think I asked you this, have read any Socrates, have read the Apology and Prato and things that people do read in high school sometimes.

243
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:50,639
And okay, well, Socrates, you wouldn't know this then, but he's going around testing all these Athenian beliefs by rational means.

244
00:23:50,640 --> 00:24:05,839
He's seeing how much they can be defended against any objections and how they can be self-critical and stand up to and be shown to be reasonable or else be rejected.

245
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:08,559
I mean, that's not how Nietzsche's tested.

246
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,840
Nietzsche's testing them in a much more what?

247
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,240
He would say genealogical way.

248
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:28,639
He's trying to tell you sort of how they developed, what needs that people had that they helped, and how they kept people from being strong and mature, and is what's wrong with them.

249
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:49,079
And Socrates, this is part of today's lecture, and Socrates is, after all, remember, you can read it, is the ultimate decadent, because Socrates needs rational arguments to defend what he's doing and tell him what to do.

250
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:53,720
Nietzsche thinks that's all wrong in the name of something very interesting.

251
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,319
We'll get to it in a minute.

252
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:56,599
So, where are we?

253
00:24:56,839 --> 00:25:01,159
I'm just reading, okay, on 110, did I read it?

254
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,879
Yes.

255
00:25:01,879 --> 00:25:14,439
Okay, so now it's funny what I'm reading is different than what I wrote here.

256
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,480
So I have to think about this.

257
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,400
Very interesting.

258
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,279
Where does he say what I have written down here?

259
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:37,400
I've written the following as if it was on Twilight page 110, but I don't see it.

260
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,559
If you see it, let me know.

261
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:41,159
And if it isn't there, where could it be?

262
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:49,000
But here is what I quote: Nietzsche says, ah, maybe that's what I just read on 202.

263
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:57,559
No, I don't know where it is.

264
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:58,440
It's interesting.

265
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:06,760
He says to somebody, I treasure him, that's Dostoevsky, as the most valuable psychological material I know.

266
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:12,599
I am in a remarkable way thankful to him, even though he always goes against my deepest instincts.

267
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:20,039
Similar to my relation to Pascal, whom I almost love because he's taught me so much, the only logical Christian.

268
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:26,240
That is, Pascal is completely wrong, but he's wrong in this very deep way.

269
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:27,440
Now, where?

270
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,319
I don't see that.

271
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:29,519
Do you see that?

272
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:30,960
Where did I get it?

273
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,839
Well, if I can't find it in a minute, I just go to you next tonight.

274
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,319
Okay, I don't know where I got it.

275
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,959
So, now, did Dostoevsky know any Nietzsche?

276
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,240
That's the next question.

277
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,319
No, but it's much more interesting.

278
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:52,000
Much more interesting than sort of history of influences, as far as I've been.

279
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,119
Dostoevsky was such a genius, he made up Nietzsche.

280
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:59,199
There's a character in the possessed named Kirilov, who's very Nietzschean.

281
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,319
There is a lot of Nietzsche talk in the brothers Karamatsov.

282
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:06,480
We haven't paid attention to it, but we're going to.

283
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,440
That's why you should bring the brothers back again.

284
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:24,959
Dostoevsky is making up exactly the position that, well, lots of positions that Nietzsche holds.

285
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,720
There was one just going across my mind.

286
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:32,639
I'm thinking.

287
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,440
No, I think it would get out of the order to do it now, so let's not talk about that yet.

288
00:27:42,879 --> 00:27:59,839
So it turns out then that Dostoevsky and Nietzsche have a lot in common, Dostoevsky says, Nietzsche says, and I think Dostoevsky would agree in the sense that he made him up and knows his views without ever having read a word of him.

289
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:04,879
So we're going to look at what they have in common today for the rest of the time.

290
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,119
And I'm going to put off until later what it is they disagree about.

291
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:23,480
I've already said they disagree about whether it's a good thing or a bad thing to live, the kind of life that Dostoevsky thinks is the Christian life, and say whether it's nice to be like Alyosha, a good thing or not.

292
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,079
We'll worry about that later.

293
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:38,839
Finally, and then when we do, just to sort of show where we are, because we're so near the end of the course, trying to see how Nietzsche's like Dostoevsky, then we can see how he's not like Dostoevsky.

294
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,680
And in the end, you have to ask yourself, sort of which side are you on, because they're so radically opposed.

295
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:58,279
In the last lecture, we have to talk about how you would decide what's at stake who you like and think has important advice to give you.

296
00:28:58,279 --> 00:28:59,959
But that's ahead of the story.

297
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:01,399
So let's go back.

298
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,479
We start with Nietzsche on the Homeric Greeks.

299
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:18,840
We're going to see later what Nietzsche has to say about the Athenian Greeks, philosophical Greeks, is going to look a lot like Dostoevsky.

300
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:39,480
But before we do that, we have to look at a distinction, which, if you don't know it, will confuse you very much, because Nietzsche talks about the Greeks, and sometimes he means the Homeric Greeks, and sometimes he means the Greeks in Athens at the time of Socrates, which is about 700 years after Homer.

301
00:29:39,479 --> 00:29:49,960
And he's all for the Homeric Greeks, as you'll see in a minute, and totally against the Socratic Athenian philosophical Greeks.

302
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:55,439
And they're called Hellens, H-E-L-L-E-N-S, the Homeric ones.

303
00:29:55,439 --> 00:29:59,279
You just need to know that sort of like code to follow what's going on.

304
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:08,159
And the next stage is called Hellenistic, because it's a sort of, it's a kind of copy or something, or degeneration of the Hellens.

305
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:15,279
So he's for the Hellens, but he's against the Hellenistic Greeks.

306
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:19,919
And that's just, I say that only just so you won't be confused as you read it.

307
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:26,319
I wonder if they're in this list of names at the end, whether we, I never thought to look, whether they tell you about that.

308
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,399
No, they don't tell you.

309
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:29,200
Nobody tells you.

310
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,719
It just goes by.

311
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,439
Why they're called Helens, I don't know.

312
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:39,999
It has nothing to do with Helen of Troy, the wife of Agamemnon and stuff.

313
00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:40,639
I have no idea.

314
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,560
Does anybody over there know why these certain Greeks are called Helens?

315
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,040
Well, anyway, just keep your eye open.

316
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,760
So now we're going to read Nietzsche on the Greeks.

317
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,160
He thought these Homeric Greeks, how many read the Odyssey?

318
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:55,120
Hooray.

319
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,120
How many have read the Iliad?

320
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:57,920
Wow.

321
00:30:58,879 --> 00:31:01,039
Ahead of me, practically.

322
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,239
I mean, I read the Odyssey over and over, but the Iliad is too much for me.

323
00:31:04,879 --> 00:31:06,000
Read it once.

324
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:12,480
But anyway, I teach the Odyssey in Philosophy VI, but I dare do I teach the Iliad.

325
00:31:12,479 --> 00:31:24,799
So, but in both books, you can see the Greeks being passionate, involved, and, and now comes this interesting Nietzsche way of looking at it, trusting their instincts.

326
00:31:24,879 --> 00:31:27,120
That's what we have to talk about for a while.

327
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:36,760
Because it sounds like if you just use the normal word instinct, that it would mean something automatic, like birds had instincts for building nests and so forth.

328
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,440
But that's not at all what Nietzsche means by people's instincts.

329
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:45,080
It's not something that you are born with, something innate.

330
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:50,840
It's something you think you acquire by a long experience.

331
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:58,520
What makes it instinct for Nietzsche is that it's unreflective, spontaneous action.

332
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:15,959
And in all sorts of domains where, by lots of work and experience, you develop a skill so that you can just immediately, appropriately respond, then you've got that kind of good instinct.

333
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:28,680
For instance, in sports, if you're good at sports so that you hit the tennis ball exactly where you want to hit it, and just as soon as it's coming over the net, you're already running in the right direction.

334
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,000
That's your instinct for tennis.

335
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:33,480
Certainly, it isn't innate, you weren't born with it.

336
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:37,640
But what makes it an instinct is you don't think about it, you don't reflect.

337
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,160
If you stop to reflect, of course, you miss the point.

338
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,600
You can't reflect.

339
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,199
That's what's interesting about.

340
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:59,720
And the highest level of human behavior is instinctual in this sense: that people have all kinds of skills for dealing with other people, for sports, for music, for thinking, and reading, and so forth.

341
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:05,720
And when they are good at those, when they are at their best, they don't reflect.

342
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,279
They act spontaneously.

343
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:10,600
And if they do reflect, they're lost.

344
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,560
There's this baseball player.

345
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,999
I keep forgetting his name.

346
00:33:14,999 --> 00:33:16,600
Somebody knows each time.

347
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,960
Noblau, something like that.

348
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:20,319
Who, what?

349
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,159
Yeah, probably.

350
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,360
What's his name?

351
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:25,200
I can hear.

352
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,560
Yes, right, right.

353
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,279
Exactly.

354
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:36,799
Who, I don't know what became of him, but I was fascinated from a Nietzschean perspective that he started thinking about what he was doing.

355
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,439
And as soon as he, he was, what, an outfielder?

356
00:33:39,439 --> 00:33:40,479
And as soon as he's.

357
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,120
What's that?

358
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,599
I couldn't hear you.

359
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,119
I see.

360
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,519
And when he did, he started thinking about what he was doing.

361
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,040
Is that when it happened?

362
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:02,080
Well, let's go through this because I'm very interested in this case.

363
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:25,200
And could he do it from the outfield okay?

364
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:27,999
That's what I thought.

365
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:35,200
I think he was out of baseball as soon as he started thinking about it because once you start thinking about it, then you start trying hard not to think about it.

366
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,399
And that doesn't help a bit.

367
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,600
It makes it worse.

368
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,399
I think he just became reflective.

369
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,799
He just, it's a perfectly Nietzschean, wonderful thing.

370
00:34:42,799 --> 00:34:45,360
It's as if he had suddenly become Socratic.

371
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:55,839
And any skill where you have this kind of instinct, if you start thinking about it and reflecting on it, you're finished.

372
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,920
You can't do it anymore.

373
00:34:57,919 --> 00:35:03,040
You probably can't even think about how you ride a bicycle or riding a bicycle without falling over.

374
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:17,319
So Nietzsche's got this wonderful idea that the whole philosophical tradition has missed this interesting point: that the highest form of human activity has to be unreflective.

375
00:35:17,319 --> 00:35:19,319
And you can't think about it.

376
00:35:19,319 --> 00:35:21,879
And even if you did, you wouldn't do you any good.

377
00:35:21,879 --> 00:35:32,200
I mean, not only, it doesn't do any good to think about it, there are no rules for how to throw the ball each time or play the beautiful, play the flute well or anything like that.

378
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:39,000
The rules, you may start with rules, but you leave them behind when you become a master or an expert.

379
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:43,400
And so there's no rules that you could possibly give somebody or find out.

380
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:46,840
So you wouldn't get anything positive from thinking about it.

381
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:51,640
But worse, you couldn't do it if you started thinking about it.

382
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:54,919
So Nietzsche's got onto something terrific.

383
00:35:54,919 --> 00:36:06,439
And on 59, he says at the bottom of the page: everything good is instinct.

384
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,520
The bottom of that section, out of the page.

385
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:13,319
Everything good is instinct and consequently easy, necessary, free.

386
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:15,400
Effort is an objection.

387
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:22,120
There's this funny story, a colleague of mine told me that he didn't like, Nietzsche didn't like Beethoven's music.

388
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:27,640
And what he said about it was, to explain that he didn't like it, is that Beethoven's music sweats.

389
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,399
I mean, this is just another example.

390
00:36:29,399 --> 00:36:30,519
I mean, it's too effortful.

391
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,479
He tries too hard.

392
00:36:31,479 --> 00:36:33,559
He has to write everything over and over again.

393
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,279
I mean, Mozart just wrote it down easily.

394
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:37,879
So Nietzsche should like Mozart.

395
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:40,760
But in fact, his favorite composer was Bizet.

396
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,840
And you can make what you can of that.

397
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:44,599
Nietzsche actually composed music.

398
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,519
You can get a CD of Nietzsche music.

399
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,720
It's terrible, absolutely hopeful.

400
00:36:48,279 --> 00:36:53,839
So we won't go on about that.

401
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:59,119
But on page 59, about five lines down, he says more of this.

402
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:06,560
A well-constituted human being, a happy one, must perform certain actions instinctively, shrinks from other actions.

403
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:14,080
He transports the order of which he is the physiological representative into his relations with other human beings and with things.

404
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:18,560
In a formula, his virtue is a consequence of his happiness.

405
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:19,760
Never mind that.

406
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,599
That's not going to help any.

407
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:26,720
But mainly, what you get is the idea, now what would it be to be a good person?

408
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:32,880
Now, not just a good baseball player at second bass or a good flute player, but a good human being.

409
00:37:32,879 --> 00:37:41,999
Well, he has in mind what other people have called, Aristotle, in fact, called a man of practical wisdom.

410
00:37:41,999 --> 00:37:48,560
It would be a woman or a man who had learned how to be an expert in their culture.

411
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:55,120
So that, as Aristotle put it, they always do the appropriate thing at the appropriate time in the appropriate way.

412
00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:00,159
That is, and to some extent, you're all on the way to doing that.

413
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:05,279
You maybe once had to learn the rule, never tell a lie.

414
00:38:05,279 --> 00:38:13,119
But then later you would learn, if you were, and I think Nietzsche's right, you learn that that doesn't work, that kind of rule.

415
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:23,760
You learn, as one of my TAs pointed out, a kid learns that after they've been at a birthday party in which the ice cream was melted and everybody was fighting and the parents kept saying, boys, it's dreadful.

416
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,600
As the parents leave, they tell the other parents, we had a wonderful time.

417
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,799
And then the kid thinks, but they told me I never should tell a lie.

418
00:38:30,799 --> 00:38:32,799
And then he has to have a new rule.

419
00:38:32,799 --> 00:38:36,680
Well, never tell a lie unless it makes people feel better, or something like that.

420
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:42,839
But that won't work either, because sometimes you should tell people the truth, even if it makes them feel bad, it'll help in the long run.

421
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,279
Or even if it doesn't, you should.

422
00:38:44,919 --> 00:39:07,319
But anyway, finally, if you tell truths and lies enough in lots of different situations and you're willing to suffer the consequences and feel bad when you do it wrong, meaning that it leads to some kind of mess, and good when you do it right, you finally understand how to be truthful, which is not the same as telling the truth all the time or not telling the truth any other time.

423
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:21,960
It's being skilled, having an instinct, automatically, just the words come out of your mouth, that is either the hard truth that the person needs to hear or some kind of way of avoiding covering up the truth.

424
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:26,279
And that's what it is to become a person of practical wisdom.

425
00:39:26,919 --> 00:39:30,920
And they are the best that the culture can produce.

426
00:39:30,919 --> 00:39:34,600
There's another writer who calls them cultural virtuosos.

427
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,840
That is, you too can do this.

428
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:52,520
Maybe you are already to some extent able to do what in your culture is what is recognized, at least in retrospect, as having been the right thing to do.

429
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:57,000
And that's the person that Nietzsche admires.

430
00:39:56,999 --> 00:40:00,279
And notice it's not a philosopher.

431
00:40:00,279 --> 00:40:07,959
And it doesn't require passing through logic and mediation and reflection at all.

432
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:10,599
You may have to start with rules, probably not.

433
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,880
All kids don't have to learn rules.

434
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:16,440
And you certainly have to leave rules behind.

435
00:40:16,439 --> 00:40:20,519
You can't get there by logic or rules.

436
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:28,240
You get there by experience, involvement, taking risks, and learning from your mistakes.

437
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:33,440
That's Nietzsche's picture of how you become a good person.

438
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,359
Now, let's see who we are.

439
00:40:35,999 --> 00:40:40,799
That gives you perfection in living, as he calls it, somewhere here, I think.

440
00:40:40,799 --> 00:40:43,599
Didn't I just read that, or did I just write that?

441
00:40:46,959 --> 00:40:49,999
I guess that's my way of calling it.

442
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:57,199
Perfection in living is what you get when you do, if you're a culturo virtuoso.

443
00:40:59,919 --> 00:41:02,000
And okay, here's what I was going to say next.

444
00:41:01,999 --> 00:41:05,520
But notice that it's a higher immediacy of a weird sort.

445
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,080
That's really interesting to me.

446
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:32,480
I mean, both Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, and I'm sure Dostoevsky too, would be against lower immediacy, which is just sort of doing whatever spontaneously comes into your mind without having developed any skill, without having gone through the risks of telling lies when you should have told the truth in retrospect and vice versa, and whatever, learning to be a second baseman and not have to think about it.

447
00:41:32,879 --> 00:41:36,399
Once you've done that, you're not in lower immediacy anymore.

448
00:41:36,399 --> 00:41:42,960
Because lower immediacy is just giving in to your spontaneous, untrained impulses.

449
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:44,719
And Nietzsche's not for that.

450
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,159
That's not instinct.

451
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,240
I don't know what his word for that would be.

452
00:41:48,240 --> 00:42:03,600
But you have to pass to higher immediacy, which is all this training that you go through by learning, but without reflecting, trying, and making mistakes, and getting wise in your whatever domain you're in.

453
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:09,480
But that's a kind of higher immediacy that you get to without going through mediation.

454
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:20,040
And mediation wouldn't help, and of course, mediation might stick you there if you were like the guy who, the second base person.

455
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:24,600
And if you get too reflective, you won't be able to ever get to this.

456
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,159
So Nietzsche's got this very interesting idea.

457
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:45,240
He can share the philosophical distrust of people who just act on their impulses and come up with a view that there is a higher way of acting instinctively on your impulses, which is the highest thing human beings.

458
00:42:45,879 --> 00:42:56,760
And so you don't act like a child, not that kind of spontaneity, not just giving in to every desire and every impulse.

459
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:02,840
You act out of long experience, and that makes you focused and effective.

460
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:07,240
And that's what the wise people acquire.

461
00:43:09,479 --> 00:43:13,319
And then they can just immediately, directly act.

462
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:24,279
Another example, by the way, how much, I mean, you might think that chess players at least have to think that that's reflective and mediated and analytic.

463
00:43:24,279 --> 00:43:26,279
But some of you probably are chess players.

464
00:43:26,279 --> 00:43:40,519
And if you are, you may know that chess grandmasters, after lots of chess experience, playing maybe a million games, because they have to play games sort of day and night, not only real games, but go through all the book games or now play the computer and so forth.

465
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:50,080
But finally, if you're a grandmaster, you can play chess, it blitz chess, at, say, 10 seconds a move and play at pretty master level.

466
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:59,600
Or you can play, you know, 20 people at once, which you couldn't have, you don't stop at each board and figure out what's happening and what happened up to now and what you were going to do next.

467
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,360
You just look at the board and your arm goes out and does something.

468
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:09,519
And that can, at the extreme, this is really Nietzsche would love this, blitz chess.

469
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,160
Yeah, you play at one second a move.

470
00:44:12,799 --> 00:44:19,520
The masters are just, their arms are just going out and making a move before they can even take in what's on the board.

471
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,639
And they don't need to.

472
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:37,360
If you train your instincts enough, if you really get to this level of mastery, then you can, without any reflection, play better chess than anybody of us could ever play who was trying to figure out what to do.

473
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:40,319
Okay, so that's, I'm just a big pitch for Nietzsche on this.

474
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,799
I think it's a great idea that he's got there.

475
00:44:45,680 --> 00:45:02,880
And now, again, if you're a good person in a culture and you're a kind of grand master of the culture, then so you take advantage of or get the most out of every situation, because that's just like making the master level move in that situation.

476
00:45:02,879 --> 00:45:06,319
On 189, he's talking about this.

477
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:23,440
He's talking about how you could get the law, which would be, I'm back to saying the law might be something like never tell a lie.

478
00:45:23,439 --> 00:45:26,639
But then what you want is you've got to live it.

479
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,440
You can't just take it as a kind of law.

480
00:45:29,439 --> 00:45:34,079
It has to become unconscious, where unconscious means unreflective.

481
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,680
It's nothing sort of Freudian.

482
00:45:36,919 --> 00:45:40,199
So that a complete automatism of instinct is achieved.

483
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,279
Again, that doesn't mean that you become like a machine.

484
00:45:44,279 --> 00:45:47,720
It just means that you become totally unreflective.

485
00:45:47,959 --> 00:45:52,919
It's the precondition of any kind of mastery and a kind of perfection in the art of living.

486
00:45:52,919 --> 00:45:54,919
Oh, that's where I got the.

487
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:02,600
And I think that's all I need to say about that.

488
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:02,999
Yeah.

489
00:46:03,959 --> 00:46:07,720
So that's more that I've said about all I want to say about instinct.

490
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:23,000
To sum up, noble instinct, which the Homeric Greeks had, is the source of impulsive, spontaneous, unreflective, but totally successful action.

491
00:46:22,999 --> 00:46:24,440
Generally successful.

492
00:46:24,439 --> 00:46:28,680
Something may be different than you realize that your past training may lead you astray.

493
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:38,920
But basically, you do the appropriate thing at the appropriate time in the appropriate way, and you, in a sense, win at whatever you're doing.

494
00:46:39,879 --> 00:46:44,680
And now, so much for the Homeric Greeks.

495
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,760
Now we get to the Socratic Greeks.

496
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:50,440
They had lost it.

497
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:54,120
That's what he's talking about on page 43.

498
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:59,400
And this is typically radical new Nietzschean idea.

499
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:15,639
You've got to realize, and since most of you haven't been reading yet, Socrates' defense, Plato's defense of Socrates and what a great guy he was because he made all the Athenians reflect and justify anything they did.

500
00:47:17,399 --> 00:47:20,279
That's the hero of our culture, Socrates.

501
00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:24,240
Plato was a great, what does he need?

502
00:47:25,999 --> 00:47:31,360
Who are the people you hire to put the right spin on what you're doing?

503
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,399
Sort of a press agent or what's agent?

504
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,480
There's another word for it, isn't there?

505
00:47:37,999 --> 00:47:39,839
Yes, a public relations person.

506
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:43,199
Yeah, Plato was a great public relations person for Socrates.

507
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:48,959
He put this incredible spin on it, how great Socrates was for Athens, what luck they had to have him.

508
00:47:48,959 --> 00:47:51,359
The Athenians were smart enough not to buy it.

509
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,360
They weren't completely decadent yet.

510
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:58,720
And they thought that he was a disaster for reasons that you ought to be able to figure out.

511
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,760
If you haven't figured it out, you think about it.

512
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:13,519
He's telling these people who presumably have at least some remaining instincts about what's the right and wrong thing to do, that they shouldn't do anything until they reflect on it and justify it.

513
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:23,520
He goes around stopping everybody on the three corners and asking them why are they doing what they are doing, which they thought they just knew what they were doing.

514
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:28,559
And they discover they can't explain what they were doing, and they sort of again become like the second baseman.

515
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,839
They aren't able to do anything.

516
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:33,760
By the time they leave Socrates, they're just in a kind of trance.

517
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:53,279
They know that he's taken away from them their ability to do what they were doing, and he hasn't given them really any ability to justify what they're doing, because it turns out Socrates is always, he's got this pure, critical kind of intelligence, which has nothing constructive to say.

518
00:48:53,279 --> 00:48:58,400
And so Nietzsche thinks he's a very bad guy.

519
00:48:58,399 --> 00:49:03,919
And interestingly enough, Kierkegaard wrote his PhD thesis on Socrates.

520
00:49:03,919 --> 00:49:05,760
It was called The Concept of Irony.

521
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:18,520
And Kierkegaard thought that Socrates was an interesting case of somebody who undermined the values of the culture.

522
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,240
Because the values of the culture aren't rational.

523
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:27,799
And you can't define why it's rational to do what the ethics of that culture says to do.

524
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:30,920
It just is what the ethics of that culture says to do.

525
00:49:30,919 --> 00:49:36,600
There is no right answer about what you're saying, Nietzsche thinks.

526
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,799
So the so, and Kierkegaard thinks.

527
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:58,760
So Socrates, by questioning the values, the morals of the Greeks, insofar as he succeeded, undermined their intuitive ability to do what in that culture was the appropriate thing to do.

528
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:02,279
So Socrates turns out to be dangerous.

529
00:50:02,279 --> 00:50:07,000
And now we read a lot about Socrates in here, where Nietzsche is sort of taking him apart.

530
00:50:07,959 --> 00:50:25,879
What he says is that in the essence of Socrates, the instincts had become, as he puts it, about six lines down on 43, the instincts, no, no, no, not the, four lines down.

531
00:50:25,879 --> 00:50:28,760
Everywhere the instincts were in anarchy.

532
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,360
Everywhere people were but five steps from excess.

533
00:50:32,359 --> 00:50:34,360
They had monstrous souls.

534
00:50:34,359 --> 00:50:36,440
And that was the universal danger.

535
00:50:36,439 --> 00:50:41,159
That means they couldn't count on what they just did spontaneously.

536
00:50:41,959 --> 00:50:43,880
So now it's sort of complicated.

537
00:50:43,879 --> 00:50:47,960
Instinct means acting just spontaneously without reflection.

538
00:50:47,959 --> 00:50:52,880
If you're healthy, psychologically, that's good.

539
00:50:53,200 --> 00:51:03,840
But if you've lost your healthy psycho estate, then just doing what you spontaneously feel like doing is back in lower immediacy.

540
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:11,760
So the Athenians, for reasons that he doesn't go into, but just so you can sort of see that this isn't just craziness on Nietzsche's part.

541
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:19,200
Thucydides, in his story about the Peloponnesian Wars, he sort of explains how the Athenians fell apart.

542
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:29,040
They were just wonderfully instinctive and had a kind of consensus about what to do, but then they had a plague which wiped out a whole lot of them.

543
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,480
Then they got in a war trying to be an empire.

544
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,079
And then they started sending out, you know, they had a direct democracy.

545
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,839
So every day they could vote on what to do.

546
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:42,480
And then they'd send out the generals to attack some country, say Iraq now.

547
00:51:42,479 --> 00:51:46,559
And then they'd change their mind and they'd call the generals back and court-martial them.

548
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:49,840
And then they'd send some other general out to attack some other country.

549
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:53,279
They got completely confused and hopeless.

550
00:51:53,999 --> 00:51:59,119
And they were in this confused state just at the time that Plato and Socrates came along.

551
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,479
Nietzsche just takes that.

552
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:06,319
We know that for granted when he says that their instincts were an anarchy, because that's what Thucydides says.

553
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,160
Nobody knows anything about it except what they read in Thucydides.

554
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:18,640
So, and he says at the bottom of 42, Socrates saw behind his aristocratic Athenians.

555
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:24,160
He grasped that his case, the idiosyncrasy of his case, was already no longer exceptional.

556
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,479
His case was that he had lost his instincts.

557
00:52:26,959 --> 00:52:31,439
The same kind of degeneration was everywhere silently preparing itself.

558
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:33,680
The old Athens was coming to an end.

559
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:40,840
And Socrates understood that all the world had need of him, his expedient, his cure, his personal art of self-preservation.

560
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:47,000
Everywhere the instincts were in anarchy, and now skipping a little, the instincts want to play the tyrant.

561
00:52:46,999 --> 00:52:50,600
We must find a counter-tyrant who is stronger.

562
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:56,519
And then when you go down a little more, where's the counter-tyrant?

563
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,080
Well, the counter-tyrant is on the next section.

564
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:08,920
If you go down to section 10, if one needs to make a tyrant of reason, as Socrates did, then there must exist no little danger of something else playing the tyrant.

565
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:12,440
Rationality was at that time divined as a savior.

566
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:16,279
Neither Socrates nor his embolists were free to be rational or not.

567
00:53:16,279 --> 00:53:18,359
As they wished, it was dériguer.

568
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:20,440
It was their last expedient.

569
00:53:20,439 --> 00:53:31,799
The fanaticism with which the whole Greek thought throws itself at rationality, that means Socrates, Plato particularly, betrays a state of emergency.

570
00:53:31,799 --> 00:53:37,719
One was in peril, one had only one choice, either to perish or be absurdly rational.

571
00:53:38,439 --> 00:53:41,559
And that's so that's what happens according to him.

572
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,920
Let me just catch up.

573
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:45,799
Socrates is the prime example.

574
00:53:45,799 --> 00:53:56,120
And on 43, we've got that already.

575
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:03,079
That makes him a pseudo-Greek in the sense that he's not like the good old Homeric Greeks.

576
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,680
And this is where you've got to keep track of who's what.

577
00:54:06,999 --> 00:54:24,319
So in number two, on 39, about the very last line of the page, I recognize Socrates and Plato as symptoms of decay as agents of the dissolution of Greece, as pseudo-Greeks, as anti-Greek.

578
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:30,479
Well, you get confused unless you realize he means anti-Homeric Greeks, that they've lost it.

579
00:54:30,479 --> 00:54:37,440
They've lost this wonderful sort of mastery and skill that the Homeric Greek had.

580
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,599
You can see on 41 that those are the real Greeks.

581
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:55,600
At the bottom of section 4, he says, I seek to understand out of what idiosyncrasy that Socratic question, equation, reason equal virtue, equal happiness, derives.

582
00:54:55,600 --> 00:55:03,439
That bizarrest of equations, and one which has a particular, has in particular all the instincts of the older Hellens.

583
00:55:03,439 --> 00:55:06,640
There you see it, against it.

584
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,720
That's the Homeric ones.

585
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:21,039
And these later Greeks used reason to control their instincts, and that was a fatal law.

586
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:24,400
On 43, he's talking about all that.

587
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,520
Read that.

588
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,039
I can read that.

589
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,079
Yeah, okay.

590
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:39,520
And all that he calls decadence on the next page, on 44, the end of 11.

591
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:44,159
To have to combat one's instincts, that's a formula for decadence.

592
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,319
As long as life is ascending, happiness and instinct are one.

593
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:49,600
Now you can see why.

594
00:55:49,600 --> 00:56:03,360
I mean, if you could just spontaneously, skillfully, and generally successfully go through life as if you were a sort of champion, a master of whatever, that would make you, that would keep you happy.

595
00:56:03,999 --> 00:56:05,879
And reason is not part of that.

596
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,279
Reason would undermine that.

597
00:56:08,919 --> 00:56:19,240
Now, you might, and that means that philosophers, he now generalizes, because those are the first philosophers, and they started this thing about reason.

598
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:22,919
And that means that philosophers are decadent.

599
00:56:22,919 --> 00:56:27,559
On 119, about 50 lines down.

600
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:30,599
But the philosophers are the decadence of Hellenism.

601
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,680
See, there, that's the Athenians.

602
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:39,560
The counter movement against the old, the noble taste, that is, spontaneously doing the noble thing.

603
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:54,520
Against the agonal instinct, that means the instinct for confrontation and combat of a good sort in games, in the Olympic Games, for instance, or in the kind of in their wars.

604
00:56:54,919 --> 00:56:57,319
Agonal instinct against the polis.

605
00:56:57,319 --> 00:57:01,000
That's against the city when it worked.

606
00:57:00,999 --> 00:57:06,279
See, Athens, well, it worked for a while, and then everybody did have good instinct.

607
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:11,639
For those who know any history, under Pericles, then it was a perfect, perfect democracy.

608
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:15,480
They all voted and they all agreed, and everything went very well.

609
00:57:15,479 --> 00:57:17,240
But they've lost it.

610
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:25,720
So, and they've lost the sense of the unity of the city, of the polis, against the value of the race, against the authority of tradition.

611
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:35,640
You've got to have a tradition, of course, if you're going to be able to learn to do things the right way, because what the right way is, is simply what's good according to the tradition.

612
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:46,119
And if you start questioning the tradition, the way Socrates and Plato did, saying, well, that's just, you know, what people say and what people think, we don't want that.

613
00:57:47,399 --> 00:57:51,120
We don't want to know what's good, to put it in contemporary terms.

614
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,120
We want a theory of what's right.

615
00:57:53,439 --> 00:57:59,200
We want a theory of justice, never mind what you just happen to intuitive justice.

616
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:04,159
That's what leads them wrong, makes them wrong.

617
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,959
So it's the against all that.

618
00:58:06,959 --> 00:58:10,640
The Socratic virtues were preached because the Greeks had lost them.

619
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,760
Excitable, timid, fickle, comedians, everyone.

620
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,120
They had more than enough reason to let morality be preached to them.

621
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,279
Not that it would have done any good.

622
00:58:19,279 --> 00:58:22,959
The big words and fine attitudes are suitable to decadence.

623
00:58:22,959 --> 00:58:30,719
This is just an outrageous thing in the face of the 2,000 years of Socrates' worship.

624
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,239
This is Nietzsche taking on everything.

625
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,679
Let's see now.

626
00:58:35,999 --> 00:58:37,279
Oh, yeah, I wrote here.

627
00:58:37,279 --> 00:58:40,559
And why should we believe his view about what was going on in Greece?

628
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,079
Well, partly it doesn't matter.

629
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,840
He's making up his story.

630
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:46,799
They're against the other interpretation.

631
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:51,840
But at least you should realize that he was an authority on Greek culture.

632
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:59,760
He was a superstar of Greek philology, which means knowing the Greek language and everything written in the Greek language.

633
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:05,519
You can get everything written in Athenian Greek on one CD, I read somewhere.

634
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,359
And that's quite surprising.

635
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,360
Nietzsche knew it all.

636
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:16,559
And he was so smart that he got tenure at the age of 24 at the University of Basel.

637
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,479
He was an absolute superstar.

638
00:59:18,479 --> 00:59:22,160
Then he just quit all that and went out and wrote these books.

639
00:59:22,479 --> 00:59:24,960
So now, let me see where we are.

640
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:43,000
Okay, now back for a minute to Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky and how they deal with it.

641
00:59:42,999 --> 00:59:52,279
Kierkegaard is still, remember I said, the last one who sees that mediation is a stage that it's a good thing to go through.

642
00:59:52,279 --> 01:00:02,920
Because he understands that it's a good thing to question the rationality of your superstitions and your phobias and your fanaticisms and your desires.

643
01:00:02,919 --> 01:00:13,959
And that it's, and if you use philosophy that way, it's a means to get rid of lower immediacy and make a place for higher immediacy.

644
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,559
That's Kierkegaard.

645
01:00:15,879 --> 01:00:17,799
And that's interesting.

646
01:00:17,799 --> 01:00:23,240
And Kierkegaard would say, but now why is Kierkegaard then not like a philosopher?

647
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,159
Well, why?

648
01:00:25,479 --> 01:00:26,679
Does anybody know?

649
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:33,480
I mean, he likes mediation, but it's a means, not an end.

650
01:00:33,479 --> 01:00:40,040
It's a means of getting rid of lower immediacy, thereby a means to sort of clear a space for higher immediacy.

651
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:43,720
But it's not something that you should build your life around.

652
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:48,040
And that's what philosophers do, according to Kierkegaard and Nietzsche.

653
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:54,839
And Dostoevsky, they're interested in people who just not, they're not upset with people who study philosophy.

654
01:00:54,839 --> 01:01:12,120
They're people who they're people who live, like Plato and Socrates said philosophers should live, namely detached, theoretical, denying their bodies, denying any involvement with local concerns and so forth.

655
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:21,680
So, but Kierkegaard is the last of the existentialists that has any place of value for rationality and reflection and philosophy.

656
01:01:20,439 --> 01:01:26,080
Because for Dostoevsky and Nietzsche, philosophy isn't even a meme.

657
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:28,799
Now, we haven't talked about Dostoevsky.

658
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:41,279
Dostoevsky doesn't directly attack Socrates, but he does certainly attack Western, detached, critical rationality.

659
01:01:41,279 --> 01:01:43,360
And how does he attack it?

660
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:47,440
Well, who's the philosopher in the Brothers Karamatsky?

661
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,559
Who went to the university and studied natural philosophy?

662
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:52,960
Yvonne.

663
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:53,679
And yes.

664
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,680
And who's the detached one?

665
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,640
And the rational one, the theoretical one.

666
01:01:58,959 --> 01:02:00,400
Well, Yvonne.

667
01:02:00,399 --> 01:02:04,160
He's the incarnation of, well, that word is better not.

668
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:09,440
He's the paradigm case of a philosophy-minded person.

669
01:02:09,439 --> 01:02:11,440
And what becomes of Yvonne?

670
01:02:11,439 --> 01:02:23,200
Well, he's dangerous and sick and suffering, and there's nothing good you can say about it, but he's decadent in the Nietzschean decade.

671
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,599
He had one moment in which he did something impulsive.

672
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,040
He picked up the peasant.

673
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:34,240
And if he had gone on with something impulsive and confessed to the police, who knows what would have happened.

674
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,600
But he managed to.

675
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:43,760
There's this joke: if you have this intense desire to do something, you should lie down till it goes away.

676
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:52,239
Well, that's how Yvonne, when Yvonne has an impulsive, intense desire to do something, his attitude is, well, let's wait till tomorrow, it'll go away.

677
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,680
That's what happened.

678
01:02:53,999 --> 01:03:08,839
So Yvonne, who was from the beginning a detached spectator, an eyewitness, denies his involvement in the world, denies his involvement in life, and that makes him sick and dangerous.

679
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:23,479
And now we get back, yeah, we just have time, to the way Socrates is decadent and how that's related to the way Yvonne is decadent.

680
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,560
I think I've got half of it done already.

681
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,399
Yes, so there was the decadence.

682
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:30,279
I'm just making sure catching up with myself with that.

683
01:03:35,879 --> 01:03:42,760
Well, we've got to add something from page 39 because it's people, now we're switching to something specific.

684
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:46,999
How do philosophers and Yvonne relate to life?

685
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:55,399
And at the top of 39, Nietzsche says, in every age, the wisest have passed the identical judgment on life.

686
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,600
It's worthless.

687
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,680
He's being ironic about wises.

688
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:03,399
He means the people who we take to be wisest, like Plato and Socrates.

689
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:12,600
Everywhere and always, their mouths have uttered the same sound, a sound full of doubt, full of melancholy, full of weariness with life, full of opposition to life.

690
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:17,799
Even Socrates said as he died, to die that means to be a long time sick.

691
01:04:17,799 --> 01:04:19,720
That is, his whole life was sick.

692
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:21,879
And now that he's dying, he's getting well.

693
01:04:21,879 --> 01:04:26,199
He said, I owe a cock to the savior, Aescalabius.

694
01:04:26,199 --> 01:04:42,279
That means that if you read the footnote, that you give a cock, a rooster, to your doctor as paying him off when you're recovering from an illness.

695
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,680
So, Socrates is recovering from an illness.

696
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:45,959
What illness?

697
01:04:45,959 --> 01:04:47,479
Being alive.

698
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:54,879
And now that he's dying, he considers this being cured of being alive, and he says he's going to give the doctor a reward.

699
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:59,359
So Nietzsche says, even Socrates has had enough of it.

700
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,440
Always, what that proves?

701
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,680
What's the point?

702
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:10,159
Well, skipping a little, here at any rate, there's something sick.

703
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:11,680
That's our retort.

704
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:14,720
One ought to take a closer look at them, these wisest.

705
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:18,079
Were all of them perhaps no longer steady on their legs?

706
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,079
Belated, tottery, decadence?

707
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:24,799
Does wisdom perhaps appear on earth as a raven which is inspired by the smell of tarian?

708
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:28,720
Nietzsche just goes on and on saying marvelous things like that.

709
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:35,600
And now we get to where he converges with Yvonne on 40.

710
01:05:38,159 --> 01:05:40,319
It's about the value of life.

711
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,720
Remember what Yvonne is up to.

712
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:49,039
He thinks that life isn't valuable, the world isn't valuable, that he's going to kill himself when he gets to be 30.

713
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:56,879
He'll kill himself sooner, but he can't quite get over the traction of the sticky green leaves on the one hand and cater katarina on the other.

714
01:05:56,879 --> 01:06:00,479
But as soon as he does, he's going to get out of this life.

715
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:09,760
And so now we've got to connect this with this issue about the value of life on page 40, about 15 lines down.

716
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:16,879
Judgments, value judgments concerning life, for or against, can, in the last retort, never be true.

717
01:06:16,879 --> 01:06:18,079
This is Nietzsche's view.

718
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:20,640
They possess value only as symptoms.

719
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,600
They come into consideration only as symptoms.

720
01:06:23,919 --> 01:06:25,600
As judgments, they're stupidities.

721
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:28,239
And their symptoms, what, of sickness, decadence.

722
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:34,239
One must reach out and try to grasp this astonishing finesse that the value of life cannot be estimated.

723
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:37,479
Not by a living man because he's a party to the dispute.

724
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:41,720
That means, remember, that what I, Yvonne, didn't realize that he's just alive already.

725
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:48,919
He can't just join it or leave it the way you join or leave a fraternity, a sorority, or whatever.

726
01:06:48,919 --> 01:06:51,399
So it's a party to it.

727
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:54,760
Indeed, its object, and not the judge of it.

728
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:02,839
Dead people can't judge life because they're dead, and living people can't judge life because they're too close to it.

729
01:07:02,839 --> 01:07:08,760
For a philosopher to see a problem in the value of life, thus even constitutes an objection to him.

730
01:07:08,999 --> 01:07:10,600
Well, that's exactly Yvonne.

731
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:11,959
He's a philosopher.

732
01:07:11,959 --> 01:07:15,319
He's asking about the value of life, and it's an objection.

733
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:24,439
He's got a position, Nietzsche's saying, that nobody can have, namely, as if he was standing outside of life, judging it, weighing it.

734
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:27,959
He's making exactly the same objection that Dostoevsky made.

735
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:33,319
It constitutes an objection, a question mark as to his wisdom, a piece of unwisdom.

736
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:33,799
What?

737
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:40,439
And these wise men, they have not only been decadent, they are not even wise, and so forth.

738
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:47,799
Okay, so, and now, just a quick reference to the brothers.

739
01:07:48,119 --> 01:07:51,879
On page 224, you don't have it with you because I didn't tell you to bring it.

740
01:07:51,879 --> 01:07:53,640
You can look on 224.

741
01:07:53,640 --> 01:08:00,039
They have a brief discussion, Alyasha and Yvonne, about the value of life.

742
01:08:00,039 --> 01:08:07,959
On page 224, Yvonne is saying that he loves the blue sky and the sticky leaves and sins.

743
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:09,159
And do you understand?

744
01:08:09,159 --> 01:08:12,760
He says to Alyasha, I understand, Yvonne.

745
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:15,319
One loves with one's inside, with one's stomach.

746
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:16,760
You said it so well.

747
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,559
I am awfully glad you have such a longing for life.

748
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:22,959
I think everyone should love life above everything in the world.

749
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:26,640
And then Yvonne backs off and says, Love life more than the meaning of it.

750
01:08:26,959 --> 01:08:29,439
See, that's the wrong move.

751
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:33,760
So step outside now and ask whether you should love it, depending on what it means.

752
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:38,560
Because Alyasha answers, certainly, love it regardless of logic, as you say.

753
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,559
It must be regardless of logic.

754
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,039
It's only then one can understand the meaning of it.

755
01:08:43,039 --> 01:08:45,439
I thought so for a long time.

756
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,839
And so it's the same point.

757
01:08:48,480 --> 01:09:00,720
Alyasha is saying to Yvonne, you can't step outside and ask about the meaning of life and decide whether to be judging it, whether it's good or bad, whether you should join it or not.

758
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:11,519
You're in it, and if this is something that Nietzsche thinks too, if you get really involved in it, you will be joyful and appreciate it.

759
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:18,239
But if you stop and withdraw and ask yourself whether you should become involved in it, you're lost.

760
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,640
They both agree on that.

761
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,799
Now I just got time to finish.

762
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:27,999
So the philosopher is weak and decadent.

763
01:09:27,999 --> 01:09:32,959
Otherwise, he wouldn't even try to step outside of life and become detached and judge it.

764
01:09:32,959 --> 01:09:35,199
That's what Nietzsche says on 55.

765
01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:38,399
And the way he says it is very interesting.

766
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:41,119
Look at this on 55.

767
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:44,959
Where?

768
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:46,799
55.

769
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:49,199
No, I'm not on 55.

770
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:49,919
Here we are.

771
01:09:49,919 --> 01:09:55,039
Okay, and then in number five, on 55, it's about five lines down.

772
01:09:55,039 --> 01:10:00,640
For a condemnation of life by the living is, after all, no more than a symptom of a certain kind of life.

773
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:05,119
The question whether the condemnation is just or unjust has not been raised at all.

774
01:10:05,119 --> 01:10:08,680
One would have to be situated outside life.

775
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:11,079
So that's the same point again.

776
01:10:12,039 --> 01:10:14,520
Now I want the punchline at the top of five.

777
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:27,959
If one has grasped the blasphemousness of such a rebellion against life as has in Christian morality become virtually sacrosanct, one has fortunately therewith grasped something else as well.

778
01:10:27,959 --> 01:10:32,839
The uselessness, illusoriness, absurdity, falsity of such a rebellion.

779
01:10:32,839 --> 01:10:37,079
Remember what Yvonne's chapter is called, where he gives back the world?

780
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,159
Called rebellion.

781
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:48,600
And this is the kind of little hint where you wonder whether this whole diatribe isn't about Yvonne, and maybe Dostoevsky has read it.

782
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:53,399
At least his name for stepping outside of life and rejecting it is rebellion.

783
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:55,239
So is Dostoevsky's.

784
01:10:56,199 --> 01:11:00,999
And they both agree that if you step outside of life, it only shows that you're sick.

785
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,319
No, I think I don't need to read that.

786
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:10,999
I think I'm just about done.

787
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:15,879
Yeah, that's it.

788
01:11:15,879 --> 01:11:16,359
Okay.

789
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:21,640
Next time, we're going to start with talking about the gay science.

790
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:25,799
So read the passages in the gay science that I tell you about.
