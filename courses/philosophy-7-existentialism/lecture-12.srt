1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
First, I want to finish the discussion of despair.

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:11,039
Remember, I left you with this kind of cliffhanger to figure out why you were all in despair, or almost all, anyway.

3
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:21,359
Anyone who doesn't hasn't, if you haven't been in despair and saved, pulled out of it by a defining commitment, you're in despair.

4
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:33,679
And I might add, because somebody just asked me a question right before I started talking, which showed some not quite understanding, because you could still be in despair, even if you had a defining commitment.

5
00:00:34,319 --> 00:00:35,520
You ought to know that.

6
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:44,639
Who we know from the course has a defining commitment and is in despair anyway.

7
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,440
Good?

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,280
Kierkegaard.

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,039
Well, who knows?

10
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,040
I mean, that's too hard to say, yeah.

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,480
A night of resignation, right.

12
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,640
And I was thinking of the French woman.

13
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:03,279
She's surely in despair.

14
00:01:03,279 --> 00:01:05,679
She gives this moan of utter sadness.

15
00:01:05,679 --> 00:01:07,520
That's not just ordinary sadness.

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,199
We'll come back to that in a minute.

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,479
And she's in despair.

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:17,839
The only people who aren't in despair are people who were in despair, have a defining commitment, and have faith.

19
00:01:17,839 --> 00:01:24,719
That is, don't go into resignation, but stay in the defining commitment.

20
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:34,399
Now, and while I'm at it, why don't I get explain something else, which I was going to explain later, because it seems silly to go back and repeat it.

21
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:38,080
That we have to distinguish despair from anguish.

22
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,799
Somebody asked me about that after class.

23
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,159
That's important.

24
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,479
They are really almost opposites.

25
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:51,599
Despair is the experience we talked about last time: that you can't relate the factors.

26
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,879
You can't get them together.

27
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,559
They're a contradiction.

28
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:56,679
And you got on your own.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,639
Nobody can get them together.

30
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,920
And therefore, another way to put it, that's why everybody's in despair.

31
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,200
I'll come back to that.

32
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,839
Let's get anguish taken care of.

33
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:11,719
Anguish is the positive feeling that the night of faith has.

34
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:27,319
When the knight of faith has a defining commitment, doesn't flee from it and make it safe in resignation, but holds on to it, seeing the sword over the head of the beloved and getting more and more involved as if it's the surest thing of all.

35
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,520
That's anguish.

36
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,360
Remember, anguish is the very criterion of a knight of faith.

37
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:55,479
The knight of faith also, suspending the ethical, which every knight of faith does, because once you've got a defining commitment, you've got a higher authority in your life than the ethical, which may not be calling you right now to do something that you wish you never would have to do and couldn't stand yourself after you did it, but might at any time call you to do something like that.

38
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:02,840
And so the person who has a defining commitment is also in anguish of the possible teleological.

39
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:09,480
So there's, I guess, put it this way: there's an anguish over the possible sword falling, which is over the head of the beloved.

40
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,399
That's the vulnerability.

41
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:17,880
And there's the anguish of the possible call to go against the ethical at any time might come.

42
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,520
And that's the other, that's the anguish of problems one and two.

43
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:24,759
I think that's all I want to say about that.

44
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,560
So, and then the anguish, well, I need to finish.

45
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,159
Bliss is obviously a very, very miserable feeling.

46
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:37,959
Anguish is a tension which you're in, but it goes with bliss.

47
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:40,239
It's not an awful feeling.

48
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,720
It's just a feeling that, boy, things are weird.

49
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:49,360
There are things I'm doing that I can't understand how I'm doing them or why I'm doing them, but I know I have to do them feeling.

50
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,039
And that's, you couldn't have bliss without that.

51
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,120
Okay.

52
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,159
So just, and everyone who's got an unconditional commitment and is a knight of faith is in anguish.

53
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:11,040
And everyone who doesn't have an unconditional commitment or is an unconditional, has one, but doesn't have faith, is in despair.

54
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,159
That's, get that all cleared up.

55
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:22,800
But now we're ready to talk about the issue which is where we left off.

56
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:25,599
I just want to make sure now that that is where we are.

57
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,800
Yeah, okay.

58
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:34,239
Now, we were just saying, why should we believe we're all in despair?

59
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,919
Why not say, look, not me, I'm getting the most out of my possibilities.

60
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:38,959
I'm happy.

61
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,200
I don't feel anguished, but I don't need to.

62
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,080
And I don't feel despair because everything is going extremely well.

63
00:04:46,080 --> 00:05:00,000
Well, the answer to that is on your handout, and it's very sort of brilliant and ingenious, and I think probably convincing.

64
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,440
So let's read it.

65
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,200
This is on the same side of the handout as the chart.

66
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:12,399
And I'm quoting Kierkegaard from the other translation just because I already had it on the chart.

67
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,200
I didn't want to do the page all over again.

68
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:17,200
There's no important difference.

69
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:31,399
So the common view, I'm going to read it, overlooks the fact that when compared with illness, despair differs dialectically from what one usually calls sickness because it's sickness of the spirit.

70
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:35,640
And this dialectical, I mean, dialectic is this funny word.

71
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,999
I don't really know how to explain what he means when he slings it around.

72
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,200
He talks about the dialectic of eternity in a minute.

73
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:45,640
Does anybody know why he keeps saying dialectical?

74
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,359
I don't either.

75
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,959
I bet it's something Hegelian.

76
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:50,120
It makes absolutely no difference.

77
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,680
You could just cross it out every time you come across it.

78
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,279
I think that's a good idea.

79
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,959
Then it makes more sense.

80
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:02,039
And this aspect, properly understood, brings further thousands under the category of despair.

81
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:17,560
If at any time a physician is convinced that so-and-so is in good health, and then later that person becomes ill, then the physician may well be right about this person's having been well at the time, but now sick.

82
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:20,039
Despair isn't like that.

83
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:25,239
Once despair appears, what is apparent is that the person was in despair.

84
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:31,560
In fact, it's never possible at any time to decide anything about a person who's not saved through having been in despair.

85
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,320
That's what we've been talking about.

86
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:40,359
For when whatever causes a person to despair occurs, it is immediately evident that he's been in despair his whole life.

87
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,200
That's the interesting move.

88
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:48,919
When someone gets a fever, on the other hand, it cannot possibly be said that now it is evident that he's had fever all his life.

89
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:51,560
That despair is a characteristic of the spirit.

90
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:56,599
It's related to the eternal, and there's something of the eternal in it.

91
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,600
I just got rid of dialectic.

92
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:03,080
Okay, now, what goes on here?

93
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:06,200
Does my voice sound too loud to you or just to me?

94
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,959
It sounds okay to you.

95
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,719
Okay, then I won't mess with it.

96
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,440
So, now what's going on there?

97
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:21,679
Well, you've got to understand more the phenomenology, the description of the feeling of despair.

98
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:24,719
And then you'll understand what he's saying.

99
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,239
What is it to say that despair has got eternity in it?

100
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,320
Well, he says it means that when you're in despair, you realize you always were and always will be.

101
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,360
But what is that?

102
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:52,159
Well, now, I think to figure that out, you have to take a sort of running start and not just use despair in a kind of sloppy way, but realize it has a very technical meaning for Kierkegaard, and probably really it does.

103
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:55,200
Despair is a very, very special mood.

104
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,440
And you want to distinguish it from, say, being sad.

105
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:11,600
If you're sad, melancholy, as people used to say, then you know that it's temporary, that you'll get over it, that you get sad before, and after that, you're happy again.

106
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:32,640
Now, it could be worse if something awful happens to you and you're so miserable that you don't think that the rest of your life would ever be the same and you could ever be happy again because this has made it impossible for you to be happy ever again, then you're really miserable.

107
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,720
I don't know what the word for that is.

108
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,079
That's really bad.

109
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:38,240
That's about as bad as it can get.

110
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,920
Short of despair.

111
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,080
That's not despair.

112
00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:44,960
Now, the tricky thing is to understand that.

113
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:51,360
Despair is the experience that it's always been impossible for things to work out for you.

114
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,760
They didn't just start being bad.

115
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,960
They were just playing bad all along.

116
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,080
Your way of relating to the factors is bad.

117
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,120
It won't work.

118
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,640
It can't give you a meaningful life.

119
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:11,880
So when you run into despair, you get an experience that your whole life that well your life isn't working now.

120
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,159
You get that experience.

121
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:13,960
That's too bad.

122
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,000
That's sad.

123
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,360
Maybe that's miserable.

124
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:25,960
But you get the other, the more experience, and moreover, the kind of life you got could never work, never make you happy, never give you a fulfillment.

125
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:41,240
Now we're lucky we have the French woman, because in the movie, when she makes this moan of utter sadness when she's looking in her mirror in the bathroom in the hotel at the end of the movie, what does she understand?

126
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,960
Does she just understand that, oh boy, it's not going to work out with the Japanese guy, isn't that too bad?

127
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,960
And I have to go home to my husband and keep what's really important all about me secret.

128
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,240
Isn't that too bad?

129
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,840
At least I've saved the German.

130
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,960
Isn't that great?

131
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,799
Is that what she's got?

132
00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:04,680
A moan of utter sadness, the utter in there part, is it's sadness for all the past and sadness for all the future.

133
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:11,000
She's realized that she's in a kind of trap, that her life is set up so it can't work.

134
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:19,560
If she gives up the German, she makes her life meaningless and loses her identity and regresses to the lower nature and lower immediacy.

135
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:34,280
If she holds on to the German the way she understands memory, she has the German always in front of her and she can't relate to anybody else, even somebody as utterly understanding and sexy and good-looking and lovable as the Japanese man.

136
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,960
And that's bad news.

137
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:42,560
And so, in other words, she sees her life is literally totally hopeless.

138
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:44,560
And that's despair.

139
00:10:44,880 --> 00:11:05,120
And now it follows, of course, from what I've just said, that if despair is really like that, that your life isn't working, your way of living can't make you happy and meaningful, give you a meaningful life, then what is your attitude toward your past when you were happy and everything seemed to be going well?

140
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:11,360
What would have to be your attitude towards your past once you get this experience?

141
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,840
This is the eternity in it.

142
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,439
You weren't really happy, exactly.

143
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:19,039
It must have been an illusion.

144
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:28,799
If you've got an experience which says, right on the face of it, your life isn't working and it can never work, it also says, and it has never worked.

145
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:31,040
You can't have one without the other.

146
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:42,000
And now, the pieces are all in place to see what it means to say that you are all, or almost all, in despair right now.

147
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,720
And how it's related to discovering that you've got a disease right now.

148
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,080
Well, if you discover you've got a disease right now, you don't have to discover that you had it all along.

149
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,919
But if you get into despair, what do you discover?

150
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,919
And that's the future part.

151
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,440
What about the past?

152
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,360
That's right.

153
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,680
Your life was hopeless all along.

154
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:18,240
You were in despair all along.

155
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,120
You just repressed it, covered it up, distracted yourself, or something like that.

156
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:26,680
But and now what does that tell you about you right now?

157
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,280
It's all a very brilliant and ingenious argument.

158
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:36,360
You i everybody sitting here right now can at any moment in their life experience despair.

159
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,800
And then what will they understand about the themselves sitting here right now?

160
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,919
It better be clear.

161
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:48,680
I'm saying it in simple words of one syllable.

162
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:53,319
What will you know about your life right now if you get into despair ten years from now?

163
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:55,880
That you were in despair right now.

164
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,880
You were just covering it up.

165
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,240
You were under the illusion you were happy and your life was working.

166
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:10,840
It couldn't be because ten years from now you're going to discover your life never worked and never could and never will given the way you've set your life up.

167
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:17,240
Now there are several sort of, once you see that, there's sort of footnotes to say it may never happen to you.

168
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,480
You may be lucky enough to get through life without ever hitting despair.

169
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:30,120
Just like you may be lucky enough to get through life with your defining commitment, always safe, even though it's vulnerable, the sword will never fall.

170
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:38,120
But the very fact that you could at any moment experience despair is enough to show that you're in despair right now.

171
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:47,159
Because if you could at any moment experience it, then you could always, then you will always be able retroactively to experience it.

172
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:52,839
And nothing guarantees that you aren't going to experience it some moment in the future, except what?

173
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:57,880
You can talk and say, what could guarantee you that you wouldn't experience despair in the future?

174
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,840
That it wasn't just a lucky fluke if you get my life without experiencing it.

175
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:14,480
Yeah, that you're a knight of faith and you have your defining commitment and you've been in despair because everybody is in despair before they get the defining commitment and before they get to be a knight of faith.

176
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:28,240
And so the only possible, so nothing except that could guarantee that at some future moment you may retroactively realize that you're in despair right now.

177
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,399
And that's what he wants to convince you of.

178
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:47,040
And it does seem, I think, right to follow if you believe that despair is this kind of special, retroactive and proactive that is eternal for all time, for your life, forever in your life, experience.

179
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:53,039
And I think people do have that experience, and seeing the Japanese lady having it is a pretty clear case of it.

180
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:54,399
Now, somebody wanted to say something.

181
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,920
You still want to say something?

182
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:24,399
Yeah, but once you have the experience, you don't just think maybe I was always in despair.

183
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,439
By the nature of it, you must have been in despair right now.

184
00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:28,960
It's stronger than that.

185
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,799
Because, I mean, it's this picture.

186
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,679
You sort of see that this is the same as the defining commitment eternity, only upside down.

187
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:48,880
I mean, the defining commitment eternity was you get to an X, an instant, in which your whole past is empty and your whole future is settled in terms of the person or cause that you're involved with.

188
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:59,399
Well, if this X was despair, you'd get to the understanding that your whole past didn't work and you were miserable, and no matter how far the future goes into the future, you will always be miserable.

189
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:07,480
And once you see that, it follows that no matter how good you feel now, it must have been an illusion.

190
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:14,520
I mean, this isn't just a prediction or a guess, it follows from the nature of despair, according to him.

191
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:19,000
And it sounds very plausible and interesting.

192
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,760
You put it to see it that way.

193
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,799
There was one other thing I was thinking to say that might help.

194
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:25,000
Just a second.

195
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,480
Oh, well, I could give you another example from Kierkegaard that might help.

196
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,880
You need to have some kind of feel for this.

197
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:43,080
I mean, maybe you'll know somebody like this, or if you don't, you might be able to make up somebody else who has some other version of this.

198
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:51,559
I mean, Kierkegaard talks about a kind of person who feels that they were dealt with badly in their childhood, in whatever way.

199
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:57,000
Their sibling made life miserable for them or some other such thing.

200
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:06,919
And they feel that they won't accept the world or themselves unless that gets fixed and made right.

201
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,159
They want the past to be changed.

202
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,599
But they, of course, that's a bad idea because they can't change it.

203
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:16,119
What they could change is the future, and they could get over it.

204
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,880
But they don't want to do that.

205
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,960
They don't want to say, well, it was all right.

206
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,000
I got over it.

207
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:22,599
It's too outrageous.

208
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,520
It's like losing their identity.

209
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,760
Their identity has been to be miserable.

210
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,720
And so they're stuck being miserable.

211
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:36,439
They can't change what they want to change, and they don't want to change what they can change, Kierkegigran says.

212
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,439
I'm sure there are people in therapy like that.

213
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:44,000
And that's just a none more sort of simple example.

214
00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:52,959
And that person might go through stages in which sort of temporarily they're very happy, I don't know, playing their computer games or surfing or whatever.

215
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:59,199
But behind it all is this sense that their life is a total disaster.

216
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,839
Any question about that?

217
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,959
Okay, then let me see where we are.

218
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:20,720
I think that's something more to say about this eternal, but I hope we risk.

219
00:18:20,879 --> 00:18:24,799
Somebody asks a question, they'll probably point to me, point me to where I'm missing something.

220
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:25,599
Yeah.

221
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,000
Ah, that's a wonderful question.

222
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,799
I don't know.

223
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,760
That is very interesting.

224
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,359
Let me think about that.

225
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:49,279
I think she, well, no, I have to think more.

226
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,599
Yes.

227
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:57,039
Oh, absolutely.

228
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:09,119
See, in her case, it looks like her despair of utter sadness starts at the moment she takes up resignation as the way to deal with the death of the German.

229
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,119
And before that, it looks like what?

230
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:27,559
We might want to say she was blissfully happy, but the trouble with that is we, it certainly won't, Kierkegaard won't like that, because he says you can't be blissfully happy until you've been in despair and been cured of it.

231
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:32,279
She hasn't got the imagination to think of what would happen if she lost the germ.

232
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:46,599
But that lots of people like that, Kierkegaard says, that don't have it the only way only get this problem of the loss of the other person when it becomes a dire necessity, as he puts it, the other person's just already dead.

233
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:50,200
So what was her state of mind before?

234
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,159
No?

235
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:58,279
I think that's wonderful to have something to think about like that.

236
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:58,600
Yeah.

237
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,679
I don't know, but let's tell I'm not gonna unless that's gonna help me understand her.

238
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:30,199
I mean, is that that the despair oughtn't to be different once she has understood that she's well the I think probably?

239
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,880
I say still on.

240
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:41,240
I think what you have to do is try to realize that Kierkegaard didn't need the strong claim he was making.

241
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,160
And then we have to sort of fix him up.

242
00:20:43,159 --> 00:21:05,399
I mean nothing falls apart in his position if we understand that by the time she's got herself into this state of resignation, she's in despair, and she understands that her whole life from there on, from the moment the German was killed on, has been hopeless.

243
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,480
And she and but that's easy.

244
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,520
What and what does she understand about the life before?

245
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,240
That it was terrific, that she was happy.

246
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,160
I'm really puzzled.

247
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,639
Yeah.

248
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,520
That's what Kierkegaard would say, but why should we think so?

249
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,240
Here she got a defining commitment.

250
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:36,320
Okay, good.

251
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:37,279
I see your point.

252
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:43,279
She's saying, well, but wouldn't she realize that even when she was happy, seemingly happy with the German, that was illusory.

253
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:45,119
She was in despair and she didn't know it.

254
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,480
Well, that's certainly, that's what Kierkegaard claims.

255
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,319
That's what we'd like to show.

256
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,920
But you can't just assert it.

257
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:58,480
So what would it look like for her to be in despair while she was happy with the German?

258
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,000
That's half the question.

259
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,760
And how does it look to her now?

260
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,039
Does she now think that her time with the German was miserable?

261
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,480
I don't think so.

262
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,879
So it isn't as if she now she's in despair.

263
00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:15,760
She ought to discover that she'd always been in despair.

264
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,760
I'm just groping to understand this.

265
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,720
Let's see now.

266
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:31,440
She's always been in despair in a very remote way, which I could explain, but I don't, I will, but I'm not convinced it's strong enough.

267
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:48,960
I mean, she obviously was related to the German in a way that put her sort of to the vulnerability of this resignation, which is a kind of despair.

268
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:58,199
She certainly wasn't related to him in the right night of faith way, where she saw the sword over the head of the beloved and loved as if it was the surest thing of all.

269
00:22:55,359 --> 00:23:01,559
She just didn't think about the fact that the German might die.

270
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,679
All she thought about is she go to Bavaria with him.

271
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:18,839
Now, that means that she was sort of potentially in despair, exposed to the possibility of despair, because she had this defining commitment and she had the wrong way of dealing with it.

272
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:27,240
But that's hardly strong enough to say that she was, that her life wasn't working there.

273
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:35,879
Her life was set up in a way that in the end it wasn't going to work for her because she didn't have faith.

274
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,440
But it's hard for me to get any content to that.

275
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,960
I mean, how did it feel at the point that she was with the German?

276
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:55,079
Surely she had, you have to say if you're Kierkegaard, well, her sense that it wasn't working was way covered up by how much fun she was having with the German, but that just doesn't feel right for me.

277
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,000
I'm stumped.

278
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,919
Nobody had any help.

279
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,400
Yeah.

280
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,119
How about they?

281
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,480
That was sort of fun.

282
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,120
When you see that in the movie, she's running there on her bicycle, all happy and excited.

283
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,639
And it's just part of the...

284
00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:19,640
I mean, they didn't feel that it was an evil thing they were doing, and so they had to hide it.

285
00:24:19,639 --> 00:24:24,439
They felt it was a good thing, but the time was evil, and so they had to hide it.

286
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,680
I'm just going to, I just don't know why.

287
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:47,119
I mean my tend my temptation is to go out on a limb and say that there's a there's a place for some kind of situation where somebody hasn't yet realized that their way of life won't work.

288
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,720
They haven't realized it unconsciously and covered it up.

289
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,599
They just haven't realized it at all.

290
00:24:53,599 --> 00:25:08,240
And you can call that despair if you want to, but it's now got a funny thing because it seems so remote from the sense that things aren't working and will never work, which is the real feeling of I'm getting nowhere.

291
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:08,640
Yeah.

292
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:14,959
Yes.

293
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,959
Yeah, that's the best you can do, I think.

294
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,760
What that feels like, I don't really know.

295
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:39,359
It isn't, it somehow feels odd to say that I was under an illusion covering this up because it never has seemed would have seemed to have occurred to her.

296
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:55,199
And therefore to say she was in despair is a very sort of weak thing to say about her, namely that she was living in a way that once he died, her life was ruined.

297
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:00,320
And therefore she was sort of vulnerable to despair all along.

298
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:01,520
That's what you're really saying.

299
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,359
And that's enough, that is despair, to be vulnerable to despair.

300
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:15,919
Then she should retroactively realize that not only her life hasn't worked since the German died, but her life wasn't even working while the German was around.

301
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:20,279
And I don't get any sense that she did realize that, or that she should realize that.

302
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,839
Help.

303
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:47,480
Good.

304
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,880
Well, then we would have to figure out what her kind was.

305
00:26:49,879 --> 00:26:56,199
That's why I gave you the example of the person who doesn't want to live in the future because they want to change the past.

306
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:59,400
That was supposed to illustrate something which I didn't make clear.

307
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:11,399
I mean, everybody's got some way of taking a stand on the factors which denies the contradiction or fails to resolve the contradiction.

308
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,559
But there has to be some specific way.

309
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:24,520
I mean, it's true that the factors are such that there is no right way to relate to them by yourself that would get them together.

310
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,400
Satisfy one side or the other.

311
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,520
That's right.

312
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:45,720
And that I just trying to get the feel for what it's like to feel that the factors couldn't be gotten together in your particular life, in your particular style of taking a stand on them, and that you never had them together and you couldn't possibly get them together.

313
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,039
And even looking back on it, you can see that you were failing to get them together.

314
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:53,720
That's what I concretely don't get.

315
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,240
Okay, some people, everybody else, I'm glad everybody's trying to help.

316
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,799
This is amazing to find a new puzzle.

317
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:02,839
Every year there's got to be some new puzzle, yeah.

318
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,000
She realizes that it has been like the highest level of his misery.

319
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,720
He's never used it while he's alive, like he's never had a finding commitment.

320
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:28,480
But no, I don't think that's true to the, you know, it looks to me like she did have a defining commitment to him while he was living.

321
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:39,679
Otherwise, why would she go into this total grief and this turning him into this ideal thing which she had to keep or else her life was meaningless?

322
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,799
It just doesn't seem to me to fit the picture.

323
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:54,959
I mean, she just fully devotedly involved in love with him, ready to go where he wants to go and ready to think they're going to live the whole rest of their lives together and that's going to be fine.

324
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:15,840
And you can't, I don't know what more you need to think that she had a defining commitment to him, except, well, not even, I was going to say, except to see the vulnerability and worry about it, because Kierkegaard admits, this is the way his objection sort of gets into Kierkegaard and worries me about, and should worry Kierkegaard.

325
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:35,199
Kierkegaard admits that you could be in a defining commitment and not be aware of the sword hanging over the head, not be aware of the vulnerability, therefore not needing to have faith, not thinking when you're getting more and more involved with anguish that you're doing something crazy.

326
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,439
I mean, once you get all that in there, you're saved.

327
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,240
But if you don't have all that, then I don't know what you're doing.

328
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:47,039
I don't see why that person should be said to be in despair.

329
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,839
I think I should go back to the drawing board and bring you a report if I get any further.

330
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:57,559
Or you can come to office hours and tell me about it, either at this one or afterward.

331
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,160
I just think that's wonderful.

332
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:01,240
It's very good to have hard problems like this.

333
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,199
We'll learn something.

334
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,839
We'll learn something if we ever get it figured out.

335
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:15,559
We may learn Kierkegaard just makes a mistake, that he can't make the strong claim he's making about despair, or we'll learn that he does get it right and I'm making a mistake.

336
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:18,520
Either way, it's very illuminating, it'll be illuminating.

337
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,520
Okay, let's go on.

338
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:28,919
So, despair is a world-defining and eternal experience.

339
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:33,399
It's like the negative version of a defining commitment.

340
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:46,839
And people who discover it discover that their whole life has been meaningless and hasn't worked no matter how much fun they were thinking they were having.

341
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,879
You'd have to think that your happiness was illusory looking back.

342
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:58,520
And you'd have to see you've never been happy and you never could be happy.

343
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:02,119
And okay.

344
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:07,879
Now we're on to the next issue.

345
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:42,319
Then the next issue is sort of how come this is the way we are built, that we're built looking at your chart with these two sets of factors, which are contradictory and can't be gotten together, either by denying one or the other, which will certainly not get them together, which is the Greek way, or by holding on to both of them, which can't get them together because there's no way to be detached and involved, infinite and finite, temporal and eternal, all at the same time, just on your own.

346
00:31:42,879 --> 00:31:56,559
And that makes, remember, of course, I just should, but there is a way to do it, all right, and that's on the other side, just to remind you, because there's so many things in the air right now, the middle of the long thing.

347
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,279
So, what is it to get out of despair?

348
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,440
Maybe this is a moment to say that first.

349
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,880
Are you really stuck in despair?

350
00:32:04,879 --> 00:32:20,480
Not if you get the relation to relate itself, if you relate to yourself or the relation relates itself to itself, that is, you take a stand on being these factors in a way that what?

351
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:24,399
You tell me, what do you have to add to get it to work?

352
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:28,880
You can do it by yourself.

353
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:31,119
What does it take to do it?

354
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:39,200
To get the factors together, to be finite and infinite, temporal and eternal, possible and necessary, all at the same time.

355
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,319
You all go listening, hope, or I should go home.

356
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,720
What?

357
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,240
Faith.

358
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,079
Well, faith is a part of it.

359
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:49,520
Faith is a part of it, all right.

360
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:54,799
But that's, but to tell you, what is it that you have to do that requires faith?

361
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,879
To put your question back one.

362
00:32:58,879 --> 00:33:00,159
You have to what?

363
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:07,279
Yes, you have to relate yourself to yourself by relating to another, something or other.

364
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:11,599
That's the middle paragraph on this page one.

365
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:19,279
If the relation which relates itself to itself has been constituted by another, then of course the relation is the third term.

366
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:27,400
And the relation, skipping a little, relates to that which has established the whole relation.

367
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:42,839
So you have to relate yourself to yourself by relating to another and just not, and relating to another, not just in any old way, but with infinite passion as a defining commitment.

368
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:51,959
And then that creates you as a new being, gives you an identity, puts the, you become, you get an infinite passion for something finite.

369
00:33:51,960 --> 00:34:07,400
You get it in time, you get something that in your life is forever, and in necessity, with something fixed in your life, you can then have both being fixed, something settled, and a lot of possibilities unsettled.

370
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,599
All that happens.

371
00:34:08,759 --> 00:34:13,320
It only happens if you relate yourself to yourself by relating to another.

372
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,720
And then comes her point from back there.

373
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,640
And how do you do that?

374
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:26,840
Well, there are all kinds of wrong ways to do it, fanatically and resign it with resignation.

375
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,920
But there's one right way to do it, and that's what?

376
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,599
Being the sword over the head of the beloved and do what?

377
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:45,160
Love anyway, defenselessly, more and more, as if it was the surest thing of all.

378
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,839
And now, and what do you need to be able to do that?

379
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,599
Faith.

380
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:58,360
You have to believe that even the impossible is possible, that this relation is absolutely secure and totally vulnerable.

381
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:03,319
And you can't, and if you believe that, you believe something utterly incomprehensible.

382
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,039
That's the paradox of existence.

383
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:13,039
If you try to stay in terms of beliefs, what the knight of faith is doing, you have to say, well, look at that.

384
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:17,360
The knight of faith believes that this is absolutely secure and absolutely vulnerable.

385
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,120
And the knight of faith has to say that to himself if he thinks about it.

386
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,920
But he can do something he can't understand if he has faith.

387
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,400
He can do something paradoxical, and that's it.

388
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:37,600
Then the two parts of the self will be related and everything will be okay.

389
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:52,480
That's the cure that we that the sickness unto death is a disease, a special kind of dialectical or eternal or whatever kind of disease.

390
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:59,280
And the cure for that kind of disease is unconditional commitment in a field of faith.

391
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,520
Okay, that's where we are.

392
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:20,160
So Christianity, and now comes this interesting issue, that Christianity, I think, I don't know if Kierkegaard thinks this, but I imagine he does, is in a certain sense the cause of the disease and the cure of it, where the disease is despair.

393
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,440
Now, the tricky part, we've done the cure of it a lot, that's just what we just went through.

394
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:32,000
It tells you to get a defining relation and that there is a, that faith will make it all work out fine.

395
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:41,360
But in this, I mean, it's hard to know just to what extent Kierkegaard thinks this about.

396
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:49,120
The question is: Does the self always come with these two factors that have to be realized, or else it's in despair?

397
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,039
Even if you're a Buddhist, even if you're in Greece?

398
00:36:53,039 --> 00:37:12,440
Or I think he thinks that Christianity, I hope he thinks, that Christianity invented the problem because Jesus was there, who was the God-man, who told people that they could have an infinite passion, should have, called them that.

399
00:37:12,759 --> 00:37:18,119
Then they discovered there was something like bliss, which is getting the two factors together.

400
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:22,200
Nobody in the ancient world had bliss, according to Dante.

401
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:30,520
The best they could do was limbo in the afterlife, where they wandered around and talked to each other and took it easy and it was very pleasant.

402
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,439
But bliss is a is bliss that goes with despair.

403
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:49,240
Only a view of the self, which is so amazingly contradictory and yet put togetherable, gives you the despair if you don't put it together and bliss if you do.

404
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:50,839
And where did you get this self?

405
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,839
Is it just sort of biological?

406
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:57,079
Given your DNA and mine, we all have these sets of factors.

407
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:59,000
That seems very unlikely.

408
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:07,720
You get it because in our traditions, the Hebrews sort of set it up that the mind and the body are equally essential.

409
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:22,679
And then God became man, meaning that Jesus went around saying that he was God and man and showed somehow that you could be put the eternal and temporal and all that.

410
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:31,799
And once you see it, that is, I mean, it's a little hard to follow this now, but somehow it gets put in the culture by the Christian community.

411
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,559
And then the Romans become Christians.

412
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:42,800
And in the background, a whole new understanding of how hard it is to be a human being and how terrific it is if you get it right.

413
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:52,559
It's harder than any ancients thought, or the Buddhists thought, or anybody like that ever thought, and it's more blissful if you get it right than anybody ever thought.

414
00:38:52,880 --> 00:39:00,720
And that's the peculiar sense, I think, in which Christianity is the disease for which it is the cure.

415
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:05,039
And now, that's probably what it means.

416
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:14,400
Talk about when you relate yourself to another, that is, relates yourself to what has established the whole relation.

417
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:23,360
That's the same thing as the phrase, you ground it transparently in the power that constituted the self.

418
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:27,039
These are just two different translations of the same idea.

419
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,960
So Jesus, I think you have to think, established this complicated kind of self.

420
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:41,839
It's like discovering that there's something that you really, really like, but you never noticed you really, really liked it.

421
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:46,160
But once you discover you really, really liked it, you discover you can't live without it.

422
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:52,799
And then you're both in trouble, but that's also a great new exciting thing.

423
00:39:52,800 --> 00:40:01,039
Well, if you just imagine that now, pushed to the limit, there is something called bliss that you discover that you can have.

424
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:05,359
And once you discover you can have it, you get to be a bliss addict.

425
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:20,800
And everybody in the culture is a bliss addict, either because they're directly raised as Christians and told all this story, or because it's all over in the literature, it's in the language, it's in the history of the culture, in this peculiar sense.

426
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:28,919
And everybody raised in the West, anyway, and only maybe, it has this kind of factors.

427
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:32,359
It's been established by what?

428
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,719
Well, I think by Jesus.

429
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:51,000
I mean, if it's true that he's the first one to come around and say you can have an unconditional commitment which gives you bliss and brings you together, and doesn't make you choose, like, remember the Greeks do, either let's satisfy the body part or let's satisfy the soul part.

430
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,520
This thing doesn't make you choose.

431
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,839
It says you're essentially body and soul.

432
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:59,400
You're essentially, and you can have both, even though they're contradictory.

433
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:17,960
Then you see that there is some sense in which, on this Kierkegaard picture, Jesus has got to be the power that posited it, but posited this kind of self by saying, have an unconditional, and by what now?

434
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,880
There's one little piece more missing, I think.

435
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:26,520
I'm just sort of trying to make up the story that I think Kierkegaard must have, though I can't give you any pages where he has it.

436
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:28,599
I see, I never turned on the lights back there.

437
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:31,559
I don't know if it matters, but it makes me happy to have them.

438
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:39,960
Now, so there are two ways, I think, that you can relate to the God-man.

439
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,399
Oh, no, I want to say one more thing.

440
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,599
Good, I don't want to skip it.

441
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:56,120
Kierkegaard realizes that he's got no argument, no rational argument, no scientific argument for claiming that we are a self made out of two contradictory factors.

442
00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:04,120
He gets it from reading the Bible, and the whole Bible, the Old Testament, but particularly the New Testament.

443
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:13,120
And he calls these books that are written in the highest Christian, by the highest Christian person, like Sickness Unto Death, dogmatic.

444
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:17,919
Dogmatic, now since the Enlightenment, dogmatic has come to mean a bad thing.

445
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,520
You ought to be able to give good arguments for everything and not just go around and say that's how it is.

446
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:31,760
When Kierkegaard says dogmatic, he means he knows it by way of the revelation that's in the Bible, and there's no other way to know it.

447
00:42:31,759 --> 00:42:33,599
There's no rational way to know it.

448
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,840
You can't prove it with biology.

449
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:42,960
You can't prove it by arguments like metaphysicians try to do and so forth.

450
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,160
You either got the revelation or you.

451
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:48,799
In a certain way, you could say either you believe it or you don't.

452
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:55,039
But I think in a certain way, everybody believes it once they're in it, once we're in this culture.

453
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:56,960
We may outgrow it.

454
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,880
Nietzsche, you'll see, is trying very hard to help us outgrow it.

455
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,680
He doesn't think it's a good idea to be bliss addicts.

456
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:12,079
But while you're in it, anyway, the revelation tells you you're in it.

457
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:17,200
And he doesn't claim to do anything but explain that revelation.

458
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,880
Now I think there's only one more piece to be put into that.

459
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,520
And that is, how do you relate to Jesus?

460
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:32,559
What is it to be transparently grounded in that something which established the relation?

461
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,719
And he doesn't even want to say God.

462
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:37,679
He wants to say something very, very general.

463
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:45,280
But somehow or other, something or other established the self the way it is.

464
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,680
And Jesus seems to be the one who did it.

465
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,599
So, now how do you relate to Jesus?

466
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:52,879
Well, there seem to be two ways.

467
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,879
I've been sort of telling you one, and I think I should tell you both.

468
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,480
I've sort of told you both.

469
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,039
And I don't know which one Kierkegaard is for.

470
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:01,319
Maybe he thinks they're both.

471
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:02,599
Okay, I think that's what he thinks.

472
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:11,000
If you're a disciple, a contemporary of Jesus, you can have an unconditional relation to Jesus.

473
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:17,880
And then you've got a big risk because he might get crucified and he might even despair on the cross and give up the whole mission.

474
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,199
And it might look like he was never a savior at all.

475
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:24,840
It's a very risky business to be a contemporary of Jesus.

476
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:29,320
But if you've got faith, you can do it.

477
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,480
And that's one possibility.

478
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:48,520
I think the other one I think that Kierkegaard is more interested in, because we're not disciples, and we can't sort of lose Jesus and be shocked by the fact that he despairs on the cross and we betray him like Peter afterward and all this kind of stuff, complicated things that happen.

479
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,239
It's all over.

480
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:52,840
I mean, we can't help but see it from this end where we are.

481
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:56,679
So that probably is not the way we should be behaving.

482
00:44:56,679 --> 00:45:07,559
Well, Kierkegaard, in the second of the books where he signs them with his highest Christian name, says Jesus is the paradigm.

483
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:12,120
That means he's the perfect example of something.

484
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:20,840
I've always thought, well, Jesus shows people what it is to be able to die for your friend, as he puts it.

485
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,800
You know, committed to somebody.

486
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:27,400
But maybe, and I think that's what Kierkegaard thinks.

487
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:36,119
But then you get into the funny question: but boy, you read the Bible, you don't find much about Jesus going around taking on a risky unconditional commitment.

488
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:38,440
What's his risky unconditional commitment?

489
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,119
Not enough, just any old friend.

490
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:48,559
I mean, it would have to be a friend like Augustine's friend, where your whole world and your identity is tied up with that friend, and that you don't hear about any such friend.

491
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:49,360
Yeah.

492
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:07,360
I mean, I think the mission is a time when you like to struggle with whether I don't believe them.

493
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,440
You're on my wavelength, but I want to go a little further.

494
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:22,800
I used to say, well, I bet Jesus is some kind of freedom fighter fighting for Israeli independence from those Romans.

495
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,039
And I used to think, of course, this is perfectly silly.

496
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:27,039
There's nothing in the Bible that supports it.

497
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:41,119
Now, to my amazement, there's a whole industry of Christian theologians arguing that he was and giving arguments like, if you know the Bible, is it Peter who cuts off the ear of one of the Romans who comes to tap with you?

498
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:46,960
Well, what's as they say, what is Peter, who's supposed to be a non-what are the non-aggressive?

499
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,559
I never can remember the word.

500
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:51,839
A passive resistance kind of Christian.

501
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,199
That was Jesus's way.

502
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:54,480
You know, turn the other cheek.

503
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:00,639
What is this turn the other cheek person doing with a sword, carrying it around, and cutting off an ear from the Roman?

504
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:08,399
And the other one that they talk a lot about is this funny thing in the Bible, those of you who know it, that Jesus keeps saying things and then saying, but don't tell anybody.

505
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:20,079
And as if maybe he's giving them some kind of code about where the next meeting is going to be or something, and saying, but you can understand this, but don't go around telling people who are not on our side.

506
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:20,880
I mean, maybe.

507
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:27,960
I mean, it isn't as if something you have to believe, and it isn't something this course requires, but it seems to me it's a missing piece.

508
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:47,400
If Jesus is a paradigm, an outstanding example, then he ought to be someone taking a risky unconditional commitment, and maybe it's such a secret sort of underground operation that it doesn't show up very clearly in what the people are writing down, which becomes the New Testament.

509
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,400
I think that would be very interesting.

510
00:47:49,400 --> 00:48:12,039
But it's clear, this as much as clear, that he became a paradigm, whether anybody knew what it was or not that he was committed to, because Dante's way of relating to Beatrice, remember, puts Beatrice in the place of Jesus as Dante's Savior, because you can have an unconditional commitment to anything, something.

511
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:13,800
Remember the dog last time.

512
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,799
I remembered, by the way, that she also wouldn't wear belts or fur or anything.

513
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:26,120
I mean, this woman who had this unconditional commitment to her dog, to everything that was important to her, got related to it.

514
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:40,280
That's fine, because the paradigm, according to Kierkegaard, would be that there was something finite for which you had an infinite passion, and there was something presumably that Jesus had an infinite passion for, or we just don't know what.

515
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,399
So either you have an infinite passion for him or you imitate him.

516
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,960
And he had an infinite passion for something else.

517
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:57,239
That creates you as a contradictory self, and then that gives you the solution.

518
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:07,639
But it is transparently grounded in the power that established you as a set of factors.

519
00:49:07,639 --> 00:49:18,079
Let me tell you why I'm telling you all this, because I told you a simpler version last time I talked about it, and I decided that was just wrong, and I have to tell you the complicated truth as I see it.

520
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:27,120
I mean, I said that what you get when you get a defining commitment is it creates you as the individual you are.

521
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:37,680
And that's the sense in which you are transparently grounded in everything you do in the power that posited you as an individual.

522
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:40,079
But that's not really what Kierkegaard says.

523
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,639
It's the self that got posited.

524
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:44,160
The two factors.

525
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:51,200
You're transparently grounded in the power that posited it, not the power that posited you.

526
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:56,000
And the it is who created the self with the contradictory factors.

527
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:07,920
Now somehow you can be transparently grounded in that which established the relation, as he puts it, established itself or been established by something else.

528
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:13,280
Okay, so the self gets created by the something.

529
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,360
That's the story I just tried to tell you.

530
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:32,480
It's not enough that what your defining commitment creates you as an individual, that your defining commitment is tied up with the fact that you've been created as a self with two essential factors, that you can't get rid of either one, and you can't get them together by yourself.

531
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,880
All that got established somehow.

532
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:39,120
And I'm just trying to give you a story about how it got established.

533
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,879
It's so different, by the way.

534
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:55,960
I keep coming back every once in a while to Buddhism because my son has become now a very, very religious Buddhist, and he argues with me all the time in a nice way and gives me all kinds of metaphysical arguments about how to be a good Buddhist.

535
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,360
But one thing is sure.

536
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:03,319
He's not interested in taking a risky commitment to anything.

537
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:11,240
Non-attachment is absolutely crucial to his way of thinking of things because every kind of attachment will lead to suffering.

538
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:19,079
And I said, well, don't you want to be committed to your job and find it really very interesting and fulfilling and so important you can't live without it?

539
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:23,240
And he said, no, of course not, because then if you lose your job, you'll suffer.

540
00:51:23,239 --> 00:51:35,479
And so there's a whole other picture of what it is to be a self in which you want to get rid of the involvement side of the self in order to avoid suffering and get some other kind of bliss.

541
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:39,799
I don't know what kind of bliss, the bliss that doesn't come with anguish and so forth.

542
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:47,319
But it's not something so if you ask yourself, does Kierkegaard think the Buddhists are in despair?

543
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:49,559
I think the answer is no.

544
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:52,679
Who doesn't think they're in the bliss and despair business?

545
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:54,200
They're in something else.

546
00:51:54,199 --> 00:51:58,039
But we, he thinks, are in despair.

547
00:51:58,039 --> 00:51:58,680
Yeah.

548
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:05,320
The Buddhists, he might argue that, right?

549
00:52:06,759 --> 00:52:12,520
From within our world, they are missing something important.

550
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:23,319
Now, and I think he would say that because we've had a revelation which shows us that there are possibilities for the self beyond what they can see.

551
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,359
He would say that.

552
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:30,039
From within the revelation, dogmatically, it has to look that way to us.

553
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,400
Or, I mean, it would be, that they're missing something.

554
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,599
And therefore, we would have to say they were in lower immediacy.

555
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:37,120
Right.

556
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:58,640
But, and we, I guess then, I think I see what you're up to, then, and rightly, we would have to say they would be in despair, or else we'd have to say, and I think that's what Dante would say, they just missed out on something, and they are, and that has the disadvantage that they don't feel bliss, but it has the advantage that they don't feel despair either.

557
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:00,319
And we can see that and say that.

558
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:12,320
Dante, as a good Christian, as I say, puts all the pagans, and if he knew the Buddhists, he put them there too, in limbo, which is neither hell nor paradise, and so forth.

559
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:23,679
So, anyway, you could take a view that we know they're missing something, but that doesn't mean that they can't have their own kind of fulfillment.

560
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:26,480
The Greeks did and the Buddhists do.

561
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:35,199
And it would be, from our point of view, despair, because they're missing this much more superversion.

562
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,199
And we have to say that.

563
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:38,879
That's what we believe.

564
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:41,840
That's what I believe anyway, when I argue with my son.

565
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:45,199
But they will say, no, no, you're all wrong.

566
00:53:45,199 --> 00:53:51,280
You've got yourself into this huge tangle of bliss and anguish and despair.

567
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:59,600
And there is another form of life and meditation which will get you some kind of experience without all that hang-up.

568
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:06,960
And there's no place where you can stand, I think, and say, well, they're just wrong.

569
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:08,879
You can just be dogmatic.

570
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,839
We're back to that again.

571
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:19,360
You can say, if you live in the revelation and believe in the revelation and are formed by the revelation, they're certainly going to look wrong to you.

572
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,800
Yeah.

573
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,000
That's fascinating.

574
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:29,879
You hear a question.

575
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,559
What if you became a Buddhist?

576
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:34,520
If you'd been raised in the West, would you be in despair?

577
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,360
I think so.

578
00:54:36,759 --> 00:54:39,480
But my son certainly doesn't think so.

579
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,760
And it's a tough one.

580
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:44,440
I don't know.

581
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:47,480
I guess, you know what I really think?

582
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:50,440
Enough meditation and you can get out of it.

583
00:54:50,440 --> 00:55:02,120
I mean, after being alone for 10 hours, for 10 days, as he's done, but without seeing another human being or saying anything and meditating all the time, who knows what it does to your neurons?

584
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,640
You may end up so much reborn that you're out of it.

585
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:11,720
I think maybe he okay.

586
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:21,880
Wow.

587
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,359
But is it a commitment to something vulnerable?

588
00:55:24,759 --> 00:55:32,840
Is it some commitment that you are, that you could lose in such a way as to have this devastating grief effect on your life?

589
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:40,440
It could be a waste of your life because you could realize you were in lower immediacy.

590
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,640
Yes, but you can't realize that from within it.

591
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:48,760
I mean, it isn't as if, I mean, when you're in it, it looks safe enough.

592
00:55:49,639 --> 00:56:02,120
And if you were out of it, I mean, I guess I have to say everybody's sort of capable of being reborn as a Christian, with a Christian self, and with a comm and get a commitment and so forth.

593
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:09,240
And then you would have discovered, then you would have looked like you were in despair all along when you were a Buddhist, say.

594
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:14,319
But it isn't as if the Buddhism is on its own terms vulnerable.

595
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:20,559
It isn't as if it sees the sword hanging over the head of Buddhism and then goes on as if it's the surest thing of all.

596
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:27,520
This vulnerability story is a part of the finite temporal story, and they got rid of the finite temporal.

597
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,120
They're only off in the eternal infinite dimension.

598
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:34,399
Okay, let me, yeah, this is all interesting.

599
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,600
Go ahead.

600
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:47,760
Well, she says, Can you think of Buddhism as repressing the finite body part?

601
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:51,839
You can, we can, inside the revelation.

602
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,759
Yeah, dogmatically think of it.

603
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:57,440
But if I ask you, yeah, but what's your argument for thinking of it that way?

604
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:09,680
You know, can you, you got any, you look inside people's heads or you make rational arguments, you'd see, you could look at it that way, but that's only because you've got, you're inside this culture.

605
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:11,440
Then you will look at it that way.

606
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,239
You'll say, and that's what we did when we looked at the Greeks.

607
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:21,200
You'll say, well, they're just denying that the one half of the self is essential, and they're saying the other half is essential.

608
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:24,000
They get rid of the body finite temporal.

609
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,480
That's all too risky and suffering.

610
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:37,599
They identify with the eternal, infinite, possible, and that gives them a freedom from suffering and a certain kind of bliss.

611
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:39,520
I don't know what their word for it is.

612
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,279
And now, now the question, I'll go back to you.

613
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,920
Were they repressing the other half of the self?

614
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,600
Well, we think so.

615
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:49,440
But they don't think so.

616
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,480
And there's no position again from which to prove who's right.

617
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:59,799
I believe it.

618
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:01,960
That's right.

619
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,239
They try to do something.

620
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:05,960
I mean, I haven't been lectured enough yet by my son.

621
00:58:06,199 --> 00:58:07,240
Give me more time.

622
00:58:07,239 --> 00:58:16,680
But they're trying to do something to do something to the body part, such that they will get some kind of special experience with the other part.

623
00:58:16,679 --> 00:58:18,679
And they think that's what it's all about.

624
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:27,079
One way to put it, if you're having this discussion with any Buddhist friends, is he keeps telling me the right way to get over suffering.

625
00:58:27,079 --> 00:58:30,279
And I keep wanting to say to him, suffering isn't what it's all about.

626
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,720
It's about meaning.

627
00:58:31,719 --> 00:58:35,639
And the unconditional commitment is getting meaning in your life.

628
00:58:35,639 --> 00:58:39,879
And it gets tied up with a great deal of possible grief and suffering and so forth.

629
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,840
But it's worth suffering to get meaning.

630
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:48,760
And he says, no, no, there's only one really important thing in the world, and that is you shouldn't suffer.

631
00:58:48,759 --> 00:58:50,759
And that, and so.

632
00:58:50,759 --> 00:58:51,959
And what do you say to that?

633
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:59,879
Well, you say you, what view you have about that will depend on what language you've grown up in and what tradition and what sort of family and so forth.

634
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:00,359
Yeah.

635
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,319
What about the culture?

636
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,799
Oh, oh, well, the atheist.

637
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:22,039
Ah, you're just, she's asking about what are the people who, what about the people who want to break out of this whole bliss addiction and this unconditional commitment story?

638
00:59:22,039 --> 00:59:23,799
Well, you're getting ahead of the story.

639
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:25,639
And they are atheists.

640
00:59:25,639 --> 00:59:27,160
And they are nihilists.

641
00:59:27,159 --> 00:59:36,039
And they think that there must be something that is better than meaning and better than freedom from suffering.

642
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:38,360
And guess who their leader is?

643
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:39,800
Nietzsche.

644
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,119
And we will get to Nietzsche.

645
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:45,199
Nietzsche wants to break out of this, but he hates Buddhism as much as he hates Christianity.

646
00:59:45,679 --> 01:00:01,360
He's got his own new religion, which a lot of us are in now, because this we're kind of transitioned between the culture, which was a religious culture, and a secular kind of culture.

647
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:05,680
And so, your question is fine, and of course, we will get there.

648
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:07,760
Anything else?

649
01:00:07,759 --> 01:00:08,400
Yeah.

650
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:11,839
Logic?

651
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:12,720
No.

652
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:14,320
I certainly don't.

653
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,039
It's funny.

654
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:17,759
In fact, it's so, but you can't appreciate this.

655
01:00:17,759 --> 01:00:26,320
My son gives me these 4,000-year-old Buddhist arguments about space and time and how they're unreal and the objects are empty.

656
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:29,520
And it sounds exactly like Kant's critique of pure reason.

657
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:33,840
I mean, you can get to this, apparently, by logic and rationality.

658
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:39,120
You can get to Buddhism, or you can get to what Kant calls transcendental idealism.

659
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:41,520
And it looks very similar.

660
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:43,120
It's amazing.

661
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:47,839
I think, this is just totally crazy, probably, but it's certainly striking.

662
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:51,679
It looks to me like it's no accident that a philosophy.

663
01:00:52,239 --> 01:01:16,639
Either there's some really sort of innate way the mind works, and logic and rationality just come out the same, whether you're doing it in Tibet or in Königsberg, Germany, or I think, in my opinion, having talked to my son and learned a lot from him, that we got this Buddhist thing straight out of Buddhism.

664
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:24,879
Plato went away for a while, and Plato came to visit people who had something which people would talk about, the mystery religions.

665
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,759
I don't know much about this, but I know this.

666
01:01:27,079 --> 01:01:33,320
Plato came back believing in the reincarnation of souls, and he didn't believe it when he left.

667
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,880
And it's a totally basic Buddhist idea.

668
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:39,079
And he came back believing in karma, though he didn't call it karma.

669
01:01:39,079 --> 01:01:55,640
He said that the souls, before they got re-put in a body, which was a bad thing for them, but it had to be done, before they got re-put in a body, the past life they had determined what life they chose for their next life.

670
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,599
See, if you know Buddhism, that sounds very familiar.

671
01:01:58,599 --> 01:02:06,520
What they did and thought and so forth in one life is going to determine whether they get a better life next round or a worse life next round.

672
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:07,799
Plato got that.

673
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,800
Where did he get that all of a sudden?

674
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,480
I think he got it from the Buddhist.

675
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:15,639
And then you get all sorts of further things, which I won't go into with it.

676
01:02:15,639 --> 01:02:21,559
Plato's got once you believe that there's this other world.

677
01:02:21,559 --> 01:02:30,679
And he certainly thinks that getting stuck with the body is a kind of suffering, and you should die to the body as much as possible, and so forth.

678
01:02:30,679 --> 01:02:40,199
So it may not be an accident that if you do philosophy, lots of the arguments that come up look like they come from the Buddhist.

679
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:41,559
I don't know.

680
01:02:41,559 --> 01:02:42,200
Yeah.

681
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,520
Aha, very good question.

682
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,440
Is my son the Buddhist going to play with?

683
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,719
The answer is yes and no.

684
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:57,160
He was, but he isn't anymore.

685
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,320
It's only happened over the last year.

686
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,400
He was addicted to computer games.

687
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:05,839
He was, oh, I just want to go into all the profoundly detail.

688
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,879
His life was a certain paradigm mess.

689
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:20,800
And after a year of Buddhism and meditating and doing all these things that he's doing, he's completely clean of computer games and everything else.

690
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:23,280
He's a super kid.

691
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:25,520
What?

692
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,159
Maybe a year and a half, but boy, is he throwing himself into it?

693
01:03:30,159 --> 01:03:31,440
He studies courses.

694
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,599
He goes off to their retreats all by himself for 10 days.

695
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,119
He gives up wine.

696
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:38,320
He gives up meat.

697
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,880
I mean, it's not trivial.

698
01:03:41,679 --> 01:03:43,440
And apparently, you could change.

699
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:50,159
I mean, I'm amazed how much you can change a person if they find sort of the religion that's what they need.

700
01:03:50,159 --> 01:04:06,160
I mean, he was so, as long as we're putting all the family laundry on, he's the one who feels that his childhood was so miserable that he won't, unless we can change it, he was not going to do anything in the future that could make us happy.

701
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:10,000
And now he's given up that attitude, and he loves to make us happy.

702
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:17,439
And he sends email remembering far-off things in the past where he feels he did something that hurt us, and he apologizes we don't even remember.

703
01:04:17,759 --> 01:04:18,640
Okay.

704
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:20,719
That's an ad for Buddhism.

705
01:04:20,719 --> 01:04:24,000
I give you an ad for Christianity now and an ad for Buddhism.

706
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,840
But I saw another hand.

707
01:04:27,759 --> 01:04:28,800
Okay, yeah.

708
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:32,960
Falls in love.

709
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,520
Well, I wish I would, I'm eagerly waiting to see you.

710
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,320
Maybe, maybe I'll bring you a report by the end of the semester.

711
01:04:44,239 --> 01:04:49,840
I don't think Buddhists fall in love, at least certainly not in the romantic way we do, because they'd be suffering.

712
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:55,199
But they do something together and get married and have kids, so I don't know what to make of that yet.

713
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,879
He'll give me lectures on it when the time comes.

714
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:06,280
Okay, I want to go back to other left, what I call leftover issues.

715
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:16,600
And the main leftover issue, this comes by office hours where 10, 12 people were beating up on me over mainly.

716
01:05:16,599 --> 01:05:21,240
But the hard thing to understand what God is in all this.

717
01:05:21,239 --> 01:05:28,039
And the first thing I want to tell you is don't worry about it and don't get all hung up about it in your papers.

718
01:05:28,039 --> 01:05:29,799
It's the phenomena that matters.

719
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:38,039
Remember when Kierkegaard says that the lad is in love with the princess and he can't have her and it's about this that everything turns.

720
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:46,360
That's the phenomena of all we've talked about, unconditional commitments, risk, resignation, faith, and so forth.

721
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:57,959
But Kierkegaard is also trying to map his Regina experience onto this phenomenology of the lad and the princess, the sort of romantic love story.

722
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:01,960
And it doesn't always work very well.

723
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:09,320
But I'll try to put it, tell you how I see it, and try to put it together as best I can.

724
01:06:09,639 --> 01:06:21,800
So there is this problem of God is the, there is something called the absolute, and Abraham has an absolute relation to the absolute, which tells him to sacrifice Isaac.

725
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:24,520
Now, Kierkegaard doesn't say this absolute is God.

726
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:38,920
Kierkegaard doesn't say anything about God in fear and trembling, as far as I know, except that relating to God with love, like the Salentio does, is a kind of despair and is the wrong thing to do.

727
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:43,520
But there are a lot of sort of god-like something or others running around in the book.

728
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:47,680
And one of them is the absolute relation to the absolute.

729
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:54,320
And then you get the puzzle that people say: but how can anything trump the unconditional commitment?

730
01:06:54,320 --> 01:07:03,120
How could there be this absolute coming in and saying, you have to sacrifice Isaac, you have to lose Isaac, you have to go against the ethical?

731
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:11,120
Where does this get the authority to say those things if the unconditional commitment is the highest authority in your life?

732
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:13,360
And Beatrice is your God person.

733
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:14,239
Who can come in?

734
01:07:14,719 --> 01:07:18,319
How could anybody come in and say to Dante, you have to sacrifice Beatrice?

735
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:21,520
And certainly Beatrice isn't going to say so.

736
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,880
Well, then you have to think about it this way, I believe.

737
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:44,240
God is something like there is some force, and I don't think it helps to call it God, but this absolute is the tells him to sacrifice Isaac, is the absolute opponent of his absolute commitment.

738
01:07:44,239 --> 01:07:53,359
That is, the absolute commitment comes up against something which says, you've got to be ready to give up Isaac.

739
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:57,200
You've got to live in such a way that you can give up Isaac.

740
01:07:57,199 --> 01:07:59,919
That doesn't come from his absolute commitment.

741
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:05,120
That's the only thing that his absolute commitment can't trump.

742
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:11,679
God there, the absolute, that's making him sacrifice Isaac, is the sword hanging over the head of the beloved.

743
01:08:11,679 --> 01:08:21,279
I mean, it's the absolute fact that if you get committed to something finite, you're at the mercy of the vulnerableness of it.

744
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:36,039
And that's the role, as far as I can see, that this absolute relation to the absolute, forcing Abraham to face the fact that you've got to be prepared to sacrifice Isaac, that's what it's better amount to.

745
01:08:36,999 --> 01:08:47,559
He better accept, that is Abraham, and integrate in his life the impossibility of a safe, stable, defining relation to whatever.

746
01:08:47,559 --> 01:08:51,320
Because there is no such thing as a safe, stable, defining relation.

747
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:53,400
There's always the risk.

748
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:58,759
And God is, or this absolute force, is the risk.

749
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:03,319
Now, but there's more puzzling things which I want to talk about.

750
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:14,679
How in the world can this absolute say that you should give up your defining relation?

751
01:09:14,679 --> 01:09:25,400
Not just that it could be taken away from you, but somehow there's an authority in your life that says you have to get rid of it right now.

752
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:33,319
I mean, Abraham has to sacrifice Isaac right now, and Kierkegaard has to sacrifice Regina right now, that is, break his engagement.

753
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:35,079
This is the anti-ethical part.

754
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:42,119
I mean, that's different than the absolute coming in and saying Isaac might die is one thing.

755
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:46,279
The absolute coming in and saying you have to do it.

756
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:48,919
You have to break with your defining relation.

757
01:09:48,919 --> 01:09:50,839
What could ever tell you that?

758
01:09:50,839 --> 01:09:53,719
Your defining relation is the most important thing in your life.

759
01:09:53,719 --> 01:09:58,440
How could it or anything else tell you you have to break with your defining relation?

760
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:06,679
Well, then I think it gets really murky, but in a very interesting way, you have to ask, well, what's the phenomenon?

761
01:10:06,679 --> 01:10:16,159
Well, it looks like there's some higher, truer calling, calling Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, but for what?

762
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,480
One doesn't know.

763
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:23,599
And Kierkegaard is sacrificing Regina for what?

764
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:25,599
And he doesn't know.

765
01:10:25,919 --> 01:10:38,719
And it looks like what this is about, although Kierkegaard never says so, or I think wouldn't even admit it, is that it's saying you don't really have a defining commitment to Regina.

766
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:48,159
There is something else that's calling you, some other destiny that you don't know yet, but it's already telling you, don't get involved with Regina.

767
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:54,959
If you get married and have a wife and lots of kids, you won't be able to fulfill your calling.

768
01:10:54,959 --> 01:11:09,279
And something's calling Abraham, because he's trying always to complete this parallel, who is telling him, yeah, Isaac is important and being father of the faith is important, but something else you need to be true to is even more important.

769
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:13,119
But certainly Abraham doesn't know what it is.

770
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:16,079
But never mind Abraham, this is just a story.

771
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:19,759
I think it's important that Kierkegaard doesn't know what it is.

772
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:23,279
And there is some kind of phenomena like that.

773
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:26,239
It's another case of doing what you can't understand.

774
01:11:26,639 --> 01:11:35,520
It's a special weird case of giving up what seems to be your identity in order to find out later, who you really are.

775
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:40,879
It's something Kierkegaard can't really touch and deal with in here, but it's in the background somehow.

776
01:11:40,879 --> 01:11:51,440
Well, by that I mean Kierkegaard's going to turn out to be the greatest modern, the greatest Christian theologian since, I don't know, Luther, if he was a theologian.

777
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,879
I mean, he's a very, very important thinker.

778
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:56,679
He had a big deal mission.

779
01:11:56,679 --> 01:11:59,400
All existentialist stuff comes from him.

780
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:04,839
And I don't think he could have done it with a bunch of kids running around and so forth.

781
01:12:04,839 --> 01:12:08,119
So, and he was doing something he didn't understand.

782
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:27,319
He was giving up something which he felt was his defining relation, but he was doing it in a way which, if you look at it from later, which we're not allowed to do, remember, because he wasn't living later, but if you looked at it from later, you'd see Kierkegaard was really being called by a calling which trumped what looked like his other calling.

783
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:29,959
I think that's how you have to think about it.

784
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:31,879
And now let's see what else.

785
01:12:31,879 --> 01:12:34,279
I think maybe that's what I want to say.

786
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:44,200
Yeah, all these other things have come up in the discussion anyway.

787
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:46,199
Let me just keep looking at this.

788
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:46,839
Ha!

789
01:12:46,839 --> 01:12:47,959
A whole other issue.

790
01:12:47,959 --> 01:12:48,679
Four minutes.

791
01:12:48,679 --> 01:12:50,279
I'll just touch on it.

792
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:52,919
Can you have a defining commitment to the ethical?

793
01:12:52,919 --> 01:12:54,440
That came up a lot.

794
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:55,959
That's a tough one.

795
01:12:56,759 --> 01:13:04,440
Having been beaten on for a while about that, I have a new idea, which I will run fast by you, that there are two different kinds of ethical.

796
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:05,959
There's the Greek ethical.

797
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:11,879
Agamemnon can't have a defining commitment to the ethical because being king is a role.

798
01:13:11,879 --> 01:13:17,799
And doing the ethical thing is a job that anybody could and should do who was king.

799
01:13:17,799 --> 01:13:22,360
And you can't get an individual definition out of doing your job as king.

800
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:28,440
But since the Greeks didn't know anything about being individual, according to Kierkegaard, it's not a problem.

801
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:31,159
Agamemnon did what he was supposed to do.

802
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:36,919
He subsumed one ethical under a higher ethical and did his job as king.

803
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,959
The issue comes with Martin Luther King.

804
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:43,679
Martin Luther King is a very interesting, complicated case.

805
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:50,879
When I introduced him into the discussion early on, it was as if, look at this guy, he's got an unconditional commitment.

806
01:13:50,879 --> 01:13:56,480
He's ready to die for justice for the black people here in the United States and now.

807
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:57,440
And that's still right.

808
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,759
That's exactly what he's doing.

809
01:13:59,759 --> 01:14:03,839
But what's interesting about it is it's sort of ethical, too.

810
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,839
And I didn't mention it.

811
01:14:05,839 --> 01:14:09,119
Because what Martin Luther King is doing is intelligible.

812
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:18,400
He's not in, it would look like, in the anguish of doing something absolutely disgusting, and he's doing something terrific.

813
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:29,919
So he's not a good example, right off, of anybody going against the ethical, although he's a good example of having an unconditional commitment to something.

814
01:14:29,919 --> 01:14:30,639
Yeah.

815
01:14:31,599 --> 01:14:34,400
No, because, well, that's the right question.

816
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,839
Is he a tragic hero?

817
01:14:35,839 --> 01:14:41,360
No, because there's something non-universal and individual about what he's doing.

818
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,239
It's a category Kierkegaard didn't work out.

819
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:47,360
I would like to give it as a paper topic, but I think it's too hard.

820
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:54,959
Martin Luther King felt not that he was a king in the sense of Agamemnon King, he was a prophet.

821
01:14:54,959 --> 01:15:01,599
And prophets are called as individuals to do something now to the people.

822
01:15:01,999 --> 01:15:04,719
And there's a lot of unintelligibility in it.

823
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:07,280
Why does it have to be Martin Luther King who does it?

824
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:09,279
Why does it have to be done now?

825
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:15,440
Why do you have to take the risk of killing white kids from the North to help the people in Alabama?

826
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:20,320
It's sort of intelligible because he wants justice, and that's intelligible.

827
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:25,520
But how he's going about getting this justice has a lot of unintelligibility in it.

828
01:15:26,679 --> 01:15:33,959
But, and this is the last thought on it, it's still something that he is not in anguish about.

829
01:15:33,959 --> 01:15:42,279
Because in the last talk before he's killed, remember he says, I've been on the mountain and I've seen the promised land.

830
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:47,879
That's prophet talk, but that says the future will show me to be right.

831
01:15:47,879 --> 01:15:53,799
And remember, Kierkegaard says his knight of faith, suspending the ethical, can't say that.

832
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,719
So where is Martin Luther King?

833
01:15:55,719 --> 01:15:57,959
Well, he's kind of a Christian ethical.

834
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:04,119
He's more unintelligible than Agamemnon and more individual than Agamemnon.

835
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:13,639
But he is still intelligible to himself and he thinks he understands his mission and people understand him in terms of his mission.

836
01:16:13,639 --> 01:16:23,639
Yeah, I don't have more to say about that, except I think I owed you an attempt to explain why Martin Luther King sort of works in the Course and sort of doesn't.

837
01:16:23,639 --> 01:16:24,279
Okay.
