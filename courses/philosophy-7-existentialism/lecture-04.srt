1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,560
So we've talked about the fact that what Kierkegaard is interested in is something very special in our Western culture: unconditional commitment to something finite which gives you your identity, which gives you a world in which what's important and not important is sorted out, and which is irreversible and vulnerable.

2
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:29,280
And that's very strange.

3
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:44,360
That raises the question: why should you ever get into such a kind of relation if its ending is going to destroy you and your world, and it's very likely to end sooner or later, but maybe sooner than you end, and then you'll be in trouble.

4
00:00:44,921 --> 00:00:47,961
In that sense, this kind of relation is always impossible.

5
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,640
It's not just like the prince, the lab can't marry the princess because they're of a different class.

6
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:03,721
It's impossible in some, it's the wrong kind of relation for anybody to think makes sense to do.

7
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:06,601
And in that sense, it's impossible.

8
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:14,840
It can't do the job that it ought to do, namely, be a solid foundation for your identity and your world.

9
00:01:15,161 --> 00:01:18,360
It should be somehow guaranteed, and it's not.

10
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:36,680
But Kierkegaard thinks that only through this kind of defining commitment to something finite and vulnerable, and a kind of eternal commitment to something temporal, can you have a meaningful life?

11
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:47,880
So, and moreover, this can't be a commitment to some kind of idea, some future utopia, because that's not finite and temporal enough.

12
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:56,120
It has to be something that tells you from moment to moment what you have to do next and what you can ignore as irrelevant.

13
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:07,321
And if it's going to be a fully meaningful life, if it's going to be the most meaningful life you could possibly get, it's going to have to be something that you'd be willing to die for.

14
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:11,081
It's not enough that you have a job that will tell you from day to day.

15
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,240
This came out in office hours yesterday.

16
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,921
Always learn new things.

17
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:24,321
A student came in with a good counterexample to why do you need to have an unconditional commitment just to know from day to day what's important to do and what's not.

18
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:27,280
If you have a job and like it, you'll know that.

19
00:02:27,441 --> 00:02:37,681
Or if you're devoted, as this person said, to some kind of science, which most a lot of people in the university are, doesn't that tell you what's important and not important?

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,080
And I was puzzled by that, but I think the answer is yes, it does, in a mild way, tell you that.

21
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:53,840
Just like playing having a role of husband and wife tell you what your jobs are, so to speak.

22
00:02:53,841 --> 00:03:05,360
And Kierkegaard talks about marriage and how it's a good thing, but there's a kind of marriage which is just, which is not the highest kind of commitment.

23
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,520
Not that this highest kind of commitment couldn't show up in marriage, in the picture of romantic love.

24
00:03:11,761 --> 00:03:15,041
It's supposed to go together, love and marriage.

25
00:03:15,841 --> 00:03:25,120
But it's there, and then there would be, there could be, both in your job and in your marriage, an unconditional commitment.

26
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:34,721
I mean, it's not excluded that you're unconditionally committed to doing science in such a way that it tells you what to do day by day.

27
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:45,601
And if it turns out your whole life you've been working on a hypothesis which finally turns out to be wrong, you'd be in the kind of lostness and grief from that.

28
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:55,921
But it requires that you are devoted to something finite and temporal so totally that if it failed, you'd be lost.

29
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:04,000
And that means you can't just be devoted to your job as a job or to your wife or husband as a role that you socially play.

30
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,440
It's got to be something you're willing to die for, to be a martyr for.

31
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:32,360
That is, if it's going to have the kind of super meaningfulness that it's got to have, if you're going to have a life that's as joyful and blissful and meaningful as a human life can be, then it has to be a commitment to something finite and temporal, and in a way that you're willing to make sacrifices for it, and finally ultimate sacrifices.

32
00:04:33,081 --> 00:04:40,120
A French writer named Malreaux said that nothing is worth living for that isn't worth dying for.

33
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:47,161
It's that kind of experience or feeling or understanding that Kierkegaard has in mind.

34
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:52,681
So it has to be, your unconditional commitment has to be to something finite, temporal.

35
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,201
Those go together always.

36
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,481
That just means another person right here now.

37
00:04:57,481 --> 00:05:02,120
And to something which is crucially important to you.

38
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,760
And you can see it has to be if it's defined you.

39
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:11,961
Because if it's defined you, then you can't just stand back and say, well, I'm not going to sacrifice for it.

40
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,560
That's too much.

41
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:21,081
I mean, you have to sacrifice for it because you wouldn't be you and you wouldn't have the world you have if it wasn't there.

42
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,520
And you have to, so that you can't just wash your hands of it.

43
00:05:26,841 --> 00:05:28,041
We'll come back to that in a minute.

44
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,120
I didn't say that very clearly yet.

45
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:41,081
And the question is: is there any way to keep this meaning and commitment in your life and avoid the vulnerability?

46
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,640
That looks like what you'd want to do.

47
00:05:43,641 --> 00:05:47,560
And all the story about resignation is about that.

48
00:05:47,560 --> 00:06:05,200
The Knight of Resignation is able to perform an amazing sort of movement that any person who has the strength of will to do it can do it, which preserves the unconditional commitment and its meaning.

49
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,921
and your identity and does it in a way that's not vulnerable.

50
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,201
How that happens is going to become something much later.

51
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:22,000
We have to go through all the wrong ways first, the wrong ways of trying to make your commitment safe.

52
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:31,761
And so the first one is a little before your reading, but it's so important and has a kind of moral I want to give you.

53
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,520
I want to go back and read it.

54
00:06:33,521 --> 00:06:36,000
And that's, no, it's, why do I say it's before?

55
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,481
No, it's not.

56
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:38,880
It's on the first page, on page 57.

57
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:46,400
And 57 doesn't have a number on it, but he comes between 56 and 58, as you will rightly guess.

58
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:47,601
So here we are.

59
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:57,201
So I'm going to read a chunk of it because it's going to be both a statement.

60
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,080
I'll tell you first what I think it's why I'm reading a lot of it.

61
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:09,121
One, it's a clear statement of you can't have the bliss without the vulnerability, which is what the Knight of Resignation is trying to do.

62
00:07:09,121 --> 00:07:14,561
And we're going to see that all versions of Knights of Resignation fail to do it.

63
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:24,641
And it's going to tell you that it's going to show you that Kierkegaard's kind of Christianity doesn't give the usual meanings to the terms.

64
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:32,881
I wanted at some point to warn you against what, when I was an undergraduate anyway, people were warning us about stock responses.

65
00:07:32,881 --> 00:07:35,041
I don't know if that slogan is around.

66
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:54,680
That means don't, when you hear something about the afterlife or about faith or about God in this book and in Dostoevsky and in Nicholas, particularly in this book, don't just think that you know what that means because you've heard what you what you heard from whatever in Sunday school or in reading or something.

67
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,081
You'll see what he does with the afterlife here.

68
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,601
Okay, so here we go.

69
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:07,080
An old proverb I'm getting right at the beginning, pertaining to the outward and visible world says, only one who works gets bread.

70
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:09,560
Oddly enough, the saying doesn't apply.

71
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:16,121
By the way, every once in a while, what I'm reading is going to differ by a word or so from what you've got.

72
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:21,881
Sometimes that's me being dyslexic, but I think I am usually I can read, sort of.

73
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:28,521
But the trouble is that this translation that I'm reading from is just an earlier printing of the one you've got.

74
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:33,961
But every once in a while I notice that something's happened, like the word rest in another quote has turned to repose.

75
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,760
So if I'm reading along and it doesn't say what I read, somebody yell and stop me.

76
00:08:38,761 --> 00:08:45,081
And one, I may be just not seeing what's on the page, or else I should correct this version.

77
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,200
So does it say that?

78
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,800
Only one who works gets bread?

79
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,921
Or is that what it says?

80
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:50,041
Okay, I'm going on.

81
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:55,401
Oddly enough, the saying doesn't apply in the world to which it most properly belongs.

82
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:58,281
For the outward world is subject to the law of imperfection.

83
00:08:58,281 --> 00:09:05,001
There it happens time and again the one who gets bread is the one who does not, who gets bread is the one who does not work.

84
00:09:05,001 --> 00:09:09,720
The one who sleeps gets it in greater abundance than the one who labors.

85
00:09:10,121 --> 00:09:17,401
That's just a fancy way of saying that, as you all know, it isn't the way, it doesn't work out that you get what you deserve.

86
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:23,440
The one who works very, very hard finally and puts a lot of money in Enron's stock ends up broke.

87
00:09:23,761 --> 00:09:30,401
And the people who are running Enron and taking it easy and sleeping late make millions of dollars.

88
00:09:30,401 --> 00:09:37,441
In this case, maybe they're going to be punished, but you can't count on it in the everyday world.

89
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,521
But now, later, he says, skipping down to the middle of the page, it's otherwise in the world of the spirit.

90
00:09:43,521 --> 00:09:46,401
Here there prevails an eternal divine order.

91
00:09:46,401 --> 00:09:48,960
Here it does not rain on the just and unjust alike.

92
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,761
Here the sun does not shine on both good and evil, on both good and evil.

93
00:09:53,761 --> 00:10:00,001
Here only one who works gets bread, and only one who knows anguish finds rest.

94
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,281
Only one who descends to the underworld saves the loved one.

95
00:10:03,281 --> 00:10:06,321
Only one who draws the knife gets Isaac.

96
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:17,761
Okay, well that's to say that in the world of the spirit, whatever that is, and I'm going to talk about that in a minute, the people who take the risk get the rewards.

97
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:23,121
And always, and if you want to be safe, you can't get the bread.

98
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:29,121
And if you're willing to take the risk of the defining commitment, you will.

99
00:10:29,121 --> 00:10:31,681
Now, how that's going to happen, we don't know yet.

100
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,561
But in the world of the spirit, I want to talk about.

101
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,921
That you might think that means in the afterlife.

102
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:45,921
That even if something bad happens here, this is the way sort of orthodox Christians and Orthodox Buddhists too think about it.

103
00:10:45,921 --> 00:10:52,881
I mean, what happens here gets compensated for by whether you go to heaven or hell in the afterlife.

104
00:10:52,881 --> 00:10:57,200
And you'd think Hierkegaard's a Christian, but he he must be saying something like that.

105
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:06,041
Don't worry, in this life if bad things can happen to good people and good things happen to bad people, but in the world of the spirit, in the afterlife, everything gets fixed.

106
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,560
Well, that's not what he means.

107
00:11:07,881 --> 00:11:16,041
He says, let me just go on now to, where is it?

108
00:11:18,281 --> 00:11:20,601
Well, I better stick to my notes, then we'll find it.

109
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,921
Oh, that's what's earlier there.

110
00:11:22,921 --> 00:11:23,481
I knew.

111
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,680
Something's earlier.

112
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:35,081
Okay, he says right off that if you believe that it'll be settled in a future life, then you haven't understood what he's talking about.

113
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:43,961
When he says that only ones who live in risk will get bliss and eternal life, he means right here and now.

114
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:46,601
And he talks about that on page 53.

115
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,800
That's for this little important bit that's before your reading.

116
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,921
The bottom of the page.

117
00:11:56,921 --> 00:12:00,921
But Abraham had faith and faith for this life.

118
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:10,041
He's going to give you a weird definition of faith, which I won't even be able to finish till time after next, because next time it's the movie and the time after we're going to talk about Hiroshima.

119
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:13,321
But so what he means by faith is very complicated.

120
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,121
But whatever it is, it's faith for this life, not in the afterlife.

121
00:12:18,361 --> 00:12:20,201
And then how he explains that.

122
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:29,481
Yes, had his faith only been for a future life, it would have been easier to cast everything aside in order to hasten out of this world in which he did not belong.

123
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,841
But Abraham's faith was not of that kind, if there is such.

124
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,481
He doubts whether that even counts as faith to believe in the future other world.

125
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:43,480
For a faith like that is not really faith, but only its remotest possibility.

126
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:53,841
This faith that has some inkling of its object at the very edge of the field of vision, but remains separated from it by a yawning abyss in which despair plays its pranks.

127
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,361
Now, Kierkegaard's hard reading.

128
00:12:50,841 --> 00:12:55,921
It's hard to know.

129
00:12:56,401 --> 00:13:00,081
I know what that means, but I could see the first number ten times.

130
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,361
I read it, I didn't.

131
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:14,161
What he's saying is: faith in the future world where everything comes out all right is, on the one hand, a kind of glimmer that if you've got faith, everything is going to turn out all right.

132
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:22,401
That the amount of risk you take and the amount of bliss you've got and the amount of meaning you've got are all going to equal out.

133
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:34,401
But if you think that that's going to happen in some other world, then you're in a kind of despair because that's this yawning abyss in which despair plays its pranks.

134
00:13:34,401 --> 00:13:39,281
The abyss is, sort of, what's going to happen to you between now and when you die?

135
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:44,641
Well, you're sort of in despair for that part because it looks like that's up for grabs.

136
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:54,321
And the point is, somehow this rule that the more risk, the more bliss ought to apply right now, not only after you die.

137
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,841
And that's, and he says that, going on.

138
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,440
But it was for this life that Abraham believed.

139
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:10,161
He believed he would become old in his land, honored among his people, blessed in his kin, eternally remembered in Isaac, the dearest of his life.

140
00:14:10,161 --> 00:14:25,601
That is, he somehow believed, and this is the puzzling thing that we're not going to get to yet, that even though he was going to do God's will and kill Isaac, he was going to keep his identity as the father of the faith, and somehow that required Isaac.

141
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:28,560
But don't worry about that instance of it.

142
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:46,681
Just realize that Kierkegaard thinks that faith of the sort he's talking about, which is very strange and hard and paradoxical, promises you in this life all that you could ever have.

143
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,080
And whether there's another life afterward or not, he says in other places he's neutral about that.

144
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,041
He doesn't know.

145
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,761
Nobody knows what happens after you die.

146
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:58,761
But it doesn't, but it's not important for this because it better work out right.

147
00:14:58,761 --> 00:15:00,041
You better have the right attitude.

148
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:08,761
And somehow in the world, in this very world, if you've got the right kind of faith and the right kind of attitude, it's got to work out in the right kind of way.

149
00:15:08,761 --> 00:15:10,840
Or you should be in this faith.

150
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:15,481
That's the first thing to get out of the way.

151
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:35,001
So now back to Kierkegaard's view that there's a necessary connection between the way an unconditional commitment gives you an identity and meaning and its being risky and making you vulnerable to grief, total breakdown.

152
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:41,560
And that's because if it's concrete enough to give you day-by-day meaning, it's concrete enough to be lost.

153
00:15:41,561 --> 00:15:45,000
The slogan is, no risk, no bliss.

154
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:50,600
And all religions, I said at the end last time, try to get around this painful situation.

155
00:15:50,601 --> 00:16:10,840
And now we're going to start a sort of survey of the way people have tried to get around it and make it safe in this world, but make it safe in this world in a way that, in the end, doesn't work because they make it safe in this world by somehow giving up the finite and the temporal to make it safe.

156
00:16:10,841 --> 00:16:13,161
Because we have to look at how that happens.

157
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:21,921
So, first you get nights that you get people who aren't really knights.

158
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:30,240
That is, ways of not being a knight, of avoiding, of having defenses against unconditional commitment.

159
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:37,921
And that's something I want to cross out.

160
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,040
I just read something in my notes that I don't believe anymore.

161
00:16:44,641 --> 00:16:48,800
I believed it this afternoon while I was writing this, but I now think that's not right.

162
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:49,361
Okay.

163
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,881
Okay.

164
00:16:50,881 --> 00:16:53,760
So, so the but I do stick to this.

165
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:01,360
We're going to talk about first ways of avoiding the risk, modes of defending yourself, having defenses.

166
00:17:01,361 --> 00:17:04,960
And the first one is that he talks about.

167
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:11,041
I sort of gather them from all over the preliminary, the preamble from the heart.

168
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:16,161
The first way of not being a knight is simply just not to let yourself get committed.

169
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:24,960
By getting, by the, not letting anything be the whole content of your life.

170
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,641
That is, have lots of affairs.

171
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:33,120
There's a movie that's, you won't remember, it's a little too before your time, Shampoo.

172
00:17:33,121 --> 00:17:34,561
Has anybody seen shampoo?

173
00:17:34,561 --> 00:17:44,161
What's interesting about shampoo is everybody has other possible girlfriends, boyfriends, jobs always sort of on the horizon just in case something goes wrong with this one.

174
00:17:44,161 --> 00:17:44,720
Right?

175
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,560
And that's the first way of avoiding the risk.

176
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:53,520
On 72, Kierkegaard's talking about that.

177
00:17:55,841 --> 00:18:11,401
So the knight would have, this is how he differs from this person who's not doing it right, will then, in the first place, the very top of 72, will then, in the first place, have the strength to concentrate the whole of his life's content and the meaning of reality into a single wish.

178
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:13,240
That is, you don't spread it around.

179
00:18:13,401 --> 00:18:23,161
If a person lacks this concentration, his soul is concentration, this focus, his soul is disintegrated, and so forth and so forth.

180
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:24,680
And he's like a capitalist.

181
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,881
This is the shampoo part.

182
00:18:25,881 --> 00:18:30,440
He will act prudently in life like those capitalists who invest their capital in every kind of security.

183
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,921
So they gain on the one where they lose on the other.

184
00:18:32,921 --> 00:18:35,240
In short, he's not a knight.

185
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,720
Okay?

186
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,881
But I want to fix the translation here.

187
00:18:37,881 --> 00:18:38,840
You've got to have enough.

188
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:40,761
I'll remind you where we are.

189
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:47,720
I know it's sort of confusing, but it's bad to say concentrates the whole meaning of his life into a single wish.

190
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,641
Wish is the wrong word.

191
00:18:49,801 --> 00:18:51,321
Do you get the feel for that?

192
00:18:51,321 --> 00:18:56,040
Did Martin Luther King sit around wishing that things would go well for the black people?

193
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,760
If somebody's committed to somebody, do they wish that the other person doesn't leave them?

194
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,841
And no, that's wrong.

195
00:19:03,161 --> 00:19:06,520
It's too wishy-washy, if you would.

196
00:19:07,161 --> 00:19:15,561
It means they concentrate the whole of their life and meaning of reality into a single commitment.

197
00:19:15,561 --> 00:19:17,161
That's what we've been calling it.

198
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:19,241
But that's not, of course, that's me.

199
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,761
But what does the Norwegian say?

200
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:27,960
Well, another translation, Danish say, another translation says, heart's desire.

201
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,161
Now that's fine.

202
00:19:29,161 --> 00:19:38,200
That's a kind of romantic way of talking about this unconditional commitment that fits in with the kind of vocabulary he's using.

203
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,641
It doesn't sound like just sitting around doing nothing.

204
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:46,840
Martin Luther King had it certainly his heart's desire that there would be equality for the black.

205
00:19:46,841 --> 00:19:50,361
So that's a lot stronger, I hear it, than a witch.

206
00:19:50,361 --> 00:19:52,641
Okay, having fixed that, let's go on.

207
00:19:54,561 --> 00:20:01,361
So if they lack this, then they are just dispersed, and that's and they are a lower nature.

208
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:05,520
Let's just put that in, because lower nature is the same as lower immediacy.

209
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,401
He uses them interchangeably.

210
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,680
Where is it?

211
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,280
Ah, here we are.

212
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:21,680
About in the next, in the first full paragraph, that is way below the middle, about six lines in that paragraph.

213
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,760
Only lower natures forget themselves and become something new.

214
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,520
Thus, the butterfly has altogether forgotten it was a caterpillar.

215
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:35,760
Perhaps it can so completely forget and turn that it was a butterfly that it becomes a fish.

216
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:42,560
Deeper natures never forget themselves and become something else, of course, because they get an identity.

217
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:57,440
But these people will be like lower organisms as far as the way they live their lives, from going from this job to that, and this person to that, and so forth.

218
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,881
And they aren't knights at all.

219
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:13,601
Knights, all the kinds of knights that we're going to talk about, have to have an unconditional commitment, and they're different kinds of knights because they deal with their unconditional commitment in different ways.

220
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:34,720
So, but even if you're not a lower nature, you can deal with your unconditional commitment now, it turns out, in ways that make it safe, but undermine its finite temporal meaning.

221
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,281
Those are interesting ways.

222
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:51,881
These are defenses, but not just your defense or mine, but the whole history of the West not only invented unconditional commitment, but it invented interesting ways of life to avoid the consequences of unconditional commitment.

223
00:21:51,881 --> 00:21:57,320
And the first kind I want to talk about is the Greek philosopher.

224
00:21:57,321 --> 00:22:00,361
The Greek, I think, he doesn't say much about that.

225
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:02,360
He doesn't care much about that.

226
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:18,841
But I think the philosopher has, I'm going to read this, and so it's about a knight, but it's about a knight that doesn't stay a night, I think, because now let's read it.

227
00:22:18,841 --> 00:22:21,161
So the knight makes the movement, but what movement?

228
00:22:21,161 --> 00:22:23,401
Does he want to forget the whole thing?

229
00:22:23,401 --> 00:22:26,360
Because in that, too, there's a kind of concentration.

230
00:22:26,361 --> 00:22:29,081
No, the knight does not contradict himself.

231
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,521
Oh, I misspoke.

232
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,560
Kierkegaard's right.

233
00:22:31,561 --> 00:22:34,680
I was just innovating an explanation.

234
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,280
The point is, this paragraph is not about the knight.

235
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,600
The knight really does do the right thing, but it's a second sentence now.

236
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:46,360
This is what philosophers do: they forget the whole thing.

237
00:22:46,361 --> 00:22:49,321
And what it means to forget the whole thing, I want to tell you now.

238
00:22:49,881 --> 00:22:53,080
I doubt very many of you read Plato's Symposium.

239
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:55,081
Oh, more than I realized.

240
00:22:55,081 --> 00:22:58,921
Okay, Plato wrote a dialogue called the Symposium.

241
00:22:59,561 --> 00:23:01,320
Try to write that.

242
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:11,801
And in the Symposium, he talks about, I've mentioned it before, I realize now, but I never wrote it on the board, I don't think, did I?

243
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,720
Thanks.

244
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,520
It's a dialogue about love.

245
00:23:20,641 --> 00:23:35,841
And it's a dialogue that, I did mention it in connection with the joke in it from Aristophanes: that people were around once, and they're now chopped in two, and the two halves are going around looking for each other, and they've only got one other half.

246
00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:39,601
When they find it, they hold on to each other and feel happiest they could ever feel.

247
00:23:39,601 --> 00:23:42,960
And when they haven't found it, they're feeling very unhappy and lonely.

248
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,200
And Aristophanes thinks that's a joke.

249
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,601
But that's just a description of romantic love.

250
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:54,080
That just shows the big difference between the world of Plato and Aristophanes and Kierkegaard.

251
00:23:54,081 --> 00:24:04,320
But what happens instead of the joke when Socrates tells Plato's, or Plato through Socrates, tells his story.

252
00:24:04,321 --> 00:24:13,520
It's the story I mentioned that you love one beautiful body, then you go on and love many, and then you love one beautiful soul, and then you love many, and then you love the beautiful.

253
00:24:13,841 --> 00:24:19,520
What I want to say about it this time is slightly different than what I said last time, though, not contradicting it.

254
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:25,121
What's interesting is, how do you feel about the one beautiful body and the one beautiful soul you love once?

255
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:31,680
And so let's go just for fun put them together in this nice super person who's got a beautiful body and a beautiful soul.

256
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,601
Well, you forget them.

257
00:24:33,601 --> 00:24:35,280
They are petty things.

258
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:38,720
What the translation I was reading says.

259
00:24:39,601 --> 00:24:42,881
Or I forget, there's another translation I wrote down here.

260
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,240
What did I say?

261
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,600
Of no account.

262
00:24:45,921 --> 00:24:47,520
There's another translation.

263
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:56,080
That is, it turns out that there was never anything significant about their relationship to the beautiful, whatever.

264
00:24:56,081 --> 00:25:00,481
You just realize that the beautiful, whatever, was not what you really were looking for.

265
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,480
You were looking for the beautiful.

266
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,921
And so you forget the whole thing.

267
00:25:07,081 --> 00:25:10,680
And but what's interesting is it requires a kind of concentration.

268
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:26,040
I mean, he thinks that that's a kind of mediation, and mediation is already a kind of achievement over just lower immediacy where you go after some particular body or soul and just get fixated on it and stop there.

269
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:33,000
But the achievement, the concentration, consists in, so to speak, dumping the individual altogether.

270
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,121
Okay, that's the first one.

271
00:25:34,121 --> 00:25:38,041
We don't want to spend much time on it because it's not the one that he's interested in.

272
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:41,000
There's another one next because he says there are three.

273
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,200
And another one we're not going to talk about right now, which is the tragic hero.

274
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,841
We'll get to the tragic hero three lines, three down.

275
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,200
I just, it's too complicated, and we don't need it.

276
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,720
The next one is what interests me a lot, Christian philosophy.

277
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,720
Because in a way, that's a contradiction in terms, the way I've said it up.

278
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,520
Christian philosophy, they're supposed to not go together.

279
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,840
And of course, they don't go together well.

280
00:26:08,841 --> 00:26:11,721
And my example already, you've heard me talk about St.

281
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,280
Augustine.

282
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:12,440
St.

283
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:19,800
Augustine takes the Judeo-Christian world and maps it onto Plato.

284
00:26:19,801 --> 00:26:29,161
And it doesn't work very well, I said, but I said it about the creation and about how he couldn't explain why the world was good and he couldn't explain God-man.

285
00:26:29,161 --> 00:26:32,601
But now I'm going to tell it how he views love.

286
00:26:32,601 --> 00:26:35,161
He's very interesting on love.

287
00:26:36,841 --> 00:26:39,161
And it's a perfect let what happens.

288
00:26:39,161 --> 00:26:44,280
It's a beautiful example of what happens if you try to graph together Plato and Christianity.

289
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,760
So I'm going to read you just a few things from Augustine's Confessions.

290
00:26:49,720 --> 00:27:06,480
So what happens is, I don't tell you what pages, but you're not going to be reading this translation, probably.

291
00:27:06,801 --> 00:27:34,561
Okay, it's by somebody whose name you can't forget, a guy named Pine Coffin, who was, and so now I'm going to read from this Pine Coffin translation just what Augustine says about what was clearly what would look like an unconditional commitment to a friend who he's talking about the love of the friend and the friend dies.

292
00:27:34,561 --> 00:27:36,960
So we'll find out what happens there.

293
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:43,041
So he talks about ours was not a friendship between friends and so forth.

294
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:48,721
There was a sweetness in our friendship mellowed by the interests we shared.

295
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,040
I'm not reading what I want to read.

296
00:27:54,801 --> 00:28:08,560
Yet in a moment before we had reached the end of the first year of friendship that was sweeter to me than all the joys of life as I lived them, that sort of world-class commitment, you took him from this world.

297
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,560
The friend died.

298
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,480
And he describes how they never left each other's sides.

299
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,200
They were so deeply involved with each other.

300
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:29,600
And when the friend died, because they were so deeply involved with each other, he says, My heart grew somber with grief, and wherever I looked, I saw only death.

301
00:28:29,601 --> 00:28:35,000
So he's got a really good description of commitment, and there's more about it, but I don't want to read it all.

302
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,801
Really nice things he says about how close they were to each other.

303
00:28:40,361 --> 00:28:47,881
Well, he wondered, I wondered that other men should live when he was dead, for I had loved him as though he would never die.

304
00:28:47,881 --> 00:28:54,520
I wondered that he should die, and I remain alive, for I was his second self, and so forth.

305
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:59,000
I felt that our two souls had been as one, living in two bodies.

306
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:06,760
So it's really, Augustine is a Christian, and he's got these Christian feelings that no Greek could have.

307
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:17,480
I mean, look how different that is than you just forget the beautiful soul and the beautiful body that you've been attached to, and just because they're really not important.

308
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,200
The friend was terribly important, and he describes beautifully how important.

309
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,080
But then, what happens with Augustine?

310
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:31,480
Well, what conclusion does he draw from the fact that this friend has been taken away?

311
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:46,440
He says, the well-loved man who just a second.

312
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,320
We're talking about somebody else here, but it doesn't matter.

313
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:56,361
The part I want to read is, tears alone were sweet to me, for in my heart's desire they had taken the place of my friend.

314
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:01,641
That's all just, but now I'm ready for the conclusion that he wants to draw about it.

315
00:30:01,641 --> 00:30:08,440
And he concludes from it that, boy, do I have trouble finding?

316
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,281
I can't believe my own page numbers.

317
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,321
There we go.

318
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,040
He concludes, what madness to love a man is something more than human?

319
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,081
What folly to grumble the lot of man has to bear?

320
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:25,680
Well, you see what's beginning to happen?

321
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:34,081
He's beginning to say, there must have been something wrong that I put all my love into that relationship with somebody who was vulnerable.

322
00:30:34,081 --> 00:30:36,161
That's crazy, he says.

323
00:30:36,161 --> 00:30:38,320
So, what's the moral of all that?

324
00:30:38,321 --> 00:30:40,801
Well, the moral of it is that he shouldn't have.

325
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:49,280
You should never build your life so that you go into total grief, get so close to somebody that they seem to be the other half of you, and so forth.

326
00:30:49,280 --> 00:31:05,680
He says, For the grief I felt for the loss of my friend had struck so easily into my inmost heart simply because I had poured out my soul upon him like water upon sand, loving a man who was mortal as though he would never die.

327
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,641
That's the problem, all right.

328
00:31:08,641 --> 00:31:10,161
And what's the solution?

329
00:31:10,161 --> 00:31:19,040
Well, he says, Blessed are those who love you, O God, and love their friends in you for your sake.

330
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:25,361
They alone will never lose those who are dear to them, for they love them in one who has never lost God.

331
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:31,121
Now, he never explains what it is to love your friend in God.

332
00:31:31,121 --> 00:31:37,841
But the liking thing about the confessions, now we see him switching over to sort of Plato.

333
00:31:37,841 --> 00:31:46,401
You give up the vulnerable love for the love of God, who is secure and presumably eternal, and so forth.

334
00:31:46,561 --> 00:31:49,360
The question is: do you remember the friend?

335
00:31:49,361 --> 00:31:53,361
Well, in Plato, it's clear you don't remember the beautiful body and the beautiful soul.

336
00:31:53,361 --> 00:31:54,641
They don't even have names.

337
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,841
Well, this friend doesn't have a name either for that.

338
00:31:56,841 --> 00:31:57,921
So forget that.

339
00:31:57,921 --> 00:32:04,881
But anyway, the friend, you, Augustine says you love him forever in God.

340
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,480
You just don't love him in a temporal, finite way.

341
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,360
And he never mentions him again in the whole book.

342
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:23,960
So it really turns out that when you love him in God, he gets sort of subsumed into the beautiful and the good and the eternal and doesn't, and his individuality just gets wiped out.

343
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,280
And the significance of that relation gets wiped out.

344
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,401
And that's what I was saying.

345
00:32:31,401 --> 00:32:34,761
That's what happens when you try to put Plato together with Christianity.

346
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,881
I mean, he comes as, Augustine comes as close as he can.

347
00:32:37,881 --> 00:32:41,240
He has the whole unconditional commitment experience.

348
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:47,640
And then he puts it in what look like Christian terms, something about God and love.

349
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:53,241
But it turns out really in Plato terms because what happens to the friend is he's just gone.

350
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:56,281
So what else could you have?

351
00:32:56,281 --> 00:33:01,081
Well, we can finally get to real nights of resignation.

352
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:07,960
Augustine, I don't think, counts as a night of resignation because he isn't holding on to that.

353
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,120
Well, I don't know, he's a marginal case.

354
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:18,761
He's holding on to the memory enough to write about it for five pages, but he's not holding on to it in the sense that it makes any difference for the rest of his life.

355
00:33:18,761 --> 00:33:22,760
So I don't know, call him a night of resignation, call him an honorite night of resignation.

356
00:33:22,761 --> 00:33:34,921
I think he's not a night of resignation because he never thinks, I, well, you really don't know what to think because he never says, well, I'd be, who I am is the lover of this friend.

357
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:42,601
But he does say, you know, we were so close to each other that we couldn't be separated, and we can't imagine what we would be apart.

358
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,401
And he does go into grief, weird grief, when the friend dies.

359
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:52,640
So I guess he had an unconditional commitment and then betrayed it, from a Kierkegaard point of view.

360
00:33:53,120 --> 00:34:04,080
That is, he used the concentration he had in a philosophical way, namely the concentration to finally annihilate it, give it up.

361
00:34:04,721 --> 00:34:23,600
The difference is clearer if you just skip from the set to the second kind of Christian philosophy, which instead of trying to get Plato together with this Christian, Judeo-Christian commitment experience, you end up trying to get Aristotle together.

362
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,281
Then you get Dante.

363
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:26,560
When St.

364
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:34,960
Thomas in 1300, roughly, puts Christianity into Aristotelian terms, Dante comes along and writes about Beatrice.

365
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,121
And he never forgets Beatrice.

366
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:41,280
The whole meaning of his life is to be the lover of Beatrice.

367
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,720
That's his lady.

368
00:34:42,721 --> 00:34:44,081
That's who he is.

369
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:48,480
And he says he's going to write a poem about her like nobody ever wrote before.

370
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,240
And I forget, did I tell you already?

371
00:34:50,241 --> 00:34:56,161
I get so confused because I tell different people different things in office hours about what he does with Beatrice?

372
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,520
I don't think so.

373
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,880
I'll try to tell you fast.

374
00:34:58,881 --> 00:35:06,560
In the divine comedy, they get up to the, I didn't tell you this, they get up to the top of purgatory, and the procession of the books of the Bible go by.

375
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,601
Didn't say that.

376
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:20,960
Okay, and the whole Old Testament goes by, and then it comes to a stop, and it's pulling a chariot, and in the chariot, there's some figure covered up, and the angels fly over the chariot and say, Blessed is he who comes.

377
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,800
And what can be there?

378
00:35:22,801 --> 00:35:27,761
What would be the thing that followed the Old Testament if it had angels and so forth?

379
00:35:27,761 --> 00:35:28,880
It should be Jesus.

380
00:35:28,881 --> 00:35:31,761
I mean, that's what you're getting is the history of the church.

381
00:35:31,761 --> 00:35:33,521
And guess who's in the chariot?

382
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,801
Beatrice.

383
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:39,800
Beatrice is his Savior and therefore his God person.

384
00:35:35,681 --> 00:35:41,560
And he's never going to forget her.

385
00:35:41,801 --> 00:35:43,480
He's writing this whole poem about her.

386
00:35:43,721 --> 00:35:48,121
Well, then, why isn't he doing it right?

387
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:52,041
Well, the reason he's not doing it right is he's still got this Greek element.

388
00:35:52,040 --> 00:36:04,120
At the end of the whole book, having re-seen Beatrice and having looked at Beatrice's legs and felt the same old hot flames, which is really interesting.

389
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:11,241
I mean, the body is important to Aristotle in a way to Dante that Augustine was trying to deny.

390
00:36:11,241 --> 00:36:15,161
But she finally says, you couldn't have cared about my body when I died.

391
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:19,161
You should only have cared about my beautiful soul, and you can see what's happening.

392
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:28,921
And when they finally get to the end of the poem, she goes back to looking at God, and he goes to looking at God, and they stop looking at each other.

393
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:37,641
Oh, he's going from legs to smile to eyes, and he's looking into her eyes, and he sees Jesus reflected in her eyes because she really is Jesus for him.

394
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:45,960
And then at the last lines of the poem are, and my love became one with the will that moved the sun and the other stars.

395
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,040
That's universal.

396
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,121
That's Aristotle's prime mover.

397
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,480
The love as unconditional commitment is just gone.

398
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,721
And so that didn't work either.

399
00:36:56,281 --> 00:37:03,161
That's the best you can do trying to combine Christianity and philosophy and make any sense out of this experience.

400
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,440
So what do you do?

401
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:11,960
Well, you've got to go into another move, with the move against the important move to us, but I think it's good to have a running start.

402
00:37:12,281 --> 00:37:22,241
Is there any way then to make a defining commitment to an individual safe from the vulnerability and risk?

403
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,801
We just seen you could protect yourself against getting it.

404
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:30,081
You could seem to have it and then deny it.

405
00:37:31,201 --> 00:37:32,161
Or what?

406
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,161
Well, that's the interesting one.

407
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,960
The knight of resignation has a way of staying in the defining relation.

408
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,520
Never deny the crucial importance of the other person.

409
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,841
Let's do it in terms of romantic love.

410
00:37:47,841 --> 00:37:50,640
And yet convert it into something safe.

411
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,321
How could you do this?

412
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,480
Well, what would it be like?

413
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,361
Remember, now we're talking about the deeper natures.

414
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:00,720
They never forget themselves.

415
00:38:00,721 --> 00:38:03,361
I wear a page with 72.

416
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:05,600
So here's...

417
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,561
Whoop.

418
00:38:07,681 --> 00:38:09,200
I just did something.

419
00:38:09,281 --> 00:38:10,561
We have to step out.

420
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,041
Now what am I going to do?

421
00:38:14,801 --> 00:38:16,560
Well, don't lose your wits.

422
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:29,841
I got one more thing to read about Dante before I get to Beatrice, before I get to our way of doing it, because there's the perfect description of this Dante thing that I want you to realize I didn't make it up.

423
00:38:29,921 --> 00:38:31,841
The bottom of 72.

424
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,480
Deeper natures never forget themselves and never become something other than they were.

425
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,160
So the knight will remember everything.

426
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,281
This is Dante.

427
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:45,281
But the memory is precisely the pain, and yet in his infinite resignation, he's reconciled with existence.

428
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,800
Now comes the Dante move.

429
00:38:46,801 --> 00:39:06,601
His love for the princess would take on for him the expression of an eternal love, would acquire a religious character, be transfigured into a love for the eternal being, which, although it denied fulfillment, still reconciled him once more in the eternal consciousness of his love's validity in an eternal form that no reality could take from it.

430
00:39:05,841 --> 00:39:11,240
See, that's just a complex, condensed description of what Dante did with Beatrice.

431
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:17,401
He saved the part of the relation to Beatrice, which was the.

432
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,881
What was the real significance of it?

433
00:39:19,881 --> 00:39:25,881
Well, the real significance of it was that she was the way that led him to this experience of God.

434
00:39:26,201 --> 00:39:30,520
And that made her so important that she's his Savior and so forth.

435
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,240
He did that.

436
00:39:31,241 --> 00:39:45,801
Now, could there be, and we showed, not only did we do it, but you see, if he turns it into an eternal love transfigured so that it's, let me read a little further.

437
00:39:46,600 --> 00:40:04,201
It turns into love of the eternal being, that God, although it denied fulfillment, in the bottom of 72, still reconciled him once more in the eternal consciousness of his love's validity in an eternal form that no reality could take from him.

438
00:40:05,801 --> 00:40:13,321
He remembered the love of Beatrice and wrote about it for the rest of his life.

439
00:40:13,321 --> 00:40:16,600
What could be even better?

440
00:40:16,921 --> 00:40:30,280
Well, it's what you could do or I could do, or we'll see people doing it, but I don't want to tell you who for reasons that should be obvious.

441
00:40:30,281 --> 00:40:39,561
But anyway, it's what it's what it's don't transfigure it into an eternal universal love of God.

442
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:56,401
Just stick to the relationship and discover that what's important about the relationship isn't the physical, finite, temporal part of it.

443
00:40:56,401 --> 00:41:02,801
It's the significance of the relationship.

444
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:10,081
So and the significance of the relationship, that's the modern thing.

445
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:25,041
You idealize the relationship and you say what was important about it was that I could know that person and they could know me and we could have this relationship that is so full of meaning that whether they're there or not doesn't matter.

446
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,681
The meaning is preserved.

447
00:41:27,681 --> 00:41:29,280
That should sound familiar.

448
00:41:29,281 --> 00:41:31,601
There are several movies like that.

449
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:37,761
But unfortunately, my TA said I should give you a list of movies that you could see, like a recommended reading.

450
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:40,160
And you can take them out of Next List or whatever.

451
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,640
The movie that shows this very well is a movie called A Man and a Woman.

452
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,161
Anybody ever seen that?

453
00:41:46,801 --> 00:41:47,600
A few people.

454
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,960
It's a good movie.

455
00:41:48,960 --> 00:42:00,160
And it's a story about a woman who was in love with a stunt man, a movie stunt man, who got killed, I forget how, in some kind of accident of the set, I suppose.

456
00:42:00,401 --> 00:42:12,801
And we, but her experience with him was so vivid and important that she just continually keeps it fresh in her mind and remembers it over and over.

457
00:42:12,801 --> 00:42:21,281
And there's this very important scene, I think, in there for what's really going on in the movie is she's finally got interested in another man a little bit, and he's interested in her.

458
00:42:21,281 --> 00:42:25,361
And they're together in a hotel room in bed, I think.

459
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,520
I don't remember clearly, but I think so.

460
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,001
Anyway, and it's dimly lit in the room.

461
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:49,561
And what's happening is she's trying to relate to him, but what she keeps getting on the screen are these bright flashes of making love in a sleeping bag in the snow with her stuntman, first lover, which are so vivid and so important that they keep her from paying any attention to the man she's with.

462
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,881
And that's exactly what the night of resignation does.

463
00:42:53,881 --> 00:43:06,041
The night of resignation can manage to make their one first crucial love so vivid and so important that they don't need to keep the other person around.

464
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:10,440
They don't even want to keep the other person around, because that would make them vulnerable.

465
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:15,161
But all of the significance they can keep, because that's solid.

466
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,281
So let me tell you, let's read Kierkegaard on it now.

467
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:29,000
I call this the movement of resignation to idealize this love, the love affair that you have, and to internalize it.

468
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,201
That is, take it into yourself as a memory.

469
00:43:32,201 --> 00:43:38,921
Kierkegaard talks about it on 74, on the first full paragraph.

470
00:43:38,921 --> 00:43:42,121
In infinite resignation, there is peace and repose.

471
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:54,041
Anyone who wants it, who has not debased himself, and so forth, can discipline himself to make this movement, which in its pain reconciles one with existence.

472
00:43:54,681 --> 00:43:58,680
And that's now what we want to hear more about.

473
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,680
And it's pain.

474
00:44:00,681 --> 00:44:02,361
Why is it pain?

475
00:44:02,361 --> 00:44:06,521
Well, because you lack the presence of the other person.

476
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:11,801
And that's you feel you feel lonely, and you feel you're really missing something.

477
00:44:11,801 --> 00:44:18,921
However, it's joyful too, because the significance is preserved and it's safe.

478
00:44:18,921 --> 00:44:23,601
This he says on 78, the end of the middle paragraph.

479
00:44:24,241 --> 00:44:31,761
But by my own strength, let's see, I'm continually using my energy to renounce everything.

480
00:44:31,761 --> 00:44:40,001
By my own strength, I can give up the princess, and I'll be no sulker, but find joy and peace and repose in my pain.

481
00:44:40,321 --> 00:44:42,881
But with my own strength, I can't get her back.

482
00:44:42,881 --> 00:44:47,520
For all that strength is precisely what I use to renounce my claim on her.

483
00:44:47,520 --> 00:45:03,521
All that is to say, you're sad because you've missed the person, but you're joyful because you did have this relationship and it's still vivid, but you can't have it be safe and get her back.

484
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:18,321
So you settle for the fact that you have repose, meaning, and a certain minimal kind of joy, but it's not altogether joy.

485
00:45:19,681 --> 00:45:24,001
You find joy in the pain of resignation, as he puts it on 79.

486
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:35,440
Every moment to see the sword hanging over the loved one's head, and yet find not repose in the pain of resignation, but, and down we go to the night of faith, which we're not ready to go to.

487
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,320
So I won't read the rest of this paragraph yet.

488
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,881
And he says now, and it turns out to be important, I guess.

489
00:45:42,881 --> 00:45:49,761
I don't know why, because the examples are usually what people do after they lose their loved one.

490
00:45:49,761 --> 00:45:54,000
But, well, maybe Kierkegaard's saying this is, no, I don't.

491
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,440
Is this related to Regina?

492
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,161
Let me go.

493
00:45:57,681 --> 00:45:58,321
No.

494
00:45:58,321 --> 00:46:14,520
No, he says that if you've got enough imagination, you can see that the relation is, the ship is vulnerable, and you should immediately make this movement of resignation and only relate to the significance of the other person right away, and so you won't be hurt.

495
00:46:14,841 --> 00:46:26,281
Because if you don't do that, then when they die, you'll be very much sort of plunged into grief and confusion and so forth, and you may not be able to make the movement right.

496
00:46:26,281 --> 00:46:30,040
And in fact, I think that's what happened to Kierkegaard when he broke his Regina.

497
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:36,121
He just never got it together to figure out whether he was a knight of resignation or nothing or nothing at all.

498
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:43,800
But so, anyway, so he says that you should make the movement before it's too late.

499
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,721
Where's the way that's that?

500
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:57,641
Yeah, the bottom of 74.

501
00:46:58,361 --> 00:47:07,401
It talks about it's precisely spirit that is needed, that is real strength of emotion, that is needed to make this movement.

502
00:47:07,401 --> 00:47:12,601
What matters is it's not being one-sided results of dire necessity.

503
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:16,761
The more it is that, the more doubtful it is that it's a proper movement.

504
00:47:16,761 --> 00:47:27,881
That is, if you're reconciling yourself to the loss of the other person once they're lost, it's not nearly as sure that you're doing the right thing, namely the right thing meaning perhaps a resignation person.

505
00:47:29,321 --> 00:47:33,640
But you're not being a good knight of resignation if you wait until you have to do it.

506
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:41,641
You ought to see, if you're a knight of resignation, that the significance is all that matters, and just do it right away.

507
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:46,121
So, the good side, now I'm going to do the good side and the downside.

508
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,200
The good side, I'm going to let you all talk.

509
00:47:48,201 --> 00:47:49,000
I've got feelings.

510
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,361
Anybody want to say anything?

511
00:47:50,361 --> 00:47:53,121
I've been talking to you.

512
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,001
Anybody?

513
00:47:50,761 --> 00:47:54,240
Yeah.

514
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,841
It looks like not.

515
00:48:01,841 --> 00:48:07,841
Well, yes, give it, yeah, take it, because I can hear you, but they remember the podcast all over the world.

516
00:48:07,841 --> 00:48:08,480
Okay.

517
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:18,240
So, meanwhile, then damn it, so the Knight of Resignation, meanwhile, is still absolutely committed to the significance of this memory of his.

518
00:48:18,241 --> 00:48:19,201
Is that so?

519
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:28,881
Okay, and this is a little bit of an aside, but could you clarify exactly what was so Aristotelian about what Dante had to say?

520
00:48:30,321 --> 00:48:35,841
Okay, not much, because it's so much inside of Aristotle.

521
00:48:35,841 --> 00:48:41,280
But for Aristotle, I did mention what God is called the unmoved mover.

522
00:48:41,281 --> 00:48:47,760
And God is this sort of force outside the universe that everything is tending toward.

523
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:55,360
And that's what Dante is talking about when he says, My will became one with the will that moved the sun and the other stars.

524
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:03,281
He pictured this sort of the whole world as a kind of wheel and turning, and God is turning it, and Dante gets turning too.

525
00:49:03,281 --> 00:49:11,440
It's all so metaphorical because no one knows what it means that you have this mystical experience that Dante had.

526
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:14,161
Okay, anything else?

527
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:14,721
Yeah.

528
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:23,280
Yeah, what happens if you're not going to mean what happens if you want to understand what you have to die?

529
00:49:24,881 --> 00:49:25,681
Yeah.

530
00:49:26,321 --> 00:49:29,200
Oh, no, that's a very, very basic question.

531
00:49:29,201 --> 00:49:34,641
She's asking what happens to your unconditional commitment or to your identity when the other person dies.

532
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:39,641
The answer is: if you're a knight of resignation, nothing.

533
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:42,361
You keep your identity just as you had it.

534
00:49:42,681 --> 00:49:46,760
So Dante stays the lover of Beatrice, and Beatrice dies.

535
00:49:46,761 --> 00:49:47,960
She dies young.

536
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:54,120
Anyway, and Dante marries somebody else and has kids, but that doesn't matter.

537
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:59,241
He always understands himself as the lover of his lady Beatrice.

538
00:49:59,241 --> 00:50:03,161
So that's the trick in them that the resignation people pull off.

539
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:08,841
They manage to have an identity, and it stays, and it stays eternal.

540
00:50:08,841 --> 00:50:10,520
That is, you remember the forever.

541
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:16,841
It's forever what's important in their life from the beginning where it's absent to the end, where it guides everything they do.

542
00:50:16,841 --> 00:50:18,281
They've got all that.

543
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:21,881
What they haven't got is it's it.

544
00:50:22,201 --> 00:50:23,401
I said something wrong.

545
00:50:23,401 --> 00:50:25,160
It doesn't guide everything they do.

546
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:25,881
Take that back.

547
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,480
It's there.

548
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,001
It's important to them.

549
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,321
It's their identity.

550
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:32,841
Wow.

551
00:50:32,841 --> 00:50:34,921
But it guides everything Dante does.

552
00:50:34,921 --> 00:50:36,521
Let me think about it.

553
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,681
He doesn't have Beatrice anymore.

554
00:50:46,681 --> 00:50:49,241
That should be something he worries about.

555
00:50:49,241 --> 00:50:51,881
Beatrice says he shouldn't have worried about it when she died.

556
00:50:51,881 --> 00:50:54,201
He should have thought just that was fine.

557
00:50:54,201 --> 00:50:57,241
And it's fine in the sense that he keeps his identity.

558
00:50:57,241 --> 00:51:04,681
What's bothering me is: does he know day by day, finitely and temporal, what's to do?

559
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,480
Yeah, right about Beatrice.

560
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,801
But what doesn't he know?

561
00:51:09,801 --> 00:51:13,241
He doesn't know that there's anything worth sacrificing for.

562
00:51:13,241 --> 00:51:20,201
He's logging because Beatrice is dead, and it's all secure, that his identity is preserved.

563
00:51:20,241 --> 00:51:27,921
And the high-powered kind of meaning that you get if you have to day by day support the cause.

564
00:51:27,921 --> 00:51:28,480
I think that's it.

565
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:35,761
Martin Luther King can't sit back and say, well, I know what I'm supposed to do today, and he does it.

566
00:51:35,761 --> 00:51:40,881
But it isn't as if if he failed to do it, the whole thing would crash and the meaning would go out of his life.

567
00:51:40,881 --> 00:51:45,040
It doesn't have that kind of vulnerability and that kind of grip.

568
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,561
And I think that's the point.

569
00:51:46,560 --> 00:52:00,401
So you have to picture Dante writing about Beatrice, caring about Beatrice, understanding himself in terms of Beatrice, but it isn't as if he thinks that his relation to Beatrice could call on him to make some kind of sacrifice.

570
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,881
It's not that immediate.

571
00:52:02,881 --> 00:52:09,680
It's not that intense because if the relationship is secure, there's no, what would you do to sacrifice for it?

572
00:52:09,681 --> 00:52:11,040
I mean, he's got it.

573
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,881
She's in heaven.

574
00:52:12,881 --> 00:52:17,361
He's attached to her and knows that she is.

575
00:52:17,361 --> 00:52:19,600
So I think I just have to say something like that.

576
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:31,681
Remember way back at the beginning, must seem years ago of this lecture, I said that we're talking about what gives you the highest kind of meaning that a human being can have.

577
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:44,081
And part of that is that what you are committed to is dependent on your commitment, such that you have to be ready to sacrifice yourself for it.

578
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,161
And that's what he hasn't got.

579
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,160
But what he has got is an identity.

580
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,081
He keeps his identity.

581
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,320
But what you've got to keep this as subtle.

582
00:52:52,321 --> 00:53:01,761
He keeps his identity, but the finite and temporal world does not have the highest meaning for him that it could have if she were there.

583
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:10,841
And her being there was tied up with him having to constantly sort of affirm in his actions toward her that she was his savior.

584
00:53:05,761 --> 00:53:13,080
Oh, and being ready to die if need be.

585
00:53:13,241 --> 00:53:13,800
Yeah.

586
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,760
Ah, that's a very good question.

587
00:53:18,761 --> 00:53:24,520
How is the knight of resignation not an obsessive fanatic?

588
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:25,960
Look at your chart.

589
00:53:26,281 --> 00:53:28,841
I'd forgotten all about the trouble of getting out this chart.

590
00:53:28,841 --> 00:53:29,721
Where are we?

591
00:53:29,721 --> 00:53:30,280
Okay.

592
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:38,121
You're at a part of the chart which is at the bottom and doesn't isn't, but we need to go through it.

593
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:50,281
It's that the lower natures, looking at the top chart, that's the only one we're going to talk about today, have to go through the ethical, universal, that is, mediation.

594
00:53:50,281 --> 00:53:54,520
Remember, the lower natures are the lower immediacy.

595
00:53:54,841 --> 00:54:05,561
They are the ones who are fanatical, fanciful, driven, and everything like that.

596
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,440
My favorite example, it's always in movies.

597
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,480
How many have seen this wonderful movie, M with Peter Laurie?

598
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,921
Anybody ever seen that?

599
00:54:13,241 --> 00:54:25,721
Peter Laurie is in lower immediacy, all right, when he kills young girls, the guy he plays, and he is driven to do it.

600
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:30,681
And he can't resist, and he tries when he sees some attractive little girl.

601
00:54:30,681 --> 00:54:37,561
He goes to a cafe, he drinks cognac, he tries to read something or think about something else that he eventually kills her.

602
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:44,361
And he in the in the movie, he's explaining how terrible it is to be driven like that.

603
00:54:44,361 --> 00:54:49,240
And now the idea is anybody has the strength, according to Kierkegaard, I think.

604
00:54:49,241 --> 00:54:51,281
I don't know what Kierkegaard would think about.

605
00:54:50,681 --> 00:54:52,321
This parachute.

606
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:58,960
But I mean, supposedly, if you have enough critical ability, you can therapize yourself out of it.

607
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,960
Or if you can't, you can go to a therapist who can help, you know, mediate you out of it.

608
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:14,321
So it's only after you've been mediated out of all your obsessions and any ways that you're driven that you can make an unconditional commitment.

609
00:55:14,321 --> 00:55:16,401
Otherwise, you're absolutely right.

610
00:55:16,401 --> 00:55:18,160
It would just be fanatical.

611
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,120
Now, there's another movie.

612
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,401
I'm going to give you a list of the nights.

613
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:35,600
If anybody can help me remember, when you write down all the movies I'm talking about, we talked to T.A.'s and I about the movie Adele H, which is a beautiful example of life, even better than M, really, because it's a case of romantic love gone wacky.

614
00:55:35,921 --> 00:55:41,361
She is overly obsessed with some one particular man who's in the army.

615
00:55:41,361 --> 00:55:45,601
And the whole movie is about what this obsession does to him and to her.

616
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,960
And it's crazy.

617
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:53,120
I mean, she has no critical sense that he doesn't care at all about her and she's just in his way and so forth.

618
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:56,721
She has the illusions that they're going to get married and so forth.

619
00:55:56,721 --> 00:55:59,520
Anyway, that won't work.

620
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:05,121
So Kierkegaard just has one general way to deal with your problem.

621
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:17,601
You can't have an unconditional commitment and distinguish it from some fanatical craziness unless you've gone through mediation and rationally criticized all of your immediate impulses.

622
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,680
Okay, that's it was very important.

623
00:56:19,681 --> 00:56:21,281
Anybody else?

624
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:22,401
Yeah.

625
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,720
I say Dante is a night of resignation.

626
00:56:38,921 --> 00:56:42,200
I know that you saw me getting all upset and confused about this.

627
00:56:42,201 --> 00:56:47,001
It's where the Aristotle and the Christianity come close together.

628
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:55,560
In the sense that he transformed his love into this universal love, I think he's not.

629
00:56:55,721 --> 00:56:57,000
Well, what's he say about it here?

630
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,120
Is he a knight or isn't he?

631
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,681
Let's read the passage that describes Dante.

632
00:57:00,921 --> 00:57:02,040
He transforms.

633
00:57:02,361 --> 00:57:05,001
Okay, we're on page 72.

634
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,521
Before I make a big speech, I want to know which side I should be on.

635
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,560
So the knight makes the movements, but what movements?

636
00:57:11,881 --> 00:57:13,321
Yes, he's a knight.

637
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,440
Well, no, no, no, no.

638
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,281
It's a contradiction if you get the whole thing.

639
00:57:16,281 --> 00:57:19,160
Only the lower natures, deeper natures never forget.

640
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,921
The knight will remember everything.

641
00:57:20,921 --> 00:57:36,761
Okay, he is a knight of resignation because even though he stops looking at Beatrice, even though he becomes one with the will that moves the sun and the other stars, he always takes this relationship as the most important thing in his life.

642
00:57:36,761 --> 00:57:37,960
It's tricky.

643
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:47,641
I would put it in the jargon of the Gospel of John that some of you will know, where the Gospel of John says that Jesus is the truth and the way.

644
00:57:47,960 --> 00:58:00,921
And I read that to be that Jesus is both the Savior and calls you to be, have an unconditional commitment to him, according to the Gospel of John.

645
00:58:00,921 --> 00:58:03,801
But it looks like what happens is that they two come across.

646
00:58:03,801 --> 00:58:08,121
Beatrice is the way, that is, she leads him to God.

647
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,560
That God is the truth, the reality.

648
00:58:11,881 --> 00:58:18,361
But because she leads him to God, she has this unconditional importance in his life.

649
00:58:18,841 --> 00:58:25,200
Even though when he gets to God, God is so important that he doesn't have to pay any attention to Beatrice anymore.

650
00:58:20,681 --> 00:58:27,600
It's such a, you're not looking happy.

651
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,281
I wish I could be clearer.

652
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:48,880
I think what this shows is that Aristotelianized Christianity gets as close to the getting it right as you can get, but doesn't because, now I'm back to struggling, because Dante has taken the vulnerability out of the situation.

653
00:58:48,881 --> 00:58:55,841
Beatrice says, you shouldn't have been upset when I died, because it was the meaning of our relationship.

654
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:00,960
But, and that's the night of resignation part.

655
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:07,361
But then, because it all has been stuffed into Aristotelian categories, he messes it up at the end.

656
00:59:07,361 --> 00:59:16,560
And instead of saying, and he remains true to Beatrice all his life, he lets the higher supreme being sort of come in and wipe out Beatrice.

657
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,040
I guess I should say, no wonder we're all confused and I'm confused.

658
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:25,921
That's what happens when you put Aristotle together with the Gospel of John.

659
00:59:25,921 --> 00:59:31,921
You're bound to get hosh, the sort of medieval stew that lasted for a thousand years.

660
00:59:31,921 --> 00:59:35,680
So, why should I be out of it when I'm trying to explain it?

661
00:59:36,241 --> 00:59:37,921
Anyway, let's.

662
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:43,841
So, he is the limiting sort of knight of resignation.

663
00:59:43,841 --> 00:59:51,521
But the true knight of resignation, who does it right and successfully, is the one we're talking about.

664
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:57,601
And now, what the night of resignation does is two things, and we've got to make sure we get to them.

665
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:12,121
Well, first, I'm going to just say, like we said, the good side of it is that it reconciles you with existence and gives you pain and joy, but takes away risk.

666
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:24,761
And now I want to say, but the downside of it is that you're never fully joyful.

667
01:00:24,761 --> 01:00:37,561
You never can experience bliss because you never get this liver-dies, super strong relation to something finite, and that's the most fulfilling thing you can get.

668
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:42,681
And you always, therefore, feel that you're missing something, I take it.

669
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,161
Where is this now?

670
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:49,720
63 at the bottom.

671
01:00:49,721 --> 01:00:50,440
I am happy.

672
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:53,320
This I, you know, who is the I that's saying I am happy?

673
01:00:53,321 --> 01:00:56,201
Let's make sure everybody's with us.

674
01:00:58,281 --> 01:01:00,120
The night of faith.

675
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:00,921
Which page?

676
01:01:00,921 --> 01:01:02,360
Oh, sorry, which page?

677
01:01:02,361 --> 01:01:04,761
63, bottom.

678
01:01:05,401 --> 01:01:07,560
So I am happy and satisfied.

679
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,721
Who's happy and satisfied?

680
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:14,440
You better know this, or I will be very unhappy.

681
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,361
Who's writing this book?

682
01:01:18,281 --> 01:01:22,040
Johannes de Salentio is writing this book, so that's odd.

683
01:01:22,361 --> 01:01:26,281
And what is Johannes de Salentio in this story we're telling?

684
01:01:26,921 --> 01:01:31,321
Is he a knight of faith, a knight of resignation, one of these lower natures?

685
01:01:34,201 --> 01:01:37,160
Well, that's not obvious, so I won't be upset that you don't know.

686
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,000
But it's certainly time I told you.

687
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,601
Johannes de Salentio is the perfect knight of resignation.

688
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,200
He can do it, he keeps saying.

689
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:55,440
I can be a resignation, I can suffer this kind of resignation and feel the bliss of it, not the bliss, sorry, the joy of it, and feel the pain of it.

690
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,440
But I can't understand the night of faith, he keeps saying.

691
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:02,160
But I can go as far as the night of resignation can go.

692
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:02,960
Let's read it.

693
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,320
I'm happy and satisfied.

694
01:02:04,321 --> 01:02:09,921
If my happiness is not that of faith, and compared with that, it is indeed unhappy.

695
01:02:11,681 --> 01:02:15,521
That's the night of resignation speaking.

696
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,480
So, what's the main thing wrong with the night?

697
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,041
Now we have to talk about that.

698
01:02:21,361 --> 01:02:39,841
The night of resignation is certainly missing the further joy of having the other person there day to day, bodily present, or the cause there day to day, demanding them and all of their energy to keep it going and to get them out.

699
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:43,521
And they're getting out of it meaning all the time.

700
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:44,801
And what's wrong?

701
01:02:44,801 --> 01:02:53,601
Well, once you've committed the movement of resignation, this is this very interesting move that Thierry Garden owns and could worry about this.

702
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:57,200
He worries about what would happen if you got the loved one back.

703
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,321
What would be your situation then?

704
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:03,760
Why is there a problem about getting the loved one back?

705
01:03:03,761 --> 01:03:05,681
Why wouldn't that just be a bonus?

706
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:09,120
You've done it, you've made it safe, and then you get the loved one back.

707
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,161
Good for you.

708
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,361
That's not how it looks.

709
01:03:11,361 --> 01:03:12,001
Yeah.

710
01:03:15,281 --> 01:03:16,480
I could be right.

711
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,881
I'd probably be right about a man and a woman.

712
01:03:18,881 --> 01:03:25,201
The stuntman is such a sappy ideal in the movies, but that she's so impressed by him.

713
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:27,440
But no, that needn't happen.

714
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,600
Let's say you have a very realistic ideal.

715
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,281
It was a terrific relationship.

716
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,640
You know that it was.

717
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:33,200
Yeah.

718
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:36,520
Ah, you got it.

719
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:37,240
You either.

720
01:03:37,241 --> 01:03:38,361
It's really an either in it.

721
01:03:38,361 --> 01:03:39,560
Does anybody have another?

722
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,680
There are two possible things.

723
01:03:35,681 --> 01:03:42,360
It's sort of like a ping-pong ball.

724
01:03:46,681 --> 01:03:48,601
You get lost because what?

725
01:03:49,241 --> 01:03:50,121
Why?

726
01:03:52,761 --> 01:03:53,720
You're on the right track.

727
01:03:53,721 --> 01:03:55,241
Let me put words in your mouth.

728
01:03:55,241 --> 01:04:00,600
Okay, you wouldn't know what to do with them as you want to say something about it?

729
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,081
What?

730
01:04:10,281 --> 01:04:12,121
Say it louder.

731
01:04:17,241 --> 01:04:18,280
No, I'm not sure.

732
01:04:18,281 --> 01:04:19,561
You have to tell me later.

733
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:22,600
But let me put words in both your mouths.

734
01:04:22,761 --> 01:04:44,841
That is, the other one possibility is what he said, that you can't help but get involved and vulnerable again if they're there and they're as attractive as ever, or else you really have succeeded in preparing for their death and making only the significance of the relationship important.

735
01:04:44,841 --> 01:04:55,000
And then you've got this klutzy person around who does all the things that people do get in your way and make a mess and have other plans than you have and so forth.

736
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:05,480
And everything they do is just a bother because it only gets in the way of the significance of the relation, which is all that matters.

737
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:11,321
So either you make the significance wholly so that you become utterly self-sufficient.

738
01:05:11,401 --> 01:05:18,041
Don't need the other person at all, in which case, what are they doing in your apartment causing all this trouble?

739
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:26,401
Or they are there, and moreover, they're so attractive, you start falling back into involvement with them, and you're all lost again.

740
01:05:20,681 --> 01:05:26,721
Yeah.

741
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:34,560
The wall in Sartre, where he thinks he can die and he lies himself to you, and he doesn't think he's like that.

742
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,520
Ah, yes, sort of.

743
01:05:37,921 --> 01:05:49,120
Is it like the wall in Sartre, where the guy thinks he's going to die the next morning and manages to go through a kind of resignation in which he doesn't care about the cause he's been fighting for?

744
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:49,520
Not quite.

745
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:50,640
No, it's too sark.

746
01:05:50,801 --> 01:05:55,521
He sort of sees the insignificance of what he was doing before.

747
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:56,480
That's different.

748
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,640
It isn't as if he sees that all that matters.

749
01:05:58,640 --> 01:05:59,840
No, just the opposite.

750
01:05:59,841 --> 01:06:01,280
Sartre is typical.

751
01:06:01,281 --> 01:06:07,681
I mean, what he sees is, when he sees he's going to die, he thinks, why was I ever concerned about that woman?

752
01:06:07,681 --> 01:06:10,561
Why was I ever ready to give my life for that cause?

753
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:19,041
And then they pardon him the next morning, but he just falls down laughing because he's seen that there's absolutely no reason why he should care and do anything.

754
01:06:19,281 --> 01:06:38,560
Whereas that's not them saying the same, because what's happening in Kierkegaard is that you have seen the completely important significance of the relation, and you've seen that you don't need, and now I'm adding, don't want the other person around, and now you get them back, what are you going to do about it?

755
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:39,201
Yeah.

756
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:49,521
Yes.

757
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:56,320
And that's why having the actual person around is either going to be a bother or it's going to get you committed to them instead of the memory.

758
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:07,400
And what's beautiful about it, Kierkegaard thinks, is if you can, just commit yourself to constantly remembering it and dwelling how great it was.

759
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,881
And then the other person is a bother.

760
01:07:05,681 --> 01:07:11,160
So let me go back to this.

761
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:22,921
So his resignation has made the temporal finite presence of the other person at least irrelevant, at most a kind of bother.

762
01:07:24,441 --> 01:07:28,280
Her presence or his presence of the loved one is not essential.

763
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:31,641
It's going to become awkward to have them around and so forth.

764
01:07:31,641 --> 01:07:33,960
Now let me see where I then go from here.

765
01:07:38,601 --> 01:07:40,841
So he would be at a loss to get him back.

766
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:44,921
This is how Abraham differs, but we're not going to get to Abraham.

767
01:07:44,921 --> 01:07:55,560
But on 65, about eight lines down, my behavior would vitiate the whole story, for I would have been at loss had I got Isaac back again.

768
01:07:55,561 --> 01:07:58,521
Isaac is the loved one, the significant one.

769
01:07:59,481 --> 01:08:13,400
What Abraham found easiest to do, to find joy again in Isaac, for he was with all infinity on his own accord, his own responsibility, for he who, with all his so-and-so and so-and-so, has made the infinite movement and can do no more.

770
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,960
That person keeps Isaac with pain.

771
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:17,400
Now let's look at the chart.

772
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:18,600
We just have time.

773
01:08:18,601 --> 01:08:19,640
What is it now?

774
01:08:19,641 --> 01:08:21,160
It's very tricky.

775
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:25,160
And it took me years to sort it out, and I think I've got it.

776
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:31,160
After you make the unconditional commitment, everybody has to make the movement of resignation.

777
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:40,600
That is, they have to discover that they could be sufficient unto themselves, that they could get along with just the memory.

778
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,841
I don't know if I can just flip to it, but I was going to.

779
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:53,921
Yes, on page 73, I'm going to start a little about 50 lines down.

780
01:08:50,441 --> 01:08:55,601
This is the night of resignation.

781
01:08:55,761 --> 01:08:59,600
He keeps his love young and it grows with him in years and beauty.

782
01:08:59,601 --> 01:09:02,881
On the other hand, he needs no finite occasion for its growth.

783
01:09:02,881 --> 01:09:05,921
From the moment he made the movement, the princess is lost.

784
01:09:05,921 --> 01:09:15,921
He needs none of this erotic titillation of the nerves at the sight of the beloved one, nor does he need in the finite sense to be continually making his farewell, for his memory of her is the eternal one.

785
01:09:15,921 --> 01:09:18,480
That's a good summary of what we've been saying.

786
01:09:18,481 --> 01:09:26,160
And now, a little further down, he has grasped the deep secret that even in loving another, one should be sufficient unto oneself.

787
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,080
Now, that's really important.

788
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,160
That's related to his move.

789
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:35,040
I mean, that is, he's made an even more extreme kind of mediation.

790
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:46,560
He's seen that you could get along just on the memory of the significance of this, and that saves him from a certain kind of fanaticism.

791
01:09:46,561 --> 01:09:52,801
I mean, when Lear goes crazy because Cordelia is dead, it's because he can't live without her.

792
01:09:52,801 --> 01:09:58,960
And Romeo and Juliet each kills themselves because they can't live without each other.

793
01:09:59,681 --> 01:10:02,720
That's not what should be happening.

794
01:10:02,721 --> 01:10:07,440
I mean, that everybody should be able, and this gets rid of total dependence.

795
01:10:07,441 --> 01:10:10,721
I mean, like the story about women who love too much and so forth.

796
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:25,680
You're not supposed to be in a frame of mind where you think that there's no substance in you, no meaning in you, that you don't get from the other person, because then you can be completely dependent on the other person, like at LH, too.

797
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:34,160
So first you have to see that you are a real person, and you could get along without this other person.

798
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:35,560
You wouldn't be in despair.

799
01:10:35,561 --> 01:10:39,080
You wouldn't have the blissful life that human beings could have.

800
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:42,761
But you don't have to go into grief either.

801
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,680
You see them.

802
01:10:44,681 --> 01:10:47,480
You could live without them.

803
01:10:47,481 --> 01:10:51,881
But, of course, when you see that, Now you have a choice.

804
01:10:51,881 --> 01:10:54,520
That's the movement of resignation up on the chart.

805
01:10:54,521 --> 01:10:57,480
You become self-sufficient rather than dependent.

806
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:06,600
But then you can become a knight of resignation, a full-fledged card-carrying knight of resignation.

807
01:11:06,601 --> 01:11:16,440
The one who really does it exactly right is someone who now lives their life in terms of the movement of resignation.

808
01:11:16,441 --> 01:11:29,640
That is, they constantly live by the fact that they're self-sufficient, that they've got the memory in them, that there's nothing that they need outside of them.

809
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:33,080
And what happens with the knight of faith?

810
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,720
Well, the knight of faith does something higher.

811
01:11:35,721 --> 01:11:45,400
The knight of faith manages, and this is the puzzling thing, to become, to see the sword.

812
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,480
I wish I could open to that one, but I probably can't.

813
01:11:47,481 --> 01:11:49,480
To see the sword hanging over the head of the beloved.

814
01:11:49,481 --> 01:11:54,040
Now I read the first half of it and live as if it's the surest thing of all.

815
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:55,881
Yeah, 79.

816
01:11:56,841 --> 01:12:04,761
Every moment to see the sword hanging over the head of the beloved's head and yet find not repose in the pain of resignation.

817
01:12:04,761 --> 01:12:07,080
See, the sword is the vulnerability, of course.

818
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:10,841
But joy on the strength of the absurd, that's wonderful and so forth.

819
01:12:10,841 --> 01:12:12,360
Now, what does that mean?

820
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:24,240
That means that by some kind of faith which we haven't defined yet, and it certainly isn't faith that you're going to get it settled in the afterlife or that God's going to intervene and make everything all right.

821
01:12:24,561 --> 01:12:40,160
But something called faith, the knight of faith, is able to, and this is the tricky part, see the vulnerability and go on getting more and more deeply involved completely defenselessly.

822
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:46,960
And that's just paradoxical because you can't make any rational sense out of it.

823
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:53,200
Why would anybody who sees the vulnerability just go on and on getting more deeply involved?

824
01:12:53,841 --> 01:12:59,921
Well, and the answer is: there's no way to make sense of why anybody should do it.

825
01:12:59,921 --> 01:13:05,120
And of course, they could always take the chicken exit and just become a knight of resignation.

826
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:09,120
But the question is, why would, but then they wouldn't be getting more and more involved.

827
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:27,680
There's this peculiar state of mind, and it's not a state of mind exactly, that the knight of faith sees that it's completely irrational to get involved with another person without any defenses of the sort that the knight of resignation, and then gets more and more defenselessly involved anyway.

828
01:13:27,681 --> 01:13:36,881
So, what their reason does and what their emotions do are in conflict, and they are able to live in that conflict.

829
01:13:36,881 --> 01:13:40,400
And by that, they get the bliss because they get everything.

830
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,921
They get the other person.

831
01:13:41,921 --> 01:13:44,000
Now, there's lots of puzzles there.

832
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:48,640
Have they made the other person immortal some way so they can't die?

833
01:13:48,641 --> 01:13:51,200
No, they see that the other person can die.

834
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,360
And yet they get more and more involved.

835
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,560
How can that be?

836
01:13:54,561 --> 01:13:59,520
Well, that's the subject for the next lecture when we get to the night of resignation.

837
01:13:59,481 --> 01:14:01,040
Now we'll have to stop.

838
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,160
I'm going to I'll talk to you.

839
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,120
Come on up.
