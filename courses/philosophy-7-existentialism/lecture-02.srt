1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,999
Okay, so let me review where we were last time and go on from there.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,080
So there's these opposed traditions in our culture.

3
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:14,559
Traditions isn't even the right word because one of them believes in traditions and one doesn't.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:24,839
But there are opposed ideas of what the how can we put it of what people are here for.

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,519
Something like that.

6
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:33,239
And there is the rational philosophical view of what people are up to.

7
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:45,160
And it believes that people should, as much as possible, be able to understand and develop theories and that theories are true or false.

8
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,880
And they're true if they correspond to the facts.

9
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:55,960
And a true theory isn't subjective, doesn't matter who holds it, it's objective, and it doesn't matter what they care about.

10
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,799
When they're doing theory, they become detached and disinterested.

11
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,799
That should be easy for you to understand.

12
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:07,559
That's what you do almost in every part of your education in the university.

13
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,600
In ethics, this is Greek, by the way.

14
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:19,799
I've called it philosophical and I called it Greek, and they're interchangeable from the perspective I'm giving you here.

15
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,919
And now the ethical issues.

16
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:35,079
Any particular person should subordinate his or her personal, selfish interests to whatever the universal moral principles require.

17
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:42,520
The simplest way to put that is that the basic proposition in ethics is don't make an exception of yourself.

18
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:49,559
If you're thinking, well, I can get away with this, but not everybody could do it, then you're not being ethical.

19
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,919
That and the moral of that is that the universal is higher than the individual.

20
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:57,239
And oh, by the way, maybe I I gotta back up.

21
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:03,119
I'm giving you new slogans for these three, the slogans that Kierkegaard is going to use.

22
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,559
When in the truth business, truth is objectivity, it says.

23
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:09,600
I was just saying that.

24
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,400
Whenever you get a true theory, it's unsubjective.

25
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,519
It's for everybody.

26
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,999
In the ethics business, the universal is higher than the individual.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,039
That is, always do what anybody would do.

28
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,960
Never make an exception of yourself and say, well, only I can do this.

29
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,759
And in the ultimate reality business, the ultimate reality is abstract and eternal.

30
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,079
Nothing important happens in time.

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,960
And now the Kierkegaard idea is to reach eternity, you have to get out of time.

32
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,520
I mean, Kierkegaard thinks so many, it's not his view.

33
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,799
I'm not being very clear.

34
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:53,760
Kierkegaard's way of summing up the philosophical view is truth is objectivity, the universal is higher than the individual.

35
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,879
You get to eternity by getting out of time.

36
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,199
A lot of philosophers held this.

37
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,520
We pinning it on Plato as the first who really said these held this view.

38
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:17,679
Then I was saying in our culture, we've got this opposed way of thinking about what people should be doing, which is the Judeo-Christian revelation.

39
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,720
Somebody asked me, the Judeo means the same as the Hebrews.

40
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,280
Yes, I mean, that sometimes I call them the Hebrews, sometimes somewhere along the line.

41
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,960
I wish I knew, somebody must know, they got to be called the Jews.

42
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:38,239
But whatever we but I'm just going to call this, as the people do, the Judeo-Christian way of looking at things.

43
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:49,800
And another point I want to make somewhere along is I realize that lots that to lots of you, this isn't your religion, neither Jewish nor Christian.

44
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:59,479
The idea of God being coming, giving the Ten Commandments and becoming incarnate in Jesus and all that is pretty strange.

45
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:07,400
If it's really strange, you should ask me or you're in office hours or your TA to give you something to read or to explain it to you.

46
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,160
I mean, Christianity, I'm Jewish.

47
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,239
Christianity was very strange to me.

48
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:28,760
That's an advantage in a way if you come at this from outside, because I think the people who've grown up in some religion, Jewish or Christian, or presumably the same thing would happen to a Buddhist too, they get so they hear all these words and they don't really think about them or understand what they mean.

49
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:34,520
They just become a kind of mantra or something that you repeat on the appropriate occasions.

50
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:46,280
But if you come at it from the outside, you know, when I first read the New Testament when I was about 25 or something, I thought it was just fantastic and absolutely weird in an interesting way.

51
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,840
And no weirder than the Old Testament, which is weird in a different way.

52
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,080
And I guess no weirder than Plato.

53
00:04:53,080 --> 00:05:03,160
But Plato somehow is so close to us theory people that it all sounds perfectly straightforward, even if we don't altogether agree with him anymore.

54
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:12,119
Okay, so the special problem is how do you live in a culture that's got these two conflicted traditions?

55
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:14,679
And you want to be a thoughtful person.

56
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:16,999
You want to be able to think and reflect.

57
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:24,640
Then you also want to be most alive to your particular time and your situation and what it is to be a human being?

58
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,520
Do you want to be true to your deepest experiences.

59
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,960
And they're so different.

60
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:36,799
I mean, the Greeks have given us a way of thinking and being rational and being detached and disinterested.

61
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:48,239
And the J Deo-Christians have given us these extreme feelings of involvement and commitment, and just the opposite, you see, of being detached, disinterested.

62
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:50,640
And how do you get that together?

63
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,999
No culture is like ours in being having two fundamental opposed sources.

64
00:05:57,999 --> 00:06:09,679
I mean, there are cultures, I'm pretty sure, though I don't know much about other cultures, that have two very different dominant ways of thinking about what human beings are up to.

65
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:11,440
The main one I think of is China.

66
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,919
I take it that the Buddhists and their Confucians and there are lots of each of them.

67
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,799
But they haven't got opposed views.

68
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:22,640
They've got sort of complementary views about what to do, I think.

69
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,520
And the Japanese are marvelous in this.

70
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:39,119
I spent a month in Japan a year ago, and among other things, I learned that there are more people signed up for various religions in Japan than there are people in Japan.

71
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:41,280
And that's because they sign up for several.

72
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:48,079
And right now, it's popular to be born as a Hindu, married as a Christian, and die as a Buddhist.

73
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:52,800
Each of those religions has got a good insight into something.

74
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,479
And why should you not try to take the best from all of them?

75
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,119
That's, again, not a conflicted culture.

76
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:06,960
I mean, if you've got lots of gods, and you can just pick and choose among them for every and just get the God that fits the occasion, that seems all right.

77
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,280
But that's not how it is in our culture.

78
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:19,720
We've got these two traditions, and we feel sort of totally committed to both of them, thinking and feeling, rationality and revelation.

79
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:24,600
We don't think that they complement each other, and we don't think we have to choose.

80
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:28,440
So I summed it all up here with a lot of words.

81
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,160
I'll go slow.

82
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:50,680
The Greek tradition of detached, disembodied, timeless, universal, reflective, critical, rationality, that's kind of mouthful, versus the Hebrew Revelation, which is involved, embodied, historical, local, committed.

83
00:07:50,999 --> 00:08:00,040
And we've got a culture which believes both of these and lives both of these, and it is very confused.

84
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,360
I think we are very confused.

85
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:13,000
Before time is up, I hope to get to at least the point where you can see that there's a big mess that needs to be cleaned up and that Kierkegaard is the one to do it.

86
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:25,239
So the first attempt to fix this tension, which lasts, and this first attempt lasted 1,500 years in our culture, was to reconcile the two.

87
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:33,320
After all, it looks like there ought to be a way of thinking about the Judeo-Christian Revelation.

88
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,960
There ought to be a way of getting your feelings and your thinking together.

89
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:45,720
So people started to try to put the Judeo-Christian experience into Greek categories, Greek concepts.

90
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,360
And I'll give you a real quick rundown of that.

91
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:56,920
It's a fascinating story of the philosophical moves in our culture, but we haven't, it's not our job to go into it.

92
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:10,320
But already in the Gospel of John, which is the latest of the four gospels, John is Greek, and he's already trying to put the Christian message into Greek.

93
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,720
And for those of you who know the Gospel of John, I should really know sort of what level of which in this audience I'm talking to.

94
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,680
How many know the Gospel?

95
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:20,000
I've read the Gospel of John.

96
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,840
Okay, about half.

97
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,400
Well, you're ahead of where I was at your age.

98
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:33,119
And in any case, the Gospel of John says that Jesus was the word, and the word was made flesh.

99
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:39,920
The word in Greek is logos, and logos means the rational structure of the universe.

100
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:53,760
So John is trying to get the two traditions together and say, well, to say Jesus was God is to say that he embodied in some way, in its most complete and perfect form, some deep rational truth about the universe.

101
00:09:53,759 --> 00:10:00,160
That's already making a big move from what I think, what one would think Jesus would think about.

102
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,600
But it's beginning to put it into philosophy, into Greek.

103
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:11,440
And then there were the church fathers, of which Saint Augustine is the most famous, who lived around 300 AD.

104
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:18,320
And he had the bright idea of just putting all the Christian terms into Platonic terms.

105
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,519
And it looked pretty neat.

106
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:35,520
Plato had this ultimate, abstract, supreme something or other, which he called the good, which was the ground of everything and made everything grow and made everything intelligible and gave moral guidelines.

107
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:46,160
And it wasn't a person, but it seemed very much like the, and it wasn't a creator, but it did have a lot of the characteristics of the Hebrew Christian God.

108
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:53,720
So Plato, so Augustine thought of Plato and the Judeo-Christian tradition as really on the same track.

109
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,760
And at a certain level of abstraction, it's quite right.

110
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:02,759
I mean, it's that they are religions which believe in the Supreme Being, the two of them.

111
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:07,640
And that's already separating them from almost every other, maybe every other religion at all.

112
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:11,640
I mean, thinking of Islam as part of the Judeo-Christian tradition.

113
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:14,919
I can't, it would just complicate things too much to add a third.

114
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:22,600
And at this level, there are these religions, and there's not all over the place who believe in a supreme being.

115
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,760
Buddhism doesn't, Shintoism doesn't.

116
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:26,280
Hinduism doesn't.

117
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,000
I don't know enough religions, but I don't know any other ones except these two.

118
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:34,040
So it was natural for Augustine to put them together.

119
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,200
Only it was disastrous, too.

120
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:45,400
Because if you read Augustine's Confessions, which I used to like to teach, because you see the tension in it, that he can't make sense of the creation.

121
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,760
Why was it good?

122
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:54,120
It only got in the way of being directly related to God to have all these finite things around to love and attract to.

123
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,840
He says, well, it was good for God, but it wasn't really good for people.

124
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,800
And he doesn't have a view of the incarnation.

125
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:08,040
It's really, Jesus is just a path toward God.

126
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,360
The Gospel of John already says Jesus is the truth and the way.

127
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:14,919
And in Augustine, Jesus is pretty much the way.

128
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:23,399
He's just an example to lead you through the direct experience of the Supreme Being.

129
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,600
So he's having trouble with that.

130
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:37,760
And he's having trouble, which we're going to go into a lot, with God's command to Abraham that he should kill Isaac, because that doesn't sound like a universal command that every father should go out and kill their son.

131
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,760
So Augustine reads it as saying, Oh, yes, it's a universal command.

132
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:43,200
God is always ethical.

133
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,720
It means everybody should do whatever God commands.

134
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:52,000
Thereby it's sort of taking the thing out of it, the craziness out of it.

135
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:54,399
And so Augustine doesn't do a very good job.

136
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,280
Putting it into Plato terms didn't really make it.

137
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:14,159
And as soon as somebody came along, who another philosopher, Aristotle, whose lectures were mouldering away in some basement, as soon as they got discovered and translated first into Arabic and finally into Latin, then St.

138
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:21,200
Thomas Aquinas, I should write these people on the board as soon as I find thought.

139
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:30,880
So when I name people and say things that I don't write on the board, people get rightly annoyed.

140
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,160
So tell me.

141
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,119
So here we got St.

142
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,640
Augustine.

143
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,039
And then we've got St.

144
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:48,640
Thomas Aquinas, which is who I'm talking about now.

145
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,519
A two you.

146
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,239
See, writing on the board is not fun.

147
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,920
I've always thought I should have a secretary who wrote on the board while I taught.

148
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,880
Okay, so Augustine, 300 A.D.

149
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:07,760
as Aquinas, roughly 1300.

150
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:18,360
So a thousand years before they dug up Aristotle's stuff and thought that it found it was sensational and in many ways anti-Plato.

151
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:24,440
And Aristotle thought that bodies were important and that the soul was the form of the body.

152
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:34,119
And he thought that individual things were important and not just some abstract super entity or like the good.

153
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:44,040
And he had lots of criticisms of Plato that put him, definitely put his philosophy closer to the Judeo-Christian tradition.

154
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,119
And therefore, St.

155
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:49,800
Thomas putting Christianity strictly into Aristotle terms.

156
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,200
See, Aristotle still had some superbeing.

157
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,520
He called it the unmoved mover.

158
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:58,359
And therefore, aha, God must be the unmoved mover.

159
00:14:58,359 --> 00:15:03,479
These pagans were getting it closer and getting it righter, they thought.

160
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,680
And so you just put them together.

161
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:13,960
And that's not bad, except that in the end, in Aristotle and in St.

162
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:24,679
Thomas, contemplation of this supreme being and the unmoved mover was more important than involvement in the world and in action.

163
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:38,039
So they, again, sort of philosophical, universal, objective reflection, so they gobbled up what was special about the Judeo-Christian tradition.

164
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:47,879
The way to see it, and I teach this in Philosophy 6, is when you read Dante's Divine Comedy, Dante, in roughly 1300, was putting St.

165
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:53,399
Thomas's version of Christianity into his poem.

166
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:58,399
And Dante has already discovered, in fact, it's relevant for me to say this someplace.

167
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:15,279
At the same time that Aquinas was putting Christianity into philosophical terms, some group of people called the Troubadours were inventing romantic love.

168
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:29,759
wasn't any romantic love until they came along with their story of knights and ladies and how a knight could dedicate his whole life and get his identity and the meaning of his life out of his dedication to his lady.

169
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,439
And Dante felt that he had the same experience with Beatrice.

170
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:37,680
So Dante wrote a super love poem about Beatrice.

171
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:42,080
It's super, super, but I don't want to get sidetracked into talking about it.

172
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:59,199
But one of the amazing things is, having explained how Beatrice is the most important thing in his life that gives it meaning, in fact, having gone so far as to put Beatrice in the place of Jesus as his savior, he said he was going to write a love poem to his girlfriend like nobody ever wrote before, and he sure did.

173
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:10,480
So putting straightforward, putting Beatrice into the position of savior, he nonetheless drops Beatrice at the end for contemplation directly of God.

174
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,399
And what could be more fulfilling than that?

175
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:14,879
Even loving Beatrice wasn't as good as that.

176
00:17:14,879 --> 00:17:25,359
And that's the Aristotle, Thomistic losing the essential point of the Judeo-Christian tradition, which they almost had.

177
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,160
And then it goes into eclipse until Kierkegaard gets it.

178
00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:33,840
And what I'm really telling you, among other things, is why the knight of faith is a knight.

179
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,600
I mean, why bring that in?

180
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,000
Because Kierkegaard's connecting up with the troubadours and the romantic tradition.

181
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,239
Only this time he's not going to let philosophy wipe it out.

182
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,720
So, okay, after St.

183
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:49,560
Thomas, nothing happens for a while.

184
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,039
Then somebody should turn off their phone.

185
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,440
Right.

186
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:54,359
Please turn off your phones.

187
00:17:54,359 --> 00:18:00,759
So then 300 years further on, now we're at 1600.

188
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:16,840
Descartes, whom I mentioned last time, and who's the philosopher who brings us to modernity.

189
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:17,800
What am I going to say?

190
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,720
1600, roughly.

191
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:38,119
Okay, Descartes has gone so into the philosophical thing that he's lost any sense that God has anything to do with being, with an incarnation in a body, with coming into time, with whatever.

192
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:44,280
I mean, anything that I said about involvement, about commitment, about the Jewish people being selected by God.

193
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,080
I mean, that's just as far as you could imagine from Descartes.

194
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,039
He thinks that God is eternal, infinite.

195
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,240
Maybe not infinite.

196
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,519
Does he think God is infinite?

197
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,039
I don't know.

198
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:55,959
It doesn't matter.

199
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:59,640
Perfect, fully intelligible, good.

200
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,679
And he thinks that when he's talking about that God, he's talking about the Christian God.

201
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:10,759
He doesn't even notice that he's got no place for love and commitment and so forth in his story.

202
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,080
And that's, so to speak, the last straw.

203
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:28,119
1,500 years has kind of wiped out putting the Judeo-Christian revelation and experience, which is so original and so important, into the conceptual terms of philosophers, has finally lost it altogether.

204
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:37,679
It took sort of 1,500 years downhill as far as managing to think about this super experience.

205
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,159
And then comes our hero Pascal, whom I wrote on the board last time.

206
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:46,959
Pascal says that he's the first.

207
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:49,919
Well, he doesn't say he's the first existential thinker.

208
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,919
I say he's the first existentialist.

209
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,480
This is the beginning of existentialism, and I'll tell you why in a second.

210
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:12,879
Maybe you can figure out what would you have to say if you were going to sort of throw over this whole failed attempt to make the Judeo-Christian revelation thinkable.

211
00:20:13,199 --> 00:20:21,840
By the way, somebody also I realized I never explained whenever I talk about the Judeo-Christian perspective, that is the existentialist perspective.

212
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:29,919
So I'm always thinking Greek philosopher versus Judeo-Christian existentialist.

213
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,720
So what would it take for Pascal to be the first existentialist?

214
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:39,439
Well, he had a religious experience.

215
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:48,560
He was a brilliant philosopher and mathematician, religious thinker, and he had this vision or this sort of revelation.

216
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:57,600
And the moral of the revelation, he wrote to himself in a note: the God of the philosophers is not the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

217
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,799
And he understood that that way, and he was thinking against Descartes.

218
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,879
He was a generation after Descartes.

219
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,399
He thought that Descartes was sort of the worst thing.

220
00:21:06,719 --> 00:21:10,959
So a case of total rationalism and pride.

221
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:16,560
But the main thing is that the God of the philosophers is not the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

222
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:27,080
Pascal sees that, sees that that's so important that he wrote it on a piece of paper which he kept thrown into his undershirt so that he could always have it close to him and with him.

223
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,600
And that's the beginning of what I'm telling you.

224
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:43,400
That there's a whole other side to our culture and our view of God and our way of life, and we'd lost it insofar as if we were following Descartes and being modern.

225
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:45,560
Descartes' the beginning of modernity.

226
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,879
And we better stop and find out what's going on.

227
00:21:50,840 --> 00:22:22,119
Well, Pascal thought that God was a hidden God, was a God, a personal God to whom you could pray, and that the human condition was extremely paradoxical because human beings were sort of like God and sort of like sort of miserable creatures, and that the problem was how to be able to be both like a God without pride and to be a miserable creature without despair.

228
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:29,959
He had all these sort of existentialist problems that arise once you try to put these two traditions together.

229
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,919
And he's really the culmination.

230
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:38,199
There was, and I have to mention it, one last attempt to put it all together.

231
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:39,639
Very impressive.

232
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:44,999
I always stand up because there are things that I don't want them to be the way they are.

233
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,399
Oh, well, we're going to put him down here.

234
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:48,519
Hegel.

235
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,879
Hegel, and did I put a date for Hegel?

236
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:53,879
Oh, in 1800.

237
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,239
It's not very good, is it?

238
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:34,879
Okay, Hegel, another great philosopher, tried very hard to get together what he calls sometimes reason and history to make Christianity a kind of true story that captures what philosophers are really trying to say in a kind of poetic, mythical way, but that they try to make them completely compatible.

239
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:39,999
And that's the last straw, so to speak, from Kierkegaard's point of view.

240
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:51,279
Kierkegaard, just as Pascal thought that Descartes was a kind of disaster, Kierkegaard thinks that Hegel is a kind of disaster who has lost all Christianity.

241
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,999
So we get down here, Kierkegaard, 1850.

242
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:05,679
And Kierkegaard says that he's an existential thinker and he's going to fix, he's going to, well, what?

243
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,080
You see, I'll get there in a little while.

244
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:15,359
Whatever he's going to do, he's not going to put the Judeo-Christian tradition in new philosophical better terms.

245
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:17,759
He's not going to tell you how to think it.

246
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,560
But he's not going to tell you either, you can't relate it to philosophy at all.

247
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,119
He's going to relate it to philosophy a lot.

248
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:35,119
And how he's going to do that, oppose it to philosophy and relate it to philosophy, that's a very important story, but I'm not quite ready yet to tell it.

249
00:24:38,639 --> 00:24:47,600
I'm going to go back one last time to the the the mess the culture's in that Kierkegaard has such a brilliant solution for.

250
00:24:48,679 --> 00:25:06,359
So now we've got the two views of God, the philosophical rational view of God and the Christian God of Revelation, and they're opposed to each other as to what knowledge is, ethics is, reality is, and they cancel each other out.

251
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:09,560
When you try to put them together, they undermine each other.

252
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:22,279
That is, we just saw how rationality undermines the Christian story, or as one after another Christian thinker tries to think Christianity in Greek terms.

253
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:34,759
And sort of Christianity undermines rationality by going on holding all these absolutely outrageous beliefs in spite of the theologians and in spite of the philosophers.

254
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:40,119
And it just seems that reason turns out to be just dangerous.

255
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:49,719
And in Paradise Lost, for instance, the only one who talks sort of theology and Christian philosophy is Satan.

256
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:56,279
Adam and Eve are too, too, luckily too naive to be taken in by that.

257
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,840
So the problem is still around.

258
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:08,039
And it isn't easy to get together objectivity and commitment and reason and faith.

259
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:15,479
And somehow we need to be true to critical reflection and passionate commitment in our lives.

260
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:20,919
Otherwise, everything gets canceled out and get some kind of out of some kind of collision.

261
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:23,959
I'm going to try to show you what that means in a second.

262
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:42,239
But if you don't try, if you try to live exclusively in terms of one or the other, you can't, because you have always in the background, for instance, the romantic love experience that doesn't fit into the theory story and the theory thinking that doesn't fit into the romantic love story.

263
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,679
What are you going to do about it?

264
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,679
Well, it looks like we've just inherited the worst of all worlds.

265
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:56,800
We've inherited a world in which we've got two traditions that you can't get together, you can't get rid of, and are sort of tearing each other up.

266
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,679
And that's what is happening, I think.

267
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,039
Or is still happening.

268
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:08,720
But if you were all Kierkegaardians or Dostoevsky's, you could rescue yourself from it.

269
00:27:09,439 --> 00:27:11,359
That's what existentialists think.

270
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:13,119
That's what the Course is about.

271
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:24,879
But let me give you some feel for what it's like to be caught in this contradictory tradition by sort of appealing to your own intuitions and show you that they're contradictory.

272
00:27:24,879 --> 00:27:28,560
I'm going to say, let's talk about knowledge.

273
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:45,119
So we believe both the truth is universal and objective, and you should be as dispassionate about it as possible, and we admire people willing to die for what they believe is the truth.

274
00:27:45,439 --> 00:27:46,800
And we shouldn't.

275
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,480
I mean, one way or the other.

276
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,320
Galileo knew we shouldn't.

277
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:56,879
Galileo thought that he had figured out that the earth was moving around the sun.

278
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:59,760
It wasn't that the sun was moving around the earth.

279
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,759
The earth was moving around the sun.

280
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:11,359
The church, the Inquisition, said, you have to give that up and say that's false, or we'll burn you.

281
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:16,479
And Galileo gave it up and supposedly muttered under his breath, but it moves anyway.

282
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,039
And so, why should he give his life for an objective truth?

283
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:28,199
I mean, and on the other hand, Bruno, whom I don't know much about, what's his first name?

284
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:38,759
Giard Geodorno, I think Bruno, was a philosopher at the same time as Galileo.

285
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:46,279
And he had this view that there were infinitely many worlds, and for him it was a kind of religious conviction.

286
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:52,200
And when he was told that if he didn't take it back, he would be burned, he wouldn't take it back.

287
00:28:52,679 --> 00:29:00,840
He wanted to be a martyr because this truth was absolutely crucial to who he was, that he understood it and he was dedicated to it.

288
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,760
And so they burned Bruno.

289
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,279
Now, who are we for?

290
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:17,639
Galileo, who thought that if it was true, he didn't have to die for it, or Bruno, who thought that the kind of truth that really mattered was a kind of truth that you'd be willing to be a martyr for.

291
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:19,720
I think we pull both ways.

292
00:29:19,719 --> 00:29:23,240
We admire them both, but they're absolutely different.

293
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,399
One says it'd be crazy to die for your view.

294
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:29,639
Objective truth doesn't need you.

295
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,800
And truth is irrelevant to the meaning of our lives.

296
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:48,919
And the other one says what's really important about truth is that you're committed to something so totally, and it's so important in your life that you'd be ready to die rather than give it up or repudiate it in any way.

297
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:56,679
Okay, I don't know about you all, but I certainly have intuitions that Galileo ought to be my hero and that Bruno ought to be my hero.

298
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:01,480
And in morality, you get the same kind of problem that's much closer to home.

299
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,200
I mean, you can find it right in your own living room or fraternity or sorority.

300
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:11,759
And that is the conflict between conformity and individualism in our culture.

301
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:17,279
I mean, in most cultures, I think they are conformists, and that's that.

302
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,919
Maybe there are cultures in which everybody's a kind of individual and that is that.

303
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,199
But we don't know what to do.

304
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:36,959
What I mean by that, and Kierkegaard has lots to say about that, is we want to do what we can justify to ourselves and to our classmates and friends.

305
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:43,679
And we don't feel comfortable unless we can explain what we're doing, which is ethical.

306
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:50,320
That is, show that this is a principle that any rational, good person should follow, what you're doing.

307
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,999
On the other hand, you don't want to be just like everybody else.

308
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,039
You don't feel comfortable doing what everybody else does.

309
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,199
You'd really like to stand out from the crowd and do something different.

310
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,399
But remember, don't make an exception of yourself.

311
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:12,720
How are you going to be able to make your, you know, do something that matters and makes a difference and follow the principle, don't make an exception of yourself.

312
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:14,800
That's where we're in that.

313
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:21,279
If your way of life is good, it's good for you as an individual and only for you.

314
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,119
There's one possibility.

315
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:28,480
Or to be good for you, it should be good for everyone who's in the same situation.

316
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,039
That's the Greek philosophical view.

317
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:38,959
And what I think happens is you bounce back and forth in between the extremes of this.

318
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:47,720
So people either they become moral absolutists and they try to f find some universal rational principle.

319
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:50,039
They try to be able to show what's right.

320
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,800
Philosophers are still doing it.

321
00:31:52,119 --> 00:32:02,600
They want everybody to see that there's one right way of thinking and one right way of acting and at least a certain level of abstraction.

322
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:16,359
The people you might hear about in philosophy courses is John Rawls, who has a theory of justice, just like Plato had a theory of justice, and he thinks it's true for everybody that that's what justice is and what you have to do to be just.

323
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:19,320
And there's Habermas in Germany, Jürgen Habermas.

324
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:26,200
I won't write them on the board either, Rawls or Habermas, because they're contemporary people who are not going to yet.

325
00:32:26,199 --> 00:32:29,400
You don't want to talk about contemporary people yet.

326
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:38,520
But in any case, there is a kind of attempt to show rationally what's right.

327
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:43,719
And then there are the people who say, no, you can't do that, that the revelation tells us what's right.

328
00:32:43,719 --> 00:32:45,639
You have to trust in God's word.

329
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:47,480
Everybody's got to obey it.

330
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,080
That's the Christian right.

331
00:32:49,080 --> 00:33:00,920
So you've got the sort of rational justice left who thinks they've got proof and the Christian revelation right and who think they've got some evidence for their view.

332
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,720
And there's this clash between them.

333
00:33:03,719 --> 00:33:08,440
And I think what really happens is they cancel each other out for lots of people.

334
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:20,360
If rational ethics doesn't motivate you, doesn't seem to have any grip on you, just proving what's right, then it looks like that's not going to do.

335
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:25,080
But if you want some kind of ethics, it does have a grip on you, it looks like fanaticism.

336
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:30,119
There's something that you believe you should do, whether you can make any rational sense of it or not.

337
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:37,840
And you end up, if this story is right, with no moral standards, with the view that everybody should just do their own thing.

338
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:42,079
A kind of laid-back tolerance.

339
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:50,240
The true, the sense behind, I think, the phrase, whatever.

340
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:57,520
I mean, you get, that's the sign that the ethical system has crashed somehow.

341
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:01,759
So, and now in metaphysics, that was ethics.

342
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:04,000
Ethics ends up in whatever, I think.

343
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,920
And now, metaphysics.

344
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:16,159
Well, you wouldn't think that something like the ultimate reality really impinges on people's lives and that they take either Greek or Christian sides.

345
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,040
But they do.

346
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:30,560
In the 70s, when I came here, people were taking LSD and engaging in meditation and were trying to have peak experiences of direct confrontation and contemplation of ultimate reality.

347
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:44,400
Huxley wrote a book about how drugs open the doors of perception and get rid of all your concepts and make you get you face to face with, well, what he thought was ultimate reality.

348
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:58,560
And Timothy Leary was saying, tune in and drop out, meaning don't get involved in politics, don't get involved in history and tradition, don't get committed to anything, just have as many peak experiences as possible.

349
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,600
And in other verse, that's all Greek.

350
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:21,319
I think, although it got taken up in the Judeo-Christian tradition, as all Greek things did, into a kind of mystical, contemplative version of relation to God, it's a long way from the covenant with God where you're supposed to do something in the world that is totally dedicated to Him.

351
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:30,280
So, and then another aspect of the Greek was the human potential movement or the self-realization people.

352
00:35:30,279 --> 00:35:38,280
Remember, the Greeks thought there's nothing new, that there's no radical rebirth and retransform, or transform, there's no radical rebirth.

353
00:35:38,279 --> 00:35:48,040
There's just sort of the pattern that was implicit in the universe or in your life can become explicit, but there's nothing new.

354
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,360
So, that's one way you could go.

355
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,280
That would be the Greek influence.

356
00:35:52,279 --> 00:36:02,600
The Christian influence is commitment, for instance, taking a stand and being ready to die for civil rights or against the Vietnam War.

357
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,520
Those are the things that really make a difference.

358
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,600
Commitment is what matters.

359
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:17,959
And in personal lives, instead of the self-realization, there was a movement of personal transformation.

360
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,279
That was S.

361
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:21,479
I don't know if any of you remember.

362
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,439
That's now sort of reborn as the forum, which some of you might have heard of.

363
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:37,799
But these are sort of ways that people think that it sort of replaces Christian being reborn, but it's a kind of being reborn.

364
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:50,519
They think that these forms of training, as the S people used to call it, can give people radical transformation experiences.

365
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:57,399
But so, what do you people do?

366
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:59,079
Well, I don't know what they do.

367
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,679
I mean, partly you know what they do.

368
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:03,520
I mean, they don't do either of these things.

369
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:09,119
They don't go around dropping a lot of acid and having mystical experiences of ultimate reality anymore.

370
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:14,960
And I don't think they go to these sort of workshops and become reborn anymore either.

371
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,560
Or they oscillate back and forth.

372
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,479
Maybe they go to workshops and are reborn on some days and drop acid on other days.

373
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,760
I'm not sure.

374
00:37:21,759 --> 00:37:37,280
But whatever it is, Nietzsche would call it a kind of nihilism because there seems to be no guiding understanding, no principle that you can sort of really live in terms of and hold on to.

375
00:37:37,279 --> 00:37:38,479
I said, stop about that.

376
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,159
I'm going to get to Kierkegaard.

377
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:46,320
But before I do, there must be some reaction to all of this I've been talking too long.

378
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:53,760
Anybody think that I have messed up the story or could tell it better or anything?

379
00:37:54,639 --> 00:38:00,639
Again, it's not something I, you know, I expect that you have to have an opinion about since you haven't done the reading and there isn't any reading.

380
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:02,319
I'm making it up as I go along.

381
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:02,879
Go ahead.

382
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,720
Ah, I'm going to think about that.

383
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:25,280
Not for long, because we can wait till we get to Nietzsche, but I just want to know what I think about it.

384
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,479
Well, yes, I see now.

385
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,360
It's all right.

386
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,920
It's not the Platonic tradition.

387
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,759
It merged with the Platonic tradition.

388
00:38:41,759 --> 00:38:44,880
But when he says Greek tradition, he probably means the Homeric Greeks.

389
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:58,760
He thought the Homeric Greeks had something very interesting and important, which we'll get to, which the Judeo-Christian merger with the Platonic Greeks wiped out.

390
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,880
But let's not say more about that now.

391
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,520
But I think that's the right thing to say, but I'd have to see the context to be sure.

392
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,639
Yeah.

393
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:23,080
You said that I think the sort of like state would believe that there's a kind of teaching experience in consequence.

394
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:27,559
And what's about the apathetic component of that?

395
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:41,479
I guess coming from this sort of perspective of this generation, there's a feeling of like there's nothing you can do to stop them and like no demonstration will do anything.

396
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:48,679
So there's like the Christian idea of like, okay, well, you have to, you know, blog about it or something.

397
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:55,560
And then there's the like Greek idea about one should, you know, just smoke a lot of colour or whatever.

398
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:01,480
I'm just wondering, like, what do you think of that apathetic, like somehow received?

399
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:11,560
This apathetic component that you're talking about, I think that's what you get when you when you can't, when each of these undermines the other, and that's the sort of the whatever condition.

400
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:24,119
And that's right, apathetic, I think, but I call sort of laid-back tolerance, where everybody just thinks that everybody has a right to have their own subjective experiences, and there's no other guidelines at all.

401
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,280
That's what I think is where we're at.

402
00:40:26,279 --> 00:40:32,720
And that's what I think Kierkegaard or Dostoevsky or Nietzsche could save us from, each in his own way.

403
00:40:32,279 --> 00:40:33,999
And that's what we're going to hear about.

404
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:49,760
And by the end of the course, I'm going to ask you all, because I think, after all, you're the ones who know where the culture is at, which, if any, of the three people we read gets you out of this apathy, as you call it.

405
00:40:49,759 --> 00:40:53,040
And we'll see what you think about that.

406
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:02,800
Okay, I'm ready to go on because I would like to get some Kierkegaard down before, so that you won't despair of not being able to understand a thing.

407
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,840
So, how does Kierkegaard put the two traditions together?

408
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:15,440
Well, he tries, and without canceling them out, but so they support each other.

409
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,199
That's the challenge that no philosopher and no Christian has done.

410
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:28,480
And Kierkegaard says he's going to, what he says, describe the movements that the night of faith makes.

411
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:34,800
That means describe the way of life of someone with a certain style of life.

412
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,839
They're all in movements of what he says, the night of resignation.

413
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:39,200
That's one way of living.

414
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:41,440
The night of faith is another way of living.

415
00:41:41,440 --> 00:42:03,920
He's going to try to rank various ways of living and show you that the existentialist, let's call it, way of living is going to give us not the worst of both of the worlds, but the best of both worlds by combining the Greek and the Hebrew, sorry, yeah, in a positive way.

416
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,479
But you can't justify them in a positive way, or you're back in philosophy.

417
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,360
And he certainly wants to break with philosophy.

418
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:16,159
But, and how are you going to do that and write, you know, intelligible stuff?

419
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,520
Well, instead of recognizing the two traditions, he makes two moves.

420
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:27,320
One I just said, that he's going to put them in some kind of order in which he subordinates them and ranks them.

421
00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:45,400
And he's got a good, high place for philosophy, but an even higher place for his version of Christianity, which is a very different version than any that anybody had before, and doesn't have a.

422
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,880
I want to see how to put this.

423
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:54,920
And he doesn't want to say that somehow thinking is the highest.

424
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:00,360
In fact, he thinks finally that involvement is higher than detachment.

425
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,000
And so he's going to be an existentialist.

426
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,480
He's going to be on the Judeo-Christian side.

427
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:09,639
But now, how do you express that in philosophical terms?

428
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:14,200
Well, remember, I said for philosophers, truth is objectivity.

429
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:18,360
Well, Kierkegaard's got a slogan: truth is subjectivity.

430
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:29,800
You can see what he's getting at if you think that, remember, truth for the Judeo-Christians, for the Hebrews already, is total commitment to God.

431
00:43:29,799 --> 00:43:36,520
So Kierkegaard's going to have to redefine subjectivity so that it doesn't mean just your whims.

432
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,679
Well, see, I'm getting ahead of the story, but I just sort of can't resist saying.

433
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:51,560
For Kierkegaard rankings, there's subjectivity so-called, as he calls it, which is what you believe and desire in your superstitions and what you grew up believing and so forth.

434
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:58,840
That's all got to go and be criticized by objectivity, which is philosophy.

435
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:09,119
But above that, then you're open to something higher than either of those, which he calls, which he calls subjectivity, genuine subjectivity.

436
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:15,040
Genuine subjectivity is a commitment to somebody or something.

437
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:20,320
And he has lots to say about that, which we spend a lot of time on in a little while.

438
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:28,400
That kind of commitment is what he has in mind when he says truth is subjectivity.

439
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:50,479
Maybe you should think in terms of romantic love, but if Dante thinks that when Dante experiences Beatrice as the savior in his life and commits himself completely to her, then that's what Kierkegaard means when he says truth is subjectivity.

440
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,399
It's this higher personal kind of experience.

441
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,520
Don't worry about that.

442
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,519
I'll get that a lot clearer in a little while.

443
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,359
I'm going to give you the three slogans.

444
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,360
Truth is subjectivity.

445
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:04,880
The individual is higher than the universal.

446
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:12,400
You'll see plenty of that next week when we read, or in the week after next, when we read the problems.

447
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:19,359
The problem that Abraham has is that in his life, the individual is higher than the universal.

448
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:25,040
And that's got all to do with this business of conformity and being an exception, and is that moral and all that.

449
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:29,680
And finally, and this is a really weird one, but he'll make it work.

450
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:32,799
Eternity is only possible in time.

451
00:45:33,279 --> 00:45:34,879
I'm quoting Kierkegaard on all these.

452
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,199
These are all weird slogans.

453
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:48,200
He's taking the philosophical words and saying things which make everything different, which don't give unusual meaning to any of these philosophical terms.

454
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:53,639
So he's redefining truth and subjectivity, the individual higher than the universal.

455
00:45:53,799 --> 00:45:57,080
I mean, he's not redefining the terms but their relation.

456
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:02,199
And he's redefining eternity so that eternity is something that happens in time.

457
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,359
And I can't explain all that yet.

458
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:17,320
But the idea is when he's going to use philosophical language, so to speak, against itself to express the Christian revelation.

459
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:18,999
But that means he can talk.

460
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:24,600
We can understand the way he's redefining these words is not completely arbitrary.

461
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:31,159
And therefore, he's got a way to get people to think existentially in his language.

462
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:46,119
That is, to think the philosophical, to think the Judeo-Christian revelation by using these philosophical terms in a new way, making them all seem completely paradoxical.

463
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:54,440
That's how he's going to capture instead of annihilate that tradition he's trying to express.

464
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,879
Okay, that's still general.

465
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,360
Now, finally, let's get to the book.

466
00:46:59,799 --> 00:47:03,320
So here we go, for the last 20 minutes, anyway.

467
00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:05,240
We're going to read Fear and Trembling.

468
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,960
I repeat that it's the hardest book in the course.

469
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,519
I mean, that keeps you from panicking.

470
00:47:10,839 --> 00:47:12,600
But it is hard, all right?

471
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,520
And it's such a peculiar book.

472
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,920
And I'm going to tell you one part of why it's so hard is what it is.

473
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:27,879
It's purposely sort of playing around in this complicated situation.

474
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,520
I'm looking for the title page.

475
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,759
The title page, the really right title page.

476
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,040
Where did they put it?

477
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:38,639
Here it is, right at the front.

478
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:39,279
No wonder.

479
00:47:39,759 --> 00:47:40,719
Why not put it there?

480
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:42,080
On the first page.

481
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:48,080
So, Fear and Trembling, a dialectical lyric by Johannes de Salentio.

482
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,239
That's already a mouthful.

483
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:55,680
That it took me years to teach me Kierkegaard before I even noticed what a weird thing this is.

484
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:59,040
Because dialectical means philosophical.

485
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,080
Plato, really Socrates started dialectic.

486
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:09,119
It means giving, making general statements, thinking of counterexamples, correcting the generalization, and so forth.

487
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:11,520
And lyrics, what are lyrics?

488
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,159
Well, what is lyrical poetry?

489
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:18,720
Lyrical poetry is the expression of the profoundest feelings.

490
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:25,360
So a dialectical lyric is exactly the same kind of contradiction we've been talking about.

491
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:32,320
It's a philosophical treatment, somehow, of the most personal experiences.

492
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:34,000
That's what the book is about.

493
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,079
That's hard enough, but why by Johannes de Salentio?

494
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:49,360
Well, partly because, as I said, he wants to write always from the point of view that will get you to see something as it looks to somebody living that kind of life.

495
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:55,520
But here, it's really not that mainly, but a further amazing complication.

496
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,040
Namely, this is a secret message, this whole book.

497
00:48:59,759 --> 00:49:02,239
You may have read enough of the introduction to know.

498
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:09,359
Kierkegaard in 1850, Denmark, saw this girl, this young, yes, she was pretty young.

499
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,159
I mean, really a girl.

500
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:12,960
I mean, I think she was about 16, maybe.

501
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:21,399
Saw this woman or girl whom he loved at first sight while he was from the terrace of the cafe where he hung out and read and wrote.

502
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:26,839
After a few, I don't know, months of this, I haven't followed this gossip in much detail.

503
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:31,959
There are endless books written, starting by Kierkegaard, who's written endless stories about this.

504
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:38,520
He finally runs up and proposes to Regina, and they actually get engaged.

505
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:46,040
And then he realizes that somehow, and then more books of gossip, because nobody knows quite why, he can't marry Regina.

506
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,080
What's the problem?

507
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:48,519
Who knows?

508
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:55,159
He has a thorn in his flesh, he says in his journals, and then he tears out some pages where he tells us what the thorn was.

509
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,519
I have theories about it, which I'll come back to.

510
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:05,240
But the main thing is, he breaks his engagement with Regina, which is a big deal in 1850 Denmark.

511
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,560
So he goes into total shock.

512
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:12,840
He goes into total shock and runs off to Berlin and writes three books, of which this is one of them.

513
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:17,720
All of them, his sort of attempt to get a grip on what has happened.

514
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:19,719
And this is a book to Regina.

515
00:50:19,719 --> 00:50:33,159
And Kierkegaard is trying to tell her that he's a knight of resignation, that he's trying to be a knight of faith, and that she should wait and not get married to anybody else, because somehow they'll get back together again anyway.

516
00:50:33,159 --> 00:50:38,999
And then she married some bourgeois named Schlegel, and Kierkegaard went into more shock and wrote more books.

517
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:47,080
And the whole relationship seems to me pathetic.

518
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:55,719
But what's amazing about philosophers is out of these completely sick experiences, they find deep, deep truths.

519
00:50:55,719 --> 00:51:10,319
Kierkegaard has a deeper understanding of romantic love, and through it, of the Judeo-Christian tradition, out of this sordid mess of getting engaged to Regina and breaking the engagement, but not really wanting her to marry anybody else, and blah, blah, blah.

520
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:13,920
He got this very, very, very important book.

521
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,760
The other two are harder to understand than this, if you could believe it.

522
00:51:17,759 --> 00:51:20,000
Okay, so now what is he going to do here?

523
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:24,800
He's going to write a book in which he thinks about his profoundest experience.

524
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:32,319
He's going to write it as a code that he's going to write it for her, and only she'll understand it.

525
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:37,679
That's why on page 39, where you get another version of the title page, he has this little thing.

526
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:43,600
What Tarquin the Proud said in his garden with the poppy blossoms was understood by the sun, but not by the messenger.

527
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,439
That's just a question about codes.

528
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:56,880
The guy, Tarquin, cuts, knocks off the heads of the poppies as he's walking along with the messenger, and his followers understand that that needs to kill the messenger.

529
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,040
But it's not that that's important.

530
00:51:59,040 --> 00:51:59,600
It's important.

531
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,999
That little quote just says it's code.

532
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,079
Only the person for whom it's meant will understand it.

533
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:12,000
And now, so let's see.

534
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,840
So he's keeping silent, yeah.

535
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:32,720
Okay, so let's now look.

536
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:44,920
Remember, I said that every existentialist has this one sort of basic revealing experience, and that they're writing out of this experience, and they're trying to understand the implications of this experience.

537
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,439
And they're not going to tell you anywhere exactly what it is.

538
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,960
It's sort of too basic and too pervasive.

539
00:52:52,199 --> 00:53:10,920
So, Kierkegaard's way of dealing with this, the experience with Regina, is to make it a story about something of which romantic love is just an example, but which I will call sort of unconditional commitment.

540
00:53:11,239 --> 00:53:21,880
And what an unconditional commitment is and what it requires, and so forth, is what this whole book is about.

541
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:31,400
And it's Abraham's got an unconditional commitment to becoming the father of the faith, it turns out.

542
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:39,399
And the question is, and he's asked to kill Isaac, which is the way to get to be the father of the faith.

543
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,880
So, Abraham's got a big problem.

544
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:47,319
It's not a problem, as it says on the back of the, not of the translation.

545
00:53:47,319 --> 00:53:48,440
I mean, there's the same chance.

546
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,199
No, it isn't on the back of your book, I don't think.

547
00:53:52,279 --> 00:53:53,319
See, I've got your book.

548
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,999
But it's the same translation.

549
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,119
But let me see.

550
00:53:56,119 --> 00:53:57,639
Does it say it?

551
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,080
No, it's better here.

552
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:14,680
It talks on the back of mine, older one, Abraham's unreserved submission to God's will provides the focus for this religious and ethical polemic.

553
00:54:14,679 --> 00:54:22,119
It's true that Abraham is told that he has to sacrifice Isaac, and that gives him a lot of problems.

554
00:54:22,119 --> 00:54:32,480
But it wouldn't give him all his problems if Isaac wasn't the absolute commitment for Abraham in the sense that it's Abraham understands himself as becoming the father of the faith.

555
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:36,319
God has promised him that, and Isaac is the way he's going to do it.

556
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:58,800
So, the problem is obeying God means somehow losing that object which makes it possible for you to give the meaning to your life and give you your identity and being able to lose that object and somehow still keep it.

557
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:10,879
Recognize that's why this is the Regina story turned around into the God's relation to Isaac is now like Kierkegaard's relation to Regina, and God's got to sacrifice Isaac.

558
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:17,920
Well, Kierkegaard's got to sacrifice Regina, and yet somehow Kierkegaard thinks that he's going to get her back, and that's just crazy.

559
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:27,840
But Abraham also somehow knows that he's going to sacrifice Isaac, and yet knows that he's not going to lose Isaac.

560
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:32,480
And that's just so weird that it takes a lot of discussion.

561
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:47,680
But what I want to start with, the thing to do when you're reading a book like this is find out where the basic experience is that everything is based on.

562
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,040
Okay, it's on the bottom of page 70.

563
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,639
And put in a funny way.

564
00:56:05,759 --> 00:56:10,959
He's talking about nights of faith and nights of infinite resignation, but don't worry about that yet.

565
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,080
The first thing you got to understand is what the experience is.

566
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:20,520
And the experience is starting three lines from the bottom of page 70.

567
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:23,320
A young lad falls in love with a princess.

568
00:56:23,639 --> 00:56:27,319
The content of his whole life lies in this love.

569
00:56:27,639 --> 00:56:29,639
That's the crucial line already.

570
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:32,360
That's the unconditional commitment.

571
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:38,920
He gets his whole identity, what's important to him and what isn't, in terms of this relationship.

572
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,960
I sometimes call it a defining relationship.

573
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:52,199
The unconditional commitment is a defining relationship in that it's some commitment to somebody or some cause, we'll see in a minute.

574
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:59,639
It doesn't have to be a person, but something that gives you your understanding of who you are, what matters in your life.

575
00:56:59,639 --> 00:57:01,159
So let's go on.

576
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:03,399
It turns out that it's impossible.

577
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,320
It can't be brought to fruition.

578
00:57:05,319 --> 00:57:15,720
That means that something always stands in the way of this kind of unconditional commitment.

579
00:57:15,719 --> 00:57:19,559
There's something basically wrong with it, to have it.

580
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,800
Now, can you see what that is?

581
00:57:21,799 --> 00:57:34,999
Why would it be somehow something you might say a kind of terrible mistake to have a defining commitment to a particular person or a particular cause?

582
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:37,000
What could happen?

583
00:57:37,639 --> 00:57:41,159
They give you the whole meaning of your life and your world.

584
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,679
Well, they might die.

585
00:57:44,679 --> 00:57:46,200
They might leave.

586
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,879
They might love somebody else, or your cause.

587
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:53,480
Let's generalize it right away to another.

588
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,999
Because it doesn't have to be a person.

589
00:57:55,560 --> 00:58:05,759
If this was only about romantic love, it would be a lot less interesting and a lot less general and a lot less basic for our history in the West than he wants it to be.

590
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:08,639
At the bottom of 71, you get a footnote.

591
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:20,959
Of course, any other interest whatsoever in which an individual concentrates the whole of life's reality can, when it proves unrealizability, give rise to resignation and so forth.

592
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,159
Never mind the rest.

593
00:58:22,159 --> 00:58:24,080
The point is anything.

594
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:40,320
So take, I mean, just to take another example, very timely, Martin Luther King's commitment to the justice for the black people requires that when he has his peace marches, that the white people come out and march along.

595
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:45,040
If they didn't, at some point, the whole mission would just fail.

596
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:49,679
And he would be lost as far as having a understanding.

597
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,200
This would be like losing the person you love.

598
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:56,319
Where would he be if that was the whole meaning of his life?

599
00:58:56,319 --> 00:59:08,159
If that was in Kierkegaard jargon, the content of his whole life was tied up in the peace movement, not peace movement, justice for the black movement.

600
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,919
What's the slogan?

601
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,439
The civil rights movement.

602
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:12,480
Good.

603
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:12,959
Okay.

604
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:17,919
And you can lose with movements.

605
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:18,639
You can do something.

606
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:24,159
I don't know if you can do with people, it just occurs to me, but with movements, you can lose by winning.

607
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:35,320
That is, as long as every day when Martin Luther King wakes up, in his world, it's clear what's relevant and irrelevant, what's important and not, what he should do and not do.

608
00:59:35,319 --> 00:59:39,680
It's all always goes back to what is going to help the civil rights movement.

609
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:43,040
And it doesn't matter whether it risks his life or not.

610
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:49,080
But once he's got the civil rights movement sort of surely marching along, he's seen, you know, he's been on the mountain.

611
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,519
I've just been hearing all these wonderful talks.

612
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:57,880
He's been on the mountain, he's seen the promised land, and he's sort of achieved his goal.

613
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:05,080
He kind of lost, and he then turns to be against the Vietnam War, but that doesn't seem like his really his vocation.

614
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:07,879
His vocation was the civil rights movement.

615
01:00:08,119 --> 01:00:12,920
The defining commitment has got to give you something to do.

616
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:17,080
Now let's use Kierkegaard jargon in the finite and the temporal.

617
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:25,399
That is, every moment you've always know what specific thing is important to do and not.

618
01:00:25,719 --> 01:00:32,119
And if you lose the civil rights movement, you will not know who you are and what to do, and you will be in grief.

619
01:00:32,119 --> 01:00:37,080
And in a certain peculiar way, if you win it, you won't know who you are, you'll be in grief.

620
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:43,720
That's not the characteristic of romantic love, but that's the characteristic of what Kierkegaard really.

621
01:00:43,719 --> 01:00:45,639
See, this is what I'm trying to tell you.

622
01:00:45,639 --> 01:01:06,920
I mean, out of this sorted affair with Regina comes the first deep understanding of the relation of the lad and the princess, and even more, this deep understanding of being unconditionally committed to any finite, specific, vulnerable something or other.

623
01:01:07,239 --> 01:01:09,639
And that's what he's really interested in.

624
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:14,439
And all the puzzles of the book come from how do you deal with it?

625
01:01:14,839 --> 01:01:17,879
But I interrupted something else I was saying, so let me go back to it.

626
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:27,800
So, what's wrong with having a commitment to a person or a cause, which gives you your identity, tells you who you are and what to do?

627
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,680
What's wrong with it?

628
01:01:31,319 --> 01:01:31,799
Yeah.

629
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,000
Well.

630
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,040
Okay.

631
01:01:55,839 --> 01:02:09,279
I want to put that, but that's not wrong at all, but I want to put it aside till later, because it seems to me that's going to come up under the ethical issue about how philosophy has to play a role in this to keep this from becoming an obsession.

632
01:02:09,279 --> 01:02:18,559
To keep this, he talks about it, he wants it not to be fanatical, not to be, and yet you're ready to die for it, and how can it be not fanatical?

633
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:20,000
Well, we're going to get to that.

634
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:26,720
But there's something before that, which is, and I'm not, you all see it so obviously, I think you just aren't saying it.

635
01:02:26,719 --> 01:02:38,000
If you put the whole meaning of your life onto somebody or some cause which is finite and temporal, it's fragile.

636
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,360
It's vulnerable.

637
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,440
And you're completely vulnerable.

638
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:50,320
You're setting yourself up for a meaningless life and grief and no sense of who you are or what to do.

639
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:54,880
Nobody in their right mind would get involved in such a thing.

640
01:02:54,880 --> 01:03:03,440
And now, and that's the sense that for everybody, the relationship is, in a certain sense, impossible.

641
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:08,639
It's not just that the lad can't have the princess because he's not of the royal family.

642
01:03:08,639 --> 01:03:13,920
It's not with the Kierkegaard can't have Regina for whatever reason, which we never really find out.

643
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:23,880
It's that there's something paradoxical and impossible, he sometimes says, about getting involved in this kind of relationship.

644
01:03:24,199 --> 01:03:26,839
And the question is: how is it possible?

645
01:03:26,839 --> 01:03:34,519
How can anybody do it once they really have enough imagination and reflection to see what they're getting into?

646
01:03:34,839 --> 01:03:44,920
Wouldn't it be better if they, once they were in it, they saw this big risk, and what could they do about it?

647
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,440
What could they do?

648
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,359
Well, the Knight of Resignation knows what to do.

649
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,600
Well, you tell me, what would you do?

650
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:56,679
Kierkegaard says that would be terrible.

651
01:03:56,679 --> 01:04:03,560
That would be to become like what he calls the lower natures, like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly.

652
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:06,440
You wouldn't have any sense of who you were.

653
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:08,360
You'd lose your identity.

654
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:17,240
You'd be sort of falling below this sort of capacity people had for this higher meaning.

655
01:04:17,239 --> 01:04:19,159
So let's not try that.

656
01:04:27,319 --> 01:04:35,320
Ah, well, it would be worse than what they can do, which is not grief, and not giving it up.

657
01:04:35,319 --> 01:04:36,679
There's something else.

658
01:04:36,679 --> 01:04:39,480
I just want to give you one more term so you'll know what you're doing when you're reading.

659
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:40,840
Then we have to stop.

660
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:52,519
Infinite resignation, the night of infinite resignation, which is what Kierkegaard thinks he's writing from the position of, does something like this.

661
01:04:52,839 --> 01:05:09,360
They say, this relationship was the most beautiful, most meaningful thing in my life, and I'm going to stay committed to it, but I'm only going to be committed to the meaning of it, so that I don't need the other person actually around.

662
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,639
So I give up in Kierkegaard jargon the finite and the temporal.

663
01:05:14,639 --> 01:05:25,839
I resign myself to not having the other person around day by day, but I preserve my relationship in the ideal, as he puts it sometimes.

664
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:34,959
That is, I have this perfect memory of what it means, and I keep that alive and young, as he puts it.

665
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,440
He has all kinds of lyrical ways to talk about it.

666
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:47,999
But it's safe because you're invulnerable if it's the meaning of the relation and not the other person that you're defined by.

667
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:52,239
Okay, now all those, I just sort of threw out a lot of the sort of issues and terms.

668
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:58,159
Now, when you read it, you won't be completely lost, I hope, though there's still lots more to get clear about.
