1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Now, like usual, I like to begin with some kind of puzzle.

2
00:00:05,281 --> 00:00:06,960
Maybe I choose movies for this.

3
00:00:06,961 --> 00:00:09,400
Remember in Hiroshima Wanomura, it was what it was.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,640
Do you remember anything, or no, you don't remember anything?

5
00:00:12,641 --> 00:00:15,680
And it was, well, never mind.

6
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:16,320
Let's start with this.

7
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:17,760
There's not enough time to go back.

8
00:00:18,081 --> 00:00:23,800
The puzzle in this one is: why does Michelle call Patricia de Gu Las?

9
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:28,680
Which gets translated in some stupid way, as I recall in the subtitles.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,441
What does he say to her at the end?

11
00:00:30,441 --> 00:00:32,520
And what do they translate that as?

12
00:00:32,841 --> 00:00:33,481
What?

13
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:34,921
Scumbag, right?

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,121
That's just ridiculous.

15
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:39,001
It's either something like revolting or disgusting.

16
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:43,721
I mean, it's not totally wrong, but I think he says you're disgusting.

17
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:50,360
And the policeman interprets that as, you're a little bitch.

18
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,081
Is that right?

19
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,921
I think he says, I guess that's all right.

20
00:00:54,921 --> 00:01:00,040
But the question is, why does he say that to her?

21
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,561
And tell me first, what's the obvious answer?

22
00:01:03,561 --> 00:01:06,441
Which is going to be wrong, but it's important to know what it is.

23
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:09,640
Why would he be thinking she was disgusting?

24
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,080
Has she done anything awful?

25
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,960
Yeah.

26
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:19,001
He says, it's disgusting.

27
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:19,880
That's good.

28
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,360
That's why scumbag couldn't be the right translation.

29
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:24,281
No, he says, say, degu las.

30
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:25,721
It's disgusting.

31
00:01:25,721 --> 00:01:30,841
But it turns out that it's something she's done that's disgusting.

32
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,800
I think everybody just agrees about that.

33
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,640
We'll have to go back.

34
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,401
Whoever's watching the movie, you better go back.

35
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:43,961
And you know French, if you watch the movie, will you be able to tell us what exactly they say?

36
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:56,520
Because it would complicate things if he said it's disgusting, because then you'd have to make a further interpreting move to see that it's her, but I'm pretty sure it is her.

37
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,681
And the policeman, you can't trust them very much, but say it's her.

38
00:02:01,241 --> 00:02:06,640
And there's every, I mean, the story I'm going to tell you makes it clear that it's got to be her.

39
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,360
But it would be nice if the movie was caught up with my interpretation on this point.

40
00:02:11,681 --> 00:02:19,441
So, but anyway, what would be the obvious reason for telling her that she's disgusting?

41
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,200
He ratted him out.

42
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,081
He turned him in.

43
00:02:22,721 --> 00:02:24,480
That's pretty disgusting, isn't it?

44
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,200
But that's not the reason at all.

45
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,480
I guarantee it.

46
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,641
By the time we get there, you will agree with me that that is not the reason.

47
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,081
Then we've got a long way to go.

48
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,601
So let's start.

49
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,801
So we're going to start by talking about Michelle Poitard.

50
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:44,001
And all through this, I'm going to tell you when it's Nietzsche, and that you'll see.

51
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:47,361
But I'm not going to, but first, we've just got to pay attention to the movie.

52
00:02:47,361 --> 00:02:51,280
So the question is: why is Michelle so attractive?

53
00:02:51,281 --> 00:02:58,721
After all, he's just a punk who kills a policeman, steals money from his ex-girlfriend in the most disgusting way.

54
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,920
When she tries to, you remember, tries to loan him the money.

55
00:03:01,921 --> 00:03:04,481
He uses that to find out where the money is.

56
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,681
And then while she's putting on her dress, he steals the money, then offers to take her to breakfast with her money.

57
00:03:09,681 --> 00:03:20,640
And he just, so he shows that this girlfriend trusts him, he betrays her, and so forth.

58
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:29,441
I mean, he is not, if you describe him, objectively, and he spends plenty of time when he's not doing anything else looking at pinoff pictures in the Gurley magazine.

59
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:32,961
That's what you see first when you see him stealing a car.

60
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,640
And of course he steals cars.

61
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,040
I forgot to even put that on my list.

62
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:41,121
So, and yet, now here's already a controversial point.

63
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:42,481
I don't know about you all.

64
00:03:42,481 --> 00:03:44,241
I think he's very attractive.

65
00:03:44,241 --> 00:03:47,520
I mean, I think the movie wouldn't work if he wasn't very attractive.

66
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:54,601
But when I said this the last time I taught the course, there was a general revolt, mostly from the women, that he wasn't attractive at all.

67
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,601
You want to say something about this?

68
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,441
I thought you said, I mean, I mean, he's, I mean, if he is attractive, I mean, do you think he's attractive?

69
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:03,880
Yeah, I do too.

70
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,481
I don't know what happened last time.

71
00:04:06,441 --> 00:04:10,681
He's attractive, he's physically and for his personality.

72
00:04:10,681 --> 00:04:11,720
He's an ex-boxer.

73
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,241
It's the first movie.

74
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,520
Godard just found him.

75
00:04:15,001 --> 00:04:18,601
He goes through this boxing routine every once in a while, and he looks great.

76
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:23,400
Anyway, so, but that's what's attractive about, I think, is his style.

77
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,521
That he does everything with flair, with cheerfulness, with intensity.

78
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,880
Those ought to sound particular, with style, cheerfulness, and intensity.

79
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:34,681
That sounds niche.

80
00:04:34,681 --> 00:04:40,361
And if you ask, what is it about Bogart that he's devoted to?

81
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:53,161
Because remember, the one thing he looks at as if maybe you couldn't even laugh at it, I don't know, that doesn't come up, but with a kind of reverence, is the picture of Bogie.

82
00:04:53,161 --> 00:04:57,640
And what does Bogey have that he admires, presumably?

83
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:00,041
I presume it's style.

84
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:04,361
I presume that there's a bogey style, that he's got the same style in all his movies.

85
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:06,760
It's kind of cool that he's got.

86
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,921
It's certainly not the principles he stands for or how he looks.

87
00:05:10,921 --> 00:05:13,001
I mean, physically looks.

88
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:17,880
So he's got style, and I think he admires style.

89
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,241
And he's also ready to live dangerously just to the end.

90
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:27,721
Remember, I stressed that quote in The Gay Science.

91
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:53,600
What he says is, as he's driving the stolen car, never use the brake, and at a certain moment, a poster behind him at the movie theater says, The poster in French reads, live dangerously until the end, which is exactly what Nietzsche says.

92
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:05,200
I believe that the movie, the subtitles, are completely different because you see the marquee of the movie theater, and it's got some movie title on it.

93
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,561
And you see the poster, which says Live Dangerously just the end.

94
00:06:08,561 --> 00:06:13,840
And the stupid people who are doing the subtitles translate what's on the marquee instead of what's on the poster.

95
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,640
So you didn't see Live Dangerously just to the end, I don't believe.

96
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:24,641
But it's certainly important because that's sort of the Nietzsche stamp on the movie.

97
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,041
I mean, that's supposed to alert you to something that could have been any old poster.

98
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,641
It was any old marquee.

99
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,441
But it turns out that it's absolutely crucial.

100
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:35,760
It's his way of life.

101
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,601
But though he's intense, he's cool.

102
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,681
That's the bogey side.

103
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:51,600
That you can see in his contrast with the sweaty, panicky seriousness of the cops when they're following Patricia around, for instance, and he's following them around.

104
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:55,281
They're frantic and he's cool.

105
00:06:55,921 --> 00:06:58,481
And that just makes him look all the cooler.

106
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:07,921
Now, there's another important thing about him, a passage which I intended to read last time, but didn't, because I didn't see my notes on it.

107
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:15,521
He's also egotistical, egoism, meaning selfish.

108
00:07:15,521 --> 00:07:19,441
He takes whatever he wants, and he does whatever he desires.

109
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:28,200
Now, and that, you might think, was not an attractive trait, but Nietzsche thinks it's an attractive trait.

110
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:35,001
Now I'm on page 258 of the gay science, aphorism 328.

111
00:07:35,641 --> 00:07:48,281
Surely the faith preached so stubbornly and with so much conviction that egoism is reprehensible has on the whole harmed egoism while benefiting, as I shall repeat a hundred times, the herd instincts.

112
00:07:48,281 --> 00:07:51,801
Above all, by depriving egoism of its good conscience.

113
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,480
He's got perfectly good conscience.

114
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,761
It doesn't bother him that he's stealing the girl's money.

115
00:07:56,761 --> 00:08:04,041
It doesn't bother him that whatever he wants from Patricia, he just says he wants it and insists and insists until he gets it.

116
00:08:04,681 --> 00:08:15,961
And so it deprives egoism, good conscience, and bids us to find it and bids us to find in egoism the source of unhappiness.

117
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,641
Quote, your selfishness is the misfortune of your life.

118
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:31,001
That was preached for thousands of years and harmed, as I have said, selfishness and deprived it of much spirit, much cheerfulness, much sensitivity, much beauty.

119
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,841
Egoism is just another good thing about him.

120
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:41,480
He does everything for his own happiness, but he doesn't think about himself.

121
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:47,320
He just spontaneously and instinctively goes after whatever he wants.

122
00:08:48,281 --> 00:08:51,801
Then it's important that he's got this kind of spontaneity.

123
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:52,921
He never reflects.

124
00:08:52,921 --> 00:08:54,041
He doesn't think.

125
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:57,401
He does on whatever his impulses tell him.

126
00:08:57,401 --> 00:08:59,801
What's the most funny impulsive thing he does?

127
00:08:59,801 --> 00:09:00,761
Do you remember?

128
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,881
Who's my, like my remember, picking up the girl's skirt, right?

129
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,521
He says, Well, it'd be nice to pick up that girl's skirt.

130
00:09:07,521 --> 00:09:11,921
And she says, Be my guest, that he runs out of the stops the cab and runs out and does it.

131
00:09:11,921 --> 00:09:20,641
Well, that's a kind of cheerful, peculiar, impulsiveness that's very attractive about him.

132
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:29,840
But the most important thing about him, not all those things, but for us, anyway, reading it, I don't think it's something Patricia appreciates.

133
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,600
I'm not sure that any of these traits are what she appreciates about him.

134
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,521
We'll have to worry about that later.

135
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:42,641
But what's interesting about him is he invents, keeps inventing and reinventing his life.

136
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,921
If you ask yourself, who is Michelle Poitard?

137
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,401
What do we know about him?

138
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:56,401
Well, we only know one thing, I think, that he was a steward on Air France.

139
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:59,361
That's his connection with that travel agency.

140
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,640
And who never mentions that he was, I think.

141
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:04,640
The police, that's right, the police mention it.

142
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:09,521
For him, this is a very boring identity, one that he doesn't even care about.

143
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,921
And what other identities does he have?

144
00:10:11,921 --> 00:10:19,760
Well, besides that, we find out, and that's, well, let me just say that again, that's everyday reality.

145
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,361
That's a boring job.

146
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,561
And Nietzsche says he should be an outlaw.

147
00:10:24,561 --> 00:10:27,601
And in fact, he's an outlaw.

148
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:34,081
And in this vacuum of how he invents himself a completely glamorous life.

149
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,521
I mean, we don't know what his parents really did, presumably something boring.

150
00:10:37,521 --> 00:10:42,721
But he has a grandfather with a Rolls-Royce who never opened the hood in 15 years.

151
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,681
He had a time in the Army where his job was to slit the throats of the sentries.

152
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:50,121
He was an assistant movie director in Nice.

153
00:10:50,681 --> 00:10:58,441
He had a habit of staying at the Claridge Hotel, which is like the Ritz, and selling, he sold used cars in New York.

154
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:01,081
And his father was a famous clarinetist.

155
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:16,041
I mean, all those are possible lives and possible identities which he just invents in the space of the presumably completely boring life and completely boring family and background that he really has.

156
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:18,841
And I'm just listing all these things.

157
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:27,641
So far I've said that he has style, that he's cool, that he's egoistic, spontaneous, invents his life.

158
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,320
And the last one, irreverent.

159
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,921
Remember, you can laugh at anything.

160
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:39,481
I think for the first time teaching it this time around, I don't know whether he can laugh at Bogart.

161
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,441
I think not.

162
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:46,601
I think that's somehow part of the kind of identity he's got.

163
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:53,721
But everything else, remember there's a little irreverent thing which fits in perfectly with this.

164
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:01,961
When the guy gets hit by a car and is lying there on the street and they're looking and then they discover that he's really dead, what does he do?

165
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,041
He, what?

166
00:12:04,681 --> 00:12:07,320
Well, first he does one thing before he starts to read the newspaper.

167
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,761
He crosses himself.

168
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,481
I mean, that's taking, that's the irreverence toward things that other people take seriously.

169
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:18,041
That's in the gay sciences.

170
00:12:18,041 --> 00:14:10,521
I read this, but it so fits him that I'll read it again on page 347 where at the end of Aphorism 382, he the the the the this is the uh um free spirit confronts all earthly seriousness so far all solemnity in gesture word tone eye morality and task so far as if they were as if it at him were their most incarnate involuntary parody that's the what he's up to and she later talks about Romeo and Juliet and he says oh that's a silly woman's idea I mean there insofar as anything comes up that's serious he he's ready to parody it or poo-poo it let's see what else and of course the weirdest thing in the movie for this of making of not taking seriously something that people have normally taken seriously is well whatever it is what's happening between them in that hotel room that long long scene which is just surprise after surprise and absolutely unbanal and is that a seduction scene I mean well the sex plays some kind of role in it but it seems to be all sort of like a joke where love and desire and passion and sex none of them are taken seriously it ends with them under the sheets and the radio saying now work to music and then they just reach out and turn out the radio but it's there's never anything like a normal serious movie or real life relation between them.

171
00:14:10,521 --> 00:14:12,921
And that's fine.

172
00:14:19,161 --> 00:14:27,241
And one of the other ways you can see that he doesn't want us to take anything seriously is the funny faces he makes at her.

173
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:35,721
That he starts making them in the mirror, the other girl, the nice girlfriend's place where the movie begins, but he makes them for her too.

174
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,320
His fait le girl in French, it means to make faces.

175
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,521
And it's sort of, it's not keeping a straight face, you could say.

176
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,681
He doesn't keep a straight face about anything.

177
00:14:46,681 --> 00:14:48,761
It's the seriousness again.

178
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:59,641
And this making of this face, of course, comes back at the very end of the movie, where he again does those grimaces, those three grimaces.

179
00:15:00,521 --> 00:15:03,161
Okay, so that's the irreverent.

180
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:04,761
Now, there's still more.

181
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:10,681
So he seems also to be in the brief habit form of acting.

182
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:19,480
When she talks about Romeo and Juliet on 72, I put this on reserve.

183
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,520
This is the scenario.

184
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,200
Some of you have it, I see.

185
00:15:22,441 --> 00:15:24,921
Some of you don't, because I said I recommended it.

186
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:28,841
She at the bottom of 72 says, I wish I were Romeo.

187
00:15:28,841 --> 00:15:30,760
I wish we were Romeo and Juliet.

188
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,280
And he says, oh, la la, what a girlish idea.

189
00:15:35,161 --> 00:15:36,841
And then they go on, which is interesting.

190
00:15:36,841 --> 00:15:42,681
You said, she says, you see, you said last night in the car, you couldn't live without me, but you can.

191
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,320
Romeo couldn't live without Juliet, but you can, you can.

192
00:15:47,641 --> 00:15:52,121
And he sort of says, no, I can't live without you.

193
00:15:52,121 --> 00:15:56,200
And she says, oh, la la la, now that's just a boyish idea, and so forth.

194
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,441
So they're making fun of unconditional commitment.

195
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:08,161
But they are saying that for the time being, that he's saying, I can't, I mean, you are my brief habit, he's saying to her.

196
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:11,121
Right now, I can't be happy with anybody else.

197
00:16:11,121 --> 00:16:14,081
Remember, he says, I don't, I think it's, it used to be translated.

198
00:16:14,081 --> 00:16:16,720
See, I've seen it in the different with different subtitles.

199
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,360
And I had to go to this meeting, so I didn't see this one.

200
00:16:19,361 --> 00:16:24,560
But does he say it doesn't click with anybody but her when he's talking to one of his friends?

201
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,481
I don't know what the French is for that, and I don't know what your translation is.

202
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,760
But right now, it's working with her.

203
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,240
He's really happy to be with her.

204
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,560
He's not happy to be with anybody else.

205
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:47,681
Not even that very beautiful and lovely and hard-working girl that offers to loan him the money and seems to be in love with him or at least one of his ex-girlfriends.

206
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,600
None of that matters.

207
00:16:49,601 --> 00:16:58,401
But I take it, he's not going to say he's got an unconditional commitment to her, that she gives him his identity or anything like that.

208
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,280
He can't do without her.

209
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:13,041
But what it is about her that makes her so special for him that did I see, no, I written here, why does it only click with her?

210
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,800
Why can't he do without her?

211
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,040
Well, he said he can do without her.

212
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,161
I think that's a mistake.

213
00:17:18,161 --> 00:17:18,801
That's the point.

214
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:24,161
She's complaining, and rightly, that he's not defining himself and his world in terms of her.

215
00:17:24,161 --> 00:17:26,401
He's not doing that with anybody.

216
00:17:26,401 --> 00:17:31,921
So, get rid of that.

217
00:17:31,921 --> 00:17:32,560
Okay.

218
00:17:32,881 --> 00:17:37,441
And finally, but to sum up all this, or no, it doesn't sum up all this.

219
00:17:37,441 --> 00:17:38,641
It's just another one.

220
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,401
But it's related to all these.

221
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:43,681
He has a positive interest in nothingness.

222
00:17:43,681 --> 00:17:45,841
That should be an important clue.

223
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:47,921
He's not afraid of death.

224
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:49,360
He says he's fascinated by it.

225
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:58,280
He says he thinks about death constantly, and at one point he even pretends happily to be dead in Patricia's lap.

226
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,000
And it just makes life more interesting.

227
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,681
Death is close to him throughout the film, and it doesn't frighten him a bit, and it doesn't make life meaningless for him.

228
00:18:09,161 --> 00:18:21,480
He contrasts that with The Stranger, which a lot of you have read, you said, where Mirceau's life becomes meaningless in the face of the cold wind blowing from the future, that is, his death.

229
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:32,361
Whereas, until the very end of the book, where he understands, too, that death gives life a kind of poignancy, that Michelle understands that all the time.

230
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:41,480
Since everything is meaningless and nothing frightens him, he's open to everything.

231
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,240
He appreciates everything.

232
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:58,121
And you get this funny list when he's driving the car at the beginning, and he says, if you don't love the sun, he just says, I love the sun, I forget how it goes, and France, and the streets, and France.

233
00:18:58,121 --> 00:19:06,441
And then he also says he loves the old neighborhoods when they're driving by that fancy new apartment building by the Jardin du Luxembourg.

234
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:11,240
And he says, Isn't it beautiful, the Place de la Concorde at night?

235
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,441
All of these things.

236
00:19:12,441 --> 00:19:19,880
He's really open to appreciate them, but appreciate them just in a passing sort of way.

237
00:19:19,881 --> 00:19:21,960
He's open to them all equally.

238
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,000
He doesn't make a big deal about any of them.

239
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:27,641
He's very observant, by the way.

240
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:30,360
Just this will sort of interest you if you see it again.

241
00:19:30,361 --> 00:19:40,800
He notices the man who recognizes him from the newspaper picture as he's sitting in the car in front of the Herald Tribune waiting for Patricia.

242
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:43,120
It's an interesting one.

243
00:19:43,121 --> 00:19:44,481
I can make three points about that.

244
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,560
One, he's observant and he sees it happen.

245
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,921
That's not a big deal.

246
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:50,881
Two, just for your information, that's Godard.

247
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:55,921
Godard has put himself in the movie the way Hitchcock always put himself in his movies.

248
00:19:55,921 --> 00:20:01,441
Godard is the one who sees in the paper that this was really the guy they're looking for.

249
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:13,361
But more important to us, since he's not afraid of death and he cares about Patricia right now, he doesn't, when he notices that he's been recognized and this guy's obviously going to go out and call the police, he doesn't leave.

250
00:20:13,361 --> 00:20:15,520
He's not going to leave because he's waiting for her.

251
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,401
And that's what he happens to care about right then.

252
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,720
So now we're going to sum up Michelle's way of being.

253
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,840
And that is, he's an active nihilist.

254
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:35,760
In the breakdown of all values, he's happily reinventing himself and reinventing worlds.

255
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,120
And this is so that the breakdown of everything is a source of joy for him.

256
00:20:41,121 --> 00:20:44,401
It's an occasion for him to be creative.

257
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:52,240
If he had some famous father and grandfather, that would be bad news because then he couldn't invent all these other lives for himself.

258
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,040
He'd have some important identity.

259
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:01,120
But he takes this lack of any important identity as a great thing.

260
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:14,000
It's a positive freedom to cheerfully invent and reinvent his life to get presumably a whole series of brief habits of which he's happily enjoying this one.

261
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:27,641
Now, Godard talks about the movie in this, and what he says is sometimes very interesting.

262
00:21:27,641 --> 00:21:29,641
And it's very Nietzschean.

263
00:21:29,641 --> 00:21:32,040
Again, a clue, I think.

264
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,441
He says, the genre of Breathless was such that all was permitted.

265
00:21:36,441 --> 00:21:37,880
That was its nature.

266
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:39,080
Sounds familiar.

267
00:21:39,081 --> 00:21:42,760
Whatever people might do, all this could be integrated into the film.

268
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,760
This was even my point of departure.

269
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:50,040
I said to myself, we've had Hiroshima, a certain kind of cinema has ended.

270
00:21:50,441 --> 00:21:56,280
That was a very serious, coherent, well-made movie.

271
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,280
He says, that's ended.

272
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:02,361
Well, then, I think, I said, let's put the final period to it.

273
00:22:02,361 --> 00:22:04,760
Let's show that anything goes.

274
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,560
And that's true.

275
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,401
Incidentally, I wrote in the margin, for instance, no credits.

276
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:18,840
I realized after watching it a few times, you never even see Jane Steberg.

277
00:22:19,321 --> 00:22:20,041
Is that her name?

278
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,960
True, the woman, Patricia, yeah.

279
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,401
And you never see Belmondo's name or Godard director, do you?

280
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,441
I believe not.

281
00:22:26,441 --> 00:22:31,800
It just plunges right into the beginning, into the stealing of the car.

282
00:22:32,121 --> 00:22:40,441
And there's another way it plays around with what seems Godard now.

283
00:22:40,441 --> 00:22:57,240
Remember, I'm trying to say that Michelle is obviously somebody Godard is creating, and he belongs in a movie that expresses the same sort of freedom and anything goes and irreverence and style that he does.

284
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,921
So he says, he says he's done all kinds of interesting things.

285
00:23:02,921 --> 00:23:08,480
He says he's bringing de Gaulle and Eisenhower into the movie as an international backdrop.

286
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:17,520
Somebody says, oh, this is a critic saying, he brings de Gaulle and Eisenhower into the movie as an international backdrop to a petty, low-life drama.

287
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:30,800
So he thought himself the first to drop the names of Renoir and Faulkner, the first to show Picasso the lovers, the first to play disrespectfully, offhandedly with art.

288
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:38,320
So he's doing all these things which that critic thinks he may not really have been the first, but he claimed to be the first.

289
00:23:38,321 --> 00:23:45,760
He claimed to be sort of breaking out of the normal, standard, serious way of doing movies.

290
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,200
Okay, so much for Michelle.

291
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,681
Now you get a chance to say something if you want to.

292
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,361
Anybody?

293
00:23:51,361 --> 00:23:51,841
Yeah.

294
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:02,641
There's this one part after the girl was talking to Michelle and she said, I hate informers.

295
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,881
And he said, yes, that's very important.

296
00:24:06,881 --> 00:24:07,841
I'm going to come back to that.

297
00:24:07,841 --> 00:24:09,840
Lovers love and so forth.

298
00:24:09,841 --> 00:24:13,921
Yeah, that's a kind of nihilistic poetry.

299
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:17,360
That is, there's no real reason for doing anything.

300
00:24:17,361 --> 00:24:21,760
So the only informers inform means, you know, that's just what they do.

301
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,080
And the lovers love, and I forget what else.

302
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,200
We're going to come back to it, but that's just the right thing for him to be saying.

303
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,641
And he says it, according to the script, as a kind of poetry.

304
00:24:32,641 --> 00:24:34,881
That's why I called it nihilistic poetry.

305
00:24:34,881 --> 00:24:35,520
Yeah.

306
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,601
Yes.

307
00:24:43,641 --> 00:24:48,921
I think she said that in order to be successful or have a wonderful life, you have to be selfish.

308
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,520
For instance, the Eskimo say that you have to be yes, right.

309
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:55,881
Yes.

310
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,600
I wish it were as clear as you said it.

311
00:24:58,601 --> 00:24:59,481
You hear her?

312
00:24:59,641 --> 00:25:10,601
She's contrasting the selfish egoism of Michel Pocard with the selflessness that Dostoevsky is recommending.

313
00:25:10,601 --> 00:25:23,560
It's a little trickier than that, in fact, because Nietzsche says in one of the passages I read, but I don't remember which, I couldn't jump to it, that the free spirits are magnanimous and generous in their cheerfulness.

314
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,801
So he's egotistical.

315
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,080
He goes after anything he wants, anything he desires.

316
00:25:29,081 --> 00:25:31,720
He doesn't care about what anybody else wants.

317
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:39,800
But on the other hand, he's not exactly selfish in the sense that he isn't happy to somehow.

318
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:45,000
Do we see it anywhere that he cares about anybody and gives anything to anybody?

319
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,720
Yeah.

320
00:25:46,361 --> 00:25:49,480
The way he drives her around.

321
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,600
Well, of course, with her, he's generous because he cares about her.

322
00:25:54,601 --> 00:26:01,080
He gives a book of matches to the guy who asks him to light the cigarette, but that's not much to like an onion.

323
00:26:01,401 --> 00:26:03,401
But what?

324
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,320
Breakfast?

325
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:06,921
What?

326
00:26:07,881 --> 00:26:09,720
To the girl whose money he stole.

327
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,560
Yeah, that's probably the kind of generous.

328
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,681
He really wanted to buy her breakfast with her money that he stole.

329
00:26:14,681 --> 00:26:15,081
Yes.

330
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:21,001
Well, that's this weird kind of egoism, which is not selfish.

331
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,960
I think it's peculiar.

332
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,401
Anything else?

333
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:28,281
Okay, let's go on to Patricia.

334
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:37,200
In a way, she's, if anything more interesting, if you can find anything more interesting, what's characteristic of her?

335
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,960
Well, let's ask, you know, he's got all these definitions of himself, all these stories he tells.

336
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:49,921
She's got a whole lot of occupations she presumably once had and has dropped.

337
00:26:49,921 --> 00:26:53,360
She's dropped one role after another.

338
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:58,240
She's presumably repudiated her family and country and come to Paris.

339
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,681
She says to study at the Sorbonne, but she doesn't study anything.

340
00:27:01,681 --> 00:27:05,441
She says she's working on a book, but we don't see her writing any book.

341
00:27:05,441 --> 00:27:06,720
She wants to be a reporter.

342
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:14,080
But these are not stories, by the way, she's making up in the way that he's making them up, where he knows they're just inventing possible lives.

343
00:27:14,081 --> 00:27:23,441
These are sort of things that she sort of wishes she was doing, but she's just not committed enough to do any of them or carry them through.

344
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:25,761
So she's working on a book, but she doesn't write any.

345
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,280
She wants to be a reporter.

346
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:32,401
She attends that important press conference, which I'll come back to, that she doesn't write it up.

347
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:43,361
And the wonderful thing is, her job, for which I guess how she supports herself, is the most uncommitted job you could possibly have in the world, selling the Herald Tribune.

348
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:47,921
You just go and you get it, and you pay for it, and you sell it, and you keep the profit.

349
00:27:47,921 --> 00:27:50,161
And you can pick up this job anytime.

350
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:51,841
You can drop this job anytime.

351
00:27:51,841 --> 00:27:55,040
It doesn't require any skills or any qualifications.

352
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,800
She has this sort of minimal identity.

353
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,120
They both have a kind of minimal real identity.

354
00:28:03,121 --> 00:28:05,760
And he makes up all these other identities.

355
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:12,320
And she makes sort of all these other wishes, but she doesn't do anything about them.

356
00:28:12,641 --> 00:28:23,880
You can see already there's something negative about her identity or her occupations in that she doesn't, they're all repudiations of something, her country, her family.

357
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:25,720
And now there's also her gender.

358
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:30,120
She seems, I think, to repudiate her sexuality.

359
00:28:30,121 --> 00:28:35,161
She walks in this awkward, I think, unfeminine sort of way.

360
00:28:35,161 --> 00:28:39,240
She cuts her hair in this severe, short haircut.

361
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,480
She wears Michelle's clothes.

362
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,681
She wears no bra.

363
00:28:42,681 --> 00:28:43,720
He complains about that.

364
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:49,560
These are things that seemed weirder in, I don't know, 50, whatever, when this movie was made.

365
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:58,361
They are sort of non-doing, but they aren't sort of doing something different exactly, for its own sake.

366
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,641
I don't know what they are.

367
00:28:59,641 --> 00:29:14,921
They're just, I see them as just sort of denial of taking on any of the role or jobs that being a woman in France in 1960 or whenever it was requires.

368
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,401
And then she says she's pregnant, but then she drops that issue.

369
00:29:19,401 --> 00:29:26,040
She certainly isn't acting on her pregnancy or seeking marriage or an abortion or planning for a baby or anything like that.

370
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,200
It's just another thing which she sort of denies.

371
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,001
And I guess, this is a funny one.

372
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:40,601
She seems to repudiate being grown up because she comforts herself by hugging her teddy bear.

373
00:29:40,601 --> 00:29:45,000
And then I discovered looking around the room that she's not the only one.

374
00:29:45,401 --> 00:29:47,801
I know my son still has a security blanket.

375
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,320
I was just visiting him in LA.

376
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:54,441
He's 29 now, and there it was next to his pillow, just like it's always been.

377
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,960
He went off to school.

378
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:02,200
He went off to boarding school in the East at 13, just by himself, all by himself with his security blanket.

379
00:30:02,441 --> 00:30:03,921
But that's, he's special.

380
00:30:03,641 --> 00:30:09,681
But I mean, normally, I don't know how many of you still have your security blanket.

381
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:10,641
Anybody?

382
00:30:10,641 --> 00:30:11,681
Well, that's what I thought.

383
00:30:11,681 --> 00:30:19,200
The last time I taught it, half the class, the same half I think who was annoyed already, said claim they did.

384
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,601
But anyway, she doesn't seem to be very grown up.

385
00:30:21,601 --> 00:30:24,480
She has her teddy bear to hug.

386
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,001
So, what so she's, what is Patricia then?

387
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,641
Not an American, not French, not a student, not a writer, not an adult, not a woman, and so forth.

388
00:30:34,881 --> 00:30:36,081
Michelle sums it up.

389
00:30:36,081 --> 00:30:37,681
Do you remember what he calls her?

390
00:30:37,681 --> 00:30:39,760
He says you're a Martian.

391
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,960
And meaning that she's just weird.

392
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,880
And that none of that, and that he likes that about her, that she's a Martian.

393
00:30:46,881 --> 00:30:47,601
What?

394
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,600
Yeah, you look like a Martian, that's right.

395
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:53,521
Okay, is that different than being one, I guess?

396
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,401
Not much different.

397
00:30:54,401 --> 00:30:57,761
And in this context, I mean, I think, but maybe.

398
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,120
If so, I take it back.

399
00:30:59,121 --> 00:31:04,321
But she does look like a Martian, particularly in that picture of her on the escalator when she's whipped from below.

400
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:05,520
She looks very weird.

401
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,760
And at the end of the movie, she looks very weird.

402
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:12,561
But I think she's doesn't matter what he calls her.

403
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:16,320
She certainly is defined in this negative way.

404
00:31:16,321 --> 00:31:18,480
And she even wants to repudiate her name.

405
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,921
Remember, she'd rather be called Ingrid than be Patricia.

406
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:32,240
And I don't know how much you take seriously, whether the Ingrid for her and the Bogey for him is making a reference again to Casablanca.

407
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:37,121
All the movies we see finally refer to Casablanca, or is that just in my head?

408
00:31:37,121 --> 00:31:43,921
But the important thing is, she, it's interesting, when you don't want your name, that really shows you don't want your identity.

409
00:31:43,921 --> 00:31:47,441
And it fits perfectly that she doesn't want her name.

410
00:31:52,040 --> 00:32:04,441
And she, if she wants to be Ingrid, and if that's Ingrid Bergman, she certainly does devote herself to Ingrid with this kind of intensity that Michelle obviously dedicates himself to Bogie.

411
00:32:04,441 --> 00:32:07,001
And it's important to know, I didn't know that.

412
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,641
Did you know that?

413
00:32:07,641 --> 00:32:11,720
That this gesture with his lips, that's Bogie's gesture.

414
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,801
And did you know that he does that in movies?

415
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,681
I never saw that in a Bogart movie.

416
00:32:16,681 --> 00:32:17,401
What?

417
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,120
Oh, really?

418
00:32:20,441 --> 00:32:28,121
But going like this is what Michelle does when he looks at the picture, and he does it again.

419
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:31,721
Well, she does it at the end.

420
00:32:31,721 --> 00:32:32,441
Yeah.

421
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:43,321
Well, we've got to find out why she does it, but it's important that it's his gesture, which I think we're supposed to think he took from Bogart.

422
00:32:43,321 --> 00:32:49,641
But unless anybody knows more Bogart and more movies than I do, I can't claim that I've ever seen Bogart do it.

423
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:59,561
But anyway, he's got this gesture, and he has it when he's looking at the Bogart picture.

424
00:33:00,281 --> 00:33:05,801
So, more important now to the big, bigger things, she's always unhappy.

425
00:33:05,801 --> 00:33:07,720
But it's not clear why she's unhappy.

426
00:33:07,721 --> 00:33:21,561
But remember, Nietzsche goes on about why people would be unhappy if all the values in the world that they cared about once didn't work anymore, had lost their value.

427
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,600
And somehow she's got this kind of unhappiness.

428
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:30,681
She says, Quote, I don't know if I'm unhappy because I'm not free or not free because I'm unhappy.

429
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,201
That doesn't help very much.

430
00:33:32,201 --> 00:33:33,240
But here's a better one.

431
00:33:33,241 --> 00:33:35,601
She says, I'm thinking of nothing.

432
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,401
I want to think of something, but I can't.

433
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:40,400
I think that's true.

434
00:33:40,721 --> 00:33:42,480
Nothing matters to her.

435
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,921
Nothing means anything to her.

436
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:46,161
She'd like to care about something.

437
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,641
Michelle can always think of something.

438
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,480
That's his open horizon.

439
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,841
That's his creative ability.

440
00:33:53,841 --> 00:33:56,321
She doesn't have an open horizon.

441
00:33:56,321 --> 00:34:03,041
She can only complain about the meaning is missing from her life and feels sorry for herself.

442
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,560
And it scares her.

443
00:34:04,881 --> 00:34:06,560
Remember, he likes nothingness.

444
00:34:06,721 --> 00:34:08,480
He likes death.

445
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,361
She sees behind his face that there's nothing, no identity, no commitments.

446
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:16,320
She sees really that he's an active nihilist.

447
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:20,960
And for her, that's frightening.

448
00:34:21,281 --> 00:34:24,161
Nothingness and people who live in nothingness.

449
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,641
She says, on 86, you know, you said I was afraid, Michelle.

450
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,361
It's true.

451
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:31,680
I'm afraid because I want you to love me.

452
00:34:31,761 --> 00:34:32,480
Then I don't know.

453
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,160
That's going to be, that's later.

454
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,681
Let's try this.

455
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,521
Here, I'll come back to that.

456
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:43,681
She says, I've watched you for 10 minutes and seen nothing, nothing, nothing.

457
00:34:44,321 --> 00:34:50,560
And then Michelle makes the gesture, it says, with his lips and thumb, and she says, I'm sad.

458
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:53,601
I'm not sad, but I'm afraid.

459
00:34:53,921 --> 00:35:00,160
And that's part of her way of being.

460
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:00,721
Yeah.

461
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,361
Ah, you're on an important thing.

462
00:35:09,361 --> 00:35:10,960
Someone indeed.

463
00:35:12,881 --> 00:35:14,000
We're going to get to that.

464
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,921
In fact, it's the next sentence.

465
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:17,360
I congratulate you.

466
00:35:17,921 --> 00:35:20,360
It's the part about the wild palms.

467
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,840
My next sentence was: she discusses with Michelle a passage from Faulkner.

468
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,960
She asks whether one would choose grief or nothing.

469
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,200
And she chooses grief.

470
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:45,641
And you know, you remember Nietzsche saying that we've gotten so addicted to meaning that people would suffer or do anything rather than say that nothing meant anything.

471
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:56,921
And she chooses grief because she would choose grief because she doesn't like meaninglessness, can't stand meaninglessness, I take it.

472
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:59,960
And that's the view of a passive nihilist.

473
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:06,201
Nietzsche says these people would rather suffer than face meaninglessness.

474
00:36:06,201 --> 00:36:09,161
And Michelle, of course, says he would choose nothing.

475
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,921
He says grief is a compromise.

476
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:12,681
It must be all or nothing.

477
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,601
I take that to be the same thing as live dangerously just to the end.

478
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:27,801
I mean, throw yourself completely into whatever you're doing, whatever brief habit you've got, but in the end, you understand that none of it needs anything.

479
00:36:27,801 --> 00:36:29,720
And death is at the bottom of it.

480
00:36:29,721 --> 00:36:31,881
And that's our iTunes.

481
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:39,241
And he has this fantasy in which the reward is all or nothing.

482
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:42,441
The fellow steals the money, takes the girl away to Italy.

483
00:36:42,441 --> 00:36:49,720
They support themselves by stealing cars, as in the opening scene, until finally they're caught and go to prison together.

484
00:36:52,120 --> 00:37:06,480
That's part of his, I guess, view that you sort of follow through on whatever your brief habit is and your realization that it's going to finally fail, that that's all right too.

485
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,361
Something like that.

486
00:37:04,281 --> 00:37:10,080
It's funny that they finally get caught and go to prison together.

487
00:37:10,401 --> 00:37:32,801
And she has no fantasies like that guiding her life from minute to minute when he has his whole story that he's living out through the movie comes up every once in a while that he's going to go run off to Italy with her now that he's killed the policeman and can't live in France and they're going to live together and steal cars until that doesn't work anymore.

488
00:37:32,801 --> 00:37:36,401
And now comes the part I was reading by accident.

489
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:42,321
Her idea of freedom isn't freedom to invent something like he's got.

490
00:37:42,321 --> 00:37:45,121
It's this kind of negative freedom.

491
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,841
Freedom from everything.

492
00:37:47,841 --> 00:37:51,921
He says on page 86, no.

493
00:37:51,921 --> 00:37:54,000
Where was I that I just had it?

494
00:37:54,401 --> 00:37:55,841
Maybe aphorism 86.

495
00:37:55,841 --> 00:37:58,480
That's always a problem to keep them straight.

496
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,561
And if that's not it, I'll find it by going back to where I was.

497
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,840
Well, that's not it either.

498
00:38:03,841 --> 00:38:11,201
Let's go back to what was I reading when I stumble onto this 86.

499
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,040
I must be losing my brain.

500
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,960
Am I in the right book, yeah?

501
00:38:16,241 --> 00:38:19,201
There's nothing on 86, and I was just reading it.

502
00:38:19,201 --> 00:38:20,881
What was I reading?

503
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,561
Hmm?

504
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,960
What was I reading when I read the wrong thing?

505
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,000
And then.

506
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:30,080
What page?

507
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,921
That's the problem.

508
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,000
Yeah, but where was that?

509
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,960
But I haven't got anything on 86.

510
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,881
What is going on with me?

511
00:38:43,201 --> 00:38:44,640
And I just read it.

512
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,281
It's clearly, oh, I have got the wrong book.

513
00:38:50,921 --> 00:38:52,600
Ah, well, that explains a lot.

514
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,361
Somebody was trying to tell me this.

515
00:38:49,281 --> 00:38:56,280
Okay, so here we are.

516
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,881
She doesn't like risk and responsibility.

517
00:38:59,881 --> 00:39:02,441
Her idea of freedom is negative freedom.

518
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:09,881
She says somewhere on 86, according to this, I want people to leave me alone.

519
00:39:10,201 --> 00:39:11,721
Where is it?

520
00:39:13,321 --> 00:39:14,281
Now I got the page.

521
00:39:14,281 --> 00:39:15,321
I still don't find the quote.

522
00:39:15,321 --> 00:39:17,320
There's a very hard-to-find quote.

523
00:39:17,401 --> 00:39:19,400
I don't know where it's, but she does say that.

524
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:20,840
I want people to leave me alone.

525
00:39:20,841 --> 00:39:24,920
I don't know why I don't see it.

526
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,320
Well, you'll see it if you look for it.

527
00:39:31,321 --> 00:39:32,120
Take my word for it.

528
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,641
She certainly says that.

529
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:48,521
And she says, And her freedom is a kind of negative freedom.

530
00:39:49,801 --> 00:39:56,521
She says on the 86th, the one I read, I want you to love me, and then I don't want you to love me.

531
00:39:57,401 --> 00:40:01,161
I don't know, I want you not to love me anymore.

532
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,241
I'm very independent, you know.

533
00:40:03,241 --> 00:40:09,641
She doesn't want ever to get even temporarily involved, even in a brief habit.

534
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:15,720
She wants to be totally free, in the sense of negatively free.

535
00:40:15,721 --> 00:40:20,681
It's not free to invent anything or try out anything.

536
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,561
It's just people leaving her alone.

537
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,640
It's funny, I'm going to look up that page.

538
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,841
I don't know why I don't.

539
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,000
140.

540
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,880
Hooray.

541
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,121
What makes you think so?

542
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:33,921
You got it.

543
00:40:33,801 --> 00:40:34,560
You're right.

544
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,361
You're right.

545
00:40:35,361 --> 00:40:36,320
What a brilliant thing.

546
00:40:36,321 --> 00:40:37,921
How did you just do that?

547
00:40:34,281 --> 00:40:40,160
Okay, 140, she says.

548
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,801
I wish people would just leave me alone.

549
00:40:42,801 --> 00:40:44,401
I don't believe in independence.

550
00:40:44,401 --> 00:40:45,281
No, Michelle's.

551
00:40:45,361 --> 00:40:57,121
Well, this is near the end where they're having this amazing conversation, walking around in the room with the clarinet, quintet, music in the background, and they're each talking and they're not really paying much to each other.

552
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,641
And it's kind of beautiful.

553
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,280
She says, I wish people would leave me alone.

554
00:41:01,281 --> 00:41:04,401
And he, I don't believe in independence, but I am independent.

555
00:41:04,401 --> 00:41:06,401
Patricia, maybe you love me.

556
00:41:06,801 --> 00:41:08,801
You believe it, and you aren't.

557
00:41:08,801 --> 00:41:10,480
I don't know what that means exactly.

558
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,721
That's why I turned you in.

559
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:15,761
She says, I'm superior to you, he says.

560
00:41:15,761 --> 00:41:18,560
And then the crucial thing, why did she turn him in?

561
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,281
She says, now you're forced to leave.

562
00:41:21,281 --> 00:41:24,240
And that's, I mean, that's what she wants.

563
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,721
She wants her independence, and that requires getting rid of him.

564
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,881
Because he's hanging around with this idea that they're like Romeo and Juliet.

565
00:41:32,881 --> 00:41:47,281
And she has this sort of nostalgia for meaning, like Romeo and Juliet, but she doesn't, she's not, but she doesn't really want any commitments or any involvement or any responsibility.

566
00:41:47,281 --> 00:41:51,921
And that's because, Michelle sums it up, she's a coward.

567
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,120
The new version, I think, says she's a chicken.

568
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,401
I don't like that.

569
00:41:56,721 --> 00:41:58,960
She's lot in French.

570
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,960
That's just plain cowardly.

571
00:42:01,841 --> 00:42:09,041
And she can't stand the idea that she would lose this negative freedom.

572
00:42:09,361 --> 00:42:11,120
She won't take any risks.

573
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,801
And having meaning requires taking risks.

574
00:42:15,921 --> 00:42:19,441
Or you can just live in a wonder world like a free spirit.

575
00:42:20,281 --> 00:42:22,441
And then you have to live dangerously.

576
00:42:22,441 --> 00:42:23,800
That's a different kind of risk.

577
00:42:23,801 --> 00:42:30,601
Instead of risking grief, you risk whatever happens when you steal cars and shoot policemen.

578
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,841
And she's too weak to live dangerously.

579
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:35,081
That's what it is to be a coward.

580
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:42,360
And now she does at a certain point admit she's really in love with him.

581
00:42:42,361 --> 00:42:43,721
That's interesting.

582
00:42:43,721 --> 00:42:48,681
I mean, there is one real kiss in the movie, remember?

583
00:42:50,281 --> 00:42:59,800
Well, certainly not in the not, certainly in the hotel room scene where they go to bed together finally, you know, the series of all kinds of weird jokes.

584
00:42:59,801 --> 00:43:04,761
When they do sort of kiss each other, they're just rubbing noses and they're not kissing each other.

585
00:43:04,761 --> 00:43:08,600
And then she finds out that he killed a policeman.

586
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:13,080
She sees it on the news thing.

587
00:43:13,401 --> 00:43:18,921
And he, and then they run and hide in a movie.

588
00:43:18,921 --> 00:43:23,800
And then she says, I think I must have written it here where it is.

589
00:43:24,841 --> 00:43:26,441
Well, I jumped ahead.

590
00:43:26,761 --> 00:43:32,841
But I'll tell you, she says, I love you tremendously, Michelle, or something like that.

591
00:43:32,841 --> 00:43:35,241
And they really kiss each other.

592
00:43:35,241 --> 00:43:41,401
And she can do that because now that he's killed the policeman, she knows he has to leave.

593
00:43:41,721 --> 00:43:47,561
And it's like Yvonne saying you shouldn't get intimate with anybody except when they're just about to leave.

594
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,960
And it's a way of protecting yourself.

595
00:43:50,441 --> 00:43:51,881
And she's got that.

596
00:43:51,881 --> 00:43:53,401
But I jumped ahead.

597
00:43:53,721 --> 00:43:56,841
Let's see if I can catch up with myself.

598
00:44:00,441 --> 00:44:01,720
I just say I summed her up.

599
00:44:01,721 --> 00:44:04,480
She's cowardly, disgruntled, and apathetic.

600
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,960
She is a passive nihilist.

601
00:44:07,361 --> 00:44:12,801
She understands that nothing means anything, and she doesn't like that a bit.

602
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,640
Now, so now we can go.

603
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:20,160
Well, no, let's say what anybody wants to say about Patricia, because the next subject is how they're related to each other.

604
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,520
That's what I jumped ahead to by accident just now.

605
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,760
But are you happy with this reading of Patricia?

606
00:44:25,761 --> 00:44:27,920
Does anybody think I did something wrong to her?

607
00:44:27,921 --> 00:44:28,960
Yeah.

608
00:44:33,761 --> 00:44:35,201
Why did she what?

609
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,721
Well, you're getting ahead of the story.

610
00:44:38,721 --> 00:44:46,881
Although, there are enough pieces around now that if you really think about it, you could figure out why she has to turn him in.

611
00:44:47,201 --> 00:44:53,600
But you, yeah, it's perfectly clear, but probably not the first time through the movie.

612
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,120
And don't try to don't tell me.

613
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,401
I don't want to know yet.

614
00:44:56,401 --> 00:44:58,960
Are you going to tell me the answer why she has to turn him in?

615
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,361
Good.

616
00:44:59,361 --> 00:45:00,400
Tell me something else.

617
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:11,040
Who thinks?

618
00:45:11,361 --> 00:45:13,040
You're making me go ahead of the story.

619
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:24,480
But it's clear that she thinks that if she turns him in and tells him that she's turned him in, he has to run away and flee and hide and go to Italy and so forth.

620
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:30,561
She doesn't want him to go to prison, which would be for life for pilling a policeman.

621
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,641
There is no death penalty in France.

622
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:37,680
And she doesn't want him to die, is what happens when he doesn't get shot by the policeman.

623
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,281
She wants him to leave.

624
00:45:39,281 --> 00:45:44,720
She wants him to leave because she wants her independence, as she puts it.

625
00:45:44,721 --> 00:45:49,881
She doesn't want to take the risk of grief and involvement, and she's getting really involved with him.

626
00:45:49,881 --> 00:45:53,641
But you guys jump me ahead of the story, so let me go there.

627
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:58,121
So, why is it click for Michelle with Patricia?

628
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,841
You might think that he would hate her.

629
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:06,841
After all, he says, if you don't like France, the sea, the mountains, the big city, go fuck yourself.

630
00:46:06,841 --> 00:46:09,000
Getting translated, stuck it, I think.

631
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,880
And that's weird.

632
00:46:09,881 --> 00:46:10,441
I don't know what.

633
00:46:10,441 --> 00:46:11,320
Is it British?

634
00:46:11,321 --> 00:46:16,760
I don't know what the strange translations are at the bottom of the movie.

635
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:26,681
But anyway, it looks like he just thinks that she would be just the kind of person he couldn't stand.

636
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,361
She doesn't seem to like anything.

637
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:41,320
And she doesn't seem nearly as attractive as the sincere, good-looking, hard-working, trusting, loving girl with a job and moral principles.

638
00:46:41,321 --> 00:46:45,720
Remember, she says she stopped getting in the movie business because she had to sleep with too many people.

639
00:46:46,441 --> 00:46:54,121
And the one, that girl, very important, just though you see her briefly, she is the opposite to Patricia.

640
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,801
But Michelle doesn't find her interesting.

641
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,601
Yet she's the only decent moral person in the movie.

642
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:14,441
But there's something really funny about her that makes her funny in the sense special about her that makes her uninteresting to Michelle in a way that Patricia is interesting, Michelle.

643
00:47:14,441 --> 00:47:15,321
It's very subtle.

644
00:47:15,321 --> 00:47:17,161
It took me years to see it.

645
00:47:17,721 --> 00:47:23,080
That is, she has, when he's in her room, he sees this thing on her wall.

646
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,441
Did anybody notice this?

647
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:25,560
I mean, I certainly did.

648
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,041
I mean, if you did, it would be amazing.

649
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,640
Know that she's got something praised on her.

650
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,561
Well, what did it say?

651
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:38,561
I see, well, pour qui, which means why.

652
00:47:34,201 --> 00:47:40,880
But is it all there?

653
00:47:34,281 --> 00:47:41,761
Not quite.

654
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,400
It says, he says, what's written there?

655
00:47:44,401 --> 00:47:47,841
And she says, pour qua, but I never finished it.

656
00:47:48,721 --> 00:47:49,921
I ran out of lucky's.

657
00:47:49,921 --> 00:47:51,120
She's making it out of lucky.

658
00:47:51,361 --> 00:48:02,561
So she's started to ask the question of why, do anything, or you know, the question why finds no answer, he says in the will to power.

659
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:06,000
And that's when the bottom falls out of everything.

660
00:48:06,881 --> 00:48:10,160
Back to why informers inform and so forth, that has no answer.

661
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,520
Why lovers do what they do?

662
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,761
Why anybody does what anybody does?

663
00:48:13,761 --> 00:48:14,960
It has no answer.

664
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,601
There is just no good reason for doing anything.

665
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,401
Now, has she discovered that?

666
00:48:20,721 --> 00:48:22,081
Not quite.

667
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:27,041
She has started to write Pourqui, the why on the wall, but she never finished it.

668
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:32,081
She hasn't sort of thought it through to actual nihilism.

669
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,600
She thinks there are answers.

670
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:38,880
She's got her job, she's got her morality, she's got so forth.

671
00:48:38,881 --> 00:48:45,201
She's still got a life in which things mean things, and she won't push the why all the way.

672
00:48:45,201 --> 00:48:47,200
That's an amazing little tale.

673
00:48:47,201 --> 00:48:50,881
I think just incredible that Godart would put such a funny thing in there.

674
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,881
Let me repeat it.

675
00:48:52,881 --> 00:49:01,601
She's asking the question, which, if she really asked the whole question why, she would discover that the why has no answer, and she'd be in nihilism.

676
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,200
But she hasn't asked the question.

677
00:49:03,201 --> 00:49:06,960
She stopped before she thought the question through.

678
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:13,681
And now you can see, and that's why Michelle doesn't find her interesting.

679
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,681
The thing about Patricia is how she got there, I don't know.

680
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,280
Before Patricia, the why has no answer.

681
00:49:19,361 --> 00:49:21,960
She's in nihilism.

682
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,720
So, and then that's where's my where's the will to power quotes?

683
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:29,000
Oh, here they are.

684
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,121
Okay, I think I can find it in a hurry, even though it was marked on mine.

685
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:45,161
If anybody has the will to power quotes and sees that quote, here it is.

686
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,520
What does nihilism mean?

687
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:52,521
That the highest values evaluate themselves, the aim is lacking, why finds no answer.

688
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:55,960
That, I think, is what's being planted there.

689
00:49:57,241 --> 00:50:11,401
And so, Michelle and Patricia are both not in her world where there's still reasons for doing things, and they are in the same world, the world where why has no answer.

690
00:50:11,401 --> 00:50:14,521
They are in the after God is dead world.

691
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:32,761
And what makes them so attractive to each other is that they are both in the nihilism dimension, and that makes them different from all the people who really don't understand, the people in the marketplace who don't really understand yet that God is dead.

692
00:50:32,761 --> 00:50:42,041
And it makes them so one of these rare, it makes him a free spirit, it makes her a passive nihilist.

693
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:52,361
So, on the one hand, you have courage, cheerfulness, energy, and so forth.

694
00:50:52,361 --> 00:50:53,240
That's him.

695
00:50:53,241 --> 00:50:57,801
On the other hand, you have cowardice, disgruntled, and apathy.

696
00:50:57,801 --> 00:50:59,321
That's her.

697
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:08,400
So, even joyless and lost as she is, she has more in common with Michelle than the girl still living by the old values.

698
00:51:08,721 --> 00:51:13,600
What he likes about Patricia is that she shares his nihilism.

699
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:26,000
Even though she's the opposite reaction to it, she's more like him than anybody else in the movie because they're all still, they haven't really gone all the way with the why question.

700
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:37,361
So she sees, as he sees, that all seriousness doesn't make any sense anymore.

701
00:51:37,361 --> 00:51:44,401
That they're living in a world after the values have all been devaluated, as Nietzsche says.

702
00:51:44,721 --> 00:51:51,441
These other people still have jobs and marriages and families and think they're important.

703
00:51:52,241 --> 00:51:57,361
But for Michelle and Patricia, all meaningful distinctions are leveled.

704
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,161
So you get all these funny leveling things.

705
00:52:00,401 --> 00:52:03,520
My favorite, but you have to know French to really appreciate it.

706
00:52:03,841 --> 00:52:10,080
But whatever language you know, if it has a distinction between the intimate and the formal, in French it's tu et vous.

707
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,400
In German it's du et vie.

708
00:52:12,401 --> 00:52:22,401
But in any case, it's very important whether you're saying to somebody tu, which you say to your children and the person your lover, or whether you're saying the polite form.

709
00:52:22,401 --> 00:52:28,721
But Michelle and Patricia say tou and vous are equal, they say at one point.

710
00:52:28,721 --> 00:52:32,801
Or another one, physical attraction is equal.

711
00:52:33,201 --> 00:52:37,041
In the hotel room, he says, I want to make love to you because you're beautiful.

712
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,720
And then she says, no, I'm not beautiful.

713
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:41,121
And he says, okay, then, because you're ugly.

714
00:52:43,441 --> 00:52:44,560
It's all indifferent.

715
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,520
It's all leveled.

716
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,081
I mean, the distinctions don't count anymore.

717
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,761
And now comes the poetry one, finally.

718
00:52:51,241 --> 00:52:55,241
And there are no explanations because there's no answer to the why question.

719
00:52:55,241 --> 00:52:57,480
So, why are you sad?

720
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,801
He says, because I'm sad.

721
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:02,201
She says, why do you look at me?

722
00:53:02,201 --> 00:53:05,401
She says, because I look at you, he says.

723
00:53:05,401 --> 00:53:08,600
All events turn out to be these kind of tautologies.

724
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:17,080
People's actions aren't caused by their complexes, anxieties, desires, commitments, values, religion.

725
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,480
There's nothing behind what people do.

726
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,241
Only people don't know it.

727
00:53:21,241 --> 00:53:22,520
They think their reasons.

728
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:33,000
If you ask them why they did what they did, they'll tell you why, because it's the moral thing to do, the right thing to do, the thing that everybody in their family does, whatever.

729
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,721
But there's really nothing to say about them.

730
00:53:35,721 --> 00:53:39,401
It's all a kind of nihilistic poetry.

731
00:53:39,401 --> 00:53:42,921
And so I was going to read you a piece of it on 124.

732
00:53:42,921 --> 00:53:45,480
They go into it every once in a while.

733
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:52,441
He says, informing, I think, is really bad.

734
00:53:52,441 --> 00:53:58,281
But that she hasn't really seen her, even she hasn't put her nihilism all the way.

735
00:53:58,281 --> 00:54:03,800
And he says, as if reciting a poem on 124 top, no, it's normal.

736
00:54:03,801 --> 00:54:05,080
Informers inform.

737
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,361
Burglars burgle.

738
00:54:06,361 --> 00:54:07,641
Lovers love.

739
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,560
Look at the Place La Concorde.

740
00:54:09,801 --> 00:54:11,320
It's so beautiful.

741
00:54:11,721 --> 00:54:17,960
And so that's part of that same picture.

742
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:23,321
No moral guidelines, no goals, no explanations.

743
00:54:23,321 --> 00:54:24,760
She sees that.

744
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:29,561
What he dislikes about her is she doesn't enjoy it.

745
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:33,480
And of course, that's the difference between the positive and negative nihilists.

746
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:40,081
He enjoys the fact that nothing has any reasons and that there's no why and you can just do anything you please.

747
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:44,881
But she sits and is disgruntled about it.

748
00:54:45,841 --> 00:54:47,920
He turns it into this kind of poetry.

749
00:54:47,921 --> 00:54:52,081
She just sulks and wishes she could think something positive.

750
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:56,560
And finally, he says to her, I don't know where it is, you do things by half measures.

751
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,561
It destroys my morale.

752
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:03,680
If anybody comes across that quote, tell me and I'll put it in my thing here.

753
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:15,841
But that's the difference between, you know, living courageously, just go boo, just till the end, all the way, going, and he wants to plunge into everything, do it all the way.

754
00:55:15,841 --> 00:55:20,640
He wants to plunge into his relation to her until it becomes boring if it does.

755
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,120
And right now, he doesn't think it could ever become boring.

756
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:30,240
But the main thing is that he wants to explore it, throw himself into it.

757
00:55:30,241 --> 00:55:33,361
That's his way of doing whatever he does.

758
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,321
Now, there's this funny connection.

759
00:55:36,321 --> 00:55:37,680
Oh, anybody want to say anything about that?

760
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,320
That's what I have to say about their relationship right now.

761
00:55:40,321 --> 00:55:42,561
It'll come back, their relationship.

762
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:45,921
But the basic thing is to see, it's like those positive and negatives.

763
00:55:45,921 --> 00:55:49,521
I just realized in electricity or in magnets attracting each other.

764
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,160
They are the positive and negative of nihilism.

765
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,520
They attract each other.

766
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,161
Yeah.

767
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,801
Often when meetings, like what they weren't softening what?

768
00:56:00,801 --> 00:56:01,441
Yeah.

769
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,160
No, that's really just playing around with the French business.

770
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,080
She doesn't really, she doesn't know French very well.

771
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:13,841
She has a yeah.

772
00:56:13,841 --> 00:56:18,320
You know, I don't think that's deep in the end because I don't think she's trying to find meaning in him.

773
00:56:18,321 --> 00:56:20,760
I think she's given up trying to find meaning in him.

774
00:56:19,281 --> 00:56:24,121
That's what's the scariness that when she looks at him, she sees nothing.

775
00:56:24,441 --> 00:56:27,161
I think she knows that.

776
00:56:27,721 --> 00:56:31,161
And that's what makes him so attractive to her, presumably.

777
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:41,161
Even though she's afraid of this nothing, at least it's though they understand that they live in the same world, a world in which nothing means anything.

778
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,720
And she isn't even trying to make anything mean anything.

779
00:56:43,721 --> 00:56:50,441
She's just sulking and complaining that she can't think anything, she can't keep any job, she can't have any identity.

780
00:56:51,401 --> 00:57:00,920
She's further along in nihilism than the people who are still, to put it in a funny Nietzsche way, who are still in the shadows of God.

781
00:57:00,921 --> 00:57:11,800
There's this place where he says, I don't think I told you to read it yet, that after God is dead, that people still believe in his shadow, which they see in caves.

782
00:57:11,801 --> 00:57:16,361
It occurs to me just to say it right now, what would be shadows of God?

783
00:57:16,361 --> 00:57:21,240
Well, Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky are shadows of God from Nietzsche's point of view.

784
00:57:21,241 --> 00:57:37,000
They're people who still think that though Big Deal, the Supreme Being, is gone out of their picture, there's still something left that is sacred, something which is the ultimate meaning of life.

785
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,960
So they're still in the shadows of God.

786
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,721
But these two people aren't.

787
00:57:41,721 --> 00:57:43,880
And that's what they find attractive.

788
00:57:43,881 --> 00:57:50,041
They have no version of how to get, how to have a meaningful life.

789
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:53,561
There just isn't any answer to the why anymore.

790
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,321
And they know it.

791
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,160
Now, one more contrast.

792
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,600
Anybody find this quote?

793
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,720
No, that's all right.

794
00:57:59,721 --> 00:58:01,561
I'll find it eventually.

795
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:11,361
So, what I thought of was an interesting contrast was he's got this egoism, which is not, which is totally unreflective.

796
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,321
He's not sort of hung up on himself.

797
00:58:14,321 --> 00:58:16,080
He doesn't even think about himself.

798
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:23,840
His egoism is simply to freely do and take and demand and desire whatever he does.

799
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:29,520
But she's got something that different kind of egoism, which let's not call it egoism.

800
00:58:29,761 --> 00:58:37,361
When he's looking at Bogart, we see a place where she looks at something with the same wrapped attention as he looks at Bogart.

801
00:58:37,441 --> 00:58:38,801
Do you remember that?

802
00:58:38,801 --> 00:58:41,121
In that window of his store?

803
00:58:41,761 --> 00:58:43,761
She's looking at herself.

804
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:54,720
And it's not clear whether she's looking at her face, because I think she is at first, but then she's looking at her figure, and maybe she's thinking about whether she's pregnant or not.

805
00:58:54,721 --> 00:58:55,281
I don't know.

806
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:59,841
But mainly, she's just, she's completely narcissistic.

807
00:58:59,841 --> 00:59:02,161
All she sees is herself.

808
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:09,680
Remember with the Renoir painting in the Renoir picture of a woman that is hanging in her bedroom in the hotel room?

809
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,441
What does she say about that?

810
00:59:12,721 --> 00:59:13,601
Hmm?

811
00:59:13,921 --> 00:59:16,561
Yeah, doesn't she look like me?

812
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:24,480
She bought this Renoir not because she thinks this is an interesting painting or she collects post-impressionist art or whatever that is.

813
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,560
She collects it because it looks like her.

814
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:33,521
So she is really wrapped up in herself, but it's a kind of empty self, so she doesn't get anything out of it.

815
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,361
Let's see.

816
00:59:35,361 --> 00:59:44,321
So the only pictures in her room, I say, other than the posters, are of herself, and she thinks of Renoir's picture as one of herself.

817
00:59:44,321 --> 00:59:47,361
It's a kind of empty narcissism.

818
00:59:47,680 --> 01:00:00,281
And in the hotel room, in the love scene, if you can call it that, the whatever it's seen in the hotel room, she says that when they look into each other's eyes, they don't really see each other.

819
01:00:00,281 --> 01:00:03,880
And later she says she sees herself in his eyes.

820
01:00:03,881 --> 01:00:10,040
It's again, I mean, this mirror thing that she doesn't see, of course, there's not much to see in him, but nothing.

821
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:13,161
But she should be happy to see the nothing in him.

822
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:25,721
Now, another place where she gets this expression, besides when she's looking at herself, and it turns out to be important, I think, is when the author says that something that strikes her.

823
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:29,401
She says something to him like, what do you want in your life?

824
01:00:29,401 --> 01:00:30,680
What's valuable?

825
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,281
What's meaningful to you?

826
01:00:32,281 --> 01:00:33,880
I forget what her phrase is.

827
01:00:33,881 --> 01:00:36,041
And do you remember what he tells her?

828
01:00:36,361 --> 01:00:40,041
He says, I want to become immortal and then die.

829
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:47,241
And then the music reaches a kind of climax, and she stares into the camera in a completely stunned way.

830
01:00:47,241 --> 01:00:54,680
You can't tell whether she understood it or didn't understand it or found it was profound or thought it was surprising, whatever.

831
01:00:55,881 --> 01:01:00,841
This thing really strikes her that you could become immortal and then die.

832
01:01:00,841 --> 01:01:03,401
And it may turn out to be important later.

833
01:01:03,401 --> 01:01:04,600
I claim it is.

834
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,641
Now let's see.

835
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:14,521
I call out a look of total incomprehension or maybe a new idea that never struck her.

836
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:21,241
But anyway, okay, so now we jump to where you all made me jump earlier.

837
01:01:21,241 --> 01:01:25,801
Why does Patricia finally really love Michelle?

838
01:01:25,801 --> 01:01:34,200
She only starts to love him when she sees he killed a cop, and then she says on 123, I love you enormously, Michelle.

839
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:42,561
And that's because she's safe, her independence is safe, she knows she's got to leave.

840
01:01:45,361 --> 01:01:47,441
And that's okay.

841
01:01:47,761 --> 01:01:51,521
And then they kiss passionately in the movie.

842
01:01:52,321 --> 01:01:57,600
And is it just that, you know, she thinks, wow, isn't that heroic?

843
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:58,801
He killed a cop.

844
01:01:58,801 --> 01:02:04,800
Think of how risky, how exciting, what a life to be running around with a cop pillar.

845
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:15,441
That's sort of like what happens in the movie Badlands, where she's so interested that the guy she's running around with kills somebody every day.

846
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,241
But that's not what's exciting to her.

847
01:02:18,241 --> 01:02:38,240
What's exciting to her is that he's going to leave, that he's doomed, that he won't hamper her negative freedom and demand commitment from her and risk and demand that she live just go disco boo, but live all the way, the way he is demanding of her.

848
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:45,680
Remember, she said earlier, and I read it by mistake, I want you to love me and I don't want you to love me.

849
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,121
I want my freedom.

850
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:50,960
And now freedom is this negative kind of freedom.

851
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,441
And now it looks like she's about to get the negative kind of freedom.

852
01:02:55,441 --> 01:02:59,041
And then she panics because he doesn't want to leave.

853
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:03,041
And it looks like he's setting it up for this trip to Italy with her.

854
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,200
And he actually is going to get the money.

855
01:03:05,201 --> 01:03:07,120
And he's going to get a car.

856
01:03:07,441 --> 01:03:12,880
And then there, and so that's when you get to page 140.

857
01:03:12,881 --> 01:03:18,761
And she says, I'm independent, and that's why I turned you in.

858
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:22,681
And she says, The crucial line, now you're forced to leave.

859
01:03:18,401 --> 01:03:23,880
And he doesn't leave.

860
01:03:18,881 --> 01:03:27,480
And she says, Why don't you leave, Michelle?

861
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:28,921
I slept with many men.

862
01:03:28,921 --> 01:03:30,120
You can't count on me.

863
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,000
Leave, Michelle.

864
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,281
What are you waiting for?

865
01:03:32,281 --> 01:03:33,960
So it's clear now.

866
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:37,960
We know why she informed on him, because there are several of you asked.

867
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:40,521
It's the only way to get rid of him.

868
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:45,080
And she has to get rid of him the way she gets rid of everything, because she's totally negative.

869
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:49,000
And she isn't going to let herself find any meaning in that relationship.

870
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:56,441
She's just a coward about getting involved, taking risks, living dangerously, and so forth.

871
01:03:56,441 --> 01:03:59,000
She just wants people to leave her alone.

872
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,720
And she doesn't expect that he'll be killed.

873
01:04:01,721 --> 01:04:03,721
She doesn't expect that he'll be captured.

874
01:04:03,721 --> 01:04:05,480
She expects he'll leave.

875
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,921
And he doesn't.

876
01:04:07,241 --> 01:04:08,200
So much for that.

877
01:04:08,201 --> 01:04:09,880
Any comments about that?

878
01:04:10,201 --> 01:04:13,160
Because now we're getting ready to understand the end.

879
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:13,801
Yeah.

880
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:22,361
Oh, yeah.

881
01:04:22,761 --> 01:04:24,281
We randomly find out that he's married.

882
01:04:24,281 --> 01:04:26,041
That's why she's reading the paper.

883
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,281
And he says, note the leveling.

884
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:29,881
Remember what he says?

885
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:31,161
Yeah.

886
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:32,280
Yes.

887
01:04:32,281 --> 01:04:33,000
So we broke.

888
01:04:33,721 --> 01:04:35,321
Yeah, I was married once.

889
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:36,680
We broke it off.

890
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:38,760
She dunked me, or I dunked her.

891
01:04:38,761 --> 01:04:42,761
I mean, that's totally leveled the whole thing.

892
01:04:43,241 --> 01:04:57,720
And it is sort of shocking, but it's totally in keeping with his way of, well, with the kind of none of the old distinctions make any difference anymore.

893
01:04:57,721 --> 01:05:04,441
That doesn't mean that at any given moment he's not throwing himself into something, but he certainly isn't going to try to decide whose fault it was.

894
01:05:04,881 --> 01:05:10,480
Notice guilt and fault and all that kind of way of thinking just doesn't enter his mind.

895
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,480
And I think that's true of the free spirit.

896
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:20,480
Guilt and who Paul it is is a Judeo-Christian legacy, which Nietzsche thinks you should get over it.

897
01:05:20,801 --> 01:05:23,840
Your cheerfulness shouldn't need it.

898
01:05:23,841 --> 01:05:26,960
And Nietzsche talks a lot about how being able to forget.

899
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:33,761
Instead of forgiving, I never thought of it before, it's forgetting, which he proposes as a good way to live.

900
01:05:34,241 --> 01:05:50,641
Okay, so now we're going to do what happens at his death, the final theme, and why we now know why she turned him in, but we don't know why he said, and I'm going to assume that it's her, that what she did was disgusting.

901
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:57,441
So you can say it's disgusting as long as you're clear what it is, namely what she did, or you can say she's disgusting.

902
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:00,000
Comes to the same thing that way.

903
01:06:00,321 --> 01:06:16,960
Okay, from the moment Michelle hears that Patricia is informed on him until his last gasp, well, the real title of Breathless Obud Souffla is the last gasp, at one's last, well, how is it?

904
01:06:17,281 --> 01:06:20,801
The Obudasuf.

905
01:06:20,801 --> 01:06:25,680
Out of breath, or one's last Obud Soufflu seems your last breath.

906
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:29,040
Not necessarily you're dying, but you're out of breath, right?

907
01:06:29,361 --> 01:06:40,000
And so until his last breath, he's now going to play out a heroic role.

908
01:06:40,001 --> 01:06:42,720
He becomes bogey, I think.

909
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:47,441
And that is, how does it look after he gets shot?

910
01:06:47,441 --> 01:06:51,560
Well, he's completely in control of the situation.

911
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:53,161
He's not panicking.

912
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,640
He doesn't lose his cool.

913
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:58,680
He chooses to stay with Patricia.

914
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:01,000
He chooses to pick up the gun.

915
01:07:01,001 --> 01:07:08,441
And that means he chooses to be shot because as soon as he does that, the police can shoot him in self-defense.

916
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:10,281
And he knows that.

917
01:07:10,281 --> 01:07:15,401
He looks at the gun and he hesitates and he decides to pick it up.

918
01:07:15,401 --> 01:07:20,120
And as soon as he does, the cop kills him, shoots him.

919
01:07:20,121 --> 01:07:21,321
Now, what happens then?

920
01:07:21,321 --> 01:07:24,760
Well, it's just, from then on, it's one of the most amazing scenes in the movie.

921
01:07:25,321 --> 01:07:27,560
I just practically cry every time I see it.

922
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,960
He runs along the crosswalk.

923
01:07:30,201 --> 01:07:34,920
He runs along the street and bouncing off the cars.

924
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:39,800
And the people come out and sort of stare at him with kind of indifference as he goes by.

925
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:45,800
And then when he gets to the crosswalk, he doesn't run out into the street where he might get run over.

926
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:54,120
He falls with a kind of dramatic fall with his feet up in the air and in the crosswalk where it's safe and he won't get hit by a car.

927
01:07:54,121 --> 01:07:56,760
And he takes a last puff on his cigarette.

928
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:01,401
He throws it away, giving up smoking, presumably, forever.

929
01:08:02,041 --> 01:08:11,000
And then who's coming along behind him and looking completely blank but Patricia?

930
01:08:11,001 --> 01:08:15,800
And now, what does he do?

931
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:19,080
Well, he could be angry at her for turning him in.

932
01:08:19,401 --> 01:08:32,361
But since he's been looking forward to death all his life, even practicing for it, and thinks about it continually, he's not going to be annoyed at her that she's given him this nice death.

933
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:36,960
He's enjoying his dramatic bogey death.

934
01:08:36,961 --> 01:08:43,040
And the proof that he's not annoyed at her at all is that he gives her the three grimaces at that point.

935
01:08:43,041 --> 01:08:44,241
That's very important.

936
01:08:44,241 --> 01:08:50,160
He wouldn't give her this sort of intimate signal that he's taught her if he were annoyed at her.

937
01:08:50,161 --> 01:08:51,840
It's their secret sign.

938
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:55,760
It's their sign, I think, that they're both outside of normal seriousness.

939
01:08:56,480 --> 01:09:03,361
That I think it's a sign when you make faces, I think it's got to do with you don't keep a straight face.

940
01:09:03,361 --> 01:09:07,361
Even in the face of death, you don't keep a straight face.

941
01:09:07,361 --> 01:09:09,281
You don't take it seriously.

942
01:09:10,081 --> 01:09:11,121
You enjoy it.

943
01:09:11,121 --> 01:09:14,640
You take it seriously as a great moment for a performance.

944
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,560
And that's what he does.

945
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:28,880
And the free spirit I wrote here doesn't, there's nothing at which he cannot laugh.

946
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:32,241
And I wrote here, not even death, but I don't remember Richard saying that.

947
01:09:32,241 --> 01:09:33,840
It looks like me saying that.

948
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:34,960
Let's find out.

949
01:09:34,961 --> 01:09:37,200
347.

950
01:09:40,081 --> 01:09:47,441
No, that's the one where he confronts all earthly seriousness, all solemnity, as if it were its parody.

951
01:09:47,441 --> 01:09:48,880
That's true.

952
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:57,281
And it is true that even death in its seriousness is now being turned into a sort of sort of a joke, sort of a performance.

953
01:09:57,281 --> 01:09:59,840
And so he makes the faces.

954
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,840
And then what happens?

955
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,520
What does she do?

956
01:10:04,161 --> 01:10:06,080
Well, she just looks at him.

957
01:10:06,081 --> 01:10:08,800
Well, the question is, what does he expect her to do?

958
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:17,120
I mean, what won't she do at this point if she loves him and really understands him?

959
01:10:17,441 --> 01:10:23,800
Well, the one thing she can do is, in effect, applaud and appreciate his last great performance.

960
01:10:24,121 --> 01:10:30,840
He's dying with style, and he's sort of orchestrating and enjoying every minute of it.

961
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:37,640
She should, if not applaud, at least smile and nod and give him some recognition and some encouragement.

962
01:10:38,281 --> 01:10:44,441
But that's, and that would be, I mean, she should be applauding his last act of positive nihilism.

963
01:10:44,441 --> 01:10:52,520
But of course, she can't do that because she doesn't understand it, so she doesn't know what to make of it that he's dying and making these faces at her.

964
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:56,520
She just stares at him, looks completely blank.

965
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:06,600
And the fascinating thing is, at that point, passive and active nihilism see each other as the opposite ends of the spectrum of nihilism.

966
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:14,441
And while they were together, they appreciated the fact that they shared the fact that the why finds no answer.

967
01:11:14,441 --> 01:11:19,480
Now, within this nihilism, they are totally opposed.

968
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:30,121
I mean, he's doing his active nihilism thing, and she at the opposite end they have, I have this great phrase, they have nothing in common with a Catholic.

969
01:11:30,121 --> 01:11:37,000
I mean, the one thing that they have is the nothingness in common, but then within the nothingness, they have nothing in common.

970
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:38,600
That's the problem.

971
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:48,361
And for that reason, not because he's been killed, he says that she is revolting or the situation is revolting.

972
01:11:48,361 --> 01:11:51,401
And he then finally closes his own eyes.

973
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,880
Again, he's in complete control.

974
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:58,120
He's performed the whole thing just as he wanted it to be performed.

975
01:11:59,001 --> 01:12:03,401
And then she looks at him.

976
01:12:03,401 --> 01:12:13,760
Well, then she turns to the police and says that he means she's revolting for turning him in, but the police don't understand.

977
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:23,120
And then she just looks with the same weird look that she looked when the author said in the interview that his ambition was to become immortal and then die.

978
01:12:23,121 --> 01:12:27,120
And you get the same full-face camera, you get the same music.

979
01:12:27,121 --> 01:12:31,600
If you've seen it often, you get a feeling there must be some connection.

980
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:44,401
And the question is: is this blank look that she had with the author, and she's having now the complete incomprehension of what's going on, or some totally new way of looking at things?

981
01:12:44,720 --> 01:13:00,640
And you really don't know, but there's a clue that maybe she is beginning to understand become immortal and die because she picks up the bogey gesture, which Bogey passed on to Michelle, and Michelle passed on to her.

982
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:13,040
Maybe she understands that it's a step, this gesture is a kind of tribute to a certain style of life and that she's got it now.

983
01:13:13,201 --> 01:13:16,160
Maybe she's maybe, I mean, how does it end?

984
01:13:16,161 --> 01:13:19,680
Is that the first step toward her becoming an active nihilist?

985
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:21,600
It's completely ambiguous.

986
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:26,080
She just turns her back and walks away, and we just don't know.

987
01:13:26,401 --> 01:13:28,640
Anyway, that's the way it works, I think.

988
01:13:29,361 --> 01:13:32,240
That's what happens at the end of the movie.

989
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:41,361
And I think by that time you see that it has to be this question of whether she's disgusting or not and why she's disgusting.

990
01:13:41,361 --> 01:13:41,920
Yeah.

991
01:13:45,361 --> 01:13:48,600
I thought my first thought was like in the third man.

992
01:13:48,241 --> 01:13:51,000
Orson Welles.

993
01:13:54,201 --> 01:13:57,080
He's running away from death, but you might run away?

994
01:13:57,401 --> 01:13:59,161
No, I don't think he's running away from death.

995
01:13:59,161 --> 01:14:01,880
It wouldn't fit with him saying that he thinks about it all the time.

996
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,720
He tries it out in her lap.

997
01:14:04,441 --> 01:14:09,080
It's just another form of nothingness, and he thrives on nothingness.

998
01:14:09,081 --> 01:14:10,840
And he wants to live just go boo.

999
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:16,600
And, you know, again, it's the Bud Sufa, the last breath is live dangerously just to the end.

1000
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:19,160
And he's doing it perfectly.

1001
01:14:19,161 --> 01:14:22,840
So now you see, I hope, why I say it's Pop Nietzsche.

1002
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:27,960
I mean, it's certainly Nietzsche transposed into sort of comic book form or something like that.

1003
01:14:27,961 --> 01:14:32,520
But I think the hints are all over the place that Godard knows his Nietzsche.

1004
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:40,840
He made another movie later called The Gay Science, which turned out to be very uninteresting and didn't have much to do with Nietzsche.

1005
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:46,920
But let me say one more thing, because I still have about five minutes.

1006
01:14:47,241 --> 01:15:00,200
It's interesting to see, and I sort of hinted at that, the way in a good movie, or any work of art, presumably, but a movie it's clearest, the form ought to fit the story.

1007
01:15:00,201 --> 01:15:05,321
So Godard is playing with disorder and meaningfulness and turning it into poetry.

1008
01:15:05,321 --> 01:15:09,480
I read you the thing, Godard says, well, now all things are possible.

1009
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:12,520
Let's just try all things are possible in a movie.

1010
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:13,800
And what does that mean?

1011
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:18,840
Well, that means, as I said, no credits, very misleading, establishing shots.

1012
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:21,560
Could you understand at the beginning what was going on?

1013
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:34,040
You get a picture of the boats, you get a picture of him in the car, you get a picture of him behind the newspaper first, and then you get the boats, and then you get the car, and then you get the girl, and she's making signs, but it isn't clear that they're at him.

1014
01:15:34,161 --> 01:15:42,000
Everything, there's no establishing shot where you see the car, the boat, and him and the girl all at once, so you can see how they're related to each other.

1015
01:15:42,001 --> 01:15:43,281
Wasn't it very confusing?

1016
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:47,361
It took me, certainly the first time through, I had no idea what was going on.

1017
01:15:47,361 --> 01:15:49,200
And that's done on purpose.

1018
01:15:49,201 --> 01:15:59,201
And later, you get a lot of handheld hammer and jumpiness, and the camera moving around its most extreme form.

1019
01:15:59,201 --> 01:16:03,920
I guess Godard probably was the first to do this when he's in the travel agency.

1020
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:10,241
And you get this creepy thing because the camera does the whole full circle while on him.

1021
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,161
And so I don't know what it means.

1022
01:16:12,161 --> 01:16:15,361
It just means Godard is trying some playing around.

1023
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:30,321
And there's this funny scene where he runs out of the, when he goes to buy a newspaper, if you'll see it again, he runs out of the screen in one direction and he runs back into the next shot running in the opposite direction.

1024
01:16:30,321 --> 01:16:33,361
I mean, mismatch editing.

1025
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,080
Not incompetence, just craziness.

1026
01:16:36,081 --> 01:16:38,240
It's supposed to mix you up.

1027
01:16:39,441 --> 01:16:46,241
As it happens too that you see him in bed and then the next cut you see him coming out of the bathroom, but you never see him going into the bathroom.

1028
01:16:46,321 --> 01:16:48,160
That's not a well-made movie.

1029
01:16:48,161 --> 01:16:52,800
Everything is purposely confused.

1030
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:54,480
Okay, one more thing.

1031
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:54,640
Yeah.

1032
01:17:07,041 --> 01:17:11,041
Ah, I don't remember that, but it isn't a continuous dialogue.

1033
01:17:12,241 --> 01:17:17,041
It cuts bits of the dialogue between them and just doesn't explain why there are these blanks.

1034
01:17:17,041 --> 01:17:18,401
Yeah, that's the same thing.

1035
01:17:18,401 --> 01:17:26,200
And another thing which I wanted to mention, because you don't get it if you watch it with subtitles, is he really plays with you.

1036
01:17:26,201 --> 01:17:29,800
He does it twice, once visually and one acoustically.

1037
01:17:29,961 --> 01:17:31,321
You could see the visual one.

1038
01:17:31,321 --> 01:17:44,120
He sets it all up so that you think that you're going to see Eisenhower and you see all these motorcycles going by and then you see this big fancy car going by and you want to see who's in the car, but a tree gets in the way just at that moment and you don't see it.

1039
01:17:44,441 --> 01:18:10,281
What you don't get if you listen, which is funny, is he does this big thing on the where are the girls most beautiful and he's saying it isn't in Paris, it isn't in Stockholm, it isn't in London, it isn't in New York, it's in, and then a police siren goes by and you must have to listen to it a thousand times or have the script to know that it turns out to be Geneva and Lausanne.

1040
01:18:10,281 --> 01:18:23,880
But the point is, if you were listening, a normal viewer listening with all your might, you wouldn't hear the punchline, which you, if you're a guy particularly, you want to know in what city the women are most beautiful, you don't get to find out.

1041
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:26,201
And that's just all the ways he plays with you.

1042
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:33,000
It's not a finished, rational film with all the details in their right place and where everything happens for a why.

1043
01:18:33,401 --> 01:18:35,000
You have to put it together.

1044
01:18:35,001 --> 01:18:41,880
Like an active nihilist, you have to enjoy some kind of new freedom that you get from this disorder.

1045
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:45,720
And you have to make sense out of it as you please.

1046
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:51,720
I guess that's all I want to say about that.

1047
01:18:51,720 --> 01:19:20,880
That the style sort of tries to force you into a world where there isn't an answer to the why, and where either you come away from the movie Annoyed that it's so sort of badly made and leaves all these questions unanswered, in which case you're disgusting because you're some kind of old-fashioned, you're still under the haven't recognized the death of God, or you come out of the movie thinking, wow, that's exhilarating.

1048
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:24,720
That's a whole new way of being able to make and see a movie.

1049
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:28,480
That's what I think happened to you, and it's certainly what happened to me.

1050
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:29,920
And I hope you enjoyed it.

1051
01:19:30,321 --> 01:19:33,441
Okay, we're going, and back to Nietzsche next time.
