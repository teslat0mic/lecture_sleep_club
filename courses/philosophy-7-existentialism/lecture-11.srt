1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,040
But the only way I know to plunge into it after years of trying to unscramble it and teach it, so that now I think I understand it pretty well, is to put it back in the framework of the Greeks versus the Judeo-Christians, because not only do they have a big different view about epistemology and metaphysics and ethics, but they have a totally different view of the self.

2
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:35,521
And that's, and I don't think anybody before Kierkegaard ever fully saw this big difference.

3
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:46,240
As you'll see when I talk about it, Pascal sort of saw it, because Pascal was a genius who sort of saw everything about existential things way before anybody else.

4
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,521
But here we go.

5
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:54,041
So the Greek view, the self, and you don't have anything about that on your pages yet.

6
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm giving you the background for looking at these pages.

7
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:11,640
So on the Greek view, particularly in Plato, human beings were an unstable combination of body and soul.

8
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:24,521
And the body part was in time, and the soul part was merged with the ideas, these abstract whatever's that people are still worrying about trying to decide what they were.

9
00:01:24,521 --> 00:01:33,881
But something or other outside of time, something eternal, that the eternal part of the self could contemplate and merge with.

10
00:01:34,521 --> 00:01:50,201
And the basic idea in Plato, particularly, is that you're an unstable combination of these two, the body and the soul.

11
00:01:50,201 --> 00:02:11,321
And in order to make that unstable combination stable and livable, and to lead a harmonious life instead of a life sort of struggling back and forth between the body and the soul, you need to find out which part is really essentially you and get rid of the other part.

12
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:31,401
Of course, they don't come sort of labeled like one of them, namely contemplating eternal, say, mathematical and philosophical things is what's really you, and your body is just getting in the way, or that your body is really you, and this kind of contemplation just gets in the way.

13
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:48,560
It's up to you to take a stand on yourself as one or the other, and to then minimize and repress or whatever, get rid of or declare unessential the other part.

14
00:02:48,560 --> 00:03:14,160
So, for Plato, when you realize you have an eternal soul, then, and you will learn to emphasize the kind of contemplation you do with the soul, and you will, to talk like Plato or Socrates, Socrates saying, that the philosopher, Socrates quoting Plato as saying, the philosopher should die to their body.

15
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:32,321
That means that not only philosophers, but mathematicians and nowadays, the kind of programmer that I talked about who would like to be rid of his body so that he could sort of program that which was the important thing to do and the best part of himself all the time, not get hungry and so forth.

16
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:37,281
So Plato says, die to your body, do philosophy.

17
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,521
But there are other people.

18
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:45,920
I just pick a Roman philosopher, Lucretius, who I write on the board if I knew how to spell it.

19
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,920
I think I know how to spell it, but my computer says I don't.

20
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,600
So it's probably right.

21
00:03:54,881 --> 00:04:02,321
I think it's L-U-C-R-E-E-I-U-S.

22
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:03,680
Is that what you guys think?

23
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,081
So much the worse for my computer then.

24
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:06,641
Okay.

25
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:16,480
So Lucretius, a Roman, I take it, okay, thought that we were just made up of atoms, which jiggled around.

26
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,401
He was way ahead of his time.

27
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:30,680
And he thought that what we ought to do was try to get the atoms we're made up to jiggle around in the most pleasant and unupsetting and most coherent way.

28
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:44,920
And the only thing that keeps us from being able to do that is all these religious superstitions and these mathematical people like Plato who tell you that the body isn't important and that you should contemplate these eternal things.

29
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,401
Lucretius thought just the opposite.

30
00:04:47,401 --> 00:05:14,360
You should identify yourself with these natural needs and with your body and ignore the bother that comes from these religious and philosophical superstitions that there's something more important or that you are more than just this material object that could be in a certain way sort of optimized if only it didn't have these wild ideas that come from somewhere else.

31
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:37,321
So, and once you realize you are either an eternal soul and play down the body, or vice versa, that you're a body that ignores these souly things, then this instability is overcome, these two pulls on you, and you can live a happy life.

32
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:44,521
But that, in other words, you have to relate yourself to yourself in a negative way.

33
00:05:44,521 --> 00:06:07,521
That is, not that you have to think about whether you're a body or a soul, but you either have to behave in such a way that have to, that is, if you want to have a peaceful, harmonious life and not be yanked back and forth all the time, you have to either repress, deny, and negate one aspect or the other, the body or the soul.

34
00:06:08,881 --> 00:06:11,761
That's the roughly Greek idea.

35
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,201
I'm calling it Greek.

36
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,841
It's really mostly Plato.

37
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:29,521
And so if you do it right, life is a voyage from confusion to clarity, from conflict between these two aspects to harmony.

38
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:32,561
And the soul is potentially harmonious.

39
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:41,121
All it has to do is realize its true nature and get rid of the other half, the inessential part, whichever way you go.

40
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:55,441
If you satisfy your essential needs and get rid of what are these confusing and superficial dreams or desires, then you experience peace and fulfillment.

41
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,441
That's the promise.

42
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:04,801
And that worked well for lots and lots of people, presumably in antiquity, in Greece and in Rome.

43
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,801
But you should be used to this now.

44
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,001
There's another perspective, obviously, that thinks that is all wrong.

45
00:07:12,241 --> 00:07:18,160
There's, of course, the Judeo-Christian existentialist perspective.

46
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:24,081
That is, they say, but the body and the soul are equally essential.

47
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:27,601
That's why, for instance, God has to get a body.

48
00:07:27,601 --> 00:07:32,481
And when he becomes incarnate, literally embodied in Jesus.

49
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:42,401
The Hebrews don't have this choice between sitting back and contemplating or getting sort of bodily involved.

50
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:46,001
They are totally involved all the time.

51
00:07:46,721 --> 00:07:51,881
But they're doing it and they are still related to God some way.

52
00:07:48,881 --> 00:07:56,200
But it's much more harder to spell out what's going on.

53
00:07:57,241 --> 00:08:05,401
Clearly, you need both, a soul and a body, and not just as two extra two pieces, which are both important.

54
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:09,961
They are integrated in such a way that you couldn't have one without the other.

55
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:21,561
They're so integrated that in Dante, he has a problem about what about these souls who die before the time when they, for one thing, everybody will get their body back at the final day of judgment.

56
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,521
How else?

57
00:08:22,521 --> 00:08:25,561
Because they really aren't complete without their body.

58
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:43,801
But in the meantime, God gives them a kind of loner body, which they have in paradise and hell, waiting for the day when they'll get their real bodies back, when they will finally be complete and the people in hell will suffer more, and the people in paradise will be happier because they'll be whole.

59
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:49,081
But they don't fit together, these two aspects.

60
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,361
Think of the aspects.

61
00:08:50,361 --> 00:09:01,160
One way to think about them is one side of the self is busy acting in the world and another side of the self is reflecting and contemplating.

62
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,241
These are both important things the self can do.

63
00:09:05,241 --> 00:09:08,761
But if you, when you're trying to do one, the other one gets in the way.

64
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:12,440
If you try to contemplate, then you better get out of your active involvement.

65
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,681
And if you try to be actively involved, you better not contemplate.

66
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,840
I think this is a big problem in Aristotle.

67
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,360
How many of that 25A?

68
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,040
No, not very many.

69
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,881
I mean, Aristotle seems to say that the highest life is contemplation.

70
00:09:25,881 --> 00:09:29,801
And then he also seems to say that the highest life is political involvement.

71
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:38,241
And then people for 2,000 years, as far as I could tell, have been trying to write the articles and books trying to get these two together.

72
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,961
But I think they don't go together very well in the antique world.

73
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:53,441
And so Pascal sees this and sees that we are in the Judeo-Christian tradition, or at least he is.

74
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,401
And in that tradition, he says, what a monster then is man.

75
00:09:58,721 --> 00:10:00,001
What a chaos.

76
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:01,761
What a contradiction.

77
00:10:01,761 --> 00:10:07,681
Judge of all things, imbecile worm of the earth, the pride and refuse of the universe.

78
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,320
That's pretty dramatic.

79
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,560
And it isn't exactly mappable onto what I've been saying.

80
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:26,881
But the important thing is, Pascal is saying that we are a contradiction, which is not at all like a combination in which you can just take either the soul or the body side.

81
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:33,201
It's like we're a contradiction because we have to do justice to both sides.

82
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,080
We are essentially body and essentially soul.

83
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,920
You can't just decide which one you really are and dump the other.

84
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:54,241
And so Pascal thinks the highest thing people can do isn't to overcome the contradiction by getting rid of half, but you live in such a way as to fully express the tension in the contradiction.

85
00:10:54,241 --> 00:11:04,961
You can begin to see already, as usual, that Pascal is on to sort of anguish is going to turn out to be the sort of test of whether you are really a full human being.

86
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:14,081
He says, we do not display greatness by going to one extreme, but in touching both at once and filling all the intervening space.

87
00:11:14,401 --> 00:11:48,601
So instead of trying to purify the self of one half or the other to find peace and happiness, which was the Greek way, Pascal thinks that avoids the tension, the contradiction, the living stretched out between these extremes, constantly sort of alive to what looks like the impossibility of living fully, expressing both these contradictory things.

88
00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:55,241
So Pascal thinks it's a kind of cop-out to try to purify yourself of one or the other half.

89
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:58,601
Purifying is repressing or denying.

90
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:07,401
Now you'll see, all of this is not just interesting because it helps explain Kierkegaard, as you'll see in a minute, but I'm pointing ahead to the brothers.

91
00:12:07,401 --> 00:12:14,920
The brothers, Dostoevsky has an exactly identical view of the self that Kierkegaard has, though I don't think he got it from Kierkegaard.

92
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,001
I think they both got it from Pascal and did their own thing on it.

93
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:31,001
But there is one of the brothers who is trying to purify himself to make himself perfectly goal and get rid of the sensual, as he calls it.

94
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:35,961
And Pascal thinks that doing that is very dangerous.

95
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,601
He says man is neither simply angel or simply brute.

96
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,321
And the unfortunate thing is that he would act the angel act.

97
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,681
That is, if you're trying to be perfect, you're dangerous.

98
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,881
Keep your eye on the brothers, and ask yourself which one that's about.

99
00:12:54,201 --> 00:13:03,241
And so the goal of Pascal isn't happiness and peace, which you get by getting rid of one outside or the other.

100
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:06,241
It's this kind of aliveness.

101
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:11,121
Fulfillment is not a Greekish idea.

102
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:19,601
It's not, the Judeo-Christian idea is not some kind of fulfillment where you just finally arrive at happiness.

103
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:28,641
The bliss has to go with anguish for Kierkegaard and for Pascal, and for Pascal and for Kierkegaard, let's put it that way.

104
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,361
And so what do you do?

105
00:13:33,361 --> 00:13:35,121
Well, you've got a big problem.

106
00:13:35,121 --> 00:13:49,521
He thinks that you oscillate back and forth between pride in the part that's the contemplative soul part, and despair at being this lowly animal.

107
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:51,761
Remember, the pride and refuse of the universe.

108
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:59,920
So you're proud of being the pride of the universe and you're humiliated at being the refuse of the universe, and that's despair.

109
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,361
Now, what do you do about it?

110
00:14:01,361 --> 00:14:04,081
Well, here's where Pascal didn't have much to say.

111
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,840
And this is where Kierkegaard takes over.

112
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:21,120
Pascal says, well, Jesus had the extremist reasons to be proud, since he was God, and to be humble, since he was a lowly person who was washing the feet of Mary Magdalene.

113
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:28,400
And he managed to live in these extremes without pride and without humiliation.

114
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,920
And all we have to do is imitate him.

115
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,081
Well, that's not very helpful, it seems to me.

116
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:40,960
And I've read all of the Pascal that's relevant, and I don't see any more clues as to what we're supposed to do in there.

117
00:14:41,241 --> 00:14:44,641
Then, so the question is: well, what do you do when you imitate him?

118
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,840
How does he do it?

119
00:14:45,840 --> 00:15:03,160
Get the two contradictory aspects together in a way that doesn't lead to conflict and bouncing back and forth between pride and humiliation and doesn't lead to despair, but get the two aspects of the self together in a way that they reinforce each other.

120
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:07,481
And so that you have more of one, the more of one, the more of the other.

121
00:15:07,481 --> 00:15:09,241
That's what you need.

122
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:13,880
That's what Kierkegaard's going to tell you now how to get.

123
00:15:14,201 --> 00:15:15,720
So that was a preamble.

124
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,241
If you want to say, this is a good time to do it.

125
00:15:19,241 --> 00:15:28,521
Because from now on, we're going to read line by line this complicated story, which is a summary of everything we said about Kierkegaard.

126
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:35,880
A summary in the most condensed and abstract form you could possibly imagine.

127
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,321
But anyway, so far so good.

128
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,360
I don't expect any.

129
00:15:38,441 --> 00:15:40,440
There's nothing to disagree about yet.

130
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:41,001
Okay?

131
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:58,440
And so now we turn to this clear and condensed, and I admit, incomprehensible writing on despair, which is, and the subject of this is, what is the self?

132
00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:04,681
And just an aside, which I think is funny, I mean, this is as you, how many have tried to read it?

133
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:09,960
I presume, since I gave it out, that you couldn't resist your curiosity and try to read it.

134
00:16:09,961 --> 00:16:12,521
And I don't know what kind of reaction you had.

135
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:16,840
I think when I first read it, I just thought my head would fall off or something.

136
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,521
I couldn't understand a thing.

137
00:16:18,521 --> 00:16:20,840
But at least I never thought it was a joke.

138
00:16:21,641 --> 00:16:32,521
Some amazingly arrogant critics and writers of Kierkegaard, who think they're on his side, so to speak, explain this passage by saying, well, no wonder you can't understand it.

139
00:16:32,521 --> 00:16:33,720
It's not meant to be understood.

140
00:16:33,721 --> 00:16:34,281
It's a joke.

141
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,400
It's a parody of Hegel.

142
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,001
Boy, is that wrong.

143
00:16:38,001 --> 00:16:44,241
And unbelievable on the part of an interpreter to think that if you can't understand it, it must be a joke.

144
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:55,681
It happens to be, and it's important to tell you, in this book of Kierkegaard's called Sickness Unto Death, which is a book about the self and despair, which is written by a pseudonym.

145
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,200
Remember, Kierkegaard's always writing them under other people's names.

146
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:03,521
The pseudonym is the name for the person who is a better Christian than Kierkegaard.

147
00:17:03,521 --> 00:17:15,120
I told you, there are two books by Kierkegaard in which he tells you what he really, what he thinks the right, really true Christian way of life is.

148
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,400
And this passage appears in that book.

149
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,281
And that was no joking matter, that book.

150
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:26,001
And it certainly wasn't going to suddenly break off and start parodying Hegel.

151
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:26,960
So here we go.

152
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:28,961
And he is very influenced by Hegel.

153
00:17:29,201 --> 00:17:30,640
He uses Hegel's language.

154
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,360
We saw immediate and mediation and higher immediacy and so forth.

155
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:45,921
Well, this is Kierkegaard taking over and transforming Hegel, because Hegel was a philosopher and didn't get it right, according to Kierkegaard.

156
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:48,320
Okay, so let's read the first paragraph.

157
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,560
The human being is spirit.

158
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,160
But what is spirit?

159
00:17:52,161 --> 00:17:53,601
Spirit is the self.

160
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,281
But what is the self?

161
00:17:55,281 --> 00:18:02,160
The self is a relation which relates itself to itself, or that in the relation which is its relating to itself.

162
00:18:02,721 --> 00:18:03,601
This is getting good.

163
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,680
The self is not the relation, but the relation's relation to itself.

164
00:18:08,481 --> 00:18:10,880
That's already a pretty hard point.

165
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:18,560
What that says is what a human being is, is the stand that they take on themselves.

166
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:26,840
We just heard the Greeks' way of relating to themselves was either to deny the soul part or deny the body part.

167
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,241
There are other ways of relating to the self.

168
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:36,281
Pascal thought you could get it together somehow by relating to the God-man in the right way.

169
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:50,201
In any case, what it is to be a self isn't just to be a set of factors, to talk in his language, but it's the way these set of factors take a stand on being, this set of factors.

170
00:18:50,201 --> 00:18:53,241
That's what that's going on and on about, relating itself to itself.

171
00:18:53,241 --> 00:18:58,840
It turns out to be very important for all existentialist understandings.

172
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:08,281
Heidegger, the other important existentialist I teach, says that human beings are the being whose being is an issue for them.

173
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:13,640
That's Heidegger just taking over Kierkegaard and saying it in other terms.

174
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,521
So let's go on, because there's lots to be filled in yet.

175
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:25,080
A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis.

176
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,521
Well, that's important.

177
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:30,120
A synthesis, not a combination.

178
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,680
A combination is what the Greeks have.

179
00:19:32,681 --> 00:19:43,640
The body there, sort of stuck with, well, the soul is to put it this way, stuck with a body, or the body having all these crazy superstitions and kind of stuck with a soul.

180
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,241
But you can take them apart.

181
00:19:45,241 --> 00:19:47,080
They're just a combination.

182
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:52,840
But a synthesis, the way Kierkegaard's using it is, is the two parts require each other.

183
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,241
That you can't have one without the other.

184
00:19:55,481 --> 00:19:57,321
That's what it is to be a human being.

185
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,320
It's to be this combination.

186
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,040
Well, a combination is just the wrong word.

187
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:15,600
It's to be this synthesis, this totally integrated somehow, but contradictory to something or other that has to take a stand on itself being that way.

188
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,360
Okay, so by the way, let me just correct Kierkegaard here for a minute.

189
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,040
I've always annoyed.

190
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:27,040
This is the way he wrote it, but if he were writing it in, if I were reading his paper, I would correct it at this point.

191
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,080
A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and eternal.

192
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,720
Do you find something confusing about that?

193
00:20:34,721 --> 00:20:38,400
You recognize sort of what parallelism is when you're writing?

194
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,400
He should say of the infinite and the finite, of the eternal and the temporal.

195
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,640
He should lay them out all the same way.

196
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,840
You can correct it.

197
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,761
You can do better than Kierkegaard on that.

198
00:20:47,761 --> 00:20:52,961
So it's a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the eternal and the temporal, of freedom and necessity.

199
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:56,481
There he's back in the parallel again.

200
00:20:56,481 --> 00:20:58,160
In short, a synthesis.

201
00:20:58,161 --> 00:21:00,640
Now get ready for the next mind-blowing thing.

202
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,360
A synthesis is a relation between two terms.

203
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,640
Looked at in this way, the human being is not yet a self.

204
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,360
Good grief.

205
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:15,761
We've just spent a whole paragraph presumably defining the self, and now that it looks like we finished this paragraph, turns out we haven't defined the self.

206
00:21:15,761 --> 00:21:19,040
What we've done, look at the diagram on the back.

207
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,920
What we've gotten so far is R1 in the diagram.

208
00:21:23,921 --> 00:21:37,680
That is, this human being, which is a synthesis, though it doesn't know what to do with it yet, of, and then I've got the finite, temporal, necessary, and the infinite, eternal, possible.

209
00:21:38,001 --> 00:21:43,440
And you can see at the bottom of that picture that the soul and the body are in there.

210
00:21:43,441 --> 00:21:46,241
They're sort of the Greek version.

211
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:56,840
But Heidegger never, sorry, Kierkegaard never will say soul and body, because it seems too much like you can take them apart, that when the body dies, the soul goes on, and so forth.

212
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:11,160
But he's got his own names for the aspect of the body, that's the important thing, namely finite, temporal, and necessary, and the aspect of the soul, which is the important thing.

213
00:22:11,161 --> 00:22:17,560
Only these two sets of factors, as he calls them, have to be together.

214
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,200
You can't define them apart from each other.

215
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:21,961
He's going to explain.

216
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,521
Now, so far, first paragraph.

217
00:22:24,521 --> 00:22:26,200
Any problems yet?

218
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,160
It gets worse.

219
00:22:29,161 --> 00:22:30,120
You will see.

220
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,800
Okay, here we go.

221
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,160
In fact, it's the next paragraph, which to me is the hardest.

222
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:42,920
I don't really quite understand why he says what he says the way he's saying it here, but I know what he's saying.

223
00:22:42,921 --> 00:22:43,800
So I'll read it.

224
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:49,880
In a relation between two things, the relation is the third term in the form of a negative unity.

225
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,720
And the two relate to the relation and in the relation to that relation.

226
00:22:53,721 --> 00:23:00,521
This is what it is from the point of view of soul or soul and body to be in relation.

227
00:23:00,521 --> 00:23:06,761
If, on the other hand, the relation relates itself to itself, then this relation is the positive third term, and this is the self.

228
00:23:07,161 --> 00:23:08,600
That really is everything.

229
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,281
That's the whole story.

230
00:23:11,161 --> 00:23:13,560
But what in the world is going on there?

231
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,161
Well, I've told you that story.

232
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:21,320
I think maybe some of you, having heard what I just said earlier, could figure this out.

233
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:26,920
What is the negative relation of the self relating to itself?

234
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,040
I bet somebody understands.

235
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:38,560
Have we talked about a negative relation of the self relating to itself when we talked about the Greeks?

236
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:42,721
Makes me a little worried.

237
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:43,360
Yeah.

238
00:23:45,921 --> 00:23:46,720
That's half of it.

239
00:23:46,721 --> 00:23:48,560
But why would you call that a negative relation?

240
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,360
That's only the thing you haven't quite got it to help him.

241
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,321
What's the negative?

242
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,200
Yeah.

243
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,681
That's it.

244
00:23:55,681 --> 00:24:00,800
It's a relation in which you define yourself by repressing half of yourself.

245
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,641
That's a way of relating to yourself, which is a negative relation.

246
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,640
That was the first clue I got.

247
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:15,521
Notice that in all this abstract talk, the only example he gives is that is what, from the point of view of soul, for soul and body to be in relation.

248
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:18,481
That was my clue once upon a time.

249
00:24:18,481 --> 00:24:24,001
And that relation is, could be any of these things.

250
00:24:24,001 --> 00:24:33,600
But he gives you one of the ways it could be, this relation could work, is that you deny half of the combination, and that's what he's talking about.

251
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:42,001
Then if, on the other hand, the relation relates itself, relates to itself, then this whole self, you could write in there.

252
00:24:42,001 --> 00:24:42,800
That would help.

253
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:52,640
If, on the other hand, the relation relates to its whole self instead of just repressing, then this relation is the positive term, and this is the self.

254
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,001
Okay, what's that look like?

255
00:24:54,001 --> 00:24:58,320
Go back over here, and you'll see that's R2.

256
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,840
R2 is supposed to be the relation relating itself to itself.

257
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,481
That's what I write, try to put this circle around.

258
00:25:06,481 --> 00:25:10,241
I'm sure this can be improved upon, but this is the best I can do.

259
00:25:10,961 --> 00:25:18,080
So now we've got R1 is just there is this set of factors which is a synthesis.

260
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:25,321
R2 is the set of factors takes a stand on itself and tries to deal with itself being a synthesis.

261
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:31,720
And now it can do it, it turns out, in a negative form or a positive form.

262
00:25:31,721 --> 00:25:33,960
Now we have to talk about that.

263
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:42,440
And that's really in the italics at the top of the description.

264
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:44,201
Because there you're going to hear about the forms.

265
00:25:44,201 --> 00:25:48,920
Despair is a sickness of the spirit, of the self, and can have three forms.

266
00:25:48,921 --> 00:25:53,160
Being unconscious in the despair of having a self.

267
00:25:53,161 --> 00:25:54,360
That's R1.

268
00:25:54,681 --> 00:26:11,080
That means that the person in R1 doesn't even know they've got a problem, doesn't know they have to take a stand on themselves, and doesn't know that this is very hard to do because it's hard to the two sides don't seem to fit together.

269
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:23,481
You will find somebody, as you begin to read the Brothers Karamatsov, ask yourself, who is in the unconscious of the despair of having a self.

270
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:37,481
And you can make yourself unconscious of it by drinking or running around with lots of women or watching TV all the time or being absorbed in computer games.

271
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:45,320
My son is of the final, of that last sort.

272
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,800
I know it well.

273
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,920
Anyway, so what was I going to say about it?

274
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:58,360
Oh, yeah, for Pascal, remember the two examples I mentioned were distracting yourself by playing tennis.

275
00:26:58,521 --> 00:27:03,481
Little does he know how much nicer that is than sitting alone at home and playing computer games.

276
00:27:03,481 --> 00:27:08,481
But anyway, and the other one was sitting at home alone doing geometry.

277
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,521
That's his little jibe at Descartes, as I said.

278
00:27:11,521 --> 00:27:28,481
I mean, that's another way to try to forget the problem that you're supposed to take an active stand on yourself and go out and do something is sit alone in a warm room with no passions, Descartes says, and do philosophy or do mathematics.

279
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:32,961
And those are all ways of not facing up.

280
00:27:33,761 --> 00:27:37,680
Those are always to make yourself unconscious of the problem.

281
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:45,680
Try to forget what a difficult thing it is to be a human being and what you're called to do and how hard it is to do it.

282
00:27:45,681 --> 00:27:50,880
Okay, now, but let's go on with the top italics.

283
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,721
There's being unconscious in the despair of having a self.

284
00:27:54,721 --> 00:27:57,761
This is all put in the weirdest, awkward form.

285
00:27:57,761 --> 00:28:06,720
That really means, I would say, being unconscious of having a self and being sort of in despair.

286
00:28:06,721 --> 00:28:10,320
Because you're not really in despair because you don't even know you've got a problem.

287
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:18,001
Then comes one that's clearer: not wanting, even this one isn't too clear, not wanting in despair to be oneself.

288
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:30,640
That is, if you rewrite it, something like being in despair by not wanting to be oneself, or being in despair at not wanting.

289
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:37,681
I can see that it's hard to do, and it's a challenge, given five words to put them in the right order to describe this.

290
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:44,961
But what's going on there is: well, let me ask you: do you recognize it in this cryptic form?

291
00:28:44,961 --> 00:28:48,320
Not wanting in despair to be oneself?

292
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,161
Try now.

293
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:51,241
Does that sound familiar?

294
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:53,080
It's really in code, yeah.

295
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:02,121
That's great.

296
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,680
You got it.

297
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,361
I feel happy that the message is getting across.

298
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:19,320
Yeah, that's another version of the negative R2: not wanting to be oneself, and you're going to be in despair because you give up trying to get the whole self together.

299
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:24,761
So that's going to be which one of the brothers is in that condition?

300
00:29:24,761 --> 00:29:27,400
That's the same brother who's trying to be perfect.

301
00:29:27,721 --> 00:29:29,560
And then we have to see.

302
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,761
And wanting in despair to be oneself.

303
00:29:32,761 --> 00:29:42,120
Well, that means trying with all your might to get the two sides together and not being able to do it.

304
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:47,241
Because nobody on their own can get the two sets of factors together.

305
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:56,120
But there's one of the brothers who is trying with all his might to get the two factors together and is in despair because he sees that he can't do it.

306
00:29:56,441 --> 00:30:01,241
Okay, now we can go back, I think, to where we are.

307
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,440
Well, maybe not.

308
00:30:02,441 --> 00:30:04,120
Let me make sure here.

309
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,400
So we've done R1.

310
00:30:07,721 --> 00:30:14,600
We've done the fact that the self is a combination.

311
00:30:14,921 --> 00:30:16,920
Have one without the other.

312
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,160
I'm just reading what I said to me crooked because it's so dense I don't want to leave anything out.

313
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:15,120
Another way to put it is what I was saying when you can't you why you can't get them together the factors is that they are contradictory or at least if you don't get the right relation to them they're contradictory so that you can't just say I'm gonna just put them together.

314
00:31:15,121 --> 00:31:18,721
There isn't any direct way for you to put them together.

315
00:31:18,721 --> 00:31:20,640
That's what I'm gonna get to in a minute.

316
00:31:23,761 --> 00:31:38,080
You can't I wrote here express your bodily finite needs and capacities at the same fully at the same time fully expressing all your intellectual needs and spiritual religious needs and capacities.

317
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,521
Or to put it another way you can't be fully involved and fully detached at the same time.

318
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,161
In fact the more you express one the less you're able to express the other.

319
00:31:48,161 --> 00:31:58,561
If you try to fulfill both you can try to fulfill both completely but that struggle won't work and that and you'll realize you're in despair.

320
00:31:58,561 --> 00:32:04,881
So all of the cases we discussed so far are this in despair.

321
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:11,361
Now comes the, let's see where we are.

322
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:23,561
So such a relation which relates to itself, it relates to itself, that is a self, itself or been established by something else.

323
00:32:24,761 --> 00:32:33,240
Now, it's interesting what that says that this is not so important, but I'll just say it.

324
00:32:33,241 --> 00:32:41,961
Kierkegaard thinks it's important that you can't get this together by yourself because it shows that something else must have made you.

325
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:50,921
Because if you had made yourself, you ought to be able to, so to speak, make yourself in a way that works better or make yourself strong enough to fix it or something.

326
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:59,081
There's something going on about being a self which isn't in the power of the self.

327
00:32:59,081 --> 00:33:02,681
Something about the self which comes from outside the self, he says.

328
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:08,601
You can see that from the despair of trying to get it together on your own.

329
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:18,040
Then comes if the relation which relates to itself has been constituted by another, then of course the relation is the third term.

330
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:25,641
But then this relation, the third term, is a relation which relates in turn to that which has established the whole relation.

331
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,361
Do you recognize that?

332
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,840
What he's talking about there in this very, very abstract way?

333
00:33:33,161 --> 00:33:46,040
A kind of relation which relates itself to another and thereby establishes the whole relation and makes it work?

334
00:33:46,681 --> 00:33:47,641
Yeah.

335
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,681
Exactly.

336
00:33:50,681 --> 00:33:53,881
That's code for unconditional commitment.

337
00:33:53,880 --> 00:34:00,201
The self relates itself to itself by relating to, as he puts it, something else.

338
00:34:00,241 --> 00:34:01,240
We'll in a minute.

339
00:34:01,721 --> 00:34:04,320
He's very, very abstract about it.

340
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:10,721
But if you look on the picture, that's R3, which is the unconditional commitment.

341
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:15,921
And now we go back and read more of this.

342
00:34:17,761 --> 00:34:19,601
I'm going to go on with it.

343
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:26,641
But I think I'll skip to the bottom line just because you got it so close to right now.

344
00:34:26,641 --> 00:34:33,361
This then is the formula which describes the state of the self when despair is completely eradicated.

345
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:40,800
In relating to itself and wanting to be itself, the self is grounded transparently in the power that constituted it.

346
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,560
No, it's too early to say that.

347
00:34:42,561 --> 00:34:44,640
That won't make any sense to you at all.

348
00:34:45,601 --> 00:34:48,000
But so let's get there step by step.

349
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,520
He was right to put it at the end.

350
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,800
Okay, such a derived, we've got to read this big paragraph in the meantime.

351
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:59,681
Such a derived constituted relation is the self, a relation which relates to itself and in relating to itself relates to another.

352
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:00,800
That's fine.

353
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,120
You now know what that is.

354
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,680
That is why there can be two forms of despair, authentic despair.

355
00:35:07,681 --> 00:35:14,561
If the human self were self-established, there would only be a question of one form, not wanting to be itself, wanting to be rid of itself.

356
00:35:14,561 --> 00:35:17,201
That's repressing the self.

357
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:18,641
That's the Greek version.

358
00:35:18,641 --> 00:35:24,161
There could be no question of wanting in despair to be oneself.

359
00:35:24,161 --> 00:35:31,601
That is, you could be, if you did it, I've said this already, if you were self-made, you could fix it.

360
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:47,760
This latter formula is the expression of the relation's self's total dependence, the expression of the fact that the self can't not by itself arrive at or remain in equilibrium, but only in relating to itself by relating to that which has established the whole relation.

361
00:35:47,761 --> 00:35:49,281
Well, I do have to talk about it.

362
00:35:49,561 --> 00:36:03,961
I take it that what established the whole relation, he doesn't say created, he says constituted, he says established, and I don't understand where he says, but somewhere he says, and you have to relate to something.

363
00:36:04,281 --> 00:36:05,560
And I was, oh, yeah, here it is.

364
00:36:05,561 --> 00:36:10,121
Like, you know, he's very, you know, where is it?

365
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:22,520
Because the something is important to me because relating to that means it could be a cause, it could, it could be any defining relation.

366
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,921
It doesn't mean a particular person.

367
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,200
Where is he?

368
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,041
Do you see that?

369
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:28,681
Did I make it?

370
00:36:28,761 --> 00:36:29,560
I'm sure.

371
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:37,881
I wonder if it's something that dropped out of the translation, the one we're reading, because I used to read it in a different translation.

372
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,400
Well, I don't see it right now.

373
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,641
I'll go back and tell you next time.

374
00:36:45,641 --> 00:36:50,520
But he does say that you could be related to something outside the self.

375
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:56,600
That's nice, because you don't want him to say it has to be Dante relating to Beatrice.

376
00:36:56,601 --> 00:37:00,201
It could be Martin Luther King relating to his cause.

377
00:37:00,201 --> 00:37:07,240
We've already seen that unconditional commitments can be anything outside the self.

378
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:10,920
Indeed, so far, I'm in the middle of that big paragraph now.

379
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:19,161
Indeed, so far from it's being simply the case that the second form of despair, wanting in despair to be oneself, amounts to a special form on its own, all despair.

380
00:37:19,161 --> 00:37:20,520
Oh, yeah, never mind that.

381
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,600
I'm going to skip that for a while.

382
00:37:21,761 --> 00:37:23,161
Just a second.

383
00:37:24,121 --> 00:37:25,961
Yeah, none of that.

384
00:37:31,721 --> 00:37:34,281
Get it to the last sentence, I guess we can read.

385
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:42,960
The imbalance in despair is not a simple imbalance, but an imbalance in a relation that relates to itself and which is constituted by another.

386
00:37:43,281 --> 00:37:44,561
That's what I want.

387
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,000
I knew it was somewhere.

388
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,481
Constituted by another is very, very abstract.

389
00:37:50,480 --> 00:38:12,001
It means not created, and it doesn't mean it has to be another person, but any kind of other outside the self can, if the conditions are right, constitute you as a self, constitute this human being as a self.

390
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,840
It's easiest to see with something like Beatrice and Dante.

391
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:21,840
So Beatrice is the other, so the something, what was it, the another.

392
00:38:22,161 --> 00:38:27,041
And Dante has an unconditional commitment to Beatrice.

393
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:29,600
But Dante doesn't create himself as a self.

394
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:42,641
It's Beatrice, who is the Savior, who gives him, who pulls him by her beauty in his story, to have an unconditional commitment for her.

395
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,121
And thereby, Beatrice gives Dante his identity.

396
00:38:47,761 --> 00:38:53,281
He becomes the great love poet of all times, the love poet of Beatrice.

397
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,721
So Martin Luther King gets called by the injustices to the black people.

398
00:38:58,721 --> 00:39:14,000
He responds to that call, that vocation, and that constitutes him, gives him an identity as the prophet bringing justice now to his people.

399
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:33,241
So this is just an abstract way of saying the defining commitment is what makes, what creates you as an individual and gives you an identity with the same thing.

400
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,401
And he wants to say it in this very abstract way.

401
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:51,160
Because this another could be Jesus too, turning Saul into Paul and giving him the identity of having to run around all of his melon world telling people about what isn't called Christianity yet.

402
00:39:51,161 --> 00:39:56,601
I don't know what it was called in those days, this strange new thing that just happened, and so forth.

403
00:39:56,601 --> 00:39:59,241
Okay, so it's constituted by another.

404
00:39:59,241 --> 00:40:04,761
So the lack of balance in that for-it-self relationship reflects itself.

405
00:40:04,761 --> 00:40:06,040
Now we don't need that.

406
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:07,241
No, never mind.

407
00:40:07,561 --> 00:40:10,840
Infinite elimination is the power of the.

408
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:25,241
I think that means you have infinite passion for whatever it is, this other outside of you, that gives you, by pulling on you, by calling you, this new identity.

409
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,880
Okay, now we're ready to read the last sentence.

410
00:40:29,081 --> 00:40:34,761
This then is the formula which describes the state of the self when despair is completely eradicated.

411
00:40:34,761 --> 00:40:43,081
In relating to itself and wanting to be itself, the self is grounded transparently in the power that constituted it.

412
00:40:43,081 --> 00:40:46,200
Well, grounded transparently, I need to explain now.

413
00:40:46,201 --> 00:40:53,161
That's Kierkegaard jargon for everything this person does shows that.

414
00:40:54,761 --> 00:41:04,561
It's, if I put it here, grounded transparently, he acts in such a way that what gives you your identity shows through in everything you do.

415
00:41:04,121 --> 00:41:09,121
I tried to write it in such a way as you could see why you could call it transparently grounded.

416
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:15,040
Everything you do manifests that you are the lover of Beatrice, or at least everything you do that's important.

417
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:19,521
I'm not sure you have to buy your groceries under the description lover of Beatrice.

418
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:25,361
But everything you do that matters manifests your defining commitment.

419
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,001
It shines through everything you do.

420
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,521
That's what it is to say that you're grounded transparently in it.

421
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,161
Dante's grounded transparently in Beatrice.

422
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:40,721
Martin Luther King is grounded transparently in the, was it a movement?

423
00:41:40,721 --> 00:41:42,000
What was it called?

424
00:41:43,281 --> 00:41:44,800
The civil rights movement.

425
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,360
Right.

426
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,800
Yes, exactly.

427
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:57,521
And so there, and now, what I think is amazing, but it only dawned on me, I think, last year, is look at power there.

428
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,361
It's lower case.

429
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,520
That's how abstract he wants to be.

430
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:11,921
I mean, it isn't going to be necessarily the God-man with a capital P power, or certainly not God, the Father, the Supreme Being with a capital P.

431
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,520
It could be Beatrice.

432
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,040
Could be a dog.

433
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:18,641
Did I tell you about that?

434
00:42:18,641 --> 00:42:20,880
I think maybe it's the time to tell you.

435
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,921
I didn't mention that.

436
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:32,881
There actually, a fellow graduate student of mine long ago named Alice Kohler wrote a book that became very famous bestseller in the 70s called An Unknown Woman.

437
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:40,800
And it's really about her and how she found herself and became authentic when she had been such a total mess before.

438
00:42:41,121 --> 00:42:46,400
But the part of it that I want to tell you about, which interests me a lot, only a Kierkegaardian could appreciate it.

439
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,840
And she doesn't know any Kierkegaard.

440
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,281
She was an analytic philosopher.

441
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:58,361
She, after botching every relationship, she finally goes off to Nantucket alone for the winter to sort of sort out her life.

442
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:06,521
And she finally realizes in despair that her life is just such a mess that it's never going to work, and that what she needs to do is commit suicide.

443
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:12,120
Unfortunately, she's had with her a dog to protect her alone all winter in Nantucket.

444
00:43:12,121 --> 00:43:14,520
The dog mysteriously named Logos.

445
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,400
This is all true.

446
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,561
Logos is the name for the Godman.

447
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:27,720
Anyway, the dog turns out she can't commit suicide because the dog is so important, and who will take care of the dog in lonely Nantucket if she kills herself?

448
00:43:27,721 --> 00:43:29,001
So she doesn't.

449
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,080
She comes back and writes a book about the whole thing, and that wouldn't be enough.

450
00:43:33,081 --> 00:43:39,481
But she becomes an animal rights person, she becomes a vegetarian, she becomes an anti-vivisectionist.

451
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:44,041
Everything in her life that she's committed to now turns around this dog.

452
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:49,081
And then she wrote a second book, which didn't work so well about the death of the dog.

453
00:43:52,121 --> 00:43:54,840
I don't know whether she became a knight of resignation or not.

454
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:06,761
She devoted her life to suing the veterinarian for malpractice, which shows, I think, that she never became quite sane, which I've always suspected.

455
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:22,201
But it is an amazing Kierkegaardian example of the fact that there's this power and there's this another, and there it gets her together.

456
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,761
And so, where was I?

457
00:44:24,761 --> 00:44:26,840
Okay, yes, and power is lowercase.

458
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:31,721
It's got to cover everything from the God-man to Logos the dog.

459
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:38,081
And it's because Kierkegaard is talking about the structure that he's discovered and is presenting.

460
00:44:38,081 --> 00:44:50,400
So, now you look at the picture and you see everything I've just been saying, the factors, the fact that you see now why R1 is just being a human being.

461
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,601
It doesn't have a relation to itself, so it's not spirit.

462
00:44:53,601 --> 00:44:58,881
You see that R2 is spirit, all right, because it's trying to get its act together, but it's in despair.

463
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:10,081
And you see that R3 is spirit happy in bliss and anguish, having transparently related to the power that posited it.

464
00:45:10,081 --> 00:45:13,521
And that's all I need to say about that.

465
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:19,281
I put on this page, and I just want to call your attention to it, also from sickness unto death.

466
00:45:19,281 --> 00:45:24,961
You may want to know, well, if power is a small P, could power also be God?

467
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,641
And the answer is no.

468
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:33,680
It can be the God-man, but Kierkegaard hasn't any place in his story for the Supreme Being, remember?

469
00:45:33,681 --> 00:45:39,761
But I just wanted you to see that he says this in this book, which according to him is the real truth.

470
00:45:39,761 --> 00:45:44,401
He says, God is that all things are possible, and that all things are possible is God.

471
00:45:44,400 --> 00:46:02,800
That means God sort of stands outside this diagram and makes it possible if you have faith in him, which isn't even a hymn, if you have faith that all things are possible, you are able to make a defining commitment and stick in it without resignation or backing out of it.

472
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,521
So, God is playing a fundamental role making this whole thing happen.

473
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:18,401
But God is the field of faith, a faith that makes you able to, remember this is my slogan, you can do things you can't understand.

474
00:46:19,721 --> 00:46:33,320
And God is that which makes it possible for you to do things you can't understand, and that's what you have to do to be able to do this necessary but contradictory thing.

475
00:46:33,641 --> 00:46:41,960
Now I'm going to stop and see if you've got anything to say about that, because you can see now, I hope, how lots of things come together, though there's still two missing pieces.

476
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,600
But I will try to add in a bit.

477
00:46:44,761 --> 00:46:47,161
Does anybody want to say anything about this?

478
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,521
I take it you're all blown away with how clear it is.

479
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,920
Totally elegant and condensed.

480
00:46:53,081 --> 00:46:54,281
You wish you wrote it.

481
00:46:54,281 --> 00:46:57,400
Okay, well, let's go on then.

482
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:05,800
The next thing is to talk about is how the factors reinforce each other in a defining relation.

483
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,481
I mean, I haven't told you.

484
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:18,441
Somebody could have been a good straight person if you had raised your hand and said, yeah, but how does the unconditional commitment get together the contradictory factors?

485
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,000
That's obviously the next question to ask.

486
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:26,041
And of course, the answer is all over the place in fear and trembling.

487
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:30,201
And all we have to do is pull the answer out of there.

488
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:34,681
How do you get the factors together when you've got an unconditional commitment?

489
00:47:34,681 --> 00:47:41,800
Well, you see how each factor gets defined so as to support the other one.

490
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,840
And that's, but now, how do you do that?

491
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:52,201
Well, the easy one is time and eternity, the temporal and the eternal.

492
00:47:52,201 --> 00:47:56,441
That I take it you already understand pretty well.

493
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:21,200
That the whole story, that the temporal is just a series of moments going along and can be constantly reinterpreted, but there's an instant, and in that instant you get your identity forever, and your past was leading up to it all along, and that's eternity and time.

494
00:48:21,201 --> 00:48:23,281
That's the forever part.

495
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,881
And this is the temporal part.

496
00:48:32,721 --> 00:48:44,721
So when Kierkegaard says eternity is only possible in time, remember I read you that, or I didn't, that isn't quite accurately what he said.

497
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:48,481
He says, only in time do I become eternal, same thing.

498
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,241
Only in time do I become eternal.

499
00:48:50,241 --> 00:48:56,640
That is, only in time can I have an instant which then gives me an experience of the forever in my life.

500
00:48:56,641 --> 00:48:59,920
You'll see that he doesn't ever say the fore say forever.

501
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,761
He always says the eternal.

502
00:49:01,761 --> 00:49:04,320
The person who says forever is Dostoevsky.

503
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:10,720
In the brothers, you'll hear lots and lots about the forever, particularly by the end of the book.

504
00:49:10,721 --> 00:49:15,281
And that's Dostoevsky's name for the eternal.

505
00:49:15,601 --> 00:49:31,040
So I get the factors together, but only if I define them, not by contemplating them, because if you try to contemplate them, I'll tell you that, just so you can see.

506
00:49:31,041 --> 00:49:36,721
If you're Greek, see, well, this is very important to realize that the factors are very abstract.

507
00:49:36,721 --> 00:49:44,800
And how you relate yourself to yourself determines how you understand the factors.

508
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,281
And that determines whether they can be put together or not, or whether they're contradictory.

509
00:49:49,960 --> 00:50:21,320
So if you're Greek and think that contemplating is the ultimate, Plato and Aristotle in one of his more philosophical frames of mind, then you think that the finite is particular things, oh sorry, the temporal is the day by day, and the eternal is something outside of time, like mathematical relations, definitions, whatever, and then you can't get them together.

510
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:36,601
There's no way to get together the part of you that contemplates mathematics and writes programs and so forth with the part of you that lives day to day in relation to particular events one after another.

511
00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:46,041
So that if you take this contemplative stance of the way to relate yourself to yourself, you won't be able to get the two together.

512
00:50:46,041 --> 00:51:03,881
But if you take an involved stance, this is the existentialist point coming around, then you can have total involvement in an unconditional commitment, and that does enable you to get what looked like a contradiction together.

513
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:12,761
Of course, you could only do it because even contradictions are possible thanks to the that all things are possible.

514
00:51:12,761 --> 00:51:18,681
And you can only do it because I have a second thing I wanted to say.

515
00:51:24,041 --> 00:51:34,281
Well, because you understand that somehow involvement is more important than detachment, which is the basic existentialist argument against the whole philosophical tradition.

516
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,360
But that wasn't what I was going to say.

517
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:41,840
I was going to say, you can do it because even the impossible is possible.

518
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,240
And you're always in anguish when you do it.

519
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,361
You're alive to the tension.

520
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:51,920
You're realizing that you can do it, but you can't understand it.

521
00:51:52,241 --> 00:51:53,761
But you can do it.

522
00:51:53,761 --> 00:52:02,001
And that's now you can and it's a defining commitment that got you together, got the factors of temporal and eternal together.

523
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,600
Now, the next one is h much harder.

524
00:52:06,161 --> 00:52:08,241
If you don't understand it, that's all right.

525
00:52:08,241 --> 00:52:11,840
But how do you get the finite and infinite together?

526
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:22,561
Well, so far we've really said that if you get an identity, that's the first one, you get the temporal and eternal together, because you're forever the lover of Mary or whatever.

527
00:52:23,281 --> 00:52:27,840
The lad loves the princess or Dante loves Beatrice forever.

528
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,361
They get their identity.

529
00:52:29,681 --> 00:52:33,521
The infinite and the finite have to do with getting a world.

530
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,600
And that's harder to understand.

531
00:52:36,241 --> 00:52:39,921
Finite describes things in the world.

532
00:52:40,561 --> 00:52:47,520
And what infinite describes, and this is something I don't know where Kierkegaard says it, but he should say it.

533
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,441
I'm pretty sure it's what he means.

534
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,601
Why does he talk about the infinite when you get a defining commitment?

535
00:52:53,601 --> 00:52:58,161
I've said this, but every once in a while, and I'm sure it doesn't really register.

536
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:12,641
When you get a defining commitment, it isn't just that everything that you come across that's important to you gets its importance from your relation to, say, Mary or the princess or whatever.

537
00:53:12,641 --> 00:53:24,361
But you know that anything that ever could have importance for you, anything that could, so to speak, come into your world, come into your life, will be understood in terms of this relationship.

538
00:53:24,681 --> 00:53:38,041
So you know something about the infinite, namely that that is not just all the particular finite things that happen to be around, but every possible finite thing that could ever be.

539
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:46,121
Indefinitely many are already defined in terms of their importance, get their importance by this relation.

540
00:53:46,121 --> 00:53:53,001
That's a very complicated way to say that when you've got this relation, it defines, so to speak, the limits of your world.

541
00:53:53,641 --> 00:53:55,881
And that's the infinite part of it.

542
00:53:56,201 --> 00:54:03,320
So now you then that's how what satisfies your need for the finite and for the infinite.

543
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:08,840
Or if you like a slogan that does that sort of says it, but in a way that doesn't explain it.

544
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:17,241
If you have an infinite passion, infinite passion, for something finite, you get the infinite and the finite together.

545
00:54:17,241 --> 00:54:19,560
I'm only trying to tell you what an infinite passion is.

546
00:54:19,561 --> 00:54:23,161
It isn't sort of getting all hot and sweaty and panting or anything.

547
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,641
It's what defines the limits of your world.

548
00:54:27,641 --> 00:54:35,401
If you have a passion that defines everything that comes into your world, you can only have that for something specific in your world.

549
00:54:35,721 --> 00:54:37,561
The person you love, for instance.

550
00:54:37,561 --> 00:54:40,040
So that you get the finite and infinite together.

551
00:54:40,041 --> 00:54:41,881
That's pretty amazing.

552
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,080
And Fairfield Gaard is surely thinking that.

553
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:51,721
I wish I could quote you a quote where he says it, but I except for the phrase infinite passion, I can't really tell you.

554
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:58,681
But Ada Slov my slogan is: an infinite passion for something finite gives you a world.

555
00:54:58,681 --> 00:55:01,401
Gives you your world, I should say.

556
00:55:02,681 --> 00:55:04,561
Everybody has to have their own.

557
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,441
It's like everybody has to have their own identity.

558
00:55:04,121 --> 00:55:07,600
Okay.

559
00:55:09,201 --> 00:55:12,081
Now, the last one is easy again.

560
00:55:12,081 --> 00:55:16,001
And that is facticity and freedom.

561
00:55:16,241 --> 00:55:19,761
Facticity is my word, Heidegger's word for this.

562
00:55:21,761 --> 00:55:24,480
Essity and possibility.

563
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:29,761
Heidegger's got facticity and freedom, which I think is easier to understand.

564
00:55:29,761 --> 00:55:37,201
But what the issue is, is that once you get this identity and get this world, let's stick to the identity.

565
00:55:37,201 --> 00:55:39,201
That's the main one we talk about.

566
00:55:39,201 --> 00:55:42,641
An identity is like a definition.

567
00:55:42,641 --> 00:55:44,080
It's necessary.

568
00:55:44,081 --> 00:55:47,440
I mean, it's necessary that 2 plus 2 equals 4.

569
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,281
It just isn't an accident, or that a triangle has 180 degrees.

570
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:54,320
It's eternally true, but that's not what I want to stress now.

571
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:59,520
I want to stress now it's not up for grabs, and in a certain sense, you can't change it.

572
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:15,121
And since this is your defining commitment, it defines who you are in the way that the 180 degrees with a three-sided closed figure defines a triangle, and it has to have 180 degrees.

573
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:23,440
There's something very fixed and necessary in the defining part of a defining relation.

574
00:56:23,761 --> 00:56:46,241
But of course, it's not defining the way numbers are or definitions of in or normal definitions are, because you're still free, even though you're defined and necessarily fixed, you know, and that's the necessary part, with your identity.

575
00:56:46,241 --> 00:56:51,081
You are still free in lots of ways to deal with that identity.

576
00:56:51,081 --> 00:56:52,281
We've seen them.

577
00:56:48,800 --> 00:57:04,681
For instance, the crucial one, you are free to live in it with the sword hanging over the head of the beloved, or you're free to make the movement of resignation and make it safe.

578
00:57:04,681 --> 00:57:09,320
Of course, you're free to do it, but you'll be in despair, but you can do it.

579
00:57:09,641 --> 00:57:13,481
I made a list of all the things you're still free to do.

580
00:57:15,721 --> 00:57:18,041
What's possible for you?

581
00:57:18,041 --> 00:57:24,601
Well, you can, where do I have my list?

582
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,921
Oh, you could become an I resignation.

583
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:32,761
You could forget the whole thing, go back to lower immediacy.

584
00:57:32,761 --> 00:57:36,360
Remember, that's like the guy at the end of 1984.

585
00:57:36,761 --> 00:57:38,361
Or maybe that's not like that.

586
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,761
He betrays the woman he loves.

587
00:57:40,761 --> 00:57:41,961
You can do that too.

588
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:56,760
Maybe that's, according to Han in the third man, if we assume that Holly has got a kind of defining relation for Harry as his best friend, and who he sort of thinks of himself as Harry's friend, we can push this a little.

589
00:57:57,081 --> 00:58:00,041
And it's Harry that makes the world interesting.

590
00:58:00,041 --> 00:58:10,121
Holly will drop everything to go to when Harry calls and will do anything to help him and so forth.

591
00:58:10,121 --> 00:58:20,281
Well, in the end, Holly, who's got freedom, who's got possibility, betrays Harry because he thinks the ethical is higher.

592
00:58:20,681 --> 00:58:28,601
So you've got freedom to betray the commitment, and you've even got freedom, and this is a hard one, of course, to change it.

593
00:58:28,601 --> 00:58:54,081
That is, to change its status so that you go through grief and you change the commitment to this person was the most important person in my life, is still defining me, but defining me in a way that he's become part of me or she's become part of me such that I'm open to another person who will sort of add to the definition of me.

594
00:58:54,081 --> 00:58:55,680
That's all your possibility.

595
00:58:55,681 --> 00:58:56,961
That's your freedom.

596
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:03,681
All of this in the realm of this defining limit that's fixed about you once you've got an unconditional commitment.

597
00:59:03,681 --> 00:59:04,960
So that's the third one.

598
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,921
That's how you get that together.

599
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:14,721
Now, let me read, because I sort of made that up without reading what I'm saying, and it may have done something wrong.

600
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:38,881
So another way to talk about possibility is that even though the central concern in my life is fixed for good, I'm free to relate to myself and relate to it in all sorts of ways.

601
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,281
Then I was telling you the way.

602
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:48,481
And that's another way to remember to say it's not a compulsion that this kind of commitment.

603
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,561
There's lots of freedom in it.

604
00:59:50,561 --> 00:59:58,800
You've got to be able to free to give it up, even though if you do, you'll be in despair.

605
01:00:00,641 --> 01:00:01,281
Okay.

606
01:00:01,601 --> 01:00:04,961
So now I finished the story of this piece of it.

607
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,160
That is, now we understand not just that.

608
01:00:08,161 --> 01:00:26,520
The self is out of despair if and only if it relates to itself by relating to another and expresses transparently in what it does, that this other is the power that constituted it, that whole mouthful.

609
01:00:26,761 --> 01:00:31,401
We've seen that if you do that, you can get the factors together.

610
01:00:31,721 --> 01:00:38,601
But doing it requires doing having anguish and doing something which if you were rational, you wouldn't do.

611
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,721
But we're not going to go back over that to be clear from fear and trembling.

612
01:00:43,721 --> 01:00:47,640
Okay, now maybe somebody wants to say something.

613
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:48,680
Do they?

614
01:00:48,681 --> 01:00:49,641
Anybody?

615
01:00:49,641 --> 01:00:50,200
Yeah.

616
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,640
That's the MIT formula, as I call it.

617
01:00:57,641 --> 01:00:58,201
Remember?

618
01:00:58,601 --> 01:01:02,281
I have to keep writing that around because that's sort of hard to get used to.

619
01:01:02,281 --> 01:01:07,961
But we've got X defining commitment to Y.

620
01:01:08,281 --> 01:01:10,201
Then you can go and do it.

621
01:01:10,201 --> 01:01:15,641
You can do resignation, which is X defining commitment to the idea of Y.

622
01:01:15,641 --> 01:01:31,320
But you can also do this paradoxical thing of going through grief, which is paradoxical already, because in grief you both think that you'll always have a defining commitment and that you could never have again because this is who you are and you just lost the thing that's most defining of who you are.

623
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:37,000
You take Y over, you interiorize Y, and you're open to Z.

624
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,160
That's the story.

625
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:45,320
Now, Kierkegaard, and you're right to question it always, because Kierkegaard has no clue about that.

626
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,320
He just doesn't understand grief.

627
01:01:47,320 --> 01:02:02,281
And all he remember, I'm building this whole story on one phrase in Kierkegaard, namely that Abraham believed in the absurd, in the paradoxical, and he had faith, and he knew that he could get a new Isaac.

628
01:02:02,281 --> 01:02:03,960
And you say, well, how can he get a new Isaac?

629
01:02:04,081 --> 01:02:05,281
This is the defining one.

630
01:02:05,281 --> 01:02:06,080
This is the only one.

631
01:02:06,081 --> 01:02:16,721
Are you going to just drop Isaac and say, well, let's just go off with who's Isaac's brother that gets sent off because he's not really Sarah's son?

632
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:20,560
Ishmael.

633
01:02:20,561 --> 01:02:21,360
Is that what somebody said?

634
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,721
It's Ishmael, I believe.

635
01:02:22,721 --> 01:02:25,761
So Abraham could say, well, I'll just adopt Ishmael.

636
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,800
After all, he's really my natural child and so forth.

637
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,121
That's not what it is to get a new Isaac.

638
01:02:31,121 --> 01:02:42,001
And to get a new Isaac is a paradoxical something, Kierkegaard knows, but he doesn't know what sort of suffering and anguish makes it possible, though he sort of knows it's some kind of suffering.

639
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,361
And remember, Isaac is also the ethical, just to review.

640
01:02:45,360 --> 01:03:00,961
And somehow, even though you're doing this loathsome, impossible thing, and you're in anguish, you somehow do it with the sense that even though you couldn't make any sense of how, you will always have the ethical on your side.

641
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,680
And again, Kierkegaard has no story about that.

642
01:03:03,681 --> 01:03:10,320
He knows that there's lots of anguish and suffering and that it's experienced as impossible and that you can do it, but you can't understand it.

643
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:13,360
And I'm putting in the phenomenon.

644
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:14,961
At least I believe I am.

645
01:03:15,281 --> 01:03:18,721
And I don't have a good sense of how suffering changes the ethical.

646
01:03:18,721 --> 01:03:21,121
I just know it better do that.

647
01:03:21,681 --> 01:03:30,960
And yeah, I mean, I don't know any play or book or anything else that does have a sense of it, though I'm sure there must be.

648
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,761
If anybody knows, come and tell me.

649
01:03:34,081 --> 01:03:35,520
Did I see a hand up over here?

650
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:35,920
Yeah.

651
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,040
I might have to give it.

652
01:03:45,761 --> 01:03:52,601
I want to say that's what you're free to do, and you never need to do it, but you're free to do it, and that's your freedom.

653
01:03:49,121 --> 01:03:54,040
And I see what you're asking.

654
01:03:54,281 --> 01:03:56,360
How are you normally expressing your freedom?

655
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:56,920
Oh, you're good.

656
01:03:57,081 --> 01:03:58,201
Very good question.

657
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:03,480
Because you might say to me, well, yeah, but you've got to be, remember, you've got to, that's terrific.

658
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,081
I think I know what you're thinking.

659
01:04:05,081 --> 01:04:09,880
You've got to be able to fully be expressing both sets of factors all the time.

660
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,001
That's what you're thinking.

661
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:19,401
And I've told you how you can express the finite and infinite all the time, and the temporal and eternal all the time, but I've sort of told you the necessary is there all the time.

662
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,800
And sometimes you can do this possible thing.

663
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:22,920
And that's not enough.

664
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:25,800
You ought to be in the possible all the time.

665
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:26,521
Good.

666
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:27,800
I think you are.

667
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:40,921
I think what the answer is something like: all the time, you are free to give this relation whatever expression it seems to require in that situation that comes along.

668
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:45,800
And that's going to turn out to be lots of different ways of having to decide.

669
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:58,840
Like, I could see if my vocation is teaching, then I'm free constantly and have to decide whether to stay and talk to students into the night or to go home and see my wife and children.

670
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:00,601
It's a big problem.

671
01:05:00,601 --> 01:05:03,641
And I'm free to do it.

672
01:05:03,641 --> 01:05:08,920
And that's the kind of freedom that from day to day you have to have.

673
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,080
Oh, anything else?

674
01:05:11,081 --> 01:05:13,880
You see, the good questions come out if you just wait.

675
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:14,281
Yeah.

676
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:25,560
You can't.

677
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:26,520
That's good.

678
01:05:26,841 --> 01:05:33,241
I mean, that's, I have to keep saying this over and over because Kierkegaard is such a peculiar Christian.

679
01:05:33,241 --> 01:05:35,600
You can't have an increase in passion for God.

680
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,840
That's what you're discovering, and that's great.

681
01:05:37,841 --> 01:05:48,640
Because God would be infinite and eternal and so forth, and it wouldn't do for expressing the finite and temporal side of your life.

682
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:57,440
That's why love of God, remember, he says in fear and trembling that he's in despair, that is DeSilentio, who's a knight of resignation.

683
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:06,960
And he says, love of God is my favorite thing, and it makes me blissful, and I can do it all the time, and it doesn't keep him out of despair at all.

684
01:06:06,961 --> 01:06:20,081
So, love of God, it turns out to be a good thing, spiritual, a step in the right direction, but it is not the con, that's not another.

685
01:06:20,081 --> 01:06:22,480
God isn't another, God isn't a supreme being.

686
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,680
Let's turn it the other way.

687
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:27,440
If God is that all things are possible, you can't love that.

688
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:30,161
That's just a kind of atmosphere or something.

689
01:06:30,161 --> 01:06:35,121
So, there's no way to love the God that Kierkegaard is talking about.

690
01:06:35,121 --> 01:06:40,800
But, and this is very important, God did become man, and you can love the God-man.

691
01:06:40,801 --> 01:06:48,640
Kierkegaard is very clear about distinguishing Jesus as the God-man from God the Supreme Being.

692
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:59,520
And he says, I keep repeating this: once God has become man, then you can't have any relation to God anymore except by relating to the God-man.

693
01:06:59,841 --> 01:07:02,081
Kierkegaard is an extreme Protestant.

694
01:07:02,081 --> 01:07:08,560
I mean, this is sort of the logic of Protestantism carried out to the farthest.

695
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:18,320
And you'll see Dostoevsky, who's a total genius, invents Kierkegaard and pushes this to its absolute extreme in the brothers.

696
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:20,440
But, anyways, is that help?

697
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:22,040
Okay, next.

698
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:30,600
Okay, well, I'm ready to go on, but at least to pose a problem.

699
01:07:31,161 --> 01:07:33,081
I don't think I have time to answer it today.

700
01:07:33,161 --> 01:07:33,640
That's fine.

701
01:07:34,201 --> 01:07:36,840
Good thing for you to think about till Thursday.

702
01:07:37,161 --> 01:07:48,281
So Kierkegaard says that anybody who's not managed to get the self together by an unconditional commitment to another is in despair.

703
01:07:48,841 --> 01:07:57,720
If you're reading this as just a philosopher contemplating the book and thinking about it, this shouldn't make a big difference to you.

704
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:08,281
But if you're trying to take this book seriously as a kind of existential statement that's supposed to speak directly to your life, then that must be rather upsetting.

705
01:08:08,281 --> 01:08:16,920
Because anyone here who hasn't got an unconditional commitment, and I suspect there's most of us, must be in despair.

706
01:08:16,921 --> 01:08:19,001
And that, are you going to buy that?

707
01:08:19,001 --> 01:08:26,840
Are you going to let Kierkegaard tell you, all through here, 200 people, that you're all in despair and that he knows it, even though he hasn't ever met any of you?

708
01:08:26,841 --> 01:08:29,480
This is outrageous, it seems to me.

709
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:44,040
And you want to say, this is, and each one of them wants to say in their own terms, unless they've actually gone through despair and got out of it by having an unconditional commitment, that they are, you see, you could be in the unconscious kind of despair.

710
01:08:44,041 --> 01:08:52,600
I think children are in it, but also game players who can go on for until they're old, still in it.

711
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,800
And so, but so what do you want to say?

712
01:08:55,801 --> 01:08:58,440
You want to say, this is ridiculous, Kierkegaard.

713
01:08:58,440 --> 01:08:59,800
I'm not in despair.

714
01:09:00,201 --> 01:09:01,840
I'm a happy pagan.

715
01:09:01,841 --> 01:09:09,201
Or I'm a robot maker like what's the guy whose name I keep forgetting who wrote Mine Children.

716
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:18,241
Moravec, who says, Well, I'm as long as I can write programs and I don't care what happens to my body, but I'm happy.

717
01:09:18,241 --> 01:09:20,080
He's a platonist.

718
01:09:20,881 --> 01:09:25,041
Or you may think you're satisfying some sense of the finite and infinite.

719
01:09:25,281 --> 01:09:29,600
At least you're fulfilling all your capacities and everything is working for you.

720
01:09:31,201 --> 01:09:35,201
So if you think that, how in the world is Kierkegaard going to convince you?

721
01:09:35,201 --> 01:09:40,480
Well, you think you're having a great time, that you're in fact in despair right now.

722
01:09:41,281 --> 01:09:43,920
Why does he have a right to say that to you?

723
01:09:43,921 --> 01:09:46,400
You shouldn't let him get away with it.

724
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:51,360
Well, this gets you onto page two of the handout.

725
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:55,121
And I'll read it, but I won't try to tell you what it means.

726
01:09:55,121 --> 01:09:56,400
You think about it.

727
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:07,040
He says, the common view overlooks the fact that when compared with illness, despair differs dialectically from what one usually calls sickness, because it is sickness of the spirit.

728
01:10:07,041 --> 01:10:12,960
And this dialectic aspect, properly understood, brings further thousands under the category of despair.

729
01:10:12,961 --> 01:10:14,400
Millions, really.

730
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,920
And this whole room, presumably.

731
01:10:17,921 --> 01:10:30,960
If at any time a physician is convinced that so-and-so is in good health, and then later that person becomes ill, then the physician may well be right about his having been well at the time, but now being sick.

732
01:10:30,961 --> 01:10:33,040
Not so with despair.

733
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:37,760
Once despair appears, what is apparent is that the person was in despair.

734
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:44,960
In fact, it's never possible at any time to decide anything about a person who's not saved through having been in despair.

735
01:10:44,961 --> 01:10:45,281
What?

736
01:10:45,281 --> 01:10:46,161
Is that the end of this?

737
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,800
In fact, it's never possible to decide anything.

738
01:10:48,921 --> 01:10:50,201
I guess you have to answer that.

739
01:10:50,201 --> 01:10:54,360
To decide anything about a person who's not saved through having been in despair.

740
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:56,360
That means you just can't tell.

741
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:03,800
Don't worry about that sentence.

742
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:05,161
I don't like that sentence.

743

I think I could make up a story that would make it all right, but it would be more trouble than it was worth.

744
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:16,520
For when whatever causes a person to despair occurs, it is immediately evident that he's been in despair his whole life.

745
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:23,560

01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:31,720
But despair is a characteristic of the spirit, is related to the eternal, and therefore has something of the eternal in its dialectic.

01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:35,080
Are you anybody here now convinced that they're in despair?

748
01:11:35,081 --> 01:11:37,800
Having heard this amazing passage?

749
01:11:37,801 --> 01:11:45,560
Okay, well, it's too late to try to convince you right now, but I'll think about it, read it again, decide if it convinces you in despair.

We'll talk about it more next time.
