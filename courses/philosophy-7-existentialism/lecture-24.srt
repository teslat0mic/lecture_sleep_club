00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,641
So I want to go back a little because I said something which it took me a long time to figure out and somebody encouraged me to repeat it by saying after class that it was interesting.

2
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:18,881
And I think it is interesting to ask yourself why Yvonne, remember, Yvonne has picked up the peasant.

3
00:00:18,881 --> 00:00:22,320
He's decided that he's going to go confess right away.

4
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:27,680
He's feeling joy for the first time I think you ever hear that Yvonne's feeling joy.

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,921
And he's also sort of embracing another human being.

6
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:36,001
I think it's the first time, I said it was the first time he ever touched another human being.

7
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:37,280
That's not quite right.

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,481
Somebody pointed out to me, Alyasha kissed him at the end of the Grand Inquisitor story, but that's different.

9
00:00:42,761 --> 00:00:44,521
He was touched by another human being.

10
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:48,521
That he should actually, so to speak, be carrying this peasant in his arms.

11
00:00:48,521 --> 00:00:50,600
That's new for Ivan.

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:01:05,241
And it would be wonderful if he's now able to become, to accept his involvement in the world and accept the fact that he's got a concern for other people.

13
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:06,840
And he thinks he's going to do that.

14
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,481
And he thinks that he's going to go right away to the police and confess because that's...

15
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:11,961
Uh-oh.

16
00:01:11,961 --> 00:01:14,121
This is not going to get any better.

17
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,521
Where does the noise come from?

18
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,121
I don't know.

19
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:24,920
Okay, so now he says that the middle, this is where we were, on 598.

20
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:37,560
He's made his resolution to turn himself in because he now thinks that he's responsible for the murder of Ol Karamatsov.

21
00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:41,001
And then he doesn't do it at the bottom of 598.

22
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:47,800
Just as he reached his own house, he stopped, asking him suddenly whether he'd better go or not tell, whether he should go right away.

23
00:01:47,801 --> 00:01:54,761
And he says, everything together tomorrow, he whispered to himself at the top of 599.

24
00:01:55,081 --> 00:02:00,360
And strange to say, almost all his gladness and self-satisfaction passed in an instant.

25
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,840
Now that's pretty mysterious when as soon as he goes into his room, he's going to see the devil.

26
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:21,001
But before we can get to that, which is where we were just about last time, what why was it that when he saw said everything together tomorrow, he lost his joy and, well, period.

27
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:29,521
Well, the first thing to say is what he obviously lost was his conviction to go do it, because he didn't do it tomorrow.

28
00:02:27,641 --> 00:02:32,241
And why did he have to lose it?

29
00:02:27,801 --> 00:02:33,841
Well, that's the part that's interesting.

30
00:02:34,160 --> 00:03:12,881
Dostoevsky thinks that, given that people are selfish and trying to protect themselves from pain and suffering and so forth, nobody is going to just rationally turn themselves in for a murder, say, that nobody knows they committed, or do any of the other sort of things that you do when you're in this other world, so to speak, the other world where you feel your connectedness to other people and where you understand that if you do anything wrong, you have to confess it to the people you've done it to so you could be back in some intimate relation with them.

31
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:18,400
You only have that understanding when you are acting impulsively.

32
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:31,040
Because as soon as you act philosophically, that is, stop and reflect, then this selfish or self-protecting side wins out in the argument.

33
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,001
Don't do it.

34
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:35,600
Nobody knows and it's not going to hurt you.

35
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,521
I mean, it's not going to hurt not to tell them, and it's going to hurt you to tell them.

36
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:48,641
So, as soon as he decides not to confess impulsively, which he had decided all of a sudden on the previous page, he's lost it.

37
00:03:48,801 --> 00:03:52,400
He's never going to confess at all from Dostoevsky's point of view.

38
00:03:52,400 --> 00:04:04,641
So, I wrote here: to accept this kind of responsibility that you have to accept, because that's how the world is really put together, everybody responsible for everybody, you have to do it spontaneously.

39
00:04:04,641 --> 00:04:08,720
As soon as you reflect, your selfish nature takes over.

40
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:17,321
And remember that the mysterious visitor confesses because he sees Zostima impulsively throw away his gun at the duel.

41
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:22,681
And then the mysterious visitor impulsively runs in and confesses to Zosima.

42
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:36,920
That you can only, and the final one, which ties up with where we were last time, is Dimitri's big experience that he has to go and suffer in some way to show everybody the right way to suffer.

43
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,121
That's also done impulsively.

44
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:51,721
And in fact, there is something, the very nature of the paramatsovs, one of their sort of redeeming features is that they're impulsive.

45
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,440
And since they're impulsive, every once in a while they do something really good.

46
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:16,360
So at the bottom of 484, this is about Dimitri, but it's, you'll see, it generalizes the story about how, if you're impulsive, you do sometimes good things, which if you're reflective and detached and rational and philosophical, you wouldn't do.

47
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:22,121
This is about a fourth of the way from the bottom of 484.

48
00:05:22,761 --> 00:05:24,121
It's about Dimitri now.

49
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,641
And he felt that a passion of pity, such as he had never known before, was rising in his heart.

50
00:05:29,641 --> 00:05:41,081
That he wanted to cry, that he wanted to do something for them all, so that the babe should cry no more, so that the dark-faced, dried-up mother should not weep, that no one should shed tears again.

51
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:49,161
From that moment, he wanted to do all this at once, at once, reckless of obstacles, with the recklessness of the Karamatsov.

52
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:57,240
So that's the, the Karamatsovs have the impulsiveness that drives them sometimes to do really good things.

53
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:17,041
Of course, if you're an angel like Alyasha, you're always spontaneously doing good things, but that's because he's already been touched by Zosima, who's been touched by Markle, and he's already had his religious experience in the middle of the book in which he's in touch with the love that streams around from all, in all connectedness.

54
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:21,201
And so Alyasha doesn't ever reflect.

55
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:23,121
He doesn't ever have to reflect.

56
00:06:23,681 --> 00:06:28,321
And he never doubts his spontaneous responses.

57
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:46,161
Okay, now comes this funny and interesting part where, as soon as Yvonne decides that he's not going to confess, or that he's going to confess the next day, which we know now that I've explained it, I hope, that he means he's not going to confess, because once he thinks it over, he's not going to do it.

58
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:51,121
Then he comes into the house, his house, and feels this cold.

59
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,441
Now we're going to look carefully for a while from 6:12 on, where Yvonne confronts the devil.

60
00:06:57,441 --> 00:07:00,880
And this is not, I think I should say this now, I have to say it sometime.

61
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,121
Look at that, I didn't get the lights on back then.

62
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,000
But anybody who wants to, let's have some lights.

63
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,840
Not much.

64
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:25,840
Anyway, so he confronts the devil, which is not a demythologized, that is an existentialized devil.

65
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,881
That's Rakitin.

66
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:37,521
I mean, Rakitin is an example in real human terms of the kind of vanity and the desire to see the fall of the people who are better than you are that is devilish.

67
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,281
This is a different thing.

68
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:55,801
This is a psychological story in which the devil plays a certain role in Yvonne's psychic constitution, which tells you something about what it is to be Yvonne and something about what it is to be a human self.

69
00:07:55,801 --> 00:08:00,281
So now we're going to find out on 6:12, starting.

70
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,201
Where?

71
00:08:04,201 --> 00:08:05,081
Why?

72
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,600
Ah, it's more about the impulsiveness.

73
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,041
I forgot this passage.

74
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:19,961
Yvonne's devil, of course, and we'll hear more about it, but you know already, is really Yvonne talking to himself.

75
00:08:19,961 --> 00:08:21,401
It's a hallucination.

76
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,561
He even knows it's a hallucination.

77
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,681
It's his dark side externalized and talking to him.

78
00:08:28,681 --> 00:08:37,161
And so the devil tells him the same thing about impulsiveness that I've been telling you about 12 lines down on 6:12.

79
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:43,721
The devil says, and I swear to you by all the sacred, I long to join the choir and shout Hosanna with them all.

80
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,801
The word had almost escaped me, had almost broken from my lips.

81
00:08:47,801 --> 00:09:03,241
You know how susceptible and impressionable I am, but common sense, that's like this rational reflection, but common sense, oh, a most unhappy trait in my character kept me in bounds, and I let the moment pass.

82
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,921
See, that's exactly the same, that's just the transition to getting the devil.

83
00:09:07,161 --> 00:09:16,840
Yvonne let the moment pass, the moment in which he was not being sensible, but being emotional and impulsive.

84
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:24,521
And when he does that, he comes back to his room, and there's something cold waiting for him in his room.

85
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,360
Why 599?

86
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,441
Oh, that's where it starts.

87
00:09:27,081 --> 00:09:30,961
599 starts the devil story.

88
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:38,961
And at the end of the top paragraph, he knew that he was not well, but he loathed the thought of being ill at that critical time and so forth.

89
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:40,081
Never mind, I don't know why.

90
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:41,360
I don't need that right now.

91
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,521
What I want to talk about right now is why it's cold.

92
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,040
I must have thought you're the wrong quote.

93
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,561
Yeah, I mean to read the top.

94
00:09:50,561 --> 00:10:02,881
As he entered his room, he felt something like a touch of ice on his heart, like a recollection, or more exactly, a reminder of something agonizing and revolting that was in that room now at that moment and had been there before.

95
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,121
Well, there is something agonizing and revolting in the room right now.

96
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:17,281
It's Yvonne, of course, who's being arrogant and detached and selfish and self-protective and so forth, as usual.

97
00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:22,801
But this time it's Yvonne sort of confronting himself in the form of the devil.

98
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:26,241
And it's interesting that there's a touch of ice on his heart.

99
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,761
I think I may have mentioned this before, but it won't hurt to repeat it.

100
00:10:30,081 --> 00:10:36,801
That hell is coldness in Dante, not jumping around in fires.

101
00:10:36,801 --> 00:10:43,041
Jumping around in fires is a Protestant kind of hell, and I don't really know why it's that way.

102
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,321
It's somehow an active conception of evil.

103
00:10:46,321 --> 00:11:01,840
But Dante and Dostoevsky share a Catholic conception of evil as being more and more cold and detached, so that in the Divine Comedy, Dante has the worst souls.

104
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,561
I said this when we talked about the third man, I remember now.

105
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:12,401
The worst souls who betray the people they love and who love them are frozen in ice at the bottom of hell.

106
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:21,881
And the more you get unable to love and unable to be impulsive, the more you get unable to move.

107
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:35,240
So that instead of jumping all around like Satan does in Milton's Paradise Lost, which is sort of the ultimate Protestant picture of hell, Satan is frozen in ice at the bottom of hell and Dante and barely can move.

108
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:42,921
He just can clap his wings and he acts like a big refrigerator, flapping his wings, chilling all the people in hell.

109
00:11:42,921 --> 00:11:45,081
So they're all cold.

110
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:52,441
There was a cartoon in the New Yorker, I think, about a week ago, I just remember of these older people, you know, are always cold and so forth.

111
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:55,641
And these older people in hell are complaining that it's too hot.

112
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,441
And saying, why don't they raise the temperature?

113
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:00,120
You call this hot and so forth.

114
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,641
And if they're really being Dante-like, they're probably bad old people.

115
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:05,561
They're icy.

116
00:12:06,201 --> 00:12:09,641
So now let's see where we are.

117
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:16,441
So the devil, and the devil turns out to be the side of Yvonne, which is rational and European.

118
00:12:16,441 --> 00:12:19,081
He speaks French every once in a while.

119
00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:29,081
At one point, he talks about how, like Yvonne, he can't stand ugliness.

120
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,041
Where is that?

121
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,801
The top of 6-12.

122
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:42,281
He says, I am perhaps the one man in all creation who loves the truth and really desires good.

123
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,201
That's Yvonne's view of himself.

124
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:48,681
That's why he says he's going to kill himself at 30, because the world isn't good enough for him.

125
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,001
He won't make any moral compromises.

126
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,801
And living in the world is a compromise.

127
00:12:53,801 --> 00:13:11,201
So you get all these views that Yvonne has, but they're sort of extreme and parodied by the earthy, that is, latty from Yvonne's point of view, side of himself, which is what the devil expresses.

128
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:20,721
And that, what's what Yvonne can't stand in himself on 637?

129
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,920
637.

130
00:13:21,921 --> 00:13:24,081
No, I'm getting it wrong.

131
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:27,600
Christ 6:12.

132
00:13:36,161 --> 00:13:37,840
Yes, at the bottom.

133
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:49,360
Yvonne, he says, all my stupid ideas, outgrown, thrashed out long ago, and flung aside like dead carcasses, you present to me now as something new.

134
00:13:49,681 --> 00:13:59,281
So he knows that these are his own stupid, old ideas, and he knows that that's the lackey, flunky side of him, he says at the top of 6.13.

135
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,360
But he's also denying it.

136
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,121
This gets complicated in a second.

137
00:14:03,121 --> 00:14:05,441
He says, no, I was never such a flunky.

138
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:08,400
How then can my soul beget a flunky like you?

139
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:10,880
Well, that's what he's trying to figure out.

140
00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:19,120
How he can be related to this unpleasant, stupid, sort of generally obnoxious devil.

141
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:30,080
And he knows that the devil is a hallucination, but he has a very peculiar relation to the hallucination, which I'll tell you first.

142
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,681
But first, but first you have to see that he knows it on 202 in the middle.

143
00:14:33,681 --> 00:14:38,561
He says, Never for one minute have I taken you for reality, Yvonne cried with a sort of fury.

144
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,201
You're a lie.

145
00:14:39,201 --> 00:14:40,080
You're my illness.

146
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,280
You're a phantom.

147
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:51,560
And skipping a little, you are the incarnation of myself, but only one side of me, of my thoughts and feelings, not only, but only the worst, most stupid.

148
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,001
Keep in mind the self.

149
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:04,040
Keep in mind that for Yvonne there is the lofty side and the lacy side, and the lackey side is the sensual, selfish, dark side.

150
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,921
And Yvonne wants to deny that he's ever like that.

151
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:10,201
He always thinks he's the lofty person.

152
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:16,761
So now, there you see him resisting taking the devil to be real.

153
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:24,201
What's much more interesting is that he wants the devil to be real.

154
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:35,400
On page 609, this is really the crunch of Dostoevsky's analysis of what happens if you get the wrong relation of the self to the self.

155
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:41,720
About ten lines from the bottom, he says to the devil, but I would like to believe in you, he added strangely.

156
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,240
Now, this is a question for somebody here.

157
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,361
Why does Yvonne want to believe the devil is real?

158
00:15:48,361 --> 00:15:51,720
I mean, it's easy enough to see why he's resisting believing the devil is real.

159
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,400
He doesn't want to go crazy.

160
00:15:53,401 --> 00:15:56,681
But why would he wish that the devil were real?

161
00:15:58,121 --> 00:15:58,760
Yeah.

162
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:03,000
He doesn't want to believe it's him.

163
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,480
Explain that.

164
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,840
That's good.

165
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,921
Well, he won't say he's having the levels.

166
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:21,000
Well, I'm not sure I understand you.

167
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,840
Are you saying that he wants to reject the part of himself which he finds lacking-like?

168
00:16:26,841 --> 00:16:27,601
Right.

169
00:16:28,641 --> 00:16:29,600
And what?

170
00:16:27,401 --> 00:16:34,081
Well, no, no, I think that's not it.

171
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,600
He sees it in the devil, all right, his lackey side.

172
00:16:37,601 --> 00:16:42,961
But if there is a devil that has his lackey impulses, why would I even like that?

173
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:43,281
Yeah.

174
00:16:53,441 --> 00:16:54,720
It's terrific.

175
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,681
Perfectly put.

176
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,760
Instead of objectified, though a little better would be externalized, but that's what you're saying.

177
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:05,760
He's externalizing, putting outside of himself that lacky side of himself.

178
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,681
He's always been denying it.

179
00:17:07,681 --> 00:17:09,921
He's a negative R2 person, remember.

180
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:15,600
That is, he relates himself to himself by denying the dark side of himself.

181
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,000
Well, now he's got a new way of denying it.

182
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:25,201
Deny it by saying, well, the devil comes around and makes me do these slacky things, but that's because it's not me.

183
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:28,240
That's some other force that's causing me to do these lacky things.

184
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,280
That's what he wants to say.

185
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,201
So he wouldn't be responsible.

186
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:35,441
He doesn't have to take responsibility for his lacking side.

187
00:17:35,441 --> 00:17:41,120
But, of course, there's a downside to that, obviously.

188
00:17:41,121 --> 00:17:44,240
He he can only get that by going crazy.

189
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,681
And he knows that.

190
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:48,560
And this trade-off is what's worrying him.

191
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,760
You just have this funny thing at the top of 605 where this is happening.

192
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:01,201
They're talking about whether there's an axe in hell and whether people could the more sadism, by the way.

193
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:16,281
If anybody's left doubting that Yvonne is sadistic, he's worrying about the idea that maybe it's so cold in hell that people who put their tongue on an axe will have their skin on their, will freeze their tongue immediately to the axe, and their skin will, the other tongue will come off.

194
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:18,121
That's what he's now interested in.

195
00:18:18,921 --> 00:18:23,560
A pretty weird thing to be discussing for him.

196
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:26,761
And then he says, and can there be an axe there?

197
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,521
Yvonne interrupted carelessly.

198
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:34,681
He was exerting himself to the utmost not to believe in the delusion and not to sink into complete insanity.

199
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:36,281
So there's the two directions.

200
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,681
I mean, he wants the devil to be real.

201
00:18:38,681 --> 00:18:46,121
He knows that if he takes the devil to be real, he will be, so to speak, exonerated for all the bad things in him, but he'll be crazy.

202
00:18:46,121 --> 00:18:47,800
And he doesn't want to be crazy.

203
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,320
So, and the devil is sort of playing on that.

204
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,880
Now, where am I?

205
00:18:55,161 --> 00:19:08,600
So, the devil, then, I'm trying to say, is not an existentialized version of some Christian sacrament or symbol.

206
00:19:08,841 --> 00:19:22,921
The devil is a real psychological manifestation of what happens if you push the sort of R sub, the R2, negative R2, relation of repudiating half yourself to the limit.

207
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:25,961
So that would lead to madness.

208
00:19:25,961 --> 00:19:28,601
And what's saving him from madness?

209
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:34,360
Well, as usual, when there's a devil around, who comes rushing in?

210
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:35,720
The angel.

211
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:41,720
Alyasha arrives at that point, just when he's beginning to go completely crazy.

212
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,041
And it saves him.

213
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,161
Oh, boy.

214
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,600
I don't understand.

215
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,401
What do I do?

216
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,560
Anybody have to do my dude?

217
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,880
Do I touch this?

218
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:51,080
I don't think so.

219
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,840
Very strange.

220
00:19:52,841 --> 00:19:56,921
Well, if anybody discovers what I do to make all that noise, please tell me.

221
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,961
I'll try to stop.

222
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:14,800
Okay, so there isn't any Satan, but it's giving Yvonne a new insight into himself by putting him in this position of having to repudiate himself and so forth.

223
00:20:23,921 --> 00:20:33,040
So on page 617, he explains it to Alyasha, the ta.

224
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,121
You would have driven him away.

225
00:20:37,121 --> 00:20:38,480
You did drive him away.

226
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,321
Of course, angels drive devils away.

227
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,921
He disappeared when you arrived.

228
00:20:41,921 --> 00:20:43,360
I love your face, Alyasha.

229
00:20:43,361 --> 00:20:44,480
Did you know I loved your face?

230
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,480
And he is myself, Alyasha.

231
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,361
All that's base in me, all that's mean and contemptible.

232
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:51,201
See the dark side in him.

233
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,681
He kept haunting me with believing in him.

234
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:54,641
I skipped a little.

235
00:20:54,641 --> 00:20:56,880
And that was how he made me listen to him.

236
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:59,760
He followed me like a boy.

237
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,720
Followed me?

238
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,681
I think it's fooled me in another translation.

239
00:21:03,681 --> 00:21:05,520
I don't see what followed means.

240
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,681
I think it's take a chance.

241
00:21:07,681 --> 00:21:09,121
It's fooled me like a boy.

242
00:21:09,121 --> 00:21:12,240
He told me a great deal that was true about myself, though.

243
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,881
I would never have admitted it to myself.

244
00:21:14,881 --> 00:21:15,921
Do you know, Alyasha?

245
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:18,880
Yvonne added in intense, earnest, and confidential tone.

246
00:21:18,881 --> 00:21:22,161
I would be awfully glad to think it was he and not me.

247
00:21:22,161 --> 00:21:25,600
And there's his point in so many words.

248
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,040
And that's the whole story going on there.

249
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:44,120
Now, the little standing back, it's just as it's interesting, and I tried to do it the last time, think about what prayer means in the various stages of Christianity, from Markle to Zosama to Alyasha.

250
00:21:44,441 --> 00:21:50,441
So you could ask yourself, well, what do the devils mean in various stages?

251
00:21:50,441 --> 00:21:57,160
Well, the worst, the craziest view of the devil, I'm not sure these are stages.

252
00:21:57,161 --> 00:21:59,080
Maybe we should take that.

253
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,841
No, never mind stages.

254
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:06,761
But there are three different views of the devil and more and more sophisticated views of the devil.

255
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:15,880
There's Father Farrapont's view of the devil, that there are these ugly creatures with big tails and he goes around slamming the doors on their tails and letting them rot.

256
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:18,600
That is, and there's a whole bunch of them.

257
00:22:18,601 --> 00:22:27,401
And there's Zostama's view of people who see devils.

258
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:35,161
I couldn't find the quote, but I think somewhere it says that Zosima gives people medicine.

259
00:22:35,161 --> 00:22:36,361
They blame him for that.

260
00:22:36,681 --> 00:22:46,120
That he thinks that there are certain kinds of hallucinations, and I think the devil is one of them, that Zosima thinks you should give people medicine for.

261
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:56,280
And I guess the most sophisticated view would be Dostoevsky's own view that you existentialize the devil as Rakhitan.

262
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:04,840
And you say the devil is are, devils are people who bring out the worst in other people and delight in their despair.

263
00:23:05,161 --> 00:23:07,240
And they're not real.

264
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,201
I mean, they are real.

265
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:10,120
They're not hallucinations.

266
00:23:10,361 --> 00:23:16,681
So that that's really the I mean that's well, that that's various views.

267
00:23:16,681 --> 00:23:22,760
I don't, I mean, now that I say all that, I don't think that's all that interesting because it doesn't map onto the three stages.

268
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,720
They're just, so you could forget that what I just said if you want.

269
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,520
I don't think it's wrong.

270
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,320
Don't think it's deep.

271
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,161
So let's go to something deeper.

272
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:33,280
We're going to go now to where we were heading last time.

273
00:23:33,601 --> 00:23:40,400
It would have been nicer as far as the whole symmetry of lectures go to have had this last time, but time ran out.

274
00:23:41,681 --> 00:23:54,240
There's one sort of one shoe hasn't dropped, and that means that there's something important going on here that we haven't talked about, namely how Yvonne is the wrong kind of crucifixion.

275
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:11,120
There is, we've seen that Dimitri is existentialized, crucifixion, suffering on the cross, all of his way of talking, which leads him to be reborn, a new man, in joy, to arise, to have arisen.

276
00:24:11,361 --> 00:24:14,961
That's resurrection talk.

277
00:24:14,961 --> 00:24:16,560
But what about Yvonne?

278
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:29,600
Remember, I said at the very beginning last time, there are two parts of Christianity, a kind of masochistic part that wallows in suffering, of which I think the movie, what's his name, the movie, the Passion?

279
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,201
Mel Gibson, the Mel Gibson movie, he is certainly in that tradition.

280
00:24:35,201 --> 00:24:49,840
And then there's the, and that kind of crucifixion, Dostoevsky thing, that sort of wallows in the suffering and paints pictures of the suffering, makes movies about the suffering, that doesn't lead to resurrection.

281
00:24:49,841 --> 00:24:57,520
That's a form of laceration, and that's going to lead, at the extreme, to death.

282
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:06,320
But it's going to be told as sort of the negative version, the wrong way of understanding crucifixion.

283
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,760
And there are people in the book who have that.

284
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:16,601
And the question, and Yvonne is the person who has it perfectly.

285
00:25:16,921 --> 00:25:22,760
He is the, so to speak, incarnation of the wrong kind of crucifixion.

286
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,880
Don't say it that way.

287
00:25:23,881 --> 00:25:25,240
That's confusing.

288
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:25,720
Okay.

289
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,161
Here's what happens.

290
00:25:27,161 --> 00:25:33,320
Now, remember, Dimitri gets happier and happier and talking about singing a hymn and being reborn.

291
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,681
Here's how Yvonne ends up crucified and suffering.

292
00:25:39,401 --> 00:25:47,320
On 646, the second paragraph, Yvonne is now at the trial, in the middle of the second paragraph.

293
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:53,400
Yvonne walked up very slowly, looking at no one, with his head bowed as though plunged in gloomy thought.

294
00:25:53,401 --> 00:25:55,240
He was irreproachably dressed.

295
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,161
He's always impeccable.

296
00:25:57,401 --> 00:26:01,161
But his face made a painful impression on me at least.

297
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:11,081
Notice in the trial and so forth, the omniscient, but not very smart, narrator comes back every once in a while, who's the person in the town.

298
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,201
That's the me.

299
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,881
On me at least, there was an earthy look to it.

300
00:26:15,881 --> 00:26:18,441
It looked like a dying man.

301
00:26:18,441 --> 00:26:19,880
That's the crucial thing.

302
00:26:19,881 --> 00:26:20,840
You'll see more.

303
00:26:21,161 --> 00:26:27,720
If you're crucified the wrong way, instead of being reborn to a new and better life, you're just dead.

304
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:34,441
And Dostoevsky, of course, isn't going to let you miss that.

305
00:26:40,121 --> 00:26:54,280
First, Yvonne gets a chance to do what he said, what the devil told him he wanted to do, and what he said he wanted to do, was to, so to sort of speak, spit on the faces of all the people who are at the trial, who feel that they're good and that he's bad.

306
00:26:54,280 --> 00:28:32,121
He wants to show that he's the good one and they're the bad ones and he says at the bottom of 647 they all desire the death of their fathers this made a big impression on Freud there and wrote an article about it but there was no reason why Dostoevsky has to say that but that's just because he has this some of these amazing intuitions one reptile devours another if there hadn't been a murder they'd have been angry and gone home disappointed it's a spectacle they want bread and circuses though I am not one to talk now he's realizing that he's also implicated that's what he realized with the devil that's why he was going crazy that he's equally sadistic equally wanting to kill his father equally a murderer or more than anybody else that here's and will Dostoevsky hit your head hit you over the head with the fact that this is a kind of negative version of the crucifixion the wrong way to suffer the amazing thing is he does it at the top of 648 he always does it and the last thing he says is have you any water give me a drink for Christ's sake he suddenly clutched his head so there you go those who know the Bible that's in one gospel if anybody here know which one it where Jesus says he's thirsty I think it must be John so in the Gospel of John let's say Jesus says something and they say what he they they translate it as he's saying give me a drink so what do we that's just to tell you yeah Ivonne is crucified, all right and and carrying a cross, all right.

307
00:28:32,121 --> 00:28:42,921
Remember, we talked about how the first bullish he was bent over with his left shoulder lower than his right, like, I guess, like that, and staggered as he walked because he was carrying this heavy cross.

308
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:55,641
From the beginning of the book, he's been the person suffering the wrong way, and now he's just told that, and instead of being resurrected, he's going to die, it looks like.

309
00:28:55,881 --> 00:28:57,640
He had the look of a dying man.

310
00:28:58,681 --> 00:29:04,120
If you suffer the wrong way, you get crucified, all right, but you don't get resurrected.

311
00:29:04,121 --> 00:29:13,560
And suffering the wrong way is suffering with pride, suffering to somehow prove something, suffering to show you're better than other people, and so forth.

312
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,441
So that's the end of Yvonne, it looks like.

313
00:29:16,441 --> 00:29:31,320
In fact, it's not really the end of Yvonne, because we know from one sentence, which I'll come across in a minute and tell you, that he didn't die, that he came very close to dying, and we don't know why he didn't die in this book, but something saved him.

314
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,160
I suppose it was probably Alyasha.

315
00:29:33,161 --> 00:29:34,120
We just don't know.

316
00:29:34,121 --> 00:29:42,201
But at this moment, it looks like he's definitely losing his wits and his life.

317
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,001
So Yvonne sums up what's going on with Ivan in his prayer on 745.

318
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,201
It's interesting that Dostoevsky is very clever there.

319
00:30:00,681 --> 00:30:03,240
No, not 745, 619.

320
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:10,441
He wants to sort of give the final view on Yvonne, right where I should be giving it now.

321
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:13,641
But he can't just sort of interrupt and say it.

322
00:30:13,641 --> 00:30:16,681
He can't have the rather stupid narrator say it.

323
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:23,640
So it finally, and the only person who has a right to say it and who understands enough to explain it is Alyasha.

324
00:30:24,121 --> 00:30:27,560
So he's going to explain what is happening with Yvonne.

325
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:32,560
I mean, I've sort of explained it my way, but I think it's important to see how Alyasha says it.

326
00:30:32,641 --> 00:30:34,961
The middle of 619.

327
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:40,880
And this is, it may be an explanation, and that's certainly what Dostoevsky wants us to understand.

328
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:43,120
But boy, is it hard and obscure.

329
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:48,240
I don't think I fully understand it even now after years of help and trying.

330
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,760
So if anybody understands it better, get ready to help.

331
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,760
We're in the middle of 619.

332
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,280
This is his prayer.

333
00:30:55,441 --> 00:30:57,201
Or this is what Alyasha thinks.

334
00:30:57,201 --> 00:31:00,800
Alyasha took a pillow and lay down on the sofa without undressing.

335
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:06,400
As he fell asleep, he prayed for Dimitri and Yvonne, and he began to understand Yvonne's illness.

336
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:09,441
Now we're going to understand Yvonne's illness.

337
00:31:09,441 --> 00:31:15,121
The agony of proud determination, conscience.

338
00:31:15,761 --> 00:31:18,480
Now, that's his illness.

339
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,120
The agony of proud determination, conscience.

340
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,121
That is, that's what I've been calling, and Dostoevsky is calling pride.

341
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:35,201
Now, God, in whom Yvonne disbelieved and his truth were gaining mastery over his heart, which still refused to submit.

342
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,201
Well, let's start with that.

343
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,560
What does that mean?

344
00:31:38,881 --> 00:31:40,721
That is tough.

345
00:31:41,361 --> 00:31:42,721
Anybody know?

346
00:31:42,721 --> 00:31:43,841
Well, let's start.

347
00:31:43,841 --> 00:31:45,041
What is God?

348
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:50,801
God, remember in Dostoevsky, don't have your stock responses to God being the supreme being.

349
00:31:50,801 --> 00:31:56,801
God is the connectedness of everything that Alyasha experiences.

350
00:31:56,801 --> 00:32:01,121
And God is winning out with Yvonne.

351
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,120
How is God winning out with Yvonne?

352
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,561
Has Yvonne understood the connectedness of things?

353
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,480
Yes, in a way.

354
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,160
That's what's getting at him.

355
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,961
He discovers that he's implicated in the murder.

356
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:18,281
Just how he's implicated in the murder, we haven't got to yet, but I'm afraid I'll get to today.

357
00:32:18,281 --> 00:32:21,241
How many know how Yvonne is implicated in the murder?

358
00:32:21,881 --> 00:32:22,840
Oh, good.

359
00:32:22,841 --> 00:32:23,720
More, I hope.

360
00:32:23,721 --> 00:32:34,761
Well, anyway, okay, but I have to tell you, Yvonne is very implicated in the murder, and that means that he's implicated in a way, which is very interesting.

361
00:32:34,761 --> 00:32:43,640
It's his disconnectedness and detachment which has implicated him and attached him to the murder.

362
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,320
It's such a brilliant plot.

363
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:50,601
But in any case, so in that way, sort of connectedness is winning out over him.

364
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,401
Yes, the thought floated through Alyasha's mind.

365
00:32:53,401 --> 00:32:57,480
Yes, if Snerzhikov is dead, no one will believe Yvonne's evidence.

366
00:32:57,801 --> 00:32:59,641
I wonder if I should read this later.

367
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,760
I think I have to.

368
00:33:00,761 --> 00:33:03,000
We have to wait till Snerzhikov is dead.

369
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,921
And what's well, I can tell you a bit.

370
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,601
Can I tell you anything?

371
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,561
Not really.

372
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,480
Okay, I think that's a mistake for me to try to put that there.

373
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:18,280
I'm going to take it out of the lecture right now because I'll talk about it, but later.

374
00:33:18,921 --> 00:33:20,280
So there's a prayer.

375
00:33:20,281 --> 00:33:21,320
I have written more here.

376
00:33:21,321 --> 00:33:27,641
A way of meditating on Yvonne's condition with compassion so that he can understand it clearly.

377
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,401
And help the connectedness get to Yvonne.

378
00:33:31,961 --> 00:33:37,480
So what would it mean that Yvonne is, that God is gaining control?

379
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:44,841
Well, it would mean that Yvonne is in the world and he's responsible for the evil in the world, whether he likes it or not.

380
00:33:44,841 --> 00:33:51,161
And that responsibility is getting through to him by way of his implication in his father's murder.

381
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:58,721
And so, but Yvonne is still resisting this kind of interdependence.

382
00:33:57,801 --> 00:34:03,361
And never mind about Smezhikov confessing, I can read the rest of it anyway.

383
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,441
He thinks, Alyasha thinks God will conquer, he thought.

384
00:34:07,441 --> 00:34:08,801
This is the hardest part.

385
00:34:08,801 --> 00:34:27,201
Yvonne will either rise up in the light of truth, that would mean that he would recognize the connectedness and be reborn, arisen, like Dmitry, or he'll perish in hate, revenging on himself and on everyone his having served a cause he does not believe in.

386
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:45,441
That means he never accepts the relatedness, but he pretends to accept the relatedness in order to look good because he knows that, and now we're going to have to find out more about the plot, knows things about what really happened in the murder.

387
00:34:45,761 --> 00:34:48,561
And so something like this.

388
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:58,081
Yvonne either has to accept the fundamental truth that all creatures are interrelated, that's God, and admit his involvement.

389
00:34:58,241 --> 00:35:16,081
Now comes the very obscure part, or else he'll destroy everything in himself and everyone else who questions his self-sufficiency, his purity, and his perfection, and which reminds him in any way of his complicity in the suffering of the world.

390
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,241
So he is involved.

391
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:32,401
He knows he's an accomplice, but he's got this struggle that he might, and that's what the devil, he might go mad and die as the one way not to accept God, not to accept his relatedness.

392
00:35:32,401 --> 00:35:34,400
And it just left open here.

393
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:37,120
So Alyasha is praying for Yvonne.

394
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:43,801
That is, he's praying to understand Yvonne so that he can help Yvonne and keep him from perishing in hate.

395
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:49,560
And somehow he does understand him and help him, but there's nothing in this book that tells us he's done.

396
00:35:49,721 --> 00:35:53,720
After the confession, I don't think he, after the trial, he don't ever hear anything more about it.

397
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,800
I don't remember that we do.

398
00:35:55,801 --> 00:35:58,361
He's just, he's as good as dead.

399
00:35:58,361 --> 00:35:58,840
Yeah.

400
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,480
Having told Yvonne this confession.

401
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,880
He wants to point out the connectedness.

402
00:36:07,881 --> 00:36:14,840
That he was, yeah, tightly interconnected, even though he doesn't believe in interconnection.

403
00:36:14,841 --> 00:36:24,920
Yeah, that's the plot is so well worked out to show this peculiar thing that Yvonne is connected by way of being disconnected.

404
00:36:24,921 --> 00:36:26,841
And that's what we have to see now.

405
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,080
Now we're going to go to Yvonne's.

406
00:36:29,241 --> 00:36:31,720
Well, that was a good stopping point for a minute.

407
00:36:31,721 --> 00:36:34,601
So, anybody want to say anything about any of this?

408
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,480
It's sort of hard, but it's not impossible.

409
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,121
Yeah.

410
00:36:54,281 --> 00:36:56,040
That's why he's all messed up, right?

411
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,360
Because he wants to deny the connectedness.

412
00:36:58,361 --> 00:37:01,641
He wants to be autonomous and self-sufficient.

413
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:09,721
And in showing that he's autonomous and self-sufficient, it turns out that's just exactly how he got involved.

414
00:37:09,721 --> 00:37:11,160
And so he's in trouble.

415
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,040
I mean, we have to say now, it's not a secret.

416
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,961
We're going to get there probably before the end.

417
00:37:15,961 --> 00:37:21,241
But so far, we know what his, what this mysterious thing we're all talking about.

418
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:25,800
Well, how did his detachment turn out to be part of the problem?

419
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:37,921
Well, he made a deal with Smershikov to leave town so that Smershikov could sham a fit so that Dmitry could run in and kill Terematsov.

420
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:42,721
So at least, this is the first thing we know, at least he is...

421
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:44,080
Saying, I don't care.

422
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,600
I'm not my brother's keeper.

423
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,321
And I'm certainly not going to save my father's life.

424
00:37:48,321 --> 00:37:49,441
I'm going to go.

425
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:53,120
And if Smershikov wants to kill him, then that's okay.

426
00:37:53,441 --> 00:37:58,801
And Dmitry's really the one who's going to kill him because Dmitry's been threatening to do that all along.

427
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,080
So that's it.

428
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,600
It's the leaving town.

429
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,560
It's the verse that's sung by that peasant.

430
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,561
Vanka's gone to Petersburg, and I won't wait till his return.

431
00:38:08,881 --> 00:38:18,321
So, in fact, Dmitry, sorry, Ivan has gone to Moscow, and somebody didn't wait till his return, but killed old Terematsov.

432
00:38:18,321 --> 00:38:24,801
And Ivan knows that if he hadn't gone to Moscow, the old guy wouldn't have been murdered.

433
00:38:24,801 --> 00:38:29,841
And he also knows that if he does go to Moscow, the old guy will be murdered.

434
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:37,600
And that's what he knows when he stands on the stairs that he always looking back felt was the most awful thing he did in his life, listening to old Terematsov.

435
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:48,000
He was listening to what he thought was the last night that old Terematsov would be walking around in his room and so forth.

436
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:56,401
So he knows that he's responsible, sort of, for the murder.

437
00:38:56,401 --> 00:39:06,241
And that's driving him crazy, because that means that his very attempt to say, I'm not responsible, I'm leaving, is the main thing that made the murder possible.

438
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,120
Good.

439
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,401
That's clear?

440
00:39:08,401 --> 00:39:09,041
Okay.

441
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,760
Anything else?

442
00:39:09,761 --> 00:39:11,120
If it's not clear, you should ask.

443
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,961
Or if it's clearer than I've made it, you should tell me.

444
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:23,081
Well, it's got to be murky at first, because the whole point is that Yvonne doesn't understand his role in the murder.

445
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:27,561
Even what I just said is not his role in the murder.

446
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,081
What I just said is how he understands his role.

447
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:40,520
At this point in the book, now he's going to have three interviews with Smershikov that are going to change his understanding and make everything much worse.

448
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:46,441
And the prayer that I read sort of prematurely is really after he fully understands.

449
00:39:46,441 --> 00:39:49,561
And that's what almost kills him.

450
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,360
That's when he's dying on the cross.

451
00:39:52,361 --> 00:39:53,720
So let's go into it now.

452
00:39:53,721 --> 00:40:12,361
For the rest of the time, we have three interviews with Smershikov, which are going to finally clear up this very, very purposefully murky plot that Jostovsky has put in here.

453
00:40:12,361 --> 00:40:14,841
So let's look at that now.

454
00:40:14,841 --> 00:40:22,361
Starting with something that's not yet the plot, but we've never discussed enough Ivan's relation to Smershikov.

455
00:40:22,361 --> 00:40:33,640
And it's another case of his making a kind of parody of his own ideas, showing that they can be wrong versions of them.

456
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:38,600
Remember, that's what we just said: is that where was my last one?

457
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Something where he shows you the wrong version of it.

458
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,200
Could be suffering.

459
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,921
Yeah, the masochistic version.

460
00:40:48,921 --> 00:40:52,681
Here he's going to show you the wrong version of a defining commitment.

461
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,520
We know that Alyasha has a defining commitment to Zosima.

462
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,240
It turns out that there is also a sick defining commitment.

463
00:41:00,241 --> 00:41:08,881
If you say to Dostoevsky or to Kierkegaard, yeah, but if you get your whole being of your life out of devotion to somebody else, that's sick.

464
00:41:08,881 --> 00:41:12,721
You have to have a sense of your own independent value.

465
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:14,720
And Kierkegaard says, yes, you do.

466
00:41:14,721 --> 00:41:16,961
You've got to have a sense of your own value.

467
00:41:16,961 --> 00:41:26,400
You can't just be, and you have to be able, in principle, you know that you could always break out of the defining relation and you'd still have something.

468
00:41:26,721 --> 00:41:36,561
But there's a defining commitment which is so much of a dependency that there's nothing left of the person who has it.

469
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,000
They're just defined as the lover of such and such.

470
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,561
Yeah.

471
00:41:41,841 --> 00:41:50,241
I don't know if you like the way that I actually believe you definitely.

472
00:41:50,801 --> 00:41:53,280
Boy, you're really following this very well.

473
00:41:53,281 --> 00:41:54,240
I'm impressed.

474
00:41:54,241 --> 00:42:00,000
I sort of fudged that, you know, and I thought I don't want to go into detail, but now let me think about it.

475
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,561
Yes, you lose your identity and you lose your world.

476
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:15,201
But there's something else, which is something like your eternal validity, which is what you have when you make the movements of resignation.

477
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:21,361
And he says you discover your eternal validity.

478
00:42:21,361 --> 00:42:36,641
I think that means something like that, though you've lost your identity and your world, there's still something about you that enables you either to go into resignation or to go into faith.

479
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:48,360
And that's some freedom you've got to do something even when you've lost yourself in your world.

480
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:53,961
I mean, this I am certainly not very helpful.

481
00:42:54,281 --> 00:42:54,921
That's right.

482
00:42:54,921 --> 00:42:57,080
No, I meant that you could choose at this point.

483
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:05,480
Remember, there's this funny point where you make the movements of resignation and, oh, well, we're all back in Kierkegaard.

484
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:09,961
You can make the movements of resignation without becoming a knight of resignation.

485
00:43:09,961 --> 00:43:20,201
The movement of resignation is to discover your eternal validity, which means some ultimate thing about you, which is the part of you that can freely choose.

486
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:31,801
And then you can either make the movement of resignation, having, oh, sorry, then you make the movement of resignation, that you realize the part of you that can freely choose.

487
00:43:31,801 --> 00:43:36,120
Then you can either become a knight of resignation, and then that's when you're stuck.

488
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,721
That's what you're talking about.

489
00:43:37,721 --> 00:43:39,881
Or you can become a knight of faith.

490
00:43:39,881 --> 00:43:45,161
Or you can go back to lower immediacy and become like a butterfly caterpillar.

491
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:57,161
So you have this minimal kind of not your identity, not your world, but your ability to choose which kind of life you're going to lead in Kierkegaard.

492
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:05,320
And that's compatible with your whole world going crash, because there's still you there experiencing grief when your whole world and identity crashes.

493
00:44:05,321 --> 00:44:08,601
That's the you that has this eternal validity.

494
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,041
Does that help any?

495
00:44:11,321 --> 00:44:12,200
Okay, good.

496
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,760
You don't seem too convinced, but I don't blame you.

497
00:44:14,761 --> 00:44:16,361
It's not too.

498
00:44:16,361 --> 00:44:18,121
But there's a right question.

499
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:21,561
Okay, I left myself open for that one.

500
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:25,161
But now we're back in Dostoevsky.

501
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:48,721
And in Dostoevsky, we're going to see a character who has no eternal validity to talk Irkevard jargon, no self, and gets all of the meaning of his life by his total sort of parasitical dependence and devotion on somebody else.

502
00:44:48,721 --> 00:44:50,560
And you know who that is, I presume.

503
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:52,561
Who's that?

504
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,721
Hmm?

505
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,361
Somebody said it.

506
00:44:59,281 --> 00:45:01,040
Smerzhikov, I think somebody said that.

507
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,000
Did somebody say that, or did I just hallucinate you?

508
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:04,800
You said it.

509
00:45:04,801 --> 00:45:05,361
Okay.

510
00:45:05,361 --> 00:45:13,120
Anyway, it's Smerzhikov who is plugged into Yvonne and gets everything from Yvonne.

511
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:22,561
His motivations, his philosophy, his understanding of what people can and should do, everything.

512
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,320
But we have to work that out in detail.

513
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:26,080
It's brilliant in Dostoevsky.

514
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:33,601
It's very, very important that Dostoevsky wants somehow to.

515
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,480
I don't know if I'm ready to say this yet.

516
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,600
No, never mind.

517
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,320
Let's go back.

518
00:45:38,321 --> 00:45:51,840
So here we're going to go to Smershikov, whose relation to Yvonne is a kind of parody, a sick version, would be the best way to put it, of the relation of Zosima and Alyasha.

519
00:45:51,841 --> 00:46:07,600
Alyasha gets the whole meaning of his life from Zosima, but not the way, not the kind of total parasitical way that Smerzhikov gets the whole meaning of his life from Ivonne.

520
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,480
So let's start in 573.

521
00:46:11,441 --> 00:46:16,441
All these interviews are so interesting, and you've got to go through them slow because everything in here is important.

522
00:46:16,761 --> 00:46:22,281
On 573, he says about two-thirds down, why should I play with you?

523
00:46:22,281 --> 00:46:32,040
Smershikov says to Yvonne, when I put my whole trust in you as in God Almighty, which is to say, you are my totally defining person.

524
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:40,121
And he says it again.

525
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,160
He says it again later, but I don't know where, so we'll wait.

526
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,201
I'll get there.

527
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:50,361
So everything about him he gets from Yvonne.

528
00:46:50,361 --> 00:46:57,241
Dimitri talks of him as if he had no sort of self and no life of his own.

529
00:46:57,241 --> 00:47:01,321
Remember, he has no self of his own.

530
00:47:01,321 --> 00:47:09,241
That is, ever since Gregory said that he has no self, he's not a person, he grew from the mildew in the bathhouse.

531
00:47:09,241 --> 00:47:11,080
We discover that he has no side.

532
00:47:11,321 --> 00:47:14,681
Remember, he has no dark side and no bright side.

533
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,921
He has no divided self at all.

534
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:22,201
He's the last moment he had any divided self was when he was hanging the cats.

535
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,200
I noticed something new, by the way.

536
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:32,841
It doesn't mean anything, but he's the one who told Ilusha to put a pin in the meat and throw it for the dog.

537
00:47:32,841 --> 00:47:35,480
He seems to be like a lot of, he seems to be sad.

538
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,280
Yvonne is sadistic at a high level.

539
00:47:38,281 --> 00:47:51,721
He's sadistic about people, and himself, masochistic, but more sadistic when he goes to Lisa and says it was good that she slammed the door on her thumb and was bleeding and so and and so forth.

540
00:47:51,721 --> 00:47:59,360
But it's it's as if, I've never said this before, but it seems to me it's like Smershikov is a kind of parody.

541
00:47:57,801 --> 00:48:01,600
He's a kind of animal saddest.

542
00:47:57,881 --> 00:48:04,401
He seems to be very mean to cats and dogs.

543
00:48:04,721 --> 00:48:09,360
And that's with people, he doesn't have any view, any impulses of his own.

544
00:48:09,841 --> 00:48:15,520
That's all he's got for impulses that he didn't get from Yvonne is how to be mean to cats and dogs.

545
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,241
Yeah.

546
00:48:19,441 --> 00:48:21,520
He doesn't have a self-right.

547
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,161
He feels closer.

548
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,600
He likes animals better.

549
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,721
Is that what you said?

550
00:48:26,721 --> 00:48:28,080
Well, he likes to torture them.

551
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,081
It's a hard, funny kind of liking.

552
00:48:30,961 --> 00:48:32,800
But anyway, I never thought of it before.

553
00:48:32,801 --> 00:48:49,681
But it does, yes, he's got this interesting problem of inventing the something-like human being, which isn't quite really a human being because he hasn't got the basic defining thing about a human being, namely that he's got these two factors, that he's got to take a stand on these two factors.

554
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,520
He doesn't have any factors, and he doesn't have to take a stand on any of these factors.

555
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,961
And then you ask, well, how can he be anything like a human being?

556
00:48:56,961 --> 00:49:06,480
And the answer is only by living through Yvonne and taking over, in a way, Yvonne's way of his way of life.

557
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,121
Yeah.

558
00:49:17,441 --> 00:49:18,561
His what?

559
00:49:20,801 --> 00:49:23,120
When framing Dimitri with the murder.

560
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,160
Yeah, I suppose.

561
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,680
I don't call that sadistic.

562
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,881
He's clever.

563
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:29,520
I mean, he's that's another feature he's got.

564
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:36,401
Without he gets, I mean, he didn't get clever from Yvonne, though he uses his cleverness to imitate Yvonne.

565
00:49:36,401 --> 00:49:40,000
He just, that's just cleverness, I think, that he's protecting himself.

566
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:49,800
He's what he really wants to do is commit a murder and then go and go to France and live off the money, or go, remember, that was his plan.

567
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,041
That's all just cleverness.

568
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:52,761
Yeah.

569
00:49:52,761 --> 00:49:53,320
Yeah.

570
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:08,600
Well, not really.

571
00:50:08,841 --> 00:50:10,680
I don't think she's ever described that way.

572
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,281
She's a holy fool.

573
00:50:12,281 --> 00:50:29,720
I think, I mean, you don't get much of it in the book, but apparently people took these people who were insane and couldn't take care of themselves and weren't selfish and weren't possessive and were sort of street person, really, and took them and took care of them and thought of them as sort of saintly.

574
00:50:29,721 --> 00:50:31,560
So I don't think she's like an animal.

575
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,801
That's just a direction that doesn't work, I think.

576
00:50:35,801 --> 00:50:37,000
Did I see another hand?

577
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:37,400
Yeah.

578
00:50:44,921 --> 00:50:49,640
With how Collins found that a lot of murders animals children?

579
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,841
Who I thought, you know what I thought that personal said?

580
00:50:55,721 --> 00:50:56,841
No, I don't know.

581
00:50:56,841 --> 00:51:17,240
But it's funny, I mean, not funny, but interesting that Dostoevsky has thought of this idea that this murderer does abuse animals, but he hasn't even, I want to make clear, I mean, we just don't put too much interpretation into the psychology of him, because he only is a murderer because he thinks Yvonne wants him to be a murderer.

582
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:18,600
We have to find that out.

583
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:31,281
He hasn't got any motivations of his own, except the only two motivations of his own we know is that he puts a pin in the meat for the dog and he kills and does ceremonies over cats.

584
00:51:31,281 --> 00:51:35,681
Everything else he does is a kind of parody of Yvonne.

585
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,560
And we're supposed to understand that he's sort of Yvonne's double.

586
00:51:40,721 --> 00:51:44,241
Dostoevsky hints at that because they're the same age.

587
00:51:44,241 --> 00:51:50,160
And that's sort of, you're supposed to see that there's some deep something going on between them.

588
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:58,401
And I've only been talking about it in the direction of how Smershakov sort of is plugged into getting all of his motivations from Yvonne.

589
00:51:58,401 --> 00:52:11,361
But Yvonne, I'll say it now, but we have to see it in more detail, is plugged into Smershakov as the way to enact his darkest desires without being responsible for them.

590
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:18,000
Because he wants to get Smerzhikov to help him get Dmitry to kill old Karamatsov.

591
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,681
And Yvonne really wants to kill old Karamatsov, it turns out, but he's not going to do it.

592
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:35,041
He wants, and Smershikov enables him to sort of take all of his evil impulses and act on them without, seemingly without being responsible for them.

593
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,080
Of course, it turns out that he is responsible for them.

594
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,760
But that we have, they've got to.

595
00:52:39,761 --> 00:52:42,800
We're all still in the complications of the plot.

596
00:52:42,801 --> 00:52:44,081
Let's go on.

597
00:52:44,721 --> 00:52:45,520
And where are we?

598
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,600
Smerzhikov needs, is he?

599
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,080
Okay, total dependence.

600
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:50,480
Yeah.

601
00:52:50,801 --> 00:52:53,761
He needs something from Yvonne.

602
00:52:53,761 --> 00:52:59,520
And we have to see what he needs and why he gets it from Yvonne.

603
00:52:59,841 --> 00:53:09,881
And you see something of that when you get Dmitry's characterization of Smerzhikov at the trial, which I think is on 454.

604
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:14,121
Here we are.

605
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:20,680
This is the sort of sense in which he's got no self, no motives, and so forth.

606
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,441
Dimitri sees that.

607
00:53:22,841 --> 00:53:27,321
The big middle paragraph skipping in to the end of the first line.

608
00:53:27,321 --> 00:53:30,600
Smerzhikov is a man of the lowest character and a coward.

609
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,401
He's not a coward.

610
00:53:31,401 --> 00:53:34,441
He's the epitome of cowards in the world, walking on two legs.

611
00:53:34,441 --> 00:53:36,201
He has the heart of a chicken.

612
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,041
And then skipping away down.

613
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,560
He doesn't care for money.

614
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,480
He wouldn't take my presence.

615
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,520
Besides, what motive had he for murdering the old man?

616
00:53:44,841 --> 00:53:45,881
That's enough.

617
00:53:45,881 --> 00:53:50,520
I mean, the idea is that he doesn't have any motives at all.

618
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:58,840
So Dmitry thinks there's no, it couldn't have been Smerzhikov that killed old Karamatsov.

619
00:53:58,841 --> 00:54:01,561
So it's looking more and more unclear who could have done it.

620
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:08,361
And the way Gusti sets it up, it's true that on his own, he couldn't have killed old Karamatsov.

621
00:54:08,361 --> 00:54:10,121
That's very important.

622
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:19,480
And why does he attach himself to Yvonne and imitate him rather than say Dmitri or Alyasha?

623
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:29,161
Well, that's because Yvonne, like Yvonne, Smerzhikov has no sense of involvement, no sense of guilt.

624
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:38,841
All he's got, and that's partly what I said to him, is that he's clever and he has contempt for everybody, and he's detached and ironic and conceited.

625
00:54:38,841 --> 00:54:47,000
I mean, I don't know how much of that he gets from Yvonne and how much of that is what makes him attach himself to Yvonne.

626
00:54:48,361 --> 00:54:49,640
We don't know that.

627
00:54:49,961 --> 00:54:51,961
But he begins to imitate Yvonne.

628
00:54:51,961 --> 00:54:53,961
He imitates his fastidiousness.

629
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:56,681
Remember, he's always impeccably dressed.

630
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:03,921
He imitates his being anti-Russian, his being anti-Christian, his being pro-French, all of those things.

631
00:55:04,401 --> 00:55:07,921
On 129, you hear about that.

632
00:55:10,961 --> 00:55:14,801
I think I read this once way back, but I read it again.

633
00:55:15,441 --> 00:55:18,241
The end of that big paragraph on 129.

634
00:55:18,241 --> 00:55:25,760
He came to us from Moscow after he went off to cooking class, well dressed in a clean coat and clean linen.

635
00:55:25,761 --> 00:55:34,561
He brushed his clothes most scrupulously twice a day and was very fond of cleaning his smart calf boots with a special English polish so that they shone like mirrors.

636
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:42,241
And right after that, it says, which I did read, he's got contempt for the female sex as for men and so forth.

637
00:55:42,721 --> 00:55:45,600
So that he has no sensuous side whatsoever.

638
00:55:46,241 --> 00:55:48,320
Those are the things that would make him a self.

639
00:55:48,321 --> 00:55:52,881
And he's imitating Yvonne in the way he's polishing his boots.

640
00:55:52,881 --> 00:55:56,721
On 696, there's more about that.

641
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,401
Sort of a little below the middle.

642
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,721
But this is his view of Russia.

643
00:56:10,721 --> 00:56:15,120
Of course, people who don't like Russia are really bad guys for Dostoevsky.

644
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:18,081
And he, like Yvonne, doesn't like Russia.

645
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,600
This one is about Smershikov.

646
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,280
He cursed and jeered at Russia.

647
00:56:21,281 --> 00:56:24,080
He dreamed of going to France and becoming a Frenchman.

648
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:33,680
He often said that he hadn't the money to do so, I believe, but he loved no one but himself and had a strangely, oh, sorry, money to do so, period.

649
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:37,681
I believe he loved no one but himself and had a strangely high opinion of himself.

650
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:42,961
His conception of culture was limited to good clothes, clean shirts, and polished boots.

651
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:51,081
That's all correct, except the prosecutor who's talking doesn't realize that Smershikov did love Yvonne.

652
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,640
He says he calls it love at one point.

653
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,360
We'll see.

654
00:56:54,361 --> 00:57:01,081
I mean, that means he just is totally attached to him, gets all the meaning of his life from him.

655
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:12,680
But he has no motive of his own for killing old Karamatso.

656
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,201
Let me see where I am.

657
00:57:19,321 --> 00:57:20,280
454.

658
00:57:20,281 --> 00:57:21,240
Did I just read that?

659
00:57:21,241 --> 00:57:22,681
I think I did.

660
00:57:23,321 --> 00:57:24,601
Did I?

661
00:57:28,761 --> 00:57:29,640
Yeah, I did.

662
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,321
Okay, I see where I am.

663
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:40,681
So all of his motives and his philosophy he gets from Yvonne.

664
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:41,881
Well, I did read all that.

665
00:57:41,881 --> 00:57:45,881
And I just read, okay, and he's against Russia, Christians, and so forth.

666
00:57:45,881 --> 00:57:49,241
That's all 696, which I just read.

667
00:57:49,241 --> 00:57:54,601
And that's all a parody of Yvonne being refined and impeccable and European.

668
00:57:54,600 --> 00:58:01,560
Yvonne says in one point that he wants to go off to Europe and fall on the graves of the great Enlightenment thinkers and weep.

669
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:07,560
It's a kind of interesting, crazy parody of falling on the ground and weeping of the Zosima sort.

670
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:12,681
He's sort of weeping for the Enlightenment, but I didn't read it because it's not central enough here.

671
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:16,761
But he's definitely anti-Russia, definitely pro-Europe.

672
00:58:16,761 --> 00:58:22,921
And 696, I think, I don't know if I've read that either yet, so let's see.

673
00:58:26,441 --> 00:58:28,160
Yeah, that's what now I know where I am.

674
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,280
That's where I just read it.

675
00:58:27,881 --> 00:58:31,121
That's the prosecutors talking.

676
00:58:36,321 --> 00:58:41,441
So, and being a lackey or a valet is the worst thing Ivan can imagine.

677
00:58:41,441 --> 00:58:44,161
That's what he keeps calling the worst side of himself.

678
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,840
So, he really can't stand Smerzhikov.

679
00:58:47,841 --> 00:58:51,761
That makes it all the more strange that he gets so involved with him.

680
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:57,520
But you can see on 258 that he represents just the side of him that he can't stand.

681
00:58:57,921 --> 00:59:05,600
Three-quarters of the way down on 258, on the bench in the gateway, Smerzhikov was sitting enjoying the coolness of the evening.

682
00:59:06,961 --> 00:59:14,561
And at first glance at him, Yvonne knew that it was Smerzhikov who was on his mind and that it was this man that he loathed.

683
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:19,840
Well, that's just to say, of course, that Smerzakov is the lackey side of Yvonne.

684
00:59:19,841 --> 00:59:29,281
He doesn't have a lackey side because he doesn't have sides in himself, but he is like the side of Yvonne that Ivan doesn't want to be.

685
00:59:29,281 --> 00:59:31,201
And so he hates him.

686
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:37,441
And yet, and this is where Dostoevsky starts doing weird things.

687
00:59:37,761 --> 00:59:41,440
He senses that there's some kind of connection between them, which there is.

688
00:59:41,441 --> 00:59:46,401
Smerzhakov is a kind of parody of him and devoted to him.

689
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:51,121
But also, Smerzhikov is trying to involve him in something.

690
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:55,520
So at the middle of that paragraph on 259, 259 now.

691
00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:03,441
But what irritated Ivan most and confirmed his dislike for Smerzhikov was the familiarity which Smerzhikov began to assume.

692
01:00:03,441 --> 01:00:04,560
Excuse me a little.

693
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:11,601
He had obviously begun to consider, goodness knows why, that there was some sort of understanding between them.

694
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:17,161
He always spoke in a tone that suggested that they had some kind of compact, some secret between them.

695
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:32,600
So there's some secret deal that very complicated psychologically, that Ivan senses that Smerzhikov thinks that Ivan has made with Smershikov.

696
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,640
And there is.

697
01:00:33,961 --> 01:00:50,441
But Yvonne has got sort of this ability to screen out of his consciousness sort of the dark impulses and the dark things that he's doing so that he doesn't consciously admit to himself that he's made any kind of deal with Smershikov.

698
01:00:50,441 --> 01:00:54,040
But Smerzhikov thinks he has, and indeed he has.

699
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:10,121
And it's interesting that when he knows this kind of deal, he calls him on Smerzhikov on 265.

700
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:14,600
You seem to be.

701
01:01:14,841 --> 01:01:16,601
What is he saying to him?

702
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,921
Oh, he's advising him to leave town.

703
01:01:20,921 --> 01:01:28,520
This is this sort of murky moment where Ivan makes a deal with Smershikov without admitting to himself that he's made a deal.

704
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:39,801
Smerzhikov is advising him to go away because Dmitry knows where the money is and all that.

705
01:01:40,361 --> 01:01:45,161
And a sort of shudder on the top of 265 passed over Ivan's face.

706
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:45,881
He flushed.

707
01:01:45,881 --> 01:01:51,801
Then why on earth, he suddenly interrupted, you advise me to go to, I wouldn't try to pronounce that, wherever place.

708
01:01:51,801 --> 01:01:53,720
Why did you mean, what did you mean by that?

709
01:01:53,721 --> 01:01:56,441
If I go away, you see what will happen here?

710
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,800
Yvonne drew his breath with difficulty.

711
01:01:58,801 --> 01:02:03,280
Precisely so, said Smerzhikov, softly and reasonably watching Yvonne intensively.

712
01:02:03,281 --> 01:02:05,120
What do you mean by precisely so?

713
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:08,721
Yvonne questioned, restraining himself with difficulty.

714
01:02:08,721 --> 01:02:10,640
I spoke because I felt sorry for you.

715
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:16,000
If I were in your place, I would simply give it all up, answered Smerzhikov with a candid air.

716
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:20,080
And then Yvonne unconsciously understands what he's proposing.

717
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:25,041
And he says, you seem to be a perfect idiot and what's more, an awful scoundrel.

718
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:38,480
Ivan got up suddenly from the bench and he was about to leave, but then just as he, and he looked like he was going to hit Smerzhikov, he has this complicated relation to him.

719
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:43,520
And then he says, I'm going to Moscow tomorrow, if you care to know, early tomorrow morning.

720
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:46,000
That's all, he suddenly said aloud.

721
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:51,041
And he wondered afterward what need there had been to say this to Smershikov.

722
01:02:51,040 --> 01:03:04,561
Okay, so there's the compact, the secret deal that they made, which is, remember, Ivan deciding to wash his hands of it all, to let Dmitry kill Termatsov.

723
01:03:04,801 --> 01:03:35,841
And what's neat, and it's typical Dostoevsky, when he calls Smerzhikov a scoundrel in 265, remember what he says when he's on the train leaving, going to Moscow, having listened to old Terematsov on the steps in the meantime, he's now on the train, and he says to himself in the middle of 271, the train flew on, and only at daybreak, when he was approaching Moscow, did he suddenly rouse himself from his meditation.

724
01:03:35,841 --> 01:03:37,041
I am base.

725
01:03:37,281 --> 01:03:39,520
The other translation, surely right.

726
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,720
You can cross out base.

727
01:03:40,721 --> 01:03:42,000
It says, I am a scoundrel.

728
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:51,800
I mean, I'm sure it's the same Russian word that he accuses Smerzyakov of, that he understands he's implicated in it.

729
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:56,520
He does realize that, sort of, some of the time.

730
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:58,121
Now, let's see.

731
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:00,600
And why is he a scoundrel?

732
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:03,881
Because he's washed his hands of what's going to happen.

733
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:06,041
So now we get the first interview.

734
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:10,121
I think we won't get to the second or third, which is fine.

735
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:15,000
In the first interview, Smerzhikov is extremely weak.

736
01:04:15,321 --> 01:04:19,800
And now you're supposed to be able to figure out after what I've said why.

737
01:04:19,801 --> 01:04:22,441
Because Dostoevsky never tells you why he's weak.

738
01:04:22,761 --> 01:04:25,401
But you're supposed to know why.

739
01:04:25,401 --> 01:04:28,520
So let's just ask you as soon as I read the part.

740
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:33,720
At the bottom of 572, from the first glance, Ivan had no doubt that Smerzhikov was very ill.

741
01:04:33,721 --> 01:04:34,360
He was weak.

742
01:04:34,361 --> 01:04:37,081
He spoke slowly, moving his tongue with difficulty.

743
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:40,121
He was much thinner and more sallow.

744
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:43,240
Now, what happened to Smerzykov?

745
01:04:43,241 --> 01:04:44,280
Why is he sick?

746
01:04:44,281 --> 01:04:45,961
Why is he weak?

747
01:04:46,761 --> 01:04:49,241
How many have read the three interviews already?

748
01:04:49,881 --> 01:04:50,681
Okay.

749
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,200
You notice in the first interview, Smerziakov is very weak.

750
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,360
In the second interview, he's full of pep.

751
01:04:56,361 --> 01:04:59,241
In the third interview, he's even weaker.

752
01:04:59,241 --> 01:05:00,681
What's going on?

753
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:06,041
You're supposed to see it because Dostoevsky never tells you.

754
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:09,080
Well, what's going on is nobody's going to tell me.

755
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:09,401
Yeah.

756
01:05:13,881 --> 01:05:21,601
So, let's not really going to bright side.

757
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,801
No, no, I don't think so.

758
01:05:23,801 --> 01:05:26,040
But I see you're trying.

759
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:30,480
I think you have to understand, and it's sort of subtle and hard to see.

760
01:05:30,481 --> 01:05:31,280
You've got a hand up?

761
01:05:27,801 --> 01:05:31,600
Yeah.

762
01:05:40,641 --> 01:05:42,641
No, well, no, not really.

763
01:05:42,641 --> 01:05:43,440
I have to tell you.

764
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,841
I mean, you just have to sort of make it up.

765
01:05:45,841 --> 01:05:49,921
What's happened is Smerzhikov has done something.

766
01:05:49,921 --> 01:05:52,320
Old Karamatsov is dead.

767
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:58,400
Ivan ought to be there congratulating him on his part in it, whatever it was.

768
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,801
And Yvonne has been avoiding Smerzhikov.

769
01:06:00,801 --> 01:06:03,200
So he's, so to speak, unplugged.

770
01:06:04,481 --> 01:06:15,360
And that expresses itself, as it often does in Dostoevsky, by him being weak and thin and as if ill.

771
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:17,120
He's just lost.

772
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:20,881
He's lost his motivations because Yvonne hasn't been around.

773
01:06:20,881 --> 01:06:21,600
Yeah.

774
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:25,761
Yes.

775
01:06:25,761 --> 01:06:26,801
Exactly.

776
01:06:26,801 --> 01:06:31,760
And he's been unplugged from the host, and he's a dying parasite.

777
01:06:31,761 --> 01:06:35,600
But luckily for him, he's about to get plugged in again.

778
01:06:35,601 --> 01:06:41,120
And that's why in the second interview, I'm jumping ahead, but in the second interview, he'll be full of Pep again.

779
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:47,280
But right now he's almost on 570.

780
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:51,040
He's almost dying at the 570, the bottom.

781
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:57,761
Smerzhikov, who was ill, almost dying, had been with him ever since Fedor Karamazov's murder.

782
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,680
With them, namely with Mario, the neighbor who's taking care of him.

783
01:07:01,681 --> 01:07:08,080
But he's so unplugged, he's a parasite without a host, that he's just about gone.

784
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:13,560
But he's saved, so to speak, by Yvonne going to talk to him finally.

785
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:24,040
And by the way, his loving somebody, some sort of loving, is what he says to Yvonne in the middle of 576.

786
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:26,200
It was through my complicity.

787
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:30,761
I never have shammed a fit in my life, but I only said so then to boast to you.

788
01:07:30,761 --> 01:07:32,360
It was just foolishness.

789
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:33,961
I loved you so much then.

790
01:07:33,961 --> 01:07:35,881
Loved is what the other translation says.

791
01:07:35,881 --> 01:07:37,881
Liked must be too weak.

792
01:07:37,881 --> 01:07:41,801
I loved you so much then and was open-hearted with you.

793
01:07:41,801 --> 01:07:58,280
So we're getting him telling Yvonne that he could sham a fit and was ready to do it and did it in order for Dimitri to come in and commit the murder.

794
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:03,320
And what Yvonne says as he leaves, at the bottom of 576, is goodbye.

795
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:07,801
I won't say anything of your being able to sham a fit, and I don't advise you to either.

796
01:08:07,801 --> 01:08:10,680
Something made Yvonne say suddenly.

797
01:08:10,681 --> 01:08:17,320
He's always saying these things impulsively that he shouldn't say, like, I'm going to leave for Moscow, he says, and he doesn't know why he said it.

798
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:27,720
That's because he's this weird split character who's got this dark side that he doesn't recognize, and this dark side sort of does things that he doesn't recognize or control.

799
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:31,160
It's like, and it occurs to me, Dr.

800
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:39,320
Strangelove, when he's having this business of saluting and saying Heil Hitler, when he's supposed to be on the other side, and he's just split like that.

801
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:42,520
He's got this double commitment.

802
01:08:42,841 --> 01:08:53,400
So now it turns out, and Yvonne says to him, in effect, I know what you're up to, and I, in effect, affirm it.

803
01:08:53,721 --> 01:08:55,240
We're in this together.

804
01:08:55,240 --> 01:09:00,160
And I'm not going to tell anybody, and you better not tell anybody, that you could sham a fit.

805
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:02,000
Okay, now what do you expect?

806
01:08:57,801 --> 01:09:03,520
I gave it away already.

807
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:16,881
Having said that at the end of the first interview, how do you expect him to be, how do you expect Smerzhikov to be well or sick in the second interview?

808
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,080
Well, right.

809
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,801
He's now reconnected with Yvonne.

810
01:09:22,801 --> 01:09:32,961
They've admitted, Yvonne has admitted they have this secret deal, admitted it without noticing or sort of impulsively and sort of unconsciously admitted it.

811
01:09:32,961 --> 01:09:46,560
So when he gets back, second interview on 579, he notices immediately that Smerzhikov is now in good shape at this third paragraph of that section 7.

812
01:09:46,561 --> 01:09:50,320
Ivan saw at once that Smerzhikov was completely recovered from his illness.

813
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,681
His face was fresher, fuller.

814
01:09:51,681 --> 01:09:55,360
His hair stood up jauntily in front and was plastered down at the side.

815
01:09:55,360 --> 01:10:00,961
And he was sitting in a wadded dressing gown, rather dirty and frayed.

816
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,641
Now comes this typical neat little move for Dostoevsky.

817
01:10:04,641 --> 01:10:08,480
He was wearing glasses, which Yvonne had never seen him wearing before.

818
01:10:08,481 --> 01:10:11,841
This trifling thing suddenly redoubled Yvonne's anger.

819
01:10:11,841 --> 01:10:14,160
A creature like that wearing glasses.

820
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,760
What is all that about?

821
01:10:15,761 --> 01:10:22,961
Well, that's a way that he's copying Yvonne and being an intellectual and sort of upper class.

822
01:10:22,961 --> 01:10:36,801
And it's driving Yvonne crazy that this guy is kind of a parody of him wearing glasses just like he does, although he is not an intellectual like he is.

823
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:48,440
So, and now Smerzhikov thinks that he has an understanding with Ivan, and he's full of energy because of that.

824
01:10:48,761 --> 01:10:56,360
So, you see that on 579 at the bottom, all this struck Ivan instantly.

825
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:58,440
He took it all in and noted it at once.

826
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:03,000
Most of all, the look in Smerzhikov's eyes, positively malicious, surly, and haughty.

827
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,120
Why do you want to intrude?

828
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,080
It seemed to say.

829
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:06,841
We've already settled everything.

830
01:11:06,841 --> 01:11:08,520
Why have you come again?

831
01:11:08,521 --> 01:11:24,120
Ivan could scarcely control himself because Ivan can't stand it when Smerzykov accuses Yvonne of having made this deal with him where he's going to scam a fit so that Dmitry can commit the murder.

832
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:30,680
I'm trying to keep to what everybody knows at the point because different things are coming out little by little.

833
01:11:31,641 --> 01:11:35,640
So he's got back his will to live.

834
01:11:35,641 --> 01:11:38,600
And let's see, we're now on 580.

835
01:11:42,681 --> 01:11:45,801
He says to Smerzhikov in the middle of the page, were you threatening me?

836
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:48,040
Am I in some sort of conspiracy with you?

837
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:49,801
That's this secret compact.

838
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:53,480
And he knows he is, but he doesn't want to admit it.

839
01:11:53,481 --> 01:11:58,280
And he doesn't want Smerzhikov to push him to admit it.

840
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:04,280
And Smerzhikov keeps telling him the truth on 581.

841
01:12:04,601 --> 01:12:08,440
As for the murder, you couldn't have done that and didn't want to.

842
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:12,040
But as for wanting somebody else to do it, that is just what you did want.

843
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:13,400
That's crucial.

844
01:12:13,801 --> 01:12:21,881
He knows, Smerzhikov knows, Ivan knows, but doesn't want to admit that he wanted old Taramatsov killed, but he didn't want to do it.

845
01:12:21,881 --> 01:12:24,200
It's like, how responsible are you?

846
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,160
We should stop with this.

847
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:39,520
Think as you read this or reread it of the levels of possible guilt, because it's a kind of amazing story in which all sorts of people are guilty for the death of Karamatsov in all sorts of ways.

848
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:45,360
Let me read you at least four or five kinds of responsibility.

849
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:48,000
You can just desire that he be dead.

850
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:57,440
That's like Dmitry, that he keeps saying how much he loathes him and how much he wishes he was dead and how much he might well do it.

851
01:12:57,761 --> 01:13:02,480
And then there would be getting out of the way and letting it happen.

852
01:13:02,801 --> 01:13:08,560
That's what Ivan did: let Dmitri do it, leave for Moscow.

853
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,000
That's called letting die.

854
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:17,600
If somebody is very sick, you can't kill them, but you can turn off the life support system.

855
01:13:17,601 --> 01:13:20,080
That doesn't count as killing them exactly.

856
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:24,720
It's not a murder, not murder, then, not full-degree, first-degree murder.

857
01:13:24,721 --> 01:13:25,921
That's letting die.

858
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:30,560
So Yvonne is at least responsible for letting die.

859
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,801
And then you could go further.

860
01:13:32,801 --> 01:13:36,240
You could set things up so that the murder would happen.

861
01:13:36,561 --> 01:13:43,440
And that's beginning, and Yvonne seems to be guilty of that too, by making his deal with Smerzhikov.

862
01:13:43,761 --> 01:13:47,680
Then you could put somebody up to it, like hiring a killer.

863
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,921
That would really be first-degree murder.

864
01:13:49,921 --> 01:13:55,280
You go to the mafia and you hire somebody to kill old Karamatsov or whoever.

865
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,560
And then there's actually doing the killing.

866
01:13:58,561 --> 01:14:00,640
Somebody has to do that.

867
01:14:00,641 --> 01:14:08,320
And at this point, Yvonne feels guilty, but only for the letting it happen kind of guilt.

868
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,360
557.

869
01:14:09,841 --> 01:14:14,841
He's upset enough about that.

870
01:14:15,481 --> 01:14:19,080
But that's all he's upset about at this point.

871
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:21,480
Where, where, where?

872
01:14:21,801 --> 01:14:23,400
579.

873
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,480
Hmm, that's not where I want to be.

874
01:14:32,681 --> 01:14:33,961
557.

875
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,881
Okay, here we are.

876
01:14:38,761 --> 01:14:40,600
It isn't around 557.

877
01:14:40,921 --> 01:14:42,120
Okay, I got problems.

878
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,400
557.

879
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,080
Why isn't it there?

880
01:14:45,721 --> 01:14:47,080
I don't know.

881
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,240
But he does feel guilty for letting it happen.

882
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:56,040
Anyway, it's time to stop, luckily, because I'll start there with the right quote.

883
01:14:56,040 --> 01:15:04,200
And now we're ready for the second interview, which we're going to go on and do, and the third interview next time.

884
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:09,240
And try to finish.

885
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:11,320
I really haven't quite given it away yet.

886
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:16,440
So try to finish before I have to give you the whole complicated, true story.
