1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,119
I'm going to start by going back to Breathless because I think I learned something absolutely important, and I hope it's right, and new to me after all these years of teaching Breathless from some people's objections that he really that Michel Poikar is somehow not a Nietzschean free spirit.

2
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,399
And I said, well, of course not.

3
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:24,240
He's a kind of pop-free spirit.

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,399
But he's not even a pop-free spirit.

5
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:32,479
There's something essential about him, about free spirits, I think, that he laughs.

6
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,759
I was just beginning to get a glimmer of that at the end last time, so I'm going to run quickly through it.

7
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,439
We know he's a positive nihilist, and Patricia's a negative one.

8
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,359
I don't change my mind about that.

9
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,240
But there are degrees of positive nihilism.

10
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:58,399
And I want to say now, maybe I'll have to give this up under questioning or after thinking about it more, but I think now he's the lowest form of active or positive nihilist.

11
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,479
And he's, and I'll tell you at the end what the highest form is.

12
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,920
And there's a big difference at the end of this little thing on the breathless.

13
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,799
And there's a big difference.

14
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,079
But let's start with him.

15
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,479
Here's what he has of positive, active nihilism.

16
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,079
He has brief habits.

17
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,079
She is his brief habit.

18
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:23,039
He's ready to risk his life for her, but he's clear that it's not a long-term commitment.

19
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:25,999
He's irreverent about all the old morality.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,560
Everything's sacred and is for him old and weak.

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,239
And he's cheerfully ignoring everything that's been taken seriously and making fun of it.

22
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:49,999
And he understands and enjoys that the answer to the why is lacking and uses it to make up a life story for himself, or many several lives, and use it to make a sort of nihilistic poetry.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:03,079
He lives dangerously, and I hadn't really noticed, but if you look at 228, you have to have the, he fits perfectly into the free spirit.

24
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:10,919
If you go after the live dangerously in 228, I think I even read it, but I didn't really, it didn't soak in.

25
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:19,000
He says, live at war with your peers and yourselves, be robbers and conquerors as long as you cannot be rulers and possessors.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,120
Well, he's a robber.

27
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,159
He's an outlaw.

28
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,439
He's a car stealer.

29
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:29,639
He's one of the people that actually gets listed here as the kind of people who live dangerously.

30
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:36,599
But how does he fall short of being a free spirit, of being, which I take to be the highest kind?

31
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:41,719
See, I used to say in all last lecture, I said he was a free spirit.

32
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,400
I take that back.

33
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:54,919
If you go back over your notes, I would take out every time it says free spirit and put positive nihilist, because he is a positive nihilist, but he's not a free spirit.

34
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,919
Well, what does he lack as a free spirit?

35
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,240
Something absolutely essential.

36
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,319
He's not creative.

37
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:12,519
He's a kind of negative, reactive kind of free spirit who's tearing everything down, making fun of it, but even a positively cheerful way.

38
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:15,639
But he's not contributing new values.

39
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:18,680
He's not opening up new horizons.

40
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:38,680
If you look at that on page 242, you see in aphorism 302 in the fifth line, two sentences that are side by side, one of which characterizes him.

41
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,640
Uh-oh, we're out of valuation forms?

42
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:43,120
That's amazing.

43
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,719
There must be some around.

44
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:45,919
I brought it a whole.

45
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,199
Anybody else without evaluation forms?

46
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,560
Well, that's pretty amazing.

47
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:52,000
We seem to have exactly the right.

48
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:54,000
Okay, spread them around.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,360
I'm going back to where I am.

50
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,480
Two sentences.

51
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:06,479
He says, Nietzsche says, a strong, bold, audacious soul to go through life with a calm eye and a firm step, always prepared to risk all.

52
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,680
That fits him.

53
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,959
That's okay.

54
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,840
That's already to be a positive nihilist.

55
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:20,560
And then he says the next sentence, impelled by the longing for undiscovered worlds, fees, people, and gods.

56
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,199
Now, you just don't find that in him.

57
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:30,959
I don't find him looking for other worlds, people, suns, fees, gods at all.

58
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:37,920
He's perfectly happy just cheerfully making fun of the ones that are left over from the previous age.

59
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:43,519
So that's the sense in which he lacks the energy and strength, I think, to go all the way.

60
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,240
The free spirit goes all the way.

61
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,399
He not only gets rid of this world, he opens new horizons, new perspectives.

62
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:59,920
Just again, these news, new suns, new worlds, new eyes, new gods, and now even new values.

63
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,920
So now I want to say a word about new values.

64
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,840
But before I do, I think I stop a minute.

65
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:23,920
Do you think I have mischaracterized him, given him too much credit as a positive nihilist or too little credit as the lowest form of the positive nihilist far from a free spirit, which is what I now think you were sensitive to, some of you, when you wanted to complain that he didn't really seem quite as the free spirit I was making him out to be.

66
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:31,560
I I'm pretty satisfied with this, and so I'm not going to stop long unless anybody has strong protests or comments.

67
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm going on to the next point.

68
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,720
There's so many.

69
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:40,360
So, on this list of new, the most important new is new values.

70
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,800
That's something really special that only the most free spirit can do.

71
00:05:45,800 --> 00:06:02,279
Maybe something even higher than a free spirit, which Nietzsche calls in another book of his, the book Thus Spake Zarathustra, there are overmen, Ãœber mentioned, literally supermen, and they invent new values.

72
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:08,120
So, I haven't said much about that, and it's a little late to say much, but I'm going to have to say something because it's important.

73
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:16,519
At the bottom of 265, he talks about, very bottom, the creation of our own new table of what is good.

74
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:22,279
And that means, again, sometimes he calls it creating new values.

75
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:29,160
And now he says, let us, we, where, do I say, does he say new values in this quote?

76
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:31,399
No, but in other quotes.

77
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,879
So now, what is it to create new values?

78
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:39,080
Well, it's not just to change values.

79
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:49,079
The last time I talked about this, I said, well, he goes from certain Christian values to values of overcoming.

80
00:06:49,639 --> 00:07:00,279
That is, he substitutes life values for what he thinks of life-denying values or sort of strong, energetic, for weak ones.

81
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:04,040
But I now think there's something much deeper and important, too.

82
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:10,040
So he doesn't just substitute new values, he changes what it means to be a value.

83
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,759
Up to now, values were our fixed.

84
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,400
They're true.

85
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:26,560
So if they really are values, then they're values for everybody, everywhere, and they're not local, and they're not changeable.

86
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,039
The very notion of a value is like ethics.

87
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,560
It's universal.

88
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,680
Well, he's got a new kind of value, which is changeable.

89
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,360
You can create new values and change values and are not objective, they're subjective.

90
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,120
Everybody can create their own values, the values that they like.

91
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:54,560
Remember, that's what he likes about polytheism: that everybody creates their own gods, and in effect, that is also like creating their own values.

92
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,800
We can change the values at will.

93
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,479
That's a new idea.

94
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,560
That's a very radical idea.

95
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:07,840
And at the same time, we can change what it is to be a human being at will.

96
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,319
That's also on 266.

97
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:19,199
We want to become those we are, human beings who are new, unique, incomparable, who give themselves laws, who create themselves.

98
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:29,920
So the two things, or maybe three things, if you want to put it, I don't know how many, how to count them, that Michel Poitard lacks is he doesn't open new horizons and new worlds.

99
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,720
He doesn't change values and change even what it is to be a value.

100
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:41,199
And he doesn't create new human beings, change what it is, our understanding of what it is to be a human being.

101
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,040
Those are big deal things.

102
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,879
Only the free spirit does that.

103
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:47,680
And maybe only the overman does that.

104
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:54,959
I don't know myself how the how to distinguish them, but that's my guess that that's how you distinguish them.

105
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:01,159
That the overman finally is the one who posits new values and new understandings of what it is to be a human being.

106
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:09,160
That's the most radical kind of life you can have, presumably the most fulfilling.

107
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:14,680
And I want to say one more thing about that, and I wouldn't want to say that that was just plain cheerful.

108
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:19,320
Cheerful seems to me to go with this minimal kind of free spirit.

109
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:29,480
I mean, there's no doubt Michel Poicard is cheerful, and we keep hearing about cheerful, but this isn't, this book isn't called a cheerful wisdom.

110
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,720
It's called The Joyful Wisdom.

111
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,879
I'm sure, I haven't really had time to look it up.

112
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,280
I thought I had the German when I looked.

113
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,399
It's gone.

114
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:47,320
Anyway, I think the joyfulness goes with being this top kind of free spirit, when you're opening new worlds.

115
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,320
And that's when wonder comes in.

116
00:09:49,319 --> 00:09:53,800
I don't think there's much wonder, or any maybe, in Michel Poicard.

117
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:59,400
The nearest he comes to wonder is saying, look at the Place de la Concorde at night, isn't it beautiful?

118
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:11,160
And so he's cheerful and he likes, appreciates lots of things in the world, beautiful things, opposed to her who thinks the only beautiful thing is herself in the mirror and looking like Renoir and so forth.

119
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:15,720
He's open to all sorts of beautiful things, but I don't think he's joyful.

120
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:29,879
And I don't think that he lives in a wonder world where things are so amazing because they're new, really new.

121
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,080
Okay, that's all I have to say about the movie.

122
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,399
I don't really want to go back to discuss it.

123
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:42,120
I just wanted to sort of set the record straight about it from what I said for the last, I don't know, 30 years.

124
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,000
I think I've been wrong.

125
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,759
Who's the one who pushed me on this?

126
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:52,639
Somebody ought to get credit for making a fuss about him not really being seeming like a free spirit.

127
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,680
Was it you, Beatrice?

128
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,320
Sort of.

129
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,240
Oh, well, you go down in history for having fixed it.

130
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,400
Okay, now, here we go.

131
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,200
Next.

132
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,960
So now we're going to go through for the rest of the time.

133
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:16,000
I want to sort of carry on a debate between Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, and Nietzsche, sort of asking, in effect, well, who's right?

134
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,680
Who should we believe?

135
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:20,399
Whose way of acting should we strive for?

136
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,760
So forth.

137
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,600
And I've just got a whole lot of comments to make, really, and how they relate to each other.

138
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,480
So let's, and there's no sort of, I'm afraid there's no sort of special order in this.

139
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,000
There's not like an outline.

140
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,439
They could be in any order.

141
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,319
But here it comes.

142
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:42,080
So, one, Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky both value unconditional commitments.

143
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,639
They both remember want an experience of eternity in time.

144
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,960
Whereas what does Nietzsche think?

145
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:55,840
He thinks that that's weak, that if you're strong, you will get over all such.

146
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,879
And I had in my notes that we should get over all sorts of commitments.

147
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:03,360
But that's too much like ethics.

148
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,520
There's nothing in the universe that tells us what we should do.

149
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,160
That's part of the realization of nihilism.

150
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,200
The universe is just a kind of chaos.

151
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,200
But then, what is he, what's his argument if it isn't the what we should do?

152
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:33,879
Well, it's that you, if you're strong and you will outgrow and get over your commitments and your convictions, and you'll keep getting over them as you get stronger and healthier.

153
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:40,360
If you insist on holding on to your commitments, that shows that you're weak and sick.

154
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,720
Nobody says you shouldn't be weak and sick, but it just built in.

155
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,720
Nobody wants to be weak and sick if they can be strong and healthy.

156
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,800
That's the ethics get smuggled into the story about we are that that's how life works.

157
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:58,840
Remember on 100, I'll just read that he says, What is life?

158
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:03,400
It's continually shedding something that wants to die.

159
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:15,799
Life is being cruel and inexorable against everything that is growing old and weak, and not only about us, meaning everything in the culture and everybody who is old and weak.

160
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,600
You should just be tough on them.

161
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,600
It's for their own good they should be stamped out.

162
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:32,279
Or as he says on page 127 of the twilight of the idols, what is good?

163
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:38,039
All that heightens the feeling of power, will to power, power itself in man.

164
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:38,680
What is bad?

165
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:40,680
What proceeds from weakness?

166
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,879
What is happiness?

167
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:45,960
The feeling that power increases, that resistance is overcome.

168
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:50,840
Somebody should really look up joy, happiness, and cheerfulness.

169
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,560
Who knows about it?

170
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,879
No, but my German can tell me.

171
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,000
Help me.

172
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,000
I want to know the difference of the German words.

173
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:02,840
For Iliche Wissenbau, that's the joy.

174
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,399
Hydra is probably cheerful.

175
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:10,360
I don't know what the feeling of, where is it, happiness is.

176
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:11,879
But it's interesting.

177
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,399
You have aha.

178
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,800
Well, I bet those are the words behind this.

179
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:18,879
And you just have to have a feeling for these words.

180
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:25,760
I mean, joyful is the most extreme, cheerful is the least, and happiness is somewhere in between, I think.

181
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:33,520
And I bet if you followed it through, you'd discover interesting things about which of these words he uses at which points.

182
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,400
You're looking worried.

183
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,560
More German consultants, yes.

184
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,080
He just says at the bottom of 127: what is happiness?

185
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,400
The feeling that power increases, that a resistance is overcome.

186
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,640
But without the German, we don't know.

187
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,839
I mean, Kaufman's a very careful translator.

188
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,360
I suspect if he uses three different words, there are three different words.

189
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,279
And we've got a sort of feel for them in English.

190
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:03,040
I just don't want to make a fool of myself and make a fuss about a distinction and then discover that it's the same word.

191
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,320
So I want to check it.

192
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,879
Okay, let me go on here.

193
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,719
So, and remember, even life has to be constantly overcome.

194
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,400
That's what life is.

195
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,800
Even stability and survival are already decay.

196
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:26,000
Nietzsche wrote against Darwin, who thought that what goes on in life is survival of the fittest.

197
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,600
He said, no, that was wrong.

198
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,560
The really fit ones don't just survive.

199
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,920
They outgrow.

200
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:34,160
And that's his view.

201
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:36,879
Now, and then back to the Christians.

202
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:49,600
Well, if they make such a fuss about eternity and time, Kierkegaard says, that must be because they are thick and life-denying and not strong enough to outgrow.

203
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,600
And they want to stabilize what they got.

204
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:02,120
And that, and he's clear that any sort of unconditional commitment or conviction shows weakness.

205
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,720
He talks about that in Twilight on 184.

206
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:18,120
He says, oh yeah, the need for belief, some unconditional yes and no, if I may excuse the expression, is a requirement of weakness.

207
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,120
The man of faith is a dependent man and so forth.

208
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,400
He is not strong enough to posit his own ends.

209
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:37,160
Okay, so when you find something as firm as the vault of heaven, remember that's what Alyasha experiences when he falls on the ground having that religious experience.

210
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:43,560
If you're so happy that you found something as unchanging as the vault of heaven, what does that show?

211
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:52,760
Not that you're in touch with a super mystical experience, but that you're just not strong enough yet to go on your own.

212
00:16:54,279 --> 00:17:19,880
On page 287, he says, believers and their need to believe, how much one needs, how much one needs a faith in order to flourish, how much that is firm, that's as firm as the vault of heaven, how much that is firm, and that one does not wish to be shaken because one clings to it, that is the measure of the degree of one's strength, or to put it more clearly, one's weakness.

213
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:34,200
That's a complicated sentence, but it says, the more you need something firm that you can cling to in your life, right in an eternal memory whose meaning is safe from all change, that shows how weak you are.

214
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:40,600
Convictions are important, he says, and they're necessary, because nobody starts out strong.

215
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:43,359
You have to grow and get strong.

216
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:44,879
But you shouldn't hang on to them.

217
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,320
You should outgrow convictions.

218
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:47,599
You should outgrow them.

219
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,559
Otherwise, they become prisons and they stop your growth.

220
00:17:52,559 --> 00:18:01,679
He says that on 184, too, that convictions are prisons, which is way, way different than Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky.

221
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:09,119
And now, I'm repeating all this because it's going to turn out to be important in what I want to say at the end.

222
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,040
It's all sort of the same point over and over from different angles.

223
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:15,519
When you're strong enough, what happens?

224
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:30,159
Well, you shed your old skin, or like a living thing, or you don't need anymore the beliefs and the experiences that you did before, so you leave them behind.

225
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,200
That's what he's talking about on 245.

226
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:36,640
This is an interesting one, and I love the way he writes it.

227
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:44,639
This is about how your beliefs grow out of your weakness, not out of your rationality.

228
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:51,919
And when you get strong enough to shed these beliefs, you shed them not because you've seen through them and seen that they're irrational.

229
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,079
They always are and always were.

230
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,480
It's because you're strong enough to live without them.

231
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,240
Here it is: a meat quote, the bottom 245.

232
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,399
Now, something that you formerly loved as a truth strikes you as an error.

233
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,639
You shed it and fancy that this represents a victory for your reason.

234
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:17,279
But perhaps this error was as necessary for you then, when you were still a different person.

235
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:20,000
You're always a different person.

236
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:31,319
As necessary for you then, as are all your present truths, being a skin, as it were, that covers a great deal that you're not prepared to see.

237
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:35,559
What killed that opinion for you was your new life and not your reason.

238
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:37,319
You no longer need it.

239
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:43,399
And now it collapses, and unreason crawls out of it into the light like a worm.

240
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:49,399
That amazing, he's a great German writer, the greatest German stylist, I guess, maybe there is.

241
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:56,919
So when we, and then the next sentence, when we criticize something, this is no arbitrary, impersonal event.

242
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:04,279
It is at least very often evidence of vital energies in us that are growing and shedding a skin.

243
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:06,679
That is the, I'll come back at the end to that.

244
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:16,200
What follows from this, of course, is that the reasons for what you believe, or reasons for what you don't believe, are really irrelevant.

245
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:24,919
They're simply, or to put it another way, they're relative to your weaknesses, valuable, they're symptoms, not reasons.

246
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:33,720
Once you're strong enough to see through it, any error you have, which you need, you can get over and then you can shed.

247
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:44,839
So what would Nietzsche say to Dostoevsky, just to put it in a funny, unfortunate way, because I am a big Dostoevsky fan, but I'm trying to think like Nietzsche next.

248
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,680
Well, he would say to Dostoevsky, why in the world would you hold on to a childhood memory all your life?

249
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,599
That just shows that you're weak.

250
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:57,799
If you don't outgrow and reinterpret your childhood memories, you just haven't grown up.

251
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:02,599
What's so important about a pound of nuts or being held up to an icon?

252
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:20,480
I mean, sure, it shows that you were loved at that point, and that's something sort of important, but now you're a different person, and the fact that you were loved way back then by your mother or befriended by a German doctor is no longer what you need and what you should be thinking about.

253
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:29,839
And if you should be open, for instance, to act in the appropriate way, that is the most powerful way in the current situation.

254
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:38,079
And that may mean holding on to these memories and letting them tell you what you can't laugh at, which is what Dostoevsky thinks.

255
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:48,480
And it may mean laughing at these memories and becoming ironic about your childhood and going on to some different understanding of who you are that increases your power.

256
00:21:48,480 --> 00:22:06,319
The only point, the only real issue in the end is how strong, how healthy, how much you can overcome, how much power you've got, and childhood memories are, you know, probably not going to do it, but they're going to drag you down.

257
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,639
That's what he thinks.

258
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,399
Now, the question is then, we're going to go on now.

259
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,359
Well, now I don't want to just keep going on.

260
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:24,399
That's the first big confrontation over eternity and in time and whether it's a good thing or a bad thing.

261
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,119
One way to put it is: remember, I've said this before, but I should say it again.

262
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:56,639
Whereas Dostoevsky and Kierkegaard think that the truth of Christianity can be captured in this existentialized way where you don't need a supreme being anymore, but you have some experiences which capture what the importance to you as a human being is of what once upon a time was put in this magical, metaphysical way.

263
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:08,039
So there isn't any such thing as eternity outside time, and neither Kierkegaard nor Dostoevsky nor Nietzsche believe there is.

264
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:13,880
And then, but Nietzsche, sorry, Dostoevsky and Kierkegaard believe there is eternity in time.

265
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:21,240
That's this defining commitment story or this vault of heaven connected story.

266
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:29,559
And they have, so they're saving what they think is the truth of Christianity by existentializing it.

267
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:48,679
They're the two most important Christian thinkers of the 20th century for us now because they managed to preserve it even though, even in the face of our not believing in this magical metaphysical, some of us not believing in that anyway, fewer and fewer people believing in that.

268
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,960
But then Nietzsche's, remember, one step radical.

269
00:23:51,960 --> 00:24:12,519
He wants to get rid of even of the existentialized, supposedly deep understanding that the original Christian community had before it got even metaphysicalized by the Greeks or was just magical because it would magic because it was primitive culture.

270
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:27,240
And he wants to Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky want to capture the deep truth that Christians had at the beginning and bring it back so they can change the world with it.

271
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,519
And Nietzsche says, no, it was sick from the start.

272
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:34,359
Even what you think is the saving thing was still sick.

273
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:38,200
Only, remember, oh, the only good Christian died on the cross.

274
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:44,480
Jesus was a free spirit, that nobody, that Paul killed it, nobody after that was.

275
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,240
Oh, yeah, that's very interesting.

276
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:47,759
How come you're asking it in that language?

277
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:48,559
That's my language.

278
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,079
Where did you get that talk?

279
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:51,359
Did I say that ever?

280
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,519
I've said that in lecture.

281
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:54,079
Oh, really?

282
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:56,319
Okay, that's a very important idea.

283
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,000
I got it from sort of the margins of Heidegger, where I get everything.

284
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,399
But Heidegger doesn't make such a fuss about it.

285
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:17,919
But he does talk about, Heidegger does, taking up something from your past and bringing it into the present and giving it a new meaning so that it can make the present meaningful to you.

286
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,040
And that's what Dostoevsky and Kierkegaard are doing.

287
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:33,759
They're taking up these Christian practices and making a new and bringing them from the margin to the center of our understanding of Christianity, and they want to put it in the center of our culture.

288
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:40,159
And they want to put Christianity back in the center of our culture, but with this new understanding of it.

289
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:45,839
And Nietzsche talks in another place about the leap from the wings to center stage.

290
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:47,599
I mean, that's the same idea.

291
00:25:47,599 --> 00:26:00,319
That is, something that was already there, understood, sort of, gets taken from the margins where it's sometimes understood and sometimes practiced and made the central thing.

292
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:02,400
And that's what they're trying to do.

293
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,919
Did that help?

294
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,480
Ah, well, okay.

295
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,880
Because if you do it, you change the, when you take something, good way to put it, very good.

296
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:19,839
Yes, what happens when you take something from the margin and to and make it central, and central and make it margin?

297
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:23,359
I may have told you this already, I'm sure I have, but I'll remind you.

298
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:37,160
The most important switch that opened a new world, gave everybody new values, is Jesus' switch from what from the law to the heart, or the or a purity issue.

299
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:45,000
Remember the story that Jesus says that he who commits adulter who he who lusts after a woman in his heart commits adultery.

300
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,119
That's a minor that's one of the ten commandments that you shouldn't commit adultery.

301
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:55,879
But all the rest of the commandments are against things that you do, not how you feel.

302
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:58,839
It's nobody's business whether you lust after your neighbor.

303
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:00,040
It isn't hurting anybody.

304
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:04,519
And moreover, it's terrible because you can't control it.

305
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:08,599
And the more you try not to lust after your neighbor, the more you will.

306
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:12,919
And this is and now what happens when you make a little change like that?

307
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:22,279
A marginal concern, one out of ten, and make it the only important concern, not adultery, but your desires.

308
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:26,679
Instead of what you do, you're defined by what you desire.

309
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,119
And when you make that switch, everything changes.

310
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:42,679
You can't save yourself by your own willpower the way you can for the Jews because the Hebrews understood that what you did, it was only what you did against the law that was wrong.

311
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:47,000
And you can stop doing whatever you're doing against the law that's against the law.

312
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:57,399
But if you make people's desires what makes them good and saved and they or damn, then you have to have a Savior who comes in and helps you.

313
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,000
There's no and and Jesus then beget gets to be the Savior.

314
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,400
So you just so there you are, making a marginal change, but it's changed the whole values.

315
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:13,519
It's changed the system, it's changed the world, and lo and behold, you've got the the Christian world instead of the pagan world or the Hebrew world.

316
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,439
Okay, that's good.

317
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:17,519
Make me review and explain that.

318
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:29,519
Okay, now I'm taking up the next point, and that is two opposed views about another issue and whom should we believe.

319
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:34,720
And that is there's some two opposed views, or three.

320
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,120
No, why do I say two?

321
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,000
Well, maybe.

322
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,960
Let's see what happens.

323
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:46,559
Anyway, I'm going to say what they have in common, Nietzsche and Dostoevsky, and where they differ.

324
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:56,960
Just like I tried to say already, what they do, how they have what they have in common with Christianity, Dostoevsky and Kierkegaard, and how that differs from Nietzsche.

325
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,679
Now we're going to look at what Dostoevsky and Nietzsche share.

326
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,159
So, in fact, they share it with Kierkegaard, too.

327
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,759
I don't know why I don't have him on here.

328
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:06,960
So, what is it?

329
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:18,800
Well, they have the anti-Platonism in Christianity and in the whole view we have how truth is important and universal ethics is important.

330
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:37,359
The things I wrote on the board the very first day of the course, that ethics is universal and it's rational, and everybody should have the same ethical principles, that truth is true for everybody at all times, and there is truth, and we can work at finding it out.

331
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,959
That's all Platonism, and they all d deny that.

332
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,639
And they deny the latest version of it.

333
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,159
And that's important.

334
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:51,919
They deny, and this is a new thing I haven't talked about, they're against the Enlightenment.

335
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,759
The Enlightenment is us.

336
00:29:53,759 --> 00:30:31,720
The Enlightenment is what starts with Descartes in 1650, and then it gets where we become the center of the world instead of God, but it doesn't get fully understood until Kant, when Kant puts us and our rationality in charge and says that, I mentioned this, human beings in the West anyway, in Europe anyway, become mature when they understand that they're the ones who are in charge of their lives and they have a rationality, they can understand what's right and what's true and live by it.

337
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:35,159
But that has all sorts of implications.

338
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:41,960
Then you'll recognize that it's us when I read you what Nietzsche is against.

339
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:44,279
And Dostoevsky would say so too.

340
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:48,200
Remember, Dostoevsky thinks bad things are going on in France and Germany.

341
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,319
In general, you don't see it in the brothers, but he thinks Germans are stupid and dense.

342
00:30:53,720 --> 00:31:03,079
He thinks the French are dangerous because they are believers in this sort of last stage of Greek thinking.

343
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:04,360
So here's Nietzsche.

344
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:10,279
Among Europeans today, there is no lack of those who are entitled to call themselves homeless.

345
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:12,039
Okay, oh no, that's him.

346
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:14,279
Those are the people who live in the gay science.

347
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:16,439
But let me skip to the where.

348
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:17,320
Okay, yes.

349
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:17,799
Here's now.

350
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:21,720
Here are these new people, the free spirits.

351
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,160
We can serve nothing.

352
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,919
Neither do we want to return to any past periods.

353
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,480
We are not by any means liberal.

354
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,319
We do not work for progress.

355
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:35,160
If you just, you could hear this, you could just check off all the things that we believe in.

356
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:40,519
We do not need to plug up our ears against the sirens who in the marketplace sing of the future.

357
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:42,720
Their song of equal rights.

358
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:45,040
This is what we don't believe in.

359
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,879
A free society.

360
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,159
That there will be no more masters and no servants.

361
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,240
All that has no allure for us.

362
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:59,919
We simply do not consider it desirable that a realm of justice and concord should be established on earth.

363
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,240
Well, that is pretty amazing.

364
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,439
I mean, that's, so Nietzsche is always very, very far out and very clear.

365
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:16,799
I mean, that really questions all of the things we believe in and care about and vote for people who promise to help us achieve it.

366
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:39,839
And so, and Kierkegaard, they're all sort of, if they have any views at all, anti-democratic, because they think that's just for the masses, then they're all worrying about the individual and their own free understanding and thing.

367
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:41,519
Yes, they want.

368
00:32:42,480 --> 00:33:02,639
They promote this progress by which the West has gradually understood more and more how to make individuals free, how to bring about justice, that there should be progress, and it all happens by reason, which is the way Kant and Descartes said it would.

369
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,720
And that's what Nietzsche claims is coming to an end, that the free spirits don't believe in that anymore.

370
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,880
They are the wave of the future.

371
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,680
And the wave of the future is not progress.

372
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:19,919
It's cataclysmic disaster to begin with.

373
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,040
And after that, hard to understand what it is.

374
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:27,360
A lot of overmen are free spirits, seemingly sort of wandering around on their own.

375
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:38,440
They don't have much of a positive story, what should replace the values that they but they don't but they don't think that there's any hope to save these values.

376
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:45,720
I mean, God is dead, and God is what supported all this belief in progress and whatever else I had was on that list.

377
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,319
So, and therefore, all that is going to collapse, they think.

378
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,480
And they think it's good news.

379
00:33:51,480 --> 00:34:15,880
So, there's Yvonne's geological cataclysm, which where the devil talks about how all of the current culture is going to destroy itself and that we will have this new man who is boy, this is, I just realized how funny this is.

380
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,039
Well, I think this is what you'd expect.

381
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:34,440
I mean, in a certain way, remember, or you don't remember, but you've got to think that Dostoevsky is against the new man that's going to come after the cataclysm.

382
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:51,960
Because the new man that's going to come after the cataclysm is going to be, and this is where it gets hard to follow because it's, but it's right, that the new man, from a Dostoevsky point of view, is still part of the Enlightenment.

383
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:53,960
That's the tricky part.

384
00:34:53,960 --> 00:35:06,600
I mean, Dostoevsky would say, but Nietzsche thinks that we should be free and we should be self-egoist and that we should give our own life meaning and so forth.

385
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:13,759
And that we shouldn't be have any higher authority in our life.

386
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,879
That's weakness.

387
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:20,079
I can't just switch to that passage, but that's tied up with we should become gods ourselves.

388
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:26,320
And I could lose you if I'm not careful because I am not saying this as clearly as I should.

389
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:29,440
So Nietzsche is against the Enlightenment.

390
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,760
And this is what I just read you.

391
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,080
I'm going to go back and read the beginning.

392
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:42,800
There's a kind of interesting sort of game being played at this point, which is who's more enlightenment than whom?

393
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,280
And is that a good thing or a bad thing?

394
00:35:45,280 --> 00:36:00,240
That is, Nietzsche is against progress and justice and equal rights and each person being a free society.

395
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:14,480
Nietzsche is against it in the name of the fact that there'll be new gods, each one of them sort of ruthlessly and egotistically pursuing his own outgrowing and so forth.

396
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,160
And now is what I have to think clearly.

397
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:26,880
So Nietzsche thinks that he is going to go against the Enlightenment.

398
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:29,199
And Dostoevsky is also against.

399
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:46,000
And Dostoevsky is against the Enlightenment because it's lost touch with the receptive religious experience of finding a higher authority in your life than your own will.

400
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:54,160
And he, therefore, that's what he's defending when you, when Alyasha experiences the love and connectedness of everything.

401
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:56,559
That's not human freedom.

402
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:09,720
That's not progress in the sense that in the Enlightenment, let me remember, remember the difference between Christian socialism and the Grand Inquisitor.

403
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:25,400
Dostoevsky thinks the only kind of politics you can have is that you have to be Christian first and receive the love connection.

404
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:42,039
Whereas Dostoevsky is against the Enlightenment, our way of thinking, our Western European way of thinking, in the name of his Christian way of thinking.

405
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:52,840
The Enlightenment is a secular way that people are going to supposedly all become free and get progress and get rid of all the evil in the world.

406
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,600
Kierkegaard thinks that's impossible.

407
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:09,960
You can't, the kind of overman, the kind of free spirit that you're going to get is going to be just dangerous and destructive because they won't be in touch with the love of everything.

408
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,399
So now comes the tricky part to think about it.

409
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:18,200
So from Kierkegaard's point of view, the Enlightenment's a bad thing.

410
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:33,400
And from Nietzsche's point of view, the Enlightenment's a bad thing, because the Enlightenment doesn't give enough emphasis to individual free spirits doing their own individual thing.

411
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:38,680
It wants justice, it wants fair progress, and so forth.

412
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:43,000
So they both think the Enlightenment is not a good thing, is a bad thing.

413
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:58,960
But Dostoevsky thinks it's a bad thing for one for this reason that it's not, it's given up the Christian sense of a world outside of our own control and our own power, this love world that we have to get in touch with.

414
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,279
And therefore, now comes the tricky move.

415
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:16,559
Kierkegaard thinks that Nietzsche's way of opposing the Enlightenment, the Greek, the philosophical story, is just more extreme enlightenment.

416
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:21,760
Because, after all, Nietzsche thinks that you don't need Christianity.

417
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:30,080
He doesn't think you need Christianity and he doesn't think you need liberal democracy either.

418
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:37,120
Now, Dostoevsky agrees, I think I'm getting clearer, that with Nietzsche, liberal democracy is not going to do us any good.

419
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,960
They both share that.

420
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,880
But then Nietzsche thinks we'll just go beyond it.

421
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:45,840
Everybody will become like gods.

422
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,679
That's sort of the ultimate beyond the Enlightenment Enlightenment.

423
00:39:49,679 --> 00:40:00,320
They're all totally self-willful, rational, well, not rational, willful, powerful individuals, but it's beyond the Enlightenment.

424
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:10,559
It's after the collapse of the Enlightenment, but it's still the view that each human being doesn't need God anymore.

425
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:12,480
They become God.

426
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,160
Whereas Dostoevsky wants to say something very different.

427
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,759
And now let me try to say it.

428
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,000
There's something, human beings are hopeless.

429
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,960
They are, remember I said the Hobbes' famous phrase, nasty, brutish, and short.

430
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,320
They are they are that is life is natural, nasty, brutish, and short.

431
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:34,679
And the uh, but mainly people are selfish.

432
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,559
That's what the mysterious visitor understood.

433
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:45,320
And the you can't build a world on people.

434
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:52,840
And Nietzsche sort of thinks most people are hopeless and weak and herd-like and so forth, but there'll be some people who will be strong.

435
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,440
It's sort of the Grand Inquisitor-like.

436
00:40:54,440 --> 00:41:05,000
But Dostoevsky wants to say, no, Nietzsche trying to make human beings into gods is just the last stage of a complete misunderstanding.

437
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,839
Human beings can't be gods.

438
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:25,400
They're on their own only by being saved, only by being in touch with the love that Alyasha experiences, that connects all the worlds, and that will be, if Dostoevsky gets it right, spread all over the world when the star rises in the east.

439
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:32,440
Now, so the bottom line is they're both against our kind of values in the Enlightenment.

440
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:41,240
But Dostoevsky thinks Nietzsche is just an extreme form of the kind of values that he's against, that Kierkegaard, that Dostoevsky is against.

441
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:48,360
And so Dostoevsky wants to be against Nietzsche as the last stage of the Enlightenment.

442
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:55,160
Whereas Nietzsche thinks that he's against the Enlightenment because it's not gone far enough.

443
00:41:55,159 --> 00:42:03,960
And that Dostoevsky is the old wrong way that hasn't even understood yet that human beings had to be healthy, have to be independent, and be something.

444
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,239
I shouldn't have ever launched into this.

445
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:06,920
I'm feeling unhappy.

446
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,640
Go ahead.

447
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:17,840
Making this creation of information.

448
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,319
And that's nature's way of participating.

449
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:24,000
So it wouldn't be in a full individual.

450
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
There wouldn't be creating.

451
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:32,320
You wouldn't be following the nature of the creative force by.

452
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:32,879
That's good.

453
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,440
That's good.

454
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:44,480
A stable individual is it would also be like finding your position in nature, because there is no position.

455
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,359
Okay.

456
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:53,519
What you're saying is extremely interesting and complicates something because it's really, this is going to drive you completely crazy.

457
00:42:53,840 --> 00:43:01,519
Because what's happening is where Nietzsche is saying, you should have no authority.

458
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:09,280
You should give the law to yourself and create yourself, create the kind of human being that you want to be, and so forth.

459
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:16,960
But we do that all by being responsive to the way life works, to the creative overcoming in nature.

460
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:37,920
And that means somehow that you have to be, and this is the craziest weird thing to think, receptive to a power that makes it makes that you express in your life by allowing no higher authority over you and the claim that all values are in your power.

461
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,679
So it's a very, in that funny way, paradoxical position.

462
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:43,760
You're bringing out the other side.

463
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,960
I want to leave it.

464
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,959
For those who understood it, good.

465
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,880
If you understand it, come and tell me.

466
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,519
I mean, I got, it's, it's too complicated to try to do anyway.

467
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:54,880
Let me see where I am.

468
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,719
I'll just one way, I sum it up here.

469
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:02,840
Dostoevsky would say that Nietzsche is part of an individualist, willful, enlightenment tradition.

470
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:09,400
And Dostoevsky would say, you have to have the strength and courage to serve something higher than yourself.

471
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,639
And Nietzsche says, it's weakness.

472
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,240
That's the final issue between them.

473
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:20,280
Now let's see if I can skim to where I, because I've done this already in a sort of a way.

474
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,600
And I want to make sure I get to the end.

475
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:24,600
So I'm summing up something here.

476
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:28,760
So both Nietzsche and Dostoevsky think that they're the wave of the future.

477
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:40,680
Dostoevsky expects a new secularized Christianity, that is a new demagicalized, existentialized, Christianized world, and that's the star in the East.

478
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:47,640
Nietzsche expects that now that God is dead and all things are possible, we all become gods ourselves.

479
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:54,199
And so, okay, now, who should we believe, having gotten through all that?

480
00:44:54,519 --> 00:45:02,199
Well, if you try to figure out which one to believe, you just don't know what to think.

481
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,199
I mean, should you serve a higher power?

482
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:05,640
Is there a higher power?

483
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:12,279
Even if there were, would it be weakness and sickness, or would it be the highest strength to get in sync with it, and so forth?

484
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:16,920
Well, at that point, Nietzsche makes an incredibly interesting move.

485
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,120
He changes the whole rules of the debate.

486
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:31,039
He says, don't try to figure this out like a philosophical issue and ask yourself which is the best argument, who has the best description of the phenomena?

487
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:32,440
Who should you believe.

488
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:35,480
It's not a question of belief at all.

489
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,039
It's a question of taste.

490
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:40,039
That is such a strange move.

491
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:41,960
It's an aesthetic question.

492
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,200
Here is what he says on page 106.

493
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:49,039
The change in general taste is more powerful than that of opinions.

494
00:45:49,280 --> 00:46:03,039
Opinions, along with all proofs, refutation, and the whole intellectual masquerade are merely symptoms of the change in taste, and most certainly not what they are still often supposed to be, its causes.

495
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:18,720
So what's happening is it's not what's changing us from Christianity, either, even Christianity of the Dostoevsky or Kierkegaardian thought, from all forms of society up to now.

496
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:26,960
What makes us able to understand that God is dead is that there's a change in taste.

497
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,159
People just don't believe in the religious experiences anymore.

498
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:35,280
They don't admire them anymore.

499
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,440
So Nietzsche says it's not a question of truth.

500
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:53,440
Namely, it's given that the way our culture has developed, we can't continue believing in love, connectedness, morality, and meaning, and we've become strong enough to do without it.

501
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,879
And that's the issue, not whether it was right or wrong.

502
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:02,720
It was right for us when we were weak, and it's wrong for us once we get strong.

503
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:16,320
This is what he's saying on 287, which is, in general, he says, an article of faith can be refuted a thousand times, but before a man, in front of a man, can be refuted a thousand times.

504
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:22,160
If he needs it, he would consider it true again and again in accordance with period.

505
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:31,879
And then he says, well, he says, he's saying again, I don't know if I need to read it, but let's do it because it's got to do with firmness again.

506
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:38,120
He's saying that all this talk about demanding firm things is just the result of weakness at the top of 288.

507
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:42,680
The demand that one wants by all means that something should be firm.

508
00:47:42,679 --> 00:47:53,160
This too is still the demand for a support, a prop, in short, an instinct of weakness, which to be sure does not create religions, but it conserves them.

509
00:47:53,159 --> 00:48:11,880
So all of this is to say that as free spirits, we are outgrowing religion, not because we discover it was wrong and told us something about the world.

510
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,759
It's because we don't need it anymore.

511
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:22,279
At the top of 186, he says, what's now decisive against Christianity is our taste, no longer our reason.

512
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:25,400
That's an amazing thing to say.

513
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,919
Or 340.

514
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:30,920
You feel the really weird thing that Nietzsche is changing the subject.

515
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:41,559
At the middle of 340, he says, we have outgrown Christianity and are adverse to it because we have grown out of it and so forth.

516
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:46,120
Now, he also says, I mean, now that's how it's in here.

517
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:47,559
What does this mean?

518
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:53,480
This means that which one of these views is right isn't the right question.

519
00:48:53,480 --> 00:49:05,800
It's the question of which one of these views is going to be the one that feels right, that we find attractive, that fits our taste in how to live and look at things.

520
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:31,200
And Nietzsche says that by the year, I think it's 1910 or something, I forget where he gets that number, that people will begin to appreciate this, and that will be as the three spirits begin to find the receptive recognition of a higher authority, which has been going on for 2,000 years, no longer acceptable.

521
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:33,039
Now, what follows from this?

522
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:34,959
Well, who's right?

523
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:41,440
The answer becomes: well, who's what is your sensibility about it?

524
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,639
How do you feel about it?

525
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:51,920
So I'm going to take a sort of a poll now, because I do this every year, and you can see that I'm checking whether Nietzsche is right, whether we are outgrowing it or not.

526
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,239
Because that's the only interesting question Nietzsche says.

527
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:56,800
I mean, we're not going to settle any kind of argument.

528
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,320
Is there a web of love and connectedness?

529
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:04,719
Are we in despair, all of us, unless we have an unconditional commitment?

530
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:10,559
Are we all weak unless we can leave all that behind?

531
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,919
You can't settle that.

532
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:15,360
It's important to understand that those are the options.

533
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,960
It's important to understand that those are possible ways of life.

534
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,960
But when you finally come to choose which way of life, I'm afraid philosophy can't help you.

535
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,680
It's going to be a change of taste.

536
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:31,919
It's going to be the way people feel, aesthetics changes.

537
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:55,120
Okay, so what I want to do is take this poll, and I'll tell you, so and we just have time to do, there is a whole bunch, I'm going to give you a bunch of options, which so how many I'm going to ask you how many sensibilities prefer or admire or uh you know uh want to live by the following.

538
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,120
So there's one, the obvious one.

539
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:04,279
The obvious one a good old-fashioned Christian, Judeo-Christian religion.

540
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:16,760
Or better yet, I'm not giving you that option so much, to put it that way, but as it is in the Course, sort of Platonized Judeo-Christian religion.

541
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:30,200
The way Christianity and Judaism has come down to us with the idea of a supreme being, with the idea that we should be in the proper relation to that being and that there's a truth about that being.

542
00:51:30,199 --> 00:51:39,480
In other words, um in a way, who who still holds the the orthodox kind of beliefs that that Nietzsche wants us not to hold?

543
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,679
Let me just count you.

544
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:46,840
Tell me because it's important to so here's I'll tell you also the votes and over the last few years.

545
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,239
On on this on that, there were ten.

546
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:51,799
Of course, you have to see how many people are in the whole class.

547
00:51:52,039 --> 00:51:53,480
You have to see that little by little.

548
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:55,080
Sixteen.

549
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,559
That's where we were for this.

550
00:51:57,559 --> 00:52:04,839
How many here are believers in the in the Orthodox Judeo-Christian sense?

551
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,279
There must be quite a few still.

552
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,839
Okay, let's see.

553
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:11,479
There don't be um it may be right.

554
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,000
I mean, i if there's no right.

555
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,239
If enough of you raise your hand, you will be right.

556
00:52:15,239 --> 00:52:22,199
One, two, three, four, five, six, you, seven, eight, you'll be telling me, it looks like eight.

557
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:27,080
You'll you'll be if you maybe I mean, you are you asking something or voting?

558
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,519
Okay, nine.

559
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:40,519
Then, uh so so if it if everyone had raised their hands, then it would have turned out that Nietzsche is wrong, that our sensibility is not changing, that we have our taste has not turned against it.

560
00:52:40,519 --> 00:52:43,119
But then there's there's a whole other possibility.

561
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:48,719
And that got, well, then there's two sub-parts.

562
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:53,680
There's the unconditional commitment, people, and that's Kierkegaard.

563
00:52:54,639 --> 00:53:00,400
And there's the Dostoevsky connectedness.

564
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,680
I can't tell you ahead of time how it was.

565
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:07,760
So how many believe in the unconditional commitment story?

566
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:09,200
Not so many.

567
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,000
One, one, two, put your hands up high.

568
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,639
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, eight.

569
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:17,840
I'm voting.

570
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,679
I can't count myself, I think, because that wouldn't be fair.

571
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:24,399
So there's seven, nine, and nine.

572
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,079
That's holding a constant.

573
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:37,600
At this point, when I was doing this, my TA, a woman, said, so you all believe in this unconditional commitment.

574
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,199
Wait, no, forget it.

575
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,479
I'm telling you that too soon.

576
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:48,000
So there's the unconditional commitment to all human, to all other beings.

577
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,759
How many of the Dostoevsky?

578
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,039
Ah, wow.

579
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:53,199
Dostoevsky is, I need help.

580
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:54,480
Beatrice, help me count this.

581
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,679
This is fascinating.

582
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:57,200
What do you get?

583
00:53:58,239 --> 00:53:59,919
That's pretty, I got 42.

584
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,199
We'll call it 43.

585
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:01,679
That's pretty.

586
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:06,319
So this has gone, but this has always been a popular one.

587
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,640
Things are sort of staying the same.

588
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:11,120
Okay, then there's the Enlightenment, after all.

589
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:17,440
There's the values of individualism, autonomy, lucidity, social justice, progress.

590
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,079
And how many believe in that?

591
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,360
There ought to be quite a few.

592
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,799
That's what we're supposed to believe in.

593
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:24,159
Yeah.

594
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,199
No, you only can vote once.

595
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:34,519
Although I see why you could, no, if you really push these two views, these views, I think each of them sort of claims to be such that it would let you.

596
00:54:35,079 --> 00:54:38,919
So, how many believe in the Enlightenment project that we're all in?

597
00:54:39,639 --> 00:54:46,600
In progress toward justice and fairness and getting over?

598
00:54:46,599 --> 00:54:48,519
No, no, Dostoevsky wouldn't like that.

599
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:49,639
Dostoevsky did.

600
00:54:49,639 --> 00:54:52,519
I mean, I mean progress, good point.

601
00:54:52,519 --> 00:54:57,720
I don't mean progress by way of love, which is the Dostoevsky story.

602
00:54:57,719 --> 00:54:59,879
Maybe, but I mean the Enlightenment version.

603
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,519
If you get it without love, in fact, you get it by not having it.

604
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:06,119
You don't need a Christian culture.

605
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:07,080
That's the one.

606
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:10,039
Okay, so the secular Enlightenment people.

607
00:55:10,039 --> 00:55:11,880
Now let's see their hands again.

608
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:19,640
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

609
00:55:20,599 --> 00:55:21,079
Okay.

610
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,439
Oh, nine.

611
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:28,920
Okay, so we have the Enlightenment people, and they had before four.

612
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,680
Now they've got eight.

613
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:47,719
And now, of course, where Nietzsche thinks, Nietzsche will only say that he's one if you now, if we get, if constant overcoming is what people's taste has gone towards.

614
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:48,920
So how many Nietzscheans?

615
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,359
How many has Nietzsche convinced?

616
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:58,519
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.

617
00:55:58,519 --> 00:55:59,319
Did I see you?

618
00:55:59,320 --> 00:55:59,959
I don't know.

619
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:02,280
Let's say sixteen.

620
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:07,080
Okay, so, and that, what they had four game, Nietzsche may be losing.

621
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:12,720
It's been, Nietzsche's been steadily gaining until this year.

622
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:15,840
And that's probably true, I think.

623
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,880
Maybe this is not what people sensitivity is for anymore.

624
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:33,599
When I did do the Nietzsche one, which was about danger, struggle, wonder, winning, outgrowing, and healthiness, and so forth, and it got a big boat last time, 60.

625
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:34,799
This is what I was going to tell you.

626
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:41,360
A woman, one of my TAs, said, and would you like, and how many would like their lover to be a Nietzsche?

627
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:45,039
And that reversed the boat completely.

628
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,240
But we're not going to ask that question.

629
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:55,199
So now I have exactly five more minutes before I have to go and let you fill out the evaluation forms.

630
00:56:55,199 --> 00:57:00,000
I want to say something about what existential philosophy is, which you all want me to do.

631
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,159
But I must admit, as I said already, that's not what's important.

632
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:11,280
What's important is each of these thinkers' own way of setting out their whole experience and their whole world.

633
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,600
But there are some things in common.

634
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:18,640
And you start, I think, when you ask a question like that, looking at paradigm cases.

635
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:23,360
What are the most striking versions of existentialist philosophy?

636
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:26,559
Well, I think they're Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, and Nietzsche.

637
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:27,679
That's why we did them.

638
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:29,120
They're the paradigms.

639
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:34,320
But I did leave out two crucial ones: Start and Heidegger.

640
00:57:34,639 --> 00:57:40,880
And, of course, Pascal is in there as the first existential thinker.

641
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,720
But now the question is: what do they all have in common?

642
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:49,360
That's what, in the old Greek way of thinking, is what the essence of something is.

643
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,720
So, what is the essence of existentialism?

644
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:56,719
Well, the most important, I think, is that there's no human nature.

645
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,440
Pascal already says, custom is our nature.

646
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,640
Remember, Nietzsche says that's what makes us different from the animals.

647
00:58:03,639 --> 00:58:05,880
We have no fixed horizons.

648
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,880
We are the undetermined now.

649
00:58:08,199 --> 00:58:10,840
And so that's the first thing.

650
00:58:11,639 --> 00:58:24,200
There are cultures in which there are saints and heroes and saints and sinners and cultures in which there are heroes and villains and probably cultures in which there are devils and enlightened beings and so forth and so forth.

651
00:58:24,199 --> 00:58:28,440
And human beings create what it is to be a human being.

652
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,200
Okay, second point.

653
00:58:30,519 --> 00:58:34,200
And since there's no human nature, we can change it.

654
00:58:34,199 --> 00:58:41,720
And history is not fixed forever any more than human nature is fixed forever.

655
00:58:42,199 --> 00:58:44,280
History isn't outside time.

656
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:51,159
History is the story of these changes, in the West anyway, of these changing understandings of human nature.

657
00:58:51,159 --> 00:58:54,440
That's the story I've been telling.

658
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:59,240
Okay, number three, the individual is higher than the universal.

659
00:58:59,239 --> 00:59:02,280
That sounds familiar if you remember for the first day.

660
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:07,720
That's the Hebraic, Socrates, anti-Plato, anti-Greek.

661
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:16,760
It's Kierkegaard's big deal that the ethical is suspended.

662
00:59:17,079 --> 00:59:21,880
The ethical, which is the universal, is suspended when you have an individual commitment.

663
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:36,199
They all, in some way or another, think that universal ethics is not what is somehow a a not maybe not, most of them think that universal ethics is just going to get in the way of leading a good life.

664
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:37,400
That's pretty extreme.

665
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,519
Kierkegaard thinks that, of course, that the ethical is important.

666
00:59:40,519 --> 00:59:45,200
It makes your life intelligible to you and other people, and that's a good thing.

667
00:59:45,519 --> 01:00:00,240
But in the end, the really, really good thing is somebody like Huck Finn, who can save Jim, even though he thinks that it's the worst thing he could do to not turn in a slave, he won't turn him in.

668
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:08,880
So the individual understanding of what they have to do is higher than the universal principles of what everybody has to do.

669
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,800
That's three, four.

670
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,800
Remember the one on reality.

671
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:20,799
For the Plato, the detached theoretical point of view is how to understand how things really are.

672
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:34,399
But to the existentialists, for all of them, it's from the involved point of view that you find out the truth in Kierkegaard language, and you find it out for yourself or for your time.

673
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,039
There is no truth for everybody everywhere.

674
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:40,000
In Kierkegaard language, truth is subjectivity.

675
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:44,879
That means that in Nietzsche language, it's perspectivism.

676
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,639
I haven't talked about that in Nietzsche.

677
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:53,920
But everybody can have their own truth because they have their own perspective on the world based on their own experience.

678
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,039
And that's what we've been doing.

679
01:00:55,039 --> 01:01:13,759
We've been seeing these various existentialists, each of them with their own perspective based on their own experience, telling you their own truth, which they all understand is not a truth for everybody, but only a truth for those who they can convince to see things their way.

680
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:16,080
Okay, one last one.

681
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:26,320
They are all against the belief in a supreme being in what I call, once writing it on the board, onto theology.

682
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:37,159
Onto theology is the view that there is one supreme creator, God, who is the truth and explains it all and grounds universal atheism.

683
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:44,600
They all think that that kind of God is no longer possible, believable, or necessary.

684
01:01:44,599 --> 01:01:48,280
That they all, in some sense, think we've outgrown that.

685
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,280
They share that with Nietzsche.

686
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:58,600
And they all think that that opens up the possibility of other ways of understanding and relating to the divine and the sacred.

687
01:01:58,599 --> 01:02:05,480
They don't turn out to be just naturalists believing that science tells us all there is to know about human beings.

688
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:11,720
They've all got a place for something very special, namely the sacred.

689
01:02:11,719 --> 01:02:21,960
Whether it's the unconditional command, the calling, in Kierkegaard, a calling without a caller, but you know what you have to do.

690
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:26,039
Or it's the connectedness of all these beings, even though there's no supreme being.

691
01:02:26,039 --> 01:02:29,160
Everything is connected to everything else.

692
01:02:29,159 --> 01:02:37,079
Or it's something in Nietzsche, it's harder to say than he was saying.

693
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:39,480
I mean, it's not the normal sort of sacred.

694
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:43,559
There isn't anything about it that's sacred in that sense.

695
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:47,080
But in Nietzsche, there's still some, how will I put it?

696
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:59,160
That, well, I guess you have to say, since there's no onto theological God in Nietzsche, what you got is not just the sacred, but everybody being a God themselves.

697
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:01,000
But they all share.

698
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,280
There's no one single supreme being in theme.

699
01:03:04,599 --> 01:03:08,679
Now, the one other thing I just want to make one quick plug for Philosophy VI.

700
01:03:08,679 --> 01:03:10,840
I'm going to get Philosophy VI in the fall.

701
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:18,639
If you want to know how we got here, it goes from the Odyssey to Moby Dick.

702
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:23,599
And Moby Dick is the same year Melville, the same year as Kierkegaard.

703
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:26,000
So it's a prequel, in a way, to this one.

704
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:41,920
And once you get it, once you see how the culture gradually lost the sense of the sacred from Homer's gods to Moby Dick, and then sort of got it back again, that's what I want to talk about next time.

705
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:43,679
Okay, now I'm going to run and you're going to.
