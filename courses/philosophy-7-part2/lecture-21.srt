1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
It's probably the most important and interesting episode in the book and the most fun lecture to give.

2
00:00:08,721 --> 00:00:13,200
It's, remember, we had just gotten up to the issue of miracles.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:22,400
And as usual, the well, and sort of, I said this, and I don't want to repeat it except just very briefly.

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:31,361
If Dostoevsky is going to existentialize miracles, then he's got to explain it in terms of human experience.

5
00:00:31,361 --> 00:00:35,201
And it's got to not be, as philosophers like to say, spooky.

6
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:41,840
It's not got to be something that's outside of the, that contravenes the laws of physics and chemistry.

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,680
And yet, it's got to be something that isn't part of the everyday natural world, or it wouldn't be a miracle.

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:01:08,361
So it's pretty hard to figure out whether there's any space in there for something which captures the human, something about human existence, that's why I call it existentialized, captures something about human existence that it makes sense to call a miracle.

9
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,560
And it's something that only Christianity has brought to the world.

10
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,361
And you have to, and now Dostas is going to try to do it.

11
00:01:16,361 --> 00:01:39,161
Now, the other part of the sort of preparation for this is the question left from the Grand Inquisitor, where all of these or most of these existentialized issues are already posed but not answered, is the question: can people live without miracles when there's some big crisis in their lives?

12
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:40,840
That's on 290.

13
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:44,440
You're going to be running around in around 290 from now on.

14
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:54,680
So, this is about two-thirds of the way down, where the Grand Inquisitor says, Is the nature of men such that they can reject miracles?

15
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:03,640
And at the great moments of their lives, the moments of their deepest, most agonizing spiritual difficulties, cling only to the free verdict of the heart?

16
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,000
Well, we're going to find out whether people can.

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:20,440
We're going to find out by looking at somebody who is the best person in the book, namely Adayasha, and see whether he can get along without a miracle when there's a spiritual crisis in his life.

18
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:27,080
And this is already happening on 380.

19
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:40,600
It turns out that Dosama's body is beginning to decompose and to smell bad, and the monks are taking this as a kind of negative miracle.

20
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:48,921
That is, it's a sign that there's something wrong because the body isn't just decomposing normally, but too quickly.

21
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,680
And that's the scandal.

22
00:02:52,161 --> 00:02:57,921
And the question, and the I think I did.

23
00:02:57,921 --> 00:02:59,041
I already talk about this.

24
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:10,320
Did I ask you whether you think after reading it that this is a negative miracle, or is it just a natural thing, as in the middle of 378 the narrator says?

25
00:03:10,801 --> 00:03:13,680
Or is it some kind of positive miracle?

26
00:03:13,921 --> 00:03:22,241
I'll just repeat briefly that there's lots of stuff being written about what it means that Father Zosima's body is decomposed.

27
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:27,680
I mean, there's a lot of gossip in the monasteries, but the gossip is still going on in the secondary literature.

28
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,760
What does it tell us that the body of Zosima is stinking, as Rakedin says?

29
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,041
And you'll see later in the book.

30
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,520
How many have managed to finish it over vacation now?

31
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,520
Or managed to finish it, whatever.

32
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:49,120
Okay, well, it doesn't give away the plot to say that Elusha dies, and Elusha's body remains absolutely pure and doesn't smell at all.

33
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,760
So people say, gee, what is there wrong with Zosima?

34
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:53,120
Write about Elusha.

35
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,320
Well, if you look into it, you discover that the windows were closed.

36
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,281
I won't read it, but on 378 it talks about that.

37
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:02,481
There are no flowers.

38
00:04:02,481 --> 00:04:08,801
It talks a lot about the flowers, the windows being open around Elusha's coffin.

39
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,001
The elders are not washed when they die.

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,401
That's just a traditional thing.

41
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,961
He mentions that on right off on 375, three lines down.

42
00:04:18,961 --> 00:04:23,120
As is well known, the bodies of dead monks and hermits are not washed.

43
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:30,000
And it was a warm autumn day, which you'll learn in the next chapter when Alyasha runs out of the monastery into the weather.

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:41,960
Well, given that the windows are closed, there are no flowers, the body is not washed, and it's a warm autumn day, do you think it's a positive miracle or a negative miracle or just something natural?

45
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,041
Pretty easy, I hope.

46
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,641
A no-brainer is supposed to be.

47
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,760
It's just something natural.

48
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,680
It might happen to anybody's body under those conditions.

49
00:04:50,680 --> 00:05:07,320
And that's what you're supposed to think, because you're not supposed to expect a miracle to be something that goes against the laws of physics and chemistry by either condemning somebody by their body rotting too fast or giving any credit to anybody because their body isn't decomposing.

50
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,801
And it's just a wrong way to think about it.

51
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:12,200
That's a magical kind of miracle.

52
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:18,760
And the whole point is, if Dostoevsky is going to deal with it, he's going to deal with it in an entirely different way.

53
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,640
He's not going to make it a miracle that goes against the laws of physics and chemistry.

54
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,281
It's that Zosima's body stinks because of the laws of physics and chemistry.

55
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,560
That's how it is.

56
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,680
It doesn't mean anything.

57
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,680
That's the first thing to know.

58
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,361
But now back to the important question.

59
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:46,041
How does Alyasha feel about the fact that Zosima's body is, Zosima is not performing a miracle?

60
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,560
And then on the middle of 378, it gives him a terrible shock.

61
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:08,441
It brought a crisis, middle of 378, brought a crisis and turning point to his spiritual development, giving a shock to his intellect, which finally strengthened it for the rest of his life and gave it a definite aim.

62
00:06:08,441 --> 00:06:10,041
We haven't got to that yet.

63
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:22,961
But already we've got to the point where we can see, and it's clearer on 389, that Alyasha absolutely needs a miracle in order to keep his faith in Zosima.

64
00:06:22,961 --> 00:06:38,160
So the answer: can people, really good people, deep spiritual people, sort of strong people like Alyasha, live in the face of moral spiritual crises without any miracle and keep their faith?

65
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,761
The answer is no.

66
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,841
The Alyasha people, the Grand Inquisitor is right, people need miracles.

67
00:06:45,841 --> 00:06:55,201
What he's wrong about is that you just manufacture them by making all paces that appear on veils and so forth in the Catholic Church.

68
00:06:55,201 --> 00:06:59,681
That's not what Dostoevsky wants, that they do need miracles.

69
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,561
Now, and so now what's going to happen?

70
00:07:04,561 --> 00:07:12,801
Well, what's going to happen is Alyasha is going into a kind of decline starting on 389.

71
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,241
All kinds of bad things are happening to him.

72
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,081
And they're happening to him.

73
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:23,441
And Dostoevsky is always so brilliantly saying about three or four different things at once.

74
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:29,441
Dostoevsky is telling you how much Alyasha's love is wrapped up in Zosima.

75
00:07:29,441 --> 00:07:36,481
And the fact that Zosima isn't performing miracles is, let's see.

76
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:50,880
And the way his love is wrapped up in Zosima is such that when Zosima doesn't perform miracles, then Alyasha is going to lose sort of the object of his defining love.

77
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,161
So, this is, I'll make it clearer in a minute, on 389, two-thirds down.

78
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:12,041
The fact is that all the love that lay concealed in his pure young heart for everyone and everything had for the past year been concentrated, and perhaps wrongly so, and indeed wrongly so, on one being, his beloved elders, and so forth and so forth.

79
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:28,601
And it's true that his elder had for so long been accepted by him as his ideal that all his young strength and energy could not but turn toward the ideal, even to the forgetting at that moment of everyone and everything, when his ideal elder is dying or dead, I guess, at this point.

80
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:41,801
Then he remembered afterwards, I'm still on 389, how on that terrible day, the day of the body decomposed, he had entirely forgotten his brother Dimitri, about whom he had been worried, and so forth.

81
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:51,961
So he's oh, now remember, we've seen that Ivan says, I'm not my brother's keeper, and Smerzhikov says, Why should I know about and care about what Dimitri is doing?

82
00:08:51,961 --> 00:08:55,081
And now even Alyasha isn't caring about Dmitry.

83
00:08:55,081 --> 00:08:57,241
That's very bad.

84
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:06,601
And I've been saying he needs miracles to keep from losing his faith because all of his love is wrapped up in Zosima.

85
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:13,161
Zosima ought to be a super being, a super spiritual being, and that ought to be shown by miracles.

86
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,921
And it's not happening.

87
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:24,280
But it's tricky because these lines at the bottom of 389 make it look like I'm wrong, but I'm not.

88
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,041
And you'll see in a minute.

89
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:38,441
It was not miracles he needed, the narrator says, but only the higher justice, which had been, in his belief, outraged by the blow that has so suddenly and cruelly wounded his heart.

90
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:40,761
That's decomposition.

91
00:09:41,241 --> 00:09:43,561
And what was the higher justice?

92
00:09:43,561 --> 00:09:53,681
Well, the higher justice was that if Zosima is really a sort of spiritual star, I mean, a saint, then he shouldn't decompose.

93
00:09:54,241 --> 00:10:04,321
And what does it signify that this justice looked for by Alyasha took the form of miracles to be wrought immediately by the ashes of his adored elder?

94
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:05,041
Why?

95
00:10:05,361 --> 00:10:07,040
And so forth and so forth.

96
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,281
Let me skip a little, but it was justice, justice he thirsts for, not miracles.

97
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,201
Well, that doesn't really make any sense.

98
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:14,000
Rightly.

99
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,441
I mean, the narrator is sort of inside Alyasha, and he's telling us what Alyasha really wanted was a miracle.

100
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:25,201
But he puts, Alyasha is putting it in a very strange way.

101
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,361
He's putting it by saying he demands justice.

102
00:10:29,361 --> 00:10:32,801
Why is he putting it in this mysteriously strange way?

103
00:10:33,201 --> 00:10:34,561
Do you know?

104
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:44,801
Who thinks in terms of sort of whether we should accept or not the world, in terms of whether the world is just or not?

105
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,000
Ivan.

106
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,640
He's corrupted by Yvonne.

107
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:53,521
And you can see that at the top of 391.

108
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:57,120
Well, let me read the middle of 390 first.

109
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:08,320
Even had there been no miracles, had there been nothing marvelous, why this indignity, why this humiliation, this premature decay, the excess of nature, as the spiteful monk said.

110
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:17,601
In other words, he's not understanding none of them are, that this is just perfectly natural given the windows and the washing and so forth.

111
00:11:17,601 --> 00:11:21,601
And he's seeing it through the conversation with Yvonne.

112
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:31,041
Remember, in the background is Dostoevsky constantly showing you how different, how people influence and corrupt and help each other.

113
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,281
And Yvonne has corrupted him.

114
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,161
So the top of 390.

115
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:43,961
I will not forget, however, forget to mention something strange, which for a time came to the surface of Alyasha's mind at this fatal moment.

116
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:50,760
This new something was the harassing impression left by the conversation with Yvonne, which now persistently haunted Alyasha.

117
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,361
At this moment, it haunted him.

118
00:11:52,361 --> 00:12:00,601
Well, it was not that something of fundamental, elemental, so to speak, faith of his soul, it's not that the faith of his soul had been shaken.

119
00:12:00,601 --> 00:12:06,520
He loved his God and firmly believed in him, though he was suddenly murmuring against him.

120
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,920
Remember, Yvonne says, I believe in God, or at least it doesn't matter whether you believe in God.

121
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,241
The question is whether you accept his world.

122
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:19,481
And now he have, you know, faith, and Alyasha is beginning to lose his.

123
00:12:19,481 --> 00:12:28,681
A vague but tormenting and evil impression left by his conversation with Yvonne the day before revived again in his soul and seemed forcing its way to the surface.

124
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:40,760
So Yvonne has fed him up for having this rebellion reaction to the decomposition of Zosima, which is a special case of the general principle.

125
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,641
When you're in a spiritual crisis, you need miracles.

126
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:56,921
And Alyasha is in a spiritual crisis because his beloved monk is dying, has died, and is decomposing, and he needs a miracle, and he isn't getting it.

127
00:12:56,921 --> 00:13:02,841
At that moment, he's very close to losing his faith.

128
00:13:02,841 --> 00:13:05,481
And guess who arrives on the scene?

129
00:13:05,481 --> 00:13:08,401
Exactly at that moment.

130
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,601
On 391.

131
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:19,040
It was dusk when Rakitin, crossing the pine grove from the hermitage to the monastery, suddenly noticed Alyasha lying downward on the ground under a tree and so forth.

132
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:20,160
He went up and called him.

133
00:13:20,481 --> 00:13:36,561
So Alyasha has thrown himself on the ground in despair, really, that this person whom he loves and who's the unconditional commitment of his life isn't being recognized by the universe or by God as he should be.

134
00:13:36,561 --> 00:13:46,481
And now comes this conversation with Rakitin to just to say, again, remind you that Rakitin is the existentialized devil.

135
00:13:46,481 --> 00:14:04,401
He behaves, he behaves in the world the way the devil, in sort of Christian mythology, from Dostoevsky's point of view, believes that namely, the devil is going around in the world, undermining people's faith.

136
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:12,961
He shows up when they're about to lose their faith, and instead of strengthening their faith, contributes to undermining it.

137
00:14:12,961 --> 00:14:16,081
That's just what Rakitin is now going to do.

138
00:14:16,081 --> 00:14:21,680
On 392, he says at the top, can you be so upset because your old man has begun to stink?

139
00:14:21,681 --> 00:14:26,320
You don't mean you believed he was going to work miracles, exclaimed Rakitin.

140
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,280
And then he's really upset.

141
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,721
He says, I believe, I believe, I want to believe, cried Alyasha.

142
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:36,880
And then Rakitin says, Damn it all.

143
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,920
Why no schoolboy of 13 believes in that now?

144
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:43,681
And there, so now you're angry with God, you're rebelling against him.

145
00:14:43,681 --> 00:14:48,640
See, he recognizes that it's the rebellion of like Ivan.

146
00:14:48,961 --> 00:14:51,681
And now look what happens in the middle.

147
00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:53,201
I'm not rebelling against my God.

148
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:54,961
I simply don't accept his world.

149
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:57,600
Alyasha suddenly smiled a forced smile.

150
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:07,000
He's being taken over by Yvonne, sort of challenging, challenging, channeling Yvonne at this point.

151
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:14,600
And now Rakitin sees that he's got a chance to really turn him against God altogether.

152
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,000
And then he begins his temptations.

153
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,040
Let me just make sure I am where I want to be.

154
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,760
Yeah.

155
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,840
So, anybody want to say anything?

156
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:28,840
I don't like it when I just go on and on, but I must admit, I can't think of anything anybody could say at this point, does he?

157
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:40,360
As he is laying it out even more clearly, he's going to hit you over the head with this whole miracle story, absolutely, so that I don't see any alternative interpretation.

158
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,961
So let's go on and if you do, challenge it, please.

159
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,840
So, what does he say?

160
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:52,920
Well, he says at the bottom of 392, Rakitin says, I've got some sausage in my pocket.

161
00:15:52,921 --> 00:15:56,520
And it must be, I think it's lint.

162
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,760
It's something that he shouldn't be eating sausage.

163
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,120
And Alyasha says, give me some.

164
00:16:02,121 --> 00:16:03,081
And he says, what?

165
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,041
You're going to eat it?

166
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,321
It's a regular mutiny.

167
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,840
The rebellion, of course.

168
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,241
And he said, Would you like some vodka?

169
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,561
I suppose vodka's going too far for you.

170
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,641
You know, the devil is tempting him step by step.

171
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:15,721
And he says, Give me some vodka, too.

172
00:16:15,881 --> 00:16:17,481
You surprise me, Alyasha.

173
00:16:17,641 --> 00:16:19,961
Rakitin looked at him in amazement.

174
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,121
So at the bottom of 393, he pulls the ultimate thing.

175
00:16:24,121 --> 00:16:26,281
He's going to really run Alyasha.

176
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,201
He knows that Alyasha has a Karamatsov.

177
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,881
It seems practically genetic.

178
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,801
He lusts after Grushenka.

179
00:16:34,121 --> 00:16:35,881
So does old Karamatsov.

180
00:16:35,881 --> 00:16:37,241
Everybody but Ivan.

181
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:42,760
But so, anyway, so at the bottom of 393, Rakitin says, let's go to Grushenka's.

182
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,961
Will you come?

183
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,560
And Alyasha says, yeah, let's go to Grushenka's.

184
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,201
So he answers calmly, and he's off.

185
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:01,121
And it turns out that Grushenka has bribed Rakitin to bring Alyasha because she wants to seduce him.

186
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:06,080
At the end of the next paragraph, his object, namely, it's interesting.

187
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,481
We want to know, you want to make sure that Rakitin's the devil?

188
00:17:08,481 --> 00:17:11,600
Well, read the last bit of that chapter.

189
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,120
His, Rakitin's object in this case was twofold.

190
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:19,040
First, a revengeful desire to see the downfall of the righteous.

191
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:25,840
Well, that's just a perfectly demonic, evil, and it's the essence of the evil notion.

192
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,280
Instead of supporting the righteous, he wants to bring them down.

193
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,520
And Alyasha's fall from saint to sinner, that's what he wants.

194
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,441
See, only the devil wants that.

195
00:17:35,441 --> 00:17:40,641
Everybody else would like everybody who were sinners to become saints and help them do it.

196
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:43,520
That's what Alyasha does, because Alyasha is an angel.

197
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,320
As you see many times, if you watch for it, Alyasha is always described as an angel.

198
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:54,401
And in the second place, Rakitin had a certain material gain in view.

199
00:17:54,401 --> 00:17:54,881
Yeah.

200
00:17:54,881 --> 00:18:01,600
Well, yes, Grushenka has bribed him, told him he'd get a reward if he brings Alyasha to her house.

201
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:10,161
So, and if Alyasha doesn't get a miracle, he's going to lose his faith, and Rakitin's going to help him do it.

202
00:18:10,161 --> 00:18:12,880
I think I've read everything that's important.

203
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah, 392.

204
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,560
Yeah, I just catching up.

205
00:18:20,881 --> 00:18:22,800
Okay, we're so far.

206
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:24,721
Now I'm at a stopping point.

207
00:18:24,721 --> 00:18:30,080
Namely, like a scene shift, the next thing they arrive at Grushenka's.

208
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,161
And that's when Dostoevsky's going to pull off his amazing coup.

209
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,161
So they arrive at Grushenka's.

210
00:18:37,401 --> 00:18:42,920
Now we have to switch and talk about what state of mind Grushenka is in.

211
00:18:42,921 --> 00:19:07,640
She is having a kind of fit of excitement and mixture of joy and anger because, and now you need to know a little bit about what happened to her on 395, a third of the way down, there were rumors that she had been at 17, betrayed by someone, some sort of officer, and immediately afterwards abandoned by him.

212
00:19:07,641 --> 00:19:12,760
The officer had gone away and married, while Grushenka had been left in poverty and disgrace.

213
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:22,040
And that's, and that officer, that Polish officer, the wife has died, and he's coming back and calling for Grushenka.

214
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:35,080
And she is alternately sort of humiliated and outraged, he's just whistling for her like a dog, and happy that he's going to, he's ready to marry her.

215
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,000
And she's in a state of great excitement about all.

216
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,721
That's what we're hearing about at this point.

217
00:19:43,721 --> 00:19:54,121
And just at the bottom of 397, she's so excited, her face was pale, her lips and eyes hot, and she was restlessly tapping her arm and so forth.

218
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,760
He's all upset.

219
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,441
She doesn't know what to do in the face of this.

220
00:20:00,681 --> 00:20:04,280
The middle of 402, she says, My officer is coming, Rakita.

221
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,800
My officer is coming.

222
00:20:05,881 --> 00:20:07,081
I heard he was coming.

223
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,361
Did he see so near?

224
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,880
He's at Muckrow right now.

225
00:20:09,961 --> 00:20:11,721
He'll send a messenger from there.

226
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:13,961
So he wrote, I got a letter from him today.

227
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:16,040
I'm expecting the messenger any minute.

228
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,721
So she's that's her optimistic, I mean, hopeful view.

229
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:44,721
But she's got, she's got this problem that she doesn't, she doesn't know whether she will or and go to him with a knife or like a dog, because she doesn't know whether her she wants to revenge herself against him for what he did to her when she was 17 or whether she's going to come when he calls her because he's going to make her an honest woman at this point.

230
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,600
That this is, she says it on 408, about two-thirds of the way down.

231
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,560
It took my breath away.

232
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,840
Then I suddenly thought, if he comes and whistles to me, I'll creep back to him like a beaten dog.

233
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,081
And then she says at the bottom of the page, perhaps I'll take a knife with me today.

234
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,160
I can't make up my mind.

235
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:11,360
And a little above the bottom, before you came in, she says to Alyasha, I was lying here waiting, brooding, deciding my whole future life, and you can never know what was in my heart.

236
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,721
Although she's pretty well told him now what was in her heart.

237
00:21:14,721 --> 00:21:16,320
These two alternatives.

238
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,840
And it's important to realize, which isn't very hard, that these are two destructive alternatives.

239
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,201
I mean, there's nothing, nothing good can happen to her.

240
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:35,520
If she goes to him like a dog, she'll feel humiliated all the rest of her life with no sense of her own value.

241
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,000
And if she goes to him with a knife, she goes to Siberia as a murderer.

242
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,040
So she and she doesn't know, there's no way out.

243
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,880
She's in a kind of trap.

244
00:21:44,881 --> 00:21:50,161
And at that point, I've jumped ahead to tell you what's going on.

245
00:21:50,161 --> 00:22:05,961
What really happens back at 401, as soon as they come in, she jumps onto Alyasha's lap, and she's interested in, looks like she's busy trying to seduce him on 401.

246
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,201
Where did she jump into his lap?

247
00:22:02,881 --> 00:22:09,000
Let's see.

248
00:22:09,721 --> 00:22:11,241
I think I just lost what it is.

249
00:22:11,481 --> 00:22:12,040
401.

250
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,201
I've got 401 in front of me, but I'm not sure.

251
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:15,320
Oh, yeah, there it is.

252
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,400
Okay, we're a third of the way down.

253
00:22:18,681 --> 00:22:21,400
Rakitin says his elder stinks, and she says, What?

254
00:22:21,401 --> 00:22:23,080
You're talking nonsense.

255
00:22:23,401 --> 00:22:26,040
And let me sit on your knee, Alyasha, like this.

256
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:31,640
He suddenly got up and laughing nestled like a kitten on his knee with her right arm about his neck.

257
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,880
I'll cheer you up, my pious boy.

258
00:22:33,881 --> 00:22:35,320
You'll let me sit on your knee.

259
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,680
You won't be angry.

260
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:39,560
If you tell me, I'll get off.

261
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,320
Now comes one of the crucial paragraphs.

262
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,481
How is Alyasha going to take this?

263
00:22:45,481 --> 00:22:49,481
As a Karamatsov, he's sort of lusting for her.

264
00:22:49,481 --> 00:22:55,880
And as somebody who is scared of anything that has to do with sex, he's afraid of her.

265
00:22:55,881 --> 00:22:57,961
And here she is sitting on his lap.

266
00:22:57,961 --> 00:22:59,640
Okay, well, here's what happens.

267
00:22:59,641 --> 00:23:00,920
Alyasha didn't speak.

268
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,361
He sat afraid to move.

269
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,961
He heard her words.

270
00:23:04,921 --> 00:23:06,361
If you tell me, I'll get off.

271
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,840
But there was nothing in his heart, such as Rakitin watching him might have expected.

272
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,080
The grief in his heart swallowed up every sensation that might have been aroused.

273
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:22,441
And if only he could have thought clearly at that moment, he would have realized that he had now the strongest armor to protect him from every lust and temptation.

274
00:23:22,441 --> 00:23:32,441
Yet, in spite of the vague irresponsiveness of his spiritual condition and sorrow that overwhelmed him, he couldn't help wondering at a new and strange sensation in his heart.

275
00:23:32,441 --> 00:23:34,441
Do you know what that is?

276
00:23:35,401 --> 00:23:37,241
What's happening to him?

277
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:58,320
Well, I think I wrote on the board once in some other connection, though I don't remember why, two crucial words to understand this: Eros, and what he's been feeling, erotic, agape, the Greek word for Christian love, for what gets translated charity, but that's not good anymore, so we just say agape love.

278
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:08,560
He's feeling the kind of love that he had for Zosima and that Zosima has for everybody.

279
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:14,961
And it's described here very briefly: a strange new sensation in his heart.

280
00:24:14,961 --> 00:24:23,280
This woman, I'm reading back on 401, this dreadful woman had no terror for him now, none of that terror that stirred in him at the passing thought of women.

281
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:36,880
On the contrary, this woman, dreaded above all women, sitting now on his knee, holding him in her arms, aroused him a quite different, unexpected, peculiar feeling, the feeling of the intensest and purest interest without a trace of fear.

282
00:24:36,881 --> 00:24:39,841
Some other translations say curiosity instead of interest.

283
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,441
That's definitely bad.

284
00:24:41,441 --> 00:24:46,080
I don't know the Russian, but you Russians listening to me, I have them out there.

285
00:24:46,481 --> 00:24:49,841
Let me know, but I'm sure that that's the right thing.

286
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:56,081
The purest interest is the agape, not a desire for anything.

287
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,840
Eros is desire.

288
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,441
Desire for something that you lack, but want.

289
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:12,401
This is love as overflowing goodness held for, and not something you want.

290
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:33,880
Okay, so now we've got the and Dalyach is sitting there, sort of too terrified, was too terrified to look at Krushchenka, but and but now he's got no eros.

291
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,721
It's all this new experience of agape that he's feeling.

292
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,600
Comments, anybody yet?

293
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:45,080
Okay, you sure?

294
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,080
Okay, okay, I'm going on.

295
00:25:49,401 --> 00:25:54,680
He's got this unselfish, disinterested interestedness.

296
00:25:54,681 --> 00:26:00,040
And that's what in this book is called active love.

297
00:26:00,121 --> 00:26:04,600
Zothima is a kind of specialist in active love.

298
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:11,000
And now it's as if Zothama has sort of contributed to Alyasha, who's caught it.

299
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,441
So he's got it too now, active love.

300
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:21,800
And Alyasha, and it turns out, now we need another move.

301
00:26:22,121 --> 00:26:34,280
Alyasha has been responsible for Grushenka's constant sense of worthlessness and humiliation, which is what she feels all the time.

302
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,681
And how could he be causing it?

303
00:26:36,681 --> 00:26:38,920
Not now, but in the past.

304
00:26:38,921 --> 00:26:41,721
Well, you want to say something?

305
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,800
That's right, exactly.

306
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:49,721
He's so attracted by her that he's afraid even to look at her.

307
00:26:49,721 --> 00:26:52,360
I think I told you maybe Marilyn Monroe wanted to play.

308
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:58,040
You've got to think of sort of Grushenka looking sort of like Marilyn Monroe with a dark wig, at least that's how I think of it.

309
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:06,441
And he can't resist her, so he can't look at her.

310
00:27:06,441 --> 00:27:14,441
But when he doesn't look at her, she understands that as he's disgusted by her.

311
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:17,481
Where does that happen?

312
00:27:17,681 --> 00:27:19,840
On the middle of 403.

313
00:27:19,161 --> 00:27:26,320
Rakitin is thinking, you know, that now she's going to seduce him, and she says, No, this is different.

314
00:27:26,481 --> 00:27:28,320
I love Alyasha in a different way.

315
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,360
It's true, Alyasha.

316
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:35,441
I had designs on you because I'm a horrid, violent creature, but at other times I've looked upon you, Alyasha, as my conscience.

317
00:27:35,441 --> 00:27:40,080
I kept thinking, how anyone like that must despise a nasty thing like me?

318
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,840
And then she says about him lowering his eyes, I have to find that.

319
00:27:45,921 --> 00:27:47,280
Did anybody see that?

320
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,481
If he doesn't look at her, I thought I'd mark it.

321
00:27:50,481 --> 00:27:51,201
Hmm.

322
00:27:51,201 --> 00:27:53,040
I don't know where it is.

323
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,681
But it's true that he casts his eyes down.

324
00:27:55,681 --> 00:27:57,840
We ought to be able to find that.

325
00:27:58,481 --> 00:28:03,040
Surely somebody will find it if I just look for it.

326
00:28:03,121 --> 00:28:04,721
No, maybe it's going to come up later.

327
00:28:04,721 --> 00:28:05,361
It's true.

328
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:23,840
Anyway, and he, the important thing is that by not looking at her, he's making her worse because he's making her feel worthless and humiliated as she says that he had even, he disdains her so much.

329
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:27,441
And now let's see where we are.

330
00:28:29,681 --> 00:28:31,600
He couldn't look at her.

331
00:28:31,921 --> 00:28:34,241
Well, I've got 407.

332
00:28:34,241 --> 00:28:36,560
Let's see if I say that in 407.

333
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,721
Yeah, here we are, in the middle of 407.

334
00:28:38,721 --> 00:28:40,320
I wanted to ruin you, Alyasha.

335
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,680
That's the holy truth.

336
00:28:41,681 --> 00:28:42,801
I quite meant to.

337
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,201
I wanted so much that I bribed Rakitin.

338
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:47,280
You knew nothing about it, Alyasha.

339
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,841
You turned away from me if you passed me on the street.

340
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,280
You dropped your eyes.

341
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:55,760
And I've looked at you a hundred times before today, and I began asking everyone about you.

342
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,201
Your face haunted my heart.

343
00:28:57,201 --> 00:28:58,961
He despises me, I thought.

344
00:28:58,961 --> 00:29:00,481
He won't even look at me.

345
00:29:00,481 --> 00:29:04,201
So that's her typical Dostoevsky thing.

346
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:09,801
The source of most bad actions are people feeling humiliated and disdained.

347
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:15,640
And if you loved them instead, you could cure them of what's making them make bad actions.

348
00:29:15,641 --> 00:29:26,360
She's being bad with Alyasha, or wanted to be, seduce him, and humiliate him because she thinks that he's humiliated her.

349
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:31,961
And then, but, of course, everything gets turned around.

350
00:29:31,961 --> 00:29:35,881
And she tells us that he's an angel.

351
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,840
Now we have to find that.

352
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,721
He says, why didn't you come before you, but you angel?

353
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,840
It's all in such funny order.

354
00:29:49,401 --> 00:29:51,241
Help me find that now.

355
00:29:51,241 --> 00:29:54,441
We have to go back because it happens before that.

356
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,920
We're back on 403.

357
00:29:58,921 --> 00:30:01,160
He thinks he despises me.

358
00:30:01,161 --> 00:30:02,201
And then.

359
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,560
And she has transformed Alyasha.

360
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,961
I'll read that while we're at it, the bottom of 404.

361
00:30:07,961 --> 00:30:11,481
He says, She pities me.

362
00:30:11,481 --> 00:30:13,241
I came here to find a wicked soul.

363
00:30:13,241 --> 00:30:16,201
I felt drawn to evil because I was base and evil myself.

364
00:30:16,201 --> 00:30:17,560
This is Alyasha talking.

365
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,841
And I found a true sister.

366
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,760
I found a treasure, a loving heart.

367
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,361
She had pity on me just now.

368
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,121
Gushenka, I'm speaking of you.

369
00:30:24,121 --> 00:30:26,201
You've raised my soul from the depth.

370
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:30,520
So they've sort of turned agape on each other.

371
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:37,640
And now she tells the story of the onion, which we're going to talk about next time.

372
00:30:37,641 --> 00:30:40,920
But I really want to find when she calls him an angel.

373
00:30:42,201 --> 00:30:43,961
Nobody's found it.

374
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,520
They are.

375
00:30:44,681 --> 00:30:45,881
Bottom of 411.

376
00:30:45,881 --> 00:30:48,120
You never know whether anything's going to turn up.

377
00:30:48,121 --> 00:30:50,081
Why didn't you come before, you angel?

378
00:30:50,241 --> 00:30:52,641
She fell on her knees before Alyasha.

379
00:30:52,641 --> 00:30:55,441
I've been waiting all my life for someone like you.

380
00:30:55,441 --> 00:30:57,920
I knew that someone like you would come and forgive me.

381
00:30:57,921 --> 00:31:02,880
I believe that nasty as I am, someone would really love me, not with a lustful love.

382
00:31:02,881 --> 00:31:09,920
That's the crucial, that's her experience of his turning his agape love on her.

383
00:31:09,921 --> 00:31:11,920
And he is an angel.

384
00:31:11,921 --> 00:31:18,320
And she affirms him, and he affirms her.

385
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,680
And now that she's got self-respect, she's got a new option.

386
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:32,961
She doesn't have to go back humiliated or revengeful, neither like a dog nor with a knife.

387
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:41,760
But she can go back with sort of hope and joy and look over this Polish guy and see whether she wants to spend her life with him or not.

388
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:49,040
And Alyacha says she won't take a knife with her, the middle of 409.

389
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:51,121
He sees that she's been transformed.

390
00:31:51,121 --> 00:32:01,921
He says, after five years of torment, as soon as anyone says a word from the heart to her, that's the agape, it makes her forget everything, forgive everything.

391
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,681
The man who wronged her has come back.

392
00:32:03,681 --> 00:32:08,960
He sends for her and she forgives him everything and hurries to meet him and she won't take a knife with her.

393
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,800
So she's not going with a knife.

394
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,881
She's not going like a dog.

395
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,201
And that's now what's happened there.

396
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:35,480
Well, it's because the love that he had focused, perhaps mistakenly, and Dostoevsky thinks really mistakenly, because it leads him to forget Dmitry, is now free, thanks to the fact that she is taken pity on Alyasha.

397
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:43,561
And the love that he had all directed toward Zosima is now freed up so he can turn it on to other people.

398
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:51,080
He didn't help anybody or love anybody, if you look in the book, until Zosima died and he went to Grushenka.

399
00:32:51,641 --> 00:33:04,361
And Rakitin, and Dostia is constantly putting, if you want to know what's really going on, pay attention to the person who would be most critical of what was really going on and see what he thinks.

400
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,641
So it's Rakitin's view of all this, which is getting it right.

401
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:17,481
So on 409, Rakitin says, a third of the way down, so you are so primed up with your elders' teaching last night that now you have let it off on me.

402
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,520
Rakitin, Alyasha tries to love Rakitin.

403
00:33:20,521 --> 00:33:21,241
It doesn't work.

404
00:33:21,241 --> 00:33:22,840
He says, Alyasha, man of God.

405
00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:27,080
Rakitin said, with a smile of hatred.

406
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,161
But in fact, it didn't work when he turned it off on Rakitin.

407
00:33:31,161 --> 00:33:37,321
But when he sort of, how's Rakitin let it off, this love onto Grushenka?

408
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,681
It did work.

409
00:33:38,681 --> 00:33:40,201
It did transform her.

410
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:41,721
So now where are we?

411
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:47,481
They've had this reciprocal agape situation.

412
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,961
And what has happened?

413
00:33:49,960 --> 00:34:00,041
Well, that agape love, which comes from Zosima, has done something which you have to describe in the right way.

414
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:15,241
It's created out of nothing a third alternative, which is not destructive for Grushenka, who's up to then had been in this kind of trap of contemplating two destructive alternatives, the knife and the dog.

415
00:34:15,241 --> 00:34:29,840
A new alternative is there, namely, she goes back with joy and neither like a knife or with a life or like a dog, and she just decides on after looking him over what to do with the hole.

416
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:39,921
And she's saying she's flying to a new life, as she puts it at the two-thirds down on 4:12.

417
00:34:40,241 --> 00:34:44,241
Now, now comes what just happened.

418
00:34:44,241 --> 00:34:51,681
Well, Dostoevsky's going to put it in the mouth of the devil, what just happened?

419
00:34:51,681 --> 00:34:53,760
Do you know what just happened?

420
00:34:54,400 --> 00:35:03,681
This creation out of nothing, of a positive possibility where there are only negative possibilities, where a soul was saved by being looked at with a God they love.

421
00:35:03,681 --> 00:35:05,280
What's the name for that?

422
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,960
A miracle has happened.

423
00:35:07,121 --> 00:35:14,800
But less you don't notice it, and I certainly wouldn't have, and you probably wouldn't have, Dostoevsky will, of course, hit you over the head with it.

424
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,120
And here it is at the bottom of 4:13.

425
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:26,320
Ratiaton says, So you saved the sinner, he laughed spitefully, you turned the Magdalene into the true path, driven out the seven devils, eh?

426
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,721
So you see, the miracles you were looking for just now have come to pass.

427
00:35:30,721 --> 00:35:32,001
Well, that's pretty clear.

428
00:35:32,001 --> 00:35:33,361
He needed miracles.

429
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,601
He couldn't keep his faith without miracles.

430
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:40,080
He got a miracle, namely the saving of Grushenka.

431
00:35:40,081 --> 00:35:41,280
He's now okay.

432
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,481
He's been saved by rebound, so to speak.

433
00:35:45,201 --> 00:35:55,280
And all of this is part of this miracle, this love that he loaded up from Zosima, which he now turned on Grushenka.

434
00:35:55,601 --> 00:36:03,760
And so the saintliness of Zosima is ratified by this miracle.

435
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:12,201
But it isn't quite nailed down yet because it's pretty tenuous, the relation of this miracle to Zosima.

436
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:16,280
Remember, Zosima, Alyasha doesn't need just any old miracle.

437
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:28,201
He has to have a miracle performed by Zosima if it's going to justify his love, or which is Ivan's way of putting it, if it's going to, let's say, confirm and strengthen his faith.

438
00:36:28,201 --> 00:36:31,721
So Dostoevsky's going to hit you over the head a few more times.

439
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:44,520
Again, very clearly, it's Zosima's love that performs these miracles, which don't abrogate the laws of nature, but nonetheless produce these amazing transformations.

440
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:51,081
And when he goes back to the monastery, he discovers the following thing.

441
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,001
But let me just say one more thing, and then I will get to that.

442
00:36:55,241 --> 00:37:00,280
Right after that miracle story, Rakitin at the bottom of the page behaves like a devil again.

443
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,320
He says, Damnation take you all and each of you, he cried.

444
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,321
Why the devil did I take you to Grushenka?

445
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:12,841
Well, I mean, that's just Rakitin over and over naming you that he's the devil.

446
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:19,560
But now, what happens when he gets to Father Zosima?

447
00:37:19,561 --> 00:37:23,161
Then we get more miracle talk.

448
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:30,760
The important thing is that I'm amazed I don't have it here written down.

449
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,161
If I don't, I will have to find it anyway.

450
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:36,201
It's a question of the first miracle.

451
00:37:36,201 --> 00:37:41,881
Well, when he gets back to the monastery, okay, I don't have it written down, but I know where it is.

452
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,280
So they've opened the windows.

453
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,481
The smell got so strong that they finally did that.

454
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,361
But that's not what's important.

455
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:54,961
He began on the top of 415 listening to what Father Piasy was reading.

456
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,760
And what was Father Piasi reading?

457
00:37:58,721 --> 00:38:15,280
If you want to be covered over the head again, the story of the first miracle, of the fish and the wine at Canaan, where Jesus goes at this wedding and there's not enough fish to go around, and he fixes it so there's plenty.

458
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:27,600
There was this great story in the New Yorker about a year ago about this, where this girl who's following around Jesus, because she's a kind of Jesus groupie, has written in her notebook, and Jesus did this wonderful thing.

459
00:38:27,601 --> 00:38:32,961
He invented canopates, kind of little, you know, little things with a little dab of fish on each one.

460
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,441
So the fish went far and fed everybody.

461
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,360
That is the wrong way to think about the miracle, but it's pretty funny.

462
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:46,320
But what happens really is, Jesus, and this is important, just breaks the laws of physics and chemistry.

463
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,641
He doesn't invent little fish sandwiches.

464
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:53,440
He makes a whole lot of fish where there was only a little, and a whole lot of wine where there was only a little.

465
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,560
That's because that was the first miracle.

466
00:38:57,201 --> 00:39:04,321
It was understood by the people at the time, at least, as doing what miracles are supposed to do, break the laws of physics and chemistry.

467
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:13,440
But it's clear that what was the important thing about that miracle, its miracleness, so to speak, is directly related to what happened with Grushenka.

468
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:21,600
It's just that things have gone on so that you can't have that kind of miracle anymore that violates the laws.

469
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,680
What you can have is, instead, existentialized miracles.

470
00:39:25,681 --> 00:39:36,120
So you get a story connecting the first miracle with the bread and wine miracle to the current miracle, the latest one, saving Grushenka.

471
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:42,520
And you get it also relating Zosima into the story with Grushenka.

472
00:39:42,521 --> 00:39:47,160
Now, all that's happening when he goes back on page 415.

473
00:39:47,161 --> 00:39:52,121
So he's reading the story about the marriage and so forth.

474
00:39:53,081 --> 00:40:08,441
And when they wanted more wine in italics, then they got wine, and he's thinking, that's wonderful, they're happy, and everybody's glad I'm just skimming.

475
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,201
And that's the first miracle.

476
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:18,121
And so then, okay, now it gets directly related to Zosima in 4:17.

477
00:40:19,721 --> 00:40:21,560
And he's having this vision.

478
00:40:21,561 --> 00:40:24,121
Zosima's dead, but he's having a vision of what's happening.

479
00:40:24,201 --> 00:40:26,121
Zosima's talking to him.

480
00:40:26,121 --> 00:40:33,320
So the feast of Canaan turns into at the top of 4:17, Zosima talking.

481
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:36,841
Yes, my son, I'm called to call and bidden.

482
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,880
He heard a soft voice saying, Why have you hidden yourself?

483
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,321
Come and join us.

484
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:46,201
It was the voice of Father Zosima, and it must be he since he called him.

485
00:40:46,201 --> 00:40:51,080
The elder took Alyasha by the hand and raised him from his knees and so forth.

486
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:54,120
He's invited to the feast of Canaan.

487
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:57,641
The first miracle is being linked with the latest miracle.

488
00:40:57,641 --> 00:40:59,641
It's clear that they're both miracles.

489
00:40:59,641 --> 00:41:06,361
One is the earlier kind of miracle, but the latest one is the existentialized miracle.

490
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:11,721
And they're all traced these miracles, the second one that is, is traced to Zosima.

491
00:41:11,721 --> 00:41:36,641
And now, I can't tell you why it's important that the elder takes Alyasha by the hand, but there is something called the apostolic succession of bishops, in which in a magical way, it was thought that the bishop, that Jesus gave agate love to Peter, who passes it on to all the bishops.

492
00:41:36,641 --> 00:41:39,201
And only the Catholic Church is in this succession.

493
00:41:39,201 --> 00:41:50,960
It's the big fight between the Catholic Church and the Episcopal Church that sometime in history, time of Henry VIII, maybe I'm not good on history, that they lost touch with the apostolic succession.

494
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,800
Now, of course, that's too magical.

495
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:59,280
Gostoevsky doesn't care about how laying on the hands passed on this love from bishop to bishop.

496
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,001
The way to pass on love is to love people.

497
00:42:02,001 --> 00:42:12,401
But I wondered when I read it, we better, and I followed it because you'll see that Markle also puts his hand on Zosima at a certain point and says, go live for me.

498
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,001
And now I wondered how Zosima is going to pass this on to Alyasha.

499
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:18,401
Well, he does.

500
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:34,960
And on 4:17, when he takes Alyasha by the hand and raises him, it's like in Star Trek, where Spock has this thing he has to pass on to, and you wonder, I forget which Star Trek it is, how he manages to pass it on.

501
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,681
And they look at the picture, and yes, yes, he does just touch whoever it is.

502
00:42:39,681 --> 00:42:42,800
I think it's the doctor.

503
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,480
But anyway, that's, again, the magical kind.

504
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:57,441
But this was just the fact, important that at this crucial moment in this vision, he gets this connection with Zosima.

505
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:03,441
Now, I think we've got as far as we need to get with that, but I want to make sure.

506
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,040
Well, there's one puzzle which I can't answer.

507
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:11,321
Well, in 317, I'll just say it briefly because I want to make sure we have enough time for what's going to happen next.

508
00:43:11,641 --> 00:43:23,081
But there's this funny fact, which I'm going to, one of the Alex, who knows whose natural language is Russian, his first language is Russian, is going to help me to understand the following thing.

509
00:43:23,081 --> 00:43:31,241
When he's talking to Zosima, Zosima says in the middle of the page, the end of that big paragraph, begin your work, dear one.

510
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:32,681
Begin it, gentle one.

511
00:43:32,681 --> 00:43:34,120
Do you see our son?

512
00:43:34,121 --> 00:43:35,241
Do you see him?

513
00:43:35,241 --> 00:43:36,601
S-O-N.

514
00:43:36,601 --> 00:43:39,481
Well, in another translation, it's S-U-N.

515
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:52,760
Well, that looks like a big difference, where one of them seems to be Jesus, a son with a capital S, the Son of God, and the other one seems to be an astronomical shining body.

516
00:43:53,320 --> 00:44:04,280
My guess is that there is some Russian word that means something like, in English we say, somebody was the light of my life.

517
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:07,480
I think that's what this word is trying to do.

518
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:21,480
It's trying to bring together the Jesus story with the story that there can be other people, like Zosima is the light of Alyasha's life.

519
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,960
And if you've got to Markle, how many of you read the Markle part?

520
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:24,840
Presumably you have.

521
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,200
We're going to talk about it next time.

522
00:44:26,201 --> 00:44:31,961
Zosima's brother, who passes on this love, is the light of Zosima's life.

523
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:41,241
These are, by the way, remember these mysterious fingers that point Zosima to the monastery and point Alyasha, so to speak, out of the monastery?

524
00:44:41,241 --> 00:44:44,681
That's all the channeled love of Markle.

525
00:44:44,681 --> 00:44:47,001
But put that off for the time being.

526
00:44:47,001 --> 00:45:08,081
So, what you get is that there's something like this, that Zosima is passing on this love, which was charged up when Alyasha loved him with Agape love, to Alyasha, who is going to pass it on, we don't know yet how, into the world.

527
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,720
But so much for that.

528
00:45:10,721 --> 00:45:12,321
That's the next stopping point.

529
00:45:13,601 --> 00:45:14,960
I think, let me just look.

530
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,721
Yeah, the next, that's.

531
00:45:17,041 --> 00:45:19,681
So, anybody want to say anything about that?

532
00:45:19,681 --> 00:45:20,241
Yeah.

533
00:45:20,561 --> 00:45:21,440
Hooray.

534
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,921
I didn't hear the question very well.

535
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,561
Is there a personal situation?

536
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:31,440
My own personal me?

537
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:31,920
Yeah.

538
00:45:33,201 --> 00:45:34,080
One has it.

539
00:45:34,081 --> 00:45:34,480
Yeah.

540
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,360
One has it.

541
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:51,280
Oh, that's a terrific question because you are exactly, how does it feel to get this love, to get in touch with the light, which is the light of agape, and have it shine on you and through you?

542
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,481
How would that feel?

543
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,840
That's your question?

544
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,081
Is that that I changed it?

545
00:45:56,081 --> 00:45:56,640
Yes.

546
00:45:56,641 --> 00:45:57,920
Okay, how nice.

547
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,681
The next page is the answer.

548
00:45:59,681 --> 00:46:01,920
You asked exactly the right question.

549
00:46:02,241 --> 00:46:02,880
Exactly.

550
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,601
At the bottom of 4:17.

551
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,201
And it starts out, let's start with the paragraph before the end.

552
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:14,880
Something glowed in Alyosha's heart, something filled it until it ached.

553
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,441
Tears of rapture rose from his soul.

554
00:46:17,601 --> 00:46:21,041
He stretched out his hands, uttered a cry, and woke up.

555
00:46:21,041 --> 00:46:23,280
Now, this has been a vision that he's had.

556
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:37,320
But this vision is crucial because it ties the first miracle to the latest miracle, and it ties them both to Zosima, and it sort of reinforces the argument that the point that Dossia is making.

557
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,481
But now comes a whole new point, her point.

558
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:43,001
And what does Alyasha experience at this point?

559
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,920
Okay, let's see.

560
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:56,521
Alyasha didn't listen to the reading, and he went up to the coffin and so forth, and he gazed for a minute in the coffin, and now comes the crucial thing.

561
00:46:56,521 --> 00:47:00,681
We've got to read almost every word of the rest of the chapter.

562
00:47:00,681 --> 00:47:02,040
It's very beautiful.

563
00:47:02,041 --> 00:47:10,280
Dostoevsky at his most amazing, and it's absolutely central to the book, literally central to the book, if you look at it.

564
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:18,121
I mean, I think Dostoevsky thinks architectonically, that is, if he thinks if it's the most important thing in the book, it ought to be in the middle of the book.

565
00:47:18,121 --> 00:47:18,921
And it is.

566
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,201
Okay, and what happens?

567
00:47:20,201 --> 00:47:21,401
I'm going to read things.

568
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:30,041
He did not stop on the steps either, but went quickly down, his soul overflowing with rapture, learning for freedom, space, and openness.

569
00:47:30,041 --> 00:47:31,641
Well, that's already interesting.

570
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:59,081
Dostoevsky, and it's so moving when you're reading it, because Dostoevsky, you realize later, has kept you sort of cooped up in a world in which everybody is in everybody's face in these hot rooms and monks and inns and so forth, that you don't feel nature, you don't feel openness, but he is now yearning for freedom, space, and openness.

571
00:47:59,081 --> 00:48:07,881
And the sort of the, if you see it as a movie, as I always do when I read these things, it goes into cinema scope, big super cinema scope, and it goes into color.

572
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:12,041
You haven't heard anything about color, but you're about to hear about color.

573
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:13,080
I'll read some more.

574
00:48:13,081 --> 00:48:17,800
The vault of heaven, full of the soft shining stars, stretched vast and fathomless above him.

575
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:21,921
The Milky Way ran in two pale streams from zenith to the horizon.

576
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,400
The white towers and the golden, that's a color, domes enfolded the earth.

577
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,481
The white tower against the sapphire sky.

578
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:35,041
The autumn flowers, that's how we know it was a warm autumn, in the garden were slumbering.

579
00:48:35,041 --> 00:48:38,000
The silence of the earth seemed to melt into the silence of the heavens.

580
00:48:38,001 --> 00:48:40,721
The mystery of earth was one with the mystery of the stars.

581
00:48:40,721 --> 00:48:49,361
If anybody's trying to track mystery, there's a clue, and I don't know what it means, that this is called a mystery.

582
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:53,601
But now, let me see if I'm just keeping up here.

583
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:06,161
Okay, so now we're in this total openness, and he's about to have the sort of the religious experience that she wants.

584
00:49:06,161 --> 00:49:08,721
But there's lots happening.

585
00:49:09,601 --> 00:49:14,241
He threw himself on the ground in despair at the beginning of this lecture, remember?

586
00:49:14,241 --> 00:49:23,520
And now he's going to throw himself on the ground in a new appreciation of something absolutely solid that supports him and so forth.

587
00:49:24,081 --> 00:49:36,800
It's somehow, this is where the earthy switches from being a bad thing, dirty, to being a good thing, something that sort of supports you and sustains you and that you should love.

588
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,641
And this is kind of an aside, but this is what happens next.

589
00:49:40,641 --> 00:49:42,320
Galiasha stood and gazed.

590
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,521
Then he threw himself on the earth.

591
00:49:45,681 --> 00:49:48,241
Maybe you could distinguish the earth from the ground in Russia.

592
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,440
He fell on the ground.

593
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,800
That was the dirty ground.

594
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,241
And now he's embracing the earth.

595
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,481
Russian consultant, please check.

596
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:05,401
He could not have told why he longed so irresistibly to kiss it, but he kissed it weeping and watering it with his tears, and he vowed to love it, to love it forever and ever.

597
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:07,480
We've got to come back later to the forever.

598
00:50:04,081 --> 00:50:10,920
Water the earth with the tears of your joy and love those tears.

599
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:14,361
His elder words echoed in his soul.

600
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,041
Why was he weeping?

601
00:50:16,041 --> 00:50:20,601
Okay, now comes the crucialest paragraph in the book.

602
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:24,601
If you're asking, sort of like her question, what's the experience?

603
00:50:24,601 --> 00:50:32,760
And the bigger question that goes with it, what is the sort of truth about the spiritual nature of the universe?

604
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,480
What is, in effect, God for Dostoevsky is coming up in the next paragraph.

605
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,161
So praise yourself.

606
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:46,521
Oh, in his rapture, he was weeping over those stars which were shining to him from the abyss of space, and he was not ashamed of the ecstasy.

607
00:50:46,521 --> 00:50:56,441
There seemed to be threads from all those innumerable worlds of God linking his soul to them, and his soul was trembling all over in contrast with other worlds.

608
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:05,640
Now, God turns out to be something like the field of connectedness of everything to everything.

609
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,880
Zosima says it's like an ocean.

610
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,280
I'll read you that passage in a minute.

611
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:19,800
But the basic experience, that's sort of the general field of agape love, and also the field of everybody being responsible for everybody.

612
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:23,641
Everybody is connected to everybody, whether they know it or not.

613
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:29,961
But when they experience it, like Alyasha did with Rushenka, it's a transforming thing.

614
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:35,880
Because that's, so I was going to say, as near as you come and getting in touch with God, but that's the wrong way to put it.

615
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,800
That is existentialized God in Dostoevsky.

616
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,561
There is no supreme being.

617
00:51:41,561 --> 00:51:43,881
There isn't any God the Father.

618
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:54,160
The universe has interconnected, and us being in touch with everything is the sort of sacredness of everything.

619
00:51:55,601 --> 00:52:01,841
If it may help you to see this, if you remember that for Kierkegaard, God is that all things are possible.

620
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:05,121
Remember, a sort of atmosphere, not an object.

621
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:23,601
These people are getting rid of a certain conception of God as a superbeing and making God into some kind of field of experience in which certain kinds of experiences become possible that aren't possible just in the natural world.

622
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:28,881
This is all supernatural, but it's not against the laws of physics and chemistry.

623
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:34,880
But it's certainly supernatural that there's an ocean of love and everything is connected to everything and we're part of it.

624
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,480
And when we find out, then we experience this love.

625
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,760
Let's go on.

626
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:44,241
He longed to forgive everyone and for everything and to beg forgiveness and for all men.

627
00:52:44,241 --> 00:52:47,441
And others are praying for me too, echoed in his soul.

628
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:52,960
And with every instant, well, I think I have to stop there to say more about that yet.

629
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,641
And then I'll read the last part.

630
00:52:54,641 --> 00:52:56,961
Okay, now let's see where we are.

631
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,041
So there are these threads connecting to other worlds.

632
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:03,280
I think that's on 366.

633
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,120
I don't see it on 366.

634
00:53:05,121 --> 00:53:06,161
Oh, I see, yes.

635
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,681
The section there is called Contact with Other Worlds.

636
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:17,441
I'm worrying about what are these other worlds that God is connecting everybody to.

637
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:32,321
And the and I think what's what's going on is you have to remember that where two people are gathered together, there is a world of living love, as Osimus says.

638
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,441
I think we have to find that.

639
00:53:33,681 --> 00:53:38,200
Because otherwise, just all these worlds, you don't know what they are.

640
00:53:38,521 --> 00:53:42,441
They're sort of any group of loving people.

641
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,441
Now I have to find it.

642
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,721
It's part of the Osima story.

643
00:53:47,721 --> 00:53:48,840
Probably I've written it down here.

644
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,681
Maybe if I just go on, I'll find it.

645
00:53:50,681 --> 00:53:52,441
367.

646
00:53:53,721 --> 00:53:54,280
Yeah.

647
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,121
Does anybody know where?

648
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,680
I mean, I want to see it just because.

649
00:53:59,001 --> 00:54:00,440
Oh, here it is, 370.

650
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:00,681
Right.

651
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,280
Through four lines down.

652
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:11,720
And if two of you are gathered together, then there is a whole world of love, of living love.

653
00:54:11,721 --> 00:54:13,080
That's the agape again.

654
00:54:13,081 --> 00:54:20,441
Embrace each other tenderly and praise God, for if only in you two, his truth has been fulfilled.

655
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:24,921
That is, connectedness of people to people.

656
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:42,280
Even if there's only two people connected, like again, Aliasha and Gushenka, the perfect example, each loving the other one and saving the other one, then, and all those connected worlds are connected in some way that people can move from one to another or they can recognize each other.

657
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,280
I don't really quite know how.

658
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,481
But it's all like an ocean, he says.

659
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,161
And that's what I want to read now.

660
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:51,881
367, yeah, at the bottom.

661
00:54:52,201 --> 00:54:55,400
This is Osima talking of what he learned from Markle.

662
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,720
My brother asked the birds to forgive him.

663
00:54:57,721 --> 00:54:59,640
That sounds senseless, but it was right.

664
00:54:59,641 --> 00:55:01,320
For all is like an ocean.

665
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,161
All is flowing and blending.

666
00:55:03,161 --> 00:55:07,320
A touch at one place sets up a movement at another, at the other end of the earth.

667
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:10,040
See, this is the interconnectedness story again.

668
00:55:10,041 --> 00:55:14,600
It may be senseless to beg forgiveness of the birds, but they are a little happier.

669
00:55:14,601 --> 00:55:21,680
And children and animals are happier if you yourself are noble and so forth.

670
00:55:17,081 --> 00:55:24,000
It's all like an ocean, I tell you.

671
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,361
Then, and so forth, that's enough.

672
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:34,960
And yeah, okay, now 370.

673
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,521
I'm just explaining the talk of other worlds.

674
00:55:37,521 --> 00:55:41,121
Okay, I got the people gathered together.

675
00:55:41,121 --> 00:55:53,840
If God is now, now, now for the rest of the time, and I just have enough time, I'd have to tell you sort of abstract philosophical, theological things about what's happening.

676
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,280
I started to tell you that.

677
00:55:55,280 --> 00:56:04,001
That there's no God the Father, there is no being, individual being, that you're supposed to be praying to.

678
00:56:04,001 --> 00:56:18,481
In fact, if there was some super individual being that was completely satisfying, that had agape love for you, and you had agape love for him, it would get you out of this connectedness into this just two.

679
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:26,400
It's the danger that you see between Zosima and Alyosha, where Alyosha gets too wrapped up in Zosima.

680
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,640
If there were a super god, everybody would be too wrapped up in the super god.

681
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:36,721
I mean, you're going to not really understand this unless you take Philosophy 7 and read Dante.

682
00:56:36,721 --> 00:56:43,521
Dante is the extreme of this version of there being a supreme being.

683
00:56:43,521 --> 00:56:46,001
And have I mentioned this before?

684
00:56:46,001 --> 00:56:50,081
Dante loves Beatrice with unconditional commitment.

685
00:56:50,081 --> 00:56:54,881
Dante's involved in politics in Florence, Italy, up to his neck.

686
00:56:54,880 --> 00:57:00,241
But when he finally sees God, the Supreme Being, he forgets Florence.

687
00:57:00,241 --> 00:57:01,680
He forgets Beatrice.

688
00:57:01,681 --> 00:57:04,440
He just stares into this incredible radiance.

689
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,280
Haven't I said that?

690
00:57:04,161 --> 00:57:07,721
Okay, I think I did once.

691
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:15,721
And the last line of the Divine Comedy is: Dante says, My will became one with the will that moved the sun and the other stars.

692
00:57:15,721 --> 00:57:17,561
That's exactly the view.

693
00:57:17,561 --> 00:57:19,880
Whoa, get this microphone back on.

694
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,481
I think I can do it.

695
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:26,361
That's exactly the view that people like Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky want to get rid of.

696
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:38,041
In my way of talking, that's the Christian taking over Platonic Greek or Aristotelian Greek beliefs about this Supreme Being.

697
00:57:38,601 --> 00:57:42,361
It's not, for Dostoevsky, it's not like that.

698
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:49,161
It's that there is this connectedness of everything is the bottom line.

699
00:57:51,081 --> 00:58:01,320
And it would only get in the way if there was a Supreme Being, because what's most important is the connectedness of everything to everything.

700
00:58:01,641 --> 00:58:03,800
And I've just tried to say that.

701
00:58:06,681 --> 00:58:09,161
We're going to get, where is it now?

702
00:58:09,161 --> 00:58:10,361
Just a second.

703
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:13,161
I went to a lot of trouble to collect a certain.

704
00:58:13,561 --> 00:58:14,280
Here they are.

705
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:14,760
Okay.

706
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:21,000
Now, there's a certain interesting loose end, but let me make sure that I've got where I want to be.

707
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:22,601
Then I'll tell you about it.

708
00:58:22,601 --> 00:58:26,921
Okay, we got to the contact with other worlds and the ocean and so forth.

709
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:34,681
Now, there is a certain symbol of the connectedness of everything, which is a very dangerous symbol.

710
00:58:34,681 --> 00:58:37,321
And it's fascinating what happens in here.

711
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:51,600
Plato, who's got this Supreme Being, which he calls the good, says that the good makes a kind of light in which everybody can see everybody and see everything, but even better would be to look at the source of the light.

712
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:58,401
So he tells a story about how the sun shines and makes everything visible and intelligible.

713
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:05,760
And then he tells this further story about how when you get really spiritual and religious, you can turn your eyes to the sun.

714
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,000
That's what Dante's got.

715
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,800
That's the Greek move in Plato.

716
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:14,561
That's the move that Dostoevsky's not going to make.

717
00:59:14,561 --> 00:59:18,321
But how he resists it is so interesting.

718
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:21,040
And maybe I'm making this all up now.

719
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:26,161
You have to consider the possibility that it's too clever by half.

720
00:59:26,161 --> 00:59:32,001
But I think it must be something that he's doing, whether he knows he's doing it or not.

721
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:34,561
We're back to the puzzle I set you.

722
00:59:34,561 --> 00:59:38,001
Why are the slanting rays of the sun so important?

723
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:47,441
Remember way back on page 17 when he's being squeezed by his mother, who's screaming and holding him up to the icon?

724
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,201
What does he remember?

725
00:59:49,521 --> 00:59:52,080
None of that, or barely that.

726
00:59:52,081 --> 00:59:55,680
The thing he remembers most are the slanting rays of the sun.

727
00:59:55,681 --> 01:00:00,640
On 17, he remembered one still summer evening, an open window, the slanting rays of the sun.

728
01:00:00,641 --> 01:00:03,280
He recalled this most vividly of all.

729
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,280
Now, why would he say that?

730
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,360
Well, you have a clue?

731
01:00:07,681 --> 01:00:08,800
Don't tell me yet.

732
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:18,321
But I mean, I'm going to show you all the places where whenever anybody gets in touch with the ultimate spiritual reality, it's by way of the slanting rays of the sun.

733
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:23,601
So let's, I spent some time this morning finding, I think, all of them, but if you find any more, let me know.

734
01:00:23,601 --> 01:00:33,601
On 27, see, if there was only one mention of the slanting ray there, I would just say, okay, so that's the most important in that particular experience.

735
01:00:33,601 --> 01:00:35,561
Don't make a big deal out of it.

736
01:00:35,561 --> 01:00:37,400
But I want to make a big deal out of it.

737
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:42,200
But if I had to get the right to make a big deal out of it, I better find a lot of places where it happens.

738
01:00:42,201 --> 01:00:46,601
Well, page 27, remember, I've read this already.

739
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:50,681
What gets him into the monastery are the slanting rays of the sun again.

740
01:00:50,681 --> 01:00:51,800
The three lines down.

741
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:55,881
Perhaps his memories of childhood brought back monastery.

742
01:00:55,880 --> 01:01:00,360
Perhaps the slanting sunlight, the holy image, and so forth and so forth.

743
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,521
But there's that slanting sunlight.

744
01:01:02,521 --> 01:01:09,401
Okay, and again on 329, here's Markle talking.

745
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,081
No, this is Osima remembering on the middle of 329.

746
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:16,600
I remember I went into his room when there was no one else there.

747
01:01:16,601 --> 01:01:17,640
It was a bright evening.

748
01:01:17,641 --> 01:01:18,681
The sun was setting.

749
01:01:18,681 --> 01:01:20,201
The whole room was lighted up.

750
01:01:20,201 --> 01:01:22,520
He beckoned me, and I went up to him.

751
01:01:22,521 --> 01:01:24,760
This is the passing on of Agape.

752
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:31,481
And he put his hands on my shoulders and looked into my face lovingly, and he said, Run and play now for me.

753
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:41,001
So just as the baptism of Alyasha was this together experience, and there were those slanting rays.

754
01:01:41,001 --> 01:01:46,121
So here is the passing on of love for Markle, and there are those slanting rays.

755
01:01:46,121 --> 01:01:51,800
And on 3:30, Zosima says what he thinks about the sunset.

756
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,681
What's he talking about here at the bottom?

757
01:01:54,681 --> 01:01:58,121
I remember first being moved to the devotional feast.

758
01:01:58,121 --> 01:01:59,400
It was a fine day.

759
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,081
I remember today.

760
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,641
This is how Zosima got into religion.

761
01:02:05,641 --> 01:02:08,521
Yeah, he's telling you the important memories in his life.

762
01:02:08,521 --> 01:02:10,440
And now, the bottom paragraph.

763
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,520
He says, My mother took me to Mass.

764
01:02:12,521 --> 01:02:15,321
I don't remember where my brother was at the time.

765
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,161
And now comes the usual.

766
01:02:17,161 --> 01:02:23,841
It was a fine day, and I remember as though I saw it now, how the incense rose from the censer and floated softly upwards.

767
01:02:24,161 --> 01:02:34,000
And overhead in the cupola, mingled in rising waves with the sunlight that streamed in from the little windows, those are the slanting rays of the sun again, not the sun.

768
01:02:34,001 --> 01:02:35,760
You beginning to see what's happening?

769
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:43,200
You never see the S-U-N, the sun, any more than you ever see God and Jesus, or at least God.

770
01:02:43,201 --> 01:02:45,360
Or yeah, you never see, never mind that.

771
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,360
I mean, it's complicated because you see Marvel.

772
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:50,321
But you don't see the Supreme Being.

773
01:02:50,561 --> 01:02:52,961
You see the light of the Sun all the time.

774
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,961
So it happens again on 332.

775
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,120
That must be where Zosima says what I want.

776
01:02:59,121 --> 01:02:59,600
Yes.

777
01:03:00,081 --> 01:03:05,520
Two-thirds of the way down, Zosima says, I bless the rising sun as before, my heart sings to it.

778
01:03:05,521 --> 01:03:07,361
Now, why not the sun at noon?

779
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,601
Plato loves the sun at noon.

780
01:03:09,601 --> 01:03:11,760
Even Nietzsche loves the sun at noon.

781
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:16,640
Dostoevsky only likes the sun when it's on the horizon and all you see are the rays.

782
01:03:16,641 --> 01:03:20,401
He says, But I now love its setting, its long slanting rays.

783
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:24,000
You just put slanting rays into Google, you find all these quotes.

784
01:03:24,001 --> 01:03:25,121
I just tried it.

785
01:03:25,121 --> 01:03:27,280
And that's probably all of them.

786
01:03:28,081 --> 01:03:34,321
But sometimes you find quotes, if you do that, where they're called God's rays, and that's fine.

787
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:37,121
But now, what's going on there?

788
01:03:38,081 --> 01:03:56,561
Well, I think, I mean, again, it sounds too clever by half, and I don't know whether Dostoevsky knows it consciously, but I think I made a case that somehow every time you're in touch with the ocean of love, and agape love is happening, the slanting rays of the sun are there.

789
01:03:56,641 --> 01:03:58,241
It's not the sun.

790
01:03:58,241 --> 01:04:03,840
Well, that is to say that it's the field of light, not the object.

791
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,161
Don't look at the sun.

792
01:04:05,721 --> 01:04:13,640
If you're living in the world, I mean, when I read Augustine, he's another one of the, of course, Greek-influenced ones who looks at the sun.

793
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:22,681
So Augustine thinks you live in this dark world, but up here is the Supreme Being, and Zap, you get that experience, and then you are saved.

794
01:04:22,681 --> 01:04:25,241
Dostoevsky, I think, thinks then you're doomed.

795
01:04:25,241 --> 01:04:28,280
You don't get the connectedness right.

796
01:04:28,601 --> 01:04:36,921
But when you get the connectedness right, then you have the rays and the light without the sun.

797
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:41,961
That's the existentializing move about God.

798
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:45,641
Now, I want to say one more thing just a second about that.

799
01:04:46,121 --> 01:04:48,120
Oh, yeah, it's the slanting rays.

800
01:04:48,121 --> 01:04:51,161
I really haven't talked about the slanting rays.

801
01:04:51,561 --> 01:04:53,401
Why the slanting rays?

802
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,480
Because that is the interconnectedness.

803
01:04:55,480 --> 01:05:03,641
I mean, instead of all of it going up like that, it's all the rays are going in all directions, slanting into each other.

804
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:11,000
That's the picture Dostoevsky has of the ocean of interconnectedness of everything.

805
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:15,321
Now, I think, let's see.

806
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,560
So, God's this field of involvement.

807
01:05:17,561 --> 01:05:25,001
Now, we've got to just look one more back to, where's this religious experience that I was talking about?

808
01:05:25,001 --> 01:05:26,520
Tell me what page.

809
01:05:27,241 --> 01:05:31,080
I want to go back to the one I was reading where he runs out.

810
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,000
Hell, you all must know.

811
01:05:33,001 --> 01:05:34,200
I'm not supposed to know.

812
01:05:34,201 --> 01:05:35,800
Here we are, 418.

813
01:05:35,801 --> 01:05:38,520
I'd have to read what's 419 now.

814
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:42,760
We're still sort of answering her question: What's the experience?

815
01:05:42,761 --> 01:05:52,560
So far, the experience is that you love the earth, then you water it with your tears, you feel an openness and a total connection to all the worlds of God.

816
01:05:52,640 --> 01:06:00,161
That is everywhere where anybody is loving anybody, you're loving them too, and they're loving you too in some very general way.

817
01:06:00,161 --> 01:06:01,520
And what does that do to him?

818
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,201
The top of 419.

819
01:06:03,201 --> 01:06:10,560
He felt clearly and as if it were tangibly that something firm and unshakable as the vault of heaven had entered into his soul.

820
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:13,520
It was as though some idea, that's a bad thing.

821
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,440
Let's hope the Russian doesn't say that.

822
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,560
Check on it.

823
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,760
I think this isn't where it needs to be, though.

824
01:06:19,761 --> 01:06:22,161
Okay, so it shouldn't be idea.

825
01:06:22,161 --> 01:06:26,320
It should be something more else, some notion or something.

826
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:32,880
Some notion had seized the sovereignty of his mind, and it was for all of his life and forever and ever.

827
01:06:32,881 --> 01:06:35,840
Now, what's the forever that's happening to him?

828
01:06:35,841 --> 01:06:37,121
You recognize it?

829
01:06:37,121 --> 01:06:38,960
Kierkegaard has it too.

830
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:57,520
They don't read each other, but they both somehow know that when you existentialize our spiritual tradition, you get rid of the Supreme Being, and you get rid of the eternity up here that Augustine and Dante think they get into.

831
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:01,121
And what do you get instead of this eternity?

832
01:07:01,121 --> 01:07:01,920
Remember?

833
01:07:01,921 --> 01:07:04,640
You get the eternal in time.

834
01:07:04,961 --> 01:07:10,960
You get the moment of unconditional commitment.

835
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,600
The instant that Kierkegaard talks about.

836
01:07:13,921 --> 01:07:26,081
The instant which is, instead of the moment, when you point up there, it's the moment in time which is going to determine your whole future as having it and your whole past as lacking it.

837
01:07:26,081 --> 01:07:29,040
Thus, yes, he's got the whole, the same picture.

838
01:07:29,041 --> 01:07:37,880
Only he, instead of saying that it's unconditional for him, it's always some other kind of moment of total human connectedness.

839
01:07:37,881 --> 01:07:45,241
His mother and the icon, the German doctor with the nuts thing, saying the baptism over him.

840
01:07:47,241 --> 01:07:50,121
And you don't even need one other person.

841
01:07:50,121 --> 01:07:54,280
Alyasha is falling on the ground in connection with everything.

842
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:58,121
He's got the experience of, that's your, then back to her question.

843
01:07:58,121 --> 01:07:59,640
That's the experience of God.

844
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,241
That's the ultimate experience.

845
01:08:01,241 --> 01:08:02,520
That's why it's in the middle of the book.

846
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:03,880
Everybody's in it.

847
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:09,400
But if you don't experience that you're in it, you're in despair, you're suffering.

848
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:13,640
But if you get it, he calls it the word to change it.

849
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:18,760
And that's your touch, that's what it is to be in touch with eternity, existentialized.

850
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:21,800
Oh, now we've got all the pieces, I think.

851
01:08:21,801 --> 01:08:23,400
Okay, yes.

852
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:28,040
I believe that's exactly what I want.

853
01:08:29,001 --> 01:08:34,360
Yeah, now, we've answered everything that we started with.

854
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:42,600
Of course, you need a miracle if in a crisis, the Grand Inquisitor is right, but it's not going to be a miracle.

855
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:45,880
And you can't believe just freely, like Jesus says.

856
01:08:45,881 --> 01:08:51,241
Even Alyasha, the hero of the book, can't keep his faith without a miracle.

857
01:08:51,241 --> 01:08:52,600
There are miracles.

858
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:57,720
They are always miracles of saving people through agape love.

859
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:59,400
We saw one with Grushenka.

860
01:08:59,961 --> 01:09:01,880
Keaton says it's a miracle.

861
01:09:01,881 --> 01:09:13,320
And once you've seen that kind of miracle, you then will be able to see the have the ultimate experience of being in touch with everybody at this level of the way the universe is set up.

862
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:15,001
And that's it.

863
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:21,201
Now, what we need for next time is, okay, that's how it happened to Alyasha.

864
01:09:22,081 --> 01:09:42,640
But somebody has to be the original person who got in touch with the universe, the ocean of love, and told people about it and showed them, point again, showed people what it's like to live once you're in touch with that ocean of love.

865
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,520
And who is that, of course, just repeating?

866
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:46,800
That's Markle.

867
01:09:46,801 --> 01:10:03,760
Markle goes crazy, and in his craziness, his brain fever that he gets from his tuberculosis, he gets a vision that is the vision of the connectedness and shows people how to live in it, shows them the God they love.

868
01:10:03,761 --> 01:10:05,760
I mean, so Markle is Jesus.

869
01:10:05,761 --> 01:10:08,320
Jesus was the one, according to this.

870
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:15,040
Now, this is demagicalized Satan and demagicalized incarnation.

871
01:10:15,041 --> 01:10:20,480
This love gets embodied in Markle, who shows it to everybody.

872
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,880
Or will he really only show it to Zosima?

873
01:10:23,041 --> 01:10:29,840
Shows it to Alyasha, who now is in a position to leave the monastery and show it to everybody.

874
01:10:29,841 --> 01:10:31,201
Ah, somebody's going to say something.

875
01:10:31,201 --> 01:10:32,161
Say something.

876
01:10:32,161 --> 01:10:33,760
Ah, I hadn't thought about it.

877
01:10:33,841 --> 01:10:34,480
Where's Markle?

878
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,280
Early on, isn't it?

879
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,921
Markle is in the remembering of Zosima.

880
01:10:37,921 --> 01:10:39,841
You're already past what you have to read for next time.

881
01:10:39,841 --> 01:10:40,960
I hate to tell you this.

882
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:41,600
Yeah.

883
01:10:42,081 --> 01:10:47,280
This is the existentializing of the afterlife, too.

884
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:49,920
Absolutely.

885
01:10:49,921 --> 01:10:50,560
Yeah.

886
01:10:51,201 --> 01:10:52,081
Okay, yes.

887
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,480
Beatrice asked a very important question.

888
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,041
Zosima contradicts a lot of what I've said.

889
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:03,880
Zosima even talks platonic, like, I couldn't find it in her, but I think he talks about sort of the supreme being.

890
01:11:03,881 --> 01:11:07,720
And he talks about a kind of eternity that you get after you die.

891
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:10,520
Gosima is not existentialized.

892
01:11:10,841 --> 01:11:12,840
He hasn't left the monastery.

893
01:11:12,841 --> 01:11:18,040
He's still talking Christian symbols about the existential experience.

894
01:11:18,041 --> 01:11:22,760
It's only when you leave the monastery that you don't need those symbols anymore.

895
01:11:23,081 --> 01:11:30,440
The way Alyasha ran out of the monastery and got in touch with this field, the ocean of love, Dosima hasn't done that.

896
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,121
Zosima can't do that.

897
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:35,880
So don't let it upset you, but mark it, because it's interesting.

898
01:11:35,881 --> 01:11:47,161
See if you can see how far Zosima is still in the traditional Greek infiltrated experiences and how much Zosima's out of it.

899
01:11:47,161 --> 01:11:48,520
I don't have a clear answer to that.

900
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:49,881
That'd be a good paper topic.

901
01:11:49,881 --> 01:11:51,320
Add it to the paper topic.

902
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:52,760
Okay, that's it.
