1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,800
The subject for today is the existentializing, that is, finding that in our human experience, that is what is grasped in the early church and in a kind of magical way as crucifixion and resurrection.

2
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:29,319
Those are big deal Christian symbols or whatever you want to call them, and they've certainly got to be explained.

3
00:00:29,319 --> 00:00:41,480
I think Dostoevsky's very good in general, on this very good period, in describing two kinds of crucifixion and resurrection.

4
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,879
You'll see, one of them is Dimitri and one of them is Yvonne, and he tells you so in his usual.

5
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,960
Uh-oh, I haven't turned this on.

6
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,839
Oh, I wouldn't be here.

7
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,759
So he wouldn't be hearing it if you hadn't.

8
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:55,559
Good point.

9
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,040
Okay, so we do the crucifixion.

10
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:10,279
He does really good contrast of two kinds of crucifixion: one kind that leads to a new life and resurrection, and one kind that leads to just plain madness and death.

11
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:34,120
What I don't think he does so well, and therefore I'm going to sort of condense it a lot, is explain why it's necessary for somebody to suffer for everybody, which is part of the Christian idea of the crucifixion of Jesus to somehow do something to make up for everybody's suffering.

12
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:40,519
I think that's a hopeless task to try to find an existential meaning for that.

13
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:47,559
But Dostoevsky bravely takes it on, and Dmitry supposedly sees it.

14
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:57,519
I'll mention it as we go, but if you haven't really been convinced or even understood what Dmitry is up to, don't worry about it.

15
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,120
So here we go.

16
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:08,719
So there is a kind of suffering with joy and a kind of suffering which is self-torture or self-torment.

17
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,759
That's a good translation, I'm told, by my Russian consultants.

18
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,200
Our translation, and almost all the translations, have other terms.

19
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,720
One of them is strains.

20
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,399
That doesn't sound right.

21
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,959
Another one is lacerations.

22
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,559
That sounds a little better.

23
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:28,400
We've got lacerations in the drawing room chapter, for instance.

24
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:47,040
But neither one of them seemed to me to convey very well that when somebody is suffering this something or other, it's because they are wallowing in their suffering and exaggerating their suffering and taking pride in their suffering.

25
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:56,399
And that's, so I may call it torment instead of lacerations, as I talk, if I think about it, because I think that helps convey what's going on.

26
00:02:56,399 --> 00:03:33,879
Now, another thing is important just to tell you, one of the interesting things that Dostoevsky does in many places, and I haven't really followed them out, I think they make possible paper topics too, is that Dostoevsky takes objections that people have to Christianity and doesn't say they're wrong, says there is such a bad kind of strain in Christianity, all right, but it's a mistaken way of Christianity's own self-understanding, and there's another right understanding.

27
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:42,360
One quick way to tell you about that, I didn't write it in my notes, but you can, the contrast between Father Ferrapont and Zosima would do.

28
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:53,160
I mean, you can go along and say Christianity is full of a kind of asceticism that denies the body and hates the body and hates the sensual and hates the world and so forth.

29
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:58,199
And Dostoevsky is not going to say there isn't any such kind of Christianity.

30
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,719
He says, yes, there is.

31
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,160
Here's an example.

32
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:08,199
It's quite repulsive and mad, but there's another kind of Christianity totally opposed to that and different.

33
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:10,360
And that's Zosima look at that.

34
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,079
That brings joy.

35
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:22,920
So if Nietzsche says, as he does, about Christianity that it's sick and masochistic, you'll see such quotes.

36
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:25,000
Nietzsche is not exactly wrong.

37
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:36,599
If you go to the big art galleries in Europe where you see lots of medieval paintings, you see lots of paintings of saints cut in half and burnt and full of arrows like porcupines and bleeding all over.

38
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:44,680
And that's a sick side of Christianity, the suffering of the martyrs, as if that was the most important message.

39
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,960
And so Dostoevsky doesn't deny the Nietzschean claim.

40
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:54,680
He just wants to say that's fine, but that's not what we're talking about.

41
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:03,160
We're talking about a kind of suffering which leads, which is which is life-affirming and leads to joyful life and connectedness.

42
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:10,439
The kind of the suffering that the bad kind leads to isolation and death.

43
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:26,559
So that now we're going to just follow that kind, the various kinds of suffering for the rest of the lecture today and see how each of them works out in the in Dostoevsky's existentialized version.

44
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,719
Oh, I forgot to pass down out, Beatrice.

45
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,999
We need to sign people up.

46
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:31,040
It's having an effect.

47
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,439
I am happy to see people I've never seen before in my life in the audience.

48
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:46,800
So you're all supposed to sign up because if you don't, we'll hold it against you if you're on a borderline, and if you do, it'll count for you.

49
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:55,439
This is my own, I think this is unfortunate, but it's my only way to make sure that I've got enough people to talk to that I can learn something and you can learn something.

50
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:55,840
Yeah.

51
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:56,960
Okay.

52
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,279
How many people didn't get who were here last time didn't get a chance to sign it?

53
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:07,680
Well, sign it and put and put parentheses last time also if you want to.

54
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,120
That's next time I'll pass around two of them.

55
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,439
But I think it almost worked.

56
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,559
No, you're the only one who said anyway that they didn't get it.

57
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:18,319
Okay, here we go now.

58
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:25,360
So just to keep your eyes on it, so there's the kind of crucifixion.

59
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,959
Being nailed to the cross, crucifixion is the way Jesus suffered.

60
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:39,360
So the kind of saving suffering that Jesus represents is always referred to as the cross in here.

61
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,960
Crucifixion literally means the nailed to a cross.

62
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,559
How many have seen the Passion movie?

63
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,680
It was just hottest thing when I taught this last time.

64
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:49,600
Well, it's still around, sort of.

65
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:57,920
You can always get the DVD if you want to see the the sick side of Christianity, the goriness of the suffering, as if that was the point.

66
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:58,800
I haven't seen them.

67
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,120
I'm protesting against the movie because I I think Dostoevsky would.

68
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:14,760
But if you want to see the suffering as the main point of the crucifixion with just a hint of resurrection at the end, then this is the movie to see.

69
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,559
I gather, reading about it and talking about it.

70
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:21,080
Since I haven't seen it, I'm not exactly an authority on it.

71
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,480
Okay, so let's see.

72
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:31,720
So we've got crucifixion, which is a redeeming kind of suffering and leads to resurrection.

73
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:48,999
That means Jesus doesn't die, but he goes to heaven, he arises from the cross, is resurrected, that means lifted up after he's crucified.

74
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:57,640
I tell you all this for some Christians, this will seem absolutely obvious and boring, but to other people I gather talking to people in office hours and so forth.

75
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:03,640
If it isn't your tradition, all this needs to be explained, and I'm trying to explain it.

76
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:17,640
So there is the kind of redeeming suffering which leads to the resurrection of being reborn, being in the language of the book, becoming a new man, becoming transformed.

77
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:23,320
That's what happens to Dmitry and leads to a joyful new life.

78
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:31,800
It happens to Dmitry, and of course, therefore, in a minimal, in a quick way, it also happens to Grushenka, as you'll see.

79
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,400
Now, there is a kind of suffering, that's masochistic and self-tormenting.

80
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:40,759
It also calls itself being crucified.

81
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:43,640
Ivan is talking about being crucified a lot.

82
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:57,760
And it leads to dying, and instead of, and rather than being reborn and resurrected, it always leads to spiritual death, and sometimes it leads to physical death.

83
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:05,200
Zosima, already way back on page 50, distinguishes the two kinds.

84
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,280
Here they are on page 50.

85
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,440
He's talking about peasant kind of suffering.

86
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:20,240
And he says at the bottom paragraph, there's a silent and long-suffering sorrow to be met with among the peasantry.

87
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,200
It withdraws into itself and is still.

88
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,200
But there is a grief that breaks out from the minute it bursts into tears and finds vent in wailing.

89
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,960
And from, yeah, this is particularly common among the women and so forth.

90
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:41,839
And in this kind of lamentation at the bottom is a laceration of the heart.

91
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,759
That's again the tormenting.

92
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:46,480
Such grief does not desire consolation.

93
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:55,759
This is a kind of grief that is sort of wallowing in its grief, feeling bad, feeling that there's such an outrage that they want to constantly cry out against it.

94
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,280
It feeds its bottom of 50 on the sense of its hopelessness.

95
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,400
Lamentations spring from the constant craving to reopen the wound.

96
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,360
See, that's why they say lacerations.

97
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,640
There is a wound.

98
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:19,600
So one of them is the grief, you get rid of the, you finally get out of the grief, but in the other one, you just stay in the grief.

99
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,399
So one of them leads only to more suffering, and the other leads to joy.

100
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,080
That's on 52, at the end of the top paragraph.

101
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:42,040
What he says to the mother of the child who dies, Know that your little one is surely before the throne of God, is rejoicing and happy and praying to God for you, and weep not, but rejoice.

102
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:54,040
Notice that Zosima is perfectly happy to talk in the totally magical or symbolic or whatever terms of institutional Christianity.

103
00:10:54,039 --> 00:11:03,080
But Alyasha, when he's asked about the afterlife way at the end of the book, won't say anything like that.

104
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,680
You'll see when we get there, he says, it's come along, it's time to eat pancakes.

105
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:18,840
But he's not going to promise things and describe things that go beyond the existential experiences that people actually have.

106
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:24,679
So at the bottom of 52, Zosima says to the woman, Consolation is not what you need.

107
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,919
Weep and be not consoled, but weep.

108
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:36,680
Only every time that you weep, be sure to remember your little son is one of the angels of God, and he looks down on you and sees your rejoice and rejoices at your tears.

109
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:41,320
And then, now comes the, this is the opposite of wallowing in your suffering.

110
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:48,920
And he says, a long time while yet you will keep that great mother's grief, but it will turn, and now comes into something like joy.

111
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,600
But it will turn in the end into quiet joy, and your bitter tears will be only tears of sorrow.

112
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:02,440
The bitter tears are the self-torturing period, tears, will be only tears of sorrow that purify the heart and deliver it from sin.

113
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:10,360
Whereas the other one is sort of protesting against death and the world and suffering, and it doesn't get purified.

114
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:17,800
And that's okay, so there it is already in the Zosima, but it gets spelled out a lot more later.

115
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:26,160
I wasn't going to read it, and I don't have it even, but I could say it sort of the epigraph from the book that I passed out to you.

116
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:28,159
You, none of you have it, I imagine, with you.

117
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:30,240
Some of you have other translations, though.

118
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,560
And you have the epigraph, don't you?

119
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,999
Yeah, will you read it?

120
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:42,399
I mean, because the epigraph from the whole book really says what I just said, but I realized just now that you don't have it.

121
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,960
Let's hear it.

122
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,160
You got it?

123
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:50,159
It's only one sentence, isn't it, from the Gospel of John?

124
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,840
No, not the whole introduction.

125
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:58,320
The Gospel of John says, well, if a grain of wheat falls on the ground, let me try it.

126
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,360
If a grain of wheat falls on the ground, it abideth alone.

127
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,360
But if something, what, if it, but if it dies?

128
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,720
If it dies, yeah, if it dies, it brings forth much fruit.

129
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:17,760
So that means there's a way of suffering and falling on the ground and dying to what?

130
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:26,320
Well, in the jargon of Christianity, the old Adam in you, the selfish, isolated what everybody is.

131
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:33,200
If you die to that, namely get rid of that, then you'll become a giving, joyful person.

132
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,680
That epigraph is exactly about this issue.

133
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:51,360
I don't know why Dostoevsky thinks that that issue, of all the many issues of the Incarnation and of Confession, and you'll see later, of eternity and so forth, why that issue is the one that gets an epigraph.

134
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,880
But the fact that it does is something to think about.

135
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,440
Maybe if you understand it, you write a paper about it and tell me about it.

136
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:20,440
So now we go on, and there is Dmitry the one who's going to be the one who falls on the ground and dies and suffers, that does it the right way, and is resurrected into a new being and to a joyful life.

137
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:33,880
And it starts already, of course, still with Zosima, who, as you remember, maybe it seems like years ago, bows down to Dmitry and explains later why he did it.

138
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:49,720
He bows down on 81, where at the bottom, Zosima rose from his seat and moved toward Dmitry and sank on his knees before him and deliberately bowed down at Dmitri's feet till his forehead touched the floor.

139
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,560
And why did he do that?

140
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:59,240
Well, we're told way back on 323, Dostoevsky expects you to have an amazing memory of what's going on.

141
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:08,999
He says to somebody, I don't, to Alyasha, in the middle of the page, I bowed down yesterday to the great suffering in store for him.

142
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:18,600
But not just the suffering, presumably, but the suffering and how he handles it, which is what's important, because there's great suffering in store for Ivan, too.

143
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,559
But it's the way Dmitry suffers that's important.

144
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,439
Grushenka understands that.

145
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:30,040
Again, you have to sort of keep so many things in mind.

146
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:44,679
Way on 590, when Dmitry sort of says that he's going to suffer the right way, because he feels guilt, whether or not he killed old Karamatsov, we're not going to tell you yet.

147
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,039
Dostoevsky doesn't tell you.

148
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,040
Whether or not he did, he certainly desired to.

149
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:53,280
And that's enough, remember, in the whole Christian way of thinking.

150
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,600
You are guilty for your desires, not just for what you do.

151
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,399
So Dmitry assumes the guilt of the death of Karamatsov.

152
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,760
He keeps saying he didn't do it.

153
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,999
Well, that's for you to wait and see.

154
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,879
But he certainly feels that he was ready to suffer for it.

155
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:11,120
He says two-thirds of the way down.

156
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,560
I accept the torture of accusation and my public shame.

157
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,919
I want to suffer, for by suffering I shall be purified.

158
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,600
Perhaps I shall be purified, gentlemen.

159
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,720
And listen for the last time.

160
00:16:20,719 --> 00:16:22,800
I'm not guilty for my father's blood.

161
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,279
I accept my punishment not because I killed him, but because I meant to kill him.

162
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,720
But so Dmitri, I didn't do what I was going to do.

163
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:33,439
I mean, that's what he says on the next page.

164
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:38,559
Grushenka sort of repeats the Zotsoma gesture.

165
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:44,639
Whenever Dmitri is about to suffer the right way, somebody needs to confirm it.

166
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,759
So two-thirds of the way down, Grushenka made a deep bow to Dmitry.

167
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:57,439
And that's enough to confirm what he's doing.

168
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:07,919
And she, too, and this is interesting and important, has amazing, I haven't written down the page number.

169
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,199
I can't believe it.

170
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,600
It's true.

171
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,840
I wonder where it is.

172
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:18,639
And she becomes a new woman in the same way that he has become a new man.

173
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:21,919
Maybe, have you no idea.

174
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,960
That's really annoying.

175
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,360
I doubt if any of you are so versed in this that you could find it.

176
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:36,679
There's a place where we're told that Grushenka has been sick for a while and almost died of sickness, and now she's recovered.

177
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,560
What?

178
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:38,920
650.

179
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,440
That sounds like about the right place.

180
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:41,639
How do you do that?

181
00:17:41,639 --> 00:17:43,320
You'd win an award if you did it.

182
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,439
Let's see.

183
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:46,360
Yes.

184
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,040
Terrific.

185
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,999
Thank you, Beatrice.

186
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,120
That's wonderful.

187
00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:53,320
I would have felt really unhappy if I didn't have that.

188
00:17:53,959 --> 00:18:02,279
Okay, so now Grushenka, as, of course, existential double, must also go through suffering and be purified.

189
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,639
And she does it in one paragraph, whereas Dmitry goes on doing it for chapters after chapter.

190
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:13,799
So now we skip from where she bows to him to 650, the second paragraph.

191
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:19,239
Three days after Dmitry's arrest, Grushenka was taken very ill and was ill for nearly five weeks.

192
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:21,559
She was unconscious and so forth.

193
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,639
Now, that's her kind of suffering.

194
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:28,840
She's sick, physically sick, but that's always in Dostoevsky, not the point.

195
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,239
The point is what that sickness means.

196
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:38,039
What that sickness means to us and Dostoevsky and to her is that she's going through some terrible suffering.

197
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:43,879
That's what's happening to her and what's happening to Dmitry, but she's going through it somehow in the right way.

198
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:48,600
She was very much changed, thinner and a little sallow, and so forth.

199
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:54,279
But to Alyasha, her face was even more attractive than before, and he liked to meet her eyes when he visited her.

200
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,719
Why is that important?

201
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:58,199
Why does Dostoevsky throw that in?

202
00:18:58,199 --> 00:19:00,120
Just to see if you're all with it.

203
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,519
You should all know by now.

204
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:02,920
Yeah.

205
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:06,760
That's right.

206
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,239
He was afraid to look at her and look down because he was so attracted by her.

207
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:21,679
But now he's got this agape love, which protects him completely from the Eros kind of uh desire he had for her, and therefore he can look at her and does.

208
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,039
And now what about her?

209
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:28,399
Well, she's an example, as I say in one paragraph, of what suffering can do for you.

210
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:31,999
A look of firmness and purpose had developed in her face.

211
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,720
There were signs of a spiritual transformation in her.

212
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:41,840
Well, as you can always be count on Dostoevsky to tell you what's going on, and you just have to keep your eyes open.

213
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,559
Okay, we're getting an example of that, spiritual transformation from suffering.

214
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,159
A steady, steadfast, fine, and humble determination.

215
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:58,320
There was a small vertical line between her brows, which gave her charming face, a look of concentrated thought.

216
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,239
There was scarcely a trace of her former frivolity.

217
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:09,679
She's not going to sort of play men off against each other and try to seduce Alyasha by jumping on his lap and so forth.

218
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,959
The new Grushenka doesn't do things like that.

219
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:17,199
The new Grushenka is full of love, but she's full of agape love.

220
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:20,239
Right now, it's all turned on Dimitri.

221
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:30,560
So now we're ready to go on and discuss Dimitri as crucified and resurrected.

222
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,120
Yeah, Beatrice.

223
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,799
They're transformed, but still they are very much in touch with Petita.

224
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,600
They quarrel, they're jealous, tried out to be a little bit of a powerful.

225
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,719
Yeah, it's true.

226
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,760
It takes a while to be transformed.

227
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,919
I think Dostoevsky's just being realistic and not sort of Pollyanna-ish.

228
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,280
I mean, you get being reborn, I think, is like falling in love.

229
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,800
It can happen instantly, and it does sometimes, and then people write songs and operas about it and so forth.

230
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,439
And sometimes it takes a long time.

231
00:20:59,439 --> 00:21:06,440
And you just get more and more into the being, the unconditional commitment.

232
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:12,279
Remember, I said that about Kierkegaard, the instant, which isn't really an instant.

233
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:17,080
It's that period in which you get transformed and you become another.

234
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,800
And it's a good point, Beatrice, and it doesn't happen instantly with Grushenka.

235
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,200
It does, I think, with Dmitry.

236
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:34,280
He stops being a living contradiction and becomes a savior of all of humanity.

237
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:39,800
It's a little hard to understand why he thinks all of humanity needs saving and why he thinks he can save it.

238
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:45,479
That's Dostoevsky trying hard to existentialize what Jesus was doing.

239
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:52,040
In Dmitry, I don't understand it, but he'll tell you again and again that's what he's doing.

240
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,680
You'll see.

241
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:59,000
I mean, there's no doubt that Dmitry is the, there are two Jesus figures.

242
00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:05,959
Dostoevsky has taken two very important Christian ideas apart.

243
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:27,879
One of them is the incarnation, that the whole meaning of the world as connected love gets embodied in, sort of breaks into the life of a human being, and that human being becomes the bearer of the news of the transformation of the world through love to everybody.

244
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:29,240
That's Markle.

245
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:44,600
It's Markle, it's the love channel through Markle, that's on the back of your chart, that is saving everyone in the book, because Markle is the Jesus figure as incarnation of God becoming flesh.

246
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:49,519
But then there's the God that gets crucified, that suffers for everyone.

247
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:53,439
That's Jesus too in going through being crucified.

248
00:22:54,719 --> 00:22:58,479
And that's the role that Dimitri plays.

249
00:22:58,479 --> 00:23:00,399
That's why they all bow to him.

250
00:23:00,399 --> 00:23:06,159
That's why he's the paradigm case of suffering.

251
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:16,799
Only I don't understand how he thinks his suffering is going to help the starving children and so forth, the people, all those unhappy human beings he dreams about.

252
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,600
And he's ready.

253
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,239
He says he's going to go and suffer for everyone.

254
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:27,840
I think it's a wonderful topic if you don't just repeat Dostoevsky or just repeat traditional Christianity.

255
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:43,999
If you existentialize how it needs to be that somebody suffers for everyone, how you go about suffering for everyone, and how suffering for everyone somehow fixes things that were bad before.

256
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,120
If you could explain that to me, that would be an A, and I would thank you every time I give the course.

257
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:57,919
I should thank a student already named Pamela Minkler, who 20 years ago or so told me what I'm telling you in the following.

258
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,679
I had no idea that suffering and crucifixion was part of the book.

259
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,280
I don't know how I could have missed it.

260
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:09,040
Now that I point it out to you, Dostoevsky is just hitting you over the head again and again, but I didn't notice.

261
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:16,080
And she said, there's this whole aspect of the book, the meaning of suffering, the right way to suffer, the wrong way to suffer, and you're just missing it.

262
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,199
And she's right.

263
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:19,679
And so I dedicate this lecture to her.

264
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:27,759
Now I'll dedicate one to whoever could tell me what, now that I've now that she's explained, that that's what's going on, I still don't understand what it means.

265
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,959
That is what the existential activity is, the way.

266
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:45,479
The way I can understand Markle, I mean, what he's doing and how he's channeling this love and how that love could save everybody in the world eventually, though it starts just in his living room.

267
00:24:45,879 --> 00:24:46,919
That makes sense.

268
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:52,919
I mean, I don't know whether I think it's going to happen or whether it's even plausible, but I can understand it.

269
00:24:53,479 --> 00:25:03,879
Okay, I wasn't going to go off on this sort of tangent, but it always bothers me that there is an aspect of the book that I can't understand because Dostoevsky gets everything so clear and so right.

270
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:05,879
Anyway, so let's go on.

271
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:12,519
Maybe something will just turn up, or maybe one of you will raise your hand like Pamela did once and fix it.

272
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,560
Okay, let's see.

273
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:26,439
So now we're going to do Dimitri as the crucified one, namely Jesus or the Dimitri, I think you understand, is to Jesus as Markle is to Jesus.

274
00:25:26,439 --> 00:25:34,039
They're the existential meaning of these important symbols.

275
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,959
Okay, so he's going to turn suffering into joy.

276
00:25:37,959 --> 00:25:40,039
He's going to become a new man.

277
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:46,840
And Dostoevsky's going to just tell you, clear as day, that that's what he's existentializing.

278
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:58,039
And Dimitri thinks that going to prison in Siberia is a kind of crucifixion and will lead to a kind of re of resurrection.

279
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:02,120
And I I'm not going to go into the detailed quotes.

280
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,039
They are you can look at them yourself.

281
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,360
They are scattered around.

282
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,399
I mean, I would look at them.

283
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,039
I haven't written them down because I decided I wasn't going to look at them.

284
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,799
Now I raise you.

285
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:21,600
Beatrice, where's the place where Dimitri is telling us that he's going to go to Siberia because he's crucified, in effect?

286
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,679
And he keeps using that language.

287
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:32,559
And there's going to be a hymn arising when he does, a hymn of joy from underground in Siberia.

288
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,320
It's probably somewhere in the Dimitri section, one would think.

289
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:43,120
If anybody has it, would yes, it goes with the dream about the babe.

290
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,320
Where's that?

291
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,399
Somebody, somebody else to what?

292
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,159
587.

293
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,439
Let's try it.

294
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:52,799
587.

295
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:54,080
No, but it's close.

296
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,879
Yes, yes.

297
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:56,479
Back to 590, though.

298
00:26:56,479 --> 00:27:00,159
That's probably it's right in there somewhere.

299
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,040
657.

300
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,159
Yeah, that didn't quite do it.

301
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,360
Let's try that.

302
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,759
He's going to go to Siberia.

303
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:15,679
But, yeah, but I mean, that's not the middle of the page, 657, okay.

304
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,439
He suddenly began talking of the babe.

305
00:27:17,439 --> 00:27:20,159
Yeah, that's the hungry child he dreams about.

306
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,600
And he's going to go to Siberia and so forth.

307
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,079
And he's crying and so forth.

308
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,280
That's not the one I had in mind, but that's the right one.

309
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,560
But he spells it out more.

310
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:41,439
He's going to be in Siberia with those prisoners, and we're all going to begin a hymn of praise and joy in our suffering because we take our suffering the right way.

311
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,040
Now that I've started on this, I have to find it.

312
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,039
I wasn't going to talk about it.

313
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,600
What?

314
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:50,399
Somebody yell if you find it.

315
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:54,159
Sooner or later, we'll find it, even if we have to read the whole book to do it.

316
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,680
Oh, let's hope, because I'm getting unhappy that I can't find it.

317
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,479
684, middle of the page.

318
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,399
Yes, that's good.

319
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,320
You got it.

320
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,759
Who gave me this?

321
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,199
Ah, thanks.

322
00:28:02,719 --> 00:28:07,560
Okay, let's look at it.

323
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:14,279
On 684, he says, Alyasha, these last two months I found in myself a new man.

324
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,840
A new man has arisen in me.

325
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,000
Christ arises from the cross.

326
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,879
That's the phrase.

327
00:28:19,879 --> 00:28:22,040
That's the clue, one of the clues.

328
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:27,080
And then he says, I go for all.

329
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,279
This is the part I don't understand, two-thirds of the way down.

330
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,399
I go for all because someone must go for all.

331
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:35,480
I didn't kill Father, but I've got to go.

332
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:36,439
Never mind that.

333
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,360
I can understand that because he feels guilty for his desires.

334
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:55,159
Oh, yes, we'll be in chains and there'll be no freedom, but he'll have joy and at the bottom, and we men underground will sing from the bowels of the earth a hymn to God with whom is joy, hail to God and his joy, and so forth.

335
00:28:55,159 --> 00:29:06,279
Okay, yes, that's what I wasn't going to read, but it's the right thing to read because that's the becoming a new man and being arising.

336
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:12,200
Jesus is buried because he dies on the cross, and then he is resurrected.

337
00:29:12,199 --> 00:29:19,479
That means he arises afterward, and that's the symbol that Dostoevsky is trying to explain here.

338
00:29:19,879 --> 00:29:27,320
I can understand that there could be a kind of suffering, and that that suffering can be purifying, and that it can lead to joy.

339
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,919
That's not the problem.

340
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:32,840
The problem is how one person can do it for everybody.

341
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:34,919
See, again, think about it.

342
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:50,879
Marco can do it for everybody, because agape love is contagious, and it gets passed on by laying on of hands from person to person, and then at the very end of the book, you'll see before next time it gets passed on to the boys by Alyasha.

343
00:29:51,120 --> 00:30:00,639
But how how can this kind of suffering be contagious so that somehow Dimitri can I just there's just no way to understand.

344
00:30:00,639 --> 00:30:01,199
I can't.

345
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:03,360
There's some piece I must be missing.

346
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,399
Anyway, back to this.

347
00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:06,719
I've got to stop obsessing about that.

348
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:13,920
So he regards his imprisonment in Siberia as a crucifixion and a resurrection.

349
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,879
That's what we've just discovered.

350
00:30:16,879 --> 00:30:32,800
And now the question is, can he hold on to that realization that there is a way of suffering that will bring joy to him and somehow to everybody?

351
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,879
I'll make this much generalization.

352
00:30:34,879 --> 00:30:41,199
There's a kind of suffering that will bring joy to him, and he is a kind of paradigm example of it.

353
00:30:41,199 --> 00:30:45,600
And anybody who could see it in him can copy it in him.

354
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,360
That may be the answer.

355
00:30:47,360 --> 00:31:02,320
Yeah, that's a kind, not a very exciting answer, but I think the picture is supposed to be he suffers, he does it the right way, he loves God in his suffering, he experiences joy, he starts this hymn, so all the other prisoners see it.

356
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:15,199
That's understandable, and they become joyful instead of grumpy, and grumpy is an understatement, you know, vicious and angry and full of hate for being stuck in Siberia.

357
00:31:15,199 --> 00:31:21,759
They get spiritually transformed, and then you have to make a little leap, but it's not absolutely unintelligible.

358
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:43,559
Other people imitate them, and other people imitate those people, and that's sort of a chain of suffering the right way, like the onion chain, only it's a little less convincing than passing on agape love, but you couldn't at least pass on an image of the right way to suffer.

359
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:52,679
And that's what the crucifixion has to be: that Jesus on the cross going through terrible suffering is not, it's interesting.

360
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:57,959
Dostoevsky has one reading of the Bible, but you had there are two on the cross.

361
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:59,879
Oh, that is fantastic.

362
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:14,519
What Dostoevsky does, it's a fact that in the Bible, three books of the Bible, Mark, Luke, and Matthew, have Jesus despairing on the cross and saying, God, why hast thou forsaken me?

363
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:27,159
And one, John, which is Dostoevsky's favorite, has Jesus affirming on the cross that he's done his job and he's not, he doesn't feel that he's been deserted by God.

364
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:29,400
He just says it is finished.

365
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:37,240
Well, but what happens is, I mean, I don't even know if Dostoevsky knows he's doing this, but what you get is both of those endings.

366
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:48,599
One of them is Yvonne, the one that suffers on the cross and despairs and dies in misery, almost.

367
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,759
I mean, Yvonne, we don't really, we're told that Yvonne looks like he's going to die.

368
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:54,360
We are never told that he dies.

369
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:57,720
But he's off to be, he looks like he's about to die.

370
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:08,920
What's the despairing result of being crucified, that is, of suffering, when you don't, and not accepting it, just as he doesn't accept it in the rebellion chapter.

371
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:23,999
And then we get another crucifixion where the person does accept it and is transformed spiritually by it and becomes an example for everybody in the world who can be transformed by suffering.

372
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:30,319
That's the ending of the Gospel of John crucifixion, and that's the one that Demetrius lived on.

373
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,439
That is interesting.

374
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,159
That's terrific.

375
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:42,479
I don't know if Dostoevsky knows or not that he's doing it, but I'll show you a place where he certainly knows that Yvonne is the one who is despairing on the cross.

376
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:43,759
We haven't got there yet.

377
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:44,080
Yeah.

378
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,719
Suffering supposed to be formed.

379
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,959
Yeah, yeah, I left that out because that is really incomprehensible.

380
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,360
That's what kept me from understanding anything.

381
00:33:53,359 --> 00:34:04,720
Because that picture, the picture of what's called vicarious suffering, that Jesus is suffering, can somehow suffer for other people's suffering and make up for it somehow.

382
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:09,520
I didn't talk about it because I don't think that I understood because I don't understand it.

383
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:33,600
But the way that Dostoevsky talks about it, thanks to whoever found the page, that page where it looks like one must suffer for all, he takes that Christian view that somebody can suffer, just somebody can suffer, I'll go next, somebody can suffer for everybody and turns it from there's a debt to be paid for Adam's fall.

384
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:40,479
This is the Christian view, and somehow somebody's got to be punished, and Jesus takes on the punishment and suffering for all of humanity.

385
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,479
That's the official Christian view.

386
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,159
Dostoevsky can't understand that, doesn't even buy that.

387
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,359
But he has to buy something else that does the same job existentially.

388
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,799
That's too much bookkeeping in heaven for Dostoevsky.

389
00:34:54,799 --> 00:34:58,080
And when he does, then we get the thing I just said.

390
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:04,519
There is somebody in the book who suffers exactly the right way, and everybody sees that and appreciates it.

391
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,120
Zostamus dies bows because he knows what's going to happen.

392
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,400
Grushenka bows because she sees it happening.

393
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:18,280
We all get to see it happening too as he goes off becoming a happy, spiritually transformed new man.

394
00:35:18,279 --> 00:35:19,159
Now, Chuck.

395
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,280
Becomplete people.

396
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:27,719
Do you think he's about very good?

397
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,480
Yeah, that's okay.

398
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,639
The ones he suffers an example, you mean they can see it and they can do it.

399
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:38,040
That's what I meant by this kind of contagion of exemplar.

400
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,040
Yeah, but that's not what he's talking about.

401
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,399
That doesn't get the faith.

402
00:35:42,279 --> 00:35:49,159
It isn't as if Demetrius takes on the suffering for all of humanity and pays some kind of debt that all of humanity owes for having fallen.

403
00:35:49,319 --> 00:35:53,480
Dostoevsky just thinks that's too magical for him to handle.

404
00:35:53,799 --> 00:35:55,400
You want to say something?

405
00:35:56,359 --> 00:35:57,319
Okay, let her start.

406
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:57,880
Yeah.

407
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:03,799
I think another example of that is, you know, bringing his cold down his food.

408
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,799
Well, wait, let's wait till next time.

409
00:36:05,799 --> 00:36:07,159
But I already say this to you.

410
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:08,120
Think about it.

411
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,399
I don't think Alyosha takes on the suffering.

412
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,400
I don't think he has to suffer.

413
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,120
What?

414
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:16,600
Ilusha.

415
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:18,759
Ilusha takes on the suffering.

416
00:36:19,799 --> 00:36:24,920
Ilusha suffers and is transformed.

417
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:27,959
But keep your eyes open when you read the end of the book.

418
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:29,399
I'd have to go back and look.

419
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,599
You keep your eyes open.

420
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:36,120
Is Ilusha suffering does that transform Ilusha?

421
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,880
My hunch is no.

422
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:47,839
He's an innocent sufferer, and he's and he doesn't show how you can be.

423
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:50,319
I don't think he's spiritually transformed.

424
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:59,439
I think he just suffers without getting angry at God or anybody, and he dies contented, and that's it.

425
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:11,040
I mean, the question is: how much of the suffering showing that if you suffer, you get spiritually transformed and get a new kind of joy happens in the life of Ilusha?

426
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,400
I just don't remember.

427
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,439
Something transforms everything around him.

428
00:37:15,759 --> 00:37:21,199
I think their love of Ilusha transforms everyone around him.

429
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:24,080
I don't think that he transforms them.

430
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,480
So keep your eye open.

431
00:37:27,759 --> 00:37:30,159
You want to say something first, and then, yeah.

432
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,040
It could have been that book.

433
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,159
You can write that book.

434
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:35,760
I don't think that's in here.

435
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:46,400
Dimitri has gotten over the dark side already when he turns his lust for Grushenka into love of Grushenka.

436
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,519
And I don't know where.

437
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,519
And he gets this agape love.

438
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,280
Where does he get it from?

439
00:37:51,279 --> 00:37:54,879
Because he has it before he goes, before the trial, even.

440
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:02,560
The muckro sort of orgy seal, whatever, that big party, happens before the trial, right?

441
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,439
And so, and he's already got it, the love of Grushenka.

442
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,639
And they both have turned, accepted the bad side, remember?

443
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:10,800
She says we're good and bad, good and bad.

444
00:38:11,279 --> 00:38:14,320
But that's not the issue about Siberia.

445
00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:17,920
The issue about Siberia is that bad things happen to people.

446
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,639
People they love die, and they have to go to, and people go to prison, innocent, and so forth.

447
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:26,080
How do you deal with that kind of suffering, I think?

448
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:38,440
And Dimitri deals with that kind of suffering by accepting it as an appropriate punishment for his desire to kill his father, and that's okay.

449
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:50,199
And then he goes ahead and accepts it as somehow somebody has to go for all, and my suffering is somehow going to be sort of the model for all suffering.

450
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:52,440
That's getting to be a little strange.

451
00:38:52,440 --> 00:39:00,679
And then that is going to somehow make it possible for everybody to suffer the right way, because they have an example.

452
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:03,159
That's, I think, what's going on.

453
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:10,199
I'm not going to tell you more, but I think it's great to have this conversation because when you read it, you can try to see for yourselves what's going on there.

454
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:17,240
And if you figure it out more than I've just, if you only figure out what I just said, don't write a paper because you are, one, it isn't all that smart.

455
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:19,159
And two, I already said it.

456
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:24,360
But if you can really make more sense of it, then you should definitely, definitely write it up.

457
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,719
I saw another hand.

458
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:26,040
Yeah.

459
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:29,879
Because we were showing throwing stones and yes.

460
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,120
But I, you know, here, good that you said that.

461
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:38,440
She says, couldn't Alicia have been transformed because he's throwing stones and now he's being loving with everybody?

462
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,720
Absolutely.

463
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:42,679
But now the question is, what transformed him?

464
00:39:42,679 --> 00:40:09,159
And I want to say not his suffering, his TB, or I think is what he's dying of, but that Alyasha loved him and affirmed him in spite of the fact that he bit Alyasha's finger to the bone and gave an example to all the boys that no matter how sort of resentful and unpleasant Alicia had become, that you could affirm him anyway, and then he became nicer, and they became nicer.

465
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:11,000
I think that's supposed to be the story.

466
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,799
So it's the agape love chain, the onion chain.

467
00:40:15,799 --> 00:40:19,040
Alicia, is Alicia in my chart of the onion chain?

468
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,719
He should be.

469
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,279
Yeah?

470
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:22,639
Okay.

471
00:40:23,279 --> 00:40:23,839
Okay, yeah.

472
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:28,399
So maybe this is his chance.

473
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:28,960
Who?

474
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,999
Alicia?

475
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:31,600
Dimitri.

476
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:33,040
Dimitri?

477
00:40:33,759 --> 00:40:36,719
A way of saying this is something that I should do.

478
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,199
Well, fine.

479
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:42,239
And if he just stopped with that, that would be fine.

480
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:55,840
Here's what I can do to make up for my past bad things with what's her name, the girl, Dimitri Yvonne's girlfriend?

481
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,359
Katerina.

482
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:04,800
Okay, anyway, the bad way I treated her and the bad way I treated other women and my bad desire to kill my father.

483
00:41:04,799 --> 00:41:11,520
I'm going to accept all this suffering as appropriate punishment to expiate all that.

484
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,040
Yes, he does that.

485
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,159
And maybe that's a model, I keep wanting to say.

486
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:18,159
But it's only this extreme Christian view.

487
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:24,000
Once he does it, nobody else has to suffer because Jesus did it for everybody.

488
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,319
There's some sense in which Dimitri doesn't do it for everybody.

489
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,159
They've all got to suffer their own suffering.

490
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:31,040
That's what I'm...

491
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,600
But he does show them the way to do it.

492
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,200
That's what you're saying, I think.

493
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:37,519
You don't look happy with my words in your mouth.

494
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,960
Okay, then let me go on.

495
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,000
By the way, I suddenly realized this is an immensely important moment.

496
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,440
This is an illustration.

497
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,639
I'm thinking, why are we having this interesting discussion today?

498
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:53,679
And why are we learning things as I talk?

499
00:41:53,679 --> 00:42:01,120
That's because there's about 30% more students in front of me than there are contributing to the discussion than before.

500
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:05,239
And that's because I stopped letting people just go off and listen to podcasts.

501
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:07,480
I feel that I've been vindicated.

502
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:08,919
Thank you for coming.

503
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:11,159
It makes a big difference.

504
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:15,800
Okay, now let's go on because we do have lots to cover.

505
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,760
Now comes Rakitin.

506
00:42:18,759 --> 00:42:31,800
So there's going to be, Rakitin doesn't, of course, want Dmitry to get away with this marvelous example of the right way to suffer crucifixion and be resurrected.

507
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,480
And what does he do?

508
00:42:33,799 --> 00:42:42,679
Well, he comes in in his, well, there's one funny thing you have to see at Dostoevsky playing these little tricks.

509
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:46,840
Dimitri has been talking a lot to Rakitin lately.

510
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:51,399
And as Alyasha comes in to visit Rakitin, Rakitin is in prison now.

511
00:42:51,480 --> 00:43:06,120
He's trying to figure out whether he should let them send him to Siberia or escape and go to America, whether America is worse or less bad than Siberia, and all those interesting but not big deal for us issues.

512
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,639
But here's the funny thing.

513
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:12,759
Alyasha comes to see him on 78 and see if you can figure out what's happening here.

514
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:14,839
It's just a trivial thing, but I love it.

515
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:22,120
As Alyasha entered the room, set aside for interviews, he came upon Rakitin, who was just saying goodbye to Dmitry.

516
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,639
They were both talking loudly.

517
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:27,159
Dimitri was laughing while Rakitin seemed to be grumbling.

518
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:30,760
Rakitin did not like meeting Alyasha, especially of late.

519
00:43:30,759 --> 00:43:33,479
He scarcely spoke to him and bowed to him stiffly.

520
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:41,480
Seeing Alyasha enter now, he frowned and looked away as though he were entirely absorbed in buttoning his big warm fur-trimmed coat.

521
00:43:41,799 --> 00:43:43,960
And what's going on there?

522
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,879
That Dostoevsky is sort of hitting you over the head with and having fun with.

523
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:56,560
Well, that's a kind of sort of archetypical, very characteristic encounter between the devil and the angel.

524
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,239
The angel has just come in and driven out the devil.

525
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,399
The coat thing is what's interesting.

526
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,359
Alyasha comes in over there, and Rakitin goes, that's putting on his coat.

527
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,760
You could see it in any painting.

528
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:15,759
And now, so the devil's been sort of scared away by the angel.

529
00:44:15,759 --> 00:44:17,200
And then what happens?

530
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:27,600
Well, now the next thing is that Dimitri, it turns out Dimitri's been, that Rakhitin has been trying to corrupt Dimitri, who's not all that bright.

531
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,120
It's not his job to be bright.

532
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,120
Ivan is the bright one.

533
00:44:31,279 --> 00:44:35,039
He's telling him about the discovery of neurons.

534
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,480
This is just amazing.

535
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:43,120
Somebody, I forget who, who came up and talked to me about neurons at the end of about three lectures back.

536
00:44:43,120 --> 00:45:03,279
When I was talking about, do you, okay, when I was talking about how that Dostoevsky is trying to show that the Christian stuff doesn't, gets existentialized and then doesn't conflict with laws of physics and chemistry.

537
00:45:03,279 --> 00:45:06,080
That's one of the rules of the book.

538
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:10,879
And now, wow, this guy has discovered neurons in Paris.

539
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:24,320
And as soon as that happens, Rakitin draws the conclusion that that just shows that we're material beings, just like animals, and what we do is caused by the firing of the neurons in our brain.

540
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:36,520
And so the whole issue of spiritual suffering and transformation and resurrection is just sort of thrown out the window.

541
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:39,719
And that's what Rakitin's been telling Dimitri.

542
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:54,840
And at the bottom of 680, poor Dimitri is trying to explain to Alyasha why this means that he shouldn't, that God is dead, that we're all just material things, and we'll just all have to become natural about it.

543
00:45:54,839 --> 00:46:01,399
At the bottom of 680, imagine inside, in the nerves, in the head, that these nerves, they're in the brain, damn them.

544
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:07,720
They're sort of little tails, and the tails begin to quiver, and then you see, and so forth and so forth.

545
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,120
And then a lot more details about it.

546
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:15,159
And at the end of that paragraph on 681, Rakitin explained it to me yesterday, and it bowled me over.

547
00:46:15,159 --> 00:46:17,399
It's wonderful, Alyasha, this science.

548
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,000
A new man arising.

549
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,280
That I understand, and yet I'm sorry to lose God.

550
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,399
That's a great thing.

551
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:26,519
So there are two views of what it is for a new man to be arising.

552
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:33,639
Dimitri's been meaning, by sacrifice, by suffering, you can become spiritually transformed and joyful.

553
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:36,120
And he calls that, that's the resurrection.

554
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:49,880
Now, the new man arising from the devil's point of view, Rakitin, is the new man is a completely chemical, physical organism, totally explainable by science.

555
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:55,240
And all this fancy existentialist talk just turns out to be irrelevant.

556
00:46:55,239 --> 00:46:58,439
And that's why Dimitri says, I'm sorry to lose God.

557
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:12,679
He understands that somehow or other, according to Rakitin, the neuron story undermines the existential story.

558
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,719
But Alyasha, and how does Alyasha answer it?

559
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,200
I don't want to get ahead of where I was supposed to be.

560
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:23,280
680, okay, that's right.

561
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:27,760
Okay, and now, what does Dostoevsky think about this?

562
00:47:27,759 --> 00:47:30,000
And then what does Alyasha do about this?

563
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:39,439
Well, what Dostoevsky thinks about it, he doesn't tell you, because this isn't a philosophy paper, that you can tell what he thinks about it from what happens.

564
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,960
But I'll tell you what he thinks.

565
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:51,920
He thinks that, of course, there has to be some causal basis for seeing and thinking and suffering and having transformation experiences.

566
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,760
But you can't, that doesn't mean that those experiences aren't real.

567
00:47:55,759 --> 00:48:00,399
It's just, it's as if you could say, well, you're not really seeing in the light in the room.

568
00:48:00,799 --> 00:48:06,639
That's really radiation hitting your retina and stimulating the visual cortex.

569
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:15,280
Well, of course lights hitting waves are coming into the retina, and of course they're stimulating the visual cortex, but that doesn't mean that you're not conscious and you're not seeing.

570
00:48:15,279 --> 00:48:18,960
That's the causal basis of this phenomenon.

571
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:28,400
And so it's the causal basis of the suffering phenomena and the freedom to do evil and to repent and so forth.

572
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,320
And now, how does Alyasha handle it?

573
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:33,199
Well, it's funny.

574
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:35,199
He simply ignores Dimitri.

575
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:40,639
All he says about, when he says that, I'm sorry, I'm losing God.

576
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:44,319
And Alyasha says, he says, and yet I'm sorry to lose God.

577
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:47,919
And Alyasha says, well, that's a good thing anyway, said Alyasha.

578
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,600
And he goes on, I'm sorry to lose God.

579
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,879
It's chemistry, Alyasha.

580
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,359
Chemistry.

581
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:52,399
There's no help for it.

582
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,839
Rakitin dislikes God.

583
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:55,040
Boy, does he dislike him?

584
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,480
And he goes on and on.

585
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:02,639
And then Alyasha just completely ignores him.

586
00:49:02,759 --> 00:49:13,159
And then he says, Dmitry pulled out his piece of paper from his pocket and he says, and it has some philosophical jargon in it.

587
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:14,520
He doesn't understand it.

588
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,080
And Alyasha says, I don't understand it.

589
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:24,519
But, and now he's giving sort of Marxist things about how the environment determines people and so forth.

590
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,159
But finally, he just lets him go on like that.

591
00:49:27,159 --> 00:49:28,840
He doesn't try to answer him.

592
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:40,199
And at the bottom of 683, he says, he just sort of breaks in and he says at the bottom, Dmitri, I can't stay long, Alyasha said.

593
00:49:40,279 --> 00:49:42,120
Tomorrow will be a great and awful day for you.

594
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,959
The judgment of God will be accomplished.

595
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:44,919
I'm amazed at you.

596
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,480
You walk about here talking, and I don't know what.

597
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:51,159
Namely, neurons and Marxism is what he's talking.

598
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:56,200
And he just changes the subject.

599
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,040
Let's see.

600
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,359
And then what happens with Dmitry?

601
00:50:00,359 --> 00:50:02,199
He went up to Alyasha and embraced him.

602
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:03,159
His eyes glowed.

603
00:50:03,159 --> 00:50:09,560
Rakitin wouldn't understand, he began in a sort of exaltation, but you'll understand it, and that's why I was thirsting for you.

604
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:13,960
And then he tells him again, was it 684 that we were reading before?

605
00:50:14,279 --> 00:50:21,239
Because we're back now to the top of the page, Alyasha, these two months I found a new man in me, a new man has risen up in me, and so forth.

606
00:50:21,239 --> 00:50:37,479
Alyasha just changes the subject from the causal neuron level and the causal material conditions, that's the sort of Marxist level, to the existential issue for the person who's having the experiences.

607
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:45,800
That's the existential phenomenological level where the courses I teach are, and Dostoevsky is.

608
00:50:45,799 --> 00:50:57,200
And that's just how he goes back to Dimitri talking just like a Christian on 684, and that just gets rid of Rakitin and the Rakitin problem.

609
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:03,679
And it goes back to the other new man, the new man that arises from the suffering.

610
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:06,719
And that's what he talks about on 684.

611
00:51:07,759 --> 00:51:14,639
And he's just driving the point home when he says that a new man has arisen in me.

612
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:20,240
I mean, if you hear that sort of with Christian resonance, that it says, I've been resurrected.

613
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:21,600
I am the resurrection.

614
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,320
That's what Dimitri is saying.

615
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:27,039
Okay, for Dimitri.

616
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,800
Now, we've got a lot to cover.

617
00:51:28,799 --> 00:51:29,999
So I'm going on.

618
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,480
We still have time to do some more.

619
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,720
And now we're going to do Yvonne.

620
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,120
Yvonne is a masochistic.

621
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,919
I got, my title is nice.

622
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,239
Yvonne's masochistic martyrdom as a parody of crucifixion.

623
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:47,280
That's what we're going to get next.

624
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:49,919
But now, oh, I forgot.

625
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,000
No, I didn't forget because I wrote it down.

626
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,239
I can't resist these little touches that Dostoevsky puts in.

627
00:51:56,239 --> 00:52:01,919
They're just too much for, let me like, what did I just give you one?

628
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,359
I can't remember already.

629
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,400
What was it?

630
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:07,519
Yeah, okay.

631
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:15,040
Here's a, now, here, before we switch to Yvonne, I'm sorry, I put it a little ahead of your Yvonne if you're taking notes.

632
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:22,399
Here's the last word, in a funny way, on Dimitri as a crucified one.

633
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,520
No, we've had the last word, sorry, of Dimitri as a crucified one.

634
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:30,079
The question is now we're switching to Yvonne as the crucified one.

635
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,839
He's going to be crucified the wrong way.

636
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:33,120
He's going to suffer the wrong way.

637
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:41,719
That is set up early in the book, just like the way Dimitri's suffering is set up early in the book by Zosima.

638
00:52:41,719 --> 00:52:44,120
But this one is set up in the weirdest way.

639
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,760
Here's what I'm going to read you in the middle of 301.

640
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:52,440
They've just had their conversation about lots of about life and so forth.

641
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,880
And now Yvonne's...

642
00:52:54,600 --> 00:53:06,840
This is right after the Grand Inquisitor story, right after Alyasha, the Grand Inquisitor, kisses the, sorry, Jesus kisses the Grand Inquisitor, but that's not what we're talking about.

643
00:53:06,839 --> 00:53:08,359
So here's 301.

644
00:53:08,359 --> 00:53:12,360
Yvonne turned suddenly and went his way without looking back.

645
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:19,159
It was just as Dimitri had left, left Alyasha the day before, though the parting had been very different.

646
00:53:19,159 --> 00:53:20,679
And now comes the funniest thing.

647
00:53:20,679 --> 00:53:26,920
The strange resemblance flashed like an arrow through Alyasha's mind in the distress and dejection of that moment.

648
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,480
He waited a little looking after his brother.

649
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:35,080
He noticed that Yvonne swayed as he walked and that his right shoulder was lower than his left.

650
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,239
What in the world is going on there?

651
00:53:37,239 --> 00:53:39,159
And why does he notice that?

652
00:53:39,159 --> 00:53:40,599
What does that mean?

653
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,879
I'm not going to tell you.

654
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,639
Somebody you've got to figure it out.

655
00:53:43,639 --> 00:53:44,359
Yeah.

656
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:46,200
Yes, exactly.

657
00:53:46,199 --> 00:53:47,880
He's carrying a cross.

658
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,760
He's Jesus crucified, Yvonne, too.

659
00:53:50,759 --> 00:53:52,679
And it reminds him of Dimitri.

660
00:53:52,679 --> 00:54:03,879
In that crazy paragraph, he's pulling together both Dimitri and Yvonne as carrying the cross, which is part of the crucifixion, which is part of the suffering story.

661
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:04,919
It just goes by.

662
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,399
I mean, nobody's going to see that.

663
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:16,040
But Dostoevsky sees that, because he knows what's going to happen, is he's going to put them together 500 pages later.

664
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:20,000
Okay, so now they're put together, and we're switching to Yvonne.

665
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:24,319
Yvonne is carrying some sort of cross.

666
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,239
That's why he walks that way.

667
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,440
And he's going to do it.

668
00:54:31,759 --> 00:54:32,960
He's going to confess.

669
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,840
It's now, what's he going to do at the trial?

670
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:39,920
He's going to confess that he's really the murderer.

671
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:51,840
And he says at the bottom of 755, lest we haven't got it from that funny par the thing where he's carrying it around, tomorrow the cross, but not the gallows.

672
00:54:51,839 --> 00:55:02,800
By that he means tomorrow he's going to take on himself the suffering of, and he's going to confess that it's his fault that old Taramasov died.

673
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:05,999
Don't believe anything I say in the sense of the plot.

674
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:16,159
The plot is so amazingly convoluted and strange that everybody gets blamed for the murder, but somebody actually has to do it, but I'm not going to tell you who until next time.

675
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:24,960
So anyway, okay, so he said now on 755, we get his view.

676
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,440
Well, we just did that of confession.

677
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,960
Now I've got to read something.

678
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:38,400
Yvonne's suffering, like Demetri's, comes from being responsible for the selfish impulses in him and his own evil desires.

679
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:50,800
But Yvonne's response is not to face the dark side of himself and ask forgiveness and take on a public punishment and punish himself and thereby that, but no, that period.

680
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:58,639
But Yvonne differently wants to punish himself and thereby show that he's better than everyone else.

681
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:15,800
That's the basic trouble with Yvonne, and probably Father Farah, and maybe all the masochistic martyrs from Dostoevsky's point of view, or some of them anyway, they were showing off, so to speak, by showing that they were how well they could suffer.

682
00:56:15,799 --> 00:56:21,639
You get it when Yvonne, again, Dostoevsky playing funny tricks.

683
00:56:21,639 --> 00:56:35,480
Yvonne, instead of explaining it about himself, because he doesn't see that his suffering is self-indulgent, self-tormenting, prideful kind of suffering.

684
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,639
But he sees it in Katerina.

685
00:56:38,279 --> 00:56:41,880
And this is what he says in the middle of 2:14.

686
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:52,040
He's describing Katerina, and to her, he says, Your life, Katerina, will be spent in painful brooding over your own feelings and your own heroism and your own suffering.

687
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:58,440
And in the end, that suffering will be softened and will pass into contemplation of the fulfillment of a bold and proud design.

688
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:03,880
See, he's turning the very words of Zosima about how suffering will be transformed.

689
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:07,320
But here, suffering is getting transformed into something prideful.

690
00:57:07,319 --> 00:57:14,120
Yes, proud it certainly is, and desperate in any case, despairing, of course, but a triumph for you.

691
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:22,360
And the consciousness of it will at last be a source of complete satisfaction and will make you resigned to everything else.

692
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:32,279
I mean, it's a kind of weird parody of Zosima's view about how suffering will finally make you mellow and make you, even in the end, joyful.

693
00:57:32,279 --> 00:57:37,159
But it's a proud kind of suffering, and, of course, it doesn't do that.

694
00:57:37,159 --> 00:57:46,679
And Yvonne, but that prepares us for Yvonne, who is an example of the proud kind of suffering.

695
00:57:46,679 --> 00:58:02,000
Instead of a infirming his involvement with the rest of humanity and accepting his punishment so as to be united with the rest of his fellow men, like the mysterious visitor does, Yvonne goes to confess to justify himself.

696
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:12,560
I mean, this is all, once you see it, obvious, but I didn't see it for years, so I assume you haven't seen it either in the swamp, all this book.

697
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:17,920
So he's jealous of Dimitri, that Dimitri could suffer the right way.

698
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,519
And he says, 758, I hate the monster.

699
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,799
I hate that monster.

700
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,319
I don't want to save the monster.

701
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:25,839
Let him rot in Siberia.

702
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:27,760
He's begun singing a hymn.

703
00:58:27,759 --> 00:58:31,440
Oh, tomorrow I'll go and stand before them and spit in their faces.

704
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:38,400
That is, he's going to go on, he's going to confess, he's going to justify himself.

705
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,359
I thought there was a quote that said he was going to justify himself.

706
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:44,000
I haven't committed it quite.

707
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:45,759
Maybe we'll find it yet.

708
00:58:45,759 --> 00:58:46,719
He surely is.

709
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,960
And we'll find out in just a minute.

710
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:56,400
In fact, right now, 757, the devil tells him what he's really up to.

711
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,479
And it's at the top paragraph, big paragraph.

712
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,079
No, the second big paragraph.

713
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,520
757.

714
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,280
Skip the first line.

715
00:59:05,279 --> 00:59:08,720
The devil says, you are going from pride, he says.

716
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:11,440
Yvonne is reporting what the devil says.

717
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:15,600
You'll stand up and say, it was I killed him, and why do you writhe with horror?

718
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,399
You are lying.

719
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,759
I despise your opinion.

720
00:59:17,759 --> 00:59:18,879
I despise your horror.

721
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,960
That's why he spits in their faces.

722
00:59:21,759 --> 00:59:23,040
He said that about me.

723
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,280
That is, the devil said it about Yvonne.

724
00:59:25,279 --> 00:59:29,679
And do you know you are longing for praise, the devil said.

725
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,280
Quote, the devil says, he is a criminal, a murderer, but what nobility?

726
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:37,000
He wanted to save his brother and he confessed.

727
00:59:37,319 --> 00:59:48,200
So that's certainly the wrong way to confess and take on suffering, so that you do something that everybody admires and you show that you're better than everybody else.

728
00:59:48,199 --> 00:59:49,799
That's how he's doing it.

729
00:59:50,759 --> 00:59:57,639
And he's jealous of Dimitri because he sees that that's not at all what Dimitri's doing.

730
00:59:57,639 --> 00:59:58,359
How are we doing?

731
00:59:58,359 --> 00:59:59,159
Oh, good, good.

732
00:59:59,159 --> 01:00:00,120
Just right.

733
01:00:00,839 --> 01:00:06,280
This is on 877, the bottom.

734
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,760
He talks about some hymn.

735
01:00:08,759 --> 01:00:09,479
She went on.

736
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:12,920
Katerina is now reporting on what Dimitri says.

737
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,040
She went on.

738
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,279
Some cross he has to bear.

739
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,879
The cross symbols are just hitting you over the head.

740
01:00:20,839 --> 01:00:23,800
At first, he was carrying the cross, now he's talking about it.

741
01:00:23,799 --> 01:00:26,040
The cross he has to bear, some duty.

742
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,599
I remember Yvonne told me a great deal about it.

743
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:33,080
And if you knew how he talked, Katerina cried suddenly with feelings she could not repress.

744
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:39,480
If you only knew how he loved that wretched man, that's Dimitri, at the moment and how he hated him at the same time.

745
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:49,799
And that's, of course, because he sees that Dimitri is suffering the right way and he admires it, but on the other hand, he hates it because he can't do it.

746
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:52,040
He's doing just the opposite.

747
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,519
So now that's clear, I think.

748
01:00:55,480 --> 01:01:05,960
And the kind of confession that he's going to make is only going to separate him more and more from human beings and isolate him more and more, not unite them.

749
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:11,159
I think I said this, but I'm not sure, so I'll go back and look.

750
01:01:11,159 --> 01:01:13,399
I hate the monster 750.

751
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,520
Yeah, okay.

752
01:01:14,839 --> 01:01:19,280
So his self-inflicted pain is motivated by pride.

753
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:22,320
So he's jealous of Dimitri, who does it another way.

754
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:30,320
They are suffering for the same crime, and they illustrate crucifixion, but in opposite ways.

755
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:37,200
They illustrate real suffering and self-torment out of pride.

756
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:49,440
Dimitri can turn suffering into a new life of joy by confessing and asking forgiveness and taking on sacrificial suffering, and Yvonne only creates more suffering.

757
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,120
So that's the two.

758
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:54,400
You won't really, I don't know whether I want to skip ahead or not.

759
01:01:54,719 --> 01:01:57,919
I think I will because I want you to see the end of it.

760
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:10,960
So what's going to happen when Dimitri is, sorry, when Yvonne confesses?

761
01:02:11,279 --> 01:02:13,679
Okay, so let's see if I have jumped there.

762
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,919
I'm not sure I can jump around it.

763
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:21,520
Yeah, what I'm doing is skipping the, trying to do this before I get to the part on the devil.

764
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:26,719
So what happens at the trial I want to talk about?

765
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:30,560
Yeah, it's all over the place.

766
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:31,600
I know where it is.

767
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,599
It's just I don't know how to get to it.

768
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,560
Who said what page?

769
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:38,479
Seven?

770
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:39,439
Probably.

771
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:40,639
That may be some of it.

772
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,840
I've got a different place, but let's see what you find.

773
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:47,359
Oh, yes, of course, but you jumped ahead.

774
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:48,879
That's exactly where it is.

775
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,040
But let me just lead to it.

776
01:02:51,040 --> 01:03:00,240
So, Yvonne goes into the trial, and he's suffering.

777
01:03:00,199 --> 01:03:03,000
Yes, 794.

778
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:04,279
What is 794?

779
01:03:04,279 --> 01:03:07,159
I'm trying to say that he's dying instead of being reborn.

780
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:07,879
Oh, no, I see.

781
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:10,520
Yeah, well, let's just jump to 794.

782
01:03:11,239 --> 01:03:13,639
Although, there's a place where it looks like he's dying.

783
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:14,759
Oh, here we are.

784
01:03:14,759 --> 01:03:19,880
Okay, now, having said all that, what happens when Yvonne finally gets a chance to confess?

785
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:24,679
Is he going to spit at everybody's face and tell them how much better he is?

786
01:03:24,679 --> 01:03:28,600
Yes, but it's killing him to do it, literally, killing him to do it.

787
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:37,000
At the bottom of 792, Yvonne walked up very slowly, looking at no one and with his head bowed as though plunged in gloomy thought.

788
01:03:37,319 --> 01:03:42,120
He was irreproachably dressed, but his face made a painful impression on me at least.

789
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:44,679
That's the narrator, who oddly enough comes back in.

790
01:03:44,679 --> 01:03:48,520
The narrator's been gone for about 500 pages, but it doesn't mean anything.

791
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:52,200
It's just Dostoevsky doing what he wants to say.

792
01:03:52,199 --> 01:04:00,120
But he wants to say, and he wants to say it as a sort of objective fact from the outside, that Yvonne is dying.

793
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:03,959
He was irreproachably dressed, but his face made a painful impression on me at least.

794
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:08,520
There was an earthy look in it, a look like a dying man.

795
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:17,880
So there he is going to the crucifixion where you do die, but he's dying in the wrong way because he's not going to be reborn.

796
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:20,519
But it's a kind of crucifixion.

797
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:24,840
This is where the 294, the 794 comes in.

798
01:04:27,159 --> 01:04:31,960
Yvonne's been talking about being crucified a lot, just like Dimitri.

799
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:48,240
But Dostoevsky playing his little game, in case you haven't realized that Yvonne is one of the kinds of Jesus on the cross, namely the kind of Jesus on the cross who despairs.

800
01:04:47,799 --> 01:04:50,239
You get at the bottom of 794.

801
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:57,120
He's talking and he's raving because he's crazy, and he says at the end of the paragraph, Have you any water?

802
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,040
Give me a drink for Christ's sake.

803
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,880
He suddenly clutched his head.

804
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:06,000
Well, those of you who know the Bible know that Jesus on the cross says, Give me a drink.

805
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:11,519
And then, oddly enough, saying for Christ's sake, that's just an incredibly crazy thing.

806
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:23,600
Yvonne never talks that way, but just to hit you over the head, Dostoevsky is saying, Look, I'm staging the crucifixion as it's done wrong, and that's and Yvonne is it.

807
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:37,120
And I don't remember now, somebody who knows the Bible well, does Jesus ask for a drink in all the Gospels or just in the three where he despairs and not in the Gospel of John?

808
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:41,040
Somebody look it up and tell me next time.

809
01:05:41,600 --> 01:06:00,639
Okay, here's the question: I would like in my new insight to think that the giving, asking for water and getting vinegar seen in the crucifixion goes with the despairing crucifixion where Jesus says, Why has God forsaken him?

810
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,879
And that that isn't in the Gospel of John, where everything goes very well.

811
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:09,200
I don't think he gets, asks for water and gets vinegar.

812
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:12,399
Please, somebody, will you tell me?

813
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:14,879
He does it in all four.

814
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,879
Okay, well, there goes that brilliant move.

815
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,639
Dostoevsky does it differently.

816
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,080
That's all I can say.

817
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:28,639
Dostoevsky puts it with the wrong kind of crucifixion and puts it with Yvonne.

818
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:34,279
And Dostoevsky is, you know, dividing up these existential insights in his own way.

819
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:38,519
Okay, now we've still got time to do one more thing, and we need every minute.

820
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:45,159
Then now we're ready for a new thing, and I'll set it up, but I won't start it.

821
01:06:45,159 --> 01:06:48,679
And that's Yvonne's encounter with the devil.

822
01:06:48,680 --> 01:07:04,199
Starting on his way home from talking to Smershakov, which I'm not going to talk about, but which you can look up, Yvonne encounters a drunken peasant singing a remarkably relevant song, 718.

823
01:07:04,199 --> 01:07:13,799
It's so remarkable that I'm amazed Dostoevsky does it because it's not in keeping with his kind of very realistic kind of world.

824
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:20,519
But when he hears, Ivan suddenly came upon a drunken peasant, 718, about eight lines down.

825
01:07:20,519 --> 01:07:31,319
He was wearing a coarse coat, and so would zigzag, grumbling, swearing to himself, and suddenly he began singing in a husky, drunken voice, Ah, Vanka's gone to Petersburg.

826
01:07:31,319 --> 01:07:33,639
I won't wait till he comes back.

827
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:36,120
Can you tell what that means?

828
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:40,199
Partly it's a plot thing, and you can't tell fully what it means.

829
01:07:40,199 --> 01:07:42,199
But who is Vanka?

830
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:45,239
Yvonne, remember, way back.

831
01:07:45,239 --> 01:07:49,159
Nobody calls him Vanka except his father occasionally.

832
01:07:49,479 --> 01:07:52,679
But that's his nickname, so to speak.

833
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:56,919
And what did he do the night of the murder?

834
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,719
He left town, right?

835
01:08:00,359 --> 01:08:04,759
And something happened, namely, the killing happened before he got back.

836
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,599
So Vanka's gone to Petersburg.

837
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:07,639
He didn't go to Petersburg.

838
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:09,159
He went to some neighboring town.

839
01:08:09,159 --> 01:08:11,159
I won't wait till he comes back.

840
01:08:11,159 --> 01:08:12,839
That is incredible.

841
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:20,319
That song is the story of Yvonne's, at least part of his implication in the crime.

842
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:27,919
Remember, Tatipu posted, he left town on the assumption that if he did, Dmitry would kill old Karamatsov.

843
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:31,439
And that's why he feels guilty of being the murderer.

844
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:33,199
And he can't stand being guilty.

845
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:34,479
So let's go on.

846
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:36,000
Skipping a line.

847
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:44,799
Yvonne felt an intense hatred for him, the peasant, before he had thought about him at all, suddenly realized his presence and felt an irresistible impulse to knock him down.

848
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:52,879
Well, what that means is that whenever anybody reminds Yvonne of his dark side, he wants to get rid of it and of them.

849
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:58,960
So now he wants to get rid of the peasant, who is in effect accusing him of at least accessory to the murder.

850
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:04,399
And he hits him, and the peasant stumbles against Yvonne.

851
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:12,080
Yvonne gives him a big push, he knocks him down, and at the end of that paragraph, Yvonne, he will freeze to death, thought Yvonne.

852
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,799
And he went on his way to Smerzhikov.

853
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:23,040
So now it turns out that Yvonne is sort of implicated in another sort of murder.

854
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,759
He doesn't try to save the peasant.

855
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:28,639
He just lets him die.

856
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:31,279
He says he'll die, and that's it.

857
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:43,759
Now, when he's coming back from Smershikov, he hits the peasant, he comes across the peasant on 732, and an amazing thing happens.

858
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:49,279
He feels pity for him, and he saves him on 732.

859
01:09:49,599 --> 01:09:50,719
Where is it?

860
01:09:50,960 --> 01:10:04,679
He's left Smerzhikov at the middle of 732, and now he suddenly, Yvonne feels that he's going to confess honestly.

861
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:06,679
The snowstorm was still raging.

862
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:12,599
He walked the first steps, and then he said, he's staggering at something physical, he thought with a grin.

863
01:10:12,599 --> 01:10:15,239
Something like joy was springing up in his heart.

864
01:10:15,239 --> 01:10:19,960
He was almost ready now to confess in the right way and be like Dmitri.

865
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:22,120
He was conscious of unbounded resolution.

866
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:26,919
He would make an end to the wavering that so tortured him of late, this torment.

867
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:30,040
His determination was taken, and it will all be changed.

868
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:31,960
That is his life, he thought.

869
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:35,399
At that moment, he stumbled against something and almost fell down, stopped short.

870
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:39,159
He saw at his feet the peasant he knocked down, still lying unconscious.

871
01:10:39,159 --> 01:10:41,159
Snow had almost covered his face.

872
01:10:41,159 --> 01:10:42,279
And look what happens.

873
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:44,359
Yvonne lifted him up in his arms.

874
01:10:44,359 --> 01:10:54,199
Yvonne, who is so distant and who doesn't care, and this sort of drunk-smelling peasant, he picks him up in his arms and he saves his life.

875
01:10:54,199 --> 01:11:01,559
And that is incredible that he looks like Yvonne is really on the way to being a good human being.

876
01:11:01,559 --> 01:11:04,439
And he's admitting his involvement with the world.

877
01:11:04,439 --> 01:11:08,679
He's trying to do something to make the world a better place.

878
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:14,199
And he's about, to do that, and he needs to go and confess.

879
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:27,159
And then he says, top of 733, the last thing I'm going to read, just as he reached his own house, he stopped short, asking himself suddenly if he'd not better go at once to the prosecutor and tell him everything.

880
01:11:27,159 --> 01:11:29,559
He decided the question quickly.

881
01:11:29,559 --> 01:11:32,759
Everything together tomorrow, he whispered to himself.

882
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:38,120
And strange to say, almost all his gladness and self-satisfaction passed in an instant.

883
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:39,799
What happened?

884
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,199
Well, it's a subtle Dostoevsky point.

885
01:11:42,199 --> 01:11:57,599
But Dostoevsky believes that when you do these Christian good deeds of agape love and of sacrificial suffering for the right way, you have to do them impulsively, recklessly, without reflection.

886
01:11:57,599 --> 01:12:03,439
Because if you start to reflect, if he starts to ask, well, when is the right time to go and confess?

887
01:12:03,439 --> 01:12:04,960
And should I really do it?

888
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,239
Or shouldn't I do it?

889
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:15,679
As soon as you start to deliberate, you fall back into the selfish, rational kind of human being that people normally are.

890
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:30,159
And so, Yvonne, the only way to accept responsibility for everybody and suffer rightly is to do it spontaneously, emotionally, impulsively, without reflection.

891
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:33,359
This is the sort of anti-Plato, anti-Socrates.

892
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:38,000
The best things people do in their life, they do without thinking at all.

893
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,519
They do without reflection.

894
01:12:39,519 --> 01:12:41,359
I'll tell you more about that in a minute.

895
01:12:41,599 --> 01:12:46,559
And the connectedness isn't rational and goes against our selfish nature.

896
01:12:46,559 --> 01:12:53,439
And we can only go against our selfish nature when we are sort of carried away impulsively and not rational.

897
01:12:53,439 --> 01:13:04,080
As soon as Yvonne loses his spontaneous resolution, then his conflict between pride and guilt returns in the form of a confrontation with the devil.

898
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,840
That's how far I wanted to get.

899
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,199
But I've got three more minutes.

900
01:13:07,279 --> 01:13:10,879
I'll start next time with the confrontation with the devil.

901
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:18,080
Which starts on 7, I'll start on 749, but you need to finish the book.

902
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:29,919
But I just want to tell you that this idea that people, this is sort of to protect you from what you learn in college, you learn to be rational, critical, reflective.

903
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,279
Don't stick into lower immediacy, do mediation.

904
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:37,319
You get it from Socrates, and it comes down to us.

905
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:43,880
But the best thing people do, Dostoevsky thinks, they don't do my thinking and calculating.

906
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:45,559
They do them impulsively.

907
01:13:45,559 --> 01:13:46,359
They have to.

908
01:13:46,359 --> 01:13:47,880
And I'm going to end with just the story.

909
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:56,199
You know, probably a lot of you do about the guy in New York in the New York subway when a guy fell on the tracks in front of the subway train.

910
01:13:56,199 --> 01:13:58,679
Any of you know that fact?

911
01:13:58,680 --> 01:13:59,639
You know about it.

912
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:24,199
Well, when this guy, about a 30-year-old guy, had some, I don't know what, epileptic fit or something, and fell on the tracks and the subway train was coming, somebody standing on the platform with his kids gave his kids to somebody, said, keep these, and jumped on the subway tracks on top of the guy who had fallen down, held him down, and the subway train went over them and nobody was hurt.

913
01:14:24,199 --> 01:14:28,920
And he became a hero and he was written up in all the papers in New York and interviewed.

914
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:31,800
And when he was interviewed, they asked him, sort of, why did you do it?

915
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:32,919
What were you thinking?

916
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:34,519
And he said, I didn't have time to think.

917
01:14:34,519 --> 01:14:35,960
I wasn't thinking at all.

918
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,319
It just had to be done.

919
01:14:37,319 --> 01:14:38,679
Somebody had to do it.

920
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:43,000
And they called on me, and I did it with a perfectly Dostoevsky thing.

921
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:48,359
I mean, that's a much more amazing hero or saint.

922
01:14:48,439 --> 01:14:49,880
Neither one of those is quite right.

923
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:55,880
A much more amazing human thing to do than stopping to figure out what to do.

924
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:58,439
Because, of course, in that case, the guy would have been dead.

925
01:14:58,439 --> 01:14:59,639
Okay, that's it.
