1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,321
Okay, so now I'm going to sort of try to situate the Nietzsche in in the context of its own time, namely our time, and in relation to Dostoevsky and to Kierkegaard.

2
00:00:19,641 --> 00:00:25,801
So and I will sort of be following my own notes here, so I better put them out in front of me.

3
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:32,280
So far we've studied what I think are the two greatest Christian thinkers of modern times.

4
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:42,760
That is, they both, Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky, and you know that, I hope, because I've been stressing it, try to save the deep truth of Christianity.

5
00:00:42,761 --> 00:00:45,401
They have very different ideas about what it is.

6
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:59,640
But whatever it is, they think it's what the early Christian community understood, and that they have to save it from a lot of bad Greek philosophical things that have happened to it.

7
00:00:59,801 --> 00:01:14,281
They want to save it from any kind of emphasis on reflection, detachment, theoretical thinking, all of which we owe to the Athenian Greeks, Plato and Aristotle and Socrates.

8
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:24,120
They want to save it from one God, the one supreme being.

9
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:40,521
Both Kierkegaard with his idea that God is, that all things are possible, and Nietzsche and Dostoevsky with his idea that God is the connectedness of all the worlds of interrelated loving people.

10
00:01:41,161 --> 00:02:05,520
Get rid of the Supreme Being and substitute some other something which in both cases has a special relation to Jesus who manifests the the right way to live in the field, really, a sort of field, a force field that is their view of God.

11
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:15,680
So another way to put it is that each of them, now sort of separating them, have their own sort of enemy.

12
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,921
The enemy in general is, as I say, Greek philosophy or just plain philosophy.

13
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:34,241
This goes back to my very first lecture, where the idea that somehow detached, theoretical way of being related to the world was the highest thing for the Greeks.

14
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:38,241
But it developed a lot over 2,000 years.

15
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:56,560
And when you get to Hegel, which is in the 1800s, that's the last attempt to give a kind of philosophical interpretation of Christianity, which says that it turns all of Christianity into philosophy.

16
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,680
Any part of Christianity that you can't turn into philosophy must just be superstition, and you could do without it, like a fairy tale.

17
00:03:06,481 --> 00:03:12,481
But part of Christianity contains deep truths, and Hegel claims to have them.

18
00:03:12,481 --> 00:03:15,921
And Kierkegaard claims that Hegel's missed them completely.

19
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:25,921
So the way Kierkegaard attacks the whole tradition is to be the generation after Hegel, where everybody's a Hegelian.

20
00:03:25,921 --> 00:03:45,161
And Kierkegaard, because of that, can see clearly that something very important is missing, namely involvement as higher than detachment, and unconditional commitment as something that you can't make rational or intelligible, but you can live.

21
00:03:45,481 --> 00:03:52,520
And if you live it right, you have the most fulfilling, blissful, meaningful life.

22
00:03:52,841 --> 00:04:02,200
Dostoevsky's enemies, he doesn't have Hegel to worry about, but it seems, I mean, you must have noticed it, and I've said it without saying it in so many words.

23
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,120
It's scientism.

24
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:11,560
I mean, it's natural science taken to be the explanation of how everything works, even the neurons.

25
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:27,801
He's so modern in that he sees the danger to everything meaningful and Judeo-Christian in the culture if everybody just becomes naturalist and thinks that all you need is to understand how the atoms bump into each other.

26
00:04:27,801 --> 00:05:00,281
And the other big enemy for Dostoevsky is European Enlightenment, the bad people in France and Germany who, following Hegel and Kierkegaard, and Kant, though Heidegger does, I'm getting all my names mixed up, though Dostoevsky doesn't name Kant and so forth, nonetheless, the Enlightenment idea that individuals ought to be autonomous.

27
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:11,481
They ought to give themselves their reasons for action and act after deliberation and act in a way that everybody can understand it because they do the universal thing.

28
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:25,321
This is again like what I was saying in the beginning, and they become self-sufficient and autonomous, or in Kant jargon, I don't know if I ever said this, the Enlightenment is human beings coming to maturity.

29
00:05:25,321 --> 00:05:31,761
They finally take over responsibility for all the meaning in the world and in their lives.

30
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:35,041
And they're both against that.

31
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,800
They both want to go back.

32
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,641
I've said this, but I'll say it again here because I want to bring in Pascal.

33
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:47,281
Like Pascal, who remember said the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is not the God of the philosophers.

34
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:56,481
They want to get the metaphysics and theology of the Greek philosophers, but also the German philosophers.

35
00:05:56,481 --> 00:06:05,041
The French didn't have any big deal contribution, I think, because they were copying the Germans, so they're certainly part of the Enlightenment.

36
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:24,321
Like Pascal, they want to purify the Judeo-Christian tradition by going back to the experience of the Hebrews and then the Christians, who had an entirely different understanding of what was important for human beings than the Greeks.

37
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:40,321
And Dostoevsky, therefore, wants to dump out of, get out of, take out of Christianity the kind of magic that he thinks happens if you don't existentialize all the symbols.

38
00:06:40,321 --> 00:06:52,081
And he wants to get out of it the Platonism, also Protestantism, even that kind of Christianity is already too isolated, too individual, too modern.

39
00:06:52,481 --> 00:06:58,481
And he wants to get out of it a kind of masochism, a kind of misunderstanding of suffering.

40
00:06:58,481 --> 00:07:04,880
All of that is going to get existentialized, as you saw in the brothers.

41
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:11,761
And then you will have left a kind of existential truth of a joyful life.

42
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:17,081
And that's, for Dostoevsky, how the early Christian community must have been.

43
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:25,321
Kierkegaard doesn't have, you see, it's sort of funny in between because he is a Protestant and he doesn't have a notion of community.

44
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:29,881
He has a notion of each person having their own individual unconditional commitment.

45
00:07:30,361 --> 00:07:42,281
From Dostoevsky's point of view, Kierkegaard would be part of the problem, although sort of a step in the right direction, at least trying to get rid of the Platonism.

46
00:07:42,601 --> 00:07:46,601
So, Nietzsche, however, now comes the big switch.

47
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:48,441
That's what you've been so far.

48
00:07:48,441 --> 00:07:58,201
It's been save the original Christian experience from science, from philosophy, from theology, and from Protestantism.

49
00:07:58,201 --> 00:08:00,280
And that's what they're up to.

50
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,281
Well, that's what Dostoevsky's up to.

51
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:06,041
Except for the Protestantism part, that's what Kierkegaard's up to.

52
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,561
But now, Nietzsche is one whole step more radical.

53
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:21,721
Because with Nietzsche, instead of getting the greatest Christians since the Enlightenment, Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky, we get the greatest anti-Christian.

54
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:45,161
He is, like a Christian, anti-Greek, anti-Socrates, and like Kierkegaard, that is, and Dostoevsky, anti-Greek, anti-Socrates, and Plato, but he rejects Christianity in its Platonized form, like they do, like Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky, but also as a way of life.

55
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,841
He's not at all interested in going back to the early Christian community.

56
00:08:48,841 --> 00:08:54,041
In fact, he thinks that we're sick, and it was sick from the very beginning.

57
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:59,760
There's a line we'll get to in the Twilight of the 20s.

58
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,201
What's the other one?

59
00:09:01,361 --> 00:09:07,281
The Antichrist, where he says that the only true Christian died on the cross.

60
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:18,081
That is, he has a lot of respect for Jesus, but he thinks that with Paul and with the Bible interpretation of Jesus, everything went wrong.

61
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,520
So now, that's the overall view.

62
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:27,841
We're switching to the big opponent of everything Judeo-Christian.

63
00:09:28,721 --> 00:09:31,201
And it's only, yeah.

64
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:35,040
And now, just to put this into, anybody want to say anything about that?

65
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:42,400
That's supposed to bring it so you see why these three people are in this course and how it relates to the first lecture.

66
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:45,841
Does anybody, I mean, I don't see anything controversial.

67
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:47,201
Good, somebody does, maybe.

68
00:09:47,201 --> 00:09:47,681
Yeah.

69
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:50,241
Ah, I thought somebody might ask that.

70
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:53,040
I don't want to talk about that until I get to the Antichrist.

71
00:09:53,921 --> 00:09:56,481
He makes Christ into his way of doing.

72
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,001
Yeah, let's wait.

73
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,280
But if I, for some strange reason, don't bring it up, ask me again.

74
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,681
But I expect to come to it not next time, but the time after.

75
00:10:09,681 --> 00:10:12,641
For next time, I'm glad that came up.

76
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:19,361
I want you to be sure and read, at least, I mean, the more you read of the assignment, the better.

77
00:10:20,081 --> 00:10:30,640
But what I'm going to talk about all the time, next time, is the part called The Madman, the center of the book.

78
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,040
I doubt if it's in the middle of the book.

79
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,921
Well, you'll find it, but I want to tell you.

80
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,521
110?

81
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,481
Okay.

82
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,041
You're always finding these things.

83
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:42,361
I see.

84
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:46,601
Not page 110, but yes, that's right.

85
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:49,800
What I'm going to talk about, no, not quite 110.

86
00:10:50,841 --> 00:10:52,201
Page or aphorism?

87
00:10:53,081 --> 00:10:54,440
Page 110.

88
00:10:54,441 --> 00:10:55,161
Yes.

89
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,641
So I want you to be sure and read.

90
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,081
I'll write it on the board.

91
00:10:59,081 --> 00:11:02,441
You read page 181 to.

92
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,241
Well, that's the point.

93
00:11:06,441 --> 00:11:07,321
What?

94
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,241
We're reading.

95
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:13,641
Right now we're reading The Twilight of the Idols, which looks like that.

96
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:19,481
But next time, if I finish The Twilight of the Idols today, which I see.

97
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:31,641
Well, my hunch is I'm going to finish The Twilight of the Idols today, and we're going to talk about the madman, namely the death of God, on Thursday, not next week.

98
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:34,040
But there's a lot to read in here.

99
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,481
But I need a whole lecture on the madman.

100
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:43,400
And so I'm going to, and that's why I want to make sure you read it.

101
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,000
So you read the gay science.

102
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,761
We'll see by the end of today where I am.

103
00:11:49,081 --> 00:11:51,000
But then we'll know whether you're going to.

104
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,841
181.

105
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,041
Okay.

106
00:11:54,361 --> 00:11:57,400
And that's right now that's for Thursday.

107
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:57,801
Now.

108
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,961
Yeah, Beatrice.

109
00:11:59,961 --> 00:12:02,120
Yeah, I thought of putting in Descartes.

110
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,361
That's the beginning of modernity.

111
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:06,601
It comes in two stages.

112
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:19,481
Descartes and Luther already, together, each in their own very different way, say that the individual is most important and has a direct relation to God.

113
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,760
Luther is most interested in the direct relation to God.

114
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:35,441
Descartes is interested in that every individual is self-sufficient and is able to decide for themselves what's true and false and what a good life is and live it and so forth.

115
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:46,080
And then it's after Descartes, it takes Kant to go and see that if you follow Descartes, you put man in the center of the world.

116
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:48,481
You don't even have to have God anymore.

117
00:12:48,481 --> 00:12:52,641
Kant still has God, but in a very peripheral way.

118
00:12:52,640 --> 00:13:08,081
And Kant draws the conclusion that's already sort of implicit in Descartes, and namely that self-sufficient human beings are rational and are able to control their lives and give meaning to their lives and give meaning to the world.

119
00:13:08,081 --> 00:13:09,601
All that should sound very familiar.

120
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:10,721
You're still in it.

121
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:17,120
Then we get the name for that that Descartes didn't have, the Enlightenment.

122
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:24,961
And we get Kant's explanation of that, namely that's what human beings really are, and now they've reached maturity, they understand it.

123
00:13:24,961 --> 00:13:31,281
And when you're mature, I'll add one thing: you see that you're not like a child anymore with some authority over you.

124
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:36,320
So you no longer recognize the authority of the Pope or of the King.

125
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,241
You are the authority.

126
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:39,361
You get to decide.

127
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,640
You have to decide what's true and what's false and what's right and what's wrong.

128
00:13:44,641 --> 00:13:46,321
Okay, so there's Descartes.

129
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,600
In 1638, one of the few dates I know.

130
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,080
That's Descartes' meditations.

131
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,161
That's the beginning of modernity.

132
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:54,560
Yeah.

133
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,920
I don't know if the values of that or modern.

134
00:14:00,241 --> 00:14:00,880
Yes.

135
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,881
I'm not sure what that is.

136
00:14:03,201 --> 00:14:06,241
The modern scientific way of looking at things?

137
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,320
Yes.

138
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:18,520
Utility makes me sort of nervous, but I see what you mean, because I do, they do say finally, the test is whether it brings you joy or not.

139
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,441
And that's a kind of satisfaction wouldn't feel right.

140
00:14:22,441 --> 00:14:26,040
And utility is sometimes mixed up with satisfaction.

141
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:33,881
But if you put it in what brings you the most fulfillment or bliss or joy, that's right.

142
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:36,760
They're exclaiming, ah, okay.

143
00:14:37,721 --> 00:14:50,600
So, and they're not doing anything like justifying why they think that this early Christian lifestyle brings you more joy.

144
00:14:51,721 --> 00:14:53,880
It's not time yet.

145
00:14:53,881 --> 00:15:15,400
I mean, only they sense that something's deeply wrong with modernity, that this idea that every individual is self-sufficient and autonomous and rational, and that and thanks to science and thanks to rationality, they're going to take over the world, they're going to improve everything.

146
00:15:15,401 --> 00:15:30,040
It's the whole picture of that we're finally got a grip on our own destiny, humanity has, and thanks to reason and science, we will now make a world in which everything works out and everybody's happy.

147
00:15:30,040 --> 00:16:01,600
That's well, that's a view that Dostoevsky already thinks is happening, and that he hasn't, they, nobody's really trying to make an argument that there's some deep thing wrong with modernity, that it's nihilistic, that you can't really be joyful if you follow it out, and that's why you have to return to the Christians.

148
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,800
They sense there's something wrong.

149
00:16:05,441 --> 00:16:08,481
And they sense that it's got to do with the Enlightenment.

150
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:31,600
And back to Plato, it really takes, I'm trying to think, maybe Heidegger, whom I mention every once in a while, is the first person who tries to really derive, give an account of human beings such that a life of theory and reflection is not going to be, to use your language, satisfactory life.

151
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,520
Exactly.

152
00:16:37,681 --> 00:17:03,441
That's how, being not a philosopher, but a writer, he's going to get you inside, if he makes it work, the experience of Ivan and make it seem, anyway, as if that's the result of thinking like an Enlightenment person and doing philosophy, and inside the world of Alyasha, who's happy and thriving, who doesn't think that way.

153
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:12,241
I happen to have marked in my copy of the Brothers what is exactly relevant to this conversation, so I'm going to read it.

154
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:23,680
It's Dostoevsky doing what he often does, make up a whole position which he is criticizing.

155
00:17:23,681 --> 00:17:29,920
And he puts it, in this case, in the mouth, a position, sort of an enlightenment position.

156
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:32,640
It's got to do with this idea of the new man.

157
00:17:32,641 --> 00:17:39,840
And the most absurd, extreme view of it is on page 751.

158
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,121
And it's, and who of all people is telling him his view?

159
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,400
It's the devil.

160
00:17:45,721 --> 00:18:04,441
And then he says at the bottom of 751, now this is Dostoevsky sort of extrapolating this Enlightenment view that people will become autonomous and mature and take over their own lives and take over the world.

161
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:19,160
He says, as soon as men have all denied God, and I believe that period corresponding with a geological period, will come to pass, the old conception of the universe will fall of itself.

162
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,840
And what's more, the old morality, and everything will begin anew.

163
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:30,360
Men will unite to take from life all it can give, but only for joy and happiness in the present.

164
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:37,320
Man will be lifted up with a titanic pride, extending his conquest of nature by his will and his science.

165
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:43,241
Man will feel such a lofty joy from hour to hour that it will make up for all his old dreams of the joys of heaven.

166
00:18:43,241 --> 00:18:48,520
Everyone will know that he is mortal and will accept death proudly and serenely.

167
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,840
And so forth and so forth.

168
00:18:51,161 --> 00:18:52,280
Let's see if I want to read.

169
00:18:52,681 --> 00:19:13,241
Well, it follows from this, of course, it comes out soon from the devil explaining Yvonne's views, that promoted to his new position, man may lightheartedly overstep all, his new position, meaning taking the place of God, overstep all the barriers of the old morality of the old slave man, if necessary.

170
00:19:13,241 --> 00:19:15,161
Nietzsche calls it the slave morality.

171
00:19:15,161 --> 00:19:21,801
I mean, Dostoevsky's constantly inventing all these other views, and this is a sort of a wild extreme of Nietzsche.

172
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,280
There is no law for God.

173
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,920
Where God stands, where I stand will become the foremost place.

174
00:19:29,921 --> 00:19:33,040
All things are lawful, and that's the end of it.

175
00:19:29,161 --> 00:19:33,921
And so forth.

176
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:53,441
Now, and another place where Dostoevsky is talking about this, it's very strange that I happen to have marked them both, where Yvonne gives his speech in favor of the Enlightenment people in 260.

177
00:19:53,441 --> 00:19:58,160
I didn't read it, but he says he wants to go to Europe.

178
00:19:58,161 --> 00:20:00,560
This is the top of 260, roughly.

179
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,241
And he says, every stone, and fall on the grave.

180
00:20:04,241 --> 00:20:09,201
It's a sort of parody of Alyasha falling on the ground.

181
00:20:09,201 --> 00:20:13,120
He's going to fall on the grave of the dead that lie there.

182
00:20:13,121 --> 00:20:21,361
Every stone over them speaks of such burning life in the past, passionate faith in their work, in their truth, their struggle, and their science.

183
00:20:21,681 --> 00:20:24,640
I know I shall fall on the ground and kiss those stones.

184
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:28,000
It's just the weirdest relation to Alyasha.

185
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,520
Kiss those stones and weep over them, even though I'm convinced in my heart that it's long been nothing but a graveyard.

186
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:39,520
And I shall not weep from despair because I shall be happy in those tears and so forth.

187
00:20:41,681 --> 00:20:42,560
That's enough.

188
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,601
I mean, so anyway, we're not disagreeing at all.

189
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:58,241
I mean, his way of arguing is to present what he, a kind of caricature and a kind of extrapolation of modernity to its extreme limits.

190
00:20:58,241 --> 00:21:02,320
And you'll see when you read the gay science, it sounds pretty much like Nietzsche.

191
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:06,800
And so, you got any more you want to say about it?

192
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,360
I think you're probably, that may well be.

193
00:21:17,961 --> 00:21:41,160
But what happens anyway in his defense, so to speak, is Nietzsche, who is very articulate and philosophical, not in the sense that he's detached, he's very passionate about it all, but he's trying to sort of draw out the logic of this position and make a case for it.

194
00:21:41,161 --> 00:21:42,281
So wait and see.

195
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,481
We're just getting there.

196
00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:48,600
I mean, in fact, that's the subject of the death of God thing we're going to do next time.

197
00:21:49,401 --> 00:21:55,560
Because this is already about the death of God and what we will become, how we brought it about.

198
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:03,961
Well, no, then Nietzsche's going to claim not only is God dead, but we, quote, we have killed him, and we will then have to become God ourselves.

199
00:22:03,961 --> 00:22:10,760
It sounds exactly like trying to work out the Dostoevsky vision.

200
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,560
Okay.

201
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:25,881
So, and now I'm just going to do the historical context for a bit, which is not something I normally would like to do, because I don't think it matters much to the literature, adds much to the literature and to the thought.

202
00:22:26,201 --> 00:22:41,320
But just so you know, all three of these thinkers, Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, and Nietzsche, are in roughly the same period when people begin to lose faith in the Enlightenment, the very most sensitive people.

203
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,721
So, Kierkegaard writes in 1850, and he's first.

204
00:22:45,721 --> 00:22:49,880
Then Dostoevsky and Nietzsche at exactly the same time.

205
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:52,840
Their big books are the same time.

206
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,080
They're a generation later.

207
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:03,360
Dostoevsky, in his old age, as old as he gets to be before he dies, writes The Brothers in 1881.

208
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:14,721
Nietzsche, who doesn't die young, but goes crazy and stops writing young, writes The Gay Science in 1882.

209
00:23:14,721 --> 00:23:18,241
One year apart, The Brothers and The Gay Science.

210
00:23:18,241 --> 00:23:24,241
Yet they seem a generation apart and come as if they come from other worlds, and they do.

211
00:23:24,241 --> 00:23:39,121
I mean, there's a huge difference between Dostoevsky saying, I'm going to save Christianity from modernity and science and rationality, and Nietzsche saying, who wants to say, why would we want to save Christianity?

212
00:23:39,121 --> 00:23:44,560
We've got something better coming than Christianity or the Enlightenment.

213
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,400
But there they are, within a year of each other, these two books.

214
00:23:48,401 --> 00:23:54,400
And there is some speculation whether Nietzsche could have read Dostoevsky.

215
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:55,360
He could have.

216
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:09,120
But he couldn't have read The Gay Science, because if he brought out, sorry, he couldn't have read The Brothers Karamatsov before bringing out The Gay Science, because you can't write and publish a book in a year.

217
00:24:09,121 --> 00:24:13,840
Those books come out in, as I say, in 1881 and 1882.

218
00:24:14,401 --> 00:24:24,160
Later, The Twilight, The Idols, and The Antichrist are written in 1888.

219
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:35,120
And at that point, Nietzsche could, in principle, have read a translation of The Brothers, but nobody has any evidence whether he read Dostoevsky or not.

220
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:36,160
Yeah.

221
00:24:36,481 --> 00:24:37,120
Where?

222
00:24:38,721 --> 00:24:39,600
Exactly.

223
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,760
That's why I put in page 110.

224
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,040
Let's look at it.

225
00:24:43,201 --> 00:24:45,401
He knows Dostoevsky exists.

226
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:56,280
He even knows, the footnote tells us, on page 200, right at the very end, that he says that he read notes from underground.

227
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:04,760
But what he says here on 110 is: and that's why people wonder how much Dostoevsky he read.

228
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:12,760
He says, Dostoevsky, the only psychologist, by the way, from whom I had anything to learn, is one of the happiest accidents of my life.

229
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,041
By the way, he's got this double meaning of psychologists.

230
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,320
I mentioned this already.

231
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:31,481
When Nietzsche says psychologist, he means somebody who has some deep understanding of the human psyche, but isn't sort of a professional psychologist who thinks they've got a science of the human psyche.

232
00:25:31,721 --> 00:25:43,320
And the professional psychologists, he can't stand, and he's making fun of them during the whole trial, the forensic psychologists who are sort of official authorities on how the mind works.

233
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:54,600
But when he says that Dostoevsky's a psychologist, he means he's a deep understanding of the human being's mind or self.

234
00:25:54,921 --> 00:26:05,160
So that's the, and he says, this profound underlying human being, ten times justified in despising the superficial Germans.

235
00:26:05,161 --> 00:26:07,080
Never mind that.

236
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:13,881
That's just a, it's a funny thing that both Dostoevsky and Nietzsche have this in common.

237
00:26:13,881 --> 00:26:16,120
They don't like the Germans.

238
00:26:16,121 --> 00:26:23,160
Nietzsche's Swiss, and German is his native language, but he thinks the Germans are sort of heavy-handed and boring.

239
00:26:23,161 --> 00:26:34,640
Dostoevsky mostly thinks the German, has German doctors, and the German doctors always say it's brain fever when somebody's having some deep religious experience.

240
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:37,360
But Dostoevsky to my always puzzlement.

241
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:45,441
I mean, I would have thought he would think all German doctors were hopeless and thought that anybody who was having any interesting experience had brain fever.

242
00:26:45,441 --> 00:26:49,121
But there is one nice German doctor, you remember, Dr.

243
00:26:49,121 --> 00:26:53,840
Herrzenstube, the one who gave Dmitri the nuts and baptized him.

244
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,721
I'm amazed.

245
00:26:54,721 --> 00:26:59,920
I think it's to Dostoevsky's credit that he's not sort of fanatically anti-German.

246
00:26:59,921 --> 00:27:04,800
I think Nietzsche's kind of got really, I don't think there's any good Germans in Nietzsche.

247
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,760
Yeah.

248
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,481
Okay, so now where are we?

249
00:27:10,481 --> 00:27:13,760
Well, I'm just bringing you up to date on what they know about each other.

250
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,160
So the question, now, what did Nietzsche know?

251
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:30,080
Well, he was told by his friend Georg Brandes the following: There's a Nordic author, Søren Kierkegaard, whose works would interest you if only they were translated.

252
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:36,640
He is, in my view, the deepest of psychologists on the whole there has ever been.

253
00:27:36,641 --> 00:27:46,481
And Nietzsche answers his friend, quote, For my next trick, I have resolved to occupy myself with the psychological problem of Kierkegaard.

254
00:27:46,481 --> 00:27:50,800
But he never, then he collapsed and he never did it.

255
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,040
But he did say about Dostoevsky what I just read on 110.

256
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:03,040
And as I say in my notes, Dostoevsky, of course, didn't know any Nietzsche, but he didn't need to.

257
00:28:03,121 --> 00:28:04,080
He made him up.

258
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:30,441
He not only makes him up in that sort of caricature of the devil, but in The Possessed, or The Devils, as that's the same book, there's a whole Nietzschean character, Kirilov, and in Crime and Punishment, which a lot of you have read, Raskolnikov has lots of Nietzschean views about being superior and doesn't and not having to obey the moral law anymore because he's a sort of super person.

259
00:28:30,441 --> 00:28:41,961
Nietzsche brings in this notion of the Übermensch, the person who has gotten beyond where people are normally subservient to some authority or other.

260
00:28:42,441 --> 00:28:44,041
So now let me see where we are.

261
00:28:44,600 --> 00:29:03,241
So we're going to talk about today for the rest of the time, probably, what Dostoevsky and Nietzsche have in common, or what Dostoevsky and Kierkegaard on the one hand, even though they're pro-Christian, and Nietzsche, who's terribly anti-Christian, they have a common view.

262
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:06,520
And who would be their common enemy?

263
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,640
You could figure it out.

264
00:29:07,641 --> 00:29:08,841
The Greeks, right?

265
00:29:09,641 --> 00:29:24,040
The Athenian Greeks, Socrates and Plato, Aristotle didn't show up, they both have the same view that that's a very in both of them think that's a sick way to life, or a sick kind of life, all three of them really.

266
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,201
So now let's see where we are.

267
00:29:26,441 --> 00:29:28,681
And okay, I'm going to talk about what they have in common.

268
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:39,241
Next time I'm going to talk about how they are opposed and what we want to know, whether there's any way of deciding who's right, sort of what he's asking.

269
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,241
What are the arguments?

270
00:29:41,241 --> 00:29:43,000
Which side should we be on?

271
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,600
We're going to think about that till the end of the course, and try to figure out.

272
00:29:49,600 --> 00:30:09,520
Well, I'm going to ask you in the last lecture finally where where you come down on this big debate about whether you want to save original Christianity or whether you want to get rid of it for some new higher form of being like Nietzsche, or whether you have some third alternative.

273
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,041
You could keep that in mind.

274
00:30:11,441 --> 00:30:14,000
That's the question he's really raising.

275
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,201
Okay, any questions there?

276
00:30:15,201 --> 00:30:20,400
Because now I'm going to go on to what both of them have to say about the Greeks.

277
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:26,721
It's a complicated and interesting story because the Greeks mean two different things.

278
00:30:26,721 --> 00:30:27,601
That's the first thing.

279
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:36,000
You won't be able to understand the reading if I don't tell you that Nietzsche loves the Greeks and he hates the Greeks.

280
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,361
And that's because there are two bunches of Greeks.

281
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,241
They're the Homeric Greeks, which you read about in the Iliad and the Odyssey.

282
00:30:44,241 --> 00:30:55,841
And that's something like 500 years before the Athenian Greeks that you read about when you read Socrates and Plato and Aristotle.

283
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,880
And Nietzsche thinks the Homeric Greeks are the best form of life ever, I believe.

284
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,680
I can't think of any people he thinks are better except his own people.

285
00:31:05,681 --> 00:31:10,961
But I mean, up to Nietzsche, the Homeric Greeks were the best you could get.

286
00:31:12,001 --> 00:31:18,321
And he thinks that the Greek philosophers were sick, the whole Athenian culture.

287
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,841
So you got that?

288
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,800
So, and you'll see, I'll tell you which is which as we go along, and then you'll get used to it.

289
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,560
You'll be able to figure it out.

290
00:31:26,561 --> 00:31:33,040
He takes for granted that you can tell whether he's talking about the good Greeks or the bad Greeks.

291
00:31:33,681 --> 00:31:45,241
So the Homeric Greeks were, according to him, noble, passionate, involved, impulsive, and they could trust their instinctive responses.

292
00:31:45,561 --> 00:32:04,681
That means without reflection, with, you might say, with the recklessness of the Karamatsov, to use Dostoevsky's phrase, they just spontaneously act, and they are, and that gives them a kind of perfection in living.

293
00:32:04,681 --> 00:32:09,081
They don't magically act this way, I presume.

294
00:32:09,081 --> 00:32:40,361
They learn, I mean, in the background, I think Nietzsche must think that when you grow up in a good culture, you take on this culture and you try it out and you improve it, so that the Homeric culture, when people grow up in it, they grow up with good instincts, that is, good intuitions, the good sense of what's the appropriate thing to do in any given situation.

295
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:49,721
Instinct, when I'm using it, the way Nietzsche uses it, isn't something that you have when you're born, like birds knowing how to build nests.

296
00:32:49,721 --> 00:33:00,280
Instinct, when Nietzsche uses it, means being able to, without reflection, just immediately, impulsively, do the appropriate thing.

297
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:06,440
And he thinks the Homeric Greeks culture gives all the young Homeric Greeks who grow up in it these good instincts.

298
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,201
So I'm going to read things now.

299
00:33:08,201 --> 00:33:14,681
Now you have your, you open your copy you brought with you of Twilight of the Idols to page 59.

300
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:23,721
Right before the number three, he says, everything good is instinct and consequently easy, necessary, free.

301
00:33:23,721 --> 00:33:26,280
Effort is an objection.

302
00:33:27,081 --> 00:33:29,521
That's this picture you've got.

303
00:33:29,001 --> 00:33:33,440
It may be sort of something that the Zen Buddhists have, too.

304
00:33:33,601 --> 00:33:52,401
I mean, you get some, and in a certain way, it's what every expert or master in whatever domain, a master musician or a master basketball player or whatever, has this ability to just spontaneously do it.

305
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:57,121
I mean, they talk about being in the groove or playing out of their heads and so forth.

306
00:33:57,121 --> 00:34:01,361
I mean, I think Nietzsche pictures all these Greek heroes who are doing that.

307
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:08,641
They are just so good at being human and doing what they do that they can just do it spontaneously.

308
00:34:08,641 --> 00:34:13,521
If you have to work at it just figure it out, you certainly aren't going to do it very well.

309
00:34:13,521 --> 00:34:15,441
There's a certain thing that amuses me.

310
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:18,960
She got her hand up and then you, I'll just, then I'll call on you.

311
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:30,241
I mean, one of my colleagues, Bernard Williams, told me, I don't know where it is, that when Nietzsche, I know that Nietzsche objects to anything where he says effort is an objection.

312
00:34:30,241 --> 00:34:32,560
He didn't like the music of Beethoven.

313
00:34:32,561 --> 00:34:37,841
And his way of describing that he didn't like it was, Beethoven's music sweats.

314
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,961
That means, I mean, whereas with Mozart, you feel that it's just effortless and graceful.

315
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:53,681
You feel it, and I think it's true, Beethoven wrote it, wrote, you could see the manuscripts, wrote something over and over and sort of beat his head on the wall and stamped his feet on the floor trying to get it right.

316
00:34:53,681 --> 00:34:59,681
And Nietzsche thinks that's a sign that this is probably not as great as it should be.

317
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:01,201
Now, you want to say something?

318
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,081
Maybe Intelligent.

319
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:08,241
It is more after the abstractions.

320
00:35:08,561 --> 00:35:09,601
Who Nietzsche is at?

321
00:35:09,681 --> 00:35:10,320
Nietzsche?

322
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,480
Buddhism.

323
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,121
As in.

324
00:35:13,121 --> 00:35:13,721
Okay, yes, sir.

325
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:17,081
Because you have things in the desert.

326
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:26,441
It has an interaction that keeps you in the present moment, like stingrick and sometimes there's kind of that curiosity.

327
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,320
Because you have to focus on doing that staff.

328
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:47,560
Okay, but then it's very different because Nietzsche also thinks in certain sense that you should be acting in the present moment, but he doesn't think that it's something that you could get by in a way of sort of putting your mind out of it.

329
00:35:47,561 --> 00:35:52,361
It somehow, the difference would be something like, and this may be all wrong, I'm just guessing.

330
00:35:52,360 --> 00:36:06,280
I mean, you could sort of get in the present moment by a kind of abstraction from your normal involvement, or you could get into the present moment by being totally involved in what you're doing.

331
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,880
And that might be a big difference.

332
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:14,201
I mean, when you're playing basketball, you can't play basketball in a Zen Buddhist-like frame of mind.

333
00:36:14,201 --> 00:36:17,081
You've got to be totally in the flow.

334
00:36:17,081 --> 00:36:19,320
And that's it's a different flow.

335
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,721
I think they both want to be totally in the flow.

336
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,721
They are both totally in the moment.

337
00:36:23,721 --> 00:36:33,081
But my intuition is that it makes a big difference whether you've achieved this by a kind of detachment or whether you've achieved this by total involvement.

338
00:36:33,081 --> 00:36:34,760
Does that make any sense?

339
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,161
That way of doing things is that there's no point worrying about the transcription as well.

340
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,640
And we both want to worry about the past from starting zone.

341
00:36:43,641 --> 00:36:52,920
But for Nietzsche, it's not there's a lack of pair anything it's being hockey care I think that's exactly right.

342
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,481
Yeah, that's a very important difference.

343
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:44,561
Uh yeah, wait, before you, there was so many, yeah well it's well if I understand you right, you're making the same kind of argument that Rikitin was making to Dimitri, that somehow the fact the fact that there is a a physics underlying being in the zone and and being totally involved and thereby acting instinctively, surely the your dopamine is being secreted and we know lots about what parts of the brain are being involved when you're playing say grandmaster chess at one second to move.

344
00:37:44,561 --> 00:37:58,640
And that but that doesn't but the science is one story and and the sort of what it is that the chess grandmaster or the basketball player is doing is a different level of description and they don't contradict each other.

345
00:37:58,641 --> 00:38:07,041
When you know how the brain does it, you still have to understand that what they're doing is playing chess or playing music or playing a a game.

346
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:10,800
You can't translate all that into neurons.

347
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:15,280
But it's it's it's what?

348
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:18,000
It's not a it's not a problem.

349
00:38:18,001 --> 00:38:33,040
I mean science and even Dostoevsky I think thinks science explains causally everything that can be explained causally, but on the level of meaning, say of rules of winning and losing and so forth, then science isn't in that business.

350
00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:34,800
It doesn't fail to explain it.

351
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,320
It just it's just not the sort of thing that's going to be explained causally.

352
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,360
Does that help any?

353
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:44,280
I mean so so so there's it it it shouldn't come to some kind of conflict.

354
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,360
I mean, see if I can make it fairly dramatic.

355
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:52,841
I mean, science explains the fact that we're conscious and see each other, or is getting better and better at it.

356
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:59,401
But no matter what they find out about it, there's something else going on, namely we're conscious and see each other.

357
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:05,961
And that's not one people say sometimes, that's first-person experience.

358
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:13,000
And science can give you a third-person description of the causal basis of first-person experience, but that doesn't replace.

359
00:39:13,241 --> 00:39:14,600
That's the best I can do on that.

360
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:17,960
It's the same thing I said about Rakitin and Dmitri.

361
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,561
Did you have your hand up too?

362
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,041
Yeah, but do we need to talk about that?

363
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,640
We certainly must not.

364
00:39:25,641 --> 00:39:26,840
He turned against Spinoza.

365
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,681
He was very influenced by Spinoza.

366
00:39:28,681 --> 00:39:33,081
But by the time we get to the gay science, he is, I'm sorry, Schopenhauer.

367
00:39:33,241 --> 00:39:35,881
He turned against Schopenhauer completely.

368
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:49,401
And the whole idea that we should get out of the willing, involved world, which Schopenhauer had, and Nietzsche turned it upside down and doesn't believe it anymore.

369
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:55,001
But it's important that Schopenhauer was a big influence on him at the beginning.

370
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:55,400
Yeah.

371
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,640
The critique of it, yes.

372
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:11,721
To reflect and deliberate and act, sort of, yes.

373
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,201
I must tell you, David, it was very important.

374
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:22,640
It takes a lot of practice.

375
00:40:22,641 --> 00:40:23,681
He doesn't deny it.

376
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:24,001
He doesn't.

377
00:40:25,161 --> 00:40:27,721
No, it it is when you finally got.

378
00:40:27,721 --> 00:40:28,760
We're not disagreeing.

379
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,960
It takes a lot of effort to become able to do it effortlessly.

380
00:40:33,201 --> 00:40:36,960
That is, that that's that and Nietzsche didn't likes that.

381
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:55,360
But in the end, it's the effortless performance of the master which Nietzsche admires and thinks this whole emphasis on rationality, decision-making, you should reflect on what you do before you do it and weigh the pros and cons.

382
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,881
I forget if I said it here or did some other conversation.

383
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,161
The example of the guy in New York who jumped on the subway.

384
00:41:02,161 --> 00:41:02,960
Yeah, I did already.

385
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,840
I thought I did.

386
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:11,841
I mean, there was no time to reflect and deliberate and weigh the various possibilities, but Nietzsche would have admired that guy immensely.

387
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,760
He had the right instinct.

388
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,841
He knew somebody had to save this guy, and he did it.

389
00:41:18,161 --> 00:41:24,000
Okay, so that's, and that's, so everything, it's, we're all on the same page.

390
00:41:24,001 --> 00:41:25,280
That's good.

391
00:41:26,241 --> 00:41:46,961
So for human, what Nietzsche means by instinct isn't automatic animal instinct, but it's what you embody the skills and practices of your culture, and you have to have lots of experience, and then you can act effortlessly and spontaneously and do the appropriate thing.

392
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:53,840
You are what a contemporary writer about these things calls a cultural virtuoso.

393
00:41:53,840 --> 00:42:05,201
A cultural virtuoso does, and I say it in Aristotelian jargon, does straight, straightway does the appropriate thing at the appropriate time in the appropriate way.

394
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:31,401
That's the, it's interesting that Aristotle should say this, because that's Aristotle's sort of the nearest thing to getting things right than being very anti-Plato and anti-Socrates, because Aristotle understands that what he calls practical wisdom, which I just was talking about, almost understands that practical wisdom is spontaneously acting.

395
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,520
But only almost, because it's so interesting in Aristotle.

396
00:42:34,521 --> 00:42:41,560
He's got one foot in what Nietzsche thinks, and one foot totally corrupted by Socrates and Plato.

397
00:42:41,561 --> 00:42:58,760
What he says is that the man of practical wisdom immediately sees the appropriate thing to do at the appropriate time in the appropriate way, and then he has to think it over to decide whether it lives up to sort of rational critical reflection.

398
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,161
Otherwise, he would just be doing crazy things.

399
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:04,280
But as soon as you say that, what?

400
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,481
You lose it.

401
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,520
Because there is a famous story.

402
00:43:08,521 --> 00:43:13,081
I don't think I told you this one about Knobloch as the second baseman.

403
00:43:13,081 --> 00:43:13,800
Did I?

404
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,680
I don't think so.

405
00:43:14,681 --> 00:43:20,600
Just to give you an example, what happens when you reflect, there was this famous second baseman for the Yankees.

406
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:21,081
Is that right?

407
00:43:21,081 --> 00:43:22,280
Does any of you know?

408
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:22,841
Yeah.

409
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:28,121
Who won some award for being such a good baseball player?

410
00:43:28,121 --> 00:43:31,481
And one day he thought about what he was doing.

411
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:35,961
And when he thought about it, he couldn't throw the ball to first base anymore.

412
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,640
He threw it into the stands.

413
00:43:37,641 --> 00:43:40,760
He threw it into the face of some baseball announcer.

414
00:43:42,601 --> 00:43:44,280
But I learned a new thing.

415
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:50,841
He could sometimes feel the ball all right, but only if it was coming very fast and he didn't have time to think.

416
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,481
But if he had time to think, he couldn't do it.

417
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:58,520
And so he put him in the outfield, but he couldn't stop thinking and he couldn't throw the ball in from the outfield.

418
00:43:58,521 --> 00:44:00,641
And finally, he had to give up baseball.

419
00:44:00,641 --> 00:44:02,640
And this is really, Nietzsche would love it.

420
00:43:59,161 --> 00:44:04,161
Nietzsche would say, yeah, that's it.

421
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:09,440
That's what happens if you think that you have to reflect when you act.

422
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,161
Okay, so I'm a big fan of not reflecting.

423
00:44:14,161 --> 00:44:18,641
And so I collect these stories when I see them.

424
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,641
Oh, there's one more, but I don't know all the details, so I can say it fast.

425
00:44:22,641 --> 00:44:25,760
About a very important soccer game.

426
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,400
Soccer, is that when you kick the ball into the net?

427
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:28,800
Yeah.

428
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,200
Yeah.

429
00:44:29,521 --> 00:44:44,321
Okay, a very important soccer game where the very good goalie missed a very easy, in the crucial moment, missed, failed to stop a ball that would have been very easy to stop.

430
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,521
And the team lost the game and lost the series and everything.

431
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:53,121
And when asked how he could do that, he said, it was so easy I had time to think.

432
00:44:53,121 --> 00:44:55,441
And that, again, it's the same phenomenon.

433
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,361
And okay, now back to Nietzsche, who understands that phenomenon.

434
00:45:00,001 --> 00:45:04,721
It's as if, in a certain way, instinct is higher immediacy.

435
00:45:04,721 --> 00:45:13,361
That is, in Kierkegaard language, you have to start just doing things impulsively, and you wouldn't do them brilliantly.

436
00:45:13,681 --> 00:45:25,601
And then you have to go through a lot of work and reflect and think of following rules and learn your skill and feel good about your successes and feel bad about your failures and take risks.

437
00:45:25,601 --> 00:45:42,401
And after all of that mediation, you finally get the expertise, the mastery part, and then you've got a kind of higher immediacy because you respond completely, immediately, and fully to the particular situation.

438
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,881
Only after all that work, you do it right.

439
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:56,680
Now, Kierkegaard can put it that way: Nietzsche, you'll notice, never talks about, and somebody I think was onto that, but I didn't listen to them right.

440
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:01,641
Nietzsche never talks about what you have to do to get this kind of instinct.

441
00:46:01,641 --> 00:46:14,521
That in any, I think almost all of these skills, not always, but most of them, you have to go through a kind of reflection and critical stage to go to get them.

442
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:20,601
Because Nietzsche thinks somehow that you just pick them up right off, I don't know how.

443
00:46:20,601 --> 00:46:22,681
Well, it does happen.

444
00:46:22,681 --> 00:46:24,040
Sometimes you pick them up.

445
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:25,561
I mean, let me give you an example.

446
00:46:25,561 --> 00:46:29,881
I mean, people, have I ever talked about distance standing between people?

447
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:40,121
People in any culture stand a certain distance from important people, from people of the opposite sex, from older people, from younger people, from the people they're intimate with.

448
00:46:40,121 --> 00:46:42,041
And there's some rules for how to do it.

449
00:46:42,041 --> 00:46:44,681
And if you stand too close, it makes people uneasy.

450
00:46:44,681 --> 00:46:47,080
And if you stand too far away, it makes people uneasy.

451
00:46:47,081 --> 00:46:48,360
I haven't talked about that.

452
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,161
No.

453
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,880
Because John Searle, my colleague, had this funny story.

454
00:46:51,880 --> 00:47:09,321
He says at international meetings, you can see the people from North Africa backing the people from Scandinavia into a corner because the people from North Africa are trying to get close enough to have a friendly conversation, and the Norwegians and Swedes are trying to get far enough away to have a friendly conversation.

455
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:13,081
They've got very different distance standing practices.

456
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:20,921
And what's interesting is you've developed this whole skill without ever having to go through any kind of mediation.

457
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,161
You don't know the rules for doing it.

458
00:47:23,161 --> 00:47:26,921
Your parents taught it to you, but they didn't even know they knew it or had it.

459
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:38,961
It's very complicated because, as I say, all the difference of the situation and the relation you have to the other person will determine how close you stand to them.

460
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,200
And it'll be different if they have a cold, you can stand further away.

461
00:47:43,201 --> 00:47:47,201
If there's an air hammer making noise in the background, you can stand nearer.

462
00:47:47,681 --> 00:47:50,561
You have a very subtle skill.

463
00:47:50,561 --> 00:47:54,800
And you pick it up without ever understanding it.

464
00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:02,641
And of course, if you tried to do it by rules, then you wouldn't be able to do it from the novel kind of problem.

465
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:19,040
So anyway, so it isn't, it is, and Nietzsche would be just interested mostly in the way the Homeric Greeks just picked up their instincts from their parents and from the culture, the way we pick up distance standing practices.

466
00:48:19,041 --> 00:48:22,641
He doesn't really believe you have to go through mediation.

467
00:48:22,641 --> 00:48:25,921
And the answer really is sometimes you do and sometimes you don't.

468
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,840
No, anything you see?

469
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,201
Yeah, Beatrice.

470
00:48:29,201 --> 00:48:29,520
Ah.

471
00:48:30,001 --> 00:48:34,480
I think though, it's not something that is a classic consultant.

472
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,440
It stands about the mediated roles.

473
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,880
And so that if you are if all of this is picking up just what you hope was practical.

474
00:48:43,201 --> 00:48:46,480
Well, you know, you ah, good, good, good.

475
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:56,641
Never mind Abraham, because we don't know enough about him and what and what it means for him to have heard this calling and do something that nobody did before.

476
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,520
If we just we just don't know.

477
00:48:59,521 --> 00:49:02,640
But to stick to the the problem about the herd instinct.

478
00:49:02,641 --> 00:49:14,601
Yeah, Nietzsche thinks, and you'll read you'll see when you're reading him, that the vast mass of people just do the normal, boring, standard thing.

479
00:49:11,521 --> 00:49:19,000
And of course, and distance standing is in a way the normal, boring, standard thing.

480
00:49:21,561 --> 00:49:24,280
So you're posing an interesting question.

481
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:35,641
My first answer, but I don't think it'll hold up, but it points in the right direction, is that in a boring standard culture, you pick up doing the boring standard thing.

482
00:49:35,641 --> 00:49:44,361
And in a culture like the Homeric Greeks, where everybody is much more attuned to the specific situations, you don't.

483
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,640
But I don't know what to say.

484
00:49:45,641 --> 00:49:57,241
That doesn't help much, because there is a whole lot of instinctual stuff you pick up from your culture, which Nietzsche doesn't like.

485
00:49:57,241 --> 00:50:01,001
And that's because he doesn't like conformists.

486
00:50:02,201 --> 00:50:03,320
It's funny.

487
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:06,280
Distance standing isn't a kind of conformism.

488
00:50:07,161 --> 00:50:08,520
I've never thought about this.

489
00:50:08,521 --> 00:50:14,041
I mean, it's to be a conformist, you've got to do it because that's what one does.

490
00:50:14,041 --> 00:50:17,960
And you know what it is that one does, and you do it because one does it.

491
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,360
Where one does it means the norm, it's the standard thing to do.

492
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:29,881
My favorite example, have I ever said this, is sending Christmas cards to people across the street who you see every day anyway.

493
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,681
Why in the world does anybody do such a crazy thing?

494
00:50:32,681 --> 00:50:34,280
Well, that's just what one does.

495
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:41,161
Nietzsche would just tear his hair and think that was absolutely amazingly stupid to do it because it's the thing one does.

496
00:50:42,201 --> 00:50:44,521
And that's what he's objecting to.

497
00:50:44,521 --> 00:50:49,561
And distance standing practices, you don't do it because one does it.

498
00:50:49,561 --> 00:50:52,280
You don't even know you've got distance standing practices.

499
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:55,881
And you can't say that somebody who stands the right distance is a conformist.

500
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,040
Nietzsche's really against conformists.

501
00:50:58,041 --> 00:50:59,121
By the way, I can't resist.

502
00:50:59,201 --> 00:51:00,641
How many know about Second Life?

503
00:50:59,001 --> 00:51:03,201
I'm writing and thinking about Second Life.

504
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:13,120
In the virtual world, it turns out, people put their avatars the appropriate distance from the other avatars, even though they don't know they're doing it.

505
00:51:13,121 --> 00:51:15,280
The people at Stanford have studied that.

506
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:22,081
It's something so pervasive and so ungraspable that it's fascinating.

507
00:51:22,081 --> 00:51:39,280
But anyway, so now you have to make a distinction between the kind of things that are standard and recognized as standard that people do because that's the right way to behave, which Nietzsche is against and thinks it's just all boring conformism.

508
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:50,001
And the kind of things people do because they are somehow, and now I don't know what to say, attuned to the particular situation.

509
00:51:50,001 --> 00:51:52,800
And they can get that from their culture too.

510
00:51:52,800 --> 00:52:03,120
And I think you've got to say with Nietzsche, there are herd cultures, that is cultures where everybody's sort of trying to imitate everybody else.

511
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:04,481
I'll give you an example.

512
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:10,000
And then there are cultures where people try to stand out from everybody else.

513
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:13,361
Let's say be heroes like in Homer.

514
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:33,361
I don't know whether this is fair, and I don't want to insult any Japanese people if it's not fair, but I've read this fascinating thing that for the Japanese, we have a slogan, the squeaky wheel gets the oil, meaning, you know, make sort of make a noise, stand out.

515
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:39,521
And I gather the equivalent Japanese expression is the nail that sticks out and gets pounded down.

516
00:52:39,521 --> 00:52:54,681
And you can see a culture sort of making a kind of virtue of conformism as a way of community and what am I trying to think?

517
00:52:54,681 --> 00:52:59,241
Unanimity, as I think happens in Japan, probably.

518
00:52:59,241 --> 00:53:05,561
Or you can see a culture that makes, and you can do it well or stupidly, and we can do it well or stupidly.

519
00:53:05,561 --> 00:53:11,721
We make a culture in which everybody wants to sort of be an individual and get what they want.

520
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:16,121
That can, Nietzsche would prefer that, for sure.

521
00:53:16,121 --> 00:53:21,241
Okay, I didn't mean to get into this so far, but it's a whole world in there.

522
00:53:21,241 --> 00:53:23,241
So let's get back to where we were.

523
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,321
I'm just catching up now.

524
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:38,601
So sum up, noble instinct in Nietzsche is the source of action, and it's impulsive, spontaneous, unreflective, adaptable, and successful, and makes you happy when you're doing it.

525
00:53:39,161 --> 00:53:57,001
And that kind of higher immediacy is destroyed when you get a culture that thinks that reflection and rationality and decision-making and all that is the highest form of human life.

526
00:53:57,001 --> 00:54:01,721
Okay, so now that gets us to the bad guys, the Socratic Greeks.

527
00:54:01,721 --> 00:54:03,320
How many read any Socrates?

528
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,360
Some good.

529
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,641
Any Plato?

530
00:54:05,641 --> 00:54:06,841
That's interesting.

531
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:09,000
Well, of course you can't read Socrates.

532
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,760
That's a crazy question.

533
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:15,001
So Plato is recording of Socrates, so you're always reading Plato.

534
00:54:15,561 --> 00:54:20,680
But sometimes Plato is giving you his own story, and always telling you it's Socrates.

535
00:54:20,681 --> 00:54:25,800
But sometimes he's really describing what Socrates is doing, and sometimes he's putting his own ideas.

536
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,840
So it doesn't matter.

537
00:54:27,081 --> 00:54:30,080
For what we're talking about, either one.

538
00:54:28,681 --> 00:54:32,720
So I'm just going to call them the Socratic Greeks.

539
00:54:33,601 --> 00:54:44,881
And those are the ones who lost their instincts, don't trust their responses, and have to constantly sort of figure out what to do.

540
00:54:44,880 --> 00:55:02,800
So that now we get Nietzsche's amazingly weird take on Socrates, who, if you read anything about Socrates or Socrates, is presented as such a hero of our culture, the hero of the Enlightenment Greek way of looking at things.

541
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,721
I mean, the Greek way of looking at things that gets taken up by the Enlightenment.

542
00:55:06,721 --> 00:55:09,760
That is, being rational.

543
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:17,041
And of course, what Nietzsche is going to say is that that just shows that the Greeks and Socrates were sick.

544
00:55:17,041 --> 00:55:26,880
And so starting on 43 of Twilight, page 43, where are we on page?

545
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,401
So I think I'll begin at the bottom of 42.

546
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:34,000
Socrates saw even more of a three-now.

547
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:46,800
He saw behind his aristocratic Athenians, he grasped that his case, the idiosyncrasy of his case, was already no longer exceptional.

548
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:52,481
Now comes what's happening to him and all of the Athenians.

549
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:58,881
I mean, in effect, what Nietzsche's going to say is they're all sick because they can't trust their instincts anymore.

550
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,081
So he says this is now the very bottom of 42.

551
00:56:02,081 --> 00:56:05,920
The same kind of degeneration was everywhere silently preparing itself.

552
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,441
The old Athenians, the old Athens was coming to an end.

553
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:16,760
And Socrates understood that all the world had need for him, his expedients, his cure, his personal art of self-preservation.

554
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,161
Everywhere the instincts were in anarchy.

555
00:56:19,161 --> 00:56:23,161
Everywhere people were but five steps from excess.

556
00:56:23,161 --> 00:56:29,481
The monsterium in animo, a monster in the soul, was the universal danger.

557
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:32,201
And I'm just going to read all of this because it's his whole story.

558
00:56:32,201 --> 00:56:33,800
The instincts want to play the tyrant.

559
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,280
We must devise a counter-tyrant who is stronger.

560
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,961
That's what Socrates thinks.

561
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:47,720
When the physiognomist revealed it somewhere, skipping, how did Socrates become master of himself and so forth?

562
00:56:49,641 --> 00:56:51,000
Where do I learn?

563
00:56:51,001 --> 00:56:53,800
So, well, skipping to the number 10 now.

564
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,040
And how did he become master of himself?

565
00:56:56,041 --> 00:57:00,201
Well, he made a tyrant of reason, as Socrates did.

566
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:07,561
And then rationality, here comes rationality as the answer to this kind of sickness.

567
00:57:07,561 --> 00:57:11,000
Rationality was at that time divined as a savior.

568
00:57:11,001 --> 00:57:14,920
Neither Socrates nor his invalids were free to be rational or not as they wished.

569
00:57:15,081 --> 00:57:16,360
It was de guer.

570
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,481
It was required.

571
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,401
It was their last expedient.

572
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:28,760
The fanaticism with which the whole of Greek thought throws itself at rationality, that would be Socrates and Plato's job, portrays a state of emergency.

573
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:29,880
One was in peril.

574
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:34,361
One had only one choice, either to perish or be absurdly rational.

575
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:38,201
Then he talks about Plato as a pathological condition.

576
00:57:38,201 --> 00:57:46,361
And Plato doesn't understand the unconscious and the spontaneous.

577
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:52,520
So at the last sentence, one must be prudent, this is Socrates, clear, right at any cost.

578
00:57:52,521 --> 00:57:58,960
Every yielding to the instincts, to the unconscious, that doesn't mean Freudian unconscious, leads downward.

579
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,161
That's what Plato thinks.

580
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:02,961
And Socrates, that's not what Nietzsche thinks.

581
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:04,161
Now, just a quick word.

582
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,880
I mean, why in the world is he saying this?

583
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:23,760
Well, all of us in high school or in philosophy 25A or something reads this wonderful story of how great Socrates was, criticizing everything and reflecting on everything and trying to make all of the Athenians critical and rational and so forth.

584
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,641
Why should we believe Nietzsche?

585
00:58:26,641 --> 00:58:29,760
Well, it's because, I mean, two ways to put it.

586
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,681
One is, you've got to realize that Nietzsche has a right to say this.

587
00:58:33,681 --> 00:58:42,880
He knows the whole Greek corpus of all that was written at the time of Athens and of Homeric Greek.

588
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:48,401
And he is a superstar of Greek philology, of Greek language and culture.

589
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,320
He got tenure at the age of 24 at the University of Basel.

590
00:58:53,041 --> 00:58:56,000
So he has a right to say it, and he gets it.

591
00:58:56,001 --> 00:59:01,200
Now I'm just saying this so you'll know that you could see that he might be right.

592
00:59:01,201 --> 00:59:17,841
He gets it from Thucydides in the Peloponnesian Wars, where Thucydides claims that because they had a plague and because they attacked the wrong people and lost a lot of war when they shouldn't have been attacking these other countries, they wanted to become an empire.

593
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:30,080
And so the Athenians did get so, that instead of having a successful direct democracy where they just got together every day and voted on what they should be doing, they began to disagree.

594
00:59:30,081 --> 00:59:32,561
They began to not trust each other.

595
00:59:32,561 --> 00:59:39,521
They would send out the generals one day and attack some country, and then they would call them back the next day and decide not to attack the country.

596
00:59:39,521 --> 00:59:41,440
So there's something to be said for this.

597
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:46,681
It's a very interesting minority report, not completely made up.

598
00:59:47,561 --> 00:59:49,161
So now let me see.

599
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:51,480
43, I think I just read it.

600
00:59:51,641 --> 00:59:51,960
Yeah.

601
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:57,001
42, yeah, and 43 again.

602
00:59:57,641 --> 00:59:58,200
Yeah.

603
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:03,161
So Socrates was a pseudo-Greek, he says, back on 39.

604
01:00:03,161 --> 01:00:10,520
I'm going back there just to tell you that when you see that, what does it mean that Socrates was a pseudo-Greek?

605
01:00:10,521 --> 01:00:12,361
I've given you the clue now.

606
01:00:12,601 --> 01:00:15,161
That Socrates was a bad Greek.

607
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,480
Well, it means he wasn't a Homeric Greek.

608
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:23,081
The real Greeks are the Homeric Greeks, and Socrates is far from that.

609
01:00:23,081 --> 01:00:37,800
He's at the bottom of the 39, he says, I recognize Socrates and Plato as symptoms of decay, as agents of the dissolution of Greece, as pseudo-Greek, anti-Greek, and so forth.

610
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:42,121
Well, when he's saying all that, he's always thinking, think of the Homeric heroes.

611
01:00:42,121 --> 01:00:43,800
Those were the real ones.

612
01:00:44,201 --> 01:00:53,001
On 41, for instance, at the end of section, the first paragraph on page 41.

613
01:00:53,001 --> 01:01:00,280
I seek to understand out of what idiosyncrasy the Socratic equation, reason equal virtue, equal happiness, derives.

614
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:06,841
That bizarrest of equations, one which has particularly all the instincts of the older Hellens against it.

615
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:12,041
The older Hellens, I have to give you the code, that's another name for the Homeric Greeks.

616
01:01:12,041 --> 01:01:14,040
I don't know why they're called Hellens.

617
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:15,880
I have no, I'm sure somebody knows.

618
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:16,201
You know?

619
01:01:16,681 --> 01:01:32,880
25 is the Roman candidate, with no meaning that Greeks are unnecessary, but actually the Hellens are what he calls themselves sort of a part of the thing about your origin because you showed the or itself, that boy's cut off the train.

620
01:01:34,241 --> 01:01:35,040
Don't tell us that.

621
01:01:35,041 --> 01:01:36,641
I don't think it's going to help.

622
01:01:36,641 --> 01:01:38,081
Ah, okay.

623
01:01:38,081 --> 01:01:38,400
Okay.

624
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,081
The old Greeks.

625
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:41,201
Okay.

626
01:01:41,521 --> 01:01:46,400
So, and so the older Helens here, that's the Homeric Greeks.

627
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,161
Those are the good Greeks.

628
01:01:48,161 --> 01:01:55,920
Now, and then came the bad Greeks, the ones who used rationality to control what they did.

629
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,041
We read that.

630
01:01:57,041 --> 01:02:03,201
And that shows that they were decadent on page 444.

631
01:02:03,201 --> 01:02:06,481
And all that follows from them is wrong.

632
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,721
Socrates, I'm in the middle of that top paragraph.

633
01:02:08,721 --> 01:02:11,200
Socrates was a misunderstanding.

634
01:02:11,201 --> 01:02:16,561
The entire morality of improvement, the Christian included, has been a misunderstanding.

635
01:02:16,561 --> 01:02:32,961
So that's where you can see, unlike the Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky, who want to pin it all, who want to separate Christian morality and Christian life from Greek, he's going to bring it all, he wants to put it all together.

636
01:02:33,201 --> 01:02:34,641
Now let's see.

637
01:02:35,121 --> 01:02:37,200
Just the end of that, 11.

638
01:02:37,201 --> 01:02:39,760
To have to combat one's instinct.

639
01:02:40,081 --> 01:02:42,080
That is the formula for decadence.

640
01:02:42,081 --> 01:02:46,160
As long as life is ascending, happiness and instinct are one.

641
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:53,041
Now, it's time to just remind you of how much this is like Dostoevsky.

642
01:02:54,880 --> 01:03:10,800
What happens with Ivan, remember, is that he's about to admit his guilt, he's about to turn himself in, and he stops to deliberate instead of doing what he was doing impulsively and with the recklessness of the Karamatsaus.

643
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:28,121
It's interesting that Dostoevsky and Nietzsche both agree on this one: that spontaneous responses are what is the highest form of action.

644
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:32,041
Let me see if I want to not confuse you.

645
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:44,201
So that's the sense in which both Dostoevsky are anti-Greek, that they both believe in this kind of spontaneous.

646
01:03:44,601 --> 01:03:53,800
So, because of the two kinds of Greek, they are both anti-Athenian Greek, and they both believe in the spontaneousness.

647
01:03:54,041 --> 01:04:00,520
Dostoevsky doesn't even know or care about the Homeric Greeks, but they both believe in spontaneous responses.

648
01:04:00,521 --> 01:04:15,321
I'm just going to read you something where on page 260 in the brothers that I never read, where Ivan is talking about loving the sticky green leaves and so forth.

649
01:04:17,001 --> 01:04:22,520
And Alyosha says, I understand, Ivan.

650
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:27,241
I think everyone should love life above everything in the world.

651
01:04:27,241 --> 01:04:31,081
And then Ivan says, Love life more than the meaning of it?

652
01:04:31,081 --> 01:04:33,960
Certainly, love it regardless of logic, as you say.

653
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,721
It must be regardless of logic.

654
01:04:35,721 --> 01:04:38,280
It's only then that you can understand the meaning of it.

655
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:49,800
So, in other words, it's only when you're just acting impulsively that you're in touch with what Dostoevsky's way of life.

656
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:53,960
Okay, now, let's see.

657
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:57,881
Yes, I want to see you.

658
01:04:57,961 --> 01:05:00,320
I've got only a few moments, but I want to finish this.

659
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:14,400
The main thing I haven't talked about is that because he's weak and death and decadent, the philosopher tries to step out of his life and become detached from it and judge it.

660
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,640
Now, that's the next thing that Nietzsche is against.

661
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:27,360
And you can't step out of life and judge it, he says, and because we're always totally involved in it.

662
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,881
Now, what does it sound like?

663
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:34,161
Dostoevsky is for, is with or against Nietzsche there?

664
01:05:34,161 --> 01:05:35,680
It's just like Dostoevsky.

665
01:05:36,161 --> 01:05:44,161
It's like the criticism of Yvonne that he tries to stand outside and decide whether life is worth living or not.

666
01:05:44,161 --> 01:05:47,440
And Nietzsche is very clear that you shouldn't be doing that.

667
01:05:48,001 --> 01:05:54,560
And what's interesting is, to me, is he calls it rebellion on the middle of page 55.

668
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:58,480
Rebellion is the name of the chapter in which Yvonne is.

669
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:06,001
I mean, it would make one think that Nietzsche had read Dostoevsky, except we know he couldn't have read the brothers.

670
01:06:06,001 --> 01:06:08,720
But I'll just read this quickly and then time is up.

671
01:06:09,041 --> 01:06:26,640
He says at the middle of 55, if one has grasped the blasphemousness of such a rebellion against life as has in Christian morality become virtually sacrosanct, one has fortunately grasped something else as well, the useless, illusoriness, absurdity of such a rebellion.

672
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,320
Now, why is it absurd?

673
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:33,760
For a condemnation of life by the living is, after all, no more a symptom of a certain kind of life.

674
01:06:33,761 --> 01:06:38,560
The question whether a condemnation is just or unjust has not been raised.

675
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:42,800
One would have to be situated outside of life, and so forth.

676
01:06:42,801 --> 01:06:49,800
So, when, and I'm skipping a little, when we speak of values, we do so under the inspiration and from a perspective of life.

677
01:06:44,081 --> 01:06:51,560
Life evaluates through us.

678
01:06:51,881 --> 01:06:57,320
From this, it follows that even the anti-nature of morality.

679
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:58,921
Well, no, I don't want to read that.

680
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:00,840
I think that's enough.

681
01:07:00,841 --> 01:07:13,880
I mean, that's another thing they have in common is that you, which you'd expect, that you're so involved in the world that you can't step back and make rational decisions about the value of being in the world.

682
01:07:13,881 --> 01:07:19,001
Okay, so next time, bring gay science because we're going to read the madman.
