1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
God is dead.

2
00:00:01,681 --> 00:00:06,640
That is the monotheistic Supreme Being.

3
00:00:06,961 --> 00:00:12,521
It isn't as if there's nobody, by the way, left in the culture who believes in the monotheistic Supreme Being.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,520
It's just once upon a time we had a religious culture where everybody did.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,321
Or if you didn't believe in the Supreme Being, you had to give an explanation.

6
00:00:23,321 --> 00:00:38,281
Now we've got a secular culture in which the general view is irreligious, naturalistic, atheistic, or nihilistic or variations thereof.

7
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:46,120
So now, if you believe in the Christian God, you have to give the arguments for why you do.

8
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:57,240
Then that's the sense in which God isn't anymore sort of the taken-for-granted center of the culture, which we all agree on and which gives us values that we all agree on.

9
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:08,601
So all you have to do is find out what the Bible tells you or the church tells you about these things, and then everybody knows what then there's shared intelligibility.

10
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:12,281
It's not a bad idea, but it doesn't happen anymore.

11
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:19,160
And that's the sense in which Nietzsche's thought early on that there's something switched in the culture.

12
00:01:19,161 --> 00:01:21,400
It's become a secular culture.

13
00:01:22,841 --> 00:01:27,321
And then the interesting claim that Christianity undermined itself.

14
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:36,041
And remember, I said, this is sort of a quote I owe you, which I couldn't find, about the way it undermined it.

15
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,001
Well, two quotes.

16
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:50,520
On 178, the general quote: Christianity, too, has made a great contribution to the Enlightenment and taught moral skepticism very trenchantly and effectively.

17
00:01:51,161 --> 00:01:54,001
It's destroyed the faith and virtues and so forth.

18
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:55,280
Never mind that part.

19
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:14,240
The idea that Christian confession and so forth have made people very sensitive and critical to their inward desires and to whether they're fooling themselves about their desires has helped undermine the Christian story.

20
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:22,640
Once upon a time, there's a kind of interesting story, I think, in here, which I didn't realize until this year.

21
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,521
There seem to be two contradictory views.

22
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:30,721
One, that Christianity has become so critical that it done itself in.

23
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:34,401
And I'm going to read you one that I was looking for last time.

24
00:02:34,401 --> 00:02:37,360
Christians aren't critical, and they should be.

25
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:44,000
This is where I said that it looks like he's criticizing Alyasha and religious experiences.

26
00:02:44,321 --> 00:02:47,760
And so here's this is an important one.

27
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,920
And I'll tell you what I think.

28
00:02:49,920 --> 00:03:11,120
I think that he's got one view of how normal Christians normally behaved, or maybe still behave, and how really sort of cultivated Christians behave, and they've become more and more critical until they've become critical of the very idea that there is a God.

29
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,720
But now we're going back.

30
00:03:12,721 --> 00:03:26,881
Here's how you can either say the original Christians behave, because after all, Dostoevsky is trying to get back to them, or how the current Dostoevsky-like Christians behave, which haven't got the news that God is dead.

31
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,601
The middle of 253.

32
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:34,960
And as interpreters of our experiences, that one, 319 aphorism.

33
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:39,721
One sort of honesty has been alien to all founders of religion and their kind.

34
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:46,601
See, you can view Dostoevsky as trying to get back to the mentality of these founders.

35
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:50,841
They have never made their experiences a matter of conscience for knowledge.

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,560
That's what people are doing now.

37
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:57,320
Now that we ask, what did I really experience?

38
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:08,680
This is what Alyasha should be asking himself, according to Nietzsche, and would be if he were a really sort of a cutting-edge Christian, but he's in the Russian back woods, Nietzsche would think.

39
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,281
What did I really experience?

40
00:04:10,281 --> 00:04:12,841
What happened in me and around me at that time?

41
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:14,760
Was my reason bright enough?

42
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:20,360
Was my will opposed to all deceptions of the senses and bold in resisting the fantastic?

43
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,880
None of them have asked such questions, nor do any of our dear religious people ask them even now.

44
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,721
See, those are the people who are still like the early ones.

45
00:04:29,721 --> 00:04:38,121
On the contrary, these people, the original ones and even the current Dostoevsky ones, thirst after things that go against reason.

46
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,601
And they do not wish to make it too hard for themselves to satisfy it.

47
00:04:42,601 --> 00:04:48,281
So they experience miracles and rebirths and hear the voices of little angels.

48
00:04:48,281 --> 00:04:51,081
That was the passage I was trying to find.

49
00:04:51,401 --> 00:05:11,240
So, of course, it's complicated because Dostoevsky's ideas about miracles and rebirths and so forth are so different than the kind of credulous belief in miracles and rebirth that goes against science and our understanding of nature.

50
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:17,560
So these whole views sort of cross and mix each other and don't quite grab each other.

51
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:28,080
But Nietzsche certainly got a view that Alyosha should have been in a much more critical mind vis-à-vis his revelation.

52
00:05:28,401 --> 00:05:29,920
Did I say Dostoevsky?

53
00:05:23,401 --> 00:05:30,560
I mean Nietzsche.

54
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,880
Nietzsche should think that Alyasha should be in a more critical state.

55
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,841
vis-à-vis his big deal religious experience.

56
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:42,001
And of course, Dostoevsky thinks no.

57
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,360
I mean, nothing could be more absolutely overwhelming and therefore true because it's going to last for the rest of your life.

58
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,561
What more do you want than Alyacha's religious experience?

59
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,721
It isn't as if one or the other of them has got the right answer.

60
00:05:56,721 --> 00:06:24,240
But Nietzsche's at least just sort of aiming for a non-existentialized, modern Christian who hasn't understood that they had better be much more critical of any kind of notions of miracles and rebirths that have to do with sudden cures or faces appearing on veils and such things.

61
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:34,961
He thinks that kind of belief is something that either you should have, Christians should have already talked themselves out of or are talking themselves out of.

62
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,320
Question back there.

63
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:50,321
He says the most important thing in an final impossible is to be relying on instinct and not even...

64
00:06:50,561 --> 00:06:51,360
That's interesting.

65
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,121
That's very sensible.

66
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,520
I don't at first know what to say.

67
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,201
I have to think about it a minute.

68
00:06:57,201 --> 00:07:03,601
I do think there are all these cross currents going, and now you've added a cross-current within Nietzsche himself.

69
00:07:03,601 --> 00:07:13,161
Yes, Nietzsche thinks you should be impulsive, rely on instinct, don't sort of get detached and analyze.

70
00:07:13,481 --> 00:07:30,680
He's got that whole story that Socrates is decadent and the Athenian Greeks because they step back from their sort of involvement and stop to analyze and criticize and then destroy sort of their commitment.

71
00:07:30,681 --> 00:07:31,481
Good point.

72
00:07:31,481 --> 00:07:34,441
How is he going to get these two things together?

73
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:41,961
Well, this may be a lesson in Nietzsche that you can't expect Nietzsche to sort of add up into one coherent system.

74
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,280
He doesn't want to do it.

75
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,880
He doesn't want a coherent system.

76
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,841
I think he thinks that's part of philosophy and metaphysics.

77
00:07:48,841 --> 00:08:07,481
He wants a lot of perspectives and interpretations, but he doesn't want, he doesn't and he doesn't mind, I think, maybe even if they contradict each other and would say something like, well, in some situations, this is, I think, Nietzsche's way of answering, in some situations, you better be self-critical.

78
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:16,281
If what's going on is something that goes against nature and the rest of common sense, and you're going to build your whole life on it, you better be critical of it.

79
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:27,641
In other situations, the best thing you can do is trust your instincts and go with them, and there's no higher position in which to tell you which kind of situations you could do which.

80
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,601
That's already a question of everybody has their own interpretation.

81
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,841
That's my best answer to you.

82
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,481
It's something like that in Nietzsche.

83
00:08:37,481 --> 00:08:43,401
Nietzsche's got and and Nietzsche says anything that he thinks is true from any perspective.

84
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:45,400
And he's got lots of perspectives.

85
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,640
And he thinks there is only perspectives.

86
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,841
There's not, remember, one answer that adds up to the truth.

87
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:53,481
That's part of what it is to believe in God.

88
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:12,881
That's part of why scientists still and metaphysicians are still believers in God in this sense where now God isn't the Christian supreme being, but is what the Greeks and the Christians both believe in, namely one unified, objective truth.

89
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,321
So that there must be some right answer to what's happening.

90
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:18,641
There's no right answer to what's happening.

91
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,001
It's all interpretation, all the way down.

92
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,201
I haven't read the interpretation passages, have I?

93
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:27,681
Okay, I've got to write a note to myself.

94
00:09:27,921 --> 00:09:29,520
Split through the cracks somehow.

95
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,081
I haven't said that, except just asserted it.

96
00:09:32,081 --> 00:09:33,760
I haven't read any passage ever.

97
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,561
I don't think so.

98
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:35,521
Did I?

99
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,641
No, I don't know.

100
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,841
It's fine.

101
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,801
Bring it up now, but I better write it down.

102
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:42,481
Okay, good question.

103
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:47,521
That really brought out something important.

104
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,481
Okay, so now we're critical.

105
00:09:52,801 --> 00:10:02,321
And now that's all the sort of bits of leftovers from last time that I promised to read you, like the Voices of Little Angels passage, which I couldn't find.

106
00:10:02,321 --> 00:10:06,481
Now I'm going on to where we were last time, still a little bit of reviewing.

107
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:27,041
We've talked about the collapse of all meaning because the cataclysm that occurs uniquely in a civilization, in a culture that has been completely monotheistic and built all of their values into one God and one religion, and then loses that.

108
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,921
Then there is this total collapse.

109
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:40,681
And now we've also, we talked about that, and we talked about how it's going to cause all kinds of chaos and disaster because nobody will have any guidelines anymore.

110
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,000
And that for Nietzsche, it's cheerfulness.

111
00:10:43,961 --> 00:10:47,801
That's the 279 important passage.

112
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,241
I want to go on about cheerfulness now.

113
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,921
What kind of cheerfulness can you have?

114
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,721
Well, you can't get meaning back.

115
00:10:57,721 --> 00:10:59,401
Remember, we talked about that.

116
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:07,241
You burn the bridges behind you when you put everything into one basket and then lose the basket, so to speak.

117
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:16,521
There's no going back to the old unified, rationally justified or justified by revelation world.

118
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:21,641
When once everybody realizes that God is dead, that's finished.

119
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,201
So what do you do?

120
00:11:24,201 --> 00:11:30,601
Well, the short-term statement of it is: we must become gods ourselves.

121
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:32,760
But what in the world does that mean?

122
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,161
Now we've caught up to where we were.

123
00:11:36,441 --> 00:11:41,321
We want to understand what it is to live like a free spirit.

124
00:11:41,321 --> 00:12:04,201
Because Nietzsche's name for the people who are cheerful and know how to live and live better than anybody ever lived, thanks to this collapse, who have got a new health, who have got because they have, they're, so to speak, the cultural convalescence who have survived this disaster and therefore are stronger than ever, or anybody ever was.

125
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:07,241
Okay, the free spirits, we've got to understand.

126
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,521
A whole new way of life.

127
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,520
Nietzsche understands, and this is where he's so fascinating.

128
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:29,201
And today is perhaps the most, I hope, fascinating lecture because it's what's really interesting is that Nietzsche understands that he's got to invent a whole new understanding of values.

129
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,321
What makes life worth living?

130
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:38,081
What are human beings at their best doing, etc.?

131
00:12:38,081 --> 00:12:52,641
I mean, he's got to start from scratch and substitute a whole new way of understanding us and the world and our life in the world for this complete collapse.

132
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,321
And there's nothing to, almost nothing to go on.

133
00:12:56,321 --> 00:13:00,321
But there is one clue for him, and he takes it.

134
00:13:00,721 --> 00:13:09,441
But first, let me just say, he knows that he's trying to invent a whole new set, a whole new set of values, as he puts it.

135
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:18,481
It comes up at the bottom of 265, for instance, the creation of our own new tables of what is good.

136
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:27,360
That's that the most important statement of it, and I think there are other places, but the one you've got in your hands, if you brought Twilight, which I didn't tell you to do.

137
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:42,081
But anyway, the last sentence of Twilight, sorry, of Antichrist, which is the last sentence of that book that you've got, is he's going to talk about the re-evaluation of all values.

138
00:13:42,081 --> 00:13:48,321
Which book does he, some of you may know Nietzsche better than I do, which book does he have as the epigraph?

139
00:13:48,321 --> 00:13:48,960
This is the book.

140
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,641
Is that the genealogy of morals?

141
00:13:50,961 --> 00:13:55,041
One of them says this book is the re-evaluation of all values.

142
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,801
Or is it Beyond Good and Evil?

143
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,800
Anyway, he knows that that's what he's up to.

144
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,001
And he even says that that's what one of his books is about.

145
00:14:02,481 --> 00:14:03,681
Somebody has a hand up.

146
00:14:03,681 --> 00:14:04,240
You have?

147
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,801
Good.

148
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,240
I thought Laura's the entire category was on the philosophy.

149
00:14:10,681 --> 00:14:12,041
Terrific question.

150
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:14,521
Absolutely the right question to ask.

151
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:26,041
The answer is: if he gave you any specific values, he would be contradicting himself in a way that even Nietzsche, who doesn't mind contradictions, wouldn't want to do it.

152
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,681
There's no more universal truths.

153
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:33,481
There's no more values that everybody can see our values and agree on.

154
00:14:33,481 --> 00:14:38,121
Well, what in the world has he got then as new values?

155
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,921
Well, they're sort of meta-values.

156
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:48,440
It's really the values of having no new values, but that you have to explain how that could be a value.

157
00:14:48,441 --> 00:14:50,120
That's what he's up to.

158
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,281
And how do you do that?

159
00:14:54,280 --> 00:15:03,000
Well, you do it by, remember I said there's one thing which he holds on, one idea which he holds on to as the kind of guideline.

160
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,561
He's got to have something to go on.

161
00:15:05,561 --> 00:15:07,241
And I said it last time.

162
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:14,760
The one value that he accepts and is going to build all this on is life.

163
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:21,401
We are part of life, and life is constant overcoming and outgrowing.

164
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,760
And of course, that's a funny kind of value.

165
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,520
It's no particular value.

166
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,280
It says, in fact, just what he said.

167
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:35,320
Nietzsche's against you thinking you've got some universal, eternal value to hang on to.

168
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,560
But there is something to hang on to.

169
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:44,521
You want to be powerful, healthy, expanding, constantly overcoming.

170
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:52,120
Those are all the kind of values that he's putting on when he transvaluates the table of values.

171
00:15:52,441 --> 00:15:58,400
And one of the places I got it, I marked it where I find it on 291 at the bottom.

172
00:15:53,240 --> 00:16:12,000
The wish to preserve oneself is the symptom of a condition of distress at a limitation, distress, of a limitation of the really fundamental instinct of life, which aims at the expansion of power.

173
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,481
That's just one of the places where he says it.

174
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:32,161
And he says, and at the end of that aphorism on 292, the great and small struggle always revolves around superiority, around growth and expansion, around power, in accordance with the will to power, which is the will of life.

175
00:16:32,481 --> 00:16:34,401
So you see what I mean?

176
00:16:34,401 --> 00:16:40,961
I mean, you're right, no fixed, no universal values, but a new table of values nonetheless.

177
00:16:40,961 --> 00:16:45,760
That's now what is it that everybody can't help but pursuing?

178
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,800
But some of them are so weak they don't do it very well.

179
00:16:48,800 --> 00:17:00,961
But the more, the better the human being, the more they understand that their job is to have this, to do this living thing.

180
00:17:00,961 --> 00:17:03,921
Now, what the living thing is, I haven't explained yet.

181
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:05,760
We have to understand that.

182
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:23,920
But whatever it is, just to say it again, this person in tune with life and constantly going beyond wherever they are, growing, expanding, and so forth, they are the free spirit or the new man.

183
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:27,040
And that's what we got to find out about.

184
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,441
So, I've talked about everything, but page, did I do page 100?

185
00:17:31,441 --> 00:17:32,800
I don't think so.

186
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,280
No, one more quote.

187
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,881
The middle of 100.

188
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:37,920
What is life?

189
00:17:37,921 --> 00:17:42,361
Life, that is, is constantly shedding something that wants to die.

190
00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:51,000
Life, that is, being true and cruel and inexorable against everything about us that is growing old and weak, and not only about us.

191
00:17:51,800 --> 00:18:00,760
Anybody, who's old and weak, anything old and weak, you could be cruel and try to put it out of its misery.

192
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,560
Yeah.

193
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:08,760
Hang on, you sort of forgot those guys that didn't want to.

194
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,401
Yes, well, yeah, we've got to be careful.

195
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:13,240
I forget, did you say the Homeric Greeks?

196
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,040
You've got to be, you know, you're very careful when you say Greeks.

197
00:18:16,441 --> 00:18:17,800
I'm sure that's what you meant.

198
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:43,080
The question is whether the Homeric Greeks have somehow already got a sense of this, which the culture has lost thanks to the Athenian Greeks, those decadent and weak Plato and Aristotle trying to find universal moral principles, and thanks to the Hebrews and Christians, those decadents trying to find the same kind of universal principles by revelation.

199
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,760
The Homeric Greeks were happily polytheists.

200
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,880
We get to that now.

201
00:18:47,881 --> 00:18:49,640
He really likes that.

202
00:18:49,641 --> 00:18:53,641
But that would jump me way ahead of where I'm in my lecture.

203
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:54,441
You do this.

204
00:18:54,441 --> 00:18:59,800
But let me see if I can do that and still come back without confusing things.

205
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,320
Let's try it.

206
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:03,721
Yeah, okay.

207
00:19:03,721 --> 00:19:06,520
There are two things one could talk about at this point.

208
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:12,360
I was going to talk about the way the current free spirits should live.

209
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:14,601
And that is having brief habits.

210
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,961
Just put that in aside for a while.

211
00:19:17,961 --> 00:19:21,161
It'll take at least half an hour when I get back to it.

212
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:36,081
But we could instead, instead of starting with how you should live as a free spirit now, we could start with how did the people who were nearest to free spirits before all this decadence set in lived, and that would be the Greeks.

213
00:19:36,401 --> 00:19:40,160
So let's look on the Homeric Greeks on 242.

214
00:19:40,161 --> 00:19:46,160
Okay, this is about the happiest of 302.

215
00:19:46,161 --> 00:19:49,841
To have refined senses, including a sense of taste and so forth.

216
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,040
We don't need that.

217
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:59,681
To enjoy a strong, bold, audacious soul, to go through life with a calm eye and firm step, always prepared to risk all.

218
00:19:59,681 --> 00:20:01,840
That's part of the free spirit.

219
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,520
Festively impelled by the longing for undiscovered worlds.

220
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:12,080
See, going beyond, to undiscovered worlds and seas, people, and gods.

221
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,840
We're going to come back to that a lot.

222
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:37,840
It's the constant discovery of new stuff, new horizons, new worlds, new gods, to hearken to all cheerful music as if it were a sign that bold men, soldiers, and seafarers were seeking their rest and pleasure, and in the most profound enjoyment of the moment to be overcome by tears and crimson melancholy of the happy.

223
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,681
Who would not wish all this might be his possession, his state?

224
00:20:41,681 --> 00:20:43,681
That was the happiness of Homer.

225
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:46,400
So that's the answer that you were pointing to.

226
00:20:46,401 --> 00:20:53,201
Yes, the nearest thing to what he wants people to have is what the Greeks, what the Homeric Greeks had.

227
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:57,201
And he finds it in polytheism.

228
00:20:57,201 --> 00:20:59,920
Now we're on page 191.

229
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,481
The greatest advantage of polytheism.

230
00:21:04,481 --> 00:21:10,441
For an individual to posit his own ideals and derive from it his own laws, joys, and rights.

231
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:13,800
Remember, keep your eye on what he said.

232
00:21:14,121 --> 00:21:21,400
He can't be proposing any particular laws or rights, but each person has their own.

233
00:21:21,401 --> 00:21:28,760
And that may well have been considered hitherto the most outrageous human aberration as idolatry itself.

234
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:46,601
I mean, he thinks that up to the Homeric Greeks and their kind of polytheism, every culture was trying to make everybody into conformists, because that's how cultures work best and start indoctrinating their children into the universal principles.

235
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,840
He talks a lot about that sort of training, which he's against.

236
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,280
But now let's go on.

237
00:21:52,280 --> 00:22:03,240
The few who dared as much, that is, to make up their own laws, always felt the need to apologize to themselves, saying, it wasn't I, not I, but a god through me.

238
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:13,961
The wonderful art and gift of creating gods, polytheism, was the medium through which this impulse could discharge, purify, protect, perfect, and ennoble itself.

239
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:23,641
Skipping down now, the bad thing is, about five lines down, there was only one norm, man, and every people thought that it possessed this one ultimate norm.

240
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:24,601
That's what I just said.

241
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:34,120
Every culture has some idea of what the essence of human being is, what human beings are here for, what human beings ought to do that's good, what human beings shouldn't do that's bad.

242
00:22:34,441 --> 00:22:42,760
But above and outside, in some distance overworld, one was permitted to behold, and now what the Greeks saw, a plurality of norms.

243
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:47,880
One God was not considered a denial of another God or blasphemy against him.

244
00:22:47,881 --> 00:23:03,681
The invention, skipping a little, of gods, heroes, and overmen of all kinds, as well as near men, and undermen and dwarfs and fairies and so forth and so forth, was the inestimable preliminary exercise for the justification of the egoism and sovereignty of the individual.

245
00:23:03,681 --> 00:23:15,441
Remember, egoism is a good thing, because that means that you are making up your own laws and doing what you decided is a good thing for you to do.

246
00:23:15,441 --> 00:23:19,201
Now, of course, that makes monotheism the enemy going on.

247
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:34,320
Monotheism, on the other hand, this rigid consequences of the doctrine of one normal human type, that is, one human nature, the faith in one normal God, besides whom there are only pseudo-gods, that's the supreme being.

248
00:23:34,641 --> 00:23:39,600
There are lots of idol worshipper gods and lesser gods, but that's the creator god.

249
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,240
The faith in one normal God, and so forth, was perhaps the greatest danger that has yet confronted humanity.

250
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,920
He had plunged humanity into 2,000 years of darkness, he would say.

251
00:23:51,921 --> 00:24:01,681
The only happy news is that out of that sickness, finally, the culture overcame it and became healthier than ever, namely Nietzsche.

252
00:24:01,681 --> 00:24:03,441
But it was a close shave.

253
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:04,721
Now, the end of the paragraph.

254
00:24:04,721 --> 00:24:19,040
In polytheism, the free-spiriting and many-spiriting of man attained its first preliminary form: the strength to create for ourselves, and this is now typical, our own new eyes, and ever again new eyes, ever more our own.

255
00:24:19,681 --> 00:24:23,681
That means new interpretations, new ways of looking at things.

256
00:24:23,681 --> 00:24:26,880
There are always more possible new ways of looking at things.

257
00:24:26,881 --> 00:24:30,081
As I'll say more later, artists are his model of this.

258
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:36,961
There's an endless number of new ways to see the world, to paint the world, to make buildings, to make music, and so forth.

259
00:24:36,961 --> 00:24:40,520
And the free spirit is doing something like that.

260
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,321
Though they may be, and I'll get back to that later too, turning their own life into a work of art.

261
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,681
That's okay, too.

262
00:24:46,921 --> 00:24:50,360
But polytheism was the beginning of that.

263
00:24:50,361 --> 00:24:52,760
And now comes a crucial sentence.

264
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:56,600
Ever get new eyes, more our own.

265
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,800
Hence, man alone among all animals has no eternal horizons and perspectives.

266
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,560
That's a funny line.

267
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:17,000
If you've thought about, for instance, Kierkegaard, Kierkegaard thinks that animals, like the caterpillar that turns into a butterfly and might turn into a fish, are just exactly not eternal.

268
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:25,961
What's great about human beings is they can get the eternal in time and get an identity that they have all their lives.

269
00:25:25,961 --> 00:25:28,280
But animals go changing all the time.

270
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:33,000
And Nietzsche just flips that around and says, no, no, animals never change.

271
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,081
They've got their fixed way of being, cats or dogs or even caterpillars and butterflies.

272
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,201
They always do turn from caterpillars to butterflies.

273
00:25:42,201 --> 00:25:45,000
It's all built into their genes.

274
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,880
It's just that that's what that species does.

275
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:51,961
Species are eternal, in the sense now Nietzsche's eternal.

276
00:25:51,961 --> 00:25:57,640
Namely, they can't change, they can't get new eyes, they can't get new understandings.

277
00:25:57,641 --> 00:25:59,721
Only human beings can change.

278
00:25:59,721 --> 00:26:21,481
And so now it turns out that for Nietzsche, what Kierkegaard called lower immediacy, namely being able to change your nature and never having anything fixed and eternal about your nature, that man is constantly reinventing what it is to be a human being, that turns out to be the highest thing.

279
00:26:21,481 --> 00:26:23,920
That's a new kind of higher immediacy.

280
00:26:22,121 --> 00:26:26,400
That's a Nietzsche kind of higher immediacy.

281
00:26:26,401 --> 00:26:29,120
Constantly reinventing yourself.

282
00:26:23,401 --> 00:26:30,641
We'll get back to that.

283
00:26:30,961 --> 00:26:33,520
But we can do it in this order.

284
00:26:35,201 --> 00:26:38,000
So now, yes, I just want to.

285
00:26:38,641 --> 00:26:42,880
So, yes, so we can create, I'm going to keep track of these way of doing this now.

286
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:51,681
We can create new gods and give our life a new style, and animals can't do this.

287
00:26:51,681 --> 00:26:56,240
Man is, as Nietzsche says somewhere else, the underdetermined animal.

288
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,880
That is, man has no nature.

289
00:26:58,881 --> 00:27:01,041
That makes Nietzsche an existentialist.

290
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:05,760
Remember, in the very beginning, I said Pascal says that custom is our nature.

291
00:27:06,481 --> 00:27:09,360
That's a step in the right direction, Nietzsche would say.

292
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:16,800
Only you shouldn't let custom give all the people in your culture your nature, even relative to your culture.

293
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:21,360
Each individual should give themselves their version of human nature.

294
00:27:21,361 --> 00:27:22,961
That doesn't have any content.

295
00:27:22,961 --> 00:27:25,360
It doesn't offer any guidelines.

296
00:27:25,361 --> 00:27:29,600
It's way beyond metaphysics and revelation.

297
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,360
And in a certain, so far, so good.

298
00:27:33,681 --> 00:27:34,400
Yeah, a hand.

299
00:27:34,401 --> 00:27:34,641
Okay.

300
00:27:34,641 --> 00:27:35,760
Has that been your hand up long?

301
00:27:35,841 --> 00:27:38,161
I suddenly felt the strange power from over there.

302
00:27:38,161 --> 00:27:39,360
Go ahead.

303
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:46,161
Ah, well, yes, Sartre, of course, is living off Nietzsche, like all of the existential thinkers.

304
00:27:46,401 --> 00:27:52,481
Sartre thinks that there is no human nature, and we had existence precedes essence.

305
00:27:52,481 --> 00:27:59,041
And he says this: how many have read the Sartre existentialism as a humanism in high school?

306
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,240
Probably several.

307
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,240
Okay, but Sartre sort of blows it.

308
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:09,721
He even was sort of ashamed of that talk, and tried to keep it from being published and reproduced, and now everybody reads it.

309
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:19,721
Because then he said, but each person who chooses chooses for all human beings, remember, and turns it into something universal, which makes no sense because what about these other human beings?

310
00:28:19,721 --> 00:28:21,721
They're supposed to be choosing for themselves.

311
00:28:21,721 --> 00:28:23,481
So how could you choose for them?

312
00:28:23,481 --> 00:28:25,721
Each person, that just contradictory.

313
00:28:25,721 --> 00:28:33,000
But he was trying to be to sort of make existentialism look less radical for some reason or other at that point.

314
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,560
I guess to make it more acceptable to people.

315
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,721
But he was losing it.

316
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:48,201
So Sartre took the part of it that he should have been the main part of it, that existence precedes essence, that human beings have no nature.

317
00:28:48,201 --> 00:28:49,961
That's the Nietzsche claim.

318
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:50,840
Go ahead.

319
00:28:51,161 --> 00:29:06,441
He would assume the entire universe for all persons I can't come describing a person unable to experience everyone else, unable to purely know how things are experienced by another person.

320
00:29:06,441 --> 00:29:13,080
And because of that, that if you choose, you choose, because you are the only human that actually can experience what you're experiencing.

321
00:29:14,201 --> 00:29:15,481
But that's good.

322
00:29:15,481 --> 00:29:21,161
But then doesn't he also say that and you do it as if you were choosing for everybody?

323
00:29:21,481 --> 00:29:22,521
Well, good.

324
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:27,081
I mean, maybe that we could go back and look and see if we can help us help him out that way.

325
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,080
But since he's not in the course, we won't we I won't worry about it.

326
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,681
You guys can go back and look.

327
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:46,360
But but if you at least we can all agree that he's that Nietzsche and Sartre are following out what Pascal started, namely that human beings have no essence.

328
00:29:46,681 --> 00:29:54,560
In Kierkegaard, it's going to be tricky because it looks like they've got a self with a lot of content and structure.

329
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,441
The way I read Kierkegaard is like Pascal.

330
00:29:53,320 --> 00:30:00,321
That is, Christianity has created a human being.

331
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:06,000
Remember, Nietzsche thinks that Christianity creates a certain kind of human being, namely a meaning addict.

332
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,321
And Kierkegaard would think, too, only where Nietzsche thinks that's sick.

333
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,840
Kierkegaard would say that's the culmination of human culture.

334
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:20,481
Christianity created a self which has to have an unconditioned commitment in order to stay out of despair.

335
00:30:20,481 --> 00:30:27,040
But it's still nothing, it's not human nature, if I understand Kierkegaard.

336
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,800
It's this particular Christian culture which did it.

337
00:30:31,441 --> 00:30:39,120
But then Nietzsche goes one step beyond Kierkegaard because it isn't something that's shared by every Christian anyway.

338
00:30:39,121 --> 00:30:45,360
It's each person on their own has to choose what it is to be a human being and live by that.

339
00:30:45,361 --> 00:30:50,320
And then we're at Sartre, which is fine.

340
00:30:50,961 --> 00:30:51,760
Okay?

341
00:30:52,721 --> 00:30:58,080
I think that's, you guys are getting it as far as I can tell by looking at you.

342
00:30:58,641 --> 00:31:02,640
So there's one more little wrinkle on it.

343
00:31:02,641 --> 00:31:04,240
I mean, we could stop right there.

344
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:29,441
But I think it's interesting in the light of the third man movie and Orson Welles' great speech, which we haven't really done enough justice to, that of course all the people who are free are free spirits and have become gods themselves in the sense that they are defining their world and their eyes and so forth.

345
00:31:29,441 --> 00:31:33,120
All of them will naturally naturally be perceived as evil.

346
00:31:33,121 --> 00:31:44,681
That's because, of course, they're denying the current world and its values and acting against them, or at least as if they had no claim on them.

347
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,240
This is what Anietch is talking about on page 79.

348
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:54,681
The strongest and most evil spirits have done the most to advance humanity.

349
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,280
What does that mean?

350
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:04,520
Well, it means that, skipping down, they have been toppling boundary markers, violating pieties.

351
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:11,240
Oh, there's this great quote very near the end of the book, which I wanted to bring in but didn't see how.

352
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,280
Now I can see.

353
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:18,040
On 347, you can see how they're violating pieties.

354
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:23,880
They confront about the last eight lines of the cop aphorism.

355
00:32:23,881 --> 00:32:25,481
These are the free spirits.

356
00:32:25,481 --> 00:32:37,481
They confront all earthly seriousness so far, all solemnity in gesture, word, tone, eye, morality, and task, as if it were their most incarnated involuntary parody.

357
00:32:37,481 --> 00:32:41,161
In spite of all this, okay, that's enough.

358
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:47,800
That they laugh at the current rules, at the sacred, and so forth.

359
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:50,201
So let's go back to 79.

360
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:58,520
In every teacher and preacher of what is new, we encounter the same wickedness that made conquerors notorious, skipping down.

361
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:06,681
What's new, however, is always evil, being that which wants to conquer and overthrow the old boundary markers and old pieties.

362
00:33:07,241 --> 00:33:10,040
And only what is old is good.

363
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:32,241
Yeah, okay, so now you can, and that, remember, is supposed to be in the Orson Welles version, the famous line in that under the borgias, we had there was bloodshed and murder, and I forget all the bad things that happened, and they produced Leonardo and Michelangelo and so forth.

364
00:33:32,241 --> 00:33:36,321
Under the Swiss, there was 2,000 years of democracy and peace.

365
00:33:36,321 --> 00:33:38,000
And what did they produce, Holly?

366
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,360
The cuckoo clock.

367
00:33:39,361 --> 00:33:53,040
I mean, that's a very Nietzschean speech that says it's only the people who are changing worlds who are advancing the human race, and they're advancing the human race by destroying the current world and setting up new values.

368
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,441
And that's what human beings do.

369
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:59,040
They're the only animal that does that.

370
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:04,321
And when they do that, they are doing sort of they are at their best.

371
00:34:04,321 --> 00:34:12,241
And the Swiss are just the normal, boring, conservative people who preserve what is to go on.

372
00:34:12,241 --> 00:34:14,241
They preserve what is old and good.

373
00:34:14,241 --> 00:34:21,200
The good men are in all ages, those who dig the old thoughts and so forth and so forth.

374
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,360
Did I see another hand there?

375
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:23,680
Yeah.

376
00:34:26,961 --> 00:34:28,081
Absolutely.

377
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,681
And it's, we're going to get to that, but I can say it already.

378
00:34:31,921 --> 00:34:37,840
When you get some new values established, then they pretty soon become old values.

379
00:34:37,841 --> 00:34:46,081
And then people begin to think that's the right way to behave, or the person who has them begins to think if it's an individual, that's the right way to behave.

380
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:50,720
And then they've lost something crucial, which I haven't explained yet.

381
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,321
And if I just jump in here with it, it'll only confuse you.

382
00:34:54,321 --> 00:35:02,561
We haven't really said what you get out of life if you live in this free spirit way.

383
00:35:02,961 --> 00:35:09,401
But you ought to be able to see that one sure thing you don't get is some kind of eternal meaning.

384
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:22,520
So Nietzsche is going to have to, if you're going to reevaluate values, give you a new understanding of what it is like to live life at its best, what experience, how that feels.

385
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,201
I'm going to read that in just a minute, but keep that in mind.

386
00:35:26,200 --> 00:36:03,321
But I want to just do one more thing with the thing we're following out, and that is he has this very interesting idea that these new people who change the culture by changing the values do it by picking up some old values that were once important and then got routinized until they didn't have any power anymore and bring them back in such a way that they get new power.

387
00:36:03,321 --> 00:36:05,640
I think that's because of the Homeric Greeks.

388
00:36:06,361 --> 00:36:10,520
There's a kind of circle in this lecture, it turns out.

389
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:15,721
That is, it's a very interesting idea.

390
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:27,800
It means that there are sort of marginal practices around from other stages of the culture, which you could go back and retrieve and make important again in some new way.

391
00:36:27,801 --> 00:36:35,000
I mean, we can't go back to Homeric polytheism for sure, but Melival and Moby Dick wants a new polytheism.

392
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,360
I've mentioned that before.

393
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:40,201
That's the story of Philosophy VI, with the way I think about it.

394
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:54,000
But here's just the general idea, which is so interesting, of how you get, how you find something to sort of hang on to, to start a new world around, by picking up something from the past.

395
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,321
It's an unusual thing.

396
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:02,161
Nietzsche calls it in one place a leap from the wings to center stage.

397
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:13,281
That means some marginal practice which is still around, you convert it into some central practice, and you make the central practice marginal.

398
00:37:13,281 --> 00:37:14,720
That's how you change a world.

399
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,361
That's really an interesting, original idea.

400
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:20,081
So here it is on 84.

401
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:30,801
I prefer to understand the rare human beings of an age as suddenly emerging, late ghosts of past cultures and their powers, as atavisms of a people and its mores.

402
00:37:30,801 --> 00:37:33,920
That way one really can understand a little about them.

403
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:42,481
You see, if they were totally strange, just totally, utterly unrelated to the past, you wouldn't be able to make any sense out of them at all.

404
00:37:42,481 --> 00:37:45,840
Now they seem strange, rare, extraordinary.

405
00:37:45,841 --> 00:37:58,080
And whoever feels these powers in himself must nurse, defend, honor, and cultivate them against another world that resists them until he becomes either a great human being or a mad and eccentric one who perishes early.

406
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:06,401
Now that's interesting, because one way is to become a new, important, powerful human being.

407
00:38:06,401 --> 00:38:15,280
I'm going to argue next time that, according to Nietzsche, Jesus was in the prank.

408
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:31,121
But you could, and this gets us to, well, if you had a whole new way of looking at things, like Jesus might, almost totally different than the Hebrews, though not quite, otherwise, it wouldn't make any sense at all.

409
00:38:31,761 --> 00:38:36,641
Then, and one possibility is that you transform the world.

410
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,761
That's what Jesus did, He created the Christian world.

411
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:55,241
But another possibility is you go crazy because there's not enough in what you under, there's not enough overlap between what you suddenly see in a new way and any way that anybody has ever seen anything before.

412
00:38:55,241 --> 00:38:57,481
Who am I sort of thinking about now?

413
00:38:57,801 --> 00:39:05,560
Who goes crazy because he understands something the way Jesus must have understood it?

414
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:08,281
Who's the Jesus figure in the brothers?

415
00:39:08,281 --> 00:39:09,320
Markle.

416
00:39:09,321 --> 00:39:13,320
Markle has such an incredibly crazy vision of the world.

417
00:39:13,321 --> 00:39:18,120
Remember, to us, Markle makes some sense, but to Markle, Markle didn't make much sense.

418
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,641
Now he says you should wash the feet of your servants.

419
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:27,721
But in an age when the servants were servants and the bosses were bosses, that was just outrageous.

420
00:39:27,961 --> 00:39:32,040
And Markle didn't know what he was talking about, except that that's what he felt.

421
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:36,600
And he felt that you must love the birds and so forth and ask even the forgiveness of the birds.

422
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,000
That's even too outrageous for Christianity.

423
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,680
Christianity doesn't believe that.

424
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,000
I mean, St.

425
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:48,360
Francis believes it, but it's certainly not anywhere in the Credo that you have to love the birds and ask their forgiveness.

426
00:39:48,361 --> 00:39:50,601
And certainly, I don't think Luther thought so.

427
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:58,681
But so you can have a view so radically strange that you will go crazy.

428
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,720
That's what happened.

429
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,880
And Nietzsche is considering both.

430
00:40:01,881 --> 00:40:08,360
You either change the world, if you pick up enough pieces of the past, you can change the world.

431
00:40:08,361 --> 00:40:16,921
If you're really too utterly radically coming up with a new world, that's very powerful, but it's so dangerous that it will destroy you.

432
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:26,240
That's, I think, what Dostoevsky thinks happened with, well, Jesus is sort of in between.

433
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:32,161
I mean, it was radical enough so that it destroyed him, Dostoevsky thinks, using the Markle example.

434
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:42,241
But it was just enough understandable that it got caught up by the people who then took it to the monasteries and digested it and understood it and so forth.

435
00:40:42,241 --> 00:41:00,240
That's the three-stage version: a crazy stage, a socializing stage, and finally the stage where we are all in, according to Dostoevsky, the stage where Christianity is going to go out into the world and existentialize everything in a good way.

436
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,841
Okay, that's now back to where I was.

437
00:41:03,841 --> 00:41:09,841
I said the next thing we have to talk about is what it feels like to be a free spirit.

438
00:41:09,841 --> 00:41:11,920
But I was just stopping here.

439
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:17,760
I'm done with the new opening new worlds story for a while.

440
00:41:17,761 --> 00:41:19,040
I'll come back to it.

441
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,481
Okay, everybody's with it.

442
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,040
Your questions have been very, very on the mark.

443
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,840
So, okay, here's lots of different ways of being a free spirit.

444
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,000
There are at least three.

445
00:41:35,040 --> 00:42:03,520
But I'm going to start with, okay, I'm going to start with the one which I think is the most clear and original and gives you a sense of what sort of feeling could replace meaning and a sense of the eternal in time and a sense of your having an identity, all of which should give you bliss, according to Kierkegaard.

446
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:08,080
If you're going to throw all that out, what in the world are people going to live for?

447
00:42:08,281 --> 00:42:10,921
And why will they be joyful and get out?

448
00:42:10,921 --> 00:42:12,281
What will they get out of it?

449
00:42:12,281 --> 00:42:14,040
Okay, well, here we go.

450
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:23,881
We're going to have a new set of values, and Nietzsche is going to explain it first, sort of in a very down-to-earth way, as it is in his life.

451
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:29,000
I love this passage, which is nobody else needs to pay any attention to, as far as I know.

452
00:42:29,401 --> 00:42:33,721
On page 236, brief habits.

453
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:45,481
I think brief habits has just everything in it that you need to, at the simplest level, and then you just sort of magnify it enough and you get the whole big picture of the free spirit.

454
00:42:45,481 --> 00:42:57,241
So I love brief habits, he says at the bottom of 236, and consider them an inestimable means for getting to know many things and states down to the bottom of their sweetness and bitterness.

455
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:05,081
My nature is designed entirely for brief habits, and even the needs of my physical health and so forth and so forth.

456
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,720
Now, what is this brief habits story?

457
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,281
And now we get it.

458
00:43:10,281 --> 00:43:15,641
I always believe that here is something that will give me lasting satisfaction.

459
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,961
Brief habits, too, have the faith of passion, the faith in eternity.

460
00:43:19,961 --> 00:43:22,040
See, that's exactly Kierkegaard.

461
00:43:22,361 --> 00:43:24,361
I don't think he knew any Kierkegaard.

462
00:43:24,361 --> 00:43:25,881
He's inventing Kierkegaard.

463
00:43:25,881 --> 00:43:31,161
All these guys are so smart that they invent all the positions around where they are.

464
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:39,320
So passion, remember, faith for Kierkegaard is infinite passion, and it gives you eternity in time.

465
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:43,241
And now Nietzsche is certainly not proposing that.

466
00:43:43,241 --> 00:43:44,760
But it sounds like it.

467
00:43:44,761 --> 00:44:00,401
And he's saying, well, you can be so involved with someone or something that it seems to be your whole world and will be the main thing in your life forever in that special sense of forever.

468
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:06,561
But he says, and that I am, and going on, that I'm envied for having found and recognized.

469
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:11,040
That is, somebody you are infatuated with, some way of life.

470
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,881
He gives a whole list a little while later.

471
00:44:12,881 --> 00:44:27,040
And now it nourishes me at noon and in the evening and spreads a deep contentment all around itself and deep into me so that I desire nothing else without having any need for comparisons, contempt or hatred.

472
00:44:27,921 --> 00:44:29,921
Now comes the new mood.

473
00:44:30,241 --> 00:44:34,000
So far it might be any unconditional commitment.

474
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,161
But one day it's time is up.

475
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,160
No eternity for Nietzsche.

476
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:46,241
The good thing parts from me, not as something that's come to nauseate me, but peacefully and sated with me as I am with it.

477
00:44:46,241 --> 00:44:49,201
So in effect, you outgrow it.

478
00:44:49,600 --> 00:45:03,761
You love somebody, and after a while, I'm sort of skipping ahead of the story, it seems absolutely satisfying and makes you happy and happy with yourself and happy with the world.

479
00:45:03,761 --> 00:45:08,081
And then after a while, it stops working.

480
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,400
And then you just outgrow it.

481
00:45:10,881 --> 00:45:18,081
And then when you lose it, you don't feel grief the way you do when you lose your defining commitment.

482
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:22,000
Your world doesn't go blank and gray and so forth.

483
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,040
Not at all.

484
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:28,481
The old habit, the old person, the old commitment just says goodbye.

485
00:45:28,481 --> 00:45:31,760
And then even then, something new is waiting at the door.

486
00:45:31,921 --> 00:45:37,121
Along with my faith, the indestructible fool and sage that this new discovery will be just right.

487
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,481
This will be the last time.

488
00:45:39,321 --> 00:45:47,320
So that was infatuation, but next time it's going to be real love, or that was me being swept away by some city.

489
00:45:47,321 --> 00:45:53,081
He talks about doing feeling this for a city, and then it's never going to change again.

490
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,760
This happens to me with dishes.

491
00:45:54,761 --> 00:45:56,360
It's an amazing list.

492
00:45:56,361 --> 00:46:05,720
Dishes, ideas, human beings, cities, poems, music, doctrines, ways of arranging the day, and lifestyles.

493
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:20,361
They're all such that you can become completely hooked on them, absorbed in them, think that your life would be impossible without them, that you're going to have them forever, all the Dostoevsky, Kierkegaard, and Eternity story.

494
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:22,760
And moreover, you outgrow them.

495
00:46:22,761 --> 00:46:27,160
But every time you do, you feel then that the next one comes.

496
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:33,080
So sooner or later, mostly sooner, something else will come around that you're attached to in this way.

497
00:46:33,401 --> 00:46:37,481
And you'll feel you're never going to outgrow it, but you'll outgrow it.

498
00:46:37,481 --> 00:46:39,960
And now, what's going on there?

499
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:47,641
What's interesting to me was I sort of thought, why doesn't he experience grief?

500
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:54,921
Well, because whatever this grief habit commitment is, commitments the word he doesn't like.

501
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,000
Commitments are prisons.

502
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
So let's not call it a commitment.

503
00:46:59,801 --> 00:47:00,760
Absorption.

504
00:47:00,761 --> 00:47:26,241
Whatever this special kind of something that you get absorbed in in this way that seems completely satisfying is not giving you meaning, and it's not giving you an identity because meaning is something that you can't, you don't want to outgrow because we're meaning addicts, and your identity is something you don't want to lose, because I guess we're identity addicts too.

505
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:31,520
And so it can't be, and that would give you grief.

506
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,040
But this doesn't give you grief.

507
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,881
So what's he getting out of this kind of absorption?

508
00:47:36,881 --> 00:47:41,921
Well, what he's getting out of it is wonder, excitement.

509
00:47:41,921 --> 00:47:58,960
And as long as the city or the music or the person that you're with is exciting and constantly showing you new things, then you are happy, cheerful, to use his word.

510
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:16,320
But unlike meaning, into the very notion of what is fun, exciting, wonderful, is built the fact that it's going to wear down because it will presumably stop being fun eventually.

511
00:48:16,321 --> 00:48:17,761
It'll get boring.

512
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:19,921
And then you'll need a new one.

513
00:48:19,921 --> 00:48:21,600
Meaning doesn't do that.

514
00:48:21,841 --> 00:48:24,800
When you've got meaning, you don't get bored.

515
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:27,441
You want to hold on to it no matter what.

516
00:48:27,441 --> 00:48:30,160
And if you lose it, you go into grief.

517
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,961
Your world loses all.

518
00:48:34,241 --> 00:48:36,321
It stops being worth living.

519
00:48:38,401 --> 00:48:40,880
Now, here you see him right at works.

520
00:48:40,881 --> 00:48:51,760
They're inventing a new kind of value, but in this case, a new kind of feeling that goes with being a new kind of person, a free spirit.

521
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:56,801
I think it's helpful to see what happens to the meaning addicts.

522
00:48:56,801 --> 00:49:07,520
They all think that you've got to hold on to meanings, because if you don't, your world will collapse and your life will become meaningless.

523
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,200
And therefore, you should.

524
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,321
Now comes this interesting move.

525
00:49:13,321 --> 00:49:33,401
Either you either you think like Plato and Buddhists who have a lot in common about this, that you should never become completely addicted to anything, attached to anything in this absorbed way, because you're bound to lose it.

526
00:49:34,361 --> 00:49:37,961
Not out of boredom, but because it's vulnerable.

527
00:49:37,961 --> 00:49:40,601
And then you will go into grief.

528
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:47,080
So the only way to avoid suffering would be to avoid commitment to anything finite and temporal.

529
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,721
That's the Plato-Buddhist way.

530
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:54,761
And the Kierkegaard way is, well, you've got to believe in God and that all things are possible.

531
00:49:54,761 --> 00:50:04,840
And then you will be able to get, change your meaning in this way that we talked about, where you can interiorize the old meaning and get a new one.

532
00:50:04,841 --> 00:50:11,080
But you never can give up the old one, because otherwise you lose yourself and your world.

533
00:50:11,401 --> 00:50:15,801
So the meaning story is what we've been having, and it goes off in one direction.

534
00:50:15,801 --> 00:50:20,841
Now, if what you want is excitement and wonder, you get just the opposite.

535
00:50:20,841 --> 00:50:26,121
Whereas meanings you've got to hold on to, or else your world collapses and you're in grief.

536
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,921
Wonder is something you can't hold on to.

537
00:50:28,921 --> 00:50:37,000
It forces you to speak to go into new worlds because any particular wonder world is going to stop being wonderful.

538
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:48,680
It's sort of like, I just realized, the difference between finding some person that you're involved with as adorable, the way Dante feels about Beatrice.

539
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:52,760
Literally, you adore them, they are the center of your world, they give your life meaning.

540
00:50:52,761 --> 00:50:55,201
Without them, you're going to be lost.

541
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:58,481
And if they are lost, if they leave you, you'd be in grief.

542
00:50:58,481 --> 00:51:00,401
That's finding them adorable.

543
00:51:00,401 --> 00:51:09,281
Finding them wonderful is supposed to be they're not like your God and they're not the center of your world, and you adore them.

544
00:51:09,281 --> 00:51:13,361
Well, I'm sorry, you find them wonderful as long as they are wonderful.

545
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:27,601
And when they start surprising you and filling you with wonder, then they lead you, they leave you, and therefore leave you ready and able, if you're healthy, to get a new world.

546
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:41,441
So that's, I mean, so Nietzsche's really changing the whole picture of what it is to be involved with somebody or something, and changing the whole value of it, and making, and that's really quite an amazing feat.

547
00:51:41,441 --> 00:51:43,761
So let me say more.

548
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:56,881
Now, but Nietzsche doesn't claim to be, I guess, I'm not sure about this, a fully free spirit, because at the end of 237, he, I don't know what's happening here.

549
00:51:56,881 --> 00:52:03,040
So far, I can understand that he thinks that you should get some absorption.

550
00:52:03,441 --> 00:52:09,681
Remember, I can't call it a commitment because commitments, he thinks, are forever, and that's a prison.

551
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,240
But get some, what can I say?

552
00:52:12,241 --> 00:52:13,520
Adoration is wrong too.

553
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,560
That's too religious.

554
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:18,000
Get some, we don't have a good word yet for a wonder object.

555
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,401
That's what you've got to create if you're going to go on being a Nietzschean.

556
00:52:22,401 --> 00:52:24,400
Come and tell me if you've got one.

557
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,401
What?

558
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,801
Connection?

559
00:52:28,801 --> 00:52:29,920
That's too weak.

560
00:52:29,921 --> 00:52:34,881
You've got all sorts of connections, I think, to your bank and to your school and so forth.

561
00:52:34,881 --> 00:52:36,881
Of course, your school could be a wonder object.

562
00:52:37,361 --> 00:52:40,200
But anyway, I'll just call it a wonder object.

563
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:45,241
Well, whatever's wonderful for you and makes your life exciting.

564
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:51,560
So, but he's, I don't, I mean, I think he thinks, this is just a tough one.

565
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,601
I leave it with you.

566
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:58,040
In the brief habits, you establish a habit and then you outgrow it.

567
00:52:58,841 --> 00:53:02,681
What would it be like to be constantly changing your world?

568
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,961
Well, he says that would be awful at the bottom of 237.

569
00:53:05,961 --> 00:53:07,720
Most intolerable, to be sure.

570
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:19,721
And the terrible par excellence would be for me, that Nietzsche, a life entirely devoid of habits, a life that would demand perpetual improvisation, that would be my exile in my Siberia.

571
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:28,841
Yet, I think maybe he thinks that the fully free spirit is going to be perpetually innovating.

572
00:53:28,841 --> 00:53:33,321
I don't even know what that would look like, but I'll tell you where he talks about it.

573
00:53:33,321 --> 00:53:38,280
On 290, and I can't tell how 290 is supposed to, but this is Nietzsche.

574
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:42,121
I mean, sometimes you just can't tell how that's supposed to fit with this.

575
00:53:42,361 --> 00:53:46,601
My way of reading it is that Nietzsche's an almost free spirit.

576
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:53,721
That's why for him, a life of devoid of habits would be just unlivable.

577
00:53:53,720 --> 00:54:02,680
But habits is a sort of bad thing, I think, maybe for Nietzsche, because that keeps you from having ever new eyes and ever new worlds.

578
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:06,040
But anyway, here's what he says on 290.

579
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,160
Is that where I want to be?

580
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:10,601
Yeah, at the very bottom of 289, it starts.

581
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:31,761
He wants to, one could conceive of a pleasure and power of self-determination, such a freedom of the will that the spirit would take leave of all faith and every wish for certainty, being practiced in maintaining itself on insubstantial ropes and possibilities and dancing ever near abysses.

582
00:54:31,761 --> 00:54:35,520
Such a spirit would be the free spirit par excellence.

583
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:45,601
Well, that can't be Nietzsche then, because he just said he couldn't stand it if he were wholly, constantly maintaining himself on insubstantial ropes.

584
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,880
So I think that's all right.

585
00:54:46,881 --> 00:54:49,361
I mean, just as who else did?

586
00:54:49,361 --> 00:54:52,401
Well, Kierkegaard didn't claim to be a Christian.

587
00:54:52,720 --> 00:55:04,241
He wrote his Christian books, two of them, under a pseudonym of somebody really who was able to live in this totally contradictory way that he describes the night of faith.

588
00:55:04,241 --> 00:55:10,000
And I think Nietzsche doesn't consider himself a free spirit, but almost.

589
00:55:10,321 --> 00:55:12,481
Now, where are we here?

590
00:55:13,361 --> 00:55:18,000
So I have lots to say about I still have brief habits, so I sort of go on.

591
00:55:18,321 --> 00:55:22,241
Oh, here's a passage I left out now on page 88.

592
00:55:22,241 --> 00:55:32,080
I mean, this is about how I said Nietzsche understands in the brief habits that you outgrow each brief habit if you're healthy.

593
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:38,240
And here's what he said, and that's just how brief habits are, because brief habits are what's exciting, and things don't stay exciting.

594
00:55:38,241 --> 00:55:42,640
But let's look at the middle of 88, and then I thought Beatrice wants to say something.

595
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:47,441
But the middle of the top paragraph, a little below the middle.

596
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:51,760
Gradually we become tired of the old, of what we safely possess.

597
00:55:51,761 --> 00:55:53,360
We stretch out our hands again.

598
00:55:53,361 --> 00:55:58,961
Even the most beautiful scenery is no longer assorted of our love after we have lived in it for three months.

599
00:55:58,961 --> 00:56:02,240
And some more distant coast attracts our avarice.

600
00:56:02,241 --> 00:56:05,841
Possessions are generally diminished by possession.

601
00:56:05,841 --> 00:56:07,120
And it's true of everything.

602
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:13,160
The music that you find absolutely mind-boggling, if you listen to it enough, it gets to be boring.

603
00:56:13,481 --> 00:56:22,361
And according to him, even a person that you find totally exciting will inevitably get to be boring.

604
00:56:22,361 --> 00:56:28,441
Now, I think I should say he doesn't mean that you couldn't stay with the same person all your life.

605
00:56:28,441 --> 00:56:41,400
It's unlikely, I think he thinks, but possible, that you will just find the same person so exciting and so full of changes, and you and they will change in such a way that it'll always be exciting to be with them.

606
00:56:41,401 --> 00:56:43,000
And that's all right with him.

607
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:51,640
It's just that you've got to be ready to sort of give up what's become boring when it does become boring.

608
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,000
Now, Beatrice first, and then you.

609
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,121
Beatrice, yeah.

610
00:56:54,441 --> 00:56:55,241
Yeah.

611
00:56:56,761 --> 00:56:57,561
Yes.

612
00:56:57,881 --> 00:57:02,761
How do you make sense of your actions when there's no identity tying them together?

613
00:57:02,761 --> 00:57:11,880
What ties them together is something outside of you, which for a while you become attached to.

614
00:57:11,881 --> 00:57:14,441
And we agree probably that that ties you together.

615
00:57:14,441 --> 00:57:17,641
But what ties you together from that to the next to the next?

616
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,000
I think nothing.

617
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,280
I think there is no lasting self, according to Nietzsche.

618
00:57:22,281 --> 00:57:31,641
At the limit, you are the lover of Mary, and then you are the lover of Florence, where I mean the city, now, not the girl, and so forth.

619
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:36,841
And your life is a series of short stories, not a novel.

620
00:57:36,841 --> 00:57:40,841
You don't need a, you can't have, you could have a life as a novel.

621
00:57:40,841 --> 00:57:43,081
That would be a very boring life, according to him.

622
00:57:43,801 --> 00:57:45,080
And there's no you.

623
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,320
There's just a series of short stories, it looks like.

624
00:57:47,321 --> 00:57:48,921
I think he'd be happy with that.

625
00:57:48,921 --> 00:57:50,121
You don't need what?

626
00:57:50,441 --> 00:57:56,800
No, well, your past will seem to you something that I guess I'm just thinking about the phenomenon.

627
00:57:56,801 --> 00:58:03,441
Your past will seem to you something that you once found very exciting, but which you can't find exciting anymore.

628
00:58:03,441 --> 00:58:07,040
Just like I felt about Beethoven's Ninth Symphony at one point.

629
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,281
I don't feel that way about it anymore.

630
00:58:09,441 --> 00:58:15,360
But I know that it blew my mind to play it when I was really wrapped up in it.

631
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,921
That just seems the way it goes.

632
00:58:17,921 --> 00:58:18,400
Okay?

633
00:58:18,401 --> 00:58:18,720
Yeah.

634
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:24,080
To have one habit after the next, you wouldn't, you know, be broadened.

635
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,121
Well, that's the, I see the question.

636
00:58:27,441 --> 00:58:29,441
Yeah, can you be aware?

637
00:58:29,441 --> 00:58:34,881
And the answer is in the brief habit passage, he's very interesting on that subject.

638
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,161
Because that's the sort of where he's a fool.

639
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:42,000
Remember where it says, now I've lost it.

640
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,240
Tell me where the tell me where the brief habits are.

641
00:58:44,241 --> 00:58:44,640
What?

642
00:58:45,921 --> 00:58:48,640
You believe because you have this fool in you.

643
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,241
I've got to find my quote again.

644
00:58:50,241 --> 00:58:51,520
Where is my brief habits?

645
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,881
236.

646
00:58:52,881 --> 00:58:56,321
You're asking exactly the right question about this.

647
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:09,841
There's something, and even something new is waiting at the door, along with my faith, this indestructible fool and sage, that this new discovery will be just right, that it will last, this will be the last time.

648
00:59:09,841 --> 00:59:17,520
So you're both in it and think this is the last time and realize that it won't be the last time.

649
00:59:18,241 --> 00:59:20,400
It's something like infatuation.

650
00:59:20,961 --> 00:59:28,560
Because you've got to really think this is it, and know that you've thought this is it lots of times, so why should this be it?

651
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,681
And yet you think, well, all those times we're wrong, but this is it.

652
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:34,800
And a funny frame of mind is what he's talking about.

653
00:59:34,801 --> 00:59:35,200
Yeah.

654
00:59:41,401 --> 00:59:44,760
How do you prevent something from becoming part of the herd?

655
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:54,520
Well, you become part of the herd, I think, only if you're weak.

656
00:59:54,520 --> 01:00:05,961
And if you're weak, you grab hold of what one does and do what everybody does as you're giving you your identity, and you won't be able to be a free spirit.

657
01:00:05,961 --> 01:00:16,361
But once you are a free spirit, you won't be able to find any wonder and fun and excitement in doing what normal people normally do.

658
01:00:16,361 --> 01:00:18,040
Is that mind I answering you?

659
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,280
Oh, maybe he's going to say something on it.

660
01:00:22,441 --> 01:00:28,520
So the herd tendency, which isn't that all human nature, the desire.

661
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,040
Yes, I think it is.

662
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:35,561
It's, well, no, no, it's not human nature.

663
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:39,881
It's that every culture tries to train people into that.

664
01:00:39,881 --> 01:00:43,881
And that's because it works better as a culture that way.

665
01:00:43,881 --> 01:00:51,560
But it's not human nature, and the free thinkers can break out of it and do break out of it, and then they look crazy or evil.

666
01:00:51,881 --> 01:00:52,440
Okay.

667
01:00:53,481 --> 01:00:53,800
Yeah.

668
01:00:59,801 --> 01:01:03,720
Ooh, I have no idea, but I don't want to talk about it because it's not in our reading.

669
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:07,320
And it's a whole can of worms all of its own.

670
01:01:07,401 --> 01:01:12,120
There's a dozen interpretations of it, and each one would have its own way of fitting it in.

671
01:01:13,881 --> 01:01:16,761
I take the whatever amendments and not talk about it.

672
01:01:16,761 --> 01:01:17,320
Okay.

673
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:21,160
Now, now so where are we?

674
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:21,880
Let's see.

675
01:01:21,881 --> 01:01:25,761
I want to see if I've covered everything about brief habits.

676
01:01:23,321 --> 01:01:28,401
But then we can go on to the next thing.

677
01:01:28,961 --> 01:01:32,481
The brief habits are in the wonder business.

678
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:35,840
I wonder if I really read the right quote for that, or a quote.

679
01:01:35,841 --> 01:01:38,000
I've been telling you about wonder.

680
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:46,241
Okay, so here, something called the Great Health on page 346 is about this.

681
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,121
Yeah, I guess we can read it here.

682
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,161
The bottom paragraph.

683
01:01:54,160 --> 01:02:02,161
This is what it feels like to be in the, I'm sort of transitioning from, now, well, yeah, let me get this straight.

684
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:13,201
I'm going from brief habits, which is the lowest level of this kind of wonder life, to the highest level of this kind of wonder life.

685
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,641
Because the brief habits isn't really opening up new worlds.

686
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:22,561
It's sort of falling in love with Mary and then falling in love with Rome or Paris or whatever.

687
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:27,281
But now I'm skipping to what it is to be really healthy.

688
01:02:27,281 --> 01:02:29,841
And now I'm going to read the bottom of 346.

689
01:02:29,841 --> 01:02:32,161
It's the same thing on a grand scale.

690
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:44,561
And now, after we've long been on our way, we agonauts and argonauts of the ideal, with more daring than perhaps prudent, and skipping a little, dangerously healthy and ever healthy again.

691
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:55,601
It will seem to us as if, as a reward, we are now confronted with a yet undiscovered country whose boundaries nobody has surveyed yet, something beyond all the lands and nooks of the ideal so far.

692
01:02:55,600 --> 01:03:02,481
A world so overrich in what is beautiful, strange, questionable, terrible, and divine.

693
01:03:02,481 --> 01:03:05,121
Notice, in there, everything is there but meaning.

694
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,961
That's the wonder world.

695
01:03:06,961 --> 01:03:13,720
Beautiful, strange, questionable, terrible, and divine, that our curiosity as well as our craving to possess it has got beside itself.

696
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,921
Alas, now nothing will save us anymore.

697
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:23,721
That's the way to live if you're a free spirit.

698
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,000
Now, let me see.

699
01:03:25,321 --> 01:03:26,760
Oh, I was going to tell the story.

700
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:29,320
I get to it here in my notes, but I want to make sure I get there.

701
01:03:29,881 --> 01:03:33,481
Try to think of it in terms of artists, if you want another example.

702
01:03:33,481 --> 01:03:45,481
Like, I'm trying to give this thing of how it is to be in it and not be able to see how you could be in anything else, and yet to know that when you were, that you have been in other things, and you will be out of this eventually.

703
01:03:45,481 --> 01:03:48,280
Another thing is, moods have that quality, it occurs to me.

704
01:03:48,281 --> 01:03:49,720
That wasn't what I was going to talk about.

705
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:56,121
When you're in a mood, it seems like you always going to be in that mood, and it's what else could you be in?

706
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,280
And yet you know you were not always in.

707
01:03:58,281 --> 01:04:02,441
But a better example, probably, is artists, and I take Picasso.

708
01:04:02,441 --> 01:04:05,080
So, Picasso is in a certain period.

709
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,520
He's painting everything blue.

710
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:07,800
He's in the blue period.

711
01:04:07,801 --> 01:04:11,000
That's the style of his life right then.

712
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:18,520
Now, he knows, I presume, that he's been in other styles and that eventually blue will get boring.

713
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:25,321
But while it isn't boring, sort of blue is just exciting and fascinating, and everything looks like it should be painted in blue.

714
01:04:25,321 --> 01:04:35,481
And he's sort of inside it and can't picture what it would be like to be outside it, to see anything that wasn't sort of asking to be painted in blue.

715
01:04:35,481 --> 01:04:39,000
But so he's both sort of living in it.

716
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:55,761
Just another example that I was giving, like the infatuation one, living in it, knowing that this experience has happened before and it will end, but not having any sense of how it could have been exciting before it came around and how it could be exciting after it came around.

717
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:02,481
It just seems to be the only exciting game in town when you're in it.

718
01:05:02,961 --> 01:05:07,681
That sounds like the right description, and that's certainly how Nietzsche pictures it.

719
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:14,081
So you throw yourself into a style until you exhaust the possibilities of that style.

720
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:16,561
And then you're bored with that style.

721
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:19,680
And you throw yourself a new cubism, it's right around the corner.

722
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:24,320
And as soon as Picasso stops painting blue, he starts painting cubes.

723
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,881
But he couldn't see that in advance.

724
01:05:27,281 --> 01:05:32,241
They know they'll outgrow their style, presumably, but they can't picture how that could be.

725
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:40,080
Okay, now, I think I got that done as well as I can do it, but let me look here.

726
01:05:40,401 --> 01:05:42,881
Yeah, I don't think I need that one.

727
01:05:42,881 --> 01:05:52,401
So, and okay, now I'm going to just get back again what was going on in the polytheism talk and a talk about animals.

728
01:05:52,401 --> 01:06:10,000
But to nail it down, the highest level of being a God yourself, a new man, a free spirit, is to be constantly opening new worlds, doing the one thing that animals can't do.

729
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:16,000
And I just want to read you those passages because they are so essential to Nietzsche's.

730
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Remember, I said at the beginning, Nietzsche has to transvaluate values and give you a whole new understanding of what human beings are good for, and of the feeling that you got when you got this, what human beings are good for, and how exciting it is to be doing what human beings should be doing.

731
01:06:34,001 --> 01:06:42,840
He's going to substitute for meaning and commitment and bliss and this whole other wonder story.

732
01:06:43,161 --> 01:06:53,080
And that's, and the dreamless wonder story is just the story that they're constantly creation, we can constantly create new worlds.

733
01:06:53,081 --> 01:06:56,441
So you get, and that's got to do with the new value.

734
01:06:56,441 --> 01:06:59,160
Now we can look at the bottom of 265 again.

735
01:07:00,441 --> 01:07:04,040
He's talking about the creation of new tables of what is good.

736
01:07:04,041 --> 01:07:11,800
And then he gives you this rhapsodic, excited version of it about 10 lines down on 266.

737
01:07:12,121 --> 01:07:15,160
We, however, want to become those we are.

738
01:07:15,161 --> 01:07:18,520
That is what human beings are at their best.

739
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:26,281
Human beings who are new, unique, incomparable, who give themselves laws, who create themselves.

740
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:31,000
That's the picture, the new picture.

741
01:07:31,001 --> 01:07:33,401
And so you hear him, and keep your eye open as you read it.

742
01:07:33,401 --> 01:07:36,281
I tried to keep track of them, but I haven't really succeeded.

743
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:43,321
He talks about creating new suns, new worlds, new gods, new eyes.

744
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:46,680
That many I found, but I bet there are more too.

745
01:07:46,680 --> 01:08:03,321
And that means finally, that's the whole story about transvaluating all values: is to see the ultimate value as the constantly creating new whatever's.

746
01:08:03,321 --> 01:08:06,200
That's what human beings are good at.

747
01:08:06,201 --> 01:08:07,800
That's what's exciting.

748
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,680
That's what's self-rewarding.

749
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,840
That's what it is to be alive.

750
01:08:13,161 --> 01:08:15,481
I've got time for questions.

751
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:19,560
If not, I'll go on for another five minutes.

752
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:25,520
But I think I've said one big chunk of things, so somebody might have something to say about it.

753
01:08:26,481 --> 01:08:27,680
Please stop.

754
01:08:23,321 --> 01:08:30,401
I think that this is such a, well, okay, good.

755
01:08:31,041 --> 01:08:32,880
If you believe in.

756
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:33,361
Yeah.

757
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:35,120
Yeah?

758
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:38,960
Well, I see, because you don't see how radical it is.

759
01:08:39,361 --> 01:08:44,000
The question is, why couldn't you be a free spirit and believe in Christianity?

760
01:08:44,001 --> 01:08:47,600
Well, you wouldn't be inventing new gods, for sure.

761
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:54,560
Well, worlds, new worlds, and new gods and new values all go together for Nietzsche.

762
01:08:54,560 --> 01:09:05,201
I mean, you can't, if there are any, if there's a human nature, then you haven't really invented new, new, you haven't really become the kind of person who can totally reinvent themselves.

763
01:09:05,201 --> 01:09:13,441
It seems to me within a religion, you've got to have the eyes that see what people in that religion see.

764
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:17,441
You've got to do what any good person and so forth.

765
01:09:18,081 --> 01:09:30,720
It just goes against the idea that, and another way to put it is, you're not going to find sort of, say, Christianity exciting until it gets boring and then give it up.

766
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:33,680
And then you have Buddhism for a while until that gets boring.

767
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,600
That's not how religions are.

768
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,321
When you got them, you want to hold on to them.

769
01:09:38,321 --> 01:09:44,960
Ooh, I missed a passage somewhere where he said, why that there's no grief?

770
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:46,880
Explicitly.

771
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:50,960
I mean, see, there won't be any, there would be grief if you lost your religion.

772
01:09:51,201 --> 01:09:55,040
You'd be lost in one, you wouldn't have any meaning in any orientation.

773
01:09:55,041 --> 01:09:55,960
Oh, I don't know if I can.

774
01:09:56,041 --> 01:09:56,640
Give me a minute.

775
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,880
I don't know whether I can find the new grief.

776
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,800
Yeah, I got it.

777
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,280
There's no grief, 231.

778
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,920
I don't know how I skipped it.

779
01:10:06,161 --> 01:10:11,560
But so that's another way to understand how the wonder world is different.

780
01:10:08,241 --> 01:10:15,000
So at the bottom of 231, and I'll stop with this.

781
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:17,080
This is number 289.

782
01:10:17,241 --> 01:10:23,720
Consider how every individual is affected by overall philosophical justification of his way of life.

783
01:10:25,161 --> 01:10:26,441
I don't know where this is going to get us.

784
01:10:26,441 --> 01:10:30,600
He experiences it as a sun that shines essentially for him and bestows warmth.

785
01:10:31,081 --> 01:10:37,880
So having a certain philosophical view is just one more of these sort of grief habits you could have.

786
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:43,161
He experiences it as a sun that shines for him and bestows warmth, blessing, fertility on him.

787
01:10:43,161 --> 01:10:48,680
It makes him independent of praise and blame, self-sufficient, rich in happiness and goodwill.

788
01:10:48,680 --> 01:11:00,441
Incessantly, it refashions evil into good, leaves all energies to bloom and ripen, and doesn't permit the petty weeds of grief and chagrin and embarrassment, let's say, to come up again.

789
01:11:00,441 --> 01:11:06,040
In the end, one exclaims, how I wish that many such new suns were yet to be created.

790
01:11:06,041 --> 01:11:07,720
Isn't that interesting?

791
01:11:08,121 --> 01:11:11,401
That's the same brief habit story written very large.

792
01:11:11,401 --> 01:11:22,760
So you can have a whole philosophical view, and it will give you all sorts of happiness, and you can just find it wonderful to live in it, and you'll part with it without grief.

793
01:11:23,081 --> 01:11:25,160
Your world won't fall apart.

794
01:11:25,161 --> 01:11:33,321
You will just want a new one, a new philosophy, a new sun that will be created by you, presumably.

795
01:11:33,321 --> 01:11:55,441
He's not emphasizing that, but it's just as he thinks that the polytheistic gods, let me say a word about that, are created by the people who create them, who have them as gods, so he seems to think that these philosophy views can be created by you, and then you can learn to abandon them.

796
01:11:55,441 --> 01:11:57,760
Let me read more of this to myself.

797
01:11:53,241 --> 01:11:59,600
Well, it's all about, okay, let's try this.

798
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,960
We must learn to abandon the arrogant fancy.

799
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:10,720
The arrogant fancy would be that there was one philosophy that was right, one sign, that S-O-S-U-N.

800
01:12:12,481 --> 01:12:24,160
So we shouldn't, what these people need, people who believe that there's only just one right philosophy, is something, a new, they need new philosophers.

801
01:12:24,161 --> 01:12:29,520
And then it's, he says, there is yet another world to be discovered and more than one.

802
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,680
Embark philosophers ends.

803
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:36,000
That is, just that's a guess, just again, you see what I mean?

804
01:12:36,001 --> 01:12:49,760
You can have a philosophy, you can live and see things in terms of it, you can find it exciting and gratifying and comforting and warming and so forth, but you shouldn't get stuck with it, because then you would experience grief.

805
01:12:49,760 --> 01:13:05,280
But if you see it as something that's working right then for you, but you will give it up when the time comes and take a new one, that's what philosophers should do, because there's always, again, new worlds to be discovered.

806
01:13:05,281 --> 01:13:09,361
Now I think I've covered all that, so we should stop.

807
01:13:09,361 --> 01:13:09,600
Okay.
