00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:06,560
So we ended up last time doing the Greek philosophical rationale, rational, theoretical understanding of everything, and how if you became a detached person and had a theory about the world, it could be objectively true, and then you would understand the laws that govern nature, the ethical principles that are valid for everybody and for all times, and you would, in a way, become eternal because you could merge with these eternal, the most important part of you, namely your theoretical, detached part of you, could merge with this abstract reality, and then you'd be free of all the messiness of what philosophers call finitude, which amounts to change, perspective, conflict, death, and you would become, the best part of you would become eternal.

2
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,520
We did all that.

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:20,161
And then I ask you what the other half of our tradition is, because in our peculiar tradition, we've got this whole amazing theory story about how to think about things.

4
00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:27,841
But then it turns out, and some of you were shouting it, I think, but I couldn't hear who was saying what.

5
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:42,560
But out of the noise of what people were saying, it emerged that the other one is the Hebrew, or sometimes called the Judeo-Christian tradition, and that's not about abstract objective thinking.

6
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,440
That's about a certain kind of committed acting.

7
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,161
So, and we're going to get to that now.

8
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:54,041
So, I'll just summarize again once more.

9
00:01:54,041 --> 00:02:01,721
So, from the Greeks, we've got this notion of our being a detached self.

10
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:11,960
We can be critical, we can be reflective, we can be rational, we can be objective, but that doesn't determine at all who you are.

11
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:14,680
In fact, it sort of wipes you out.

12
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:25,560
So, that because in ethics you do what everybody does, the rational thing, you contemplate these rational patterns, you merge with the rational patterns of the universe, and there isn't any you.

13
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,161
There's something there, any individual you.

14
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:32,041
There is this thinking you.

15
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:41,161
But then there is the Judeo-Christian tradition, and now we have to talk about that in the same categories that we talked about the Greeks.

16
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:48,760
And the existentialists are on the side of the Judeo-Christian tradition.

17
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,000
They're critical of this whole Greek view.

18
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,800
They might even be distorting it, but I don't think so.

19
00:02:56,281 --> 00:03:14,121
I'm enough of an existentialist to think that that's a, what I just told you was an accurate description of the amazing power that we to think and be objective that we've invented that the Greeks invented and we've inherited.

20
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,120
But there is this other tradition now.

21
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:22,361
They don't divide things up into the epistemological and morality and metaphysics.

22
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:34,961
They're too busy acting, running around, doing things in history to have this kind of philosophical study.

23
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,240
But you can sort of ask yourself anyway, what are the Hebrews saying about truth?

24
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,881
That's the epistemology one first.

25
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:46,321
Well, it's a very different notion of truth.

26
00:03:46,321 --> 00:03:54,961
Truth is not this objective getting true beliefs that correspond to the way the world is.

27
00:03:54,961 --> 00:04:02,961
Truth is being true to somebody, and particularly in this religious aspect, being true to God.

28
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,361
But we have this expression still.

29
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:06,961
Are you being true to him?

30
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:08,240
Are you being true to her?

31
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:10,240
Are you being true to yourself?

32
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:21,121
And we still have, for those who are in this tradition, particularly here the Hebrews, that there is a sense of being true to God.

33
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:37,201
That is, God asks that the Hebrews have a total commitment to him, and he makes a covenant with them that he will watch over them if they obey and are devoted to him.

34
00:04:37,201 --> 00:04:39,601
And that's a kind of truth.

35
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,240
It's not a detached contemplation kind of truth.

36
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,761
It's a, well, just wondering, is this turned on?

37
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,120
David, did we turn it on?

38
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,761
Okay.

39
00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:58,240
Instead of a detached contemplation kind of truth, it's a total commitment kind of truth.

40
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,521
To be true to God is to keep the covenant.

41
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,881
And that's the highest form of truth there is.

42
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,601
That means you can see all sorts of differences.

43
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:16,681
For Greeks, the truth is open to all the people because every human being has a universal, rational, theoretical capacity.

44
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:27,561
And if you teach them, any people, Greek, then they can also, say, do geometry.

45
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:38,841
There's a dialogue, the Mino, where Socrates teaches a slave boy who doesn't have any philosophical education step by step to prove the Pythagorean theorem.

46
00:05:38,841 --> 00:05:45,801
That's a very different way of looking at the people who are not automatically in your group.

47
00:05:46,760 --> 00:06:07,401
For the Hebrews, since truth is revealed by God and has this request, this demand to be true to him, it's revealed at a certain time and a certain place, and then it's written down in the Torah and preserved in the tradition.

48
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,001
So truth is not universal and timeless, like it is for the Greeks.

49
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,641
It's local and historical for this particular people at this particular time who got this particular message.

50
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:24,121
So how do you deal with outsiders?

51
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:34,681
Well, like in the Mino, you can teach them Greek and teach them math and integrate them into this theoretical world of thinking.

52
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,560
But when the Hebrews deal with outsiders, they don't try to, particularly the early ones.

53
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:53,721
I mean, the Hebrew, don't write me email as I get from the podcast people and people in office hours telling me that after all, the Judaism and the Ten Commandments is for everybody and so forth.

54
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:55,721
Eventually, it got that way.

55
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:57,560
But I'm talking about at the beginning.

56
00:06:57,561 --> 00:06:59,681
At the beginning, it wasn't for everybody.

57
00:06:59,681 --> 00:07:03,841
There were the Hebrews with their covenant, and everybody else was idol worshippers.

58
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:09,441
And with idol worshippers, you just ignore them, or if they get in the way, you kill them.

59
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:12,321
But what you don't do is convert them.

60
00:07:13,201 --> 00:07:17,281
That would be that because the covenant wasn't made with them.

61
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,121
By the way, stop me if you think that you disagree or that you don't understand.

62
00:07:23,441 --> 00:07:25,681
And so the ultimate authority.

63
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,881
Wait a minute, I want to make.

64
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,160
Yeah, now we're in morality.

65
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,081
I've just finished truth.

66
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:32,801
And now, the next one is morality.

67
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:37,921
There, the ultimate authority is God, not reason.

68
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,400
And you can see it if you look at the Euthyphro.

69
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,761
I didn't mention the Euthyphro already.

70
00:07:43,841 --> 00:07:45,841
Are I repeating myself at all?

71
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:48,401
Why did I mention the Euthyphro already?

72
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,761
Maybe I didn't.

73
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,201
And did I?

74
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,041
Yeah, why did I?

75
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:53,760
I don't know.

76
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,681
Anyway, I'm going to mention the Euthyphro again.

77
00:07:55,681 --> 00:07:57,121
I don't think I said this.

78
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:04,961
That in the Euthyphro, Socrates is trying to tell Euthyphro what the right thing to do is, or help Euthyphro figure it out.

79
00:08:04,961 --> 00:08:14,881
Because Euthyphro, I think I did say this, has to decide whether to turn in his father, who's killed a slave, or left him to die in a ditch, really, or not.

80
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:22,240
But Socrates is trying to find common ground so that he can reason with Euthyphro about what he ought to do.

81
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,240
And that turns out to be hard.

82
00:08:24,801 --> 00:08:34,721
But he does find it by asking Euthyphro: is an action good because the gods love it, or do the gods love it because it's good?

83
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:44,921
The actual phrase, if you go look it up, is he says, is it good because the gods, because it's pious, or is it pious because the gods approve?

84
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,281
But I just put it, keep it in my way, because that's a more normal way to put it.

85
00:08:50,280 --> 00:09:08,040
So the question is: if you're going to do something, and in this case, turn in your father or not, the question is, is the right thing to do what the gods approve of, or is there some independent way of finding out what is the right thing to do?

86
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,281
And then everybody who's rational, including the gods, will approve of it.

87
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,721
What do you think?

88
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:21,560
Is an action pious because the gods love it and approve of it?

89
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:26,601
Or do the gods love it and approve of it because it's pious, because it's good?

90
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,601
Now we're asking for not your opinion, but Euthypro's opinion.

91
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:32,361
If you agree, what do you say?

92
00:09:32,361 --> 00:09:33,401
You?

93
00:09:34,601 --> 00:09:40,280
Yeah, she says in Greco-Roman mythology, the gods were largely immoral.

94
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:49,481
And that's true, but what we're hearing is Socrates doesn't like mythology and he doesn't like the gods, and he's trying to, in fact, that's what he gets in trouble for.

95
00:09:49,481 --> 00:09:59,401
You know, Socrates finally gets tried by the Athenians for inventing new gods, which the new god, I think, is rationality.

96
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:05,481
And he thinks that mythology is exactly, in tradition, is exactly not right.

97
00:10:05,801 --> 00:10:12,601
So, and insofar as these gods behave in this immoral way, you just have to not count them.

98
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:14,841
So, go ahead.

99
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,880
Terrific.

100
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,041
Well put and exactly right.

101
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,760
I mean if there's some rational right thing to do, which we they hadn't figured out yet with Euthyphro, but there is something right to do.

102
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,881
You either have to turn in your father or not.

103
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:34,481
And it's going to be a complicated case because it's there are duties on both sides and so forth.

104
00:10:34,561 --> 00:10:44,321
But whatever the right rational ethical answer is, Euthyphro has to obey it, or else he's doing bad things.

105
00:10:44,321 --> 00:10:47,441
And the gods obey it, because it's the right thing to do.

106
00:10:47,441 --> 00:10:54,321
Now the interesting thing and getting ready for reading Kierkegaard is to ask the Hebrew story.

107
00:10:54,321 --> 00:11:04,161
Do the gods, is an action good because the gods approve it, command it, require it, or is it required because it's good?

108
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,280
And yeah.

109
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,361
Yeah, right.

110
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,240
And but and moreover, he's absolutely right.

111
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,161
What is good is what God declares to be good.

112
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:34,000
And he declares it not in general, which would make it more back to the Greeks, but for each person in each situation, it's whatever God requires of them that is the right thing to do.

113
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:38,640
Now, if you're going to push that to an extreme, what would you say?

114
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:52,960
Let's find a case in which it is really clear that something is good if God requires it, no matter what you might normally and rationally think about it.

115
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,680
It doesn't matter.

116
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,281
It's what God demands.

117
00:11:55,761 --> 00:11:59,120
What would be the extremist case in the Bible of that?

118
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,640
Yes, Abraham sacrificing Isaac on the front of your book.

119
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,601
Exactly.

120
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:06,561
There it is.

121
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:13,361
God says, kill your son, and it becomes the right thing for Abraham to do.

122
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:20,680
And he will show his faith and be admired as the father of the faith if he does succeed in killing his son.

123
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,081
Now, Kierkegaard's got lots of worries about that.

124
00:12:23,081 --> 00:12:27,160
How's that going to look to Sarah and to the rest of everybody else?

125
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,321
And we'll have to talk about that.

126
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:34,520
Those are what's called the problems, where Kierkegaard goes through problem one and two and so forth.

127
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:54,601
But the answer, the problems arise because they all agree that if God commands it, it's the right thing to do, no matter what it seems to normal, rational people just watching what's going on.

128
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,160
And what God commands is different for every person.

129
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:11,240
Everybody has their own calling, everybody has their own situation, and everyone is trying to do what God requires of them in that.

130
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,400
And that means God's command to kill Abraham.

131
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,601
That's sort of what you weren't quite clear about.

132
00:13:18,601 --> 00:13:23,321
It isn't God says, God said the requirement to kill Abraham, to kill Isaac.

133
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:28,601
It isn't something like a statement about what's good in general is up to God.

134
00:13:28,761 --> 00:13:33,561
It's that what counts as good in each particular situation is up to God.

135
00:13:33,561 --> 00:13:42,200
It doesn't, when God tells Abraham to kill Isaac, he doesn't mean that if you're a good, pious father, you should kill your son.

136
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,841
That all good fathers should kill their sons.

137
00:13:44,841 --> 00:13:51,400
It just says, Abraham, the thing your duty is to do is to kill your son.

138
00:13:51,400 --> 00:14:01,440
Okay, that's a pretty strange form of ethics, and it causes lots of problems, which Kierkegaard is happy to take on in the book.

139
00:14:01,761 --> 00:14:13,760
And finally, okay, now metaphysics, we're not going to get into that nearly so much as the truth issues and the what's right and wrong issues, but it's important to see the contrast.

140
00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:26,480
Remember, for the Greeks, the thing you want to do is contemplate the eternal, like in mathematics or even the laws of science, that don't change with time.

141
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:36,960
Change is upsetting, and you can't have a theory if you're going to have, if the universe is going to change its rules or if you keep changing the rules.

142
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:42,400
So time is something, is a bother to be gotten out of.

143
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,640
Well, not for the Hebrews.

144
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,240
Time is where everything important happens.

145
00:14:48,561 --> 00:14:50,960
And for the Greeks, nothing important happens.

146
00:14:50,960 --> 00:15:01,280
Remember the universe, I said, just recycles, and people just make it explicit in their lives the sort of character that they have from the moment they're born.

147
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:06,081
There is no change of any importance.

148
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:09,361
And consider all the important things that happen in time.

149
00:15:09,361 --> 00:15:11,601
Well, first, it gets created.

150
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:16,720
It's hard to know what it is to say that at a certain moment, time starts.

151
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,081
But that's the view.

152
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:26,000
It started 5,784 years ago, to be a thing, according to the Hebrew calendar that is still counting.

153
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,841
And that's when it all got created.

154
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:34,000
Even if the dates are wrong, they don't believe in constant recycling.

155
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:37,841
They believe that there was a moment in which the universe was created.

156
00:15:37,841 --> 00:15:46,440
As I said, I'm pretty sure last time, they would believe the Big Bang story, not the Big Crunch story, which the Greeks would believe.

157
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,640
And, okay, first for that.

158
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,720
And then there are other crucial moments.

159
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,680
There's the covenant with God, which we talked about.

160
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,321
Abraham gets this special relation.

161
00:15:57,321 --> 00:16:03,960
There's Moses, who at another time, particular date, in a particular place, gets the Ten Commandments.

162
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,440
Then the most important thing happens.

163
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,800
What it is exactly is a complicated story which we aren't going to go into very much.

164
00:16:11,801 --> 00:16:17,561
But God becomes man and shows up at a particular place in history.

165
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,120
The jargon for that is that's the incarnation.

166
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:32,680
That's Jesus, who is God and who shows up as a particular person in a particular place, which is a scandal from the point of view of the Greeks.

167
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:48,120
The ultimate truth, the ultimate goodness, the ultimate everything is a particular being, a human being, who is also God and is in time.

168
00:16:50,281 --> 00:17:01,640
So that if God is eternal, well, for the Greeks, and in a certain way for the Hebrews, then the eternal shows up at a particular moment for the Hebrews.

169
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,000
That's what is the scandal for the Greeks.

170
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:08,601
And how does it work in terms of individual people?

171
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:15,880
Well, people can only, remember, develop their character, make explicit what's implicit.

172
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:25,240
There was this thing called the human potential movement once upon a time in the 70s, which was trying to sort of bring out what's best in people.

173
00:17:25,241 --> 00:17:34,480
And you can't do anything more than bring out what's best in people because there's no such thing as radical creation on that view.

174
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:43,520
But the Hebrew view has not only is the universe created, but people are subject to radical transformation.

175
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:46,800
You know it under the description being reborn.

176
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:49,280
Being reborn is very different.

177
00:17:50,241 --> 00:17:58,561
A Christian concept of being reborn is not at all like bringing out your human potential, making explicit what's best in you.

178
00:17:58,561 --> 00:18:01,760
Kierkegaard says there's nothing good in you.

179
00:18:01,761 --> 00:18:06,480
That's what original sin is supposed to say and explain.

180
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:13,361
You've got to be transformed into some, into another, into what Kierkegaard calls in our reading, a new being.

181
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:24,640
You become, if you were reborn, you become a new being, and that's radical transformation, not growth or realization or development.

182
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:29,680
One more point, and that is also worlds are radically changed.

183
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:37,520
I mean, it isn't as if you just go from the Greek world to the Homeric world to the Athenian Greek world to the Roman.

184
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,041
I mean, those are all, from the Greek point of view, continuous.

185
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:46,640
I mean, they went on reading and reciting Homer, so to speak, through it all.

186
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:54,160
But the way it looks to the Judeo-Christian is that a radically new world was created when God became man.

187
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,160
So radically new that we got BC and AD.

188
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,720
There's before Christ and after God.

189
00:19:00,721 --> 00:19:03,601
That's what those letters are short for.

190
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:09,920
And that means there was a time before the world was changed, and that was the pagan world.

191
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,880
And then there was the time that God came into the world.

192
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,160
And then that was the Judeo-Christian world.

193
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,240
And that is a radical transformation.

194
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:28,920
It wasn't as if the saints were implicit, Jesus was implicit in the Roman world all along and it became explicit.

195
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:33,000
It's just nothing like that was there, and then there it was.

196
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:34,760
Okay, now.

197
00:19:34,761 --> 00:19:38,920
Then let's have a stop to see if anybody wants to say anything.

198
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:45,480
And then when I'll have to start drawing out the consequences of the fact that there are these two radically different traditions.

199
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:53,960
And by the way, help me remember to give out, I've written down what I'm just saying, but I just don't want to interrupt you.

200
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:07,640
The summing up, I want to hand the handout, which everything on one side is the Hebrew story, and on the other side is the Judeo-Christian story, so you'll be able to hold on to it because that's sort of the backbone of the course.

201
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:07,880
Yeah.

202
00:20:20,601 --> 00:20:31,001
Where in there is the Roman individuality of the self and kind of understand or gather talking or something you can realize and be born again and follow the panel?

203
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,921
Where is there?

204
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:35,001
Okay, well, that's a terrific question.

205
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:39,160
That is, you're the perfect straight person for this because that's what I want to talk about next.

206
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:52,520
But in broader than in the self, I'm not even sure I'm going to get to the self, but the big issue I want to talk about next, and it'll have implications, maybe even for a paper, on how you would try to work it out.

207
00:20:52,521 --> 00:21:01,841
But the issue is how to get these two traditions, which seem so opposed to each other, together in some way.

208
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:10,721
And that is, I'm going to just run through them in a hurry, just to remind you, and then we're going to talk about how to do it.

209
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,200
I may not even want to run through it because I just did.

210
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,960
I think I don't need to say this.

211
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,721
Well, let's sum them up.

212
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,880
The Greek view of truth is: truth is objectivity.

213
00:21:23,521 --> 00:21:30,321
The Greek viewing morality is don't make an exception of yourself.

214
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:34,160
And you could sum that up as the universal is higher than the individual.

215
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:40,160
So you should do what everyone would do, every good person would do in that situation.

216
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:47,680
And the story and ultimate reality is to reach eternity, you have to get out of time, and that's a good thing to do.

217
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:54,400
And the opposite view, to sum it up, is truth is being true to something specific and local.

218
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,321
It's involved personal commitment.

219
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,960
And the ethical is you do what God requires of you as an individual.

220
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,680
That's the only good thing you can do.

221
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:14,160
And time is where everything meaningful happens, and particularly new things happen, totally new things.

222
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:22,800
And even God must show up in time, which means something I can't explain to you yet, but it will become important in the course.

223
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:25,680
Eternity is only possible in time.

224
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,601
A very, very weird view.

225
00:22:27,841 --> 00:22:31,681
But Kierkegaard holds that view, and so does Dostoevsky.

226
00:22:33,281 --> 00:22:35,601
So now, what happens?

227
00:22:35,601 --> 00:22:45,321
Well, you want to be thoughtful as a good human being and having the capacity to think and be rational, have theories, and you want to involve, be active.

228
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,400
You need to think and you need committed action.

229
00:22:49,720 --> 00:23:00,440
And the question really is, for anybody in this culture, how to get them together, or which one to cancel, or which one trumps which one.

230
00:23:01,081 --> 00:23:05,481
And this is a unique question, kind of question for our culture, I think.

231
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,440
And if people want to disagree about this, I'd be happy to hear other examples.

232
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:22,280
I mean, we've got two totally, totally worked-out views of what it is to be a human being, what reality is, what people are like, and the self and what they should be doing.

233
00:23:22,281 --> 00:23:24,201
And they don't seem to fit together.

234
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,000
They seem to be totally opposed to each other.

235
00:23:27,001 --> 00:23:31,400
We are a completely conflicted culture.

236
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,680
It's just amazing.

237
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,521
Amazing, too, that people don't talk about it more and worry about it more.

238
00:23:36,761 --> 00:23:37,321
They do.

239
00:23:37,321 --> 00:23:39,241
They just don't notice that that's what they're doing.

240
00:23:39,241 --> 00:23:41,720
I'll try to say that in a minute.

241
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:47,480
But I think I want to say, just as contrast, there are other cultures, I think, in which there are two traditions.

242
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:56,200
I think in China, as I understand it, so Buddhism and Confucianism and Taoism, there are, in fact, three traditions all existing side by side.

243
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,401
And they don't contradict each other.

244
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,841
They complement each other or they ignore each other.

245
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,081
Or they, in Japan, well, it's really amazing.

246
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:18,841
I spent a month in Japan, and one of the things I learned was that there are more people signed up for various organized religions, than there are people in Japan.

247
00:24:18,841 --> 00:24:22,680
And that's because they sign up for several religions.

248
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:32,640
And the most popular thing I heard, people told me when I was there, is that at birth it's a good thing when somebody's born to have a Hindu ceremony.

249
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:39,280
And there's something really great about getting married, particularly good if you have a Christian wedding.

250
00:24:39,281 --> 00:24:44,000
And as you die, it's a good thing to die as a Buddhist.

251
00:24:44,001 --> 00:24:46,241
And that doesn't bother them.

252
00:24:46,241 --> 00:24:47,281
In fact, it's wonderful.

253
00:24:47,841 --> 00:24:50,240
And they have a thousand other gods besides.

254
00:24:50,241 --> 00:24:53,200
And it's a really polytheistic culture.

255
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,801
But that's not ours.

256
00:24:54,801 --> 00:24:59,281
We've got the kind of monotheistic, two monotheistic views.

257
00:24:59,281 --> 00:25:07,040
One, everything built around theory and rationality, and one, everything built around commitment and action.

258
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:09,040
And what do you do about that?

259
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:11,120
Well, first, I'm just going to sum up.

260
00:25:11,521 --> 00:25:14,960
I'll read it slowly because I sort of like my list of these things.

261
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,160
Here's the final summing up of the opposition.

262
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:33,680
The Greek tradition is to be detached, disembodied, timeless, universal, reflective, critical, rational.

263
00:25:34,001 --> 00:25:48,081
And the Hebrew story is to be involved, embodied, historical, local, and committed to something specific.

264
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:54,640
And if you're in a culture like that, whether you like it or not, you're very confused.

265
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:10,400
We're all very confused, I think, because we live in these two worlds: the thinking theoretical kind of world and the committed Judeo-Christian world, whether we believe and sign up for those different views or not.

266
00:26:10,721 --> 00:26:22,761
But I think it's a kind of challenge to show, and again, it's maybe some possible paper topic if you've got a good example that I have.

267
00:26:22,761 --> 00:26:29,001
I don't claim to have all the right examples, but I want to just say that.

268
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,200
See, I changed the order of what I'm going to say.

269
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:43,880
Sorry, I'm going to say how I think finally, we're still in these contradictions, but I wanted to do a historical run-up to us instead of jump in where we are.

270
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,680
So just save that heading for a minute.

271
00:26:47,001 --> 00:26:54,361
The first reaction was to what to do about it, these two deeply different ways of life.

272
00:26:54,361 --> 00:26:56,680
You see, they're really different ways of life.

273
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:12,920
I mean, either you contemplate God as a completely rational being, as in Plato, or you go about actively doing your individual calling, and those are very different.

274
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,520
So, what do you do about it?

275
00:27:14,521 --> 00:27:37,800
Well, there's a whole enterprise of 1,500 years of trying to get these two together, to conceptualize the Judeo-Christian revelation in Greek philosophical terms, to put Judeo-Christian religious experience into Greek concepts.

276
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,640
That would be wonderful.

277
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,041
Then you get it all together.

278
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:44,920
And this is something I'm going to tell you.

279
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,680
Don't feel you need to know this for your papers or for your exam.

280
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,601
It would be some other course.

281
00:27:50,601 --> 00:27:56,280
In fact, it's my other course, Philosophy 6, where this gets spelled out more.

282
00:27:56,281 --> 00:27:58,361
But you have to run through it just briefly.

283
00:27:58,561 --> 00:28:08,400
So, the Gospel of John, I'm always curious, how many, well, there's several different issues, I wonder, how many are some form of believing Christian?

284
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,760
How many are some other religion?

285
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:12,801
Any other?

286
00:28:14,081 --> 00:28:16,081
How many are secular?

287
00:28:16,081 --> 00:28:17,601
Don't have any particular religion.

288
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,761
Well, well, well, it's a secular age.

289
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:27,041
A very important book has just come out about six months ago called A Secular Age by Charles Taylor.

290
00:28:27,841 --> 00:28:30,800
This is just another confirmation of it.

291
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:36,480
He won a million and a half dollar prize for that book because it is so right on.

292
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:48,161
But, okay, I'm worried only for the, how many don't know anything about the Christian tradition and find this all about incarnate gods and so forth just weird?

293
00:28:48,801 --> 00:28:50,960
Well, you're a lot better off than I was at your age.

294
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,400
I thought it was completely weird.

295
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,040
I'm Jewish.

296
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,041
I didn't see the New Testament until I was something like 22.

297
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,081
I thought it was the wildest thing I'd ever read.

298
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:08,481
And I've been thinking about it ever since, and also feeling about it ever since, I guess.

299
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,241
But anyway, now I have it.

300
00:29:10,241 --> 00:29:17,281
But if you did, I was going to tell you, then you should certainly talk to your TA or get him to or her to recommend something.

301
00:29:17,281 --> 00:29:20,080
I don't know what book it would be that would tell you.

302
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,441
I mean, but if it doesn't seem absolutely alien or strange to any of you, that's good.

303
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:41,681
But so then you'll understand when I say that the Gospel of John, of the four Gospels, John is considered the latest, and people think not written by the Apostle John, but much later, in around 200 AD, maybe.

304
00:29:41,681 --> 00:29:45,641
Anyway, John speaks of Jesus as the Logos.

305
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:53,880
You who know the Bible know that John begins, in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was made flesh.

306
00:29:53,880 --> 00:30:01,161
But the word for what gets translated word is the Greek term logos.

307
00:30:01,161 --> 00:30:08,680
And Logos is something like the Greek name for the eternal rational structure of the universe.

308
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:11,321
So there's this logos.

309
00:30:11,641 --> 00:30:13,561
It gets made flesh.

310
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,801
And that's already pretty amazing.

311
00:30:15,801 --> 00:30:20,041
So this eternal rational structure of the world, that doesn't spell right, is it?

312
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,760
Or is it?

313
00:30:20,761 --> 00:30:22,681
F-L-E-S-H.

314
00:30:22,681 --> 00:30:23,721
Is that right?

315
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:24,280
Okay.

316
00:30:24,841 --> 00:30:36,521
This eternal structure of the world, which then gets somehow incarnated, embodied in a particular human being walking around Bethlehem and Jerusalem.

317
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,361
That's pretty weird.

318
00:30:38,361 --> 00:30:53,241
That's already an attempt to state the Christian message that God became incarnate in Jesus in Greek terms, as if God were this eternal structure, somehow got to be made flesh in Jesus.

319
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,960
Very hard to make any sense of it, but I think I can, but not in.

320
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:03,560
That's Philosophy 6, try to explain that John is right, that there is something like that going on.

321
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,041
Yeah.

322
00:31:04,361 --> 00:31:08,840
The Gospel of John, ah, now it was written in Greek, right?

323
00:31:08,841 --> 00:31:12,041
The Gospel of John is written in Greek already.

324
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,121
That's important.

325
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:31,201
And that's why whoever wrote the Gospel of John is trying to state whatever happened in Jerusalem and around there, which people are writing about and is very strange, to make it fit Greek philosophy.

326
00:31:31,201 --> 00:31:33,440
And then the next move is St.

327
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:34,400
Augustine.

328
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:36,560
I used to teach St.

329
00:31:36,641 --> 00:31:37,120
Augustine.

330
00:31:37,121 --> 00:31:41,121
He's really interesting, but somehow there's not room to do everybody.

331
00:31:41,121 --> 00:31:56,001
About 300 AD, Augustine, in his Confessions, which is his most accessible and important book, is very busy trying to put Christianity in Platonic terms.

332
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:13,041
He thinks that Plato's notion of the good, which was eternal and intelligible and the order of everything, is the Greeks getting a sort of glimmer of what the Judeo-Christians now know is God.

333
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:28,720
But it doesn't work out very well for Augustine because he thinks that if you can have a direct contemplation of God, which Plato thought you could, of the good, then what about all these things in the world?

334
00:32:28,721 --> 00:32:30,641
They just sort of get in the way.

335
00:32:31,201 --> 00:32:33,281
They grab you and attract you.

336
00:32:34,321 --> 00:32:42,561
First for him, women, and then later the fragrance of incense and the beauty of stained glass windows.

337
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,801
But all kinds of things are constantly distracting you from the contemplation of God.

338
00:32:46,801 --> 00:32:49,121
How in the world can we say the world is good?

339
00:32:49,121 --> 00:32:52,080
Well, Augustine concludes, well, the world isn't good for us.

340
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,601
It's a temptation for us, but it must be good for God.

341
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,681
But we don't know about that.

342
00:32:57,681 --> 00:33:01,520
And then, of course, Augustine has a terrible time with Jesus.

343
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,241
I mean, what in the world is the Greeks can't make anything of this incarnation?

344
00:33:06,241 --> 00:33:08,400
And Augustine can't really make anything of Jesus.

345
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,321
He plays practically no role.

346
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:14,920
Well, he plays an interesting role, but I'm not going to tell you about it.

347
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:17,880
But it's hard for Augustine to make sense of it.

348
00:33:18,201 --> 00:33:28,041
And it's very hard for Augustine to make sense of how this God, which should be rational and good in a general, universal way, is calling Abraham to kill his son.

349
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:36,121
And Augustine sort of squirms around over that one and finally says, well, the moral is it's a generally good thing to obey God.

350
00:33:36,121 --> 00:33:38,281
And that's what we're supposed to get out of reading this.

351
00:33:38,681 --> 00:33:40,600
Don't think it's a generally good thing.

352
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:45,001
It's certainly not a particularly good thing for Abraham to kill Isaac.

353
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:55,880
So Augustine doesn't, it doesn't work out very well trying to map the Christians' revelation on Plato, which is what he had to go on.

354
00:33:57,161 --> 00:34:18,201
But then, thanks to the Arabs who translated the Greeks and preserved them throughout the dark ages of the Middle Ages, and they found, first they found these strange lecture notes in some chest in some basement, I gather.

355
00:34:18,201 --> 00:34:22,361
And it turns out that that, and in Greek, that was Aristotle.

356
00:34:22,361 --> 00:34:29,400
And Aristotle got translated then by Arabic and then into Latin.

357
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:36,120
And then the next hero of this disastrous enterprise is St.

358
00:34:36,121 --> 00:34:44,761
Thomas Aquinas, about 1300, who puts it all into Aristotelian.

359
00:34:44,761 --> 00:34:51,480
That did a lot better job because Aristotle thought that individual, if I misspell that one?

360
00:34:54,681 --> 00:35:04,640
That was pretty good because Aristotle thought that what the concrete things were as important as the prime mover.

361
00:35:04,641 --> 00:35:08,001
He had something like a God in it, but that wasn't a big deal for him.

362
00:35:08,161 --> 00:35:12,241
What a big deal was individual substances, and that was better.

363
00:35:12,241 --> 00:35:14,880
And there was something else I was going to say about that.

364
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,920
Of course, Aristotle can't think that the world was created.

365
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,720
He doesn't.

366
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,041
Augustine has to fix that.

367
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,400
Aristotle has no place, of course, for Jesus in his philosophy.

368
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:41,441
And Augustine attacks that revelation on at the end, having taken over a whole Aristotle picture of the universe.

369
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:49,600
And all of this has worked out in Dante's Divine Comedy, which, again, I teach in Philosophy 6, but I can't go into here.

370
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,120
But it doesn't work out too well for St.

371
00:35:53,121 --> 00:35:55,200
Thomas Aquinas either.

372
00:35:55,201 --> 00:35:56,801
Oh, yeah, I wrote it down here.

373
00:35:56,801 --> 00:36:00,160
And the way you can see it didn't work out is sort of interesting.

374
00:36:00,721 --> 00:36:02,640
Aristotle has an ethics book.

375
00:36:02,641 --> 00:36:10,640
Nobody knows whether Aristotle wrote these things or whether they're his lecture notes or whether they're students' lecture notes, but there is an Aristotle Nicomachean ethics book.

376
00:36:10,641 --> 00:36:24,721
And people are still arguing 2,000 years later about the fact that the whole first half of the book is about how important it is to be a political person with your fellow citizens, making decisions in the world.

377
00:36:24,721 --> 00:36:31,041
And then the last book says the most important thing human beings can do is withdraw from the world and contemplate and do philosophy.

378
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:36,081
And people still don't know how Aristotle is trying to get those two things together.

379
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,361
And St.

380
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,920
Thomas inherits that problem.

381
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,120
There isn't any good way to get the two things together, I think.

382
00:36:43,641 --> 00:36:53,400
And another way that problem shows up, which is really interesting and fun, if you were reading, there was a movement at the time of St.

383
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,321
Thomas and Dante.

384
00:36:55,321 --> 00:36:56,760
So Dante's putting St.

385
00:36:56,761 --> 00:36:58,761
Thomas into poetry.

386
00:36:58,761 --> 00:37:06,281
He's writing a book about his girlfriend Beatrice that he says nobody has ever written such a poem before.

387
00:37:06,281 --> 00:37:07,961
That's the Divine Comedy.

388
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:20,041
And the Divine Comedy, most people don't even notice it, it's so outrageous, puts Beatrice in place of Jesus as Dante's savior.

389
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:48,121
Dante's able to do it because there's a group called the Troubadours who have started this, taken over Christianity in a funny way and started writing about knights and ladies and how knights are totally devoted to their lady with unconditional commitment and ready to die for their lady and that gives their life meaning and their lady is in a sense their savior and it's sort of a combination of Christianity and romantic and they're inventing romantic love.

390
00:37:48,121 --> 00:37:58,120
They're turning Christianity into romantic love and that's all terrific except that Dante being in the St.

391
00:37:58,201 --> 00:38:04,841
Thomas tradition and having swallowed a lot of Greek philosophy by way of St.

392
00:38:04,841 --> 00:38:15,440
Thomas has to give up Beatrice in the end and in the very end of the Divine Comedy after he'd been saved by Beatrice after everything in his life has gotten its meaning from Beatrice.

393
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,400
He finally gets a chance to contemplate God directly, and then he leaves Beatrice behind.

394
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:31,121
They give each other one last smile, and then the last line of the divine comedy is: Dante says, and then my love became one with the love that moves the sun and the other stars.

395
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:43,361
He was, in other words, wiped out as an individual, merged into the universal and eternal, and Christianity got wiped out by Greek thought once again.

396
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:44,081
Yeah.

397
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:44,880
Yeah.

398
00:38:45,121 --> 00:38:46,080
But does that help?

399
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:51,201
I mean, once, you see, Beatrice with Dante, it happens in two ways, but I don't want to go into it too.

400
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,720
Dante was very involved in politics in Florence and kicked out of Florence for political reasons.

401
00:38:56,721 --> 00:39:07,521
But by the time he gets to the top of the paradise, he looks back and thinks of all that politics is just petty nonsense on the thrashing room floor because he's seen God.

402
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:14,880
And God is so totally fulfilling that nothing else is necessary or fits in anywhere.

403
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:30,481
And so the fact that Beatrice was definitely sent by Mary and Mary is in there contemplating God and Beatrice is there contemplating God and Dante is, what's missing, or Dante wouldn't call it missing, what has happened is Beatrice has done her job.

404
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,481
She's become the way to get Dante to the truth.

405
00:39:34,641 --> 00:39:36,961
And Jesus says, I am the truth and the way.

406
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:49,920
And what's happening is, in the whole attempt to deal with this, Jesus, who's a finite temporal human being, can't be understood as the truth.

407
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:58,001
He can only be understood as the way, which leads you up finally to the contemplation of this eternal truth.

408
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,681
Now, Kierkegaard's going to get us out of that in a minute, but we've got to wait until we get there.

409
00:40:04,321 --> 00:40:17,480
So Dante leaves Beatrice behind, contemplates God, and then 300 years after Dante, we get Descartes, his most important book, The Meditations of 1638.

410
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,040
I happen to know that what date.

411
00:40:20,681 --> 00:40:33,400
And Descartes gives, thinks he's a good Christian, it seems, and gives a kind of philosopher's view of God, who is eternal, infinite, perfect, completely intelligible.

412
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:44,041
And Descartes even offers a proof of the existence of that God.

413
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:55,160
Of course, there's no place in Descartes for loving God, for commitment and covenants with God, certainly not for embodied God, as in Jesus, and so forth.

414
00:40:55,161 --> 00:41:05,161
By the time you get to Descartes, you've gone from the Gospel of John to Descartes and you've wiped out everything that was true of Christianity by trying to think it.

415
00:41:05,161 --> 00:41:14,441
Because every time you try to put it in Greek terms, you can't grasp what's really amazingly original and interesting about it.

416
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,960
And now comes Terrain, the hero, Pascal.

417
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:24,600
Pascal is the first existentialist because he says, maybe I have to borrow back.

418
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,000
I don't seem to have any of my Pascal quotes.

419
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,641
Somebody give me the Pascal quotes.

420
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,441
The top quote is the crucial one for us.

421
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:45,400
Pascal has this big religious experience, and in it, and out of it, he says, the top, quote, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, not of the philosophers.

422
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,760
That's one way of putting it.

423
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:53,241
That's to say, Descartes says, stop this nonsense of trying to put these two together.

424
00:41:53,241 --> 00:41:59,201
The philosophers are doing, and Plato, and the Greeks are doing one thing, and the Christian, Judeo-Christians are doing another thing.

425
00:41:58,281 --> 00:42:01,201
They've got a different understanding of God.

426
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,241
And the next quote, they've got a different understanding of the role of reason.

427
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:08,961
It's not reason that really matters finally.

428
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,560
It's emotion.

429
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,121
It's the heart that experiences God.

430
00:42:13,121 --> 00:42:16,081
The Christian God, anyway, not the reason.

431
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,920
This is faith, God felt by the heart, not by reason.

432
00:42:20,241 --> 00:42:43,361
And then there's a whole thing here which I can't go into, but I gave you these interesting quotes where Pascal is quite clear that this Christian God, this Judeo-Christian God, is not at all like the God of the philosophers, eternal, intelligible, universal, and so forth.

433
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:45,520
So he says, I'll start reading the next one.

434
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,120
The God of the Christians is not a God who's the author of mathematical truths.

435
00:42:49,121 --> 00:42:50,640
He's really aiming at Descartes.

436
00:42:50,641 --> 00:42:53,681
Descartes was one generation before Pascal.

437
00:42:53,681 --> 00:42:58,240
Pascal is, I don't know, did I have a date for Pascal?

438
00:42:58,241 --> 00:42:59,121
Probably not.

439
00:42:59,121 --> 00:43:02,321
But consider him a generation after.

440
00:43:02,801 --> 00:43:04,000
1650.

441
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,561
Okay.

442
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,560
So here's Pascal.

443
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:17,041
And now, and so now he's saying, I put that in, but he's a little more, okay, I guess I'll live with it.

444
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:21,040
So he's saying, it isn't so clear after that.

445
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:27,600
He says he's not the God of the Hebrews either, the Christian God.

446
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:31,041
And he's making distinctions which for us we don't care about.

447
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:39,601
Because he doesn't in a certain way care about it either, because he, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is the God that he also believes in.

448
00:43:39,920 --> 00:44:00,441
But now, the interesting thing is, just I can't say much about it in this course, but the God that you could prove the existence of, like Descartes, is not, Pascal, who's a brilliant mathematician and does natural science and writes this fantastic book of pensées.

449
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:07,641
He thinks that he says, he says one of the pensées, did I put it down here?

450
00:44:07,641 --> 00:44:08,761
No, I didn't.

451
00:44:08,761 --> 00:44:13,241
But he says, we can prove the existence of God and we can prove the non-existence of God.

452
00:44:13,241 --> 00:44:14,681
I think I mentioned that once.

453
00:44:14,681 --> 00:44:25,080
This is to say, this isn't the kind of God that you can prove and contemplate and draw conclusions from, just a second, the rationality of them and so forth.

454
00:44:25,721 --> 00:44:30,201
This is a God, and that's what is interesting, that is a hidden God.

455
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:42,280
You can't get a full understanding or experience like Dante thought he could of the radiance in the face of God.

456
00:44:45,321 --> 00:44:49,321
We're in darkness, he says in the quote in the middle of the page, in the middle of the quote.

457
00:44:49,321 --> 00:44:57,481
He has left men in darkness from which they can escape only through Jesus Christ, without whom all communion with God is cut off.

458
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:07,801
In fact, Kierkegaard puts that one step further and says, with Jesus Christ, all communication with God is cut off, and instead of without whom.

459
00:45:07,801 --> 00:45:21,480
Because Kierkegaard thinks that if you get in the right relation to the God-man, Jesus, you won't even be trying to get into a relation anymore with this super being, the supreme being, and so forth.

460
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,080
We haven't got to that yet.

461
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:44,240
But Pascal's already got the idea that there is something about the Christian God which is hidden and which we don't even need to get there by way of having some path, that there's a way of having Christian truth in this world somehow incarnated in Jesus.

462
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:45,600
We haven't done that yet.

463
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,880
You want to say something?

464
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,000
Pascal?

465
00:45:48,321 --> 00:45:50,160
Yeah, I knew you were going to say that.

466
00:45:50,161 --> 00:45:52,640
No, you're right, but we're not going to talk about it.

467
00:45:52,641 --> 00:46:13,281
I mean, I can say this: that if you study Pascal in any other course, you'll study him talking about the idea of a wager as to whether there is a God or not, and that you can't get any evidence one way or the other that's conclusive, but you've got to choose because your whole eternal salvation depends on it and others, things like that.

468
00:46:13,281 --> 00:46:14,321
I'm not interested in that.

469
00:46:14,321 --> 00:46:16,560
I don't think that's what's interesting about Pascal.

470
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,480
It's like thinking that the Mona Lisa is the only interesting painting by Leonardo.

471
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:26,720
I mean, there's this three pages of the Paul Says, and everybody reads that, teaches that, puts that in their anthologies.

472
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,080
I'm not going to talk about it.

473
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:28,321
Yeah.

474
00:46:54,241 --> 00:46:54,560
Good.

475
00:46:55,841 --> 00:46:57,041
That's good.

476
00:46:57,361 --> 00:46:58,321
That's good.

477
00:46:58,321 --> 00:47:01,040
Yes, that God is incomprehensible.

478
00:47:01,281 --> 00:47:03,200
His commands don't make any sense.

479
00:47:03,361 --> 00:47:05,361
I'm just repeating what you say, you're right.

480
00:47:05,761 --> 00:47:11,480
And that's what the Judeo-Christian tradition says.

481
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:15,081
So don't expect to get convinced of it by truths.

482
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:27,001
You've got to, and that's what he's talking about, just bet on it, because it's a better way of life and a wiser thing to do than to live as if somehow it made sense, even though you can't make any sense out of it.

483
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,321
But that's sort of the last stage in the breakdown of the whole story.

484
00:47:31,321 --> 00:47:32,361
That's what I want to say.

485
00:47:32,361 --> 00:47:41,321
Pascal at least says, look, we can't make any Greek thinkable sense out of the Judeo-Christian tradition.

486
00:47:41,321 --> 00:47:43,960
I'm just going to have faith in the Judeo-Christian tradition.

487
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,801
That's the big break.

488
00:47:45,801 --> 00:47:46,520
Yeah.

489
00:47:46,841 --> 00:47:47,320
Yeah.

490
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,560
But he also does awful things, Pascal would point out.

491
00:47:51,560 --> 00:48:05,641
There's a place where some general doesn't want to kill the idol worshippers and backs off, and God says, you didn't obey me, you didn't kill the idol worshippers, and kills all of them and Abraham, and the general too.

492
00:48:05,641 --> 00:48:11,320
Not exactly easy to integrate into this, our understanding of goodness.

493
00:48:11,801 --> 00:48:14,440
But let's not, you come and talk to me in Altauers if you want to.

494
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,920
But Pascal, I think we agree this much.

495
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:25,241
I mean, emphasizes the unintelligibility of the Judeo-Christian God, that you can't think it.

496
00:48:25,241 --> 00:48:29,641
And that's a big step forward, but it seems also a sort of dead end.

497
00:48:29,641 --> 00:48:32,920
So the question is, what can you do about that?

498
00:48:34,121 --> 00:48:39,320
The last attempt, I have to put him on here, is one more attempt to think it.

499
00:48:39,321 --> 00:48:43,160
And that's Hegel in 18, what, 1500?

500
00:48:43,161 --> 00:48:45,000
No, more like 1800, isn't it?

501
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:45,481
Yeah.

502
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,641
Okay, I'm going to give this another try.

503
00:48:47,641 --> 00:48:49,160
I'm going to put Hegel down here.

504
00:48:49,161 --> 00:48:51,641
Oh, ah, you'll stay up there.

505
00:48:51,641 --> 00:48:53,561
I can put Hegel down here.

506
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,280
Come on.

507
00:48:54,281 --> 00:48:54,841
Okay.

508
00:48:54,841 --> 00:48:56,041
I did it.

509
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:56,600
Okay.

510
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:01,920
Hegel does something he is very interesting and brilliant.

511
00:49:02,321 --> 00:49:26,081
He tries to show, in effect, that Christianity, Judeo-Christianity, is a kind of mythical, somewhat confused understanding of us and the universe, but that through the course of history, we gradually get an understanding of human beings and institutions, which is the real inner truth of Christianity, becoming explicit in history.

512
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:41,761
So there he's got something that the Greeks could recognize as okay, and he thinks that he's shown that everything that's sort of rational and valid in Christianity has been preserved in Christianity, and the superstitious part we could just get rid of.

513
00:49:41,761 --> 00:49:58,720
That's the last straw for Kierkegaard, who is a Christian, and he doesn't want Christianity to be taken to be a kind of fable, a kind of myth, a kind of which has a grain of more than a grain of truth in it, but we don't need it.

514
00:49:58,721 --> 00:50:04,400
Once we get philosophy worked out and history worked out, we get everything that's important about Christianity.

515
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,201
Kierkegaard says, absolutely not.

516
00:50:07,201 --> 00:50:14,321
Now, again, I think now I'm tempted to jump to the, well I am and I'm not.

517
00:50:14,321 --> 00:50:14,960
I don't know.

518
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,121
No, no, I stick to my order.

519
00:50:17,121 --> 00:50:23,520
So if we'll get to Kierkegaard next time, I'm afraid, how many did the reading, which I told you to read?

520
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,880
I'm going to feel very guilty.

521
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,681
Oh.

522
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,760
Okay, then I'm going to switch.

523
00:50:27,761 --> 00:50:30,400
I'm going to talk about Kierkegaard right now.

524
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,480
Kierkegaard comes along.

525
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,920
I may talk next time about how we live in these contradictions and how they show up in our lives.

526
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,040
But I'm going to start talking about Kierkegaard right now.

527
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:44,041
And so you understand what you read right now.

528
00:50:43,201 --> 00:50:45,241
You haven't cooked at the cards.

529
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,400
Well, why can't we just collect them while I talk?

530
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,441
Is that right?

531
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:55,960
You start passing your cards over here and over there, and they're going to collect them.

532
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:00,281
And as we do that, I'm going to switch to Kierkegaard.

533
00:51:01,241 --> 00:51:02,201
I'm going to.

534
00:51:03,801 --> 00:51:12,920
So Kierkegaard is the first existential thinker because Kierkegaard has this amazing idea.

535
00:51:13,241 --> 00:51:15,160
Well, I better let you collect this.

536
00:51:15,161 --> 00:51:17,080
I think maybe I can't do two things here.

537
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,201
I'm going to try though.

538
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:31,961
Kierkegaard thinks that if you push it to an extreme, you will see that exactly how the Judeo-Christian experience is unthinkable in Greek terms.

539
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,481
And how you do that?

540
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:43,481
Well, try to state the Judeo-Christian in Greek terms, and you come out with claims which look completely crazy.

541
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:49,161
Kierkegaard holds that, I'm quoting it now, truth is subjectivity.

542
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:53,321
How can that be when for the Greeks, truth is objectivity?

543
00:51:53,321 --> 00:51:59,001
Well, you have to have a whole new story about truth, which will look a lot more like the Judeo-Christian one.

544
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,880
It will look a lot more like the commitment.

545
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,880
And then, in fact, that's what he's doing.

546
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:13,641
But he's making it sound, instead of thinking it and trying to make it coherent, the Greek and the Christian, he's trying to make them as absolutely opposed as possible.

547
00:52:13,641 --> 00:52:18,440
And then he's going to show that the philosophical story isn't totally wrong.

548
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,361
It has a place, but it's subordinate to the Judeo-Christian.

549
00:52:22,361 --> 00:52:23,641
But I'm jumping ahead.

550
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:26,080
Right now, the slogans I want to give are three.

551
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,641
Truth is subjectivity.

552
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,961
The individual is higher than the universal.

553
00:52:27,801 --> 00:52:34,641
That's the ethical one.

554
00:52:35,281 --> 00:52:39,040
And eternity is only possible in time.

555
00:52:39,361 --> 00:52:57,601
Those are all ways of showing that trying to think the Judeo-Christian story leads to paradoxes, to statements which are absolutely incomprehensible nonsense from a Greek point of view.

556
00:52:58,721 --> 00:53:18,481
But by taking those statements and giving them a new meaning, he manages to, in a certain way, give us a kind of intellectual grip on what is special about the Judeo-Christian tradition instead of trying to smush it into the Greeks.

557
00:53:18,641 --> 00:53:29,120
Now I'm going to just jump to fear and trembling for 15 minutes because I'm so touched and shocked and pleased that you've all done the reading that I cannot now leave you without some guidelines.

558
00:53:29,121 --> 00:53:35,361
So I'm going to get, I got 15 minutes, I'll get to the most important thing about the reading today, I promise.

559
00:53:35,361 --> 00:53:37,601
So let me say a few introductory things.

560
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,281
This is the hardest book in the course.

561
00:53:39,281 --> 00:53:40,481
I told you that.

562
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:45,601
And that's partly because it's such a strange form of writing.

563
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:59,361
And on the title page, you discover that Kierkegaard wants to call it, on the very, very first page, Fear and Trembling, a Dialectical Lyric by Johannes de Salentio.

564
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:02,400
I wanted to comment on all of that sort of subtitle.

565
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:07,441
A dialectical lyric is a completely paradoxical and contradictory thing.

566
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,160
Dialectics was invented by Socrates.

567
00:54:10,161 --> 00:54:19,001
It's arguing by thinking of general principles and then counterexamples and then making your principles take account of the counterexamples.

568
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,081
And lyrics, of course, are poetic expressions of emotions.

569
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:32,040
And this is a philosophical, poetical book, which seems contradictory, and yet he's going to do it, and he does it.

570
00:54:32,681 --> 00:54:45,241
He's going to argue in these anti-philosophical but nonetheless traditional terms about this profoundest experience that he's had.

571
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:49,001
Now, what that profound experience is, I'll get to in a minute.

572
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,120
But the next thing to notice on the title page is this book isn't by Kierkegaard exactly.

573
00:54:54,121 --> 00:54:56,440
It's by Johannes de Salentio.

574
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:05,400
Kierkegaard almost always wrote in pseudonyms because he's always telling you how the world looks from a particular perspective.

575
00:55:05,721 --> 00:55:14,920
And this perspective, we don't know yet what it means, is the perspective of what he calls a night of resignation.

576
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:19,640
Notice that it's a night, K-N-I-G-H-T, and there's a knight of faith.

577
00:55:19,641 --> 00:55:20,841
It's no coincidence.

578
00:55:20,841 --> 00:55:26,920
He's connecting up with the troubadours, with the knights and the ladies, and with romantic love.

579
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,761
That's the lyric part.

580
00:55:29,641 --> 00:55:34,201
Sort of the phenomenon of romantic love is going to be very important.

581
00:55:34,201 --> 00:55:36,761
And there's more weirdness.

582
00:55:36,761 --> 00:55:42,601
Johannes de Salentio is the John who is keeping silent.

583
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:51,161
And then he emphasizes that with the epigraph, where is it that we're what?

584
00:55:51,161 --> 00:55:52,920
Let's see, I must be over here.

585
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,361
Yeah, on page 39.

586
00:55:54,361 --> 00:56:03,040
The number isn't there because it's skipping a few numbers, but it's the one, the page after number is 37, then there's a blank page, which is number 38.

587
00:56:03,281 --> 00:56:13,041
Anyway, this the fear and trembling begins with this thing: what Tarquin the Proud said in his garden with the poppy blooms was understood by the sun, but not the messenger.

588
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,561
What in the world is that?

589
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,800
Well, that says this book is really code.

590
00:56:16,801 --> 00:56:18,641
It's about something else.

591
00:56:18,641 --> 00:56:22,801
And what it seems to be about isn't what it's really about.

592
00:56:22,801 --> 00:56:24,400
And that's right.

593
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,960
It seems to be about a kind of romantic love.

594
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,201
I'll give you more quotes in a minute.

595
00:56:31,201 --> 00:56:44,560
But it's really about a specific situation, namely that Kierkegaard, let's see, okay, I think I jumped something else to get to this.

596
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:59,120
That Kierkegaard, having looked at this young lady, I think she was only about 16, I'm not sure, maybe even younger, from the terrace of a cafe, fell in love with her, rushed up to her, and proposed to her.

597
00:56:59,121 --> 00:57:01,440
I don't know how exactly true all this is.

598
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,160
It doesn't matter.

599
00:57:02,161 --> 00:57:08,080
There's a huge amount of gossip still going on about Kierkegaard and his relation to Regina.

600
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:16,321
And he didn't help any by writing books, a whole book of what happened every day between him and Regina called Stages on Life's Way, a boring book.

601
00:57:16,801 --> 00:57:17,920
This is all sick.

602
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:34,880
But the amazing thing is, like a great philosopher, out of this sick love that Kierkegaard's got for Regina, he manages to discover sort of truths about romantic love and about the Judeo-Christian tradition that a lot saner people have never seen.

603
00:57:35,121 --> 00:57:41,920
So, what he did was he proposed to her, they got engaged, and then he broke his engagement.

604
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:49,001
And that made a lot of gossip, because apparently, in Denmark in 1850, you don't just go around making and breaking engagements.

605
00:57:49,321 --> 00:57:58,041
So, Kierkegaard was in total shock, and Regina was in total shock, and Kierkegaard ran off to Berlin and wrote Fear and Trembling.

606
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:04,441
And the secret message of Fear and Trembling is: if he and Regina behave in the right way, they'll get back together again.

607
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:09,880
Only it's going to turn out to be very, very peculiar and hard thing to do.

608
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:21,000
And then she, instead of believing this book, which was certainly written for her, and which she certainly read, she married a nice bourgeois sane person named Schlegel.

609
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,320
And then Kierkegaard went into new shock and ran off to Berlin again and wrote two more books.

610
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,120
Repetition and what?

611
00:58:28,281 --> 00:58:30,361
I can't remember the third one.

612
00:58:30,361 --> 00:58:30,760
What?

613
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,281
Anybody know?

614
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:33,720
Either or.

615
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,361
Did he write that in Berlin at the same time?

616
00:58:36,361 --> 00:58:38,521
No, that was already written, I think.

617
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,321
What?

618
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:40,600
He did.

619
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:40,920
Okay.

620
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:45,721
So he wrote and and then so now what's what's going on?

621
00:58:46,841 --> 00:59:01,481
Well he wants to be a knight of faith and he's going to tell us later what that is and he's going to do it in terms of and now comes the crucial thing what he calls the lad's relation to the princess.

622
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:09,161
Now let me just sort of introduce that little quote because it's just a quote in passing but it turns out to be important.

623
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,480
I haven't given the page yet.

624
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,000
I'm going to find I'll tell you in a minute.

625
00:59:14,121 --> 00:59:28,480
So, if this talk of Abraham and Isaac and Knights of Faith and Knights of Resignation is a kind of secret cover-up of a secret message to Regina, where in the book do you find out what the book is really about?

626
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:31,841
And that means where in the book is the phenomena?

627
00:59:32,161 --> 00:59:40,641
Remember, I said that every existentialist has their kind of revealing experience out of which they see the world and out of which they're writing.

628
00:59:40,641 --> 00:59:43,201
Well, what is this revealing experience?

629
00:59:43,201 --> 00:59:51,841
Well, I had to tell you as I taught, it's a certain conception of romantic love, and the actual phenomena is in.

630
00:59:52,000 --> 01:00:02,801
He tells you, and you should always, when you read existentialist books, ask yourself, sort of, what is the phenomena out of which this person is seeing everything?

631
01:00:02,801 --> 01:00:07,681
Since I didn't expect to get here, I have to go find the phenomena, but it's not hard.

632
01:00:08,321 --> 01:00:13,681
It doesn't happen right at the beginning, and it happens in a kind of casual way.

633
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:19,440
Now, here we are, on 72, or maybe a little before that.

634
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,280
The bottom of 70.

635
01:00:21,281 --> 01:00:24,801
And he sort of says, in effect, this is what it's all about.

636
01:00:24,801 --> 01:00:32,640
He's talking about a knight of faith, and he says, at the bottom of 70, yet this marvel can easily deceive.

637
01:00:32,641 --> 01:00:36,400
I will therefore describe the movements in a particular case.

638
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,960
That's a funny way of talking it gets from Hegel.

639
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,920
The movements means the ways of behaving.

640
01:00:43,121 --> 01:00:50,321
So he's going to describe the ways of behaving in a particular case, which can illustrate the respective relationships to reality.

641
01:00:52,801 --> 01:00:56,161
But it's these that everything turns on.

642
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:07,841
So everything in this book is now going to turn on this phenomenon and the ways of dealing with it, the movements that you can make, the actions that you can do.

643
01:01:07,841 --> 01:01:09,200
So, what's the phenomenon?

644
01:01:09,201 --> 01:01:11,280
Well, a simple little sentence.

645
01:01:11,281 --> 01:01:17,561
A young lad falls in love with a princess, and the content of his whole life lies in this love.

646
01:01:13,201 --> 01:01:20,281
I just want to slightly correct the translation.

647
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:34,920
It makes more sense to say, and I can't tell from the Danish, I know a little Danish, but not enough, but I think it ought to be saying, a young lad falls in love with a princess and the whole content of his life, not the content of his whole life.

648
01:01:34,920 --> 01:02:00,361
I don't know what the content of his whole life would mean, but that the whole content of his life depends on this love means that everything about what he thinks about himself and what he thinks about the world, about all that in his life, gets its meaning in terms of his relationship, the lad, to the princess, or Kierkegaard to Regina, or whatever.

649
01:02:01,241 --> 01:02:05,161
It would be like Dante and Beatrice, the beginning of the Troubadour thing.

650
01:02:05,161 --> 01:02:24,121
There is some lady in this version of the story that gives meaning and fulfillment and direction and sense of what's relevant and so forth, everything that matters to somebody else's life.

651
01:02:24,121 --> 01:02:28,761
And that relationship poses all sorts of problems.

652
01:02:28,761 --> 01:02:29,960
Let me just go on.

653
01:02:30,361 --> 01:02:39,400
So the whole content of his life lies in the love, and yet the relationship is one that cannot possibly be brought to fruition.

654
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:49,321
You can imagine Regina reading this and finally saying, oh, now I see why it's a secret and why he sort of wrapped it around a rock and threw it through my window or whatever he did.

655
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,840
So that's, because that's the center of it.

656
01:02:53,161 --> 01:02:58,121
And then what does he do on the top of 71?

657
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:08,960
He first makes sure that this reality is the content of his life, about eight lines down, and his whole, and his soul is too healthy and proud to be squandered on getting drunk.

658
01:03:08,961 --> 01:03:12,800
Well, that's Alistair Hanni at his weirdest, the translator.

659
01:03:12,881 --> 01:03:15,040
I'm sure that's not what he means.

660
01:03:15,281 --> 01:03:22,720
You could equally well read it as saying, on an intoxication, or probably best, on an infatuation.

661
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:38,960
What he's really trying to do is make sure that this relationship, which is now the most important thing, which tells him who he is, namely the lover of Regina, just as Dante is the lover of Beatrice, that that's not an infatuation.

662
01:03:38,961 --> 01:03:41,680
It's going to be something that he can never get rid of.

663
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,440
The next sentence is important.

664
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:53,440
He's not afraid to let the love steal into his innermost secret, most hidden thoughts, to let it twine itself in countless coils around every ligament of his consciousness.

665
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,720
That's right.

666
01:03:55,041 --> 01:04:08,480
And now, the next important thing you need to know is, we have five more minutes, and I don't know how this is related to your reading, but I'm going to put this gestalt on it, this way of thinking about it.

667
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:19,680
The issue is, once you get into one of these, let's call it unconditional commitments, or defining relations, because it tells him who he is.

668
01:04:20,321 --> 01:04:25,520
Once you get into it, how do you deal with it?

669
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:29,361
Well, there are two more things I need to say before we stop.

670
01:04:29,361 --> 01:04:37,281
One of them is that you've got to see that, of course, it's a disastrous thing to get in one of these relations.

671
01:04:37,281 --> 01:04:39,840
You become completely vulnerable.

672
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:43,041
What if the other person dies or leaves you?

673
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:48,040
And they've been the whole content of your life.

674
01:04:48,041 --> 01:04:50,361
That is, they define who you are.

675
01:04:50,921 --> 01:04:53,880
On the middle of 72, you can see him saying this.

676
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,361
So the knight makes the movement.

677
01:04:56,361 --> 01:04:59,720
He's trying to decide whether this is just an infatuation or not.

678
01:05:02,281 --> 01:05:05,000
Because in that too, there's a kind of concentration.

679
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:13,000
No, the knight does not contradict himself, and it's a contradiction to forget the whole of one's life's content and still be the same.

680
01:05:13,001 --> 01:05:16,920
I'm reading that because that's what it means to have a defining relation.

681
01:05:17,241 --> 01:05:25,241
You understand who you are by this, you are the one who has this calling or this commitment.

682
01:05:25,241 --> 01:05:32,520
Now, and of course, and oh, yeah, I want to do one more move before I get back to the disastrousness.

683
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:36,680
I mean, and if it were just about romantic love, it would be interesting, all right.

684
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:40,281
But it wouldn't really be as important as Kierkegaard wants it to be.

685
01:05:40,281 --> 01:05:51,321
He wants it to be about any kind of unconditional commitment that you can have that can give meaning to your life and tell you who you are and what's worth what you have to do, what your calling is.

686
01:05:51,321 --> 01:05:52,760
Let's just take two more.

687
01:05:52,760 --> 01:06:04,680
There's a famous one by Luther, and Kierkegaard is a Lutheran, where Luther turns against the Catholic Church, which was an amazing thing to do, and asks sort of why he does it.

688
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:07,480
He says, Here I stand, I can do no other.

689
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:17,080
Famous quote: That is, something is calling him and telling him that this is what he must do to be, and that's who he is, and he has to do it.

690
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:28,121
And then let's generalize it to Martin Luther King, which is timely, what, 10 days ago, or whatever it was, his birthday, when he gives up everything and finally his life, happily.

691
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:37,920
Happily, the last famous speech where he says he's been on the mountain, and it doesn't matter when he dies, and he would like to live to be an old man, but it doesn't matter anymore.

692
01:06:37,921 --> 01:06:40,400
He's done what he had to do.

693
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,720
He had his unconditional commitment.

694
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:50,880
It wasn't to a person, it was to a cause, it was to justice for the African Americans, not called that yet.

695
01:06:51,680 --> 01:07:07,680
And now the question is: once you get defined this way by a person or a cause or whatever it is that gives you your life a definition and tells you who you are, you're in this terrible risk.

696
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:11,920
The risk, namely, that they can leave or die.

697
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:22,800
Or in Martin Luther King's case, he could have just simply went and had his peace marches, and the white bourgeois from the north wouldn't show up and he'd fail.

698
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:26,080
In Martin Luther's case, they could have just killed him.

699
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:30,160
So it's risky to have this kind of relation.

700
01:07:30,161 --> 01:07:32,560
And now the question is: how do you deal with the risk?

701
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:33,840
And that's the last thing.

702
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:46,640
The Knight of Resignation deals with the risk in one way and manages to do an amazing thing: save the meaning of the relation and yet become invulnerable.

703
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:53,281
That's what Kierkegaard claims he's able to do, what the Silential is able to do.

704
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:58,321
But there's something even better, and that is what the Knight of Faith does.

705
01:07:58,321 --> 01:08:01,160
And I can't tell you the difference yet.

706
01:08:01,161 --> 01:08:13,400
And w and how the f and how the Knight of Faith gets something even more than an invulnerable relation out of it, and why that's important.

707
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:18,840
But that's what you should be looking for when you read it or reread it for next time.

708
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:20,760
And now, yeah, we're all set.

709
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:21,161
Okay.
