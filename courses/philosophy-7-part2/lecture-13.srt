1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
Because I had a discussion with the TAs who want to make Holly Martin a tragic hero, but I don't.

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:07,120
But let's see.

3
00:00:07,199 --> 00:00:16,240
Calloway for me is a tragic hero because he's sort of funny.

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,680
What does a tragic hero do?

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,279
He has a role, and that gives him a duty which is universal.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,719
That is, anybody with that role ought to do such and such.

7
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,800
And what he does is intelligible because he does what his role requires.

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,279
His role is to keep people from getting hurt.

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,639
And he does that.

10
00:00:34,639 --> 00:00:40,079
And so far, that's already sort of getting him into the ethical.

11
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,160
But then this is trickier.

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,879
There are two things a tragic hero can do, I think.

13
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,800
Subordinate a lower ethical to a higher ethical.

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:01:00,799
So you can read Agamemnon as having a duty of a father to love his and take care of his daughter, but he subordinates that because it's his duty as king to take care of his troops.

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:09,360
Or you could read a tragic hero as putting mediation above immediacy.

16
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:19,639
Then you would say, well, he's a tragic hero because, Agamemnon is, because he puts his love for his daughter, which is a strong feeling, but it's still lower immediacy.

17
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,160
I mean, we're assuming he hasn't got an unconditional commitment to his daughter, but he feels strongly about her.

18
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:31,319
He puts that below his duty as policeman.

19
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:34,919
And now, but we haven't, oh, sorry, I shouldn't have said policeman.

20
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,360
That's Agamemnon.

21
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,360
But now we switch to Calloway.

22
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,320
Calloway does his duty as policeman, and he does it.

23
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:46,680
It's not a big deal, but it's moving.

24
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:54,759
When Pain is killed, I think it's supposed to be clear that he cares a lot for Pain.

25
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:00,360
And they've really been together a long time, and they really like each other, respect each other.

26
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:07,400
Because he drops everything and goes to Pain's body and tries to revive him or cry over him.

27
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:09,399
I don't know what he's doing exactly.

28
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:25,720
But whatever he's doing, he suddenly realizes that his duty and his role of keeping people from getting hurt requires that he drop pain and run after Holly, who's done another stupid thing and is running down the sewers, exposing himself to be shot.

29
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:27,480
So that's my conclusion.

30
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:34,360
He's a tragic hero who subordinates either a lower ethical, which I don't see what the lower ethical would be.

31
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:40,839
It might be something like take care of your subordinates or something, but I don't think that's important.

32
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:58,120
He subordinates a lower something, either lower immediacy or lower ethical, to what's important, his role, which is a recognized role and which is intelligible to everybody, and it's clear that he does the right thing when he drops pain and runs after Holly.

33
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,839
How's that?

34
00:02:58,839 --> 00:03:00,440
Does that answer you?

35
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,640
Are you satisfied?

36
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:02,840
Okay.

37
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,119
No follow-up?

38
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,880
Why would he not be a knight of resignation?

39
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,319
Because I don't think he's got an unconditional commitment to anybody.

40
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,159
I say not to pain.

41
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,520
That would be odd.

42
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,639
You have to see what I mean.

43
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,359
Okay, good.

44
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,319
Yes.

45
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,839
White is white.

46
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,920
Okay, Holly, yeah, this is where it got interesting in office hours discussing this.

47
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:36,239
Holly is clearly meant to be a fool, as Hannah tells him he is, and he's not sensible.

48
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,640
I meant to mention this, when names are so important, you get a sort of the names get emphasized.

49
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,880
And at one point, Callaway says something, something, be sensible, Martins.

50
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,319
And Holly Martin says, I haven't got a sensible name, Callaway.

51
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,840
He's not sensible.

52
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,240
What he does is not intelligible.

53
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:16,880
There is no universal role for vigilantes who go about deciding on their own what's right and wrong and going around sort of cleaning up without without judicial procedures or anything.

54
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,280
He's a loner.

55
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:21,440
He's the lone sheriff of Santa Fe.

56
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,040
Isn't that the name of the book?

57
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:24,720
Uh-huh, great.

58
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:30,880
So he, and there is no such thing as role of loan sheriff, I think.

59
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:40,319
We can recognize it as something people do, but it's not something that comes with a certain bunch of duties, which we respect, and so forth.

60
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:45,199
That's why I don't think Holly is, Holly shouldn't be anything respectable.

61
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,520
Holly is just a very foolish, naive, dangerous person.

62
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:58,520
He's just as much a villain, or more, more, I think, in the way the book works, than Harry Lyme.

63
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,640
Though Harry Lyme's killed a lot of people off stage, kids offstage, which is pretty serious.

64
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,640
All the people on stage get killed by some influence or other of Holly.

65
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:16,599
And in general, there is a look of melancholy that goes across Harry Lyme's face.

66
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,839
And when Holly asks him, what do you believe?

67
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,999
He says he believes in God.

68
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:24,120
And I think he does.

69
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:33,400
I think he believes in God and that he's a sinner and that he can't help being selfish and that he's going to go to hell and that that's pretty awful.

70
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:48,760
The awfulest thing that can happen to somebody who has made their own interests and their own desires the you can't say sort of defining thing in their life, I think, because I think that's too empty as to say I'm defined by my desires.

71
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,480
And my desires are changing all the time.

72
00:05:51,479 --> 00:06:03,240
And I don't change my identity every time my desires change the way I do every time, if there is a time that my unconditional commitment changes.

73
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,920
Okay, more.

74
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,719
I'm always ready to talk about the third man.

75
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:09,160
I love the third man.

76
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:17,159
But I'm ready also, and I think I like it that you're not saying anything more, because I really want to go on and do the brothers.

77
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,160
But before I do, I want to look at four pages that I marked as something that I might want to say.

78
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,200
Oh, yeah, I wanted to say a few quick things that I didn't think came across clear enough.

79
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:43,040
That maybe you all understand this, that to be a knight of faith and to be a human being who is totally fulfilled and in bliss and so forth is at the same time to be in anguish.

80
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:53,920
That's the whole point of this peculiar religion that's so unlike Buddhism or any other religion, I suppose, because Buddhism is the only one I really know a little about.

81
00:06:53,920 --> 00:07:08,240
But anyway, the idea of the Greek kind of religions, and Buddhism may have influenced Plato, is to get happiness by getting rid of suffering, by getting rid of the contradiction.

82
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:20,720
Whereas starting with, well, really starting with Jesus, Pascal would say, but starting by being recognized by Pascal anyway, there's something absolutely special about Christianity.

83
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:28,079
It recognizes the contradictoriness of the self, and it recognizes that you can't have bliss without anguish.

84
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:30,000
They just go together.

85
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:30,640
Was that clear?

86
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,400
How many thought I was clear already, and I'm wasting my breath?

87
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,160
Well, then it was worth saying.

88
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,200
How many thought it wasn't clear already, and they've been enlightened?

89
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,640
Hardly worth saying.

90
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,160
But anyway, I'm happy to see that you can raise your hand.

91
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:45,920
You can move your arms.

92
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,680
Let's see now.

93
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,200
What else is here?

94
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,520
And the question about somebody asked, these are good questions that come up in office hours.

95
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:58,080
Can you fall back into despair once you've been out of despair?

96
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,200
I think not.

97
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:10,880
I think, I mean, to get out of despair, you have to have been in despair and saved by having a defining commitment in a way that nothing could ever take it away from you.

98
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,120
That second clause is the important thing.

99
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,120
Once you've got a defining relation, you might lose it, and that might lead you to despair, like the French woman.

100
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:31,480
But if you've got a defining relation and faith, then you will always have a new Isaac, and you will always somehow have a new ethic, although you can't picture what that could mean in either case.

101
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:40,040
But the point is, in the world of the spirit, nothing bad can happen to you if you've got faith.

102
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,880
That's the divine comedy.

103
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,120
The good wins out always, and the bad loses, always.

104
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:58,120
And once you've got faith and an unconditional commitment, and therefore are out of despair, you're always out.

105
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:05,640
And it's related to a phrase of Paul's, which I find interesting in the Bible, saying, Paul, of being a slave to righteousness.

106
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:17,800
I think that that means when you're in the right relation to unconditional commitment and to the field of all things are possible, nothing can get you out of it.

107
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,319
I'm not sure that's right.

108
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:20,919
I put that as a challenge.

109
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,400
I can't quote any Kierkegaard that says it.

110
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,680
Okay, I think that might be it.

111
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,360
Yeah, okay, yeah.

112
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:32,200
I don't think you can tell from the outside.

113
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:55,480
For instance, if we hadn't seen the French woman give her moan of utter sadness and know the whole context in which that happened in the movie, if we had just sort of walked in and seen her, we wouldn't have recognized that as despair, unless we were Kierkegaard or Dostoevsky, some very sensitive person.

114
00:09:55,479 --> 00:10:04,800
I mean, there is something about the glide of a person with infinite resignation, which, if you were sensitive, you could see it.

115
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:09,839
And you know, if you read Kierkegaard that all knights of infinite resignation are in despair.

116
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,560
So you, in principle, could recognize them, I think.

117
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,280
But most of the time, I think, you couldn't.

118
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,079
And lots of the time, they don't even know they're in despair.

119
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,600
So it isn't as if, I mean, I can't say to Beatrice, well, they don't, you can't recognize them, but they at least know.

120
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:28,719
No, they don't know.

121
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:30,160
And we're back to that again.

122
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,360
All of you are in despair, and very few of you know it.

123
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,999
Not all of you, almost all of you are in despair.

124
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:38,720
Some of you may be Knights of Faith sitting out there.

125
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,680
And the Knights of Faith know it because they're in anguish and bliss at the same time.

126
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,000
But lots of you are in despair, and you don't know it.

127
00:10:49,999 --> 00:11:20,799
But when you finally do get pushed into despair by, you will know that you always were, because there's only one way that a human life can work, and that is by having an infinite unconditional commitment, which gets together the finite and the infinite and the temporal and the eternal and the possible and necessary and does it in a way in the field of faith, in the field of all things are possible, and thereby is out of, is in bliss and in anguish.

128
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:23,279
Okay, that's it.

129
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,479
I'm ready to go to the brothers.

130
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:25,519
You're ready to go to the brothers.

131
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,440
How many have been reading the brothers?

132
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,400
Oh, wow, well, that's sure we should go to the brothers.

133
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,160
Absolutely, right away.

134
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,759
I'm happy we're there.

135
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,400
Okay.

136
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,920
Everybody's with me.

137
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:48,400
Now, I'm going to tell you some background things, which you probably have figured out for yourself, but it just helps to make them clear.

138
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,959
You've surely figured out for yourself, all the brothers are very young.

139
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:57,799
They're pretty much your age, maybe a little older, in their early 20s.

140
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,479
And that, but something else you may begin to notice.

141
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,199
How many of you have read other Russian novels?

142
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:08,440
How many have read War and Peace?

143
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:10,920
But a lot of you have read Crime and Punishment.

144
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,440
How many have read Crime and Punishment?

145
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:12,840
Okay.

146
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:18,680
Well, you know in Russian novels that characters have so many names that it's hard to keep track.

147
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,239
That's why I gave you the name chart.

148
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:25,799
That is, but I'm going to tell you something that isn't something you can't see from the chart.

149
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:39,559
That is, to begin with, let's just, I once had the inspiration, I think, to say to myself and to you that it isn't just Russian novels where everybody has so many names you can hardly keep track.

150
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,719
American novels have it too.

151
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:50,199
It's just we're so used to it that we don't even notice that characters can have something like five or six different, very different names, and we know that they're all the same.

152
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:51,719
Here's my example.

153
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:52,760
This guy, Mr.

154
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:59,640
Smith, is William, Bill, Billy, Will, and Willie, at least.

155
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,959
And I probably left some out.

156
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:12,040
Now, what's important is, one, to see that when you read it, you have no trouble as they come around recognizing that William, oddly enough, is the same person as Bill.

157
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:17,400
I'm always amazed the way that John is the same person as Jack, but I finally gotten used to it.

158
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,759
That's right, isn't it?

159
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:19,799
I think so.

160
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,719
But you get used to it.

161
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:33,759
But the one thing I'm going to tell you that you don't notice, and my chart doesn't tell you either, is that it's important what of these many names the person is called.

162
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:40,799
That is, it's important to know who call that some people are call that you call this.

163
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,999
Who calls, well, my favorite example is, in this case, Charlie.

164
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:49,359
Charlie Brown is called Charlie by everybody.

165
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:58,799
When one day the girl who cares a lot about him, I forget what her name is, calls him Charles, it's just an amazing shock to everybody.

166
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:01,279
And the same goes on here.

167
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:06,640
It's very, you've got to be tuned in to which names are being used for these people.

168
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:12,160
Now, for instance, Mitya is, how many know?

169
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,440
Dimitri.

170
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:26,719
Dimitri is Mitya, and people call Dimitri Mitya about half the time, meaning that he's sort of on friendly relations with half the people and sort of more impersonal relations with the other half.

171
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:30,160
Now, that's not at all true of Alexei.

172
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,119
Who is Alexei?

173
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,039
It's harder for you to even know.

174
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,240
Alyosha.

175
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,039
But practically nobody calls him Alexei.

176
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,719
The narrator maybe.

177
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:45,440
But all the people in the book are on friendly terms with him, and so everybody calls him Alexei.

178
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,279
Can you think of which brother nobody calls by a nickname?

179
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,160
Almost nobody?

180
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,920
I finally found occasional.

181
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:53,199
Yvonne.

182
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,759
Yep, the narrator always calls him Yvonne.

183
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:57,440
Everybody calls him Yvonne.

184
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:03,359
One person calls him Vanka, and that is his father, old Karamatsov.

185
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:22,440
And way late in the book, there's a song about Vanka, which, if you don't recognize that that's really a song about Yvonne, you miss something very important that's happening, which I missed for years, because how should you know that that Vanka song is taken to heart by Yvonne when he hears it?

186
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:23,639
So let's see now.

187
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,239
We've done Dmitry Alexei Yvonne.

188
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,999
Seems to me somebody's missing.

189
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:34,039
Well, there are two people missing.

190
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:37,880
Old Terematsov, I forget what they call him.

191
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,239
Who do they, what's it?

192
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,920
Does he have a first name?

193
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,279
I just made it up.

194
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:42,839
What?

195
00:15:43,479 --> 00:15:44,920
Fedor, of course.

196
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:59,319
So, and he's called, and Freud was very interested in the fact that old Terevatsov is called, that the father, because Fedor Dostoevsky is also called Theodore.

197
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,199
And you might want to ask yourself, what is it?

198
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,400
Why is Dostoevsky giving this villain in the book his own name?

199
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,400
But I don't have any interesting answer to that.

200
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,239
I don't think Freud did either.

201
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:14,600
But there is probably something going on there.

202
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,239
So, and finally, well, let's go through one more: Shmerdikov.

203
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:22,040
I'm pretty sure Smershikov doesn't have any nickname.

204
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:25,239
Or Shmerdyakov is his nickname, I think, more likely.

205
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:26,759
I just don't know why.

206
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:37,480
But since he's practically not human, nobody has, I mean, the distinction, nobody has an intimately friendly relation to him or a formal relation to him.

207
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:46,999
They more or less treat him like what he is, a lackey, and they have whatever you have relation to your valet and your lackey.

208
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,359
Okay, I think I've covered them, but I just want to scan it now.

209
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,239
Let's see.

210
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:52,519
Yeah, okay.

211
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:55,959
And now to the big deal things: the self.

212
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:07,360
The amazing fact is that Dostoevsky has exactly the same view of the self as Kierkegaard.

213
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:09,120
I don't know how they both got it.

214
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:14,879
I think they both probably, almost surely, read Pascal.

215
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,879
And it's sort of in Pascal.

216
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:25,599
I mean, that there are the self with contradictory factors and the factors that give you something to be proud of and something to be ashamed of in Pascal.

217
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:51,519
But I really am amazed that, and I think maybe, maybe, maybe somebody way over in the podcast world, who knows where in Russia or someplace, will be able to send me an email telling me why, how it could happen that this very complicated idea should show up in these two different people who almost surely didn't read each other's work.

218
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:53,199
But we're going to read it.

219
00:17:53,199 --> 00:18:00,959
But you won't see any reference to the self in the brothers, so you may well think that I'm leading you astray.

220
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:05,359
What's the word for the self in this book?

221
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,559
Yes, if you've got it in your hand, haven't you?

222
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,479
The heart, exactly.

223
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:29,759
You'll see before the end of today, maybe, that it's clear as can be that one of the characters says the heart is contradictory and it's too broad, and I have it narrower, and so forth and so forth.

224
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:35,120
And in the heart, there is, there's no special, you can call it heart or self, whatever you want.

225
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:41,199
It's something or other that's at the center of what it is to be a human being.

226
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:59,239
And another thing, as in Kierkegaard, but it's clearer in Dostoevsky, because Kierkegaard just says it, but Dostoevsky shows it, that there are these ways of relating to yourself.

227
00:18:59,479 --> 00:19:21,479
The way it's harder to say that your heart relates to itself, but somehow what it is to be a self, what kind of heart you have, funny way to think, is now, and this is the important thing, which is the right one, which is the good way, go back to Kierkegaard talk, that the self relates to the self.

228
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:23,799
Well, Kierkegaard's got an answer.

229
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:34,119
It's relating to itself by relating to another and having an unconditional commitment for that other, and that only that way can you get all the factors together.

230
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,640
That's what he says.

231
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:45,079
The Dostoevsky shows you four different ways of relating to the self, because there are four Karamatsovs.

232
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,400
That is, they're the three sons and the father.

233
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:53,479
They're really four and a half Karamatsovs, counting Smerzhikov, but I don't think he has a heart.

234
00:19:53,479 --> 00:20:04,839
But in any case, Dostoevsky shows you the right way to relate to yourself, the self should relate to yourself by showing you various ways of doing it.

235
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:13,719
That is, we see how Alyasha relates to himself, how Ivan does, how Dmitri does, how old Karamatsov does, and we see which ones work.

236
00:20:13,719 --> 00:20:24,359
That is, the only test isn't sort of a Bible telling you, or reason telling you, or nature telling you, or Kierkegaard telling you.

237
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:36,719
Dostoevsky wants you to just see these lives and see for yourself which ones lead to joy and bliss and which ones lead to despair and madness.

238
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:43,920
And when you see that, you will understand which is the wrong way, which is the right way to go.

239
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,440
I'm not sure that it's easy to choose something as deep as this.

240
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,519
It may be that it takes some kind of grace to go the right way.

241
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,680
Nobody in the book chooses their way of being a self.

242
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,879
They start with it when the book begins.

243
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:09,279
But one thing is sure: how you should relate yourself to yourself depends, is shown by what becomes of you.

244
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:13,039
So you've got to watch and see in the book what becomes of all these people.

245
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,920
There's really eight of them.

246
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,920
Why do I say there's eight of them instead of four of them?

247
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:46,319
Well, I'll show you in a minute, but I can tell you a general principle already, which, insofar as I've read books about the brothers, which I have read very few, and I would be happy when I say things if people would tell me, again, out there in the big world, whether somebody's already said that and I should give them credit, or whether somebody said the opposite and I should make clear to warn you that they're wrong.

248
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,999
In any case, there are eight of them.

249
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:58,879
And that's because subtly, you don't even notice it the first four or five times you read it, if you can live that long.

250
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:07,999
For every Karamatsov, there is a double, an existential double.

251
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:15,599
And the existential double has exactly the same stand on the self as the brother.

252
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,799
And even the old father, which is what I'm going to start with, has his existential double.

253
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,400
So we're going to start with that in a minute.

254
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,079
But let me see first.

255
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,120
So I went back to what I said of reading my notes.

256
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:39,400
You have to be aware of which orientation each of the brothers has so that you can learn from which one works and which one leads to madness and suffering and perhaps suicide.

257
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:40,680
Okay.

258
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:45,079
Or one more way, I just like to keep saying this because it's important.

259
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:53,879
In existential philosophy, a view of how to live isn't tested by argument, of any sort, but by action.

260
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,359
You commit yourself to it and act on it, and then you see how you come out.

261
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:12,920
Every one of them is an extreme version of the position they're in, and something extreme happens to them, which is a comment on that way of being, way of existing, if you want to say existential.

262
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:18,519
Okay, now, one more thing in background, and then we'll get to old Feodor.

263
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:28,199
All the Taramatsaws are related to each other in interesting ways, and Dostoevsky thinks heredity is very important.

264
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:42,759
So in the history of the family chapter, we learn that old Terematsov, the father, has two wives, so that the brothers have different mothers.

265
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:49,479
Dimitri's mother is Adelaide, and his personality is related to hers.

266
00:23:49,479 --> 00:24:00,119
Remember, she's hot-headed and impulsive and passionate and also strong and beats up, beats up old Taramatsov.

267
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:07,920
And people choose professions, by the way, which of course fit their heredity and their stand on the self, too.

268
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,199
What profession has Dmitry got?

269
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,400
Yeah, soldier.

270
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,199
He's in the army.

271
00:24:13,199 --> 00:24:18,959
He had a tough, strong, aggressive mother, and he's tough and strong and aggressive too.

272
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:26,879
Now, what's really much more interesting is that Yvonne and Alyasha have the same mother, Sophia.

273
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:34,080
Sophia is a kind of religious person, very weak and meek.

274
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,360
I'm going to say not weak.

275
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,279
She's weak too, but that's not important.

276
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,160
Meek.

277
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:46,719
And she is has, to my amazement, and you learn something new every time you read this.

278
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:55,359
I didn't ever notice before she has the kind of mental condition that she experiences devils.

279
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,879
I wrote that in the back of my book because I was so surprised.

280
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,519
I'll tell you why I'm so surprised in a minute.

281
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:02,959
You'll be surprised too.

282
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:16,239
On page 11, in the middle of the page, in the end, this unhappy Sophia, kept in terror from her childhood, fell into that kind of nervous disease which is most frequently found in peasant women who are said to be possessed by the devil.

283
00:25:16,239 --> 00:25:20,079
I say that it's amazing because guess what?

284
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,239
Both Alyasha and Yvonne are confronted by the devil.

285
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:32,479
Dimitri couldn't be further, devils wouldn't be interested in Dmitri, and Dimitri's not interested in devils.

286
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:52,119
But Sophia is in this religious dimension, and she is a kind of perfectly Christian person, but perfectly Christian people can, and even Alyasha does, have a confrontation with the devil.

287
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:55,320
You'll see that, but that's a long way away.

288
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,559
So let's go back to where I am.

289
00:25:58,199 --> 00:26:00,119
So here we got two brothers.

290
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,839
What in the world do they have in common?

291
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,559
Yvonne, you'll see, but you know already, is an intellectual.

292
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:09,880
I don't know about you, but let's find out.

293
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,280
When I read it, I identified with Yvonne.

294
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,640
He was my favorite character.

295
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,080
He went to the university.

296
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:18,599
He had a job to support himself.

297
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,839
He was on work study.

298
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:28,839
He studied philosophy and science, would be called natural philosophy in those days.

299
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:30,360
But maybe you didn't.

300
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,279
How many identify with Ivan?

301
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:33,560
Okay, that's interesting.

302
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,639
How many, you may not read it far enough to know yet.

303
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,559
How many identify with Dimitri?

304
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,560
See, Dimitri's furthest from us.

305
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:40,599
Okay, I thought so too.

306
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,079
Well, how many identify with Alyasha?

307
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,239
Ah, well, that's nice.

308
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,119
You're onto something I wasn't onto when I was reading it.

309
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:56,839
So, okay, so, but we don't understand yet what Yvonne and Alyasha have in common.

310
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:04,199
What they have in common is something that I can't really explain.

311
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:08,440
I can only, I don't even know if I can find a name for it.

312
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:10,280
I'll explain it when I get there.

313
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:16,999
Well, roughly, each in their own way is concerned with purity.

314
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:22,519
But what purity means to Yvonne and what purity means to Alyasha are totally different.

315
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:26,040
And yet, they go back to this, this mother.

316
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:33,799
Purity is certainly not on Dimitri's mind, nor on his mother's mind as she beats up old Feodor.

317
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:46,160
So Dmitri certainly couldn't be the brother of either of those two brothers without having, they're introducing a different wife.

318
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,719
Yeah.

319
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,079
Ivan and Alyosha.

320
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:55,999
Yeah, well, I think that's right, but I think there's a deeper thing.

321
00:27:55,999 --> 00:28:01,199
But I don't disagree about that, but I'm not in a position to tell you the deeper thing yet.

322
00:28:01,199 --> 00:28:07,599
And I can't think of any reason to disagree about you, because Dmitry is certainly confused a lot.

323
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,999
And there's no other candidate for clarity of thinking, but those two, I grant you.

324
00:28:13,999 --> 00:28:15,840
And that's fine.

325
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,599
I suppose Zasima, but he doesn't count as a Karamatsov.

326
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,999
Okay, let's go on.

327
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,560
So now I'm going to talk about them.

328
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:31,120
And in the order, I think, at least I never thought about what order I'm doing it in, but we'll see whether I do it right.

329
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:38,479
I would like to talk about them in the order that Kierkegaard talks about, the various ways that the self relates to itself.

330
00:28:38,479 --> 00:28:42,880
So if I did that, who would be the first one that I should talk about?

331
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,840
Well, let's discuss.

332
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,959
What's the first way that the self relates to itself?

333
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:48,799
Lower immediacy, somebody says.

334
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,120
Spiritlessness, Kierkegaard says.

335
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:56,320
Not even despair, but something lower than despair.

336
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,720
And who could, which of the four Karamatsovs could that be?

337
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,360
Oh, Theodore, absolutely.

338
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,999
So let's look at the now I have an interesting problem, but it's only temporary.

339
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:19,639
Somebody has my copy of the lecture notes, which have the page numbers that I need as I talk about it.

340
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:21,160
You have them?

341
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:22,039
Okay, good.

342
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:23,479
I'll trade.

343
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:24,680
Thank you.

344
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:27,079
No, no, no, no.

345
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,519
I can see why you think that.

346
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:35,959
But no, we've got to find mine where I've written in the page numbers because I don't want to rail at this, but I really am annoyed.

347
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:40,199
Every time I teach it, I get a new book comes out.

348
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,400
No, it's a different one.

349
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:43,720
No, no, that's Kierkegaard.

350
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:50,280
Every time I teach it, a new book comes out, and they manage to make a new introduction, and that changes the page numbers.

351
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:56,999
So somebody somewhere must have a copy of my lecture notes in which the page numbers are there.

352
00:29:56,999 --> 00:29:58,119
Oh, thank goodness.

353
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:00,360
I would really go crazy if I didn't have them.

354
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:09,560
I spent two hours copying page numbers from this, which is exactly the same book, except that it's in this.

355
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:14,199
And they've reset the type even so that the lines aren't at the same places on the page.

356
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:21,400
They've done everything to make it impossible to use this one when you're teaching the brothers, and that's nice.

357
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,679
They made you all buy it.

358
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:33,320
But it's not nice at all if you've got your page numbers and you have to rewrite them all in each book.

359
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:36,920
I'm going to find one that stays constant.

360
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,679
But then it won't be small.

361
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,600
I don't know what I'm going to do.

362
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:49,479
So it looks like we start on page 19 when we're talking about Karamatsa.

363
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:51,719
And I remember.

364
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,400
You start on page 3 when you're in this book, 19 in this book.

365
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:57,239
Okay, here we are.

366
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:13,920
Starting on page 3, right at the beginning, we hear about him about 10 lines down, that he was a person fairly frequently to be met with, despicable, vicious man, and at the same time, senseless.

367
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,720
And in another translation, muddled.

368
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,320
Now, I don't think either one of those are quite right.

369
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:26,400
And I wish my Russian people were here, but I trust they will hear this in podcasts.

370
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,039
I don't know.

371
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:32,319
It may be the same Russian word that's being translated senseless and muddled.

372
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:38,160
And I don't know the Russian word, but I want to translate it distracted.

373
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,999
Because he's not at all senseless.

374
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:53,120
He's a very successful businessman, quite rich, and he's very good at selling and buying property and getting people to give him sort of mortgages, which they then default on and so forth.

375
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,560
So I don't think he's senseless.

376
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:10,320
And I don't think he's muddled in the sense that he's able to carry on fancy theological conversations with Yvonne and friendly sort of, almost sort of religious conversations with Alyasha.

377
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:19,520
And he's very clever in a selfish sort of way.

378
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:25,199
But he is distracted by a distracted, and that's Pascal's word.

379
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,519
And now what does Pascal use it for?

380
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:43,440
If you went back at your notes, you would see that for Pascal, people distract themselves from recognizing their miserable human condition and the fact that they're going to go to hell if they don't shape up.

381
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:50,760
And then they do things like, you know, remember, play games and hunt and dance.

382
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:53,719
And they would certainly play computer games if they had them.

383
00:32:54,039 --> 00:33:00,680
And these are all, and those are all ways to avoid thinking about their existential condition.

384
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:05,959
And that's the word you should have in there where it says that he was senseless.

385
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:11,639
And so he's got these sharp business practices just to show you.

386
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,720
Once I went through marking up this book, I might as well show off.

387
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:23,880
The bottom of 21, he gets good security and he makes people pay their debts and so forth.

388
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,600
But now comes the new part, the bottom of 21.

389
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:27,639
I want to read this.

390
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,680
And this is part of his distraction.

391
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:38,599
Of late, he looked somehow bloated and seemed more irresponsible, even more uneven and sunken into a sort of incoherence.

392
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:45,079
He used to begin one thing and go on with another as though he were letting himself go altogether.

393
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:47,240
He was more and more frequently drunk.

394
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,719
That's not senselessness or muddledness.

395
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,360
He's trying not to think about something.

396
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,880
And we have to figure out what he's trying not to think about.

397
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:06,920
In drunkenness, money making, women chasing and so forth, what is he avoiding?

398
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:14,040
Well, he's not actually conscious of having a self.

399
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:16,760
He's not aware of a contradiction.

400
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,959
He's not aware that he's in despair.

401
00:34:19,959 --> 00:34:24,999
But all that is there in the way he behaves.

402
00:34:24,999 --> 00:34:36,800
So, and you see it in two places at least, on page six, a great revealing story at the end of the first chapter.

403
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,440
How what happens when Adelaide, the first wife, dies?

404
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:50,560
She died at the end of the first paragraph quite suddenly in a garret, according to one story of typhus, or another version had it of starvation.

405
00:34:50,559 --> 00:35:09,920
Now, that seems like an innocuous sentence, but that's a very relatively important sentence because it requires me to point out that the Bhagavad-Chernatsov is supposedly written by somebody not too bright who lives in the town where all this took place.

406
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:20,240
It's got what technically people call sometimes an obtuse narrator, which means that you have to sort of see through what the narrator says to what's really going on.

407
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,479
Now, it could be very important.

408
00:35:22,479 --> 00:35:27,440
There are books, whole books, that are written just that way, and that's the game.

409
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:43,200
But Dostoevsky's not very interested in this game because after a few chapters, the obtuse narrator sort of fades out, and Dostoevsky takes over and begins to describe stuff that the narrator could never know, what people were thinking and what was going on in some other town and so forth.

410
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:55,200
But when this obtuse narrator is being obtuse and narrating, he's got this idea that people, that there's only one cause for things.

411
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:00,080
So either she died of typhus or she died of starvation.

412
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,680
But why not both?

413
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:08,639
I mean, you could die, maybe very technically, you'd have to say, well, finally, what does the coroner's report say?

414
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:17,999
But it's clear that this is sort of a kind of condition of being badly nourished on your own.

415
00:36:17,999 --> 00:36:23,560
Now, that's a minimal one, but it turns out that it gets maximum in the next paragraph.

416
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:35,479
What gets maximum is the peculiar quality of the narrator to talk as if people couldn't have contradictory impulses.

417
00:36:35,479 --> 00:36:39,240
They either do something for this reason or that reason.

418
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:49,640
Whereas Dostoevsky is constantly smuggling in that people always have contradictory impulses and usually do things for at least two contradictory reasons.

419
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:52,999
He talks about that in his notebooks about double motives.

420
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:58,520
So he's invented an obtruse narrator who sees these double motives but doesn't really understand them.

421
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:01,320
Now the next paragraph, that happens.

422
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,799
He says, this is what the narrator says.

423
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,999
Fedor Karamatsov was drunk when he heard of his wife's death.

424
00:37:06,999 --> 00:37:15,240
And the story is that he ran into the street and began shouting with joy, raising his hands to heaven, Lord, now let us thou thy servant depart in peace.

425
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:22,200
But others say he wept without restraint, like a little child, so much so that people were sorry for him in spite of the repulsion he aroused.

426
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:30,680
It's quite possible that both versions were true, that he rejoiced at his release and at the same time wept for her who released him.

427
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:48,679
So he's sort of there, he sort of sees that there might be two motives, but he doesn't see that they're sort of opposed motives because he says, as a general rule, people, even the wicked, are much more naive and simple-hearted than we suppose, and we ourselves are too.

428
00:37:48,679 --> 00:38:01,880
Now, if you see the funny conclusion, he sees that old Karamatsov is not naive and simple-hearted, that he sort of hates his wife and loves his wife, and then he concludes somehow that they are.

429
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:18,639
And that's typical of him, even when he sees the people acting out of double motives, he thinks that it's simple and that somehow he doesn't understand what Dostoevsky very much believes and understands.

430
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:26,880
People are just full of contradictory impulses because they've got a contradictory self and it comes out in all these ways.

431
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,720
So, anyway, there he is.

432
00:38:29,999 --> 00:38:32,239
And now, what else have we got?

433
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,519
I've got to find out where we are.

434
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,560
Oh, here we are.

435
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:41,120
On 21 and 22, I'm just giving you a picture of old Terematsov still.

436
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,400
We have time.

437
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,519
You know, he's letting himself go and getting drunk.

438
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:47,039
I've got that already.

439
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:53,679
Okay, we're going to go to another place in a minute, but first I will bring you up to the date there.

440
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:12,640
We're seeing that old Terematsov has very sort of down-to-earth and bad impulses, and even somehow good impulses, and that he sort of gives into them at random or to it both at once.

441
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:18,320
What we hear about often is the earthly and the lofty impulses.

442
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,320
That's one of the ways that the factors are described.

443
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:30,640
You've got to get used to the fact, obviously, that the factors aren't going to be called infinite and finite, temporal, and eternal, causable, and necessary.

444
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:33,120
The factors are called all sorts of other things.

445
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:40,479
And lofty and lackey opposition is one of the oppositions.

446
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:42,559
You can see it on the chart.

447
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:53,959
Different characters have different ways of describing the oppositions, but they're always sort of, you could say roughly, heavenly and earthly impulses.

448
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:04,520
Now we want to go to the place where it comes out most clearly what old Terematsov is trying to hide.

449
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:12,760
There are other places in here which I couldn't find in the time I had to redo all the pages, but the most important one is on 45.

450
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:33,959
When they're in Zosima's room and they're having this kind of psychodrama in which everybody sort of is freaking out, and at the middle of 45, it's Theodore's turn to freak out, and he says, that's why I'm a buffoon.

451
00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:36,440
It's from great shame, great Elter, from shame.

452
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,159
It's simply oversensitiveness, which makes me rowdy.

453
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:46,520
If I had only been sure that everyone would accept me as the kindest and wisest of men, oh Lord, what a good man I would have been.

454
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:48,839
Teacher, he fell suddenly on his knees.

455
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,479
What must I do to gain eternal life?

456
00:40:51,479 --> 00:41:08,120
So it looks like he's been what he stays drunk and confused and muddled, if you will like, and diverts himself is that he really does worry about eternal life.

457
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:10,119
There are other quotes, keep your eyes open for them.

458
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:18,840
I didn't have time to find them, where he asks at dinner whether there is hell and he worries about that.

459
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:20,679
But let's go on with these.

460
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:29,880
But notice in the next line, the narrator says, it was difficult even now to decide whether he was joking or really moved.

461
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,359
Was he joking or was he really moved?

462
00:41:32,999 --> 00:41:34,440
Both, absolutely.

463
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:45,520
It's clear that he cares a lot about eternal life and he can't face that it's a serious and tries to make it an unserious issue just because he's so scared and it's so serious.

464
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:50,479
And Zosima says to him at the bottom of paragraph, above all, don't lie to yourself.

465
00:41:50,479 --> 00:41:53,199
The man who lies can't distinguish truth and so forth.

466
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,120
And having no respect, he ceases to love and so forth and so forth.

467
00:41:57,999 --> 00:42:01,039
And he admits he's been lying in the middle of 46.

468
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:05,920
I've been lying, lying my whole life long, every day of it, he says.

469
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,560
But finally, I thought there was more to this, but I better find it.

470
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,120
No, I guess that's all there.

471
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:28,560
And I couldn't find the places, I got millions of page numbers, something like five different sets of page numbers for five different books, but I couldn't find the places where, particularly when he's talking to Alyasha at dinner and so forth, he gets overcome by fright.

472
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:39,679
So anyway, it's clear enough that he wants not to think about whether he's leading a life that is going to take him to heaven or hell.

473
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:48,719
That is, he doesn't have it, whether he's going to lead a life that ultimately leads to despair and misery or whether he's going to be able to shape up.

474
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,640
He just doesn't want to face that.

475
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:53,200
So he stays in this stupor.

476
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:57,200
Now, now I get to make the other interesting point I want to make.

477
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,040
And it's surprising.

478
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:02,319
And again, it takes a while to notice it.

479
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:07,680
He has a metaphysical, or I guess their existential double.

480
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:15,360
Somebody else who, always a woman, if it's because they're the sort of man-woman dyads.

481
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:24,120
So a woman who is in a continual state of dithering confusion.

482
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,360
Can you recognize that?

483
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:34,760
She also has an interview with Zosima, and there's something very similar in what she does and says, and what he says to her.

484
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,199
Okay, well, it's Mrs.

485
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,719
Holokoff of all things.

486
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:49,959
I mean, she's a society lady and not drunk and not rich and not, and in every kind of obvious way, not at all like old Karamatsov.

487
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:59,399
But it turns out that she's got exactly the same kind of strategy of covering up what's going on with her.

488
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:05,159
This is on 48, we hear about her, that she's there, and she's a woman of rank.

489
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:08,440
That's all I need from that page.

490
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:17,240
But on 49, up, oh, 59, okay, on 59, we hear a long thing about her.

491
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:23,639
And she's starting to tell her story to Zosima at the end of the middle paragraph.

492
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:24,759
I'm suffering.

493
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,760
Forgive me, forgive me, I'm suffering.

494
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,880
And in a rush of emotion, she clasps her hands before him.

495
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,719
You are suffering from what are you suffering?

496
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,560
I suffer from lack of faith.

497
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:34,919
Lack of faith in God.

498
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,999
Oh, no, I dare not even think of that.

499
00:44:36,999 --> 00:44:41,159
But life after death is such an enigma, and no one can solve it.

500
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:42,280
You're a healer.

501
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,360
You're deeply immersed in the human soul, and so forth and so forth.

502
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:50,199
The thought of life beyond the grave fills me with anguish, with terror.

503
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:54,039
And it does old Karamatsov, too, if I could only find the passages.

504
00:44:54,039 --> 00:44:54,999
Keep your eyes open.

505
00:44:54,999 --> 00:44:55,880
But it does.

506
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:59,799
I don't know to whom to appeal and have not dared to all my life.

507
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:04,800
And now I am bold enough to ask you, oh God, what will you think of me now?

508
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:08,240
See anything strange in that outburst?

509
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:17,360
She claims to be worrying about whether there's an afterlife and the state of her eternal soul, and what she's worrying about is whether she's making a fool of herself or not.

510
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,359
And Vasa immediately says that.

511
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,079
Don't worry about my opinion of you, said Father Zasima.

512
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,320
I believe in the sincerity of your suffering.

513
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:28,080
And that's one, she is sincerely suffering.

514
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:41,280
Two, she's so kind of diverted by her social role and so forth that she can't just seriously talk to him about it.

515
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,320
And he tries to tell her, you know, to shape up and pay attention.

516
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:53,280
And she goes on telling you, telling him about all of her love and her love for Lisa, her daughter, and so forth.

517
00:45:53,280 --> 00:46:01,280
But it's clear that she, and you'll see it more and more if you keep your eye on her, is having the same kind of problem he is.

518
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:17,360
She's really worried about the right relation of the self to the self and whether that's going to take you, never mind whether, they all say it in terms of afterlife, but of course it means whether that's going to give you a fulfilled and blissful life or whether that's going to give you misery and despair.

519
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,920
But they're worried about it, but they keep being distracted.

520
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,840
They want to be distracted.

521
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:32,080
And she's constantly distracted in a kind of dither over her daughter and her dither over herself, but never really focusing.

522
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:38,799
I'm worried about the fact that everybody's sitting here looking at me not nicely, but nobody's saying anything.

523
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,119
I understand in a way that it's not very controversial what I'm saying.

524
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,359
I'm just telling you what the book is saying.

525
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:54,600
Nobody has any comments they want to make to help me say more about these people or happen to know the page numbers where we find out more about these people.

526
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,639
Well, okay, I'm going to go on.

527
00:46:58,999 --> 00:47:01,559
I'm tempted to go back to this one.

528
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:06,039
I wonder if that's probably suicidal, but let me just see if I could find out.

529
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:08,039
I want to find out more about old Karamatsov.

530
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,479
I don't find it in a minute.

531
00:47:09,479 --> 00:47:10,039
I give it.

532
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,040
Oh, yeah, here's a good one.

533
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:28,760
But now I can't tell you where it is, except that it's in the chapter, The Sensualists, the book, Three, The Sensualists, Chapter One, about one page in, but it's a good example.

534
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:36,760
At the bottom of the page, no, it won't be at the bottom of your page, but they managed to fix it, so you can't tell where we are.

535
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:52,440
But it says, corrupt and often cruel in his lust, like a poisonous insect, Fedor Karamatsov was sometimes in moments of drunkenness overcome by superstitious terror and a moral convulsion, which took an almost physical form.

536
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:57,959
My soul simply quakes in my throat at those times, he used to say.

537
00:47:57,959 --> 00:48:10,200
And skipping a little, one who had seen all his vices and knew his secrets, but was ready in his devotion to overlook everything, not to oppose him, and above all, not to reproach him for so-and-so and so-and-so.

538
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:14,999
He's looking for such a person to defend him from whom?

539
00:48:14,999 --> 00:48:19,320
From somebody unknown, the terrible and dangerous.

540
00:48:19,639 --> 00:48:35,519
And that's so that I just want to give you another exam example so you won't so you'll believe me that old Karamatsov is the not willing to have a self, not not willing to face up to being a self.

541
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:43,040
Okay, and now we go on to let's see if I'm doing it in the right order.

542
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:45,920
We want somebody to let's see if you remember.

543
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,159
Help you all wake up.

544
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,159
Here's a contest.

545
00:48:50,479 --> 00:49:02,320
So the first relation of the self to the self is that it tries to forget the problem, that it has to take a stand and it will go to hell or heaven, depending on what stand it takes.

546
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:05,360
Now, what's the next form of despair?

547
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,079
That wasn't even really despair.

548
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,880
What's the first form of real despair?

549
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:11,840
You must have it.

550
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,320
Somebody has it in their hand, obviously.

551
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,759
So read it.

552
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,559
It's at the top, that little thing at the top.

553
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:22,159
It's in despair, not willing to be a self.

554
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,280
Can remember what that is?

555
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,760
That's a despair of a negative relation, negative R2.

556
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:36,479
Negative R2 is the self relates it to itself by denying half the self.

557
00:49:36,479 --> 00:49:38,239
I'm not really a body, just a mind.

558
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,240
Or I'm not really a mind, just a body.

559
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,720
Or I'm not really infinite, just a finite, or vice versa.

560
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:56,560
So who's now, and this is harder, and you may not have read far enough to know, which of the brothers is in the despair of not wanting to have the self he's got, but to get rid of?

561
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,719
It's probably too early to ask.

562
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,479
Okay, let's.

563
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,199
Alexi, no, he's not.

564
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,039
Alexey, no, he's not in despair about anything.

565
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:06,399
Or do you mean Yvonne?

566
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:07,239
No.

567
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,520
Oh, no, no, no.

568
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,959
He hasn't even had trouble.

569
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,319
Why are you saying this?

570
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,039
I'm interested.

571
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,479
We're talking about Alexei, Alyasha.

572
00:50:19,479 --> 00:50:20,520
Oh, I see.

573
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:20,919
I see.

574
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:27,400
Yes, when he's with Dzosima, he's very much almost in tears because they're behaving so badly.

575
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,679
I know what you mean now.

576
00:50:28,999 --> 00:50:30,200
But that's.

577
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:34,999
But he doesn't, you know, when he's with old Karamatsov, they get along fine.

578
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:39,560
And Karamatsov, old Karamatsov says, you're the only one who doesn't despise me.

579
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:42,119
It's interesting, by the way, in case I forget to say it.

580
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:44,200
There's so much subtle detail.

581
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:49,800
Ivan, who's an intellectual, despises old Karamatsov.

582
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:56,199
But Dmitri, who's a kind of passionate person, what's his word for it?

583
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,840
Not disgust, but it's like contempt.

584
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,479
I don't know.

585
00:51:03,479 --> 00:51:04,920
Now I'd have to go back and look.

586
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:09,479
Maybe it's Yvonne who has contempt for old Karamatsov and Dmitry to despise him.

587
00:51:10,039 --> 00:51:23,560
They've all got, they all dislike Karamatsov and got a different kind of emotion against him, except Alyasha, who accepts him and affirms him, and that makes him a nicer person when Alyasha's around.

588
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:36,599
But it's true that Alyasha on 44 of your book is, as she says, embarrassed by the way his family is behaving at the about ten lines down.

589
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:39,640
Alyasha stood with hanging head on the verge of tears.

590
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:59,479
What seemed to him strangest of all was that his brother, Yvonne, on whom he had rested his hopes and on whom he had influen, and who alone had such influence on his father that he could have stopped him, sat quite unmoved with downcast eyes, apparently waiting with interest to see how it would end, as though he had nothing to do with it.

591
00:51:59,479 --> 00:52:02,679
That's a very important speech about Yvonne.

592
00:52:02,679 --> 00:52:05,119
It doesn't much matter that Alyosha is upset about it.

593
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:12,880
It's just that's only, you know, he's upset about it because he's so concerned that everybody should be loved and appreciated.

594
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,600
What's interesting is what it shows about Yvonne.

595
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:23,280
It shows about Yvonne that he thinks of himself as a kind of observer of everything.

596
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,639
He's not involved.

597
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:26,240
He's not responsible.

598
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,400
It's not part of his family that's cracking up.

599
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:36,560
He's just there as a witness, or as we might say, an eyewitness.

600
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:42,800
Why am I making a sort of joke about or a pun or something about his being an eyewitness observer?

601
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,760
You know?

602
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:48,479
You remember how he earns his living when he's a student?

603
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,479
It's important.

604
00:52:50,479 --> 00:52:52,320
Yeah, we'll get there.

605
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:59,279
So first I have to back up, and I think, I've got to go look anyway.

606
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,240
Well, it's about Sophia.

607
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,639
And I think I've read enough about Sophia.

608
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,160
I don't really need any more.

609
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:07,839
No, so we can go to Yvonne.

610
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,240
I was just making sure we had his mother.

611
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:18,400
So they are so different, Yvonne and Alyosha, that even old Taramatso forgets that they're brothers.

612
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:26,320
But they have the same saintly mother, and each one of them is seeking purity, but in a very different way.

613
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:31,280
And each one of them has a problem with devils, which Dmitri does not have.

614
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,120
So let's look at Yvonne now.

615
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:41,680
He is a self-made man, and we're now going to do some Dostoevsky sort of psychology.

616
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:50,200
That is, he's very, he understands that people's early childhood experiences are very formative of their personality.

617
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:53,559
And he thinks that they can be absolutely decisive.

618
00:53:54,519 --> 00:53:57,240
We'll see that later.

619
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:05,800
But already Yvonne is trying to be independent.

620
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:10,840
That's why he's supporting himself at the university and not asking his father for money.

621
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:14,200
And why is he trying so hard to be independent?

622
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:24,840
Well, because he felt that he was dependent on others, the relatives that he'd been sent to when his mother died, and he resents that.

623
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:32,280
The interesting thing we'll get back to is that Alyasha is also completely dependent on some relatives or other.

624
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,440
And his reaction is entirely different.

625
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,399
He just lets himself be taken care of by anybody.

626
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:45,400
He's perfectly happy to be housed and fed and loved and whatever by anybody who wants to take care of him.

627
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:50,840
Whereas Yvonne doesn't want any dependence on anybody.

628
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:55,880
So he's self-sufficient.

629
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:05,640
And he doesn't, whereas Dimitri wants money from his father and always wants more money from his father, Yvonne doesn't want that at all.

630
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:21,240
And now it turns out that, of course, what looks admirable about Yvonne, and what I always thought was admirable when I read this part of the book, is, from a Christian point of view, pride.

631
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,119
I mean, who's right?

632
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:34,360
Alyasha, who loves everybody and assumes that everybody's going to love him, and who would give any beggar or anybody who needed anything, whatever he had, and assume that if he goes around and needs a place to sleep or needs food, somebody will give it to him.

633
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,280
Dostoevsky is so clever.

634
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,640
So I think it's too clever to be something in his mind.

635
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:44,800
I think that he just writes out of this deep understanding of all these characters.

636
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:56,400
But you'll discover that you know always where Dmitry is staying and who's feeding and where he's getting his food, and where Ivan is staying and how he supports himself.

637
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:07,600
You never find, you never, never even, Dostoevsky or the narrator never even bothers to tell you where Alyasha got the nice clothes he got when he left the monastery, where he's sleeping.

638
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:13,679
At one point, he feels hungry and he takes a roll out of his pocket and eats it, but I have no, we have no idea.

639
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:14,639
Somebody gave it to him.

640
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:17,440
Maybe when he goes by the bakery, they give him food.

641
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,119
Anyway, with Yvonne, it's pride.

642
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,760
That is, he wants to be self-sufficient.

643
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:28,800
He's not a Christian saint like Alyasha's on the way to being.

644
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,359
He's a Greek hero, that is, in his mind.

645
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:36,959
He's the one who has enough power to take care of themselves.

646
00:56:36,959 --> 00:56:40,399
And he has, here I wrote it down, contempt for his father.

647
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:44,559
Ah, I wrote down, Dimitri has loathing for his father.

648
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:45,359
That's nice.

649
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:50,879
Contempt is an intellectual way of hating some, despising somebody.

650
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:57,920
And loathing is the sort of visceral way of having a very negative relation.

651
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:03,600
So now he's going on, and he has contempt for his father.

652
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:16,479
And Miyazov, who's a kind of observer of things, who gets things right generally, though he is an intellectual and likes Europe, which is a bad sign for Dostoevsky.

653
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,759
Did I say Dmitri?

654
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,519
Ooh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what did I say about Dmitri?

655
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,240
He is what?

656
00:57:21,559 --> 00:57:22,199
Loathing.

657
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,880
Wait, I'm saying, no, I mean Dmitri.

658
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,200
Ivan has contempt for his father.

659
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,360
Dimitri has loathing for his father.

660
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,720
That's the point.

661
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,040
And Alyasha has love for his father.

662
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:41,640
despicable as he is, the old guy, and almost sort of saves him by way of that love, but not quite because he's.

663
00:57:42,519 --> 00:57:49,400
But Miyazov says on page 15 of your book, about two-thirds down, he's proud, he used to say.

664
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,040
I'm just reading it because I marked it.

665
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:56,440
And he takes on this job to be self-sufficient.

666
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:01,959
And he hates, in the middle of 13, being on other people's charity.

667
00:58:01,959 --> 00:58:09,640
And while I'm at it, and at the bottom of the page, he was forced to support himself all the time he was studying.

668
00:58:09,639 --> 00:58:17,400
Well, he was forced to do it in the sense that he wasn't going to, he was forced to do it by the fact that he wouldn't let anybody help him do it.

669
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,840
It isn't clear that old Karamatsov wouldn't give him money if he asked for it.

670
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,600
He gives Dmitri some money.

671
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:25,479
But anyway, he doesn't want anybody to help him.

672
00:58:25,479 --> 00:58:26,840
So he has a job.

673
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:32,360
But just to fill you in on 13, he has a brilliant and unusual aptitude for learning, like all of us.

674
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,999
That's again why I identified with him.

675
00:58:34,999 --> 00:58:38,840
I said, ah, yes, he's going to go to a good, goes to a good university.

676
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:41,479
He entered a university and so forth.

677
00:58:41,479 --> 00:58:44,280
But now comes the really revealing thing.

678
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:47,639
What job does he take to support himself?

679
00:58:47,959 --> 00:58:53,400
I wouldn't be harping on this so much if it isn't going to turn out to be very important later.

680
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,080
So, at the top of 14.

681
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:08,639
However, that may have been, Ivonne was by no means despondent and succeeded in getting work, at first giving lessons and afterwards getting paragraphs on street incidents into the newspapers under the signature of eyewitness.

682
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:15,360
Remember, I just said he was behaving as if he was an eyewitness to the freak out in Zosima's cell.

683
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:18,720
In general, he behaves as if he's an eyewitness to the world.

684
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,080
Dostoevsky is absolutely brilliant to get in that job.

685
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:24,880
People are doing things that they're very involved in.

686
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,759
Lovers are quarreling or kissing, and people are stealing apples and chasing them.

687
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,720
And you can imagine the kind of little stories he writes, little stories that are little dramas.

688
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,240
But they're not his drama.

689
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:39,040
He just stands back and writes about them.

690
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:40,959
And that's his way of being in the world.

691
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:45,200
His way of being in the world is just to be an eyewitness.

692
00:59:45,519 --> 00:59:48,719
And you'll see how important that is.

693
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:54,239
I'm just curious, how many have got up to the part where, wait, let me think a minute.

694
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,440
How do you describe it?

695
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:58,160
No, I can't describe it without going into too much trouble.

696
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:01,520
But you'll see him putting himself in the position.

697
01:00:01,519 --> 01:00:09,599
Oh, yeah, the part where he's talking to Alyasha in the tavern about giving back his ticket to the world.

698
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,200
Have you got to that yet?

699
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:12,239
Not yet.

700
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,560
Okay, well, then we won't talk about that yet.

701
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,840
So he's a detached spectator.

702
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,999
He's of life.

703
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:26,320
And when things are happening, he's observing and taking notes on them.

704
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:33,280
So, and Alyasha, of course, couldn't just stand there and observe what was going on in the cell.

705
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,599
He's completely upset.

706
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:38,959
I think I already read that line, but I'll just go back to see if.

707
01:00:38,959 --> 01:00:45,280
Yes, that was what I read: where Yvonne is sitting there as if this isn't his business, it isn't his family, it's just an event.

708
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,400
Where Alyasha is on the verge of tears.

709
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:59,880
And you get the hint already that Dostoevsky thinks that this kind of self-sufficient detachment that Yvonne has is a bad way to behave.

710
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:03,800
But just how bad it is as a way to behave isn't clear yet.

711
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:09,240
I mean, it's about as bad a way to behave as you can get in Dostoevsky's world.

712
01:01:09,559 --> 01:01:10,999
And he's an intellectual.

713
01:01:10,999 --> 01:01:11,800
That's not bad.

714
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,600
Dostoevsky doesn't mind intellectuals.

715
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,400
And so where are we?

716
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:26,600
But it's interesting, and it's in a way bad, that what he's doing is philosophy.

717
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:28,680
And why is that bad?

718
01:01:28,679 --> 01:01:33,959
Well, because philosophy is a kind of observing of everything.

719
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:47,799
If you do philosophy, you sort of step back and reflect on other people and your own life and current events and all from a detached way, at least if you're doing Greek philosophy.

720
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:50,039
And Yvonne is like a Greek philosopher.

721
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:58,440
At one point, Miyazov says about him, he has his idea, where Plato always was talking about the ideas.

722
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:12,280
So Yvonne is a kind of philosopher, a kind of Platonist, which means he's chosen the intellectual, detached, objective capacity of the self.

723
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:20,280
And he's dumped or rejected the involved, emotional aspect of himself.

724
01:02:20,599 --> 01:02:23,479
And now we're getting close to remember that the issue.

725
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,959
So, what's his relation to the self?

726
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:29,320
Well, it's a relation that wants to deny half of it.

727
01:02:29,639 --> 01:02:35,679
It's in despair at failing to get rid of half the self, the trying.

728
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:39,839
Because we will see, you've got to keep all this in mind.

729
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:55,999
Well, you have to ask yourself, well, okay, so Yvonne wants to get rid of the evolved, emotional, impulsive, sort of lower immediacy, however you want to describe it, side of himself.

730
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,519
Can he do it?

731
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:00,479
And what happens when he tries to do it?

732
01:03:00,479 --> 01:03:06,639
Those are all things that are going to go on hundreds and hundreds of pages from where you are, so I can't say more about them yet.

733
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,879
So, where am I then?

734
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,799
He has, they say, some goal.

735
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:19,440
And he's got some question that he doesn't know how to answer.

736
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,719
Let's go to the Zosima thing.

737
01:03:20,719 --> 01:03:23,839
I didn't find all these page numbers because I didn't have time.

738
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:26,159
And it's going to be a lifetime job.

739
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:39,599
But I want to go to the place where Zostima says something to Yvonne about Yvonne having, help me find it, about Yvonne having a kind of goal which is hard to achieve.

740
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:41,440
We have to get into the Zosima section.

741
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,199
Where is it in this book?

742
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,639
Somebody tell me.

743
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:46,639
Somebody must know.

744
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,239
What?

745
01:03:49,519 --> 01:03:50,479
About 40.

746
01:03:50,479 --> 01:04:03,440
Okay, now in there somewhere around 40, you find when Zosima starts talking to Yvonne, and it may be at another time, in a different time in his monk's quarters.

747
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,479
I doubt it, though.

748
01:04:04,479 --> 01:04:06,159
I bet it's in here.

749
01:04:06,479 --> 01:04:07,999
Well, if it were, I wouldn't see it.

750
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,959
That's the trouble, because I didn't have time to move all my marks to the next page.

751
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:21,879
Zosima says to him, you are seeking a certain goal which is very hard to find and achieve.

752
01:04:21,879 --> 01:04:24,999
And the question is, will you achieve it or not?

753
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:34,759
And Yvonne is sort of struck by this question, because he sees that he sees that this is, that Zosima has, of course, understood his kind of self.

754
01:04:34,759 --> 01:04:40,119
Well, I'm going to go on to one more thing just so that you can get used to it.

755
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:48,759
That is, Yvonne is seeking a kind of perfection and a kind of purity, which is a Greek Platonic kind of purity.

756
01:04:48,759 --> 01:05:00,759
That is, he's trying to get rid of everything lackey-like, lower, immediate-like, and so forth in himself.

757
01:05:00,759 --> 01:05:02,999
And he can't do that.

758
01:05:03,639 --> 01:05:07,320
And Zosima sees that he can't do it.

759
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,999
I wonder if I can find this spot.

760
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,320
Let's just see if it's on page 70.

761
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,280
No, I'm not going to find it.

762
01:05:16,519 --> 01:05:18,199
I can come back to it next time.

763
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:23,639
I want to find I do know how to find that I want to leave you with as a kind of cousin.

764
01:05:23,639 --> 01:05:32,999
I'll come back next time to the question of the two kinds of purity: the kind that Alyosha is trying to find and the kind of Von is trying to get.

765
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:36,280
I'll tell you roughly so you can keep your eyes open for it.

766
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:44,120
German has two words for purity: one is cleanliness, Reinheit in German.

767
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,199
I can write it on the board next time.

768
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:52,120
And the other is purity, which is in German Lauterke.

769
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:58,440
But what I want to say is, cleanliness purity is getting out all the dirt.

770
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:02,440
It's what the cleaners do, Rheinegung in German.

771
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,200
They clean out the dirt.

772
01:06:04,639 --> 01:06:12,239
Yvonne wants to clean out everything that's dirt in himself, everything that's imperfect, everything that gets him involved with the world.

773
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:18,559
And he wants to be this perfect ideal spectator, like God and like a philosopher.

774
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:21,039
And Ayasha wants to be pure.

775
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:30,159
That means he wants to get rid of all the impulses which he considers dirty and demeaning and selfish and so forth.

776
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:36,159
And he wants to transform them into loving impulses.

777
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:39,119
And Zosima says you can do that.

778
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:42,240
That's part of the Christian hope.

779
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,360
You could be reborn pure.

780
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:49,360
But the difference is that we're back to Yvonne.

781
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:51,999
Yvonne is trying to get rid of half of himself.

782
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,360
He's not trying to take it over and purify it.

783
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:59,839
But now we're back to this mystery of how they come from the same mother.

784
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:09,200
They come from the same mother because, as I said, in general, sort of, I don't know what word, cleaning up your act, no, that's too much Reinheit.

785
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,280
Purifying yourself, that's too much purity.

786
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,919
We don't have one word that I know of.

787
01:07:13,919 --> 01:07:24,400
But in general, they're two versions of if anybody finds the word, come and tell me in office hours or send me an email.

788
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:33,199
But it's going to have to have cleaning and purifying as two utterly different versions of it.

789
01:07:33,519 --> 01:07:34,079
Okay.

790
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:38,240
Now, I want to give, but here's the puzzle I want to give you while there are four minutes left.

791
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:42,719
I just want to read you who is the next person?

792
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:47,839
That's what I want to stop to help you think about w before we get together again.

793
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,360
Who's the next despair con?

794
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:55,320
Well, it's the despair of trying to get the two parts of the self together on your own.

795
01:07:55,639 --> 01:08:02,039
Now, by elimination, really, if that isn't Yvonne and it isn't Alyosha, that's got to be Dimitri.

796
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:08,039
Now, let me read you the description of Dimitri on 73 when he comes onto the scene.

797
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,400
And then we'll stop.

798
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:15,159
Dimitri, young man of 28, of medium height and agreeable appearance, looked older than he was.

799
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:20,679
He was muscular and strong, yet there was something not healthy about his face, which was rather thin.

800
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:25,959
His large eyes had an expression of determination, and yet there was a vague look in them, too.

801
01:08:26,759 --> 01:08:30,440
At the bottom, something sullen in his eyes.

802
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:34,440
People who saw something sullen in his eyes were startled by his sudden laugh.

803
01:08:34,679 --> 01:08:40,519
Then, at the top of 74, a certain strained look in his face was easy to understand at that moment.

804
01:08:40,519 --> 01:08:47,079
And then at the end of that paragraph, the prosecutor says he is of unstable and unbalanced mind.

805
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:51,159
What is the characteristic of that description of Yvonne as he comes on the screen?

806
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,799
So it comes on the stage or whatever.

807
01:08:54,440 --> 01:09:03,959
Well, he seems to be old and yet young, determined and yet vague, sullen and yet laughing, and so forth.

808
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:05,400
Contradictions.

809
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:06,360
Who said it?

810
01:09:06,679 --> 01:09:07,719
Okay, yes.

811
01:09:07,719 --> 01:09:10,599
He's a bundle of contradictions.

812
01:09:10,599 --> 01:09:14,999
And that's exactly what he's going to turn out to be.

813
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:23,559
He's a self trying to get himself together, and he can't get himself together, and that's messing up his life.

814
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:27,879
And just one more, just two minutes on 120 of your book.

815
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:33,799
He says, in so many words, that he's an insect and an angel.

816
01:09:33,799 --> 01:09:41,839
And he says at the middle of 120, I'm an insect, Alyasha, and we Karamatsovs are insects.

817
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:44,479
But beauty is terrible, skipping a little.

818
01:09:44,879 --> 01:09:46,079
Here the boundaries meet.

819
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,959
All contradictions exist side by side.

820
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:54,639
And then he says at the bottom of 120, man is broad, too broad, I'd have him narrower.

821
01:09:54,639 --> 01:10:00,400
So Ivan is, and knows he is, a kind of walking contradiction of angel and insect.

822
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,079
You can see it on the self-chart.

823
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:06,959
And he wants to keep, he wants to somehow keep all that.

824
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:13,199
He doesn't want to throw any of it out, but he wants to get it together, and he can't get it together.

825
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,519
And so he's in bad shape.

826
01:10:15,519 --> 01:10:19,119
Okay, now you keep reading, and I will keep marking up passages.
