1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,959
I've got my hands full telling you about the existentializing that's going on like mad in the last few pages of the book.

2
00:00:08,959 --> 00:00:18,999
And for the plot, you can figure out yourself finally who did it, though it takes a lot of figuring before you figure before it finally gets to be clear.

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:42,119
And in a certain way, that's really part of the existentializing story, because so many people are involved in the murder and are responsible for the murder that it sort of supports Zothama's claim that everybody's responsible for at least a lot more of the evil in the world than they realize.

4
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:46,839
Now he may go too far and claim to be responsible for all the evil in the world.

5
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:53,639
That does seem a bit crazy and it comes, I think, from spending your life in the monastery instead of in the world.

6
00:00:53,639 --> 00:01:07,720
But the idea that everybody is not only responsible for the good things they do to people that they know they're doing and the good things, the bad things they do to people that they know they're doing, but they're doing all sorts of good and bad things besides.

7
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:16,519
And the murder is the sort of prime example of how many people are involved in it and feel responsible for it.

8
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:21,239
But now I'm not going to talk about that more because that's a plot issue.

9
00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:23,639
I'm going to start with the devil.

10
00:01:23,639 --> 00:01:26,999
We have two issues to deal with today.

11
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:43,480
One is the Yvonne's encounter with the devil and then the last illusion's funeral in which Dostoevsky, in an amazing tour de force, answers about four of the unanswered issues that he's raised in the book.

12
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,880
But first let's do the encounter with the devil.

13
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,799
Remember where we are.

14
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:59,200
At the end last time, we talked about the fact that Yvonne had an impulse to confess and to pick up the peasant.

15
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,720
And he did it.

16
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:05,120
And it was very un-Ivan-like involvement with people and everything.

17
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:11,519
Did everybody, oh, can you take this to the here are the sign-up sheets.

18
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,720
People said they wanted two so that they'd be sure and get their name on at least one of them.

19
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,560
So now, where was I?

20
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:19,440
Oh, yeah.

21
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:42,799
Okay, so the important thing that Dostoevsky is stressing at that point is that you can only really do these loving agape things impulsively, because as soon as you stop and reflect, then all the dangers and all the other reasons and considerations that come in make you stop.

22
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:45,440
And I didn't quote because I didn't know where it was.

23
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,559
I couldn't find it.

24
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:56,160
One of the places of the most clear account is when Dostoevsky's talking about Dmitry on page 588.

25
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:04,319
I didn't read it partly because it's got to do with Dmitry's feeling for the suffering baby that he's been dreaming about.

26
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,080
But the main thing is just the last sentence, bottom paragraph.

27
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,319
He wanted to help everybody, help everybody who was suffering.

28
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:20,239
And it says, he wanted to do this all at once, at once, regardless of obstacles, with the recklessness of the Karamatsovs.

29
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:36,079
That's going to turn out, that's already important, because that's an example of doing this kind of crazy, loving, positively sacrificing thing and doing it in a impulsively.

30
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:42,160
And it's and that that kind of impulsiveness belongs particularly to Karamatsov's.

31
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,920
We will come back to that.

32
00:03:44,679 --> 00:04:04,759
But as soon as Yvonne loses his spontaneous resolution to confess immediately, then all of his pride and his sense that he's guilty and he shouldn't be guilty because he's too good a person to be guilty and he's going to go to the trial in a way that's going to show that he's better than everybody instead of by humbling himself.

33
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:17,400
Demetrius constantly taking on the guilt and humbling himself, and Yvonne is constantly denying his guilt or saying, Well, they're all guilty.

34
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:25,799
They all want to kill their father, or just saying, Look, I'm honest enough to confess, all of which just to show that he's better than everybody.

35
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:30,359
But now, as soon as Yvonne hesitates, he's lost.

36
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:43,639
He reflects, and as soon as he reflects, he says, Well, I'll go and confess tomorrow, because he can't really bear the thought of confessing because that would be to be publicly admitting that he's not impeccable.

37
00:04:44,439 --> 00:05:02,519
And so, as soon as he does hesitate, then when he goes into the home, his house, he feels that there's something cold and strange in his own house on 7:33 at the bottom of the top paragraph.

38
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:14,440
As he entered his room, he felt something like a touch of ice on his heart, like a recollection, or more exactly a reminder of something agonizing and revolting that was in that room now at that moment.

39
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:15,960
They've been there before.

40
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,759
Now, what is this revolting something that's in his room?

41
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:33,359
Well, it's really him, or it's the lackey bad part of him, but it's not, that's not how he experiences it, and he's because he's getting his brain fever and cracking up.

42
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:39,679
It's in his experience, is that the devil is in his room now.

43
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:46,080
And all I want to note is the interesting fact that the devil is associated with ice.

44
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:54,080
This is a Catholic thing, probably, I mean, obviously Russian Orthodox and obviously Roman Catholic too.

45
00:05:54,799 --> 00:06:09,759
When Dante goes down and deeper and deeper in hell in the divine comedy and gets to people who are more and more bad, they're more and more cold-blooded people, heartless people, who have betrayed the people around them.

46
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:18,319
And at the very bottom of the ice are the really worst sinners, all of whom are frozen in the ice, period.

47
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:36,799
And the idea is that, and it's just a Zosima-like idea, too, that non-loving, non-impulsive, non-agape living is hell.

48
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:43,439
And the more you don't relate to people warmly and with love, the more you're in hell.

49
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:49,040
So naturally, this fantasized Satan is like a refrigerator.

50
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,679
Well, in Dante, Satan is like a big refrigerator.

51
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:55,360
He flaps his wings, and that's what keeps hell cold.

52
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,280
And here, the room is cold.

53
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,160
It's the same intuition.

54
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:21,559
And so, Yvonne, yeah, it might, except it doesn't make sense, except by a weird association, because why shouldn't if he took the peasant out of the cold, how would that get him to be having this cold, awful thing in his own living room?

55
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:22,120
What?

56
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:25,479
Yeah, but why would he be thinking about the peasant in the snow?

57
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:27,400
He doesn't seem to think about him.

58
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,760
And I would sort of think hard about what you're saying if it weren't for what I just said.

59
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:44,040
I mean, it's just plain Dante Catholic and sensible tradition that the bad people are the cold people.

60
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,040
And the colder, the worse, or the worse, the colder.

61
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,319
I think that's all you need.

62
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,079
It's not, and Dante does, and Dostoevsky doesn't make a big deal out of it.

63
00:07:53,079 --> 00:08:00,360
He just says there was something cold in his house, and this thing that was cold in his house turns out to be the devil.

64
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:14,520
And on 749, the devil connects with Yvonne's reflecting and having not gone immediately and impulsively to confess.

65
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:22,360
He says at the bottom, I swear to you by all that's sacred, I long to join the choir and shout Hosanna with them all.

66
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,280
The word had almost escaped me, had almost broken from my lips.

67
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,920
You know how susceptible and impressionable I am.

68
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:35,720
The common sense, almost unhappy trait in my character, kept me in bounds, and I let the moment pass.

69
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:48,920
So, I mean, the devil, of course, is Yvonne talking to himself, and he's telling himself that he's such a good person, but he really has this bad tendency to reflect.

70
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,000
But he tells himself he's really a good person on 749.

71
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,920
The devil says, I am perhaps the one man in all creation who loves the truth and really desires good.

72
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:09,200
I mean, that's a very strange thing for the devil to say, but it's not a strange thing for Yvonne to say through the devil.

73
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:15,680
And now we have to go on in the more interesting details.

74
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:24,240
So the devil is clearly, and Yvonne says so, his own lackey side.

75
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:45,680
If you've got a self with a bad and a good, or a spiritual and a dark side, the devil is connected with, just how it's connected with, we haven't got clear yet, we will, with what the funky side, the lackey side of everybody, and in this case, of Yvonne.

76
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:56,239
You can see that on 737, where he says to the devil in the middle of the page, Never for one minute have I taken you for reality, Yvonne cried with a sort of fury.

77
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,200
You're a lie, you're my illness, you're a phantom.

78
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:07,760
And then skipping a little, you were the incarnation of myself, but only one side of me, of my thoughts and feelings, but only the worst and most stupid of them.

79
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,319
And now that's right.

80
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:12,000
Yvonne's got it right.

81
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,280
And he's right that this is a phantom.

82
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,160
The devil isn't real.

83
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,080
It's his hallucination.

84
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:37,520
But, and this is now where it gets to be interesting, Dostoevsky, he, strangely enough, although you can understand it, I'm sure, when you think about it, he says at the bottom of 746, not for a minute, cried Ivan, would take him to be real.

85
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,520
But I would like to believe in you, he added, strangely.

86
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,920
So now we find out that he would like to think the devil was real.

87
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:58,120
So now the question is for you all, somebody, why, given all we've said so far, would Yvonne risk sort of madness to believe that the devil was real?

88
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,040
Exactly.

89
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,880
I'll repeat it because they wouldn't hear you.

90
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:13,720
If it was the real devil in his house, then it wouldn't be Yvonne's lackey side.

91
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:18,120
It would be, and he could still consider himself impeccable.

92
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:28,040
Or he could think that there was this bad other force that maybe took him over sometime, but really, Yvonne isn't that lackey devil.

93
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,560
And it gets clearer that that's what's going on.

94
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:35,320
That Yvonne is externalizing the lackey side.

95
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:44,440
That if the devil were real, then Yvonne could say that anything that looked lacy about him was really caused by somebody else.

96
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,960
And he says it on 741.

97
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:58,440
Okay, just so that it's clear that he both wants the devil to be real and understands that if he takes the devil for real, he's going crazy.

98
00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:06,360
At the top of 741, he was exerting himself to the utmost not to believe in the delusion and not to sink into complete insanity.

99
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,320
So he wants to be, he doesn't want to go crazy, but he does want the devil to be real.

100
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:15,240
And of course, that's impossible to get these two things together.

101
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:18,840
And he tells it to Alyasha on 756.

102
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:27,079
Alyasha, the angel, has run in and chased away Satan, just as he chases away Rakitin, who is a kind of minor devil.

103
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:46,160
Let me say right now, in case I might forget, it's interesting that Rakitin is a little devil, and he's an existentialized version of all the little devils that Christianity at one point believed were running around in the world causing trouble.

104
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:58,160
And Rakitin is what's devilish about him is, remember, he's his main, gets his main kick in life by seeing the fall of the righteous.

105
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,520
So that's how you know.

106
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:10,559
And he does it by sort of waiting till somebody's almost despairing because of their terrible situation they're in, and then bringing out the worst in them so that they really are destroyed.

107
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:12,719
That's what he's trying to do to Grushenka.

108
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:17,920
So, but I want to just contrast that with Satan.

109
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:25,600
It isn't as if Satan, the big deal devil, is being existentialized by Dostoevsky.

110
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,360
He doesn't believe there's a big deal devil down in the middle of the earth, coogling things or wherever.

111
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,799
That's why it's clear that the devil is a hallucination.

112
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,880
And there's nothing to existentialize for him there.

113
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,360
He just, there isn't this sort of personified pure evil.

114
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:56,000
There's just this kind of person who brings out the worst in people, and that's the devilish kind of person, and that's what he's interested in existentializing.

115
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,560
So now I want to go back to where I am.

116
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,439
But Yvonne is torn.

117
00:14:03,439 --> 00:14:06,080
I mean, now never mind about existentializing.

118
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:11,200
Yvonne is torn between believing in this Satan figure and not.

119
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:17,079
And he says at the top of 756, about 10 lines down, you would have driven him away.

120
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,440
He's talking to Alyasha.

121
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:19,479
You did drive him away.

122
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:21,000
He disappeared when you arrived.

123
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,839
I love your face, Alyasha.

124
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:24,359
Did you know that I love your face?

125
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,280
And he is myself, Alyasha.

126
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:31,160
All that's base in me, all that's mean and contemptible.

127
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,679
Well, that's clear, but now there's something new coming in, skipping a little.

128
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:37,400
He kept taunting me with believing in him.

129
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,640
And that was how he made me listen to him.

130
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,360
He followed me like a boy.

131
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,360
He told me a great deal.

132
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,480
Followed me?

133
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:49,240
I wonder if that's a mistranslation of some other word altogether.

134
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,799
How could it be he followed me like a boy?

135
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,400
I never noticed that before.

136
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:57,560
He told me a great deal that was true about myself, though.

137
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:59,799
I would never have admitted it to myself.

138
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,320
Do you know, Alyosha?

139
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,240
Yvonne added in an intensely earnest and confidential tone.

140
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:08,600
I would be awfully glad to think that it was he and not I.

141
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,280
Well, that's what he just said.

142
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,199
And again, Dostoevsky never letting you miss it, has now said exactly what he wants to say.

143
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:21,559
And a funny way to put this, but maybe it's helpful.

144
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:32,279
Remember that R2 in the diagram of the self, both in Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky, is the self relating to itself by excluding half the self.

145
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:48,359
And it can be the material self excluding the spiritual self as a bunch of superstitions, or it could be the spiritual self excluding the sensual self as something that's only you're only stuck with, but it isn't really you.

146
00:15:48,360 --> 00:16:03,120
And here, it's again, Yvonne has this stand on himself, that he's trying to eliminate the half of himself that he doesn't like, that is not up to his proud, impeccable standards.

147
00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:11,519
And that's and what Dostoevsky is doing is just sort of dramatizing that attitude.

148
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:26,560
So Yvonne is going mad, and he's by trying to get rid of half himself, and the only way to get rid of half yourself would be to externalize it, and then you would be crazy because that's just exactly what's going on.

149
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,199
And there seem to be three different views about devils.

150
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:41,600
There is a crazy person who really just believes in devils and sees them behind the door and slams the door on their tail.

151
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,759
You know who remember that is?

152
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,439
That's Father Farrapont.

153
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:47,040
And everybody knows he's crazy.

154
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:52,079
He just completely externalized the devil side of himself.

155
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:58,319
And then there's Alyasha, who has Rakitin as his devil.

156
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,079
Everybody has a devil and an angel fighting for their soul.

157
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:07,759
But Alyasha certainly doesn't think that there's a Satan around.

158
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:10,559
He's naturally quite rational.

159
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,599
He's rational about something which is a problem.

160
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:21,759
But I'll tell you, just because maybe somebody here knows the answer, though, for all these years I've taught Dostoevsky, nobody noticed the answer yet.

161
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:39,120
The puzzle on 757, if anybody noticed it, the devil says to Yvonne on 757, in the middle of the bottom big paragraph, but now Smerzhikov's dead, he's hung himself, and who will believe you without him?

162
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:42,239
And now, what's strange about that?

163
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,839
How many got this far?

164
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,400
Okay, well, I'm not going to get help from very many people, and I can see that.

165
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:54,120
I can give you this to think about, and you should run into office hours if you figure it out.

166
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,999
Smerzhikov has indeed hanged himself, but you know what?

167
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,959
Yeah, how exactly.

168
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:05,719
How in the world does Yvonne know it so that his devil can know it?

169
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:08,519
It looks like something really magical.

170
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:14,999
But Alyasha is such a sensible person with reality, and he doesn't believe in anything magical.

171
00:18:14,999 --> 00:18:18,920
So he says, next paragraph.

172
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:24,279
Yvonne said, said Alyasha, his heart sank with terror, but he still hoped to bring Yvonne back to reason.

173
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,239
How could he have told you of Smerzikov's death before I came?

174
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:32,120
No one knew of it, and there was no time.

175
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:34,599
Well, that's pretty weird.

176
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:42,280
But we're certainly not supposed to think that he really is a devil, and he really is magical.

177
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:43,079
What do you think?

178
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,920
All the things he was taking on the devil told him before all of them?

179
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,520
I think, good, good.

180
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,640
That's what I think.

181
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,120
I'd expect Dostoevsky somewhere to leave us a hint of that.

182
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:06,920
But what it looks like is he's so crazy that he reads back what Alyasha told him, namely that Smerzhikov is dead, into what the devil told him.

183
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,120
Am I understanding you?

184
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,719
And therefore says to Alyasha, the devil told him that, but he must have really heard it from Alyasha.

185
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:14,679
Where else?

186
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:16,120
Right.

187
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,920
We were there.

188
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,880
Good point.

189
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:21,559
We were in on the conversation, and the devil never said that.

190
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:25,800
What's the name of this movie of the guy who's got the short-term memory?

191
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,199
Memento.

192
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:33,439
Yeah, in Memento, more and more the guy begins to remember things that didn't really happen.

193
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:36,000
And it gets very confusing toward the end of the movie.

194
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,959
He remembers having written things on his body which he never did write on his body and so forth.

195
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:42,239
It's sort of like that.

196
00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:50,080
Yvonne is getting just confused about reality and what happened and what didn't happen and when.

197
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:59,519
And I only worry, I mean, but it shows, remember, I want to use it to show that Alyasha's view of devils is the best one.

198
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:11,839
I mean, he doesn't believe there are any, and he can't believe in this magical idea that the devil actually told Yvonne some important fact that Yvonne himself couldn't have known and didn't know.

199
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:27,999
If you have any other, I mean, I buy his interpretation, but if you have any other, or if you, with your interpretation, find any place where Dostoevsky's telling us, cooling us in on this, he won't just say outright, but somehow the conversation, you've got half of it.

200
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:32,640
He's showing us the devil didn't say any such thing because we were there and we heard the conversation.

201
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:39,999
And you'd think you would see some hint that Yvonne has gone crazy and reorganized the time.

202
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:41,279
But you don't see any hint.

203
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,959
You just hear Yvonne say this wrong thing.

204
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:47,839
Well, nothing to get hung up on.

205
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:50,479
Good, thanks.

206
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,400
Everybody sign up?

207
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,360
I guess so.

208
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:53,840
Okay.

209
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:05,439
Now, I want to go on to the next issue, which is where something complicated that I don't understand very well either.

210
00:21:05,439 --> 00:21:07,840
I'm telling you all the hard things now.

211
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:22,439
After the encounter with Yvonne and Yvonne's encounter with the devil, Alyasha goes to, says a prayer as he falls asleep at the top of 758.

212
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:29,959
He took a pillow and lay down on the sofa, and then he says this, and he prayed for Dmitry and Yvonne.

213
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:31,719
It's interesting how he prayed.

214
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,080
When he prayed, you'll read his prayer, and it wasn't any prayer.

215
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,479
He didn't speak to a personal God.

216
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:40,280
You can hardly pray to the connectedness of the universe.

217
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:45,240
And remember, whenever Dostoevsky says God, he means the slanting rays of the sun.

218
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:46,439
He means the thread.

219
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:48,199
He means the ocean of connectedness.

220
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:56,439
He has all kinds of names for this ultimately spiritual world that we're all in.

221
00:21:56,439 --> 00:22:05,560
But when he prays, he says, God in whom Yvonne, this is what he thought, God in whom Yvonne disbelieved.

222
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,080
I'm at the top of 79.

223
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:12,040
This is a very, everything has a paragraph that's so hard to understand that you don't know what to do.

224
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:15,080
I have, there's a paragraph in Hiroshima one more I can't understand.

225
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,799
Here's the one in this one I can barely understand.

226
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:25,799
God in whom Yvonne disbelieved and his truth were gaining mastery over his, Yvonne's heart, which still refused to submit.

227
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:27,319
We can do that one.

228
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,759
What is that one?

229
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:41,320
That is the connectedness of everything, which Yvonne denies, denies when in rebellion chapter, denies when he leaves town to let Dmitry kill old Karamatsov.

230
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:52,599
So the fact that Yvonne is connected to and responsible for the evil in himself and in the world is the God he disbelieves in.

231
00:22:53,160 --> 00:23:00,479
But his truth, that is, God's truth, that is connectedness, was gaining mastery over his, Yvonne's heart.

232
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:03,599
Yes, the thought floated through Alyasha's mind.

233
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:06,880
Now, this is a sort of prayer, you notice, but there's no praying.

234
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,439
Yes, the thought floated through Alyasha's mind.

235
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:16,239
Yes, if Smerzhikov is dead, no one will believe Ivan's evidence that he will go and testify anyway.

236
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,640
Alyasha smiled softly.

237
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,279
God will conquer, he thought.

238
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:22,239
That means what?

239
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:29,199
The connectedness will get through to Yvonne because there is this connectedness and you can't really deny it.

240
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,439
So God will conquer, he thought.

241
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:42,400
Ivan will either rise up in the light of truth or he'll perish in hate, revenging on himself and on everyone his having served a cause he does not believe in.

242
00:23:42,719 --> 00:23:47,599
Alyasha had it bitterly, and again he prayed for Yvonne.

243
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,079
Now, that's the hardest part.

244
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:54,079
So the connectedness will conquer.

245
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:11,600
Ivan will either rise up in the light of truth, meaning recognize his connectedness, take responsibility, humble himself for the lacky side of him and for his connectedness, his very important connectedness in the murder, or he'll perish in hate.

246
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:19,039
Now it gets really hard, revenging on himself and everyone is having served a cause he does not believe in.

247
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:28,080
All I can think of there is he dies angry that he served what cause?

248
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:52,279
The evidence, he served the truth that everything was connected to everything by, well, partly by going crazy, I think, partly by understanding that leaving town when he thought he was washing his hands of everything and showing his total disconnectedness, he caused the murder.

249
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:55,719
Therefore, he was showing the connectedness.

250
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:57,400
And this is getting pretty far-fetched.

251
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,760
I don't claim this is a very illuminating way to read it.

252
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:13,880
But anyway, that's my way of reading it: that he can't get himself out of the connectedness, he can't rebel, he can't be detached, and this will ultimately drive him crazy.

253
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:19,320
Or else, connectedness will get through to him and he will be transformed.

254
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:26,600
And as I say, there's one sentence in the book that tells us that, in fact, connectedness got through to him and he was transformed.

255
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,439
I was looking for it, but I didn't find it.

256
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:46,199
But I remember, remember I told you, it says that Ivan remembered all his life as the most awful, repulsive moment when he went out on the landing and listened to old Karamatsov and thinking, oh boy, now by tomorrow he'll be dead, is presumably what he was thinking.

257
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:48,199
But anyway, somebody had a hand up.

258
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:49,160
Yeah.

259
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:55,959
And expect those lack of side, the warn behind the acceptance.

260
00:25:57,479 --> 00:26:05,959
So he either accepts the connectedness or he accepts the lackey side, but he doesn't.

261
00:26:05,959 --> 00:26:09,959
And he despairs because he can't accept it.

262
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,640
I didn't follow you.

263
00:26:17,719 --> 00:26:18,360
I see.

264
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,080
I see.

265
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:24,279
He's committed to the non-connectedness.

266
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:42,880
And insofar as the connectedness grabs him, he either accepts it and is transformed, or he denies it, and he denies the, and thereby he is full of anger and somehow destroys himself.

267
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,600
Is that?

268
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,439
Okay, I got it.

269
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:45,840
Yeah.

270
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,199
I mean, giving it a chance, giving the God the connectedness a chance.

271
00:26:51,199 --> 00:27:05,039
And if it were to work out, then he'd give it the appreciation of his life that he gave us for not having to give himself revenge himself on having long moments because he wasn't actually made to that gospel for his life.

272
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,000
He had a chance, but it didn't work.

273
00:27:09,199 --> 00:27:16,319
He didn't, he was sort of called to admit the connectedness, but he didn't admit the connectedness.

274
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:27,920
And therefore, he has to, that's the weird part, of avenge, revenge on himself and everyone else having served a cause he does not believe in.

275
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:34,240
See, somehow he's got to be in the connectedness, and that's what makes him so angry.

276
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:42,480
He wants to reject his involvement, and he ends up having been deeply involved anyway.

277
00:27:42,479 --> 00:27:43,759
I'm back to my version.

278
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:45,519
Okay, let's hear your version.

279
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:52,880
Well, doesn't Enon end up to be going to this text that's connectedness who wants to dance and make some difference than other people.

280
00:27:52,880 --> 00:28:02,319
He goes to the trial and his connectedness to prove that he's valuable to other people and therefore, sort of murderism.

281
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,839
And that counts as revenging on himself, his serving a cause he doesn't believe in.

282
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:09,679
Maybe.

283
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,679
I still like my version best.

284
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,560
The middle of mine is, but I don't think it's great, but I'm not bowled over by any of these versions either.

285
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:36,439
But I want to say that he served the cause of connectedness by demonstrating, in effect, his connectedness, by leaving town and washing his hands of everything as if he weren't connected, and lo and behold, that caused the murder.

286
00:28:36,439 --> 00:28:39,640
So he demonstrates his connectedness.

287
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:52,759
Sort of God, namely the connectedness, uses him to be an example of how much you are responsible for the evil in the world.

288
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,360
But I don't know.

289
00:28:54,360 --> 00:29:02,439
I mean, I stop with that just because I want you to think about it, because I want anybody who's got more to say about it to come.

290
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,120
It's sort of so inscrutable.

291
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:09,799
And Alyasha says it as if it was just obvious and somehow the book had kind of led up to it.

292
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,920
I mean, the more I say it, the more I like my interpretation.

293
00:29:13,479 --> 00:29:16,120
At least the book did lead up to my interpretation.

294
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:26,759
Yvonne has just had this shocking conversation in which Smershikov says, you did it, you made this agreement to leave town, and you left town.

295
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:29,640
And that caused the murder.

296
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:37,400
It's as if he sort of hired a hitman to do the murder, which isn't as bad as actually murdering somebody yourself.

297
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,439
That's why Alyasha can say to Yvonne, you didn't kill old Karamatsov.

298
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:56,359
Hiring a hitman to kill somebody, which is what sort of happens between him and Smershikov, that is bad enough to, what you go to prison for life for attempted murder or something for that, I imagine.

299
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:07,439
So Yvonne has sort of demonstrated the connectedness, even though he doesn't believe in it.

300
00:30:07,999 --> 00:30:09,279
I'm going to stop with that.

301
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:13,439
I'm sure somebody can do better, but it's the best I can do.

302
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:17,120
Okay, so now let me go on and see where we are.

303
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:28,079
I summed it up by saying that would mean that Yvonne is in the world whether he likes it or not, whether he chooses to be or not, and that's his problem.

304
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:35,999
And that problem is getting through to him because of his implication in his father's murder, which he now understands.

305
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,359
But he resists accepting that kind of interdependence.

306
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,679
Here's my final summary, I see.

307
00:30:43,679 --> 00:31:00,799
Now Yvonne must accept the fundamental truth that all creatures are interrelated and admit his involvement, or else he'll destroy everything in himself and everyone else who questions his self-sufficiency, purity, and perfection, and reminds him of his complicity in the suffering in the world.

308
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,519
That's that.

309
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,079
Okay, now we're going on to a whole new subject, the last subject, the rest of the book.

310
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:19,359
And that is, and I want you to think about how many issues are left unresolved that we now need to find out how they get resolved.

311
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:25,279
I listed them where we don't even understand yet what the founding of a church is like.

312
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:33,279
It's hard to remember the first time reading this, or even the second or third, all the issues that are on the table since the Grand Inquisitor.

313
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:43,519
But remember, the Grand Inquisitor says we're going to give people one universal church, one ant heap, in which they're all together believing the same thing.

314
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,400
That's what they want.

315
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:56,039
And the Jesus figure says, or is, you know, the Grand Inquisitor says, the Jesus figure says, every man has to relate to God by himself.

316
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:02,199
There's no place for intermediate churches and priests and so forth at all.

317
00:32:02,199 --> 00:32:09,880
Now, the question is: is there a third view that would be the Russian Orthodox view?

318
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,120
If there is, we haven't seen it yet.

319
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,359
So, Dostoevsky is going to have to give it to us in those last ten pages.

320
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,999
And then there's the question of immortality.

321
00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:21,079
At the beginning of the book, both Mrs.

322
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:27,400
Holikov and Feodor are all upset about whether there's an afterlife or not.

323
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:37,160
And surely, if Dostoevsky is demythologizing, that is, existentializing everything, he ought to be existentializing the afterlife too.

324
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:42,040
And he is, you'll see, he does it in a way.

325
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:54,360
And then he's been telling us sort of all about the Karamatsovs, that they're reckless, that they're impulsive, that they're sensual and dangerous and so forth.

326
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,360
And so he hasn't really settled on.

327
00:32:56,519 --> 00:33:01,959
He's told us that, in a way, the Karamatsovs are sort of paradigm human beings.

328
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:11,479
We're all Karamatsovs, except that somehow these guys have got this whatever it is about the self sort of large in them.

329
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,800
But we don't quite know what it is yet, what it is to be a Karamatsov.

330
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:18,119
Basically, is it a bad thing or a good thing?

331
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:19,239
We have to hear about that.

332
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:21,000
We will in a minute.

333
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:44,240
And finally, we need a hint, and we've talked about this: how in the world is all this going to change the world so that the star will rise in the east, so that we can get a hint at least what Dostoevsky thinks would be the best thing that could happen to humanity and could happen to humanity, and maybe will happen to humanity.

334
00:33:44,479 --> 00:33:52,559
He's got a sort of good record so far as a prophet because he says we'll see how socialism is going to work.

335
00:33:52,559 --> 00:34:01,439
I mean, the kind of Soviet, a state that treats people.

336
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:02,319
Never mind.

337
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,119
I'll get to that.

338
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:04,880
Let's do them one at a time.

339
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,079
So, first, we have to talk about Kolya.

340
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:11,439
Kolya represents the next generation.

341
00:34:11,439 --> 00:34:13,920
He is the smartest young man.

342
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,639
How is he?

343
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,159
17 or younger?

344
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,280
I forget.

345
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,199
14.

346
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:21,280
Okay, 14.

347
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:32,800
And he's, and the angel versus devil battle for him is very important because which way he goes has a lot to do with which way the world is going to go.

348
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:39,439
And so we will see just what we expect to see: Rakitin and Alyasha fighting for his soul.

349
00:34:39,439 --> 00:34:43,680
They're talking about all sorts of things on 639.

350
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:53,120
And Kolya is giving all sorts of atheist kind of answers and socialist kind of answers.

351
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:59,360
And talking about there's no, if there were a little two-thirds down, if there were no God, he would have to be invented.

352
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,639
Kolya began to blush.

353
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:04,240
He suddenly felt that Alyasha might think he was trying to show off.

354
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,760
And I must confess I can't stand such discussions, he said with a final air.

355
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,600
It's possible for one who doesn't believe in God to love mankind, don't you think so?

356
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:17,800
Voltaire didn't believe in God and he loved mankind.

357
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,479
I'm at it again, he thought.

358
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,359
Alyasha answers very sensibly: Voltaire believed in God, though not very much.

359
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:29,560
That isn't the correct connectedness and so forth, I think.

360
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:32,760
And I don't think he loved mankind very much either.

361
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:39,640
So believing in the connectedness and loving your fellow human beings comes to the same thing.

362
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:52,439
You can't believe, love your fellow human beings and not believe in God, and you can't believe in God and not love your fellow human beings because God just is the loving connectedness of everything.

363
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:59,080
Now, I want to ask the Russian consultant, again, Alex, I hope you're listening.

364
00:35:59,959 --> 00:36:02,920
I worry about the bottom of 639.

365
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:07,400
Either Dostoevsky's making a mistake or the translator's making a mistake.

366
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:17,080
Because it's right for Rakitin and Kolya to talk about whether you love mankind or not.

367
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:18,920
But you see, that's the wrong way.

368
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,920
Alyasha shouldn't think about that.

369
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,000
That's like loving humanity.

370
00:36:22,999 --> 00:36:29,880
And remember, if you love humanity, that's not like loving your neighbor, particular people in your vicinity.

371
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,599
And it's the wrong thing to love humanity.

372
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:34,599
Yvonne says he loves humanity.

373
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:37,000
He just doesn't like any particular people.

374
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,880
They're all so inferior and awful.

375
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:57,400
So it's all very well for Kolya to talk about whether Voltaire loves mankind or not, but it it ought to be at the he-he ought to, Alyasha ought to say, I don't think he loved any particular people very much.

376
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:03,840
And and he and he and he doesn't love God either.

377
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:06,720
But I don't know I don't know what's happening there, I'm just curious.

378
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:15,119
But the point is, anyway, you can't if you have the right relation to God, you have a loving relation to your neighbor.

379
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:15,920
It's not news.

380
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:23,200
I mean, it's a part of the Christian story that Dostoevsky's been saying over and over.

381
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:33,119
But then after he says another page of stupid things, and it says in the middle that he's a socialist, he says, I'm in the middle of 640.

382
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,439
I'm an incurable socialist, he announced suddenly.

383
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:37,519
A socialist laughed Alyasha.

384
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:39,600
When have you had time to become one?

385
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,520
And you're only 13.

386
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,160
I thought you were, yeah, he's 13, it turns out.

387
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:51,520
And how has he come to be a socialist and have these views about Voltaire, about whom he knows nothing and so forth?

388
00:37:51,519 --> 00:38:02,479
Well, of course, from Rakitin, who's, if he can get him into being a socialist, and materialists, an atheist, is making a big step against the star rising in the East.

389
00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:14,639
So it turns out on 641 at the top, it happens I've often talked to Rakitin, the divinity student, and then they're talking about some Russian political philosopher, and I don't know anything about it.

390
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:17,920
It doesn't matter what, which particular thing.

391
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,720
It's just that it's some socialist thing.

392
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,039
Now, where am I?

393
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:48,680
So Dostoevsky thinks that the kind of socialism that Kolya believes in, is going to end up in bloodshed and destruction because natural human beings, remember, are not are vicious and selfish and so forth.

394
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,760
You can't make a state out of them.

395
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,680
They won't form a community.

396
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,439
They won't really cooperate.

397
00:38:54,439 --> 00:38:59,959
And so he's predicting the destruction of the Soviet Union, in effect.

398
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:05,959
If the Russians will try, if the Russians try this kind of move, it's not going to work.

399
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:10,039
You can't have, from Dostoevsky's point of view, a state.

400
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,239
You can only have Christian socialism.

401
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:18,040
You can't have secular state socialism.

402
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:23,880
And of course it's the devil that makes that that's causing all this.

403
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:29,000
Just to mention the devil, so Dostoevsky keeps you tuned in in the middle of 644.

404
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:34,600
Alyasha says the devil has taken the form of vanity and entered in the whole generation.

405
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:36,040
It's the devil.

406
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:41,319
And he sees the effect of Rakitin.

407
00:39:41,959 --> 00:39:48,760
And then, backing up a little, how does he win Kolya over?

408
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:54,360
I mean, he lets Kolya make a fool of himself, and he shows Kolya that what he's saying doesn't make any sense.

409
00:39:54,360 --> 00:40:01,639
But that's not going to get Kolya away from Rakitin and tuned into Alyasha.

410
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:12,760
Well, it happens very fast on 643, and it's a funny repeat of what happened with Grushenka two-thirds of the way down on 643.

411
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,039
Kolya says, I'm mean in lots of ways, Karamatsov.

412
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:22,599
And he says, no, you have a good nature, but it's been distorted, and I understand now why you have had such an influence on the sensitive boy.

413
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:23,879
That's Alyusha.

414
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:26,840
Alyasha answered warmly.

415
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,119
You say that to me, cried Kolya.

416
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:29,999
Would you believe it?

417
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:34,479
I thought, I've thought several times since I've been here that you despise me.

418
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,360
If only you knew how much I prized your opinion.

419
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,959
It sounds familiar, doesn't it?

420
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:41,200
Exactly what happened with Grushenko.

421
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:51,920
These people, it's typical Dostoevsky, are insecure and humiliated and misinterpret everybody's gestures toward them as further humiliation.

422
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:59,840
And only somebody who's already completely secure in their love of themselves and of others can sort of break through that.

423
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:04,240
How many did you read in high school, the Notes from Underground?

424
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,160
How many read Notes from Underground?

425
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:07,279
Only one or two.

426
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,559
Because that's all about this.

427
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:21,280
I mean, the underground guy tries to help this woman who feels so despised, the prostitute, but she misinterprets all of his gestures as further insults.

428
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:27,920
And that's a very despairing story because there's nobody there who has the security of Alyasha.

429
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,640
They're both insecure, and they just, they're in hell together.

430
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:46,240
But in this case, it turns out okay because Alyasha has already got the love funneled to him from Markle to Zosima to him.

431
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,439
And now, I think, did I take two pages?

432
00:41:51,439 --> 00:41:51,920
No.

433
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,559
Okay, now we have to turn to Ilusha.

434
00:41:54,559 --> 00:42:04,319
These are all, you don't know yet, but the sort of all those questions I raised are going to be taken up, but they're not taken up until Ilusha dies.

435
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,080
We have to get all the pieces.

436
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:31,159
So Ilusha is this nice boy who is dying of TV, and the boys are all his buddies, and he was full of anger and hatred because his father was humiliated by Dmitry, but now he's becoming, like Markle, warm and loving and open because he's also got brain fever.

437
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:44,920
And he feels this very bad for having done this nasty trick to a dog of putting a pin in the food and then throwing the food to the dog and so forth on 618.

438
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:53,799
And they are trying to, well, they're all moved by him and his love.

439
00:42:54,119 --> 00:43:00,040
And they also are going out trying to find the dog, or claim to find the dog, so he can die happy.

440
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:02,759
But that's a subplot we don't have to worry about.

441
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:07,080
What we have to worry about is what happens actually when he dies.

442
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,600
Now that goes way to the end of the book, A88.

443
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:13,080
All the things happen very fast.

444
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:21,720
He dies, full of love and happy, and he tells everybody how much he loves them.

445
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:29,000
And then, so poor little Ilusha, he died.

446
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:34,280
And the boys were all around him.

447
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,959
And now comes one move you've got to see.

448
00:43:37,959 --> 00:43:43,880
When he died, there was no smell of decay from the corpse, the bottom of A88.

449
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:49,880
I say that because you ought to know what that means.

450
00:43:49,880 --> 00:44:10,240
Books, I've seen books and chapters where smart people, presumably, write about the brothers Karamatsov, trying to figure out what it means that Zosima's body rots and stinks and Alyusha's body is perfectly preserved and doesn't have any odor of decay at all.

451
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:15,519
And they think, well, there must be something better about Alyusha than there is about Zosima.

452
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:16,639
I wonder what it is.

453
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:19,760
And they write articles and presumably get PhDs.

454
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,719
But what's wrong?

455
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:22,959
What's the right way to think about it?

456
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:24,880
You're all better off than these people.

457
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,359
Yes.

458
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,760
No, that's not the right way to think about it.

459
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,720
Try again.

460
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,600
Yeah.

461
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,520
It's what?

462
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:35,680
He's innocent.

463
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,399
Yeah, he's innocent, but that's not the point.

464
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,039
Yes.

465
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,000
That his body was washed after he died.

466
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:47,600
Dostoevsky goes out of his way to tell you it was a cold autumn day and it was snowing.

467
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:49,519
What about flowers?

468
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:50,959
Were there flowers?

469
00:44:50,959 --> 00:44:51,759
Yes, there were.

470
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,000
His body was covered with flowers.

471
00:44:53,999 --> 00:44:59,760
So, and I bet somewhere, I just didn't have time to reread it, that the windows were open.

472
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,999
I have the memory that the windows were open.

473
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,639
If you know where it is, tell me about it.

474
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,439
But notice.

475
00:45:05,439 --> 00:45:06,800
So what's the moral?

476
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,959
Remember with Zosima, there were no flowers.

477
00:45:08,959 --> 00:45:10,319
The body was not washed.

478
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,120
It was a warm autumn evening and the windows were closed.

479
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,319
Here we've got a body that's been washed, that there are lots of flowers.

480
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:20,240
It's a cold autumn evening, and I'm pretty sure the windows are open.

481
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:24,479
Now, what does it show that Kolya's body didn't decompose?

482
00:45:25,439 --> 00:45:26,479
Nothing.

483
00:45:26,479 --> 00:45:27,920
Absolutely nothing.

484
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:41,039
It just shows that the laws of physics go on, and if you're expecting miracles and significance that go against the laws of physics and chemistry, you're looking in the wrong place, according to Dostoevsky.

485
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:51,080
I mean, sure, Ilyusha is pure, but it's not manifest by the fact that his body doesn't decompose, and it doesn't count against Zosima, but his does.

486
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:57,239
It's a neat move that Dostoevsky's just pulling on you, and all of you fell for it.

487
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,600
I fell for it, too.

488
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:04,040
But now we are all one step ahead of all those other people who are still battling over it.

489
00:46:04,039 --> 00:46:05,959
Somebody put a hand up over here?

490
00:46:05,959 --> 00:46:10,199
Okay, well, so now that's even that's not the big issue yet.

491
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,200
I just have to get these issues off the table one at a time.

492
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,720
So let's see.

493
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:18,279
It's only natural, everything is natural.

494
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,240
That's that.

495
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,319
He dies in the cold autumn.

496
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,439
I have 890.

497
00:46:22,439 --> 00:46:24,680
That must be where it says it's cold.

498
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,400
There was a slight frost, it says, at the bottom of 890.

499
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,920
And the room was full of flowers, he says, on 888.

500
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:42,600
There were flowers in his hands, and the coffin at the bottom of 888, inside and out, was decked with flowers and so forth and so forth.

501
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:45,079
So now we settled that.

502
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:50,439
And both of the deaths create a miracle.

503
00:46:50,840 --> 00:47:02,600
Zosima's death sends Alyasha to Grushenka, and the love in Alyasha, and it comes from Zosima, transforms, through Alyasha, transforms Grushenka.

504
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:07,880
Now, Ilusha also produces a miracle, but it's a different kind of miracle.

505
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,800
It's the miracle of the founding of a church.

506
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,000
That's one of the things that we need to find out about.

507
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:16,439
And that's the first of them.

508
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:23,320
What the issue is now, we're going to find out what is an existentialized church community.

509
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:32,640
It looked pretty much what Dostoevsky thinks must have been the original Christian community before it got mixed up with Greek thinking.

510
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:34,160
So here's what happens.

511
00:47:35,439 --> 00:47:46,080
Alicia's death creates the church, answers the question from the Grand Inquisitor, and now, and what is the middle ground between the two?

512
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,959
And how does that happen?

513
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,360
Well, here's what happens.

514
00:47:51,360 --> 00:48:00,560
The boys found a church with Alyasha uses the death of Elusia to found a church.

515
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:09,199
And that happens, and it's sort of almost funny that Dostoevsky again hits you over the head with it.

516
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,920
It's one of my favorite of telling you what he's doing.

517
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,240
First, I'll show you that he's doing it.

518
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,040
Then I'll show you where he shows you that he's doing it.

519
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:21,520
So let's look at 894 at the bottom.

520
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:24,800
Let's make a compact here at Elusia's Stone.

521
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,839
There was this rock that Alicia liked, and they're meeting around the rock.

522
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:32,240
Alicia's funeral was over.

523
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,120
He's dead.

524
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,040
Now the boys are all there.

525
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,920
And now Alyasha makes a big speech.

526
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,959
Let's make a compact here at Alicia's Stone.

527
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,999
And then skipping down.

528
00:48:41,999 --> 00:48:48,080
A compact is a kind of religious commitment.

529
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,079
You can have bad compacts.

530
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:51,679
You can make compacts with the devil.

531
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:55,360
I think you can only make compacts sort of in the dimension of the sacred.

532
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,320
But this is going to be a good compact.

533
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:02,080
Now 10 lines down in 895.

534
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,639
And we will remember him, boys, all our lives.

535
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:16,439
And even if we're occupied with important things, even if we obtain honor or fall into misfortune, still let us remember how good it was once here when we were all together, united by good and kind feelings.

536
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:35,000
So he's telling them that this is a childhood memory, that this is some important event that they will always remember, whose meaning can't be taken back by any other events, misfortunes or successes.

537
00:49:34,999 --> 00:49:38,599
And that's exactly what it's like a baptism.

538
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:45,479
It puts them into this special, religious, and, in a certain sense, eternal dimension.

539
00:49:45,479 --> 00:49:47,320
Why do I say it's eternal?

540
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:53,240
Because it's a moment that isn't up for grabs, for reinterpretation, any other moment.

541
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,920
It's the instant, in Kierkegaard language.

542
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:07,000
Dostoevsky and Kierkegaard share the idea that they are these special moments which determine your way of looking at things for your whole life.

543
00:50:06,999 --> 00:50:10,040
Now, he says it on the middle of 895.

544
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:18,040
He's already shown it with the baptism and the nuts from the old German doctor, but now he says it in general.

545
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:27,880
You must know that there is nothing higher and stronger and more wholesome and good for life in the future than some good memory, especially a memory of childhood, of home.

546
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:36,040
People talk to you a great deal about your education, but some good sacred memory preserved from childhood is perhaps the best education.

547
00:50:36,039 --> 00:50:41,479
If a man carries many such memories with him into life, he is safe to the end of his days.

548
00:50:41,479 --> 00:50:43,800
Well, that's pretty important.

549
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:55,479
That's telling you that there is this special kind of memory which is outside of time and it's eternal.

550
00:50:55,479 --> 00:51:03,840
And remember, the existential word for what is the fancy Greek word for eternal, which is outside of time.

551
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,560
This isn't outside of time.

552
00:51:06,959 --> 00:51:09,680
But this marks the whole time of your life.

553
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:15,200
The past was, you didn't have it yet, and you were lost, and afterwards you have it, and you have it for good.

554
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,200
And the word for it is, anybody know, forever.

555
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,760
Forever is sort of existentialized eternity.

556
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,519
And now you get this happening on 896.

557
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:28,479
We're very near the end.

558
00:51:28,479 --> 00:51:30,799
Dostoevsky is throwing in everything he knows.

559
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,719
Two-thirds of the way down.

560
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,959
You're all dear to me, boys, from this day forth.

561
00:51:34,959 --> 00:51:37,040
I have a place in my heart for you all.

562
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:40,000
And I beg you to keep a place in your heart for me.

563
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:50,800
Well, and who has united us in this good, in this kind, good feeling, which we shall remember and intend to remember all our lives?

564
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:55,040
Who, if not Elusha, the good boy, the dear boy, precious to us forever?

565
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:56,559
Let us never forget him.

566
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:59,280
May his memory live forever in our hearts.

567
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:04,320
Yes, yes, forever, forever, the boys cried in their ringing voices.

568
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:07,600
Now, you've got so many things happening at once.

569
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:16,959
They've been unified together by Elusha, and that's a kind of community, a kind of sacred community.

570
00:52:16,959 --> 00:52:22,639
They don't just each one remember that this nice thing happened with Elusha.

571
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:26,160
They each remember that they were all together in it.

572
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:33,119
That they not only had this common love, but they noticed that they had the common love.

573
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:35,199
And that was part of what was special about it.

574
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,319
That's what they will remember.

575
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:42,000
They will remember that at the death of Elusha, they all were there and they all loved each other.

576
00:52:41,999 --> 00:52:44,439
And that's the middle kind of church.

577
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:52,600
Remember, the Zosima says, where two or more are gathered in my name, that's a world of living love.

578
00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:57,959
They've created a separate forever bond.

579
00:52:57,959 --> 00:53:07,000
They've sort of latched onto the connectedness of everything in their own particular lives forever over the death of Alusha.

580
00:53:06,999 --> 00:53:13,800
And that means, notice that it wouldn't be enough to say if two are united in my name.

581
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:21,880
I mean, that might be the answer to Kierkegaard, who thinks you have to each one relate alone to God, the extreme Protestant story.

582
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:26,600
And it might be the answer to the Roman Catholics that everybody has to be in Christendom.

583
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:31,800
But it takes more than two, because two you could get by a defining commitment.

584
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,400
But Dostoevsky doesn't defining commitments.

585
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:40,119
It's not, I mean, when you've got a defining commitment, it's only for two.

586
00:53:40,119 --> 00:53:48,360
You can't break into the love of the prince and of the lad and the princess or whatever your love is.

587
00:53:48,999 --> 00:53:49,639
You can't.

588
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:56,280
I mean, another example is Lear and Cordelia, where in how many read King Lear and School?

589
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:03,640
They form a little world like birds in a cage, and nothing affects them, and they can listen to what's going on in court.

590
00:54:03,639 --> 00:54:06,360
But there's just the two of them.

591
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:09,479
It's the two or more that's important.

592
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:11,240
That's why it's like a church.

593
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:15,320
That is, it could be two, but it's open to a group.

594
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,280
And in this case, it's open to a group of boys.

595
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:21,319
And now comes the very funniest thing in the book.

596
00:54:21,959 --> 00:54:26,800
If Dostievsky is going to hit you over the head, but he's just founded a church?

597
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:32,159
Well, you might suspect is something like that is going on because they're doing it at Iraq.

598
00:54:32,479 --> 00:54:44,640
Those of you who are the Christians who read the Bible know that the church was founded when Jesus gave Peter the power to save people, and he did it at a rock.

599
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:47,439
But that's not the funny part.

600
00:54:47,439 --> 00:54:49,279
The funny part is elsewhere.

601
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,479
I hope I haven't lost it.

602
00:54:50,479 --> 00:54:51,360
I couldn't.

603
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,560
I could tell you, but I want you to see it in print.

604
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:55,599
Okay, I'll find it.

605
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,760
The bottom of some page.

606
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,319
The question is: maybe you'll find it before me.

607
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,760
How many boys are there?

608
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,959
Why would we care?

609
00:55:02,959 --> 00:55:05,039
Why would Dostoevsky tell us how many boys?

610
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:07,360
Here they are at the bottom of 887.

611
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,359
Again, you have to be a Christian to get it.

612
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:13,760
At the bottom, they had all been expecting him and were glad he had come at last.

613
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,519
There were about 12 of them.

614
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:17,280
Bong.

615
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,959
How in the world Dostoevsky can do that sort of thing?

616
00:55:20,959 --> 00:55:25,360
There were 12 apostles at the rock when Peter founded the church.

617
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:31,200
And he's telling you, here's the existentialized version of it, and don't, I'm not going to let you miss it.

618
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,159
Okay, so there they are at Alicia's Stone.

619
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:35,760
I'm just catching up.

620
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:43,039
There's a group sharing a special moment, and they chant.

621
00:55:43,439 --> 00:55:44,400
I read that already.

622
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:50,320
It's a kind of chant that they have where they say forever, and then they go back to saying forever.

623
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:55,200
And the boys cried in their ringing voices.

624
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:02,239
Now, we have to see what is the relation of the forever to eternity.

625
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:06,239
Well, I've said it's already the eternity in time that Kierkegaard talks about.

626
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,920
It's something that's going to be meaningful for your whole life.

627
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,920
But that's not immortality.

628
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,920
Now we want to know about the afterlife.

629
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,520
This one is really tough.

630
00:56:16,519 --> 00:56:20,680
I mean, how is Dostoevsky going to existentialize the afterlife?

631
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:24,839
After all, nobody knows what happens after you die.

632
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,920
And Dostoevsky doesn't know either.

633
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:34,040
And he's not going to just be able to, you know, give you a direct answer and say, well, you do live forever in another world.

634
00:56:34,039 --> 00:56:39,720
And he's not going to be able to say, well, you don't, because there's no place for that in physics and chemistry.

635
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,880
He doesn't care about physics and chemistry.

636
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:47,560
Whatever goes on after you die is not going to be settled by knowing about your neurons.

637
00:56:47,559 --> 00:56:49,959
So, well, he does a weird thing.

638
00:56:49,959 --> 00:56:57,959
I can't say that I'm absolutely convinced, but I'm trying to convince you that his problem is so hard that you don't know what to say.

639
00:56:57,959 --> 00:57:02,200
Well, here's what he says at the top of 897.

640
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:11,799
And the boy, and then it made the boy's memory, I'm about five lines, dear boy's memory live forever, Alyasha added again and again.

641
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,639
Forever, the boys chimed in again.

642
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:16,439
This is the sort of church chant part.

643
00:57:16,439 --> 00:57:18,360
Karamatsov cried Kolya.

644
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:26,920
Can it be true, as they teach us in church, that we shall all rise again from the dead and live and see each other again, all Ilusha too?

645
00:57:27,159 --> 00:57:29,640
So there's Kolya doing the right thing.

646
00:57:29,639 --> 00:57:43,079
He's sort of pushing Alyasha to give him the answer to this question that's tormented, you know, as I say, everybody in the book, really, but particularly old Taramatsov and Madame Holokov.

647
00:57:43,079 --> 00:57:44,439
Well, what is the answer?

648
00:57:44,439 --> 00:57:46,280
Well, it's a weird answer.

649
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,119
Certainly we shall all rise again.

650
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:49,519
Certainly we shall see each other.

651
00:57:49,519 --> 00:57:52,760
And she'll tell each other with joy and gladness all that happened.

652
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:57,400
Alyasha answered, half laughing, half enthusiastic.

653
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:01,439
Now, I don't quite know what to say about that.

654
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:06,639
I mean, surely he's not telling them that he knows for sure that they're all going to die.

655
00:58:06,639 --> 00:58:08,159
When they die, they're going to see each other again.

656
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:09,439
It's Assimus Shore.

657
00:58:09,439 --> 00:58:20,320
He tells the woman whose son has died that your son is sitting up with God looking at you and don't leave your husband because your son would be unhappy and all that early on in the book.

658
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:26,479
Sir, but there isn't any heaven in that sense or any God in that sense in Dostoevsky.

659
00:58:26,479 --> 00:58:33,920
So what's, well, I think what he says, what he's saying is that why do you need to know?

660
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:40,080
I've told you everything that we know that I can tell you about eternity and immortality.

661
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:50,640
Namely, that this memory is basic and it'll save you and you'll never lose it and you'll always be together in it and so forth.

662
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:52,800
And that's the enthusiastic.

663
00:58:52,800 --> 00:59:02,479
And then sort of laughing because he's saying in a way, well, I told you all that we could possibly know and what more do you want?

664
00:59:02,479 --> 00:59:05,040
And he's sort of shrugging off the question.

665
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:12,240
And what happens next is that he tells them, let's go eat pancakes.

666
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,599
He laughs half, oh, how wonderful it will be, cried Kolya.

667
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,559
Well, now we are finished talking and we could go to the funeral dinner.

668
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,320
Don't be disturbed at our eating pancakes.

669
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:23,599
It's an old custom and there's something nice in it, laughed Alyasha.

670
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:24,479
Let's go.

671
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:32,479
So in a certain way, this very serious question, which he understands is a very serious question.

672
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:36,479
He doesn't really have a serious answer.

673
00:59:36,479 --> 00:59:46,759
He goes as far as he can, and then he just sort of says, I've told you enough that you can lead a meaningful life and you can found a church and so forth.

674
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:48,600
And that's it.

675
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:51,080
So now where am I?

676
00:59:52,039 --> 00:59:53,799
I'm very near the end.

677
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:54,999
Let's see those questions.

678
00:59:54,999 --> 00:59:58,040
Have I answered all the questions I told you we had to answer?

679
00:59:58,039 --> 01:00:00,120
The founding of a church, yes.

680
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:02,840
What kind of community that is, and how you get it.

681
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:05,559
The answer to immortality, yes.

682
01:00:06,039 --> 01:00:09,320
Insofar as he can answer it at all, he answers it.

683
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,560
Well, we still have two more to go.

684
01:00:11,559 --> 01:00:14,600
What's the meaning of being a Karamatsov?

685
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:20,599
And that's a weird and wonderful tour, of course, which he doesn't, which is easy to see and understand.

686
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,400
All through, remember, we're all Karamatsovs.

687
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:27,320
Karamatsovs are the sort of paradigm human beings.

688
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:31,240
Then they've all got a self with a dark side and a bright side.

689
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:35,159
And now, what's going to become of the Karamatsov?

690
01:00:35,159 --> 01:00:39,959
On 248, all through the book, people give their opinion about what it is to be.

691
01:00:40,439 --> 01:00:42,760
Starting on 248, 248?

692
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:43,959
248.

693
01:00:43,959 --> 01:00:45,159
Oh, I'm not on 248.

694
01:00:45,159 --> 01:00:45,959
There we are.

695
01:00:45,959 --> 01:01:00,920
At the bottom of 248, the first view you get is the dim view, namely that we are contradictory selves with good and bad impulses, and it's a primitive force, about 10 lines from the bottom.

696
01:01:00,999 --> 01:01:06,119
It's the primitive force of the Karamatsovs, as Father Piasi said the other day, a crude.

697
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:12,120
This is not too complimentary about us all, Karamatsovs, a crude, unbridled, earthly force.

698
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:15,320
Does the Spirit of God move above that force?

699
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,920
Even that I don't know.

700
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:20,199
I only know I'm a Karamatsov.

701
01:01:20,439 --> 01:01:21,879
He's talking to Lisa.

702
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:32,640
And he's admitting, humblingly admitting, his lackey, primitive, what does he call it, lots of bad things, crude, earthy side.

703
01:01:33,999 --> 01:01:36,559
But that's not the last word on the Karamatsov.

704
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:39,120
There's kick way back now.

705
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:43,680
The whole issue comes back on page 810 at court.

706
01:01:44,479 --> 01:01:51,839
In the courtroom, the lawyer is explaining, and he's giving you Rakitin's view of what it is to be a Karamatsov.

707
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,160
The middle of the second paragraph.

708
01:01:54,159 --> 01:01:56,879
Because he was, they're talking about Dmitri.

709
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:59,439
And remember, he's the broadest Karamatsov.

710
01:01:59,439 --> 01:02:03,840
When we saw him come into the book, he had all those contradictions.

711
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:05,840
And he said the self is too broad.

712
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:07,280
He has it narrower.

713
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:11,519
And now, but the broadness is just what's at stake.

714
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:14,319
I mean, the Karamatsov self is broad.

715
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:20,560
It reaches all the way from the earthly to the heavenly, from the bad to the good, from the sensual to the spiritual.

716
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:30,000
So because he was of the broad Karamatsov character, that's just what I'm leading up to, capable of combining the most incongruous contradictions.

717
01:02:29,999 --> 01:02:32,240
Yep, the self is contradictory.

718
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,959
And capable of the greatest heights and the greatest depths.

719
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:40,240
Remember, he goes headfirst into the pit and singing a song to the Madonna.

720
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:45,679
Remember the brilliant remark made by a young observer who was seeing the Karamatsov family at close quarters, Mr.

721
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,880
Rakitin.

722
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:53,280
Now, you can expect Rakitin to be accurate, but not sympathetic.

723
01:02:53,280 --> 01:03:01,680
He says the sense of their own degradation is as essential to these reckless, unbridled natures as the sense of their generosity, unquote.

724
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,199
And that's true, the lawyer says.

725
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:12,879
They need continually this unnatural mixture, two extremes at the same moment, or they are miserable and dissatisfied with their existence, and their existence is incomplete.

726
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,999
They are wide, wide as Mother Russia.

727
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:17,400
They include everything and put up with everything.

728
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:20,359
Well, that's a big extreme statement.

729
01:03:20,999 --> 01:03:25,479
So now it's not so much that the Keren Matsovs are bad and crude or everything.

730
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,079
They're just too broad.

731
01:03:27,079 --> 01:03:29,160
They combine everything.

732
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:44,840
And what's left out of this whole story is something like how do they, could they get the contradictions together so as to make one unified, happy self?

733
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:53,800
And the answer is not on their own, not just quad natural human beings, but of course through agape love.

734
01:03:53,800 --> 01:04:04,679
They get transformed so that Dmitry isn't anymore considered base and sensual, but rather impulsive, but positive.

735
01:04:04,999 --> 01:04:09,159
What was once, what's really going on is really kind of interesting and subtle.

736
01:04:09,159 --> 01:04:43,479
What Dostoevsky is saying is, and I was trying to set it up at the beginning of the lecture with talking about the impulsiveness you have to have if you're going to express your love, that what looks like the dark, earthy, primitive, sensual, crude side of the self, is the same aspect of the self that gives it the impulsiveness and the recklessness to do the best things that people do, like jump on the railroad tracks on top of somebody else and hold them down while the train goes over.

737
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:52,679
I mean, that kind of connected impulsiveness is part of the Keren Matsov force.

738
01:04:52,999 --> 01:05:01,840
And so, in the end, and remember that when you name the two parts of the self, you already set up how you're going to view the self.

739
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:08,160
So, if you think the two parts are noble and lackey, you're not going to be able to get them together.

740
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:18,640
If you think that they're just plain, which is Ivan, if you think that they're Sodom and Madonna, you're not going to get them together.

741
01:05:18,639 --> 01:05:27,280
But you can get them together if you think of them as, or if you think of them as the sensual and spiritual, even that doesn't work.

742
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:34,800
But you've got to think of them as the earthy, and that's partly the impulsive, but also the sensual.

743
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:40,320
But the earthly and the heavenly, those don't need to be opposed.

744
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:43,760
But finally, in somebody like Dmitri, they come together.

745
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:48,720
Presumably, Alyasha hasn't made it yet, but they will come together.

746
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:51,360
It's not clear with Zosim that occurs to me.

747
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:55,360
I think he's got rid too much of the sensual and the impulsive.

748
01:05:55,360 --> 01:06:08,560
He's got the love, but the ideal Karamatsov is recklessly doing good, loving people.

749
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:11,599
588 is what I say as keyport.

750
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:14,880
That's one of the places where we hear the word reckless.

751
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:22,719
Remember, I read it at the very beginning today, where he feels, Dmitri feels that he has to do something to help everybody suffering.

752
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:31,199
At the end of the paragraph, he wanted to do all this at once, regardless of obstacles, with the recklessness of the Karamatsa's.

753
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:40,640
So, as I'm talking, I'm trying to gradually, what the book does, work you around from a negative view of the Taramatsov, Father Piases.

754
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:55,399
It's a boob force, it's a very dangerous thing, that it can be a positive thing, that the sensual side can be the impulsive side and the loving side, and then you get a positive view of the Karamatsa.

755
01:06:56,039 --> 01:06:59,479
And that's the saving thing.

756
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:08,039
The earthly sensual can be combined with the heavenly spiritual if you experience agape love.

757
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:11,720
That's the Dostoevsky view.

758
01:07:12,039 --> 01:07:15,959
And that is in a certain sense the end of the book.

759
01:07:15,959 --> 01:07:18,519
But it's done in a weird and wonderful way.

760
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,999
Okay, we're now, he's done it in the last paragraph.

761
01:07:20,999 --> 01:07:26,760
But I want to make sure that I convinced you that everyone of that, he's done all the jobs I listed.

762
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:27,479
He has to do.

763
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:31,159
Okay, he's now telling us the meaning of being a Karamatsov.

764
01:07:31,159 --> 01:07:33,319
That it's a positive good thing.

765
01:07:33,319 --> 01:07:43,880
We're all Karamatsavs, and when we get ourselves together in the right way, we will be loving, impulsive, sensual, spiritual, and so forth.

766
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:48,119
And now, what do the boys say in the last paragraph?

767
01:07:48,119 --> 01:07:56,599
They say, and all our, yeah, and all our lives hand in hand, hooray for Karamatsa.

768
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:09,239
That's in a certain way the most important line in the book: that there is a way that the self, contradictory as it is, can, by this love that flows into the world and connectedness, become something positive.

769
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,439
So, hooray for Karamatsov, Kalya cried once more.

770
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:16,679
And once more, the boys took up the cry: Hooray for Karamatsov.

771
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:19,720
Now, you might well think that that's a good ending.

772
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:26,999
The brothers Karamatsov, we've gone from bad to worse, but the translation is wrong.

773
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:33,439
In the Russian, I've checked it, there is that last sentence, hooray for Karamatsov, isn't there.

774
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:35,999
Now, why isn't it there?

775
01:08:35,999 --> 01:08:38,959
Well, there's one thing I haven't answered yet.

776
01:08:38,959 --> 01:08:42,479
How is the Christianity going to go out and save the world?

777
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,880
How is the star going to rise in the East?

778
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,920
It's not going to be by Hooray for Karamatsov.

779
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:52,639
The last line is really, and the boys took up his cry.

780
01:08:52,640 --> 01:09:06,319
That is, the last thing in the book has to be the boys charging out into the world, now completely strong because they formed this church, now transformed into good Karamatsovs through this love.

781
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:31,119
And that's the beginning of, I think you're supposed to think, each of them is going to go their own way, and each of these boys is going to found a church around some other loving person, some other martyr, some other death or something, and the world is going to become colonized by more and more colonies of these kind of communities.

782
01:09:31,119 --> 01:09:44,479
And then Dostoevsky sort of dream, someday those communities will just be everywhere and take over the earth, and then that will be heaven on earth here and now, as Markle says.

783
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:49,359
I mean, that's the sort of wild vision that's behind it all.

784
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:51,999
And that's it for the book.

785
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:52,959
We did it.

786
01:09:52,959 --> 01:09:53,999
Yep, we did it.

787
01:09:53,999 --> 01:09:59,359
Anybody, there's time, five minutes, for anybody to have a last word here if you want to.

788
01:09:59,359 --> 01:10:00,319
Anybody?

789
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:09,119
Okay, well, go home and write good papers and uh and and and read read the assignment for Tuesday if you possibly can.

790
01:10:09,119 --> 01:10:10,560
We're going to switch to Nietzsche.
