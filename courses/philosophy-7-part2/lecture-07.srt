1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,921
Okay, now I'm ready to talk about Hiroshima Monomur, which is, I hope you enjoyed it, if that's the right word, sort of taken up by it, overwhelmed by it.

2
00:00:11,921 --> 00:00:17,760
It's so hard and so deep and so dense and so utterly Kierkegaardian.

3
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:19,840
I trust you did see that.

4
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:22,080
We'll see as we discuss it.

5
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:28,921
It's so Kierkegaardian that I feel pretty sure that Marguerite Duras must have read Fear and Trembling.

6
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:29,561
Why not?

7
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:31,960
Everybody reads Fear and Trembling.

8
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:33,800
She's a French intellectual.

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:41,321
But if anybody happens to ever come across anything which tells them that she's read it, I would love to know.

10
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:42,840
Be sure and tell me.

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:01:01,400
I sort of hope she hasn't read it, because I'd rather think that if anybody thinks about these issues, they come to this conclusion because this is the way the phenomenon goes, and that the fact that it's exact in agreement with Fear and Trembling should be sort of evidence for fear and trembling rather than evidence for the influence of fear and trembling.

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,400
But it would be nice just to know.

13
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,560
Okay, let's start.

14
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:16,840
It starts in a way the sort of cleverness and deepness of which only becomes evident much, much later in the movie.

15
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:23,960
In fact, it starts purposely, completely misleading you about what's going on.

16
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:34,761
First, there's this ambiguous picture of the lovers, and according to the scenario, they're supposed to be covered by dust from the atomic bomb and perspiration from making love.

17
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,360
I mean, I don't know if that comes across.

18
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,761
It doesn't come across to me particularly, but if it does, then so much the better.

19
00:01:40,761 --> 00:01:43,560
But their voices come across clearly.

20
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,120
Obviously, it's not what they're saying to each other.

21
00:01:46,121 --> 00:01:56,520
You could hardly want to carry on such a flat and detached conversation while making love, but it's what they're thinking, I presume.

22
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,641
And what they're thinking is, and now we get to the text.

23
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:03,481
I'll read a lot from the text because how else can you tell what's going on?

24
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,040
In the movie, it goes by so fast.

25
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,841
So it begins.

26
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,800
This is the very beginning, two sentences.

27
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:19,761
And those two sentences are going to come back again and again, literally or sort of in the background, till the very last words of the movie.

28
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,080
He says, you saw nothing in Hiroshima, nothing.

29
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,160
And she says, I saw everything, everything.

30
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:36,321
And then they go through all kinds of variations on that, which I won't go through all of, but at least a few more.

31
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:41,441
So she says, listen, I know, I know everything.

32
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:43,040
And he says, nothing.

33
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,561
You know nothing.

34
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:53,120
And then more important, because the issue in the movie is about forgetting, she says, listen to me.

35
00:02:53,441 --> 00:02:55,761
Like you, I know what it is to forget.

36
00:02:55,761 --> 00:02:58,240
No, you don't know what it is to forget.

37
00:02:58,241 --> 00:02:59,761
Like you, I have a memory.

38
00:02:59,761 --> 00:03:01,201
I know what it is to forget.

39
00:03:01,201 --> 00:03:03,120
No, you don't have a memory.

40
00:03:03,121 --> 00:03:06,080
Like you, I tried with all my might not to forget.

41
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,441
Like you, I forgot.

42
00:03:07,441 --> 00:03:12,561
Like you, I wanted to have an inconsolable memory, a memory of shadows and stone.

43
00:03:12,561 --> 00:03:22,400
And he doesn't say, no, not like me, but he could, because he denies everything, she says, during that first theme.

44
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,481
And how do you naturally take that first theme?

45
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,840
Anybody want to say?

46
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,201
I mean, I think everybody must have the same reaction when they see it.

47
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:32,400
They're supposed to.

48
00:03:33,441 --> 00:03:37,681
Who's right about, did she understand it?

49
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,401
Did she see it?

50
00:03:39,681 --> 00:03:40,801
Or not?

51
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:47,840
Well, here, let me give you another clue to how I think you're supposed to understand it, which I skipped because it was sort of an obvious one.

52
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,641
She says, I've always wept over the fate of Hiroshima.

53
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:52,561
Always.

54
00:03:52,561 --> 00:03:56,201
He, no, what would you have to cry about?

55
00:03:55,761 --> 00:03:58,201
Now, what does that say?

56
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:08,681
Here's this tourist from France in bed with this Japanese man in Hiroshima, and she's telling him she always wept over the fate of Hiroshima.

57
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:13,240
And he's saying, What would you have cried about?

58
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:14,281
So, what's going on?

59
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,321
It's sort of obvious.

60
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,921
I'm not trying to be subtle, but you're supposed to have an immediate reaction to it.

61
00:04:21,321 --> 00:04:24,040
Somebody say, That's what she feels.

62
00:04:24,121 --> 00:04:26,121
Well, no, more extreme than that.

63
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:28,361
He's telling her she can't understand anything.

64
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:29,881
She hasn't seen anything.

65
00:04:29,881 --> 00:04:31,881
She's had nothing to weep about.

66
00:04:31,881 --> 00:04:33,881
What right does he have to tell her that?

67
00:04:33,881 --> 00:04:35,480
What does he mean?

68
00:04:36,121 --> 00:04:37,720
She wasn't there.

69
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:42,921
He's been through one of the greatest disasters maybe in the history of the world.

70
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,561
I don't know how many thousand people killed in a few, in a minute or two.

71
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:59,001
Anyway, in a huge disaster, which it turns out later his family was at, meaning his mother, his father, his siblings, his wife, if he had one, and his kids, if he had one, was some.

72
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:06,441
Interestingly enough, we don't know, and he doesn't bother to tell her how many there were or where they were killed or anything like that.

73
00:05:06,441 --> 00:05:14,041
But he's been through this great big disaster, and she's coming as a tourist making a movie, and she's saying, I've seen it all.

74
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,721
And he says, no, you haven't seen anything.

75
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,321
And she says, I've understood it all.

76
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:19,561
And he says, no, you haven't understood anything.

77
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:24,441
And it gets clearest when she said, I really wept over all what happened to you guys in Hiroshima.

78
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:26,921
And he says, why were you crying about?

79
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,520
Compared, of course, to what he's been through.

80
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:40,921
The disaster was so terrible that uh uh she's bound to misunderstand it, n bound not to be able to grasp it.

81
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:48,480
And s he I just want to go through the place where he says that he's lost everybody, but he says it so fast that you hardly notice.

82
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:49,681
And that's important.

83
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:52,400
It's as if he hardly notices.

84
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,120
He says, Is that where I want to be?

85
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,041
Wait a minute, I'm sure I am where I want to be.

86
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,761
I'm 28.

87
00:05:59,761 --> 00:06:00,800
You guys he lost.

88
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,720
Oh, yeah, okay, that's what I want.

89
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,680
Okay, I'm 28.

90
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:08,960
I'll give you the pages in the scenarios I read things, so in case you want to go back and read them, you can.

91
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,600
She says, you were here at Hiroshima?

92
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:12,960
He laughing.

93
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,960
No, of course I wasn't.

94
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,561
She, that's true.

95
00:06:16,561 --> 00:06:18,080
How stupid of me.

96
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,120
But my family, he says, but my family was at Hiroshima.

97
00:06:21,121 --> 00:06:23,120
I was off fighting the war.

98
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:25,761
And she, a stroke of luck, eh?

99
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:31,761
And he, weighing the pros and cons, after some hesitation, yes.

100
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:38,801
Meaning that, it turns out, he wanted to die having lost everybody, and but he didn't.

101
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:45,360
Exactly similar thing, let's admit it now, that happened to her.

102
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:47,361
But of course, he doesn't know that.

103
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:54,160
For him, at this point, still, she's just a French movie actress that happens to be there.

104
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:01,681
So and it's true that if he had lost all those and she had lost nothing, she wouldn't have been able to understand.

105
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:08,561
But it turns out she had an exactly equal world-destroying disaster.

106
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:22,161
Although they didn't blow up all of Nefu Never, from her point of view, everything she cared about in her world and made her life meaningful was destroyed when her German lover was killed.

107
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:31,001
And just as everything presumably that he cared about was destroyed when Hiroshima was totally wiped off the face of the earth.

108
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:39,801
And you have trouble realizing that, although not much trouble after you see the movie a few times and begin to collect your wits.

109
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:46,761
But the translation in a certain place does everything it can to confuse you.

110
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:50,041
It's hardly to be called a translation.

111
00:07:50,361 --> 00:07:58,121
On page 13, the final words of the introducer, whoever that is, I don't think we're ever told who it is.

112
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:11,401
Somebody who's writing a synopsis anyway says, in this translation, it says, at the end, they name places, names that are not names.

113
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,040
And this is really French fancy talk, what John Searle, my colleague, calls frog fog.

114
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,920
I mean, it's all very, they name places, names that are not names, and then goes on.

115
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:27,241
It is as though through them, all of Hiroshima was in love with all of Never.

116
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,201
She says to him, Hiroshima, that's your name.

117
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,001
That has nothing to do with what happens at the end.

118
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:35,241
By the end of today, you will see.

119
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:38,920
But already, it has nothing to do with what it says in the French.

120
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,121
It's not a translation.

121
00:08:40,121 --> 00:08:41,881
It's a sort of a hallucination.

122
00:08:42,761 --> 00:08:55,001
The translation says the disaster of the woman head-shaved in Never and the disaster of Hiroshima correspond exactly, which is the right thing to say.

123
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:16,641
I don't know where the translation got this, but you're meant to see that she has seen and understood and experienced exactly what he has understood and experienced insofar as, and only insofar as, they both experienced world-destroying disasters.

124
00:09:16,961 --> 00:09:26,241
Now, they certainly haven't had the same experience in the sense of how they came out of it, what kind of people they became afterward.

125
00:09:26,241 --> 00:09:27,761
That's the whole movie.

126
00:09:27,761 --> 00:09:30,961
But they started out in the same place.

127
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:38,961
And then now we need a kind of story about world-destroying disasters and about worlds.

128
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:53,761
I misunderstood this movie for about the first ten years, and it led many, many gullible undergraduates to confusion, I imagine, if they were sensitive.

129
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:56,560
Because I thought, well, let's start.

130
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,401
What is the first level of reaction to world-destroying disaster?

131
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,560
Well, it's nature.

132
00:10:04,881 --> 00:10:12,001
And nature, which is the vegetation around the town, doesn't have much of a problem.

133
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:13,121
It comes back.

134
00:10:13,121 --> 00:10:19,121
In fact, it comes back even more healthy and happy than it was before on page 19.

135
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,720
On the 15th day, Hiroshima was blanketed with flowers.

136
00:10:22,721 --> 00:10:26,001
There were cornflowers and blah, blah, blah, lots of flowers.

137
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:32,321
And they rose again from the ashes with extraordinary vigor, quite unheard of for flowers till then.

138
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,241
By the way, that's a kind of mystery to me.

139
00:10:34,241 --> 00:10:35,360
They're loose ends.

140
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:38,641
Nobody has a totally complete interpretation.

141
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:41,920
I would have thought the flowers ought to come back just the way they left.

142
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,241
I mean, oblivious to this kind of world-destroying event.

143
00:10:46,241 --> 00:10:49,520
Flowers don't have worlds and they don't have world-destroying events.

144
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,161
And why they got sort of pepped up by it, I don't know.

145
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,680
But yeah, I wonder.

146
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,721
I mean, perhaps, maybe that's a true story.

147
00:10:56,321 --> 00:11:01,641
I mean, if it was a true story, that would explain it.

148
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:07,161
Maybe they do get sort of radiated into a better form of life.

149
00:11:07,481 --> 00:11:12,520
And the fish, too, it turns out, get radiated into a better form of life.

150
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,201
That was on 19.

151
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:24,761
On 24, he says that the fish regularly came back rich with gray and blue, depending on the hour and so forth.

152
00:11:24,761 --> 00:11:29,961
And so the fish were back in plenty and the vegetation.

153
00:11:29,961 --> 00:11:33,961
Then he says new vegetation will arise from the sand and so forth.

154
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:35,881
But it's nature anyway.

155
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:43,800
Nature unperturbed, to say the least, and that's all I need to make the point I want by the disaster.

156
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,520
Yeah.

157
00:11:44,841 --> 00:11:46,441
Yes, that's true too.

158
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,161
But they had to throw away the first batches of fish.

159
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:59,401
But finally, the fish kept coming, and after the radioactive ones were thrown away, apparently there was plenty of fish.

160
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:12,841
The problem really is that the question we're going to keep asking yourself in the back of your mind, and what about the town or the city or the city of Hiroshima?

161
00:12:12,841 --> 00:12:15,961
Is it also like nature?

162
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,961
Well, I certainly thought so.

163
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,641
That's my 10-year mistake, or maybe more.

164
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,961
I didn't count how long I was wrong because I didn't know I was wrong.

165
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:38,841
And because you get sort of fooled by the fact that they have this conversation about how Hiroshima is brighter and more busy than ever, and she loves cities that are bright all night and active all night.

166
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:46,241
And I thought, aha, well, nature and objects like cities, they just bounce back.

167
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:51,121
And for some odd reason, they bounce back even more peppy than they were before.

168
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,601
But so we don't know yet if Hiroshima really is part of like the vegetables.

169
00:12:58,081 --> 00:12:58,641
And what is it?

170
00:12:58,721 --> 00:13:02,400
It's all about lower natures in Kierkegaard language.

171
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:21,841
You recognize Fear and Trembling talk in What I'm Saying, I hope, on 72, where he says about two-thirds of the way down, deeper natures never forget themselves and become something other than they were, so the night will remember everything, but lower natures forget themselves and become something new.

172
00:13:21,841 --> 00:13:25,681
Thus, the butterfly has altogether forgotten that it was a caterpillar.

173
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,041
Perhaps it can so completely forget in turn that it was a butterfly that can become a fish.

174
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:40,400
I mean, I have the wild idea that Kierkegaard thinks too, like Marguerite Durvas, somehow, that nature gets better and better.

175
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,641
Caterpillars become butterflies.

176
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:48,160
And I don't know about butterflies becoming fishes, but the fact that she goes right from vegetables to fishes.

177
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,441
I mean, these are tiny signs, maybe, that this book is in the back of her mind.

178
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,361
I don't know, and we don't care.

179
00:13:55,361 --> 00:14:02,641
What we care about is that the lower natures just forget what's going on and just keep doing their thing.

180
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:05,361
And that's the first thing.

181
00:14:05,361 --> 00:14:08,241
But people aren't part of nature.

182
00:14:08,241 --> 00:14:14,881
And so we get to the next level: the mediated beings like us.

183
00:14:14,881 --> 00:14:21,841
And the person who most sort of mediates and meditates and thinks about all this, who is that?

184
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,961
I mean, you guys must have been sort of hit over the head by the movie.

185
00:14:24,961 --> 00:14:27,400
I understand, but not so completely.

186
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,601
Who?

187
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,041
I couldn't hear you.

188
00:14:26,481 --> 00:14:31,641
The girl, the French woman.

189
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:41,081
Yes, the French woman, of course, she's constantly talking about what happened and what Hiroshima is like and what she understands and what she sees and what she felt.

190
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,881
And the Japanese man is just silent.

191
00:14:43,881 --> 00:14:49,080
He never talks about what happened before or what's happening then.

192
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:55,001
It's just not something that he mediates and reflects.

193
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:56,761
He doesn't reflect on it.

194
00:14:56,761 --> 00:14:58,440
Whatever he does, it's something different.

195
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,321
We'll get to that.

196
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,561
But she's reflecting on it all the time.

197
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:11,081
And there is now in her a kind of struggle between the part of her that wants to remember, we've got to think about her disaster now.

198
00:15:11,081 --> 00:15:25,001
The part of her that wants to remember her disaster, the death of her German lover, resists the part of her that's a part of nature, which would, in general, just forget and go on.

199
00:15:25,001 --> 00:15:27,400
Now, this is a Marguerite Diracim.

200
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,601
It has nothing to do anywhere in Kierkegaard, but it's nice.

201
00:15:31,081 --> 00:15:48,361
What you get in her is a kind of attempt to be in eternity, which is her madness, and to get out of nature, which is out of temporality, that low, immediate temporality, just sort of one thing after another.

202
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:59,240
So, something that Kierkegaard wouldn't mention that is interesting to the movie is that she says on page 98 that her hair grows back.

203
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:14,081
Then she says that she got over her madness in the spring, that she suddenly says she has children, sort of knocks them over because she hasn't really mentioned that she's even got a husband or anything, or a wife.

204
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:23,680
And she constantly is resisting all this sort of natural change that's trying to drag her down into lower immediacy.

205
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,000
So on 23, this is happening.

206
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,001
She says, she says to him, like you, I have a memory.

207
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,520
I know what it is to forget.

208
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:33,601
He says, no, you don't have a memory.

209
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:40,160
We won't know for a long time why he says that, because she seems to be totally obsessed with this memory.

210
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,321
She dreams about the German.

211
00:16:43,601 --> 00:17:03,041
That moment that goes by so fast when she sees the Japanese man's hand on the bed and she sees instead the hand of the dying German lover, or, of course, the whole time when she thinks that the French guy is her German lover because he's gotten her drunk and taken over the role of that.

212
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,801
So she's constantly remembering.

213
00:17:04,801 --> 00:17:07,121
And he says, no, you don't have a memory.

214
00:17:07,121 --> 00:17:09,281
And we have to see whether he has.

215
00:17:09,281 --> 00:17:10,480
We don't know that.

216
00:17:10,641 --> 00:17:14,800
So she, like you, I too have tried with all my might not to forget.

217
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,081
Like you, I forgot.

218
00:17:16,081 --> 00:17:21,440
Like you, I wanted to have an inconsolable memory, a memory of shadows and stones.

219
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:27,520
See the photograph by the light of the bicycle on the stone at that point.

220
00:17:27,521 --> 00:17:35,121
She says, for my part, I struggled with all my might every day against the horror of no longer understanding at all the reason for remembering.

221
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:36,881
Like you, I forgot.

222
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:44,080
Well, she's telling him a whole lot of things of the Japanese soldier, which in fact turn out to be false, every bit of them.

223
00:17:44,081 --> 00:17:45,680
But she doesn't know any better.

224
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:51,040
She's just projecting on him correctly what she's been doing.

225
00:17:51,041 --> 00:18:06,920
And what she's been doing is trying to preserve eternity in time in her way to preserve this ideal love and to keep, if it means going mad, she'll go mad, and she did for a while to stay in eternity.

226
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:14,760
But then when spring came, more of nature, then the sun came and it got warm in the cellar, and she came out of eternity.

227
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:21,400
But she's still using all of her energy to preserve the memory of the German lover.

228
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,841
This gets clearer and clearer, but it's clear already.

229
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:28,281
She wants to be in mediation.

230
00:18:28,281 --> 00:18:42,361
She wants to be in some kind of ideal memory of the meaning, of the meaning of the love that she had and lost.

231
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:45,080
And she wants that memory in stone.

232
00:18:45,081 --> 00:18:49,400
So when I say madness and eternity, I'll just give you the pages.

233
00:18:49,400 --> 00:19:01,480
So she says, she was in eternity, and she says, I don't remember how, after they put her in the cellar, she says, I don't remember anymore how long.

234
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,920
He says, how long?

235
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,000
She says, eternity.

236
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,920
And that's really what it was like for her.

237
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:12,280
She was like crazy.

238
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:15,000
She says, what pain, what pain in my heart?

239
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,280
It's unbelievable.

240
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,761
Oh, and yeah, that's more pain.

241
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,641
This is interesting.

242
00:19:20,281 --> 00:19:21,160
Subplot.

243
00:19:22,121 --> 00:19:29,641
She's suffering not only because she lost the German, but because everybody is happy, because it's the end of the war in France.

244
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:37,321
And she's the only one unhappy because her lover is dead, and moreover, he was a German, and now she's having her hair cut, and her father's being humiliated.

245
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:38,841
Everything bad is happening.

246
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:45,200
And she's so miserable, and everybody else is so happy, and this makes her bitter.

247
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:48,240
And this, so she spits in the face of her mother.

248
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:52,080
Do you remember what the Japanese man says about that?

249
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,560
It's one of those moments when you know that he also went through this kind of thing.

250
00:19:56,801 --> 00:20:12,160
She says, I can't just turn to it, I don't think, but she says, and I was they were all happy, and I was in pain, and he says, and your mother comes to you, and you spit in your mother's face.

251
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,601
And she says, yes, of course, of course, you would know.

252
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:26,320
And he says, it was a beautiful day in France when they dropped the bomb on Hiroshima, and everybody in France was celebrating when Hiroshima was killed.

253
00:20:26,321 --> 00:20:27,521
Everything is parallel.

254
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:33,200
That's what the right translation of the beginning of the comment says.

255
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,521
Yeah.

256
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:36,881
I know what you're talking about, about her time.

257
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:39,361
Okay, good.

258
00:20:39,361 --> 00:20:44,960
I mean that she, it's going to get clearer, but I'll try to be clear as I can at this point.

259
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:53,920
She wants to preserve the memory of this perfect love, remembers the moment when she cries, it was my first love, and he slaps her.

260
00:20:53,920 --> 00:21:01,361
I mean, she is so into this, feeling sorry for herself and feeling that this was this perfect story.

261
00:21:01,841 --> 00:21:05,601
And remember, she's never told anybody the story, not even her own husband.

262
00:21:05,601 --> 00:21:09,920
She's into preserving this special thing about her.

263
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:19,040
If it weren't for this special thing about her, she'd just be like the fishes, and that she would just go, as it looks like maybe he has, just forgotten the whole thing.

264
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,121
And she's not going to forget it.

265
00:21:21,121 --> 00:21:33,400
And so being in eternity is the wrong way to do it, because that means living the way she was living in the cellar, just sort of staring at the cat and licking the wall and just sort of out of touch with reality.

266
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:42,040
But when after a while she got so she could live in the world and still be in something like eternity.

267
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:45,321
So he says, and then one day, my love, you come out of eternity.

268
00:21:45,321 --> 00:21:47,400
And she says, yes, it takes a long time.

269
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,720
They told me it took a very long time.

270
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:54,281
And then she says, but finally she did.

271
00:21:54,281 --> 00:21:56,361
She said the winter was over.

272
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,720
And then, but she says, it's terrible.

273
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,961
I'm beginning to remember you less and less.

274
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:13,320
You see, every time she gets out of eternity, out of that sort of totally hypnotized state, she starts remembering, and time starts making her start forgetting him.

275
00:22:13,321 --> 00:22:16,121
And she starts telling her story again to him.

276
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:19,160
That's when she's drinking in the bar.

277
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,841
By the way, you remember the name of the bar?

278
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:27,321
I mean, every detail in this movie is so perfect.

279
00:22:27,321 --> 00:22:29,960
I mean, that's the Casablanca.

280
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,121
And what about the two lovers in Casablanca?

281
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,881
You've also seen Casablanca.

282
00:22:33,881 --> 00:22:35,160
What are they?

283
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:37,480
Well, they're nights of resignation.

284
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:48,920
Of course, she has to go off with her lover, who her husband, I guess he is, who's the resistance person, and he has to stay where he is in his bar in Casablanca.

285
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:57,080
And though they love each other, and finally, after all kinds of trouble, get together, they just have to remember, they have to just have the memory of it.

286
00:22:57,081 --> 00:22:59,160
So there were two nights of faith.

287
00:22:59,561 --> 00:23:10,881
And what's happening in this movie is, of course, somebody, did I say two nights of faith, sorry, two nights of resignation, because they're not sitting around waiting to ever get back together again.

288
00:23:11,841 --> 00:23:13,280
They've made this.

289
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,801
Doesn't he say something about it being a beautiful memory?

290
00:23:10,521 --> 00:23:17,601
I wonder if he does.

291
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,801
We'd have to look.

292
00:23:18,801 --> 00:23:21,521
But anyway, she certainly does.

293
00:23:21,521 --> 00:23:22,000
Yeah.

294
00:23:22,321 --> 00:23:23,440
We'll always have Paris.

295
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:23,920
Well, that's it.

296
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,361
That's the phrase, though, isn't it?

297
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:26,720
That's the same thing.

298
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,281
They've got a shared memory of the...

299
00:23:29,281 --> 00:23:30,160
That's perfect.

300
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:35,280
Of that one day they were together in Paris when they got their signals crossed and missed each other.

301
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:36,400
I forget why.

302
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,881
But that moment is in eternity.

303
00:23:38,881 --> 00:23:40,160
It's out of time.

304
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,961
It's perfect.

305
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,641
And it's what they've got.

306
00:23:42,641 --> 00:23:44,641
Yeah, Beatrice, do you want to say something more?

307
00:23:44,641 --> 00:23:46,320
That's perfect to bring that up.

308
00:23:46,561 --> 00:23:47,680
Grief.

309
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:55,440
Well, she is in something, but it isn't grief because, how will I?

310
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,521
Well, depends on what you mean by grief, of course.

311
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,800
She's suffering sorrow and misery and so forth.

312
00:24:05,121 --> 00:24:31,601
If you mean by grief, what I was trying to put on the board with my MIT diagram, where grief means the way you interiorize the person you love so that you can love another person, then she wasn't in grief because her basic problem in the movie is she can't love him, though she wants to, and though she sort of does, because, I mean, just we're jumping ahead, but it doesn't hurt to remind you.

313
00:24:33,601 --> 00:24:43,361
She's in the state, if this is her, of trying to keep the ideal memory of that relationship.

314
00:24:43,361 --> 00:24:45,280
And that's not grief.

315
00:24:45,281 --> 00:24:55,920
Well, her big problem is she's so lonely and she's so longs for him, and she's so sorry that she'll never see him again because he's dead.

316
00:24:56,361 --> 00:25:06,040
And if grief, I want to say, is something more this way, which is that you interiorize the person and are open to another.

317
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:10,521
I can't say more about it yet because I'm not ready to bring it into the story.

318
00:25:10,521 --> 00:25:13,160
Yeah, but go ahead, I can listen anyway.

319
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:20,441
Okay, that's true, but she's in a kind of eternity anyway, she says.

320
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:32,361
That is, she's what you can say is she's in something that is neither lower immediacy for sure, and she's not in higher immediacy either, for sure.

321
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:47,000
And she has various versions, I think, of mediation, whether she's reflecting on it, whether she's able to think about it, or whether she's in this sort of dazed state where it's all she does is sort of live in agony.

322
00:25:47,321 --> 00:25:57,400
But whatever they are, they don't produce a situation in which she can't get into the right relation to the Japanese man.

323
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,920
We have to talk more about that, and that's what the whole movie is about.

324
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,081
And so let's go on with that.

325
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:12,761
So finally, she manages to have some kind of eternity in time without being mad.

326
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,121
That's where we are.

327
00:26:14,121 --> 00:26:17,801
And that's when she leaves the room.

328
00:26:18,601 --> 00:26:37,720
But there's something about her that she takes, so to speak, with her, namely, some sense of not being in the world, but being outside the world, outside of time, or trying hard to be, and more or less tricky.

329
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:55,601
I mean, trying very hard and maybe succeeding and maybe failing, it isn't clear until the end of the movie, to be outside of time and finitude and always living in terms of the love of the German soldier.

330
00:26:55,601 --> 00:26:58,881
That's how it should be for her.

331
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:06,320
But, of course, it's hard to do, particularly if nature is constantly sort of undermining what you're doing.

332
00:27:06,321 --> 00:27:09,200
But let's go on, and you'll see it's clearer.

333
00:27:09,841 --> 00:27:11,760
So, what is she then?

334
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:26,800
After she comes out of eternity and into being the kind of person she is, and she's a person who is serene and joyful and at the same time, always sad.

335
00:27:26,801 --> 00:27:33,361
And she's got what Kierkegaard calls comfort in sorrow.

336
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:42,560
And you can see it in Fear and Trembling, it's all over the place, but I'll just read you one place on 74.

337
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:49,520
In infinite resignation, there is peace and repose and consolation in pain.

338
00:27:49,521 --> 00:28:02,320
And you see a picture of her in the book here, still from the movie, which is just perfect, which shows her looking extremely sad and yet beautiful and calm and so forth.

339
00:28:02,561 --> 00:28:05,281
And Marguerite Duras has a sense of this.

340
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,041
I want to show you that.

341
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,321
Let me see.

342
00:28:10,881 --> 00:28:20,160
When the author describes what she wants her to look like and do, oh, yeah, here's the picture, but holding it up won't help.

343
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,361
It's the picture.

344
00:28:21,361 --> 00:28:22,560
It's the picture.

345
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:27,720
You see her when she's looking at the Japanese man sleeping.

346
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:37,480
And she looks so sad and so loving and so much in a kind of repose and so tortured all at the same time.

347
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,680
It's really very remarkable.

348
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,520
But let me go back to something I can convey.

349
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:54,520
Okay, so it's when Marguerite Dura writes about her, then you get a clue as to what she thinks is going on.

350
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,920
But I've lost where it is.

351
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,201
Oh, I think it's way back in the beginning where we're describing these people.

352
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,760
Yeah.

353
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:07,561
What happened in Nversre, her native city, in that region called Nievre, where she was brought up?

354
00:29:07,561 --> 00:29:10,841
What happened to her to make her the way she is?

355
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,440
Now, how is she?

356
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:26,601
So free and yet so haunted, so honest and yet so dishonest, so equivocal and yet so clear, so predisposed to chance love affairs, so cowardly when faced with love.

357
00:29:26,601 --> 00:29:34,280
Well, that's a tremendously good description of her, and she's tremendously good to have brought it to the screen.

358
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,081
But let's go over them one by one.

359
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:40,280
In what way is she free and haunted?

360
00:29:40,281 --> 00:29:55,720
Well, take the case of her wandering around the hotel room, drinking her tea and feeling happy after they'd been making love and I think after they took a shower, and then all of a sudden, free and sort of serene as she is, what happens to her?

361
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,400
What haunts her?

362
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,041
Remember, she sees the hand of the German lover.

363
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:07,480
I mean, there's always the German lover sort of there just on the margin of whatever she's doing.

364
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,200
And now, the easier one is so honest and yet so dishonest.

365
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:12,560
I'm not going to tell you that one.

366
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,881
What's the dishonesty?

367
00:30:15,121 --> 00:30:24,800
She hasn't told her husband and kids, or let's just stick to her husband, that she's not at all acting like the person she really is.

368
00:30:24,801 --> 00:30:31,520
She isn't letting anyone get intimate with her, and she isn't letting anyone see what really matters to her.

369
00:30:31,521 --> 00:30:37,361
So she can be sort of trivially honest about her affairs and about her life and everything.

370
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:46,240
She just sort of bluntly tells the Japanese man that she likes men, that she's had lots of affairs, that her husband doesn't know, and so forth.

371
00:30:46,561 --> 00:30:57,440
And it doesn't, it just, all those kind of trivial honesties are possible because basically she's just living a kind of lie.

372
00:30:58,081 --> 00:31:01,440
And so equivocal and yet so clear is the same thing.

373
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:08,800
Somehow you can see everything that she's thinking, particularly when she's constantly sort of telling him that she's leaving him.

374
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:18,160
She's very clear about it, and yet she's always sort of not doing it and taking it back and showing how much she longs to stay with him.

375
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:26,480
And so she's trying to be clear, but there's something always happening that's sort of messing up the clarity.

376
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,841
Now let's go back and see.

377
00:31:27,841 --> 00:31:30,321
So that's because she's what?

378
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:32,801
What was, I don't have to ask you.

379
00:31:32,801 --> 00:31:35,041
She's a knight of infinite resignation.

380
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:36,240
Of course.

381
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,520
I mean, let me, how many understood that when you saw the movie?

382
00:31:39,521 --> 00:31:41,121
I'm just curious for future good.

383
00:31:41,121 --> 00:31:41,440
Good.

384
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,680
I just don't want to think that I'm showing, I mean, that I have to make a speech before the movie.

385
00:31:45,881 --> 00:31:47,200
You're good for you all.

386
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,840
Yes, of course.

387
00:31:47,841 --> 00:31:49,281
She's a knight of resignation.

388
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,960
A beautiful example.

389
00:31:50,960 --> 00:32:01,720
And that's what's why it's so great to have it in this course, because it all seems pretty hard to get when Kierkegaard's telling you in his poetic, philosophical way, but you can see it when you see her.

390
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:06,040
She's a knight of resignation, she's got infinite sadness.

391
00:32:06,361 --> 00:32:08,121
Why infinite sadness?

392
00:32:08,281 --> 00:32:10,601
And why infinite resignation?

393
00:32:10,601 --> 00:32:14,841
Well, that means that it's bigger than any of the things in the world.

394
00:32:14,841 --> 00:32:19,400
None of the situations in the world are what's making her sad.

395
00:32:22,281 --> 00:32:25,241
Everything about her existence is defined as sad.

396
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,521
That's what makes it infinite.

397
00:32:26,521 --> 00:32:31,400
Everything that would ever come into her world is already sad.

398
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:37,000
It's just her way of being that I'm trying to say is sad.

399
00:32:37,001 --> 00:32:40,921
That's what makes her infinite resignation and infinite sorrow.

400
00:32:40,921 --> 00:32:52,761
Anybody can be sorrow about some specific thing or other, but she's made this movement of resignation where she's given up the German lover in the finite and temporal altogether.

401
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,320
And she had better because he's dead.

402
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,601
But I mean, she has done it.

403
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:59,160
She has given him up altogether.

404
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:05,561
And that has changed her world so that everything is colored by that.

405
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:12,200
And that's, of course, why she can't get together with the Japanese man.

406
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:32,481
The infinite sadness, the infinite resignation has put her into a situation in which, if she does get involved with the Japanese man, I mean, besides just sexually involved, but really admits that she loves him, and they both agree they're going to stay together.

407
00:33:32,481 --> 00:33:37,561
Then we get stuff that starts happening at the end of the movie, which I'm not ready quite to go to yet.

408
00:33:37,561 --> 00:33:44,881
Her world starts falling apart because she's defined in terms of the relation, the love and lost.

409
00:33:46,001 --> 00:33:51,041
She loved and lost her first love, that foreign German soldier, et cetera.

410
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:52,481
That's her story.

411
00:33:52,481 --> 00:33:55,761
And there wouldn't be any her if she didn't have that story.

412
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,000
So let's go back and trace the story.

413
00:33:58,001 --> 00:34:03,280
So when she lost the lover, she wanted to be dead too.

414
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,921
That's one way to see it.

415
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:16,401
And that's the moment in which she's getting so sorry for herself, so deep into her sorrow, that he snaps her out of it.

416
00:34:18,961 --> 00:34:24,960
But it gives her this kind of ease and detachment that I already just read you, I think.

417
00:34:25,441 --> 00:34:27,440
There's another one, I don't think so.

418
00:34:28,081 --> 00:34:35,761
No, it gives her that business of being haunted and yet at ease and so forth that we talked about.

419
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:42,001
It also, another place Kierkegaard said, the knight says, the Knights of Resignation are bold.

420
00:34:42,001 --> 00:34:43,680
She is also bold.

421
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,961
She's bold because she's invulnerable.

422
00:34:46,961 --> 00:34:50,160
She can say anything and do anything.

423
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,520
Nothing can really touch her emotionally.

424
00:34:53,521 --> 00:34:57,040
That's both her success and her problem.

425
00:34:58,001 --> 00:35:05,200
It's a success because she holds on to the most meaningful thing in her life, her first love.

426
00:35:06,561 --> 00:35:10,721
But it's a problem because then she can't have any real intimacy.

427
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,801
So she's totally lonely.

428
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,200
And she has all these sexual encounters because she's so lonely.

429
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,200
But what she really wants is to be with a person, really with somebody.

430
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:29,081
She says at one point when she's falling and really getting involved with him, how great it is to be with somebody sometime.

431
00:35:29,081 --> 00:35:36,521
But in most of the time, she's alone because she's keeping all of her real feelings to herself.

432
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,001
So, for instance, on 68, that's where she says it.

433
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:47,801
She says, all of a sudden, she says in the middle of the page, oh, how good it is to be with someone sometime.

434
00:35:48,121 --> 00:35:53,881
And that's because she's for a moment feeling close to him.

435
00:35:53,880 --> 00:36:08,441
I mean, it's very complicated because she's constantly sort of risking falling in love with him, getting involved with him, getting back into the finite and temporal, really, you know, revealing herself instead of hiding herself.

436
00:36:08,441 --> 00:36:19,961
And she's both terribly tempted to this because the Kierkegaard jargon, you'll be in despair unless you get the finite and temporal in your life, and she hasn't got it.

437
00:36:19,961 --> 00:36:25,001
There's nothing finite and temporal in her life that has crucial meaning for her.

438
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:30,521
The only thing that has crucial meaning for her is her first love of the German soldier.

439
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:38,041
And that can only keep its crucial meaning for her, the way she set it up, as long as nothing in this world has crucial meaning for her.

440
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:51,001
So she's in that, that's her interesting, and that's just for Kierkegaard, pure Kierkegaard, that's the situation of the night of resignation, and we just have to follow it out.

441
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:52,680
So let's follow it out.

442
00:36:53,320 --> 00:37:06,761
For instance, I don't remember where it is in the movie, but I saw it once and wrote it down here: that there's a point where she reaches out to caress the Japanese man when they're in bed together, and instead of a caress, her hand turns into a fist.

443
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,281
Anybody remember that?

444
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,880
That went by so fast?

445
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,920
I didn't see it this round.

446
00:37:11,561 --> 00:37:14,800
But it's just a neat, and again, the details are amazing.

447
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:22,961
I mean, that's her fighting off this involvement that she's also getting being dragged into.

448
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:33,521
Okay, so the Japanese man understands what the problem is, and his job is to get her out of this narrative, out of this story, out of this identity.

449
00:37:33,521 --> 00:37:42,321
And so there they go to the Casablanca, oddly enough, or interestingly enough, and he gets her to tell her story.

450
00:37:42,641 --> 00:37:54,561
And to put it in a kind of slogan, which I like when I could think of them, he wants to get the story out of her, into the public, because that's the way of getting her out of her story.

451
00:37:54,561 --> 00:38:01,680
Because it's only when it's a special secret story that could never be told, then it's hers.

452
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:10,320
But if it becomes a story that she can tell, and then it's something that somebody else could have experienced too, then it's not really hers anymore, and she'd be free of it.

453
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:12,481
That's what he's trying to do.

454
00:38:12,481 --> 00:38:13,841
Yeah, Beatrice.

455
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,441
Has she left the ethical?

456
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:18,081
Oh, definitely, definitely she's outside the ethical.

457
00:38:18,081 --> 00:38:21,680
She remembers she says she's dubious of the ethics of others.

458
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:30,961
She's outside the ethical because the only authority that has any claim on her is the love of the German.

459
00:38:30,961 --> 00:38:37,441
And if the love of the German would require her, for instance, to kill the Japanese man, she'd have to kill the Japanese man.

460
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:42,641
It just doesn't happen that way, the way nobody set up the plot that way.

461
00:38:42,641 --> 00:38:49,520
But she would kill to keep that pure love of the Japanese man because that's what gives her life meaning.

462
00:38:49,521 --> 00:38:51,601
That's the only thing that's crucial.

463
00:38:51,601 --> 00:38:52,000
Yeah.

464
00:39:06,121 --> 00:39:23,160
And you try, and the therapist tries to get it out of you and get you to say it and see it and reflect on it as something that you can get rid of because it doesn't sort of permeate you and your world so completely that you live in it like the goldfish in the water.

465
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:30,361
Yeah, and that's what he that's the Japanese is trying to give her a very intense one evening of therapy with lots of beer.

466
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,721
And it works.

467
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:35,320
I mean, the interesting thing is he gets her to tell the story.

468
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:40,121
And that has, I mean, and he thought, he thinks now he's done it.

469
00:39:40,121 --> 00:39:41,641
Now he's freed her.

470
00:39:41,641 --> 00:39:44,440
He can have her and they can go off together.

471
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,561
You're just supposed to bracket the fact that they're both happily married.

472
00:39:47,561 --> 00:39:59,561
That's not, I mean, it just doesn't interest Marguerite Durat at all because there is this big metaphysical or whatever you want to call it, theological issue on the table.

473
00:39:59,561 --> 00:40:03,160
And he would have, he thought he succeeded.

474
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,441
And he did succeed.

475
00:40:04,441 --> 00:40:15,561
He succeeded in getting her to sort of objectify, reflect on, and mediate even more than it was before her story.

476
00:40:15,561 --> 00:40:21,960
And then to say one more sentence, and now we'll soon see in a minute how he totally backfires.

477
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:26,121
I mean, the fact that he did that was the end for him.

478
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,240
Go ahead.

479
00:40:27,561 --> 00:40:32,880
Even though she's probably reflecting on it, and she's always started just a moment.

480
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,720
She can.

481
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:34,601
That's right.

482
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:36,440
It's something, it's what you're raising.

483
00:40:36,441 --> 00:40:41,121
I can see as I answer you, you're raising interesting questions that are making me say puzzling things.

484
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,520
I mean, there's so many kinds of mediation.

485
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:53,041
It's as if she is constantly reflecting on it and keeping it in front of her as a kind of ideal and a kind of picture.

486
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,880
But that's still inner.

487
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:05,441
To be really mediated, it would have to be made public and put in public language, and that's just what she doesn't want because then it would lose its totally private, specific thing.

488
00:41:05,441 --> 00:41:08,561
So it's sort of half-mediated with her.

489
00:41:08,561 --> 00:41:19,601
I mean, that's, and the Japanese man is trying to make it totally public and universal and intelligible, and she wants to resist that.

490
00:41:19,601 --> 00:41:21,280
Yeah, that's right.

491
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:28,881
That means that, well, that's tied up with something very interesting and important, what you're saying.

492
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,121
Let me see if I can.

493
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:39,040
It's so subtle and complicated that I don't understand it too well, and I don't know how to begin to say it.

494
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:40,401
Let me think a minute.

495
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:50,481
They've got some secret in common, and that's what you're asking about.

496
00:41:50,481 --> 00:41:56,160
And if he were being pulled into her secret, that wouldn't be the right thing to be happening.

497
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:01,441
So he's happy that he's the only one who knows.

498
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,200
See, I'm trying to get, he's happy because they share.

499
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,320
I mean, you could bring it back to the you never saw anything.

500
00:42:08,641 --> 00:42:10,160
Yes, I saw everything.

501
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,320
He now sees that they share what they saw in Hiroshima.

502
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,921
They saw world disaster.

503
00:42:15,921 --> 00:42:18,481
And they understood what they understood in Hiroshima.

504
00:42:18,481 --> 00:42:20,241
They understood world disaster.

505
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,841
And what was the third thing?

506
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,160
Oh, and they left, well, I don't know, leptover.

507
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,440
No, that's her thing.

508
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,641
At least those two things.

509
00:42:27,561 --> 00:42:34,441
So he sees that he has this deep connection with her and always had it.

510
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:43,800
But now he sees that it gives him some kind of special right to her that her husband doesn't have, that nobody else has, because he's the only one who ever understood her.

511
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,921
That's the important thing.

512
00:42:44,921 --> 00:42:50,680
And what's really important, I'm going to say it earlier than I wanted to say it, but it's so relevant now.

513
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:56,680
What is it that gives him this special access to her that nobody else has?

514
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,160
Yeah.

515
00:42:58,041 --> 00:42:59,561
You're on the right track.

516
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:09,400
I don't think it's something I put in the she needs in the truth.

517
00:43:09,401 --> 00:43:15,481
Because they both need that these limits of their life where she puts any principles on his person.

518
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,680
Yeah, you're on the right, exactly on the right track.

519
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:22,521
But you have to put it a little further to make it.

520
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:32,601
Why is he, at one point he sits up in bed and he looks at her when she says something about Never in some way, and she says, why do you care about Nevers?

521
00:43:32,601 --> 00:43:37,880
And he says, I have come to understand that it was in Never that you became the person you are and so forth.

522
00:43:38,441 --> 00:43:51,481
What's happening is he's the only one who can understand her, or maybe the only, maybe there are others, but in this case, he's the only one who's around who's succeeded in ever understanding her.

523
00:43:51,481 --> 00:43:57,001
Because, and now comes the crucial thing, he had an identical disaster.

524
00:43:57,001 --> 00:44:02,121
So he's understanding her through his experience of the disaster.

525
00:44:02,121 --> 00:44:05,560
That's why he knows that she spit into her mother's face.

526
00:44:05,561 --> 00:44:12,080
That's why he knows that she would want to get out of it if she could, and he's trying to help her get out of it, and he sees how she's trapped in it.

527
00:44:12,081 --> 00:44:25,921
But the basic thing to remember is that he relates to her through his experience of the total destruction of everything that was important in his life and of Hiroshima.

528
00:44:25,921 --> 00:44:29,440
And only because he's experienced that can he get to her.

529
00:44:29,441 --> 00:44:29,760
Yeah.

530
00:44:32,001 --> 00:44:33,920
Well, how come he can love her since she's stuck?

531
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:34,800
Why isn't he stuck?

532
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,840
Is that what you're saying?

533
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,921
Well, that's a terrific question.

534
00:44:37,921 --> 00:44:42,480
It's got a one-sentence answer, but I'm not going to tell it.

535
00:44:42,481 --> 00:44:44,480
Somebody, somebody, what's the answer?

536
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:45,280
I mean, we have to jump.

537
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,281
You're jumping way ahead, but we'll.

538
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,521
What is he?

539
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,760
Of course, he's a knight of faith.

540
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,521
He's got an entirely different relation to the disaster.

541
00:44:55,521 --> 00:45:01,441
He did not turn the disaster into an ideal thing and get stuck on it.

542
00:45:01,441 --> 00:45:05,281
And we're so close to getting the whole answer that I think we should just go on.

543
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,801
What did he do?

544
00:45:07,441 --> 00:45:08,561
Well, he did it.

545
00:45:08,561 --> 00:45:10,000
He turned it into something.

546
00:45:10,001 --> 00:45:11,761
We don't know much about it yet.

547
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:18,961
It became a part of him such that he could get access to her and the world through it.

548
00:45:18,961 --> 00:45:20,320
I mean, that's what that's.

549
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,521
He did this.

550
00:45:21,521 --> 00:45:23,200
He's a knight of resignation.

551
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,560
He's a knight of faith.

552
00:45:24,561 --> 00:45:34,481
They both had the disaster, but his relation to the disaster becomes his way of being open to other people in the world.

553
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:40,241
And her way of taking the disaster makes her totally self-sufficient and closed to other people in the world.

554
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,840
And that's because she's a knight of resignation.

555
00:45:42,081 --> 00:45:46,561
And in other words, she's a knight of resignation, and he's a knight of faith.

556
00:45:46,561 --> 00:45:47,121
Yeah.

557
00:45:47,441 --> 00:45:48,320
Good, good, good.

558
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,520
All you guys are onto something.

559
00:45:49,521 --> 00:45:50,081
Yeah.

560
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,840
You're half on it.

561
00:45:52,481 --> 00:45:54,480
You need another piece, but you got it right.

562
00:45:54,481 --> 00:45:59,401
Being an architect is very important, and it fits exactly with what he should be doing.

563
00:45:59,401 --> 00:46:01,560
But it's not a thing about himself.

564
00:46:01,561 --> 00:46:03,561
We need a new character on the scene.

565
00:46:04,601 --> 00:46:05,961
We've talked about him.

566
00:46:05,961 --> 00:46:07,481
We've talked about her.

567
00:46:07,481 --> 00:46:08,040
Who else?

568
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:08,840
Not the German.

569
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,720
We never see the German.

570
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,200
There's only one other important character.

571
00:46:12,521 --> 00:46:16,840
If I'm being a strange way to put it, it's Hiroshima.

572
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,560
Who said that?

573
00:46:17,561 --> 00:46:21,881
In spite of my saying it in a crazy way, who said it?

574
00:46:22,601 --> 00:46:23,160
You said it?

575
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:23,880
Somebody else, too.

576
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,920
Two people said it.

577
00:46:24,921 --> 00:46:25,720
Somebody up here.

578
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,320
Anyway, yes, the third character on the scene is Hiroshima.

579
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,001
Because Hiroshima, he's Hiroshima, you know.

580
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:34,520
So you've got to figure this out.

581
00:46:34,521 --> 00:46:37,241
When she says he's Hiroshima, she's right.

582
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,200
What is it about Hiroshima that's interesting?

583
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,361
Well, this is the thing I missed for 10 years.

584
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:50,841
I thought, well, Hiroshima bounced back with total energy and lots of lights, just as if it was lower immediacy.

585
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:56,361
And only people could be mediated and become higher immediacy.

586
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,881
But that's wrong.

587
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,200
And now let's talk about it while we're at it.

588
00:47:01,081 --> 00:47:03,880
And don't let me forget the architect point.

589
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:04,601
But let's see.

590
00:47:04,601 --> 00:47:06,680
Tell me things about Hiroshima.

591
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,961
What is the name of the hotel in Hiroshima?

592
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,041
The new Hiroshima.

593
00:47:12,041 --> 00:47:13,321
That's interesting.

594
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,441
I mean, they could have named it the Hiroshima Hilton.

595
00:47:16,441 --> 00:47:18,601
They could have just, you know, built it.

596
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,680
That would be to be like the fish.

597
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:24,521
I mean, they would just build a new hotel and give it a new name.

598
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:30,441
Or they could have just left the rubble of the hotel, the way they did leave the rubble, was one building.

599
00:47:30,441 --> 00:47:36,441
What I'm asking is: what is the relation of the people of Hiroshima to the disaster?

600
00:47:37,001 --> 00:47:44,561
And the answer's got to be: they don't forget it, and yet they never think about it.

601
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:51,041
You notice that he doesn't tell her which parents and relatives and wives and kids were killed.

602
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:54,481
He doesn't say, Come over here, I'll show you where our house used to be.

603
00:47:54,481 --> 00:47:58,081
He doesn't think about the disaster at all.

604
00:47:58,401 --> 00:48:02,880
But what everything he does think about, he thinks about in terms of the disaster.

605
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,641
Now we're back to the architect.

606
00:48:04,641 --> 00:48:07,680
What's the role of an architect in Hiroshima?

607
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:16,481
It's to build the new Hiroshima, which is, in other words, to not get stuck in the disaster and live in the rubble.

608
00:48:16,481 --> 00:48:26,721
That's what she's doing in the darkness of Nevair, but to build a new Hiroshima, which remembers that it was the old, that it was destroyed.

609
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,760
What else is there that reminds it that it was destroyed?

610
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,841
Well, there's that one destroyed building that they keep, a sort of cathedral-like.

611
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,601
And the museum, absolutely.

612
00:48:35,601 --> 00:48:38,801
He doesn't go to the museum, but they've got a museum.

613
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,441
And they make peace movies there.

614
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,641
And at one point, he says, I think it's interesting, I couldn't find it in here, but I've heard it in the movie.

615
00:48:46,641 --> 00:48:58,481
He says something, and he says, We don't joke about peace in Hiroshima, meaning this is a very, this is not just very serious, this is an absolutely serious issue to them, war and peace.

616
00:48:58,481 --> 00:49:01,601
And they're always there making these peace movies.

617
00:49:01,601 --> 00:49:05,361
And we're now, you with your architect, what else is he?

618
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,121
A politician.

619
00:49:07,121 --> 00:49:14,801
And why is that something that is, again, related to the city and related in how he deals with things?

620
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,440
All right?

621
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,960
Well, he wants to, I couldn't hear you very well, but anyway, I think I heard you.

622
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,160
He wants to, the politicians are changing the world.

623
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:26,280
He's trying to change the world so that there won't be another disaster.

624
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,160
It isn't as if they've just forgotten the disaster.

625
00:49:25,521 --> 00:49:31,080
But they don't think about the disaster.

626
00:49:26,001 --> 00:49:32,921
They think about making a better world.

627
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:40,200
They think about making new buildings and a new hotel and so forth and so forth.

628
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:51,721
So what's interesting is that his whole way of life depends on having been devastated by the Hiroshima disaster.

629
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:57,081
To be a politician, to learn French, because they're about, I don't know really why.

630
00:49:57,081 --> 00:49:59,160
He says because to read about the French Revolution.

631
00:49:59,401 --> 00:49:59,960
Why not?

632
00:49:59,961 --> 00:50:00,680
I don't know.

633
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:08,921
But anyway, to be a politician, to learn French, to be an architect, to fall in love with this woman who had a similar disaster.

634
00:50:08,921 --> 00:50:21,321
Everything that we know about him, I mean, we don't know about his family and kids, but everything we know about him happens to him because his world was destroyed when Hiroshima was destroyed.

635
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:25,240
And he has taken it over so much.

636
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,601
I keep wanting to stress this.

637
00:50:26,601 --> 00:50:28,920
This is the thing Kierkegaard doesn't understand.

638
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,880
This is what it is to get a new Isaac.

639
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:44,921
He has taken over the disaster in such a way as to forget it in the sense that he never thinks about it and to remember it in the sense that everything he thinks about, he thinks about in terms of it.

640
00:50:44,921 --> 00:50:49,321
It's a very, very interesting move he makes.

641
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,081
And he makes it just right.

642
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:54,121
And the city makes it just right.

643
00:50:54,121 --> 00:50:55,081
Okay, how do we do it?

644
00:50:55,081 --> 00:50:56,200
Well, I think we've got to go on.

645
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,081
So let me go see.

646
00:50:57,481 --> 00:51:00,281
We're not far behind where I want to be.

647
00:51:01,481 --> 00:51:09,081
So let's contrast Hiroshima with Never for a minute.

648
00:51:09,081 --> 00:51:19,920
I mean, Hiroshima is lively and thriving, but always also remembering, whereas Never is like she is.

649
00:51:20,001 --> 00:51:23,760
Remember, he calls her Never at the end of the last line of the movie, just like she calls.

650
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,761
She sees that he's Hiroshima.

651
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:33,601
She sees that he's something she can't have, that he's been in the disaster and he's more alive and more in the finite and temporal than ever.

652
00:51:33,601 --> 00:51:38,400
He sees that she's Never and he can't have her because what?

653
00:51:38,401 --> 00:51:41,841
Because Never is frozen in the past.

654
00:51:42,961 --> 00:51:50,561
If you could make the movie in black and white and color, Never would be in black and white, and Hiroshima really cries out to be in color.

655
00:51:50,561 --> 00:51:54,240
If I were making the movie, maybe I'd have her in black and white and him in color.

656
00:51:54,561 --> 00:51:56,561
You're lucky I'm not making the movie.

657
00:51:57,521 --> 00:52:00,881
But that's the feeling you get.

658
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:05,600
And that's important.

659
00:52:05,921 --> 00:52:12,721
And her memory of the German countryside is all sort of romantic and beautiful and so forth.

660
00:52:14,081 --> 00:52:15,680
I don't think I have anything to say about that.

661
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:24,721
Well, it's all she's turning it, it's part of the ideal of this first love, hiding in the woods with this lover and so forth.

662
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,561
And okay, let's go on.

663
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,800
I'll get back to Hiroshima.

664
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,680
Well, how does his therapy backfire?

665
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,881
She tells him his story, her story.

666
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:52,081
And instead of getting it out of her, so to speak, so she can now get some distance from it, instead of sort of wallowing in her suffering, what happens is she gets convinced that she's been unfaithful to the German.

667
00:52:52,401 --> 00:52:54,560
And that's the end for him.

668
00:52:54,561 --> 00:53:04,680
That is, she's betrayed the one thing that gives meaning to her life by just turning it, as she keeps saying, turning it into a three-penny story, turning it into a song.

669
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:13,001
She means just turning it into something trivial that could have happened to anybody, not sort of a world-defining and world-destroying experience.

670
00:53:13,001 --> 00:53:15,001
This is on 73.

671
00:53:15,001 --> 00:53:17,641
To the German, she's talking, You are not quite dead.

672
00:53:17,641 --> 00:53:18,760
I told our story.

673
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,321
I was unfaithful to you tonight with this stranger.

674
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,521
I told our story.

675
00:53:22,521 --> 00:53:24,921
You see, it was a story that could be told.

676
00:53:24,921 --> 00:53:30,440
For 14 years, I haven't found the taste of impossible love again since Nevair.

677
00:53:30,441 --> 00:53:32,281
Look how I'm forgetting you.

678
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,321
Look at me.

679
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:46,121
That is, she's tempted now to turn him into an object or a memory, but a memory that she could now leave behind or do something else with and go on with the Japanese.

680
00:53:46,121 --> 00:53:50,840
But she can't, she has no understanding of getting a new Isaac.

681
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:59,481
She has no understanding of this puzzling, amazing thing that people can do, which is really impossible irrationally.

682
00:53:59,481 --> 00:54:11,081
Go through grief, make the first defining thing a part of themselves, so that everything they do, they do in terms of it, and remain open to a new finite temporal defining thing.

683
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,521
She can't do that.

684
00:54:12,521 --> 00:54:33,641
And because she can't do that, she bounces back and forth between thinking that she's got to be true to the German or her life will lose all of its meaning, and thinking that she wants to get involved with the finite temporal Japanese man, really, with a profound intimacy and love.

685
00:54:33,641 --> 00:54:35,721
And she can't do it.

686
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:44,081
And so she's telling, she's saying, Look to the German, I'm betraying you, I'm forgetting you.

687
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:46,081
And now comes this interesting move.

688
00:54:47,121 --> 00:54:49,441
I didn't understand this for a long time.

689
00:54:50,401 --> 00:54:51,120
Why?

690
00:54:51,601 --> 00:55:01,121
What does she finally do to preserve the meaning of the love of the German, of her first love?

691
00:55:01,121 --> 00:55:12,320
Because not being a knight of faith, she can't turn it into interiorize it the way the Japanese man did, so that she could forget it and remember it.

692
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,481
She can't make that complicated move.

693
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:17,121
She doesn't really understand forgetting, as he says.

694
00:55:17,121 --> 00:55:18,801
So she can't do that.

695
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,961
So what does she have to do?

696
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:27,200
And I didn't really realize it until I'll read you the scene where it happens.

697
00:55:27,521 --> 00:55:29,680
He says, she's giving him up, the German.

698
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:33,041
Three penny story, I bequeath you to oblivion.

699
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:38,481
Three penny story, you will disappear just as he will, and so forth.

700
00:55:38,481 --> 00:55:53,360
And she sees that if she betrays the German from her point of view, in order to go with the Japanese, she'll betray the Japanese too, because everything will just go down to being lower nature.

701
00:55:53,840 --> 00:56:10,401
She says, the Japanese man at the end, very near, right at the end, she buries her head in her hands there in the hotel room, clenches her fist, closes her eyes, and moans a moan of utter sadness.

702
00:56:11,041 --> 00:56:13,921
The light of the city is in her eyes.

703
00:56:13,921 --> 00:56:15,841
That is, she's looking at him.

704
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,361
He's the light of the city, really.

705
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,840
But she doesn't really see it.

706
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:22,960
Never mind the light of the city.

707
00:56:23,121 --> 00:56:24,880
That's me putting in too much.

708
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,400
A moan of utter sadness.

709
00:56:27,001 --> 00:56:29,721
And what is the utter sadness?

710
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,081
Well, that's despair, the moan of utter sadness.

711
00:56:33,081 --> 00:56:40,121
She sees that she cannot keep the meaning in her life unless she gives up the finite and temporal.

712
00:56:40,121 --> 00:56:51,321
Because otherwise, in her world, all she would do was go from lover to lover, betraying the German because she loves the Japanese, and then betraying the Japanese when the next person comes along.

713
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:54,920
She says to the Japanese man, I'll forget you.

714
00:56:54,921 --> 00:56:56,761
I'm forgetting you already.

715
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,841
Look how I'm forgetting you.

716
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,041
Look at me.

717
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:05,241
And then she calls to him, this is the directions from afar, lost in wonder.

718
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:11,241
She succeeded in drowning him in universal oblivion, and it's a source of amazement to her.

719
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:17,721
She wipes out the Japanese man in order to preserve the meaning of her life.

720
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:42,680
And the way I would like to put it is, when he gets her to see the whole situation and makes her see that she's either got to give up the German from her point of view and go with him, the Japanese man, or else remain faithful to the German, what she understands when she sees it is that she's got to sacrifice her life to preserve the meaning of the German.

721
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:43,961
That's what she's doing.

722
00:57:45,001 --> 00:57:53,801
When she says to the Japanese man, I'm forgetting you, she means you don't count, only the Japanese man counts.

723
00:57:53,800 --> 00:58:08,841
I'm sacrificing the temporal, finite, everyday, intimate meaning of my life, here and now, to preserve the meaning, the only thing that really matters in my life, the love of the German.

724
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,200
And that's what happens.

725
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,680
That's why they can't get together in the end.

726
00:58:11,481 --> 00:58:15,840
Now, I jumped way ahead.

727
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:21,280
So I want to go back, but I want to see if I've lost you all or whether there's somebody you want to say something.

728
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:21,840
Go ahead.

729
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:31,041
If she fears that she'll go back to the gifts, but then is it depending on the person because the Japanese bad?

730
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,321
That's right.

731
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,281
It is.

732
00:58:33,601 --> 00:58:34,241
Yes.

733
00:58:35,921 --> 00:58:37,040
He wasn't able.

734
00:58:37,041 --> 00:58:37,921
Exactly.

735
00:58:37,921 --> 00:58:39,200
You're on the right track.

736
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,881
Being able to be a knight of faith or not is a kind of grace.

737
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,001
It's a kind of thing you can't do by your willpower.

738
00:58:46,001 --> 00:58:52,721
You can be a knight of resignation by your willpower, and she's got the strength to think it and do it, as Kierkegaard would put it.

739
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,441
But he's got something else.

740
00:58:55,441 --> 00:59:00,721
He's got, if you put it in Kierkegaard terms, faith in the absurd.

741
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:10,880
That is, he is able to go through grief, which seems an impossible frame of mind and make something that seems impossible happen.

742
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:19,841
What seems impossible is that you could remain true to the person you've defined yourself in terms of and still define yourself in terms of somebody else.

743
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,841
That looks impossible.

744
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:29,121
It's only possible if you'll give up this kind of memory for this incorporated kind of memory.

745
00:59:29,121 --> 00:59:36,881
And you can only do this in the sort of space or field or something that even the impossible is possible.

746
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,240
That is the field of faith.

747
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:45,521
That is a certain kind of trust and vulnerability that the Japanese man obviously has.

748
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:49,760
If that's any help, yes, you have to be a different kind of person.

749
00:59:56,041 --> 00:59:56,680
That's right, Greg.

750
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:59,160
But before you say anything, he said something very interesting.

751
00:59:53,521 --> 01:00:01,561
I want to follow up on it, which is the following.

752
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:03,881
He knows that.

753
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:07,241
This has got to do with this, the Y-shaped chart.

754
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:27,241
She's a knight of resignation, which means that at the moment when she became, made the movements of resignation here, she went up here and became a knight of resignation and took all her energy into her defenses and into idealizing and keeping remembering and telling herself this story.

755
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:37,721
Whereas he, when he was in a disaster and made the movement of resignation, got up here to be a knight of faith and did what we saw over there.

756
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:44,441
But now, how could we, now his question is, what could save her?

757
01:00:45,081 --> 01:00:51,481
Well, only what could save her would have to be that her whole personality would be destroyed.

758
01:00:51,481 --> 01:01:04,441
The whole kind of person she was, namely the kind that actually, you know, has to have faith in the person their first love or their life will become meaningless and they're holding on to it and they've got the willpower and the strength to do it.

759
01:01:04,441 --> 01:01:06,361
She's that kind of person.

760
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:14,521
And the interesting thing is, and that's why I thought what he's saying is interesting to what we're saying, she understands that.

761
01:01:14,521 --> 01:01:18,121
And in her way, let me see if I can find it.

762
01:01:19,481 --> 01:01:20,601
I know what I want to say.

763
01:01:20,601 --> 01:01:25,801
I just would like to find the quotes because the quotes are so interesting.

764
01:01:26,041 --> 01:01:34,920
What she has to do is she has to, she begs him to destroy her, you know, and to change her into his image.

765
01:01:34,921 --> 01:01:36,921
First, it's one of these little reversals.

766
01:01:36,921 --> 01:01:39,720
The first time she says it, you destroy me.

767
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,760
This is 25.

768
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:43,841
You're so good for me, you destroy me, you're good for me.

769
01:01:41,481 --> 01:01:46,960
You're great, how wonderful, you're great.

770
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:55,761
That's just a kind of sexual story about how he just completely blows her mind and gives her satisfaction and so forth.

771
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:03,200
But that's not what she gets to later, where it gets reversed into something else, which I have to find.

772
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:08,241
By the way, architecture and politics, just in case anybody wants to find it, is on page 34.

773
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,160
I just found it in passing.

774
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:16,881
Now, we get into a lot of destroy me talk pretty soon, and that's what I want to find.

775
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,720
Okay, I'm getting there.

776
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:41,601
It's toward the end of it, where you expect it, where she finally sees that she's in this trap, where she finally sees that she's in despair, because she can't be a knight of faith unless she gives up completely the kind of person she is, not only the German as somebody she remembers in front of her, but her whole attitude for preserving the meaning.

777
01:02:41,601 --> 01:02:48,320
And then she says toward the end, and now it means something different: you were made to the size of my body, who are you?

778
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:49,601
You destroy me.

779
01:02:49,601 --> 01:02:52,800
I was hungry for infidelity, and you destroy me.

780
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,401
You're so good for me.

781
01:02:54,401 --> 01:02:55,440
That's not it quite.

782
01:02:55,441 --> 01:02:58,481
That's still, that's ambiguous, what's going on there.

783
01:02:58,481 --> 01:03:03,360
I want there's a crucial place, and oh, I don't know if I'll be able to find it.

784
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,081
You might help me.

785
01:03:04,081 --> 01:03:05,360
No, you don't have a thing in front of you.

786
01:03:05,521 --> 01:03:06,560
You can't help me.

787
01:03:06,561 --> 01:03:08,481
Okay, then I have to find it.

788
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:13,840
It says, Destroy me and change me into your likeness.

789
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,281
That's what I'm looking for.

790
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:22,801
Where then the men that destroy means, get rid of me as a knight of resignation, turn me into a knight of faith, is what she wants to say.

791
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:26,921
And I just don't know where it is, and I'm amazed I can't find it.

792
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:29,401
Oh boy, Beatrice is going to find it.

793
01:03:29,401 --> 01:03:31,401
Hell, I hope so.

794
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:33,001
You destroy me.

795
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:34,761
You're so good for me.

796
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:35,720
Ah, yeah, you're right.

797
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:36,200
It was right.

798
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:39,240
That's the page I was on, but I didn't have it underlined.

799
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:43,721
It's in the middle of page 77, which is very important.

800
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:47,160
Take me, deform me to your likeness.

801
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,441
That's what I was looking for.

802
01:03:50,921 --> 01:04:04,680
So she understands that the only way she could get from being a knight of resignation to being a knight of faith is if he could even more blow her mind than he's done already with the sort of therapy that he was trying to give her.

803
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:13,401
He would have to just get her to stop understanding anything the way she understands it, seeing anything the way she sees it.

804
01:04:13,401 --> 01:04:36,361
He'd have to get her to believe that even the impossible is possible, or believe isn't even right, to experience the world in faith, in the Kierkegaardian kind of faith, namely that there's some other possibility which you can't really think, which isn't lower immediacy and isn't eternalizing kind of mediation either.

805
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:39,401
Okay, now, yeah, go ahead.

806
01:04:39,641 --> 01:04:41,561
Yes, good question.

807
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:45,720
I think the answer is exactly like fear and trembling.

808
01:04:46,441 --> 01:04:50,440
Does Johannes de Salentio understand that there are knights of resignation?

809
01:04:50,441 --> 01:04:51,960
I mean, knights of faith?

810
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:54,680
Sure, he keeps talking about them all the time.

811
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:58,521
But does he understand what they're doing and how they're doing it?

812
01:04:58,521 --> 01:05:01,241
No, he keeps saying, I can't understand them at all.

813
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:03,560
All he can say is it's incomprehensible.

814
01:05:04,041 --> 01:05:10,200
They live as if the sword is hanging over the head of the beloved, and then they have no defenses as if it's the surest thing of all.

815
01:05:11,001 --> 01:05:17,200
They know that they're going to kill Isaac, and yet Abraham knows he's going to kill Isaac, and yet he lives as if he's always going to have Isaac.

816
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:20,081
So when he doesn't have Isaac, he's not even surprised.

817
01:05:20,081 --> 01:05:35,360
And so, in other words, so it looks like Knights of Resignation can understand that Knights of Faith are doing something very special that they can't do, but they can't really make any sense out of it because it's not rational.

818
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:38,080
It's paradoxical and impossible.

819
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:50,720
The movie is written exactly from the same perspective, namely her perspective, as the night, as Jeremy Pembling is from the DeSilentio's perspective.

820
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:53,921
We never really understand the Japanese perspective.

821
01:05:54,401 --> 01:06:06,320
And because it only comes by, just in a second, in this way, she noticed by little things that he happens to be an architect, that he happens to be a politician, that he knows French, that he understood her.

822
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:08,001
That's the most important thing.

823
01:06:08,001 --> 01:06:22,721
As soon as he saw her start to talk about Novere, those are all things that make us aware that he's a knight of faith and something that you could see, but the Knights of Resignation don't know how he's doing that.

824
01:06:22,961 --> 01:06:24,320
Wait, somebody had a hand up here.

825
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:24,481
Yeah.

826
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:36,241
Market despair is not when the German dies, but when she meets the Japanese and discovers that the whole world, the whole life that she had lived before then was threatening to fall apart once again.

827
01:06:37,601 --> 01:06:40,960
No, you were half there, then you blew it.

828
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,240
The first half, yes, there's something very important.

829
01:06:44,241 --> 01:06:48,800
Despair happens when she meets the Japanese.

830
01:06:48,800 --> 01:07:00,040
But the despair that happens is she understands that the kind of life she's got is going to be condemned to despair.

831
01:07:00,201 --> 01:07:07,561
If she stays with the Japanese man, she's going to not have fulfillment of what's temporal and finite, and she needs that.

832
01:07:07,561 --> 01:07:17,320
If she goes with the Japanese man, she's going to betray the German, and therefore she will also betray the Japanese man, and she won't have anything eternal in her life, and she needs that.

833
01:07:17,321 --> 01:07:22,601
She can't get the eternal and the temporal and finite together.

834
01:07:22,601 --> 01:07:26,920
And when she didn't really understand that, when the German died, that's your important point.

835
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:29,960
She just thought it was suffering, misery, sorrow, grief.

836
01:07:30,361 --> 01:07:32,280
How could such a bad thing happen to me?

837
01:07:32,281 --> 01:07:33,800
I lost my first love.

838
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,481
But that's not despair.

839
01:07:35,481 --> 01:07:37,400
That's just misery.

840
01:07:37,401 --> 01:07:44,441
And despair is when you see that the very structure of your life makes it impossible for you to be happy.

841
01:07:44,441 --> 01:07:47,240
And you never were happy, and you never could be happy.

842
01:07:47,241 --> 01:07:50,040
And even if the German hadn't died, you wouldn't really be happy.

843
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:51,800
And then she sees that.

844
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:55,481
And that's the thing that this forces her to see.

845
01:07:55,481 --> 01:07:57,000
I saw another hand up.

846
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:57,401
Yeah.

847
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,401
Yes, that's right.

848
01:07:59,401 --> 01:08:03,641
She would never, in Kierkegaard jargon, I'm not getting ahead of the Kierkegaard story.

849
01:08:03,641 --> 01:08:07,240
You'll hear about despair in the last Kierkegaard lecture.

850
01:08:08,201 --> 01:08:12,760
She would have been in lower immediacy, but she would have been in despair without knowing it.

851
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:16,040
And what that means in Kierkegaard, we have to explain.

852
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:16,920
It's very interesting.

853
01:08:17,481 --> 01:08:19,000
It's brilliant in Kierkegaard.

854
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:22,920
Just ask yourself, put it on hold.

855
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:35,400
How can Kierkegaard say to all of you and me, no matter how happy you think you are, no matter how well your life is going, no matter what hopes you have, you're all in despair.

856
01:08:35,401 --> 01:08:36,521
How can he tell you that?

857
01:08:36,521 --> 01:08:38,040
What kind of craziness is that?

858
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:42,400
Well, he's got a very, very interesting argument that goes to prove that.

859
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:51,521
So she's in despair until the moment that she sees that she has to be a knight of faith or she's going to stay in despair.

860
01:08:51,521 --> 01:08:53,361
And she chooses to stay in despair.

861
01:08:53,361 --> 01:08:54,641
She doesn't choose it.

862
01:08:54,641 --> 01:08:57,120
Given the life she's got, she can't get out of it.

863
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,120
And he, he's not in despair.

864
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:06,880
He's managed to get together the finite and the temporal and keep the meaning and keep the memory all together.

865
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:07,280
Yeah.

866
01:09:07,601 --> 01:09:09,200
Become a knight of faith.

867
01:09:09,521 --> 01:09:10,561
That's the knight of verse.

868
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:11,361
Of what?

869
01:09:11,361 --> 01:09:12,401
Of resignation.

870
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:16,561
So it would just have to be contingent on herself.

871
01:09:17,601 --> 01:09:18,241
No, no, no.

872
01:09:18,641 --> 01:09:20,320
You see, even that wouldn't do it.

873
01:09:20,321 --> 01:09:23,360
I mean, it wouldn't be enough to throw her into resignation.

874
01:09:23,361 --> 01:09:37,360
It wouldn't even be enough for getting her to be a knight of faith, which is what you're talking about, to get her to see that her current way of life is despair, because she can't get the eternal and the temporal together because he's got to also destroy her, whatever that means.

875
01:09:37,361 --> 01:09:38,960
That this mysterious thing.

876
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:43,521
He's got to really, I mean, it's hard to know what it would be to do it.

877
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:46,240
If he couldn't do it, it looks like nobody could do it.

878
01:09:46,241 --> 01:09:55,680
But she understands that unless her whole way of life is just wiped out, she won't be able to get out of it and get into faith.

879
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:59,200
What she knows is that it's a paradox.

880
01:09:59,201 --> 01:10:00,401
It can't be thought.

881
01:10:00,401 --> 01:10:02,080
It can't be understood.

882
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:08,960
And she can't do it because she's only able to do what can be thought and understood and sort of rationally done.

883
01:10:09,281 --> 01:10:10,880
So another hand.

884
01:10:11,201 --> 01:10:11,840
Yeah.

885
01:10:16,641 --> 01:10:18,561
He, oh, that's wonderful what you're saying.

886
01:10:18,561 --> 01:10:20,401
Only you don't know how wonderful it is.

887
01:10:20,641 --> 01:10:21,680
But follow it up.

888
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:30,120
Ask yourself: well, okay, so he got a new opportunity to rebuild the new Hiroshima and do it out of his experience of the destruction.

889
01:10:30,441 --> 01:10:31,880
And now what about her?

890
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:37,720
Sh we don't know what her opportunity was, but we know what her job is.

891
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,320
What is her job?

892
01:10:40,281 --> 01:10:41,641
Actress in what?

893
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:45,880
In a piece film and in only piece films.

894
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:49,481
And now that's I can't tell you what she should have done.

895
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:51,080
I'm only to tell you half.

896
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:55,481
Notice what's so characteristic of her that she's doing that.

897
01:10:55,481 --> 01:10:58,280
What is it to be an actress in peace films?

898
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:02,840
Is it being like politicians or architects sort of building a new world?

899
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:04,360
It could be maybe.

900
01:11:04,361 --> 01:11:05,080
But yeah.

901
01:11:08,361 --> 01:11:11,561
She's reenacting and reenacting the disaster.

902
01:11:11,561 --> 01:11:19,880
She comes to Hiroshima and she does just what a night of resignation should do, keep alive and keep the memory.

903
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:21,000
He's not interested.

904
01:11:21,161 --> 01:11:22,601
I never thought of putting it this way.

905
01:11:22,601 --> 01:11:26,601
It's just a crowd getting in his way, that movie and that parade.

906
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:31,880
And he doesn't care a bit because his relation to Hiroshima is so much deeper.

907
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:36,120
But she has she's now your question is still there.

908
01:11:36,201 --> 01:11:37,481
I don't know how to answer it.

909
01:11:37,481 --> 01:11:50,680
What she could have done instead to turn her love of the German into something interior to her, out of which she could understand the world and know what to do for the finite and temporal way.

910
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:59,160
Certainly she did it exactly right for a night of resignation and exactly wrong if she for a night of faith, but that's what you'd expect.

911
01:11:59,161 --> 01:12:00,521
That's all I can say about it.

912
01:12:01,401 --> 01:12:03,080
I've only got three more minutes, and there's something.

913
01:12:03,241 --> 01:12:06,200
Oh, yeah, I'll take your question, and then I have to do my sort of summary.

914
01:12:06,201 --> 01:12:09,760
Yeah, should not also move on.

915
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:11,680
So, isn't that a resignation?

916
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:14,400
Yes, doesn't want to move on.

917
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:33,920
The night of resignation has the following idea: if I move on, I will forget the German, and the German, the love of the German, my first love of that wonderful person, was the best thing, the most meaningful thing, not only in my life, it defined me in my life.

918
01:12:34,561 --> 01:12:36,960
It's what made my life worth living.

919
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,241
So, I can't move on.

920
01:12:38,241 --> 01:12:39,680
That's her problem.

921
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:51,680
Now, I wanted just to take the time to remind you, because it was just a complete, now you can go back to the beginning and ask what they meant when they said their little speeches which I read at the beginning.

922
01:12:51,680 --> 01:13:00,960
When he says, You see nothing when you come to Hiroshima, and she says, I've seen everything when I came to Hiroshima.

923
01:13:01,201 --> 01:13:16,561
He means you haven't seen the way Hiroshima can be reborn from the rubble into a new and happy city, taking over, paradoxically, taking over the old and turning it into some positive way of life.

924
01:13:17,361 --> 01:13:18,960
She hasn't seen that.

925
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,240
And she says, I've seen everything.

926
01:13:22,241 --> 01:13:24,240
Well, she's seen the museum four times.

927
01:13:24,241 --> 01:13:25,840
She's seen the disaster.

928
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:29,521
She's seen how many people were killed and all that.

929
01:13:29,521 --> 01:13:33,280
But she's not understood at all the new Hiroshima.

930
01:13:33,281 --> 01:13:36,320
And the same thing he says, she says, I understood everything.

931
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,960
She says, I understood everything.

932
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,960
He says, No, you didn't understand anything.

933
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:43,360
Well, this is what she didn't understand.

934
01:13:43,361 --> 01:13:53,440
She didn't understand how these people in Hiroshima could, and he anyway, could take the disaster and take it over in a positive way.

935
01:13:53,441 --> 01:14:03,000
And finally, the only thing that sort of gives it away and makes it look touristic is she says, I've always wept for Hiroshima.

936
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,361
And he said, what could you wept about?

937
01:14:04,441 --> 01:14:11,080
That's sort of a mistake, because they both weep about the same thing, namely world disaster.

938
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:15,800
But what's important is, and how neat she's done it, what a great play it is.

939
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:22,360
It turns out that he, see, from his point of view, he hasn't seen anything.

940
01:14:22,361 --> 01:14:27,240
And she hasn't understood anything because she's not a knight of faith.

941
01:14:27,241 --> 01:14:29,880
And that's the end of it.

942
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:31,321
Okay, we did it.

943
01:14:31,321 --> 01:14:31,880
We did it.
