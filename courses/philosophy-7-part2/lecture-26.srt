1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So, Dostoevsky and Nietzsche have a lot in common.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:16,720
They share a dislike and a distrust of the whole Greek tradition of rationality, philosophical detachment, theory, and science, any kind of pursuit of objective truth.

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:37,761
They think that it's okay, maybe, I mean, Nietzsche at least thinks it's okay, as science, he's got nothing against science, but as a way of life, to be detached, objective, and so forth, is indecent, degenerate, dangerous, decadent.

4
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,560
They all have sick, they all have words for it, that it's impossible really to get away with it.

5
00:00:45,201 --> 00:00:58,880
People are living things, and life they are necessarily involved in, and the attempt to get out of it is, as Socrates says in the stuff I read last time from the Twilight of the Idols.

6
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:09,840
It shows that Socrates and the Athenians have become degenerate because they can't just trust their instincts and be involved in the world anymore.

7
00:01:10,801 --> 00:02:03,160
And both of them wrote at a time when the Enlightenment, which is the whole Greek project brought up to date by Descartes and Kant, and with the Enlightenment which promised that somehow, thanks to disinterested critical reflection and reason and objectivity and science, the world would be saved from all kinds of bad things, lower immediacy like dogmatism, superstition, fanaticism, and a new enlightenment, mature human being would arise who was free and rational and in control of nature and society, master of himself and everything else, as Kant said, at last a mature and self-sufficient human being.

8
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:20,921
And Dostoevsky and Nietzsche both agree that this platonic will to truth, to objectivity, to getting the answer about everything, didn't fulfill its promise.

9
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:35,721
That instead of giving us all those goodies, it undermined meaning and commitment and made having a fulfilling life more and more difficult and finally impossible in the West.

10
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:41,080
So that's their shared take on something very wrong with our culture.

11
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,361
And remember, they wrote within a year of each other, the brothers Karamatsov and the Gay Science.

12
00:02:46,361 --> 00:02:54,440
But they differ totally on what you should do about it to resist it or reverse it, this bad change.

13
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:04,601
Dostoevsky, like Kierkegaard, thinks that Christianity, purified of Plato and the Greek influence, is what can save the culture.

14
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:11,041
Nietzsche thinks, I said this before, but it's so important to say again: Nietzsche thinks Christianity is part of the problem.

15
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:17,041
And he would say it's no accident that Augustine, for instance, merged Christianity and Plato.

16
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:29,120
They had this otherworldly view from the start, and therefore, and this wrong view, and no wonder they put them together.

17
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:47,681
We have to not only get to the root of Platonism, but to the root of Christianity and philosophy and destroy them all, Nietzsche thinks, if we're going to be able to live, he can't even say meaningful lives, you'll see why, but lives worth living.

18
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:58,560
And they both see that our culture is undermining the Greek Christian Enlightenment values.

19
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,961
And a new way of looking at things in which God doesn't play any role is on the horizon.

20
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:15,041
Dostoevsky was very sensitive to what was coming next, and he considered that a disaster, a total, a total destruction of everything.

21
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:19,281
We'll read the, I'll go back and read the relevant passages from Yvonne.

22
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:26,160
Nietzsche, which thought that somehow you had to make a virtue of what was coming along.

23
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:30,560
So, Dostoevsky, to put it finely, Dostoevsky is conservative.

24
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,200
He wants to go back to the way things were when our culture was healthy.

25
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:46,961
Nietzsche is a radical, in the sense that he wants to destroy the whole culture as it, because it was never, well, it was once, but never since the Homeric Greeks.

26
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,601
It would just been downhill ever since.

27
00:04:49,601 --> 00:05:16,760
And so, depending on whether you yourself believe and cherish this tradition in the West, which seems to be sinking, and want to save it, or whether you find it upsetting, whether you find it hopeless, and when I finish it off, that's whether you're going to be for Dostoevsky or for Nietzsche, finally.

28
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,721
And now, that's enough background.

29
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,880
I think that's just supposed to be a summary.

30
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:31,241
If anybody has anything to say about it, you can say it, but I thought I sort of said it, but I read a lot of text, and I thought maybe it was better to sum it up.

31
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:33,801
Okay, now we get on to the exciting part.

32
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:46,760
Probably the most famous and important thing that Nietzsche ever wrote, and he wrote lots of famous and important things, is The Madman, where he asserts the death of God.

33
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,401
So I don't know now, I have to find out.

34
00:05:49,401 --> 00:05:53,241
How many people have this copy, which is the one I told you to have?

35
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:55,640
How many people have some other copy?

36
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,641
Correct, great, that's good.

37
00:05:57,641 --> 00:06:02,280
That means I'm going to cite it by page numbers, not by aphorisms.

38
00:06:02,681 --> 00:06:10,121
On the handout, which I'll give you, the assignment, I'll put it in by aphorism so that people who have other, there are other translations.

39
00:06:10,361 --> 00:06:15,801
And so you can't, the aphorisms are not going to always be on the same pages.

40
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:18,121
But I'm going to give you the pages.

41
00:06:18,121 --> 00:06:21,881
And so we start with page 181.

42
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,441
And I just have to read things because it's so amazing.

43
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:36,440
So have you heard of that madman who lit a lantern in the bright morning hours and ran into the marketplace and cried incessantly, I seek God, I seek God.

44
00:06:37,121 --> 00:06:42,401
And that's well, let's go on.

45
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:48,401
As many of those who did not believe in God were standing around just then, he provoked much laughter.

46
00:06:48,401 --> 00:06:50,080
And then they say, has he got lost?

47
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,041
Is he afraid of us?

48
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,361
And they yelled and laughed.

49
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,440
And so let's stop with that.

50
00:06:55,761 --> 00:07:00,001
There's so many puzzles in this that you have to try to figure out.

51
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:06,321
So it looks like there were people standing around who didn't believe in God.

52
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,961
But on 182, he seems to say the opposite.

53
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:21,921
Because after he's been trying to convince them that God is dead, he sees that he isn't convincing them at the top of 183.

54
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:25,281
So here the madman fell silent and looked again at his listeners.

55
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:29,281
And they too were silent and stared at him in astonishment, skipping a little.

56
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:31,681
I've come too early, he said then.

57
00:07:31,681 --> 00:07:33,200
My time is not yet.

58
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,401
This tremendous event is still on the way, still wandering.

59
00:07:36,401 --> 00:07:38,881
It's not reached the ears of men.

60
00:07:38,881 --> 00:07:48,401
So he says, one, on one page, that when he tells them that God is dead, they say, okay, ho-hum, we know that already, or joke about it.

61
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:58,001
And on the next page, he says, the people in the marketplace, meaning the ordinary people, haven't a clue about this business of God being dead.

62
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,841
They don't know what he's talking about.

63
00:08:00,401 --> 00:08:03,521
The news that God is dead hasn't reached them.

64
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:11,761
So now that's a kind of clue that you better think carefully about what he means by God.

65
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:19,361
Because what's really going on is the people in the marketplace think they don't believe in God.

66
00:08:19,361 --> 00:08:24,841
They're atheists and scientists and philosophers and whatever.

67
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:30,921
And maybe ordinary people too who think they don't believe in God, but they do believe in God.

68
00:08:30,921 --> 00:08:32,761
They just don't know they do.

69
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:40,441
And so that's how the news hasn't reached them yet that God is really dead because they don't even know what God is.

70
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,681
So we have to figure out what God is.

71
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:45,560
Nietzsche tells us in other places.

72
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:49,641
The most important place is on page 283.

73
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:52,201
You've got to read this book in a weird way.

74
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:59,080
You've just got to sort of put together the story from the pieces that are scattered all over the place, or there are many different stories.

75
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:05,481
I'm telling you the story always about sort of the death of God in our culture.

76
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:21,161
And here's, and now, here's the top of 283, we find out the sense in which those people in the marketplace, even the smartest ones, the scientists, let's say, still believe in God, three lines down.

77
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:33,560
It is still a metaphysical faith upon which our faith in science rests, that even we seekers after knowledge today, we godless anti-metaphysicians, see, they all think they're godless anti-metaphysicians.

78
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:48,041
You won't find any people who are doing speculations about the supreme being in any of the science labs, at least not scientists, and maybe on the side they might be Christians or philosophers or something.

79
00:09:48,041 --> 00:10:05,801
But even the godless anti-metaphysicians, the materialists, the people who think that the science will eventually prove and control everything, are still, and now look, we godless metaphysicians still take our fire too from the flame lit by a faith that is thousands of years old.

80
00:10:05,801 --> 00:10:11,041
The Christian faith, which was also the faith of Plato, what they combined in.

81
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,560
And the faith is that God is the truth and the truth divine.

82
00:10:16,881 --> 00:10:19,281
So, what does that mean?

83
00:10:19,281 --> 00:10:36,801
Well, it means that as long as you believe that there's some right answer to the way the universe is, that there is something like objective truth, which a lot of you still do believe, although more and more really people don't, and maybe you don't.

84
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,921
But, I mean, what would it be not to believe it?

85
00:10:39,921 --> 00:10:48,801
It would believe, we'll get back to that a lot later, but it would be to believe that there are only interpretations and perspectives.

86
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:56,881
And there isn't any answer to the structure of the universe.

87
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,041
It's not just the claim that science hasn't got the answer yet or may never get the answer.

88
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:10,961
It's the claim that the idea that there's some right way of describing things because there's some objective way things really are.

89
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,481
That's the mistake.

90
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:21,841
That's what he says when he says at the end of that quote I was reading, God himself may or should, what if God should prove to be our most enduring lie?

91
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,840
What would be the enduring lie?

92
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:41,200
The enduring lie would be that there's some kind of truth and the truth is a good thing and we in our lives and in our science and philosophy and every way pursue it, believe in it because we think there is such a thing and it's valuable.

93
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,481
That's a lie.

94
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:50,721
And it's that, you see, back to 181, that the people in the marketplace aren't really atheists.

95
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,601
They just think they are.

96
00:11:52,681 --> 00:12:00,841
So those standing about who don't believe in God and laugh really do believe in God and haven't even heard the news.

97
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:09,241
You probably haven't heard the news either until you read this, that the very notion of objective truth doesn't make any sense.

98
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,401
That it's all, and you'll see later reading more of it, perspectival.

99
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:21,881
Everybody can have their own perspective, their own interpretation of the structure of things and the meaning of things.

100
00:12:21,881 --> 00:12:24,681
There's no right answer.

101
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:36,441
And that's because there's no perspective, there's no position from which to take what a philosopher these days, Tom Nagel, calls the view from nowhere.

102
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:44,121
There's only perspectives and all these contradictory perspectives and interpretations.

103
00:12:44,761 --> 00:12:49,560
And that's the news that's coming, and Nietzsche is the first to know.

104
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:55,001
And he's way ahead of his time, but it's more and more the case.

105
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,440
I mean, it's changed a lot since I've been teaching.

106
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:19,560
For instance, if you ask young scientists now, I mean, well, Einstein still believed there was one right answer to the universe, and our minds had been made by God to be adapted to understanding that structure, and that he was making progress, and that was the best thing you could do was to make progress understanding that structure.

107
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:35,161
Now, there are lots of people, when I say to scientists, my daughter, for instance, who's a chemist, and I sort of say, well, there really are electrons and galaxies, and so she looks a little worried and thinks maybe there's something wrong with me to believe that.

108
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:36,681
So that's simply like that.

109
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:40,401
Maybe this is just one big social construction.

110
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:48,641
I think she really still is a bit old guard and believes finely that there are the things she's studying.

111
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:55,681
That the more you find the younger scientists, it seems to me, I don't know, how many of you are majoring in science?

112
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:07,121
Okay, I'm just curious, how many think that science is getting it, is gradually converging and getting it right about the way the world is, independent of us and our investigation?

113
00:14:07,121 --> 00:14:08,001
Woo!

114
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:11,201
Okay, well, that's what I thought.

115
00:14:11,521 --> 00:14:17,761
I mean, I'm all for, I'm still one of the people in the marketplace who believes in science.

116
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:34,961
But Nietzsche says, and that word hasn't reached most people yet, that and what word that's on the way, namely, there isn't any objective truth about ethics.

117
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:39,201
I'm sure more of you believe that than even the science-maybe people.

118
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:45,440
I mean, is there some right answer to what is the right way to behave?

119
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:56,000
Well, the Christians think they've got an answer, and the Buddhists think they've got an answer, and Kantians have an answer, and so forth.

120
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,120
And those are all just perspectives, Nietzsche would say.

121
00:14:59,121 --> 00:15:08,881
The idea that there is one right answer about the right way to behave is just, well, I was going to say old-fashioned, but let's be more specific.

122
00:15:08,881 --> 00:15:16,000
It's something that the Greeks and Christians inspired to get everybody to believe.

123
00:15:16,321 --> 00:15:20,800
And now let's go on, because Nietzsche has a theory about why everybody believes it.

124
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,560
Do I say that?

125
00:15:27,881 --> 00:15:29,240
Well, let's see what it says.

126
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,401
At the bottom of 105.

127
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:39,720
During the last century, science has been promoted partly because it was by means of science that one hoped to understand God's goodness and wisdom best.

128
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,800
This was the main motive of the great Englishman like Newton.

129
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,881
And Einstein was still part of that.

130
00:15:45,881 --> 00:15:56,040
Partly because one believed in the absolute utility of knowledge, and especially the most intimate association of morality, knowledge, and happiness.

131
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:10,520
This is the, whether it's Aristotle or Kant or probably Hawking, who says at the end of the brief history of time that when we get science done, we'll understand the mind of God.

132
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,720
Presumably, then we'll understand why we're here and so forth.

133
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,960
That's the main motive of a great Frenchman like Voltaire.

134
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:27,800
Partly because one thought that in science one possessed and loved something unselfish, harmless, self-sufficient, truly innocent, in which man's evil impulses had no part whatever.

135
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:34,841
The main motive of Spinoza, who felt divine when attaining knowledge, in some owing to three errors.

136
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:46,120
So Nietzsche doesn't believe any of that, but he's trying to diagnose why people think the truth is a good thing and we should pursue it, because it's going to tell us how to live.

137
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:53,000
Okay, and it's going to satisfy, but we'll get to that in a little while, but I'll just say ahead.

138
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,520
I mean, it's going to give us a sense of the meaning and order of things.

139
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:07,681
And who wouldn't want to understand the meaning of all this, the usual question, why we're here and what we should be doing.

140
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,520
But it doesn't, and it can't.

141
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,040
But I want to get there the way Nietzsche gets there.

142
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:16,881
We'll get back to that in a minute.

143
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:25,520
But the first thing, we have to go back to 181 because there's, I mean, I'm trying to go through this sort of step by step.

144
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:35,600
So the second thing that the madman tells them is that second paragraph: the madman jumped into their midst and pierced them with his eyes.

145
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:37,360
Whither is God, he cried.

146
00:17:37,361 --> 00:17:40,561
I'll tell you, we have killed him, you and I.

147
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:42,240
All of us are his murderers.

148
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,000
But how did we do that?

149
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,001
How did we drink up the sea?

150
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,121
Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon?

151
00:17:49,121 --> 00:17:51,360
And so forth and so forth.

152
00:17:51,841 --> 00:17:54,801
And now there's a new interesting question.

153
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,361
How did we do that?

154
00:17:57,681 --> 00:18:01,360
Well, it's tied up to the will to truth.

155
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:20,560
Once you've got the will to truth, and if you suppose, as Nietzsche does, that there isn't any truth, then you're eventually going to find out your will to truth is eventually going to get you to find out that there isn't any and undermine itself.

156
00:18:20,561 --> 00:18:24,320
I mean, that sounds a little weird, so I have to explain it more.

157
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:33,520
So, Christianity, which is what he's talking about in the passage I'm going to read you, overcomes itself.

158
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,921
Science also overcomes itself.

159
00:18:35,921 --> 00:18:45,440
That means that by pursuing the truth relentlessly, they discover that what they believed just isn't so.

160
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,200
And now, here's what he says on 307.

161
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:59,560
You see what Triumph, middle of the page, you see what Triumphed over the Christian God, Christian morality itself, the concept of truthfulness that was understood ever more rigorously.

162
00:18:59,561 --> 00:19:09,641
The Father Confessor's refinement of the Christian conscience, translated and sublimated into a scientific conscience, into intellectual cleanliness at any price.

163
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:31,641
What he's saying is that the remember that I've mentioned this before, for the Christians, it's important that people understand their desires because they're either pure and saved or they have to transform their desires if they've got bad desires.

164
00:19:31,641 --> 00:19:41,080
But therefore, they need a science of confession to find out what people's desires are, to get people to recognize what they really desire.

165
00:19:41,081 --> 00:19:50,520
And once they recognize what they really desire, they will discover that what they really desire, they can't have.

166
00:19:51,561 --> 00:19:53,321
But now we have to jump, go on.

167
00:19:53,321 --> 00:20:07,641
So, so far, the Christians have this got more and more through confession, through philosophy and theology, into getting clearer and clearer about what people want.

168
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:39,601
So, skipping really, interpreting one's own experience now, and against any kind of self-delusion that there is some God, that there is some answer, and the problem is: if they discover that they believe that there is a God, because it would make them happier and be very satisfying and get them out of the sense that there's no guidelines in the universe, if they want to believe it, so much that they do believe it, that would be fine.

169
00:20:39,921 --> 00:20:54,081
But if they also have this will to truth, so that they can sort of see that they're believing it because they want to believe it, not because they've got any evidence for it, then the will to truth will undermine their belief.

170
00:20:54,081 --> 00:20:55,601
So, this is what he says next.

171
00:20:55,921 --> 00:21:15,200
And it sounds, it's sort of funny, if you think of Dostoevsky in the background, about 12 lines from the bottom of 307, interpreting one's own experiences as pious people have long enough interpreted theirs as if everything were providential, a hint, designed and ordained for the sake of the salvation of the soul.

172
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,320
That is all over, underlined now.

173
00:21:18,321 --> 00:21:21,040
That has man's conscience against it.

174
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:28,800
That is, you can't just interpret everything to make it look like.

175
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,561
Remember, there's always the guiding finger in Dostoevsky.

176
00:21:33,361 --> 00:21:39,921
There's the constant sense that, and the experience, oh, where did I find?

177
00:21:40,081 --> 00:21:42,480
I wonder I lost a quote, I realized.

178
00:21:43,121 --> 00:21:45,760
Maybe I've written it down and it'll show up, I hope.

179
00:21:46,081 --> 00:21:49,121
But if not, I'll just tell you, and then I'll try to find it.

180
00:21:49,121 --> 00:22:03,521
I mean, the idea that the connectedness of everything, that very important experience in the middle of the brothers, Dostoevsky has very funny things to say about that.

181
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,360
I hope I've written them down here, but if not, I'll find them anyway.

182
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,681
I don't know.

183
00:22:11,921 --> 00:22:24,281
It's a quote, I doubt if any of you remember it, where he says people shouldn't believe in little angels, and when they have religious experiences, they should be sure that they're not hungry and upset.

184
00:22:24,601 --> 00:22:30,921
And it sounds like a list of things that was wrong with Alyasha when he had that experience.

185
00:22:30,921 --> 00:22:36,121
And it's part of the, according to him, sort of a Christian duty.

186
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:45,080
to question yourself when you're having these religious experiences and making sure you're not just having sort of private psychotic experiences.

187
00:22:45,081 --> 00:22:46,120
Now, where?

188
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:47,401
Does that sound familiar?

189
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,200
Something about the voices of little angels.

190
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,440
Well, I'll bring it in next time if I don't discover it as I go on talking.

191
00:22:55,401 --> 00:22:57,801
So let's go on and we'll see what happens.

192
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,401
Unless I turn the page and find it.

193
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,720
No, there are no little angels on the page.

194
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,240
So I'm going on.

195
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:30,600
So putting aside now, well, no, I'm still continuing on the idea that because Christianity is committed to getting the truth about one's desires and one's religious experiences, they're finding out more and more that there isn't any basis for this, for that the world is the way they would like it to be.

196
00:23:30,601 --> 00:23:32,440
And so let's go on.

197
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:44,040
In our culture, and now I'm going to give some background sort of, in our culture, and uniquely in our culture, I think he thinks, we want meaning.

198
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,881
We're in the meaning business.

199
00:23:45,881 --> 00:23:48,440
We are, in a way, addicted to meaning.

200
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,280
Now, you might wonder what other cultures are different, if not meaning.

201
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:57,960
Well, I could just blurt it out ahead so you could think about it.

202
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,440
Maybe in the Homeric culture, instead of meaning, they've got wonder.

203
00:24:03,881 --> 00:24:14,320
Or Plato and the philosophers that say that philosophy begins in wonder, and Heidegger takes that, my, my guy, very seriously.

204
00:24:14,321 --> 00:24:29,921
But there could be a kind of world in which, instead of meaning, there were all kinds of sort of amazing things were happening, exciting things were happening, mind-blowing things were happening, and that would be more important than some stable meaning order.

205
00:24:29,921 --> 00:24:31,681
And maybe Bali is like that.

206
00:24:31,681 --> 00:24:46,401
I think of Bali as the place where gods are showing up all the time, and every day is a religious holiday, and it isn't a question of pursuing truth and meaning, it's sort of preserving the sacred and feeling the wonder of it.

207
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:49,121
So anyway, but our culture got into the meaning business.

208
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:52,161
So let's look at that on page 75.

209
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,121
And it isn't something that human nature just naturally has.

210
00:24:57,121 --> 00:25:03,600
It's something that our culture somehow wandered into about 15 lines from the bottom.

211
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:10,000
Human nature has been changed by the ever new appearance of these teachers of the purpose of existence.

212
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:18,881
It now is one additional need, the need for the ever new appearance of such teachers and teachers of a purpose.

213
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:28,321
Now, I can't tell, and it doesn't matter for us whether he thinks this is true of all human beings all over, even in Bali, which maybe it is, we don't know.

214
00:25:28,321 --> 00:25:34,080
What's only important is really, he thinks in the West anyway, we've gotten so.

215
00:25:34,081 --> 00:25:36,560
We've got to understand the purpose.

216
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:44,161
So he says, gradually man, I think you should just say Western men and women, and stick with that.

217
00:25:44,161 --> 00:25:53,161
Gradually, Western men and women have become fantastic animals that have a full, they have to fulfill one more condition of existence than any other animal.

218
00:25:51,361 --> 00:25:58,681
Man has to believe to know from time to time why he exists.

219
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,600
His race, no, he really wants to make it about all human beings.

220
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:04,120
What do I think?

221
00:26:05,081 --> 00:26:06,841
I think you can read it either way.

222
00:26:07,321 --> 00:26:15,800
You can read the myth of any culture as a story about how it came into existence and what the gods were trying to do and so forth.

223
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:21,081
So let's, I really think he's wrong about that, but let's give him the benefit of the doubt.

224
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:33,161
So all that is, the human race can't flourish without a periodic trust in life, without faith in reason in life.

225
00:26:33,161 --> 00:26:42,600
And again and again, the human race will decree from time to time there is something at which it is absolutely forbidden henceforth to laugh.

226
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:46,040
That's an amazingly interesting statement.

227
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:52,840
The sacred, whatever it is, is certainly that in the culture about which you can't laugh.

228
00:26:52,841 --> 00:26:58,681
And according to him, every culture has something in it that's sacred.

229
00:26:58,681 --> 00:27:00,280
That's probably true.

230
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:13,881
I mean, if you put it that way, and not that they are asking the question, why is there human existence, but that there is something whose meaning you can't question.

231
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:20,361
And it's forbidden in the way the culture is set up to laugh at it.

232
00:27:20,361 --> 00:27:27,161
Now, that sort of is fascinating in itself, but it also has a funny relation to Dostoevsky.

233
00:27:27,161 --> 00:27:28,121
Do you realize?

234
00:27:28,121 --> 00:27:29,960
And Kierkegaard.

235
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:37,921
Because this Nietzsche thing that you're forbidden to laugh at is really the same thing as the eternal in time.

236
00:27:37,921 --> 00:27:46,001
It's that those special moments who are so important to who you are or to the whole culture.

237
00:27:46,401 --> 00:27:52,881
If you want to bring in the God-man as something that happened at a special moment.

238
00:27:52,881 --> 00:28:02,720
I mean, those special moments are taken to be so definitive of what the culture is and who you are that you can't laugh at them.

239
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:09,760
And that makes me want to remind you how close that is to Dostoevsky.

240
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,081
Just sort of by accident, but he did, but it's not me, it's not that it's false.

241
00:28:14,081 --> 00:28:19,120
He really says the following thing, which I'm now going to find.

242
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:22,000
Where are we?

243
00:28:22,641 --> 00:28:24,320
728.

244
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,520
Hope I haven't got it.

245
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,121
It's something we've read already, so it shouldn't be me.

246
00:28:29,361 --> 00:28:31,760
Well, I'm not off to a good start.

247
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:37,600
Now I can't even find a thing about not laughing, which I thought I had in front of me.

248
00:28:37,601 --> 00:28:39,440
Let me catch up where I am.

249
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,120
So the culture is getting more and more addicted to meaning.

250
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,401
And, well, oh, I know.

251
00:28:46,401 --> 00:28:47,681
Why am I making such a fuss?

252
00:28:47,681 --> 00:28:48,641
I mean, we know where it is.

253
00:28:48,641 --> 00:29:04,480
It's in the very last thing, the very last pages, on 896, I would think, where he tells the boys that no matter what happens to them, they won't laugh at how they were at this moment.

254
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,161
That's what I want to find.

255
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,360
Where are we?

256
00:29:07,361 --> 00:29:11,280
We've got to find, what is it?

257
00:29:13,681 --> 00:29:17,760
Oh, at top of 8, it's on 896, but I don't see it.

258
00:29:18,081 --> 00:29:18,881
Oh, I see.

259
00:29:18,881 --> 00:29:23,800
But I assure you, boys, the man often laughs at what's good and kind.

260
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,481
That's only from thoughtlessness.

261
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:28,040
But I assure you boys that it laughs, he will say it once in his heart.

262
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,641
No, I do wrong to laugh, for that's not a thing to laugh at.

263
00:29:33,641 --> 00:29:34,840
Now, that's funny.

264
00:29:34,841 --> 00:29:37,720
That isn't the quote I had, but it's the same kind of quote.

265
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,720
Does he say it again?

266
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,721
No, maybe he doesn't say it again.

267
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,161
Well, it's a good thing you found that.

268
00:29:43,161 --> 00:29:45,240
Because I didn't even have that marked.

269
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,240
I thought I so I must have someplace else marked, but let me mark that one.

270
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,801
So it's no matter what you boys think, I'm still looking for it.

271
00:29:53,800 --> 00:30:01,080
You will look back on this moment and you won't feel cynical and you won't laugh about this moment.

272
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,800
Surely that's okay.

273
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,360
Well, the quote that whoever, who gave me that quote just now?

274
00:30:08,361 --> 00:30:09,321
Good, thanks.

275
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,600
That does it.

276
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:12,040
So let's go on.

277
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,401
Okay, there is another quote.

278
00:30:13,401 --> 00:30:14,280
We should get them both.

279
00:30:14,361 --> 00:30:15,560
895.

280
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:17,080
Together, so forth.

281
00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:18,601
Yes, let him laugh.

282
00:30:18,601 --> 00:30:19,480
Is that the same one?

283
00:30:21,161 --> 00:30:22,600
Or is there another one?

284
00:30:22,601 --> 00:30:23,241
I think.

285
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,921
Yes, yes.

286
00:30:24,921 --> 00:30:25,881
Where are you reading?

287
00:30:25,881 --> 00:30:27,320
That's what I was looking for.

288
00:30:27,321 --> 00:30:29,881
But isn't that the same one I just read?

289
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,641
Not quite.

290
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,921
Oh, yeah, here it is.

291
00:30:32,921 --> 00:30:34,201
That's the one I mark, right?

292
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,601
Dare not to laugh at having been kind and good.

293
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:37,000
Right.

294
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,600
There is something which that's a sacred memory, as he says.

295
00:30:40,601 --> 00:30:43,881
And since it's a sacred memory, you can't laugh at it.

296
00:30:43,881 --> 00:30:46,840
You can't be cynical about it and so forth.

297
00:30:46,841 --> 00:31:17,361
And so we got, our culture got addicted to meaning as that super, not just little things like these memories, but something even more meaningful, namely the Supreme Being that ordered everything in the super monotheistic way, so that everything got built into it, as he said.

298
00:31:17,361 --> 00:31:18,960
That's very important.

299
00:31:19,841 --> 00:31:24,081
So man becomes this fantastic animal that needs meaning.

300
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:31,280
And then on 279, of course, by the way, you see where the connections are.

301
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,520
I can't keep them all up in front of you at once.

302
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:46,880
But if man believes in meaning just because he needs it, because he's become that kind of creature who is a kind of meaning addict and can't live without meaning, and that's why he believes it.

303
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:59,040
Then, as he gets more and more clear about his beliefs and starts questioning whether the beliefs are justified, he will undermine the very beliefs that crop up this belief in meaning.

304
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:01,120
That's the idea he's got.

305
00:32:01,601 --> 00:32:05,361
Now, let me find where we are on 279.

306
00:32:06,561 --> 00:32:12,961
And then you get this monotheism, which is certainly not all human beings, but just the West.

307
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:21,601
But now, skipping about 15 lines down on 217, he's back to talking about the event that God has said.

308
00:32:21,601 --> 00:32:31,921
The event itself is far too great, too distant, too remote from the multitude's capacity for comprehension, even for the tidings of it to be thought of as having arrived as yet.

309
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,841
Well, that's explaining what he said on page 181.

310
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,801
Much less, and now comes the news of what will happen.

311
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:45,920
Much less may one suppose that many people know as yet what this event really means.

312
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,801
Remember, the people in the marketplace have no clue.

313
00:32:48,800 --> 00:33:00,441
And how much must collapse now that this faith has been undermined, because it was built on this faith, propped up by it, grown into it, the whole of our European morality.

314
00:33:00,441 --> 00:33:04,121
Now, that's really interesting, and there are lots of consequences.

315
00:33:04,121 --> 00:33:29,720
He sees, and I think he's right, that in this Judeo-Christian Greek world, that this monotheism with this one supreme God who created the world, who created it to be good, who gave us the ethics to go with it good, who gave us the kinds of minds to understand the structure of reality and built the structure of reality to fit it.

316
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:35,801
I think Galileo said, if reality had been like this, then God would have given us a mind that was like that.

317
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:41,960
I mean, the conviction that God set us up and the universe up so that they meshed.

318
00:33:42,601 --> 00:33:45,801
And that is what's gone.

319
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:56,601
But if that goes, or that hasn't gone yet, but that's what's going, and if that goes, then everything is going to fall apart.

320
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:59,080
Because, as I say, we've become meaning junkies.

321
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:10,200
We've become, we were, in the Middle Ages anyway, at Dante time, say 1300, we had a culture in which everything made sense.

322
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:20,200
And what we were supposed to do and why we were here and how to find out about the structure of the universe and that there was a structure and that our minds were fixed to find it out.

323
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,961
That all made sense.

324
00:34:21,961 --> 00:34:24,200
And now we can't live without it.

325
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:35,001
Now people have gotten to the point where, as he says in Twilight on 33, that people simply can't live without meaning.

326
00:34:35,001 --> 00:34:40,881
At the bottom of 33, if we possess the why of life, we can put up with almost any how.

327
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:49,921
And he says every once in a while, people would be willing to suffer if they could understand why they were here, what they were supposed to do, and all that.

328
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,481
And I think that's right.

329
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,200
And it's very interesting.

330
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:09,601
I think it's illuminating, or I wouldn't drag this in, but I have these discussions with my son, the Buddhist, in which he tells me that the meaning of everything is to get rid of suffering.

331
00:35:09,601 --> 00:35:16,961
And I tell him, no, no, if suffering is necessary to understand the meaning of everything, then you've got to put up with suffering.

332
00:35:16,961 --> 00:35:28,561
So then in a sort of way, the Buddhist seems to me, in him anyway, to come back and say the real issue is suffering and getting yourself and everything in the universe out of suffering.

333
00:35:28,561 --> 00:35:31,761
And I say, no, the real issue is meaning.

334
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,760
And we have to have meaning.

335
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,760
And if we don't have meaning, we can't stand it.

336
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,440
And we're ready to suffer.

337
00:35:39,441 --> 00:35:47,601
And if necessary, in our lives and in our culture and in our tragedies and so forth to get that meaning.

338
00:35:47,601 --> 00:35:50,720
And now Nietzsche's got a third thing.

339
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:58,161
Nietzsche thinks suffering is essential, but it isn't to give us meaning.

340
00:35:58,161 --> 00:36:03,601
Meaning we never should have got hooked on, but suffering we shouldn't try to get rid of.

341
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:07,441
So it's neither a Buddhist nor a Christian view.

342
00:36:07,441 --> 00:36:09,441
And we haven't got it yet.

343
00:36:09,441 --> 00:36:12,720
But he's got his own view, and we'll get there.

344
00:36:14,081 --> 00:36:19,841
So, in our culture, we meaning addicts will be willing to suffer if only we can get meaning.

345
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,601
But on the other hand, we're going to be able to do that.

346
00:36:22,521 --> 00:36:34,761
When religion gets good at finding out the truth about our psychology and science gets clear about psychology, they're going to find out that our craving for meaning and order isn't based on any evidence.

347
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:39,161
It's just built on all these prophets who promised it until we got addicted to it.

348
00:36:39,161 --> 00:36:43,081
And that's how religion begins to undermine itself.

349
00:36:43,081 --> 00:36:46,921
And that's why he says we have killed God.

350
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:59,640
Christianity, by being so clear about our desires, undermines our supposed reasons for believing in God by making our motives suspicious.

351
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:05,321
I mean, that's what the whole confession managed to do: be suspicious of everybody's motives.

352
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:12,040
Don't just believe every religious experience, like Dostoevsky wants us to believe Alyash's.

353
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:17,561
Look and see what circumstances led somebody to have that kind of experience.

354
00:37:17,561 --> 00:37:20,200
And that means you undermine the experience.

355
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,641
And that's what he's saying.

356
00:37:21,641 --> 00:37:31,321
So, Christianity undermines its own reasons for believing in God by examining the motives which led it to having that belief.

357
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,040
I think I've already read 307, didn't I?

358
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:34,440
Yes.

359
00:37:35,081 --> 00:37:37,720
That gets us back to 307.

360
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:40,681
Okay, now we're going to make another move.

361
00:37:40,681 --> 00:37:41,960
I mean, I could stop.

362
00:37:41,961 --> 00:37:44,281
I mean, I go on and on, and you all sit there.

363
00:37:44,601 --> 00:37:52,200
I think this must be, I hope it is, interesting and original and far out and worth thinking about.

364
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:57,240
But if somebody wants to sort of say anything, I'm ready to hear it.

365
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,040
Okay, it gets even more fun and weird and deep.

366
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:03,321
So let's go on.

367
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:33,441
The next move is that if, and this is where Nietzsche seems absolutely right, if all of our understanding of why we're here and what we're supposed to do is built into this idea that we have been created by a good, single, meaningful God, and then if we stop believing that, everything's going to collapse.

368
00:38:33,441 --> 00:38:36,161
And he's very, very clear about that.

369
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:39,601
This reign of terror that's going to hit the world.

370
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,481
And this is on 270.

371
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:44,961
He's very eloquent about it.

372
00:38:44,961 --> 00:38:47,841
That's about halfway down the page.

373
00:38:48,481 --> 00:38:50,161
So they don't know anything about the event.

374
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,681
It hasn't arrived yet.

375
00:38:51,681 --> 00:39:00,961
Much less may one suppose that many people know as yet what this event, that is the realization that God is dead, really means.

376
00:39:00,961 --> 00:39:12,320
And how much must collapse now that this faith has been undermined, because it was built upon this faith, you know, propped up by it, grown into it, the whole of our European morality.

377
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,280
I read that, I think.

378
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:34,240
But the next sentence: this long plenitude and sequence of breakdown, destruction, ruin, and cataclysm that is now impending, who could guess enough of it today to be compelled to play the teacher and proclaimer of this monstrous logic of terror, the prophet of a gloom and eclipse of the sun whose like has probably never yet occurred on earth.

379
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,761
That's just incredible.

380
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,200
Now, why would it be something that has never before occurred on earth?

381
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,720
Do you understand that?

382
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:48,961
I mean, why is our culture's collapse a much specialer kind of collapse than any other cultures?

383
00:39:48,961 --> 00:39:50,001
Because what?

384
00:39:50,320 --> 00:40:04,121
Yes, because, and one meaning, we had this monotheistic, complete story of a creator, good God, who made it all meaningful and made us a place in it and made us able to understand it and so forth.

385
00:40:04,121 --> 00:40:13,400
No other culture ever has had such a monolithic view, what Nietzsche calls monotonotheism, but you can like it.

386
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:18,681
But whether you like it or hate it like he does, the point is it's total.

387
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:29,561
And therefore, if you believe in thousands of gods, like in Japan or Bali, and a few gods turn out not to exist, it doesn't matter much.

388
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:35,561
I mean, there's plenty of other sacred places and beings and gods and so forth.

389
00:40:35,561 --> 00:40:51,881
That if you believe that there's one supreme being, and then you stop, and everything gets its meaning in terms of it, and then you stop believing in it, then you get a total collapse like nothing ever before in the history of the universe.

390
00:40:52,601 --> 00:40:55,960
It's something that had probably never yet occurred on Earth.

391
00:40:55,961 --> 00:41:06,361
You have to say probably, because maybe there's some monotheistic religion, you know, it was or asterism or something that collapsed and produced its own local total breakdown.

392
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,720
But for us, this is unique.

393
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:15,720
And now, what I want you to notice is that he calls it a cataclysm.

394
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:21,081
Does anybody recognize the surprising that he's using that word?

395
00:41:21,081 --> 00:41:23,160
I mean, it's a perfectly right word.

396
00:41:23,161 --> 00:41:31,081
A cataclysm is like a huge earthquake, I think, though my dictionary, at least in my computer, didn't tell me what a cataclysm was.

397
00:41:31,081 --> 00:41:40,081
But I think it's, and that means that the ground for everything has been shaken totally so that everything falls down.

398
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:45,681
And that's just a way to say, yes, it was all grounded in God, again, the Supreme Being.

399
00:41:45,681 --> 00:41:52,240
And when you get rid of that, it's like a huge earthquake in which everything falls down.

400
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,081
And the interesting thing is, who else calls it a cataclysm?

401
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:01,121
It's unlikely that the first dozen times you read the brothers, you would notice that.

402
00:42:01,121 --> 00:42:01,841
I didn't.

403
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,041
But look at this.

404
00:42:03,041 --> 00:42:12,401
On 751, Yvonne, the devil, is telling Yvonne about something Yvonne wrote, and what was it called?

405
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,720
The geological cataclysm.

406
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:26,720
I mean, it would make one think that maybe Dostoevsky read the brothers, except that the brothers couldn't have been around yet, when he was writing this.

407
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,561
But look what Yvonne says.

408
00:42:33,041 --> 00:42:35,761
Two-thirds of the way down on 751.

409
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:54,960
As soon as men have all denied God, and I believe that period corresponding to a geological period will come to pass, the old conception of life and the un the old conception of the universe will fall of itself without cannibalism, and what's more, the old morality and everything will begin anew.

410
00:42:54,961 --> 00:42:58,001
Now, never mind that, just for the time being, anyway.

411
00:42:58,001 --> 00:43:02,240
First, they both share, he and Yvonne, this view.

412
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,000
And then remember, I said Dostoevsky is so brilliant that he's invented Nietzsche.

413
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:09,921
And he's even the same words.

414
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,361
And now, and he makes the next move the same, but I want to go make it in Nietzsche first.

415
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:20,641
So we are told that it will be a reign of terror like nobody had ever seen before.

416
00:43:20,641 --> 00:43:32,681
Now, what's really strange is so it's a destruction of all the bedrock in which the whole world is based and everything's going to be destroyed.

417
00:43:32,681 --> 00:43:37,001
And what's the title of this section on 279?

418
00:43:37,001 --> 00:43:39,240
The meaning of our cheerfulness.

419
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,601
That's a surprise.

420
00:43:40,601 --> 00:43:47,081
That's right, the title of the section in which this is going to be a reign of terror like nobody ever saw before.

421
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,761
How can that be?

422
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:53,400
Well, you get it in Yvonne already, because Dostoevsky's inventing Nietzsche.

423
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,601
I just read it.

424
00:43:54,601 --> 00:43:58,921
It's going to turn out to be good news.

425
00:43:59,481 --> 00:44:02,200
And here's what's going to happen, according to Yvonne.

426
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:06,120
Then something, the old morality is gone and everything will begin anew.

427
00:44:06,121 --> 00:44:12,441
Men will unite to take from life all that it can give, but only for joy and happiness in the present world.

428
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:21,401
Man will be lifted up with a spirit of divine titanic pride, and the God-man will appear, extending his conquest of nature by his will and his science.

429
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,761
That's interesting.

430
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,521
That's a big difference that I never noticed before.

431
00:44:26,521 --> 00:44:34,040
Of course, Nietzsche's not going to think that science is part of the new man, but he will feel a lofty joy from hour to hour.

432
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:45,081
And then, of course, on 752, what's more, the new man may well become the God-man, even if he's the only one.

433
00:44:45,081 --> 00:44:46,600
Promoted to his new position.

434
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:51,800
I didn't quote this, but this is, of course, what Smershikov learned from Yvonne.

435
00:44:52,121 --> 00:44:57,561
He may lightheartedly overstep all the barriers of the old morality, of the old slave man.

436
00:44:59,081 --> 00:45:02,840
There is no law for God, the new God-man.

437
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,240
Where God stands, the place is holy.

438
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,520
Where I stand will become the foremost place.

439
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:09,681
All things are lawful, and that's it.

440
00:45:10,001 --> 00:45:14,720
So that's the famous Dostoevsky version of it.

441
00:45:15,681 --> 00:45:21,761
And just as for Yvonne, that it's good news, for Dostoevsky, it's good news.

442
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:34,641
And so now we have to understand why in the world this total collapse of meaning and the end of the culture into a kind of super earthquake would be something to be cheerful about.

443
00:45:34,641 --> 00:45:36,800
Well, there are clues all over.

444
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:46,401
I mean, the clue, first clue, is that the title of the book is The Gay Science, which in German, maybe it's better to translate it in another translation, the joyful wisdom.

445
00:45:47,441 --> 00:45:55,441
There's some knowledge he's imparting here, and it's a knowledge which would make you cheerful and joyful if you understand what he's telling you.

446
00:45:55,441 --> 00:45:59,281
So we go to 279.

447
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,520
Here we are, back to the meaning of our cheerfulness.

448
00:46:01,521 --> 00:46:04,240
I've read all I need to read from there.

449
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,681
So what's, and it's one more important point.

450
00:46:08,001 --> 00:46:14,401
And it's very clear that whatever he's cheerful about, it isn't because we're going to get some new meaning.

451
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,720
You can't get the old meaning back, and you can't get any new meaning in either.

452
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,481
He thinks that the universe is just plain chaos.

453
00:46:22,481 --> 00:46:24,560
There's nothing that you can say about it.

454
00:46:24,561 --> 00:46:29,841
It's just random events, sort of things bumping into each other, period.

455
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,760
So what's new?

456
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,681
You can't get the old meaning back.

457
00:46:33,681 --> 00:46:35,041
What can you get?

458
00:46:35,041 --> 00:46:40,081
Well, the bottom of 180 is beginning to tell you why you should be joyful.

459
00:46:40,081 --> 00:46:42,641
We've left the land and have embarked.

460
00:46:42,641 --> 00:46:49,440
The land is the solid land that hadn't, that was destroyed by the cataclysm.

461
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,200
We have burned our bridges behind us.

462
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:57,160
That is, everything that made sense was all interconnected and it all went down at once.

463
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,200
We have gone further and destroyed the land behind us.

464
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:05,001
That is, we destroyed the very possibility of anything having a ground or a meaning.

465
00:47:05,001 --> 00:47:06,681
Now, little ship, look out.

466
00:47:06,681 --> 00:47:08,120
Beside you is the ocean.

467
00:47:08,121 --> 00:47:13,401
To be sure, it does not always roar, and sometimes it's spread out in reveries of graciousness.

468
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:18,200
Then hours will come when you realize that it's infinite and there is nothing more awesome than infinity.

469
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:27,240
Well, that's what I'm not sure I understand those fancy words, but you can see that he's sort of substituting awesome for meaningful.

470
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,240
There is no meaning coming.

471
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:33,961
But it's exciting to have a new horizon of this sort.

472
00:47:33,961 --> 00:47:36,121
That's what we have to understand now.

473
00:47:37,081 --> 00:47:43,240
And that's, I'm now going to, I'm sort of spelling out the cheerfulness on 280.

474
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:50,521
Now you ask, what are the consequences of the total cataclysm?

475
00:47:50,521 --> 00:47:54,441
And the answer now is four lines down on 280.

476
00:47:54,441 --> 00:47:58,681
The consequences for ourselves are quite the opposite of what one might expect.

477
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:04,841
I told you, you'd think, seeing the terror, that it wouldn't be cheerful, but it is.

478
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:10,601
They are not at all sad and gloomy, but rather like a new and scarcely describable kind of light.

479
00:48:10,601 --> 00:48:15,881
Happiness, relief, exhilaration, encouragement, dawn.

480
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,720
So all kinds of good things are on that list, everything that there's any meaning.

481
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:45,040
Indeed, we philosophers and free spirits, the name for these people who have understood the cataclysm and are happy about it, when we hear the news that the old God is dead, as if, let's see, indeed, when we're free spirits, feel, when we hear the news that the old God is dead, as if a new dawn shone on us, our heart overflows with gratitude, amazement, premonitions, expectations.

482
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:52,001
This sounds like Yvonne, except for the science part in Yvonne, that it's, isn't it, everything's going to be terrific.

483
00:48:52,001 --> 00:48:57,281
And then skipping to the end, all the daring of the lover of knowledge is permitted again.

484
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,160
The sea, our sea, lies open again.

485
00:49:00,481 --> 00:49:03,200
Perhaps there has never been such an open sea.

486
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,840
Do you understand why there has never been such an open sea?

487
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,480
It's the same.

488
00:49:06,641 --> 00:49:09,681
It's the total collapse of everything at this point.

489
00:49:09,681 --> 00:49:23,200
I mean, only a monotheistic culture that builds everything into the idea of a creator god, a good creator God, if that collapses, everything collapses.

490
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:32,240
And that, again, is leaving sort of everything open to new exploration and anybody can do anything.

491
00:49:32,561 --> 00:49:34,240
Everything is lawful.

492
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:51,921
That's only possible in a culture in which everything is built into this previous order, so that if it collapses, everything goes, and there's no horizon, there's no land, there's no ground, everything's open.

493
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,401
Yeah.

494
00:49:53,121 --> 00:49:59,040
So on Payton's idea of the good, on this single person.

495
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:08,561
Well, I think he certainly thinks that that gets put pretty quickly with Augustine and the Judeo-Christian God.

496
00:50:08,561 --> 00:50:10,481
They have the same job.

497
00:50:10,481 --> 00:50:16,481
They explain the intelligibility of everything, and the moral order of everything.

498
00:50:16,481 --> 00:50:24,681
And I don't, I mean, he, he's, I read you a passage somewhere where he said Plato and Christianity in the same sentence, but I don't remember which one it was.

499
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:28,601
But they got fused because they both were totalizing.

500
00:50:29,081 --> 00:50:31,560
Plato's already a mono-something.

501
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:35,481
He's just not a monotheist because the good isn't a person.

502
00:50:35,481 --> 00:50:39,161
But it's not important whether you're a monotheist.

503
00:50:39,561 --> 00:50:52,281
It's a question of whether you believe that there's one unified, intelligible, making sense to us and guiding us order in the universe or isn't.

504
00:50:52,681 --> 00:50:54,280
Okay, anything else?

505
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,040
I'm glad somebody interrupted me.

506
00:50:56,041 --> 00:50:56,681
Yeah.

507
00:50:57,001 --> 00:50:59,321
Ah, I went over that very fast.

508
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:05,081
We could go back and look at it, but I can just tell you, that has to do with confession.

509
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,920
I did it in about one sentence.

510
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:25,320
If Christianity thinks that people's desires define who they are, then it becomes important that people confess their desires to somebody who can see through them, so to speak, because people are very good at fooling themselves and thinking they're doing good deeds when they're really doing something that benefits them and hurts somebody else and so forth.

511
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:33,321
So then you develop a whole technology of confession to get people to frankly face up to their desires.

512
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:41,641
And then you see that it's their desire for meaning that makes them interpret all events as having meaning and being significant and so forth.

513
00:51:41,641 --> 00:51:43,720
So that's the idea.

514
00:51:44,041 --> 00:51:46,921
You want to go back to it or do you remember where it is?

515
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,200
I'll read you the sentence.

516
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,480
It's the crucial one.

517
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:49,880
I don't know.

518
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,161
Let's look at 307.

519
00:51:51,161 --> 00:51:52,360
I think that must be.

520
00:51:52,601 --> 00:51:54,521
Yeah, 307.

521
00:51:54,840 --> 00:52:00,601
See, what triumphed over the Christian God is the concept of truthfulness.

522
00:52:00,601 --> 00:52:02,761
I think I may have skipped the next thing.

523
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,560
That was understood ever more rigorously.

524
00:52:05,561 --> 00:52:08,720
The father confessor's refinement of the Christian conscience.

525
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,521
No, I think I read that.

526
00:52:06,521 --> 00:52:10,800
Anyway, that's what I'm trying to explain.

527
00:52:11,121 --> 00:52:16,801
Sublimated into a scientific conscience, into intellectual cleanliness at any price.

528
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:27,121
And then interpreting one's own experience as pious people have and so forth, now everything is against it.

529
00:52:27,441 --> 00:52:32,320
And that means that we are involved in Europe's at the very end of there.

530
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:32,880
I didn't read.

531
00:52:33,121 --> 00:52:36,240
Longest and most courageous self-overcoming.

532
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,121
Self-overcoming is the next thing to talk about.

533
00:52:40,481 --> 00:52:42,080
That's where we are now.

534
00:52:43,681 --> 00:52:45,281
So we become gods.

535
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,121
That's Sivan's reaction, and that's Nietzsche's cheerfulness.

536
00:52:49,121 --> 00:52:51,601
And what is this business of overcoming?

537
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:54,641
Well, that's a new angle.

538
00:52:54,641 --> 00:52:58,080
In Nietzsche, that's why suffering is important.

539
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:16,561
What's really satisfying, what really makes life worth living, is constantly overcoming suffering, overcoming sickness, overcoming them not by getting rid of them, by being able to take them on.

540
00:53:16,561 --> 00:53:22,321
I don't know where Nietzsche says this, but somewhere he says, whatever doesn't kill me makes me stronger.

541
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,841
I think, oh, I think that's in the introduction to the gay science.

542
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,121
Let's look.

543
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:34,161
See, what's interesting about the gay science is that it's all about convalescing.

544
00:53:34,161 --> 00:53:40,641
And from starting on page 32, the whole book is about this business of overcoming.

545
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:45,361
I find where it's clear.

546
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,480
Oh, yeah, here we are.

547
00:53:46,481 --> 00:53:46,960
Okay.

548
00:53:47,601 --> 00:53:49,200
On 37.

549
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:55,161
In the end, less what is most important remain unsaid from such abysses, from such severe illness.

550
00:53:55,400 --> 00:54:08,121
See, he had been sick, and then he got well, and now he's feeling very cheerful and powerful and happy, and he's seeing the importance of being sick just for this great experience of being well.

551
00:54:08,121 --> 00:54:15,160
So you get from severe sickness, from the sickness of severe suspicion, one returns newborn.

552
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,840
That's the new man, notice.

553
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,801
It's the same thing that Dostoevsky has already picked up.

554
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:30,761
Having shed one's skin, more ticklish, more malicious, with a delicate taste for joy, with a tender tongue for all good things, merrier with seconds, innocent joy, more childlike, and so forth.

555
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,401
Nothing about meaning, but everything else.

556
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:37,321
Or skipping about 15 lines from the bottom of 37.

557
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:44,760
We convalescents still need art, but it's another kind of art, a mocking, light, fleeting, divinely untroubled, and so forth.

558
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,720
Skipping a little.

559
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:49,240
We know better afterwards what above all is needed for this.

560
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,120
Cheerfulness.

561
00:54:50,121 --> 00:54:51,881
Any cheerfulness, my friend.

562
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,760
And that's cheerfulness, remember, is why we are cheerful.

563
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:55,561
We're back today.

564
00:54:55,561 --> 00:54:58,921
So he starts that way at the very beginning.

565
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:05,081
And I bet in here somewhere is what doesn't kill me, makes me stronger, but I don't think I can flip to it.

566
00:55:05,081 --> 00:55:08,041
And it may be some other place that Nietzsche says that.

567
00:55:08,041 --> 00:55:08,681
Yeah.

568
00:55:09,001 --> 00:55:12,441
If you said it in here, I probably would have underlined it.

569
00:55:14,681 --> 00:55:20,361
So now you're going to tell us about the great health, what you've got.

570
00:55:20,681 --> 00:55:26,200
And now you understand, Nietzsche has such an interesting, complicated picture.

571
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,561
You understand that the culture has been sick.

572
00:55:29,561 --> 00:55:38,561
And the culture has now, once they get rid of God and monotheism, they'll get over this sickness and they'll be convalescent.

573
00:55:38,561 --> 00:55:39,761
And that's good.

574
00:55:40,161 --> 00:55:42,161
That's what he calls the great health.

575
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:43,520
That's the great overcoming.

576
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:59,361
It was even worth the culture going through all this bad stuff in order to be able to experience this wonderful thing of being new.

577
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:03,761
Okay, so on 346, the great health.

578
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,561
Being new, nameless, hard to understand.

579
00:56:06,561 --> 00:56:18,080
We premature births of a yet unproven future, yet for a new goal, also a new means, a new health, stronger, more seasoned, tougher, more audacious, and gayer than any previous health.

580
00:56:18,081 --> 00:56:20,881
I mean, that's the same word as in the gay science.

581
00:56:21,521 --> 00:56:23,600
And let me skip a little.

582
00:56:23,601 --> 00:56:44,720
And so, skipping to the next paragraph: and now, after we've long been on our way in this manner, we argonauts of the ideal, with more daring perhaps than is prudent, and have suffered shipwreck and damage often enough, that we are, to repeat it, healthier than one likes to permit us, dangerously healthy, ever again healthy.

583
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,880
It seems to us as if it was a reward.

584
00:56:50,961 --> 00:57:00,001
It seems to us as if, as a reward, we now confronted an as yet undiscovered country whose boundaries nobody has surveyed yet.

585
00:57:00,001 --> 00:57:02,561
That's again like the ocean with no horizon.

586
00:57:02,561 --> 00:57:05,921
Something beyond all the lands and nooks of the ideal so far.

587
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,720
A world so overrich.

588
00:57:07,441 --> 00:57:11,361
Now, now notice, no meaning, but something else which I'm calling wonder.

589
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:21,121
A world so rich in what is beautiful, strange, questionable, terrible, and divine that our curiosity as well as our craving to possess it has got beside itself.

590
00:57:21,121 --> 00:57:24,361
Alas, now nothing will save us anymore.

591
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:27,880
So that's his new substitute for how to live.

592
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:36,281
You live in this constant getting reborn and having the joy of being reborn.

593
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:41,481
And that means then that, as I said, sickness is a good thing.

594
00:57:41,481 --> 00:57:51,161
Sickness is necessary because you couldn't get reborn if you didn't sort of die in your old diseases.

595
00:57:51,161 --> 00:57:55,001
This is on way back at the beginning, on page six.

596
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:01,240
See, he's setting all this up at the beginning with his convalescence.

597
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,240
But I don't find page 30.

598
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,561
All I get is the translator's introduction.

599
00:58:05,561 --> 00:58:07,321
I think I must have made a mistake.

600
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,840
Maybe there is no page.

601
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,280
Well, let's look for aphorism.

602
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:10,681
No?

603
00:58:10,681 --> 00:58:12,041
Okay, I have to find that.

604
00:58:12,041 --> 00:58:15,960
What else did I have to find that I didn't find that I promised I would find?

605
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,720
Somebody remember?

606
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:19,240
You remember?

607
00:58:19,561 --> 00:58:22,601
Oh, yeah, the little angels and being hungry.

608
00:58:22,601 --> 00:58:29,481
And you have to be very careful when you're having a religious experience that you're not just having a psychotic breakdown.

609
00:58:29,481 --> 00:58:31,240
Okay, well, I'll find that.

610
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:33,400
So the sickness is necessary.

611
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,681
I don't know where.

612
00:58:34,681 --> 00:58:39,401
And now we get to the fact that life is constant overcoming.

613
00:58:39,961 --> 00:58:45,161
Finally, he tells you what he thinks the meaning of it all is.

614
00:58:45,161 --> 00:58:56,121
It's a peculiar kind of meaning of it all because it's the meaning of it all doesn't give you any meaning, but it gives you this wonder.

615
00:58:56,121 --> 00:58:57,880
And why is that happening?

616
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,641
And why is that important?

617
00:58:59,641 --> 00:59:11,520
Well, I'm trying to find something, which I okay, so now it's got to do with life is constant overcoming.

618
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:14,481
So you've got to look now at 290 and 291.

619
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:21,601
It turns out that there is sort of a basic truth about the universe after all.

620
00:59:21,601 --> 00:59:39,921
Not a meaning, not a structure, not any moral guidelines, but that just being alive means being constantly outgrowing whatever it is you are and think you are and are doing and taking on new identities, new projects, new worlds.

621
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,081
That's what it is to be alive.

622
00:59:42,561 --> 00:59:58,161
So you find at the bottom of 291, the wish to preserve oneself is a symptom of distress, of a limitation of the really fundamental instinct of life, which aims at the expansion of power.

623
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:01,040
So that's what life is.

624
01:00:01,041 --> 01:00:03,681
Life aims at the expansion of power.

625
01:00:03,681 --> 01:00:06,080
It is constantly overcoming.

626
01:00:06,161 --> 01:00:23,601
At the bottom of the next, on 292, with the big paragraph, the bottom of it, the great and small struggle always resolves around superiority, around growth and expansion, around power, in accordance with the will to power, which is the will of life.

627
01:00:23,601 --> 01:00:27,921
The will to power is that last unfinished book he was writing.

628
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,560
And this is the middle of 292.

629
01:00:31,121 --> 01:00:34,080
This is really his view.

630
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:42,401
And I wanted to another quote that says that this wonder where it is.

631
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,601
I'll write that down too.

632
01:00:43,601 --> 01:00:45,041
I owe you three now.

633
01:00:45,521 --> 01:00:47,601
Sickness is necessary.

634
01:00:47,601 --> 01:00:50,561
Keep an eye on your religious experiences.

635
01:00:50,561 --> 01:00:52,360
Life is overcoming.

636
01:00:52,681 --> 01:00:59,240
I mean, he says that in the passages I just read you, but there's a place where he says it more directly.

637
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,001
And I don't know where that is.

638
01:01:01,001 --> 01:01:01,561
Okay.

639
01:01:01,561 --> 01:01:03,720
So I've got one more thing to say then.

640
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:06,360
And nobody else are there any say?

641
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,920
Well, I just have one more piece in this.

642
01:01:09,561 --> 01:01:16,440
So now we've gotten, just let me say again, the fact that everything collapsed is a wonderful thing.

643
01:01:16,521 --> 01:01:32,601
Turns out that our culture is the best culture because it manages to build this amazing monolithic monotheism and collapse it, and therefore has a kind of the biggest amount of overcoming that any culture ever had.

644
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:47,240
It's going to have to overcome everything that it believed before and start over again, and it'll have a wonderful convalescence, and everything will be wonderful and new and beautiful, just like Yvonne was talking about.

645
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,561
And so what will people do?

646
01:01:49,561 --> 01:02:03,321
Well, there's lots of talk about what people will do, but I just want to read two of them, partly because sometimes I read things because they're related to breathless.

647
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:10,441
And so this is things that you need to have noticed when you see breathless.

648
01:02:10,441 --> 01:02:19,641
So on 258, you won't know really right now why I'm reading you this, but you will maybe know when you see the movie.

649
01:02:19,641 --> 01:02:28,040
So at the top of 258, surely the faith, he wants to say that you should lead a life of egoism, as he calls it.

650
01:02:28,041 --> 01:02:39,840
After all, if what you're trying to do is sort of overcome yourself and everybody else and your circumstances and increase your power, then you are not going to want to be timid.

651
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,160
You're not going to be turning the other cheek.

652
01:02:42,641 --> 01:02:44,480
I'll say this way ahead of time.

653
01:02:44,481 --> 01:02:47,200
Somebody asked me sort of what he says about Jesus.

654
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:54,240
Jesus has lots of important affinities with this business of opening up a new world, according to him.

655
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,000
So he likes Jesus.

656
01:02:56,001 --> 01:02:58,881
I think he thinks Jesus only made one mistake.

657
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,881
He was against egoism.

658
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,561
He was for the meek.

659
01:03:02,561 --> 01:03:06,560
Nietzsche has nothing good to say for the meek.

660
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,720
He's all for the strong.

661
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,280
He goes with expansion and life and so forth.

662
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:26,400
So at the top of 258, surely the faith preached so stubbornly with so much conviction that egoism is reprehensible has on the whole harmed egoism while benefiting, as I shall repeat a hundred times, the herd instincts.

663
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,921
Those are the sort of people that let you walk all over them.

664
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:36,801
Above all, by depriving egoism of its good conscience and bidding us to find in it the true source of all unhappiness.

665
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:49,841
Your selfishness is a misfortune of your life that was preached for thousands of years and harmed, as I have said, selfishness and deprived it of much spirit, much cheerfulness, much sensibility, much beauty.

666
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:53,120
It has made selfishness stupid and ugly and poisoned.

667
01:03:53,121 --> 01:04:01,601
Now, when you see the movie, ask yourself who represents the kind of egoist that he admires.

668
01:04:01,601 --> 01:04:03,681
And now, just one more.

669
01:04:03,681 --> 01:04:13,601
I'm just sort of building a case so that when we're going to see, remember, I'm going to do all the Nietzsche, and then we're going to see Breathless, and then we're going to discuss Breathless, and then there's going to be one final lecture.

670
01:04:13,561 --> 01:04:16,200
But so, lots of things that we're reading.

671
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,720
It's going to help you when you see Breathless.

672
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:23,880
But if somebody asked me, why do I think that Breathless is a Nietzschean movie?

673
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:25,880
There are lots of little hints.

674
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:34,761
But the most important one is a poster on the wall at one point that reads, live dangerously.

675
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,441
And this is what he's talking about on 228.

676
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:41,720
Ah, I haven't read 228, have I?

677
01:04:42,041 --> 01:04:45,160
Because I'm going to read something I didn't realize.

678
01:04:45,161 --> 01:04:49,801
It's got another one of those overcoming passages which are important, about 10 lines down.

679
01:04:49,800 --> 01:05:00,121
We now need many preparatory, courageous human beings who cannot very well leap out of nothing any more than out of the sand and slime of present-day civilization and metropolitanism.

680
01:05:00,121 --> 01:05:03,081
Human beings who know how to be silent, lonely.

681
01:05:03,081 --> 01:05:04,280
This is not about breathless.

682
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:05,561
This is about overcoming.

683
01:05:05,561 --> 01:05:09,320
Human beings that know who to be silent.

684
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:21,080
This is really about Nietzsche, who lived all by himself in a cabin up in the high Alps, where he, and you can understand how you could think very clearly on bright, cold days.

685
01:05:21,081 --> 01:05:31,720
He could think very clearly when it was, and he loved to be walking around in the high Alps and living in his little cabin up there.

686
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:39,400
And so, and we need people who can be silent, lonely, resolute, and content, and constant in invisible activities.

687
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:43,560
Human beings who are bent on seeking all things for what in them must be overcome.

688
01:05:43,561 --> 01:05:45,481
See, that's what he thinks he's doing.

689
01:05:45,481 --> 01:05:49,720
Human beings distinguished by, look at that again, cheerfulness.

690
01:05:49,720 --> 01:06:06,601
Cheerfulness is such an among all these terms like bliss and joy and what are other ones, fulfillment, those are all too meaning-laden and too Christian or Greek.

691
01:06:07,281 --> 01:06:15,280
He's got his own sort of strange kind of happiness, which is he calls cheerfulness.

692
01:06:15,281 --> 01:06:17,681
Yeah, I know, I know, I'm about to get there, but thanks.

693
01:06:17,681 --> 01:06:20,080
Yeah, I saw that other quote I wanted to say.

694
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:25,040
Now I'm saving this one until the last time, time is just running out, but we have time to read it.

695
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:36,400
So here's the quote, a piece of which appears on the wall in the background in Breathless, about ten lines from the bottom of 228.

696
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:40,000
More endangered human beings, more fruitful human beings.

697
01:06:40,321 --> 01:06:41,760
How do I begin there?

698
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:54,481
Okay, I will start with, for believe me, the secret for harvesting from existence the greatest fruitfulness and the greatest enjoyment is to live dangerously underline.

699
01:06:54,481 --> 01:07:07,040
Build your cities on the slopes of Vesuvius, send your ships into uncharted seas, live at war with your peers and yourselves, be robbers and conquerors as long as you cannot be rulers and possessors.

700
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:12,160
That's sort of the epigraph that you could put over Breathless.

701
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,880
And we can stop with that.

702
01:07:15,441 --> 01:07:21,681
We'll go on and you just do the reading and I will comment on it as we go.
