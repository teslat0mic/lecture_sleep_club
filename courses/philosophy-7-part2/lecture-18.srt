1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,041
We have want to look at the answers to the Grand Inquisitor.

2
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:08,080
All we've got so far is the antinomies.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:21,120
And we know that the two alternatives, the Protestant and the Catholic, the Grand Inquisitor, the Catholic, and Jesus, the Protestant, are equally bad.

4
00:00:22,561 --> 00:00:40,161
One of them has a view that human beings are hopeless, slavish, and awful, and the other one has the view that human beings are totally free and capable of completely austere dedication, like Kierkegaard.

5
00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:45,120
And the Russian Orthodox Zosima's view, we really don't know yet.

6
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,680
So we're going to run through them now and look for the third view.

7
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:53,680
You should have been looking for it, and I hope some of you know it.

8
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,200
And well, of course, the chart helps, but the chart is pretty cryptic.

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,600
So, anyway, we will do the third view.

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,920
Some of the third view is in the sayings of Father Zosima.

11
00:01:03,921 --> 00:01:11,080
That's where, in his letter, Dostoevsky says there is this oblique answer to the Grand Inquisitor.

12
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:27,960
But the crucial, two of the most crucial ones, there are so many of them, all of these existentializing moves, that two of the crucial answers to the specific antinomies of the Grand Inquisitor are over the issue of confession and miracle.

13
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,400
And I don't know whether you're going to get to miracle today, but I'm going to try.

14
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:40,200
That's why I sent around a message that you should all read through the passage on miracle so that if we get there, you'll know what's happening and how exciting it is.

15
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:46,280
I have a feeling we may not, because it turns out I have to leave about 10 minutes early today and rush out of here.

16
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,521
But let's go and see where we end up.

17
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:56,760
So let's look first at what I think is, as I say, the least interesting of them, but we've got to start where we start.

18
00:01:56,761 --> 00:02:01,880
Do people need material satisfaction in order to lead good lives and be moral?

19
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,280
And how much material satisfaction?

20
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:24,280
On one side of the antinomy, you get the extreme ascetic view attributed to Jesus, and on the other side, we get the sort of, we indulge people because we know they're weak and we want to make them happy, a view of the Grand Inquisitor.

21
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:42,040
So the first is to see evidence outside of the dialectic, that is the give and take of the antinomies, independent evidence that Dostoevsky rejects the Jesus story and rejects the Grand Inquisitor story.

22
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:46,120
We have to see that before we can see the positive thing he's proposing.

23
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:58,081
Well, the way to find out is to ask yourself questions like this: Is there anybody in the book who is the kind of religious person that the Grand Inquisitor says Jesus wants?

24
00:02:58,081 --> 00:03:04,801
The kind that can give up bread and simply live on mushrooms and locusts and berries.

25
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:08,880
Anybody know who that is, or if there is such a one?

26
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,521
Yeah.

27
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:11,361
Have we done this already?

28
00:03:11,361 --> 00:03:11,761
No?

29
00:03:11,761 --> 00:03:12,081
Okay.

30
00:03:12,081 --> 00:03:14,960
I suddenly thought, gee, maybe we've already discussed.

31
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:25,440
Okay, yes, Father Farrapont on 190 is the sort of reductio to craziness of the Jesus view.

32
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,481
He says at the top, yes, I can give up their bread, not needing it, and live on mushrooms and berries.

33
00:03:30,481 --> 00:03:31,841
They can't give up their bread.

34
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:33,521
They are in bondage to the devil.

35
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,481
The unclean deny that there is need for such fasting.

36
00:03:36,481 --> 00:03:38,880
Haughty and unclean is their judgment.

37
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,520
And then, and you wonder, well, maybe he's right.

38
00:03:41,520 --> 00:04:00,000
Well, then at the bottom, you hear him tell this story about this devil, which he could see through, and he saw the devil hiding behind the door, a big one, tail a yard long, and he slammed the door on the tail, and the devil squealed, and he made the sign of the cross over him, and he died on the spot.

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,600
And what do you think?

40
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:04,000
I think it shows that he's completely insane.

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,520
And I think that's the general view that people have.

42
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,921
Some think he's sort of holy, and that is H-O-L, well, wholly insane.

43
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:15,120
I think he's holy, I guess, with a W, totally insane.

44
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:28,241
There's not a sign that he understands, that he makes any sense, and he's the big enemy of Father Zosima, and you would expect sort of the enemy, we aren't going to be likely to like the enemy of Father Zosima.

45
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:41,880
But then, is there any evidence that it's okay not only to eat bread and not to sort of starve yourself, but it's even okay to eat goodies?

46
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:54,680
I mean, what's the equivalent of, I mean, what I think of as the equivalent of hot fudge sundaes and banana splits in this book, something that people really like, and it isn't good for them, but they can't resist it.

47
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,041
Yes, cherry jam.

48
00:04:56,041 --> 00:05:04,921
Don't ask me why, but cherry jam is the thing that both Father Zosima and Alyasha will die for.

49
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:11,320
About a third of the way down on 258, Ivan asks Alyasha, do you want soup?

50
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,921
And he says, Yeah, and he says, and cherry jam, they have it here.

51
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:18,281
And then Alyasha says, Let me have jam too.

52
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:19,161
I still like it.

53
00:05:19,161 --> 00:05:21,720
So he gets his cherry jam.

54
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:25,080
And more important, Zosima, I had it marked here.

55
00:05:25,081 --> 00:05:26,281
I don't see it now.

56
00:05:26,281 --> 00:05:28,440
Zosima also gets cherry jam.

57
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,281
The ladies bring it to him.

58
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,801
Where is that?

59
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:32,680
I don't know yet.

60
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,080
I lost it just a second.

61
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:36,841
Hmm.

62
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:38,200
Anybody know?

63
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I have it written here.

64
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,041
It's 383.

65
00:05:44,361 --> 00:05:57,641
This just shows you what we're looking at is Dostoevsky obviously thinks that fasting is not necessary except on special occasions and that you can indulge yourself in good things as long as you don't get addicted to them.

66
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,601
We'll get to that.

67
00:05:58,601 --> 00:06:04,841
But at the bottom of 382, they are complaining about the Zosima.

68
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:11,000
He was not strict in fasting, allowed himself sweet things, ate cherry jam with his tea.

69
00:06:11,801 --> 00:06:15,000
That's interesting, and it's important.

70
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:24,120
That is, he's clearly a spiritual, moral, pure, joyful person.

71
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,840
It is.

72
00:06:25,841 --> 00:06:30,561
And spiritual, moral, pure, joyful person, Father Ferrapant.

73
00:06:25,081 --> 00:06:32,560
Farrapont certainly is not.

74
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,801
He's always in a grumpy mood.

75
00:06:34,801 --> 00:06:36,401
He's always denouncing everybody.

76
00:06:36,401 --> 00:06:38,720
He always says he's better than everybody.

77
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:49,120
So it looks like score one for against, score against the Jesus view that you should be an ascetic like Ferrapont.

78
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,841
And now we have to talk about the other side.

79
00:06:53,921 --> 00:06:58,880
We've got evidence now that people need bread and they need even goodies.

80
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,361
But there's also evidence that they need bread.

81
00:07:01,361 --> 00:07:03,041
I mean, I should have done it in the other order.

82
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,680
Put it in your notes in the right order.

83
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,000
We want to see, one, that they need bread and shouldn't be starving themselves.

84
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,881
And two, they even can have hot-fudge Sundays.

85
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,361
And that's all right.

86
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:23,760
So let's, here's the evidence that they need food and just plain old food and shouldn't be fasting all the time.

87
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,281
Where is it?

88
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,440
The bottom of 332.

89
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:38,560
Friends and teachers, I've heard more than once, and of late one may hear it more often, that the priests and above all the village priests are complaining on all sides of their miserable income and their humiliating lot.

90
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:53,841
They state and so forth that because of the smallness of their means, if Lutherans and heretics come, you know, these dangerous Lutherans are prowling around on the periphery of the Russian Orthodox Church.

91
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,081
If the Lutherans and heretics come and lead the flock astray, they let them because they have so little to live on.

92
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:02,241
May the Lord increase their sustenance.

93
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:05,120
It's so precious to them, for their complaint is just.

94
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,961
Their sustenance is their food.

95
00:08:06,961 --> 00:08:11,960
And Zosima is saying, the priests say they're too hungry to go around doing their priest's job.

96
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:13,560
And Zosima says it's true.

97
00:08:10,081 --> 00:08:14,760
We've got to get them more food.

98
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:18,601
How we're going to get them more food, we're not ready to say yet.

99
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,801
But he thinks the monks' complaint is just.

100
00:08:23,081 --> 00:08:28,601
And now you get the cherry jam, that they ought to also have goodies.

101
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:44,920
But what they shouldn't do is cultivate their appetites beyond what they are and need to be, and get addicted just to trying to increase their desires and satisfy them.

102
00:08:45,961 --> 00:08:48,040
I call that the Berkeley approach.

103
00:08:49,241 --> 00:09:00,120
The Berkeley approach of learning to love all sorts of delicious and pleasant and wonderful things and being able to increase your desires for things you never even knew you wanted.

104
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:02,280
That's what people do around here.

105
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,161
That's what the Grand Inquisitor is very much against.

106
00:09:05,481 --> 00:09:07,481
The bottom of 359.

107
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:10,601
The world has proclaimed the reign of freedom, especially of late.

108
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,880
What do you see in this freedom?

109
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,041
Nothing but slavery and self-destruction.

110
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,241
Because the world says, wherever it says world, you say Berkeley.

111
00:09:17,241 --> 00:09:22,200
You have desires and so satisfy them, for you have the same rights as the most rich and powerful.

112
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:25,561
Don't be afraid of satisfying them and even multiply your desires.

113
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,801
That's the modern doctrine of the world.

114
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:34,601
They think that in that they see freedom, which is, but it's not really freedom.

115
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,081
And what's the middle ground?

116
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:42,441
Well, it's sort of implied in there, to begin with.

117
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:48,441
You eat enough food to be able to lead a comfortable life and do the job that you are called to do.

118
00:09:48,601 --> 00:09:54,801
And you can even have some goodies, but you don't get addicted to satisfying all your desires.

119
00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:00,640
You cut off your superfluous and unnecessary desires, except maybe for cherry jam.

120
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,841
I mean, it's a kind of nice, I mean, it sounds sort of inconsistent, but it's just a kind of flexible, sensible view.

121
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:16,560
I mean, you don't have to cut off all your unnecessary desires, but only if you don't, but you can't let them get enslave you.

122
00:10:16,561 --> 00:10:21,041
If you become addicted to smoking, for instance, then you've gone too far.

123
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,000
And if you became addicted to cherry jam, that wouldn't be good either.

124
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,960
But if you can enjoy them, this is all talked about on 360 at the about 20 lines from the bottom.

125
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:33,040
For how can a man shake off his habits?

126
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:39,201
What can become of him if he's in bondage to the habit of satisfying the innumerable desires he's created for himself?

127
00:10:39,201 --> 00:10:44,721
And then below that, next paragraph, the monastic way is very different.

128
00:10:44,721 --> 00:10:47,201
Obedient, fasting, and prayer are laughed at.

129
00:10:47,201 --> 00:10:50,241
Yet only through them lies the way to real true freedom.

130
00:10:50,241 --> 00:10:54,400
I cut off my superfluous and unnecessary desires.

131
00:10:54,721 --> 00:11:04,561
So a little skipping to the bottom, which is most capable, see, who's most capable of conceiving a great idea and serving it?

132
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,801
The rich man in his isolation, or the man who has freed himself from the tyranny of material things and habits.

133
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,161
So that's a sensible view.

134
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,400
It's so sensible that it's not very exciting.

135
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:24,481
I mean, it's more fun if you, as you'll see, you get far-out views like Dostoevsky's views about confession and miracles.

136
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:25,760
But we have to follow this.

137
00:11:26,081 --> 00:11:28,401
And what does Osima think you should do?

138
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,721
Would there be a necessary amount of bread without a planned economy?

139
00:11:32,721 --> 00:11:33,680
Remember the issue.

140
00:11:33,681 --> 00:11:38,801
I mean, suppose all you need to do is get bread for people.

141
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:53,161
Maybe there's not enough bread to go around, unless you plan from each according to his ability to each according to his need and have a kind of Soviet communism, which he's sort of predicting.

142
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,481
Without that, there won't be enough bread.

143
00:11:55,481 --> 00:12:00,841
Well, Dasima's view is sort of interesting, but I don't know whether it works.

144
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,401
He thinks you don't need one big planned economy.

145
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,321
What you need is lots of, in effect, hippie communes.

146
00:12:09,321 --> 00:12:18,281
People who live together and share things and love each other and eat a reasonable amount that don't cultivate their desires and aren't selfish.

147
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:31,721
And they, thousands, hundreds of thousands of kibbutzes or hippie communes or whatever you want to call them, they will be the sort of economic backbone, and then everything will be all right.

148
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,800
This was sort of in the 60s when I was teaching that here.

149
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:44,761
This was much more relevant because the hippies were going off to Oregon and Washington and setting up such communes in which they would share everything and all love each other.

150
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,601
And it looks like an argument against Dostoevsky that, as far as I know, they've all failed.

151
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:52,841
I don't, maybe you know more about it than I do.

152
00:12:52,841 --> 00:12:53,321
Yeah.

153
00:12:54,681 --> 00:12:55,161
What?

154
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,640
Well, a cooperative is different.

155
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,160
The students don't own all their goods in common, do they?

156
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,280
Their clothes and their oh, okay.

157
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,081
But anyway, and if it works, they're good.

158
00:13:07,081 --> 00:13:08,441
And I gather it works still.

159
00:13:08,441 --> 00:13:09,960
There are still kibbutzes in Israel.

160
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:10,601
Anybody know?

161
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:11,880
That's what I think.

162
00:13:12,841 --> 00:13:23,961
But it's not, let me just say, Dostoevsky, I think, would have to admit that it's not working well enough to be the general form of the economy and to solve everybody's problems.

163
00:13:23,961 --> 00:13:25,760
Now, that's not just me saying that.

164
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,040
That wouldn't be interesting.

165
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,440
Dostoevsky thinks it's not going to work.

166
00:13:25,081 --> 00:13:30,320
That's what's interesting.

167
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,601
He's really criticizing Zosima on this one.

168
00:13:33,601 --> 00:13:42,641
Zosima thinks there should be this local communes and everybody will just love each other and help each other.

169
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,241
He says it in terms of the priests on 334, those priests who don't have enough food.

170
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:50,001
What are you going to do about that?

171
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:58,241
And he says to the priests, 12 lines from the bottom, you will penetrate their hearts with these simple tales.

172
00:13:58,241 --> 00:14:00,081
He says, tell them the Bible stories.

173
00:14:00,081 --> 00:14:03,761
Give one hour a week to it, in spite of your poverty, only a short hour.

174
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:13,041
And you will see for yourself that our people are gracious and grateful and that we will pay you a hundredfold, mindful of the kindness of their priests and the moving words they have heard from him.

175
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:20,641
They will, of their own accord, help him in the fields and in his house and treat him with more respect, and so will increase his worldly well-being.

176
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:25,441
So, in a way, everybody's sort of helping, and so maybe the Amish have this too.

177
00:14:25,441 --> 00:14:29,361
I mean, it's something that it's an interesting proposal.

178
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:36,961
And what's really surprising and interesting to me is that Dostoevsky doesn't buy it.

179
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:51,201
You might think, if you say to Dostoevsky, if you say to Zosima, this is too idealistic, people are innately selfish, they won't want to share the fruit of their hard labor and their clothes and their books and so forth.

180
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,921
Most of these communes didn't last.

181
00:14:53,921 --> 00:14:54,721
And what would that be?

182
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,521
Would that be an objection to Dostoevsky?

183
00:14:57,841 --> 00:15:00,480
Well, interestingly enough, no.

184
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,681
He differs from Zosima on this one.

185
00:15:03,681 --> 00:15:15,801
He thinks people are really selfish and that it basically you're not going to be able to set up this kind of shared commune-like world.

186
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,880
You don't get it said clearly until 347.

187
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:27,320
It's very important to Dostoevsky's view that ordinary human beings are Hobbesian.

188
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:39,161
Hobbes is a philosopher who's famous for saying life is nasty, brutish, and short, and that everybody tries to get as much possessions as possible and then has to sort of guard their possessions against everybody else.

189
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,400
And that's why we have government.

190
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:44,921
So Dostoevsky has a similar view.

191
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:51,161
He says at the bottom of 346, well, it's presented sort of backwards.

192
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,241
So let me do it on 347.

193
00:15:53,241 --> 00:15:55,241
Here he's telling you what's wrong.

194
00:15:55,241 --> 00:16:03,961
This is the mysterious visitor, who we'll hear more about, who comes to talk to who Zosima knows a lot about.

195
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:07,561
The mysterious visitor knows a lot about human nature.

196
00:16:07,561 --> 00:16:08,841
Here's what he says.

197
00:16:08,841 --> 00:16:13,000
The second sentence in the first big paragraph, 1347.

198
00:16:13,321 --> 00:16:16,040
For everyone strives to keep his individuality.

199
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,961
Everyone wants to secure the greatest possible fullness of life for himself.

200
00:16:19,961 --> 00:16:27,000
But in the meantime, all his efforts result in attaining, well, not in attaining fullness of life, but self-destruction.

201
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,320
For instead of self-realization, he ends by arriving in complete solitude.

202
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,361
All mankind in our age is split up into units.

203
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,600
Man keeps apart, each in his own groove.

204
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,840
Each one holds aloof, skipping a little.

205
00:16:38,921 --> 00:16:40,840
He ends up repelled by others.

206
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,520
And this is the Hobbesian thing.

207
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:48,040
He heaps up riches by himself and thinks how strong I am now and how secure.

208
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:53,721
And in his madness, he does not understand that the more he heaps up, the more he sinks into self-destructive impotence.

209
00:16:53,721 --> 00:17:01,681
Namely, he can't really defend himself and his possessions against everybody else who wants to get his possessions to add to their possessions.

210
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,760
Now, what's going on?

211
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,880
I mean, it's odd when you find a kind of conflict between Zosima and Dostoevsky.

212
00:17:08,881 --> 00:17:13,201
Of course, you could say Dostoevsky doesn't agree with the mysterious visitor, but he does.

213
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:17,520
I mean, I can't sort of quote you any line, but keep your eyes open.

214
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,800
The story is this: it's another existentialized.

215
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:28,961
The original sin, when existentialized, is that people are naturally selfish and insecure.

216
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:42,481
And if you just take people the way they naturally are, you can't build a commune and a successful state on the basis of them.

217
00:17:42,481 --> 00:17:48,320
And original sin just is the way everybody is selfish, basically, and insecure.

218
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,840
And what do you do then?

219
00:17:50,161 --> 00:18:07,680
Well, in some way, which is way later in the book, you have to understand how people can be transformed by existentialized Christian love so that they stop being selfish and insecure.

220
00:18:07,681 --> 00:18:09,361
We may get there today.

221
00:18:09,681 --> 00:18:11,120
It happens to Grushenka.

222
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,760
He told you to be sure and read for today.

223
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,681
Maybe we should just mention.

224
00:18:15,681 --> 00:18:17,921
I mean, Grushenka is.

225
00:18:17,921 --> 00:18:22,160
How many read the passage I told you to read for today in the email?

226
00:18:22,161 --> 00:18:28,241
Okay, thanks to you all and congratulations, but not enough that I want to skip ahead to Grushenka.

227
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,600
But you may understand what I'm saying.

228
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:52,600
But anyway, the idea is that Dostoevsky's idea, Dezova is living in this too protected way in his monastery, not really, and there they share lots of things, and they're very special people, and they all love each other, and they all experience Christian love.

229
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,881
It's a proof that you could have these kind of successful communes, but only if they're Christian communes.

230
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:06,040
Where Christian doesn't mean anymore just belonging to some Christian church.

231
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:17,880
It means being in the culture in which there is a certain kind of love and having been exposed to it and, so to speak, caught it in a way that we haven't explained yet.

232
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:21,241
So, and that's on the bottom of 346.

233
00:19:21,241 --> 00:19:27,880
The mysterious visitor is saying, and what do you have to do to get rid of these terribly selfish, upset people?

234
00:19:27,881 --> 00:19:31,881
Well, he says you have to have a psychological transformation.

235
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:35,080
He says it's a spiritual, psychological process.

236
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,360
Now, just for a moment, word about vocabulary.

237
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,160
The right thing to say is certainly spiritual.

238
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:48,520
And it was okay in Dostoevsky's time, I gather, to equate psychological with spiritual some of the time.

239
00:19:48,520 --> 00:20:01,961
Now, I mean, that doesn't, to say it's a psychological process now means it's something natural that happens because of the way, I don't know, the neurons are, or the DNA is, or your brain is, or how you're socialized.

240
00:20:01,961 --> 00:20:06,121
And Dostoevsky thinks that it's a spiritual change.

241
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,680
I mean, it's a kind of being reborn.

242
00:20:08,681 --> 00:20:12,841
And it's not something you can account for in a scientific way.

243
00:20:13,161 --> 00:20:17,080
And he's very strange about this because he really understands that.

244
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,160
He's against psychology.

245
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:26,961
Because of their attempt to make a kind of rational understanding of human beings, they don't understand the contradictions in human beings.

246
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:30,000
They don't understand the possibility of transformation.

247
00:20:24,921 --> 00:20:37,441
And the way his hate, really hate of psychologists and psychology comes out is in the trial.

248
00:20:37,441 --> 00:20:44,641
The forensic psychologists are all trying to understand who killed old Karamatsov, that's no big secret, and why.

249
00:20:45,681 --> 00:20:48,641
And they are making absolute fools of themselves.

250
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:56,000
But that's just because they don't understand spiritual transformation.

251
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:08,800
And Dostoevsky thinks because psychology has to do with the soul, so to speak, in the satsika in Greek, it ought to cover the spiritual thing.

252
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:17,441
But if you, it's better to read him just understanding that what he really is interested in is these existential transformations.

253
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:23,360
And that's got to do with selfishness and sinfulness and how it can be overcome by love.

254
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,121
And we'll just call it spiritual.

255
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:27,920
So it's a spiritual process to transform the world.

256
00:21:27,921 --> 00:21:29,600
We're at the bottom of 346.

257
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:35,760
To transform the world, to recreate it afresh, men must turn into another path psychologically.

258
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,800
I cross it out and say existentially or spiritually, just confusing.

259
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:46,320
Until you have become really, in fact, a brother to everyone, brotherhood will not come to pass.

260
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:53,680
No sort of scientific teaching, see, so psychology was not considered scientific teaching then, like it is now.

261
00:21:53,681 --> 00:22:01,600
No sort of scientific teaching, no kind of common interest will ever teach men to share property and privileges with equal consideration.

262
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
Everyone will think his share too small.

263
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,280
They'll always be envying and so forth.

264
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,241
And now we're getting into that other passage I read.

265
00:22:08,241 --> 00:22:09,961
They will be sinful.

266
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,920
Only his transformation can make it all right.

267
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,280
Now I have to choose.

268
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:22,280
So given the way human nature is, the free market won't work.

269
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:27,400
The planned state won't leave people free.

270
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:38,760
The communes will fail until something very radical happens to all of humanity, which, believe it or not, Dostoevsky's got a big vision.

271
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,760
We will hear about what it is and how it's going to happen.

272
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:52,361
But in the meantime, he's anticipating the failure of state communism and the meltdown of the free market and so all on it all on his own.

273
00:22:53,481 --> 00:23:07,560
So, but now we're on to this interesting thing, which is very hard to understand until you crack the code, which is Yvonne's story about whether the state should become a church or the church should become a state and what in the world that means.

274
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:16,120
Remember, he's written an article to that effect, and all the monks are very confused trying to interpret it, and I was confused for years trying to interpret it.

275
00:23:16,121 --> 00:23:20,280
But I've now given you all the clues you need to understand it.

276
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:29,080
The Grand Inquisitor proposes a kind of secular socialism, and therefore the church plays no role in it.

277
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:34,600
The church becomes the state, it becomes, say, Soviet Russia.

278
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,360
That's one possibility.

279
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:46,600
Then the church stops, disappears, and the secular gets the job of distributing the wealth and keeping people from grabbing things from each other.

280
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:54,921
The church can't be formed, transformed into a state, however, because the people will stay as nasty as ever.

281
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:12,000
It's the mistaken idea, the way it's set up in here, of the Catholic Church, who doesn't understand the need for transformation, to think that if you just, the way it's set up here, collect all the stuff from everybody and redistribute it, everything will be all right.

282
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,600
But that's just the Roman Catholic way, not the right way.

283
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,800
Now, this is on 72.

284
00:24:19,121 --> 00:24:21,120
I've been saying all this.

285
00:24:21,121 --> 00:24:33,040
Now, what happens if the church gets turned into a state, it just stops being spiritual and religious and takes on the planned economy business.

286
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:43,360
So, what would it be for the state to become a church would be for everybody in the state to become genuinely religious?

287
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,000
So, this is talked about on 72, second paragraph.

288
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,961
They're discussing Yvonne's paper.

289
00:24:50,961 --> 00:24:54,241
You are completely misunderstanding it, said Father Pius sternly.

290
00:24:54,241 --> 00:24:57,840
You must understand that the church is not to be transformed into the state.

291
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,440
That's Rome and its dreams.

292
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,401
See, there's the imp.

293
00:25:00,401 --> 00:25:04,401
Dostoevsky is always giving you these guidelines lest you're lost.

294
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:06,241
I mean, that's the Grand Inquisitor.

295
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,721
That's the third temptation of the devil.

296
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:14,800
On the contrary, the state is to be transformed into the church, will ascend and become a church over the whole world.

297
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:26,400
That's what I've been telling you, which is the complete opposite of Rome, never mind that other thing, which I don't know what it is, of Rome, and your interpretation, the other guy that Pius is talking to.

298
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:30,961
And it is only the glorious destiny ordained to the Orthodox Church.

299
00:25:30,961 --> 00:25:39,280
The phrase that I've been using, and which you'll hear again a few times, the star will arise in the east, means the Russian Orthodox Church will save the world.

300
00:25:40,201 --> 00:25:45,641
And that means that in this sort of code, the state will become a church.

301
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:55,721
That is, the people will be transformed, and then they will have their religion.

302
00:25:55,721 --> 00:26:01,080
Now, again, Dostoevsky is so easy to understand in a way.

303
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:11,161
You will, if this is what, if this is really the explanation of what Ivan is talking about, Dostoevsky is going to tell you right out and hit you over the head with it.

304
00:26:11,161 --> 00:26:19,321
On page 73, four lines down, we have a little thing attributed to Peter Muazov.

305
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:29,000
Muazov, and usually when Dostoevsky tells you the true view, he puts it in the mouth of somebody who doesn't believe it and doesn't understand it.

306
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,241
We'll see that happening again today if we get to the miracle.

307
00:26:33,241 --> 00:26:42,201
But so here you get Muazov, who is the Western European secular guy in the book.

308
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:46,201
He'd be a bad guy if he did anything, but he's just a kind of observer.

309
00:26:46,201 --> 00:26:48,680
So he doesn't play any important role.

310
00:26:48,681 --> 00:27:04,520
But now, Dostoevsky is going to put into the mouth of the bad guy his belief, which he's going to sort of defend and explain in the book, that for human beings to survive, the state must become a church.

311
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,320
So here it is, four lines down on 73.

312
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,481
We are not particularly afraid, he said.

313
00:27:09,481 --> 00:27:15,800
Muazov was talking to some sort of CIA guy or FBI guy, a secret agent in the West.

314
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:22,040
We're not particularly afraid, said he, of all these socialists, anarchists, infidels, and revolutionaries.

315
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,040
Those are all secular religious groups.

316
00:27:24,441 --> 00:27:27,121
We keep watch on them and know all their doings.

317
00:27:27,681 --> 00:27:36,400
But there are a few peculiar men among them who believe in God and are Christians, but at the same time socialists.

318
00:27:36,401 --> 00:27:38,721
Those are the people we're most afraid of.

319
00:27:38,721 --> 00:27:40,481
Well, that's Dostoevsky.

320
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:55,680
The people they're most afraid of are the people who think that there must be, that people must be changed, transformed in order to form a state, and that they know how to do it, because Christianity knows how to do it.

321
00:27:55,681 --> 00:28:03,040
Okay, now I think I should stop for a minute because I think I want to make sure I have done the whole story about bread.

322
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,321
Yeah, okay.

323
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,921
Anybody want to say anything?

324
00:28:05,921 --> 00:28:13,441
I mean, it's so consistent and original and fascinating, but you really can't test it.

325
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:24,000
You really can't test it till you have to get to the end of the book, and then you have to ask yourself, well, has he showed you how it's going to work and convinced you that the star is going to rise in the East or not?

326
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,401
So I think you can't really, I can't really expect you to have an opinion, but happily someone does.

327
00:28:28,401 --> 00:28:29,441
Go ahead.

328
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,481
That's what?

329
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,080
That it's, in a way, socialist.

330
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,560
What?

331
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,440
Dostoevsky is a socialist.

332
00:28:37,441 --> 00:28:37,921
Yeah.

333
00:28:37,921 --> 00:28:39,441
He's a Christian socialist.

334
00:28:39,441 --> 00:28:40,400
No, I never said that.

335
00:28:40,401 --> 00:28:41,601
Somebody else might have said that.

336
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,121
I think maybe the introduction, the forward or something says that.

337
00:28:45,121 --> 00:28:50,641
He may have been a monarchist too, but I don't know what he thought the monarch was supposed to do.

338
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:55,041
His basic view is to be a Christian socialist.

339
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:03,040
That is, you've got to believe that the monarchy, I don't believe he could hold that because the theme can't transform people.

340
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,201
Only Christian love can transform people.

341
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,320
Let me just review.

342
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,961
And people are innately sinful and selfish.

343
00:29:08,961 --> 00:29:10,241
That's original sin.

344
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,520
And you can't build a state on people who are so insecure and greedy.

345
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,520
So you've got to have a Christian socialism.

346
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:34,520
And he may think, you know, like in England or someplace, that there ought to be a nice place for the monarch to be the kind of high example of the Christian life or something, but he can't, he can't, he has to be a Christian socialist, given what I've, all the stuff I've said.

347
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:40,360
If anything in the book contradicts this, please come to my office hours and tell me or send me an email.

348
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,760
And if you find out even that he was a monarchist, just give me the reference and I'll okay.

349
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,161
Yeah.

350
00:29:45,721 --> 00:29:57,481
Wouldn't you like to see the instance of related arts orthodox by law enarchists?

351
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:05,400
Well, I don't know what to say to you guys because I don't really know, or I must admit, care much about what he really believed.

352
00:30:05,401 --> 00:30:11,721
I wanted to sort of talk about the Dostoevsky that comes out of reading this book.

353
00:30:11,721 --> 00:30:27,481
And there's nothing in this book which pretends to, or claims to explain all the possible socialist and anti-socialist view about how to distribute material goods, and nothing about monarchists.

354
00:30:27,481 --> 00:30:32,280
When the star arises in the East, I don't think the monarch is going to have anything to do with it.

355
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,321
So I don't know.

356
00:30:33,641 --> 00:30:43,080
It's a great subject for both of you to try to figure out how he could be a conservative Marxist and be busy writing this book.

357
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:49,880
This book sounds like it comes from the time that he got in trouble and almost shot, not the view he ended up with.

358
00:30:50,201 --> 00:30:51,241
But don't worry about it.

359
00:30:52,121 --> 00:31:08,400
We're trying to figure out what, remember back to the first lecture, what is the kind of revealing experience that Dostoevsky's got, out of which all of his views come, and which he's trying to get you to experience in the book.

360
00:31:08,401 --> 00:31:17,120
And I don't care whether he actually had that experience or that view, but the way the book works, in fact, we're very close.

361
00:31:17,121 --> 00:31:25,520
You are now within 20 pages, if you did the assignment, what I told you to read, with the central religious experience of the book.

362
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,361
You get to read it over vacation.

363
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:40,800
Because even if we get to the miracle today, which I don't know yet, it's right after the miracle that he understands sort of the deep religious truth about the universe.

364
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,520
But we're not going to talk about that yet.

365
00:31:44,161 --> 00:31:45,441
And I really am worried now.

366
00:31:45,441 --> 00:31:48,880
Both of you really help try to figure out what's going on here.

367
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:59,600
Because I'm absolutely sure that I'm telling you what the book says, and I don't feel that you're going to find anything that contradicts what I'm saying, but I don't understand yet how to deal with what you guys say.

368
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,120
So let's see now.

369
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:02,800
Where am I?

370
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,680
Turn too many pages, maybe.

371
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,641
Yes.

372
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:08,160
Okay, here we are.

373
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,040
Now, what about community and church?

374
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,040
We get them out of the way in three minutes, which is a good thing.

375
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:24,401
But remember the issue: should must people relate to God as a single isolated individual?

376
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:33,601
Sort of Protestantism, Luther pushed to the absolute limit, the thing that Kierkegaard, that Jesus says in the Grand Inquisitor, and Kierkegaard really believes?

377
00:32:34,641 --> 00:32:57,640
Or is it necessary to convert everyone to Christendom, Roman Catholic Christendom, one universal antepe, as the Grand Inquisitor calls it, because people can only believe in whatever they think is true, and they can only believe in the kind of truth which is objective truth, universal, and shared.

378
00:32:57,641 --> 00:33:07,640
I mean, Kierkegaard, you know, just takes that head on and says the truth is subjectivity, meaning everybody has their own unconditional commitment, which is their own truth.

379
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:15,400
But the Grand Inquisitor says, no, the truth is objectivity, and there must be, and there's some right answer, or even if there isn't, it doesn't matter.

380
00:33:15,401 --> 00:33:18,601
We're going to give everybody the impression there's some right answer.

381
00:33:18,601 --> 00:33:19,880
And what does Kierkegaard?

382
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,721
I mean, what does Dostoevsky think?

383
00:33:21,721 --> 00:33:24,601
Well, it's very simple what Dostoevsky thinks.

384
00:33:24,601 --> 00:33:26,121
Not very exciting.

385
00:33:26,121 --> 00:33:44,521
But, you know, I mean, what he thinks is that a single individual can't be a believing Christian, and that Christianity isn't going to be some universal church.

386
00:33:45,241 --> 00:34:10,841
Sort of contradicting what I'm saying in a way, because when the star arises from the east and the world is saved, why isn't that a well, it might be a universal church, but what makes it work is the individual loving of people's neighbors by their neighbors, not because the church has the truth and everybody believes the truth or has to believe it.

387
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,921
So here's what you need to have.

388
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:20,760
Dostoevsky's kind of religion, about four lines from the top of three, four lines from the top of 370.

389
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,960
And if this is all Zosima, but I think we're supposed to believe it.

390
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,121
Most of what Zosima says.

391
00:34:24,201 --> 00:34:28,081
You believe whatever Zosima says until it's proved otherwise.

392
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:30,241
And sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't.

393
00:34:30,561 --> 00:34:35,201
And that's only natural, because being in the monastery, he's got it sort of right and sort of wrong.

394
00:34:35,201 --> 00:34:40,641
And if two of you are gathered together, then there is a whole world, a world of living love.

395
00:34:40,641 --> 00:34:42,960
Embrace each other tenderly and praise God.

396
00:34:43,121 --> 00:34:47,521
If only in you two, his truth has been fulfilled.

397
00:34:47,521 --> 00:34:49,120
So that's consistent.

398
00:34:49,121 --> 00:35:01,040
I mean, if the Christian message is love of the kind, which we're going to hear more and more about as the book goes on, it's love of one person for another.

399
00:35:01,601 --> 00:35:11,760
It's what used to be translated charity and faith, hope, and charity, but now charity's gotten sort of used up, so people say faith, hope, and love.

400
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:19,440
But I mean, as long as you can't love just by yourself, and it's not love if you can't love everybody, you can't love humanity.

401
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,841
That's what Yvonne thinks he can do.

402
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:27,681
But you have to love your neighbor, and then there is a church.

403
00:35:27,681 --> 00:35:36,721
So when there's two or more people gathered together, that is a Christian community, according to Dostoevsky's account.

404
00:35:36,721 --> 00:35:41,601
Now that's so simple and straightforward, I don't have anything more to say about it.

405
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:46,881
At the end of the book, so many things happen in about the last ten pages of the book.

406
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,280
You will see the creation of a Christian community.

407
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,641
Dostoevsky has a workout idea about what a Christian community is and how you create one.

408
00:35:54,641 --> 00:35:58,641
But until then, I don't think there's anything more I can say about it.

409
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,961
I doubt if there's anything you can say about it, though you're welcome to say something.

410
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:10,841
Okay, well, then we get to the great good one, which we're certainly going to do before I rush out of here.

411
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,681
And that's confession.

412
00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:15,241
Now, remember the view again.

413
00:36:15,561 --> 00:36:21,880
Christ's view in the Grand Inquisitor is that you have to settle any moral issues alone with God.

414
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,560
God isn't going to give you any rules.

415
00:36:23,561 --> 00:36:25,401
God isn't going to give you any help.

416
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,041
God isn't going to get you out of your anguish.

417
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,880
It's the teleological suspension of the ethical.

418
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:38,680
There's something higher than the ethical, and it's unintelligible, and there's nobody going to help you deal with it.

419
00:36:38,681 --> 00:36:39,800
You're going to be in anguish.

420
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,241
It's all Kierkegaard.

421
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:45,080
The Inquisitor's view is that people need moral guidelines.

422
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:52,681
They need people to hear their confessions and forgive them when they do something wrong and tell them what they should have done.

423
00:36:52,681 --> 00:36:57,800
And so now we're going to expect a complicated sort of answer.

424
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,081
Or maybe you're not expecting it, but you're going to get a complicated answer.

425
00:37:01,081 --> 00:37:11,000
Because this is the first place, and one of the only places, I think, where Dostoevsky diverges from the Russian Orthodox Church.

426
00:37:11,001 --> 00:37:16,280
I mean, remember, the Russian Orthodox Church is the answer to the antinomies.

427
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:24,921
And so it ought to come out that somehow the relation of what he says to the Russian Orthodox Church ought to be pretty similar.

428
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,560
But on confession, he just thinks the church is wrong.

429
00:37:27,561 --> 00:37:35,561
And after all, he's got his own brilliant view about all of these existentialized notions.

430
00:37:35,561 --> 00:37:44,680
And when he existentializes confession, which is what he's about to do, he has his ideas about what it really is when it isn't magical.

431
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:52,840
And he thinks just somebody going and confessing to somebody else who has the power to absolve them and says you're forgiven, that that's magic.

432
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,800
And we're not going to have that kind of magic.

433
00:37:54,521 --> 00:37:57,920
So out with the Russian Orthodox view of confession.

434
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:16,561
Because even for the Russian Orthodox, as for the Catholic, the Roman Catholics, confession is private and secret between the person and the sinner, you or me, and the person they're confessing to, the priest.

435
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:22,001
And moreover, it's secret so that nobody needs to know what you confess.

436
00:38:22,001 --> 00:38:27,280
That's all just wrong, psychologically or existentially, let's say, spiritually.

437
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,400
So we have to go on.

438
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,081
So get rid of that.

439
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,321
So the question is, what should the Russian Orthodox Church do?

440
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,481
Well, that's the second stage would be to look at Zosima.

441
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,721
Because normally, Zosima gets it right.

442
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:51,920
Again, not always, but in this case, what Zosima does is obviously what confession should be.

443
00:38:54,161 --> 00:38:55,681
But you don't have to believe me.

444
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:58,640
Gostevsky is going to hit you over the head with it when the time comes.

445
00:38:58,641 --> 00:39:01,521
But it starts on 179.

446
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,601
Here's what Zosima does.

447
00:39:03,601 --> 00:39:19,361
As a rule, every evening, the middle of 179, as a rule, every evening after service, the monks walked into Father Zosima's cell and confessed aloud, see, not private, their sins of the day, their sinful thoughts and temptations, their disagreements.

448
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,800
Some confessed kneeling.

449
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,561
The elder absolved, reconciled, exhorted, imposed penance, blessed and dismissed them.

450
00:39:26,561 --> 00:39:35,681
It was against this general confession that the opponents of elders protested, maintaining that it profaned the sacrament of confession.

451
00:39:35,681 --> 00:39:36,720
Well, it does.

452
00:39:36,721 --> 00:39:45,800
I mean, the sacrament of confession, the way the church, both Roman and Russian, interpreted it, it's not supposed to be a public, it's not supposed to be an encounter group.

453
00:39:40,001 --> 00:39:54,041
I mean, when I first came to Berkeley, there were these encounter groups where everybody had confessed everything in front of everybody else, and everybody forgave them, and everybody felt better.

454
00:39:54,041 --> 00:40:05,881
But that's not what the church wants, and that's not even that's not what Dostoevsky wants either, because if you do it without love, it's not going to work, he thinks.

455
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,680
But then what does Dostoevsky want?

456
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:15,560
Well, he wants something like what Zosim is doing, but he wants it to have an existential basis.

457
00:40:15,561 --> 00:40:18,600
I mean, it looks like Zosima just arbitrarily does this.

458
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:29,881
Zosima gives no explanation directly of what he is up to when he calls them in and absolves them and so forth.

459
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,881
But, and now we get to the really interesting part.

460
00:40:34,201 --> 00:40:42,361
Dostoevsky is going to give you, and it'll take probably the rest of the time, an example of a real existential confession.

461
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,360
And that's the mysterious visitor.

462
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,841
That's what happens on 344.

463
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:50,520
And starting on 344 is, and Zosima is telling it.

464
00:40:50,521 --> 00:40:56,440
So in a sense, Zosima is really giving you the story behind what he's doing when he calls everybody into the room.

465
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,441
He knows, I think, what he's doing.

466
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,081
But he tells it indirectly.

467
00:41:02,521 --> 00:41:15,441
But it's the, as he says in his letter, Dostoevsky, it's the indirect answer to the Grand Inquisitor story that you either should be confessing secretly to God, or you should be.

468
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,521
Did I get the other side, confessing to everyone?

469
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:20,121
No.

470
00:41:20,121 --> 00:41:22,601
What's the other half of the antinomy of confession?

471
00:41:22,601 --> 00:41:23,320
Help.

472
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,201
Where's my?

473
00:41:24,201 --> 00:41:25,000
I need a chart.

474
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,200
Who has my chart?

475
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:34,401
Whoever was giving out the chart, what's the third view on confession?

476
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,241
No, no, that's what the Grand Inquisitor says Jesus wants.

477
00:41:38,241 --> 00:41:39,601
That's Kierkegaard.

478
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,961
I said a lot about that, but I didn't say what the opposed view of confession would be.

479
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,320
I see what you're saying.

480
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,880
That's why I didn't is because it's so confusing.

481
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,640
The Kierkegaard won.

482
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,480
Ah, no, I see.

483
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,921
Oh, now I see.

484
00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:01,601
Remember when the Grand Inquisitor says there shouldn't be any tittle-tattle between men about what should only be with God?

485
00:42:01,601 --> 00:42:05,121
Yeah, the funny antinomy works.

486
00:42:05,121 --> 00:42:07,441
Everybody thinks confession is private.

487
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:25,361
Kierkegaard thinks it's so private that you can't even share your confession with a single other human being, and that it's a bad thing that in the Roman Catholic Church, human beings confess to me or other human beings about what they should keep secret and confess to God about.

488
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,201
So that's the antinomy.

489
00:42:27,201 --> 00:42:32,321
And the resolution is it's not a private thing, it can't be a private thing.

490
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:44,321
That's the common mistaken assumption between the disagreement about whether it's confession to nobody but God or confession to somebody who represents God and keeps quiet about it.

491
00:42:44,561 --> 00:42:45,920
Now, that's okay.

492
00:42:46,161 --> 00:42:47,040
Here we go now.

493
00:42:47,280 --> 00:43:00,320
And the mysterious visitor is going to explain what confession is, what spiritual/slash psychological role it plays, and how it has to be done.

494
00:43:00,641 --> 00:43:02,961
And so we're ready to go.

495
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:15,161
So the mysterious visitor story starts on 344, and it starts with the mysterious visitor saying these stories about how everybody lives in isolation.

496
00:43:09,681 --> 00:43:22,361
And the background story now is the mysterious visitor has committed a murder.

497
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:25,321
He murdered his girlfriend out of jealousy.

498
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:31,001
And he got away with it because they arrested the wrong person.

499
00:43:31,001 --> 00:43:35,481
And then before they had a chance to find out it was the wrong person, that person died in prison.

500
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:42,680
And the Grand Inquisitor was always a respected member of society, and nobody suspects him at all.

501
00:43:43,001 --> 00:43:47,320
So now that should remind you of two Woody Allen movies.

502
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,520
I mean, it helps a lot.

503
00:43:48,521 --> 00:43:51,080
If I had time, we could have shown one.

504
00:43:52,201 --> 00:43:54,521
Has any, let me get better, close the door.

505
00:43:54,521 --> 00:43:57,161
A riot is about to take place out there.

506
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,120
So, yeah, close the door.

507
00:44:00,121 --> 00:44:00,681
Go ahead.

508
00:44:00,681 --> 00:44:02,201
Stand up.

509
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,961
We're going to close the door, please.

510
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,480
No, I think we'll open the door.

511
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,840
And it's not going to chop it.

512
00:44:09,081 --> 00:44:10,760
We're all in here.

513
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:15,401
Well, come in and close.

514
00:44:15,721 --> 00:44:17,000
I've got a solution for you.

515
00:44:17,001 --> 00:44:18,841
Come in and close the door.

516
00:44:19,161 --> 00:44:20,120
Seriously.

517
00:44:20,121 --> 00:44:22,760
Then whoever's chasing you will protect you.

518
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:24,600
Okay?

519
00:44:26,521 --> 00:44:27,800
Okay, well, we're going on.

520
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,041
We offer you asylum if you want it.

521
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:32,120
Okay, whatever it is.

522
00:44:32,121 --> 00:44:33,641
It ended peacefully.

523
00:44:33,641 --> 00:44:35,080
Okay, now where were we?

524
00:44:36,681 --> 00:44:37,241
Oh, yeah.

525
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:38,440
Two movies.

526
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,561
How many, a while back, Woody Allen movie sort of come and go.

527
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:44,760
That's good.

528
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,241
Good.

529
00:44:45,241 --> 00:44:46,201
He closed the door.

530
00:44:46,201 --> 00:44:48,041
Now that one's closed, too.

531
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:49,241
Peace and quiet.

532
00:44:49,241 --> 00:44:53,001
Okay, so have you seen Crimes and misdemeanors?

533
00:44:53,001 --> 00:44:54,361
Good, good, good.

534
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,040
Okay, the latest one is Matchpoint.

535
00:44:57,041 --> 00:44:58,161
Have you seen Match Point?

536
00:44:54,601 --> 00:45:00,560
So, Woody Allen's got two movies that are exactly the same.

537
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,880
I was sort of annoyed at Match Point.

538
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,881
I think Crimes and Misdemeanors is better.

539
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:10,080
But those movies are aimed at taking back the mysterious visitor.

540
00:45:10,081 --> 00:45:15,280
And Woody Allen knows his Dostoevsky, and he's always sort of trying to take it back.

541
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,000
What happens, but notice it starts the same.

542
00:45:18,001 --> 00:45:23,201
Somebody who's a pillar of the community commits a murder and gets away with it.

543
00:45:23,201 --> 00:45:26,401
And there's going to be nobody ever going to find out about it.

544
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:34,481
And then, remember, the second thing in Crimes and Misdemeanor is he starts feeling so guilty that he can't go on.

545
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,201
And it's like crime and punishment at that point.

546
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:39,361
He has to confess, he feels.

547
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:45,441
And then time passes and he gets his wits back together again, and he doesn't confess, and he lives happily ever after.

548
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,000
That is the anti-Dostoevsky view.

549
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:51,760
The Dostoevsky view is he has to confess.

550
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,561
And now the question is: who's right?

551
00:45:54,561 --> 00:45:57,201
And I can at least tell you Dostoevsky's story.

552
00:45:57,201 --> 00:45:58,480
I really don't know who's right.

553
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,201
I'm inclined to think that Dostoevsky is right.

554
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:06,480
People can't commit murders and just feel okay about it.

555
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,760
But I'm not sure.

556
00:46:08,081 --> 00:46:10,960
Anyway, Dostoevsky seems to be sure.

557
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,161
So let's go on.

558
00:46:12,161 --> 00:46:13,760
So what happens now?

559
00:46:14,001 --> 00:46:15,041
Here he is.

560
00:46:15,041 --> 00:46:17,361
He's gotten away with this murder.

561
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:21,280
He's a happily married man and has children.

562
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,320
And then the trouble starts at the bottom of 351.

563
00:46:24,641 --> 00:46:26,241
The children came.

564
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:28,880
How dare I love them, teach and educate them?

565
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,881
How can I talk to them of virtue?

566
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,241
I've shed blood.

567
00:46:32,241 --> 00:46:33,600
They were fine children.

568
00:46:33,601 --> 00:46:37,441
He longed to caress them, but I can't look at their innocent faces.

569
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,121
I'm unworthy.

570
00:46:39,121 --> 00:46:39,920
And this is the thing.

571
00:46:40,601 --> 00:46:41,800
You're getting the picture.

572
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,961
What's really happening?

573
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:57,241
He's isolated because he can't share with anybody the intimacy because what he essentially is, namely a murderer, is what he can't tell them.

574
00:46:57,241 --> 00:46:59,400
It's there, it's like Hiroshima Monomur.

575
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:12,361
She's leading this totally secret life from her own husband and family and so forth, that she's really brooding over the love, still loves the German in her night of resignation way.

576
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,521
And she's in trouble and in despair.

577
00:47:14,521 --> 00:47:17,721
And he's in trouble and in despair.

578
00:47:17,721 --> 00:47:30,280
At the bottom of 351, at last he began to be bitterly and ominously haunted by the blood of his murdered victim, by the young life that he'd destroyed, by the blood that cried out for vengeance.

579
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:38,520
He began to have awful dreams that being a man of strength, he bore his suffering a long time, thinking, I shall atone for everything by this secret agony.

580
00:47:38,521 --> 00:47:41,561
Well, that's the Kierkegaard Jesus one.

581
00:47:41,561 --> 00:47:44,040
You atone before God with your secret agony.

582
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:45,401
That didn't work.

583
00:47:46,041 --> 00:47:48,201
He was respected for benevolence.

584
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,721
He's like the doctor in Crimes and Misdemeanors.

585
00:47:51,721 --> 00:47:57,080
And then, about 15 lines down, we leave Woody Allen and go on to Dostoevsky.

586
00:47:57,081 --> 00:48:04,201
An idea which he had at first regarded as impossible and unthinkable, though at last it got such a hold on his heart that he couldn't shake it off.

587
00:48:04,201 --> 00:48:09,001
He dreamed of rising up, going out and confessing before all men that he had committed murder.

588
00:48:09,001 --> 00:48:12,441
For three years, this dream pursued him, haunted him in different forms.

589
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:18,280
At last he believed with his whole heart that if he confessed his crime, he would heal his soul and would be at peace forever.

590
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:22,441
But the belief filled his heart with terror, for how could he carry it out?

591
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:29,840
And then we get a bit of example of how people influence each other's lives, which is a whole theme in the brothers.

592
00:48:30,161 --> 00:48:41,681
And Dostima, without knowing it, and for reasons that we don't know yet, threw away his gun instead of fighting a duel.

593
00:48:41,681 --> 00:48:44,560
And that convinced the mysterious visitor.

594
00:48:44,561 --> 00:48:46,641
Looking at you, I made up my mind.

595
00:48:46,641 --> 00:48:47,841
I looked at him.

596
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,921
Is it possible that such an incident could give rise to such a decision?

597
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:57,841
And then he says, Yes, I've been going on for three years thinking about it, and you sort of crystallize it.

598
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,161
And so remember his problem.

599
00:49:00,161 --> 00:49:04,721
He's in isolation because he can't tell the truth about himself.

600
00:49:04,721 --> 00:49:06,800
So he can't have any intimacy.

601
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,401
So he's in despair.

602
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,241
And now there's a solution.

603
00:49:10,241 --> 00:49:11,601
Tell everybody.

604
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:19,921
And so he says in the next page, in the big paragraph in the middle, I know it will be heaven for me, heaven the moment I confess.

605
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,081
14 years I've been in hell.

606
00:49:22,081 --> 00:49:28,321
Well, incidentally, what's being demagicalized and existentialized?

607
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,401
And you're being hit over the head with it.

608
00:49:30,721 --> 00:49:37,361
Confession and heaven and hell.

609
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:40,721
Yes, he's going to say this over and over, lest you might miss it.

610
00:49:40,721 --> 00:49:41,920
14 years I've been in hell.

611
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:42,641
I want to suffer.

612
00:49:42,641 --> 00:49:44,800
I will take my punishment and begin to live.

613
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,360
You can pass through the world doing wrong, but there's no turning back.

614
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:51,280
Now I dare not love my neighbor or even my own children.

615
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,760
So he's going to do it.

616
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:00,481
And again, Dostievski hits you over the head again in an interesting way.

617
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,720
He wants to say, this is in the Bible.

618
00:50:02,721 --> 00:50:08,080
And he says, the mysterious visitor takes this book, or the Grand Inquisitor does, I don't remember.

619
00:50:08,081 --> 00:50:10,601
I took the book, opened it in another place.

620
00:50:10,001 --> 00:50:14,600
Yeah, this grand, it's awesome, and showed him the epistle to the Hebrews.

621
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:18,841
He read, It's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

622
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:22,041
That's the sort of magical expression.

623
00:50:22,041 --> 00:50:27,561
Then we're getting the psychological, spiritual reality or the existential reality.

624
00:50:27,561 --> 00:50:30,921
And so he does it at the bottom of 355.

625
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:32,760
There was a big party.

626
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,841
Everyone in town went to it.

627
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:41,561
After dinner, he walked into the middle of the room with a paper in his hand, a formal declaration to the chief of his department who was present.

628
00:50:41,561 --> 00:50:44,040
The declaration he read aloud to the whole assembly.

629
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:47,721
It contained a full account of the crime in every detail.

630
00:50:47,721 --> 00:50:49,640
I cut myself off as a monster.

631
00:50:49,641 --> 00:50:51,000
God has visited me.

632
00:50:51,001 --> 00:50:54,601
He said in conclusion, I want to suffer for my sin.

633
00:50:54,920 --> 00:51:01,081
And then he brought out and laid on the table all the things he'd been keeping for 14 years that he thought would prove his crime.

634
00:51:01,081 --> 00:51:03,001
Well, then strange things happen.

635
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,480
But you got it already, I hope.

636
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:12,600
The basic point is: confession is necessary because if you've done something wrong, you're isolated.

637
00:51:12,601 --> 00:51:15,880
This is sort of the extremist version, and you're the most extremely isolated.

638
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:31,400
That if you've just, I don't know, stolen something, that's a secret too, that you keep, and if it was important enough for you to do it, then it's a part of you that keeps you from getting in a full intimate relationship with people you care about.

639
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,280
It's a secret.

640
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,561
You can't tell anybody.

641
00:51:33,561 --> 00:51:36,441
So, what kind of confession do you need?

642
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:43,881
Will it help to talk to a priest who's sworn to secrecy about this and shouldn't even testify in a trial, even if you tell him you're a murderer?

643
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:44,921
Certainly not.

644
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,041
That won't get you back in touch with your wife and your kids.

645
00:51:48,041 --> 00:51:54,041
And will it help to secretly, you know, before God, suffer for what you've done?

646
00:51:54,041 --> 00:51:55,241
Well, that won't help either.

647
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:05,280
The way Dostoevsky sets it up, which is very interesting, is that crimes isolate you, and confession reunites you.

648
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:15,921
See, that's what's happening in his cell when the priests all come in and they all tell their nasty thoughts and the bad things they've done and what things they may have stolen and so forth.

649
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,920
And then he doesn't have to absolve them.

650
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,561
I mean, or he doesn't absolve them in any magical way.

651
00:52:22,561 --> 00:52:27,121
He tells them, okay, now we all know your secret and we know you're sorry, and we're all part of it.

652
00:52:27,201 --> 00:52:28,641
We're back together again.

653
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,280
That's the idea.

654
00:52:31,521 --> 00:52:31,920
Anybody?

655
00:52:32,161 --> 00:52:41,201
Okay, so now, but then comes the weirdness that would be in the movie that Woody Allen didn't make.

656
00:52:41,201 --> 00:52:43,041
How are you going to end it?

657
00:52:43,041 --> 00:52:47,760
Well, it turns out nobody believes that the Grand Inquisitor is guilty.

658
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,561
Sorry.

659
00:52:48,561 --> 00:52:52,001
Nobody believes that Michael, the mysterious visitor, is guilty.

660
00:52:52,001 --> 00:52:57,280
And that's because he's been behaving like such a good father and good member of the community all this time.

661
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:02,081
They can't believe that he would ever kill his lover, his girlfriend.

662
00:53:02,081 --> 00:53:07,441
And the question to ask is: would he, the man that he is at the time he's confessing?

663
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,481
Would he be the kind of guy to kill his girlfriend?

664
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,841
Certainly not.

665
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:23,441
It's the puzzle of people on death row, after 15 years on death row, reading the Bible and feeling terrible about what they've done, are now different people, and then they're going to put them in the electric chair or not.

666
00:53:23,601 --> 00:53:40,161
I suppose the Christians, I think that this person has been reborn, and the people who are picketing and saying no capital punishment are Christians, and the secular people are saying he's the same guy he always was, and he's a murderer, never mind whether he's transformed or not.

667
00:53:41,641 --> 00:53:49,800
And so Dostoevsky raises the question, and he sort of dodges it by having the mysterious visitor.

668
00:53:49,800 --> 00:54:00,441
The mysterious visitor is happy because he's now recognized for what he is, namely a good man who would never kill anybody.

669
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:04,280
And that's all Dostoevsky needs.

670
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,880
So he gets him off the stage.

671
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,480
He dies in a hurry in prison.

672
00:54:11,241 --> 00:54:19,161
So at the bottom of 356, he says, second sense, the nature of his illness I can't explain.

673
00:54:19,161 --> 00:54:20,921
They said it was an ailment of the heart.

674
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:28,280
Dostoevsky loves to make these relations between the sort of physical body and the emotions that you have.

675
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:33,721
It's an illness of the emotions.

676
00:54:33,721 --> 00:54:41,081
But it became known that the doctors had been induced by his wife to look into his mental condition and had come to the conclusion that it was a case of insanity.

677
00:54:41,081 --> 00:54:53,401
Well, Dostoevsky thinks, like, psychologists don't understand anything, doctors don't understand anything because they're looking for the physical causes of spiritual things, and there aren't any.

678
00:54:54,121 --> 00:54:56,600
They operate on two different levels.

679
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,040
You can't mix them up.

680
00:54:58,041 --> 00:55:01,720
So, anyway, so and so he dies in the middle of 357.

681
00:55:01,721 --> 00:55:05,561
He says, God has had pity on me and is calling me to Him.

682
00:55:05,561 --> 00:55:10,201
I know that I'm dying, but I feel joy and peace for the first time after so many years.

683
00:55:10,201 --> 00:55:12,121
There's been heaven in my heart.

684
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,201
There's where heaven is.

685
00:55:14,201 --> 00:55:19,641
From the moment I did what I had to do, now I dare to love my children and to kiss them.

686
00:55:19,641 --> 00:55:21,400
And so now we've got the whole story.

687
00:55:21,641 --> 00:55:23,921
That's what confession is.

688
00:55:23,641 --> 00:55:27,920
And so many things are happening at once.

689
00:55:28,081 --> 00:55:32,481
Dostoevsky is just amazed at how many things he's juggling at once.

690
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:40,000
Not only does the Zosima change the life of the mysterious visitor radically.

691
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:54,480
not fighting in the duel, but the mysterious visitor changes the life of Zosima radically, because it's the mysterious visitor's transformation from hell to heaven, in effect, that makes Zosima decide to go into the monastery.

692
00:55:54,480 --> 00:56:10,800
So the end of the chapter is, but I held my tongue, namely about the truth of the murder, and very shortly after I left the town, and five months later, by God's grace, I entered upon the safe and blessed path, following the unseen finger that had guided me so clearly to it.

693
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:16,961
Now, I used to think the unseen finger that guided him to the monastery was the mysterious visitor.

694
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:24,401
But it isn't, because it says, but I remember in my prayers to this day the servant of God, Michael Michiel, who suffered so greatly.

695
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,241
So that's not the unseen finger.

696
00:56:26,241 --> 00:56:28,480
So who guided him into the monastery?

697
00:56:29,041 --> 00:56:30,000
It's this mystery.

698
00:56:30,001 --> 00:56:31,040
What movie is it?

699
00:56:31,681 --> 00:56:33,201
Is it Sundance Kid?

700
00:56:33,201 --> 00:56:34,000
No, I don't think so.

701
00:56:34,001 --> 00:56:46,081
There's a movie with the same people in it, where there's somebody watching over Redford the Kid all the time, but you only see through the car, windshield, and so forth what this person is seeing.

702
00:56:46,081 --> 00:56:46,880
Do you remember that?

703
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,160
Anyway, never mind.

704
00:56:48,161 --> 00:56:49,360
But it's, yeah.

705
00:56:49,681 --> 00:56:51,280
What's a childhood memory?

706
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,161
Yeah, but not.

707
00:56:52,241 --> 00:56:53,360
Yes, you know that.

708
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,001
Right.

709
00:56:54,081 --> 00:56:55,760
Never mind, I talk about the movie.

710
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:02,241
I mean, I was just suddenly struck by this funny fact that there's an unseen, literally an unseen finger pointing the way in that movie.

711
00:57:02,241 --> 00:57:05,760
But what is the unseen finger?

712
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,040
That we don't know yet.

713
00:57:07,041 --> 00:57:08,161
Beatrice is right.

714
00:57:08,161 --> 00:57:10,201
It must be a childhood memory.

715
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:14,841
Have anybody read far enough to know what childhood memory that could be?

716
00:57:09,681 --> 00:57:15,800
You shouldn't think.

717
00:57:17,001 --> 00:57:17,721
Well, you do.

718
00:57:17,721 --> 00:57:21,160
I mean, if they've read, if they've read far enough.

719
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:33,481
Yeah, but I don't know how many people are keeping up, but you should know whose finger led him, pointed him to the monastery.

720
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:34,441
Do you know?

721
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,201
His brother, his brother.

722
00:57:36,201 --> 00:57:37,721
We haven't talked at all about his brother.

723
00:57:37,721 --> 00:57:39,320
We have to have a whole lecture on his brother.

724
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:43,001
His brother, very important existentializing.

725
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:47,161
A really interesting, complicated existentializing is going on there.

726
00:57:47,161 --> 00:57:47,880
But let's see.

727
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,560
So now let's get this straight.

728
00:57:49,561 --> 00:57:51,241
I want to just catch up.

729
00:57:51,561 --> 00:57:52,440
350.

730
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,000
I want to see that I've read all the passages that are important.

731
00:57:55,721 --> 00:57:56,760
Yeah, that's right.

732
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,040
Ah, yeah, there's one.

733
00:57:58,041 --> 00:57:59,961
I knew some little thing was missing.

734
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:12,201
Again, I mean, I'm just showing you, and you have to learn to do it, that Dostoevsky, if he feels that he hasn't said it enough yet, will be saying again and again what he thinks is important to existentialize.

735
00:58:12,201 --> 00:58:25,561
This one, you go way back to 357, and remember I said that Dostoevsky said that the answers to the antinomies of the Grand Inquisitor are in the sayings of Zosima.

736
00:58:25,561 --> 00:58:36,121
And so we should see that the sayings of Zosima is, and it's that, that's where he's talking about the mysterious visitor.

737
00:58:36,121 --> 00:58:39,960
Ah, 371 is what I want.

738
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,321
No?

739
00:58:41,641 --> 00:58:43,480
Ah, 371, yes.

740
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:47,161
I mean, just summing it up, what repeating it.

741
00:58:47,161 --> 00:58:50,201
Fathers and teachers, I ask, what is hell?

742
00:58:50,201 --> 00:58:53,320
Maybe Dostoevsky isn't sure we've got it yet.

743
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:57,280
I maintain that it is the suffering of being unable to love.

744
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:11,200
Once an infinite exist once in infinite existence, immeasurable in time and space, a spiritual creature was given on this coming to ear was given on his coming to earth the power of saying, I am and I love.

745
00:59:11,521 --> 00:59:15,760
This again, hell is the suffering of being unable to love.

746
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:19,201
That's just the other side of saying heaven is being able to love.

747
00:59:19,201 --> 00:59:29,601
And there is going to be somebody, namely obviously a Savior, who comes to earth and tells people about love and shows people how to do it.

748
00:59:29,601 --> 00:59:32,720
You might ask yourself who that is, but I'm not going to say yet.

749
00:59:33,121 --> 00:59:34,800
So let me see.

750
00:59:36,081 --> 00:59:37,601
He gets back in the community.

751
00:59:39,681 --> 00:59:41,601
Okay, so we've done that.

752
00:59:41,601 --> 00:59:46,640
Now I have to think about whether to start the miracle.

753
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:54,000
I think that's a crazy idea since I have to leave anyway.

754
00:59:54,001 --> 00:59:59,041
But I guess I'll spend a minute setting it up so we can just jump into it next time.

755
00:59:59,041 --> 01:00:01,680
Remember that the miracle is going to be the tough one.

756
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:05,601
Because a miracle, one would think, would go against the laws of physics and chemistry.

757
01:00:05,601 --> 01:00:07,360
That's what a miracle is, you would think.

758
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:14,880
And yet the existentializing says we don't want Christianity to go around committing themselves to things that are going to get them in trouble with science.

759
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,641
Science is going to take over the material world.

760
01:00:18,641 --> 01:00:24,640
You better have a story about miracles that is in the world of the spirit, to talk like Pierre Guard.

761
01:00:24,641 --> 01:00:26,081
How can that be?

762
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:28,321
Well, we're going to find out.

763
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:33,361
So the next, now, and what's the antinomy?

764
01:00:33,601 --> 01:00:47,081
The question is to keep in mind, we're going to get a demonstration of the answer to the question: can people live without miracles when the situation in their life is extremely desperate?

765
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,800
On 290.

766
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:52,681
Not 15 lines from the bottom.

767
01:00:52,681 --> 01:01:03,561
Is the nature of men such that they can reject miracles in the great moments of their life, the moments of their deepest, most agonizing spiritual difficulties, cling only to the free verdict of the heart?

768
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,161
What do you think?

769
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,520
What does Dostoevsky think?

770
01:01:06,521 --> 01:01:07,641
What does Sosima think?

771
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,721
Let's just say, what does Dostoevsky think?

772
01:01:09,721 --> 01:01:16,280
Can people, who expects them to, without any miracles, cling to the free verdict of the heart?

773
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:18,200
Jesus in the Grand Inquisitor story.

774
01:01:18,201 --> 01:01:19,560
Always, you've got to be free.

775
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,160
You take responsibility.

776
01:01:21,161 --> 01:01:22,121
God isn't going to help you.

777
01:01:22,121 --> 01:01:23,721
Your priest isn't going to help you.

778
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:40,440
And of course, the other side says, no, of course, in the middle of the page, there's this weak and unruly bunch of men, and they can't, in crises in their life, get along without miracles.

779
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,481
Otherwise, they'll lose their faith.

780
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:48,441
Now, it's very, very interesting what Dostoevsky does with this.

781
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:53,721
I will just tell you two more places than I'm going to run.

782
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,121
Well, no, I think I'll stop.

783
01:01:56,121 --> 01:02:06,841
But the issue of the miracle is that Father Zosima's body decomposes and begins to smell bad prematurely.

784
01:02:07,161 --> 01:02:12,601
And the question is, how does that affect Alyasha?

785
01:02:13,561 --> 01:02:15,001
That's one question.

786
01:02:15,001 --> 01:02:25,001
That's going to be the test of whether a very religious person in a very big crisis, the death of his elder, can get along without miracles.

787
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:28,001
And you will have to keep your eyes open for that.

788
01:02:28,001 --> 01:02:37,921
The second question, then that I just want to keep your eyes open for, is how is the death and this isn't the crucial laws of physics and chemistry story, but it's relevant.

789
01:02:38,241 --> 01:02:45,041
How is the the decomposition of Zosima's cor corpse a miracle?

790
01:02:45,041 --> 01:02:48,481
That is a kind of anti-miracle showing that he's a bad guy?

791
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:59,681
Is normally the fact that elders' bodies stay a lot longer before they begin to smell bad show that they perform miracles than Zosima doesn't?

792
01:02:59,681 --> 01:03:06,721
Or is Zosima's smelling bad just a perfectly normal following of the laws of physics and chemistry?

793
01:03:06,721 --> 01:03:12,881
Dostoevsky gives you scattered around in ways which he never collects the answer to that question.

794
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,080
You should expect which answer are you going to get?

795
01:03:16,081 --> 01:03:16,960
What do you think?

796
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:19,441
Which way is it?

797
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,360
Is it an anti-miracle?

798
01:03:22,081 --> 01:03:28,161
Is generally the non-decomposition of elders a positive miracle?

799
01:03:28,161 --> 01:03:31,520
Or is this something that you can explain by the laws of nature?

800
01:03:31,521 --> 01:03:33,280
Remember, it's not a normal.

801
01:03:34,241 --> 01:03:38,321
He's decomposing much sooner than he one would normally expect.

802
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,680
I'll give you this puzzle.

803
01:03:39,681 --> 01:03:41,440
Okay, that's an after vacation.

804
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,360
So you've got lots of interesting questions.

805
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,520
Does Alyasha need a miracle?

806
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:46,960
Does he get a miracle?

807
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,080
Want miracle?

808
01:03:48,081 --> 01:03:52,400
And did the b and how do you explain the premature decomposition of Zosima?

809
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:52,961
Yeah.

810
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,321
Wait, what?

811
01:03:54,641 --> 01:03:56,400
Ah, good question.

812
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,681
Let me look.

813
01:03:58,001 --> 01:04:08,400
You have to get through all you you're almost there when you read what you're supposed to read for today, because all you have to do is get to the uh you get to four nineteen.

814
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,241
That's what you have to get to before that.

815
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:14,920
So read to four nineteen for sure after the lecture, right after vacation.
