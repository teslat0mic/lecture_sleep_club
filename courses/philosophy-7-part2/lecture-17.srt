1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,079
And so Yvonne has convinced, remember we did rebellion last time.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:14,159
Yvonne convinced Alyasha that the world's corrupt and it's immoral and we shouldn't agree to create it.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:21,759
And anybody who's in it should not agree to stay there, but should leave.

4
00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:27,520
And part of the question was: could anybody forgive the people who tortured children?

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:33,839
And Alyasha made the mistake of saying, yes, the God-man, Jesus, has the right to forgive.

6
00:00:33,839 --> 00:00:35,839
He was innocent and he suffered.

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,639
I need help.

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,239
Beatrice.

9
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:42,159
Thank you.

10
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:44,639
What a great combination.

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,399
Okay, gotcha.

12
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,039
Sounds good.

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,999
Okay.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,720
Let's see.

15
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,479
So, and you just need to be filled in a little bit.

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,600
Dostoevsky's got his own agenda, so to speak, which he's putting in the mouth of Yvonne.

17
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:19,079
Yvonne is going to show Alyasha that this Christ figure who is perfect and who has done nothing wrong and yet suffers is not, would be a dangerous kind of person to have around.

18
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:25,800
It's the kind of Graham Greene story that innocence is dangerous, only it's even more extreme.

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:32,360
It's that people who are perfectly innocent, who always tell the truth and so forth, are dangerous.

20
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,279
How many have read The Idiot?

21
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,039
Probably not very many.

22
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,559
Okay, I think the Idiot is much misunderstood, though.

23
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:43,719
Again, I haven't read a lot of the literature, and perhaps somewhere it is understood.

24
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:48,999
I take it, the Idiot is this beautiful person who is absolutely pure.

25
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:55,800
By a kind of brain disease, he's sort of lost all of his selfishness, all of his sensuality.

26
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:02,039
He's just the perfect Christ figure come back to the modern Russia.

27
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,680
And the moral of the story, I believe, is that he creates complete havoc.

28
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:15,079
By the end of the book, everybody is destroyed into despair and suicide and so forth because he tells everybody the absolute truth.

29
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:18,839
That if he tells the women who fall in love with him, that he doesn't really love them.

30
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:21,959
He tells, I don't even remember, it's been so long.

31
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:28,999
But I think it's supposed to be a criticism of this perfect Jesus figure.

32
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:41,959
And in general, it's interesting to note that all the sort of saving people, that is, people who are able to save other people because they are saint-like, have a dark past.

33
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,680
Now, you remember Zosima's dark past?

34
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,759
What was his, I think we mentioned it last time.

35
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,759
What was he before he became a saint-like person?

36
00:02:53,759 --> 00:03:04,000
He was in the army, and he was brutal, and he slapped his orderly so much that his orderly bled, and that's when he feels bad.

37
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,719
We'll go back to that, how he realizes and changes his life.

38
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:20,639
But he has an understanding of evil, of brutality, of selfishness, and sadism and so forth from his past.

39
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,480
And the idiot who doesn't have is in trouble.

40
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,319
How many read The Possessed?

41
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,119
Anybody?

42
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,879
These are sort of suggestions for when you do read these other two great books.

43
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:37,519
In The Possessed, it's Father Tion is the sort of Zossima figure, and he has an alcoholic past.

44
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,199
They all have something.

45
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:51,840
All these people couldn't help the other people who are vulnerable and weak and so forth if they didn't understand what it is to be vulnerable and sinful and weak.

46
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:54,480
And they all do because they all were.

47
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,119
But now back to Ivan.

48
00:03:57,119 --> 00:04:08,959
He's going to show that this innocent, pure Jesus figure would make impossible demands on people because he just doesn't understand people's limitations.

49
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:24,639
And the Grand Inquisitor shows that it says, because you make these impossible demands on people, that you want them to be, in a set, perfect, and they're not, we have to fix it.

50
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:32,600
We have to set up a world in which sort of fallible, imperfect human beings can lead happy lives.

51
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,680
And your world, he says to the Jesus figure, isn't like that.

52
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,719
Now, the other thing, I'm just clearing stuff out of the way.

53
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,880
We're going to jump into the Grand Inquisitor.

54
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:50,199
There is unbelievable misunderstanding of the Grand Inquisitor story itself.

55
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:56,439
I asked last time who had read it, and only one or two people, and apparently they weren't misled.

56
00:04:56,439 --> 00:05:21,240
But a famous case of somebody who should know better saying just the kind of stupid things that then get repeated over and over in the literature because they should know better, a guy named Verdayev, who was a friend of Dostoevsky's and a kind of early Russian existentialist, says the following: The legend of the Grand Inquisitor contains the best of the constructive part of Dostoevsky's religious ideas.

57
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:31,240
It is noteworthy that the extremely powerful vindication of Christ, which is what a legend is, should be put in the mouth of the atheist Ivan Karamatsov.

58
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:42,999
Well, when you discover that your view is as weird as that, that the Christ figure is being spelled out by the atheist, you may wonder whether you got it right.

59
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:50,840
But it never occurs, I guess, to Verdayev to wonder whether he got it right or all the people who think he must have got it right and go on like that.

60
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:56,759
The only way to find out is to look at the events very carefully.

61
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:59,399
And now we're connected up where we were last time.

62
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,439
I want to say that this is an antinomy.

63
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:08,279
That is, there's going to be, as on the chart, a thesis and an antithesis.

64
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:19,360
And in an antinomy, there is always, in an antinomy, each side, remember, argues for the truth of its view by showing the other side is impossibly, hopelessly wrong.

65
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:30,879
And since there are only two sides, the way an antinome is set up, they keep arguing back and forth, each one showing the other one must be right because the other one, they must be right because the other one is wrong.

66
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,920
And the way out of an antinome is to come up with some third possibility.

67
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,840
So just knowing the structure of the Grand Inquisitor helps you find your way.

68
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:51,119
Dostoevsky has sort of carefully, nicely, I mean, it's not a bad thing, hidden the structure to make it more like a poem, which is what he calls it.

69
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,079
But the structure is there as clear as day, and you can find it.

70
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:00,319
And so it's not just any old structure.

71
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:17,680
What's important to know from the start when you read it or reread it and reread it, because Dostoevsky has made it as complicated as possible, who are, I think you know already, the two, the thesis and the antithesis.

72
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:26,080
Well, the Grand Inquisitor is clearly the extreme version of the Roman Catholic Church, as Dostoevsky understands it.

73
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,079
And that's sort of obvious.

74
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:33,520
That's where Grand Inquisitors are, is in the Catholic Church.

75
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,720
And the other one is not much hard, is not much harder to find.

76
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:43,360
This is really where we left off last time on 279.

77
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,880
It's not just any old time that the book takes place.

78
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,800
It takes place in the 16th century.

79
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,760
And what happened that's relevant to this book and to us in the 16th century?

80
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,280
We talked about that.

81
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,360
They're at the bottom of 280.

82
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,520
And just then there appeared in the north of Germany a terrible new heresy.

83
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,880
And what is it?

84
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,160
It's Luther.

85
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,080
It's Protestantism.

86
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:11,800
It's the Reformation and so forth.

87
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,160
And so what are the two sides of the antinomy then?

88
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:21,400
Well, the Grand Inquisitor is the Catholic one, and his version of Jesus.

89
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:36,440
By the way, I'm not going to keep having to say this, but the way it's set up, just to say it once, it's Yvonne's story, in which there's a Grand Inquisitor, and the Grand Inquisitor, and Jesus, but Jesus never says anything, literally never says anything.

90
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:45,400
The Grand Inquisitor says through Jesus what he thinks Jesus would say or did say in the Bible and so forth.

91
00:08:45,400 --> 00:09:01,639
But if I quoted, every time I read something that showed you Jesus' views, I would have to say that Dostoevsky says that Yvonne says that the Grand Inquisitor says that Jesus says, that would be a bit of a mouthful.

92
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,040
So I'm just going to say Jesus says, though he doesn't actually say anything.

93
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,000
It doesn't matter because the Grand Inquisitor is quite correct.

94
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:23,079
Jesus, if you read him as an extreme Protestant, if you read him through Kierkegaard, for instance, a Lutheran, holds just the views that the Grand Inquisitor attributes to him.

95
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:24,600
He hasn't got it wrong.

96
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:42,120
So here are these two outrageously opposed and, it turns out, sort of each one hopelessly wrong views, going back and forth, trying, each one claiming that you've got to believe their story, either the Catholic story or the Protestant story.

97
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,680
And you can't get anywhere until you come up with a third possibility.

98
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,599
Now we're finally in new territory from where we ended last time.

99
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:58,800
And with the, I wish I didn't have to have a chart in front of you, because I would sort of ask you and put it on the board: don't cheat, don't look at the chart till after we talked about it.

100
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,400
What's the third possibility that's going to be, that's going to get us out of this antinomy?

101
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,120
Yeah.

102
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:15,120
Ah, so no, no, that's wrong, but that's good that somebody, it isn't, I thought it was a kind of no-brainer with the, but I mean, you're good, you didn't cheat, but it's not so.

103
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,720
What is it then?

104
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:18,559
It's the Russian Orthodox Church.

105
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,400
I mean, to us, that's pretty strange.

106
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:39,360
I mean, we don't think of that as a third kind of Christianity, but this book is being written in Russia for Russians, and it's the Russian Orthodox Church, which is the third possibility, which gets it, has a view which is the view of Dostoevsky and permeates the book.

107
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:53,680
And is supposedly, from Dostoevsky's point of view, the true Christianity from the early days of the early church before it got ruined by Platonism on the one hand or existentialism later on the other.

108
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,199
So now we're going to go into the two antinomies.

109
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:06,080
But just before we do, I had this hypothesis way, way, way back that that's, of course, how the book has to be read.

110
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,919
It's not even, you know, it's no big deal.

111
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,719
I'm not claiming I understood anything that wasn't right in front of you.

112
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:18,040
I showed you where he talks about the Lutherans.

113
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:26,160
Here on page 296, just to show you that I didn't make it up, about 20 lines from the bottom.

114
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,879
Alyasha says, and who will believe you about freedom?

115
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,119
Is that the way to understand it?

116
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:39,079
Alyasha is saying to Yvonne, against the views of both the Grand Inquisitor and the Jesus figure.

117
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:42,759
He says, Laliasha says, that's not the idea of it.

118
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,800
In the Orthodox Church, that's Rome.

119
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,320
So there you see the Orthodox Church versus Rome.

120
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:53,080
And then you just need, I just wanted to show you there is another view.

121
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:59,719
Now, there's also, and I discovered after I, it's nice if you figure something out and then you find a confirmation.

122
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,720
It's more of a confirmation than if you knew the confirmation first and then fitted things to it.

123
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:16,040
So once you see the three-fold structure, a letter from Dostoevsky shows up one day in a book I'm reading, and it's exactly what we want to hear.

124
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:25,959
So Dostoevsky says, as my answer to all this negative side, each side shooting down the other side, I had planned this sixth book, A Russian Monk.

125
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:27,559
That's the one we're going to read next.

126
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,640
That's the answer to the Grand Inquisitor.

127
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,800
And I'm trembling for it in this way.

128
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:40,200
Will it be an adequate answer, especially since it's not a direct answer to the stand expressed in the Grand Inquisitor?

129
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:41,559
Is it an answer point by point?

130
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,920
It's not an answer point by point, but only obliquely.

131
00:12:45,319 --> 00:12:46,680
So that's right.

132
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,680
I mean, that's how it is.

133
00:12:48,680 --> 00:13:01,239
If somewhere, it's like an Easter egg hunt in a way, somewhere tucked away in this book is the, is the Russian Orthodox Church answer to each of the antinomies in the Grand Inquisitor?

134
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:05,400
Every one of them gets explicitly dealt with.

135
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:13,479
And Dostoevsky, having his little fun, always tells you in so many words just which one.

136
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:20,079
So the one that didn't get dealt with because it didn't come up in the Grand Inquisitor is baptism.

137
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:32,559
But we saw how he makes absolutely clear with the German doctor that a childhood memory of being loved, putting you in the religious dimension, is the existentialized truth of baptism.

138
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:46,640
Well, now you have to keep your eyes open for, as you read, presumably hopefully ahead of where I am, the existentialized answer to each of the antinomy structures in the Grand Inquisitor.

139
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,959
And I didn't count them, but there are lots of them.

140
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:49,600
There's what?

141
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,520
One, well, there's maybe three or five, depending on how you count them.

142
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,680
So here we go.

143
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:08,400
But now we don't know, there's still, but now we need to know something about the basic opposition, the basic antinomy that you can generate all the others.

144
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:26,000
And then, and that is, first, Dostoevsky sets it up in terms of the three temptations of Jesus, to turn stones to bread, become a world leader by founding a church, produce faith by miracles.

145
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:32,800
And those are, each of those are going to generate oppositions.

146
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:47,199
Now, but the big deal opposition is, and that's at the top on the chart above the line, Jesus, the Protestant, says that people are godlike and free.

147
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:53,440
The antithesis, the Grand Inquisitor, the Roman Catholic, says people are weak and slavish.

148
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,519
That sort of goes across.

149
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,080
That's the basic antinomy.

150
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,600
Are people weak and worthless?

151
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:09,400
Here's a little clue, lackey-like, or are they pure, noble, free, lofty-like?

152
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:17,960
Now, when I put it that way, do you see any connection between who wrote this Grand Inquisitor legend and the legend?

153
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:32,040
Who's got the lackey side and the noble side sort of are having a struggle and can't get them together and would like to get rid of the lackey side?

154
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,160
All that is what, Yvonne thinking.

155
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,839
So Yvonne has written this.

156
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:39,319
I mean, and Dostoevsky's, it's not a mistake.

157
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:47,719
It's not sort of crazy like Bergaya thinks that this should be, Grand Inquisitor story should be put in the mouth of Yvonne.

158
00:15:47,719 --> 00:16:04,839
It's exactly Yvonne's problem in that he thinks that he is both lofty and lackey, and he wants to get rid of the weak, lackey, what are these, slavish side of himself.

159
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,880
So now I wanted to say on 291, well, maybe even before that.

160
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,799
Yeah, 287.

161
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:15,640
It's just amazing how it's scattered around in here.

162
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:17,400
Okay, here we are.

163
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:34,759
At the bottom of 287, here's the Grand Inquisitor says to Jesus, Thou didst promise them the bread of heaven, but I repeat again: can it be comparable with the earthly bread in the eyes of weak, of the weak, ever sinful, and ignoble race of man?

164
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:41,640
That's one thesis about it, about what we are: sinful, ignoble, and so forth.

165
00:16:41,640 --> 00:18:17,319
And the other thesis is Jesus wants them wants us to be pure and noble and assumes that we can be at the bottom of 291 yeah now here's the grand inquisitor's view about the few people who are noble uh but they are the ones that are not like all those weak ones they had borne thy cross the bottom of 291 they had endured scores of years in the hungry wilderness and thou mayest indeed point with pride at those children of freedom of free love of free and splendid sacrifice for thy name but remember that they were only some thousands of what about the rest so almost all human beings are weak and vicious and so forth a few of them are godlike and free but that the the what's the the church has got to do something for the weak ones and jesus is so perfect he has no sympathy for the weak the way the grand inquisitor sets it up for the weak worthless humanity so jesus makes these demands on people that treat them as if they were uh saints and that's what the grand inquisitor's got to fix uh where are we here the top of 285 four lines down for 15 centuries we have been we the church have been wrestling with thy freedom but now it's ended and over for good dost thou not believe that it's over for good?

166
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,079
No, that's not what i want.

167
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,479
Oh, this is yvonne saying about the grand inquisitor in the middle of 285.

168
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:31,160
He claims it's a merit for himself and his church that at last they vanquished freedom and have done it to make men happy.

169
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:37,400
That is, Jesus has asked so much of men that they can't live up to it.

170
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,439
I don't know if I really lived the right deal.

171
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:44,199
I haven't explained that clearly enough just a second.

172
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:47,400
The middle of 290 is better.

173
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:56,680
So the Grand Inquisitor says, Thou didst proudly and well like a god, but the weak, unruly race of men, are they gods?

174
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,400
And the answer is no, they're not.

175
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:07,559
They're miserable and weak, and so they need some kind of help, and now the Catholic Church is going to give it to them.

176
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,959
And all of this is summed up, this basic opposition.

177
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,999
We're still not doing any particular antinomy, although we're almost ready to.

178
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:29,240
We're just doing the big deal antinome, namely, Jesus's demand that people be free and strong and perfect, and the Grand Inquisitors claim that you can't ask that of people.

179
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:30,199
That's outrageous.

180
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:35,640
We're going to make it possible for them to be weak, the weak ones, even the weak ones to be happy.

181
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:42,119
But on 286, he goes back.

182
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:43,640
This won't become clear.

183
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,799
I can't explain it clearly yet.

184
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:56,600
But Dostoevsky is going to try to put in the three questions that the devil, or the three issues.

185
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,880
Will Jesus turn the stones into bread?

186
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,239
Will Jesus perform miracles like throwing himself off the temple to get people to believe in him?

187
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:07,640
Will he, what?

188
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:09,160
What's the third one?

189
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:10,519
What's that?

190
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,120
Rule the world.

191
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,119
Well, that's by turning stone into bread, feeding them, and letting them.

192
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,920
No, it's got to be a different one.

193
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:19,759
Wonder why?

194
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:27,039
I think it's creating a universal church in which everyone will believe the same thing, universal anthel.

195
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:32,400
So in those questions, should we do that or shouldn't we do that?

196
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:35,280
I don't care about that right now, those questions.

197
00:20:35,999 --> 00:20:57,519
The sentence that interests me is on the middle of 286, where the Grand Inquisitor says, in those three questions, namely, should he rule the world by making bread, get their faith by performing miracles, and create an objective truth that everybody can believe, in them is united all the unsolved historical contradictions of human nature.

198
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:59,759
I'm interested in the contradiction story.

199
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:06,079
Remember, Pascal says we're a contradiction, then Kierkegaard says the self is a contradiction.

200
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:16,479
Dostoevsky also thinks that there's a contradiction between the lofty and the lackey, if you like, or the angels and the insects, or the good and the bad.

201
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:18,640
We've seen all those contradictions.

202
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:35,359
And it's sort of trying to deal with those contradictions, to somehow do justice to the godlike, the free godlike side, and the weak, slavish side of the contradiction that all these antinomies happen.

203
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,519
And I want to say one more word just because it's something to think about.

204
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:41,999
Why does he say the historical contradictions?

205
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,840
You'd think if they're contradictions of human nature, they wouldn't be historical.

206
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,360
They'd be ahistorical.

207
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,199
That is, as soon as there were human beings, their contradictions would be there.

208
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,319
They'd be there as long as the human beings were there.

209
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,160
I don't have the answer to that.

210
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,239
I don't know what Dostoevsky is thinking.

211
00:21:58,239 --> 00:21:59,439
He doesn't explain it.

212
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:06,759
I think he's probably thinking, though, not just writing off the top of his head, because he's so deep and so smart.

213
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:22,680
One way to think about it is Kierkegaard's: that people didn't become contradictory until Jesus came along as the God-man and showed them that the finite and the infinite and the temporal and the eternal were equally important, equally essential.

214
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:27,880
That would mean that the contradictions started at a certain point in history and were only for a special culture.

215
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:34,920
I think the Buddhists probably don't have the contradictions of human nature raised in their culture.

216
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,160
That's one possible answer.

217
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,920
I don't know, really, I don't really know for sure what the answer is.

218
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,999
The Greeks would have only one side of the contradiction.

219
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:51,160
And so it would start only with the Hebrews and particularly with the Christians.

220
00:22:51,400 --> 00:23:04,120
And another thing he may mean by the historical contradictions is, and you have to see this at the very end of the book, where he gives you his story about how everything can be saved into a perfect world, which is we're in paradise here and now.

221
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:09,319
And one of the ways one of the characters would describe what might happen.

222
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:20,839
Anyway, that maybe Dostoevsky thinks that these contradictions of human nature go away if everybody lives in the right way and picks up the truth of Christianity.

223
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:26,759
So I guess, I mean, I like to think that Christianity is the disease for which it is the cure.

224
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:41,239
That once you get the God-man and you get the fact that the self is a contradiction and you have to do justice to both sides, then you get despair until you are able to do justice to both sides.

225
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:57,359
But happily, Christianity is the cure because if you relate to the God-man or relate to somebody else the way the God-man related to the freedom fighters or however you want to read it, the God-man not only causes you to be in this despair, but shows you the way out.

226
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:11,680
In the most abstract way to put it, is you can relate to yourself in a way that's harmonious and blissful, and Kierkegaard would say, is by relate to yourself by relating to another.

227
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:18,880
If you do that, if everybody did that in the right way, then the historical contradictions would be historical.

228
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,640
They'd be in the past.

229
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,880
There was a time when they weren't.

230
00:24:23,439 --> 00:24:29,999
If Christianity triumphs the way Dostoevsky pictures it at the end, his phrase is a star will arise in the East.

231
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:33,119
That means Russia will save the world in code.

232
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,320
And if that works, then their historical contradictions are really historical.

233
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,199
That's perhaps what it's about.

234
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:49,039
And now we're ready to talk about the three, all the antinomies.

235
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,160
I think I just want to see something I wrote down here.

236
00:24:52,880 --> 00:25:02,400
Yeah, we're ready to see now what happens when you spell out the various issues that the temptations were.

237
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:14,959
Spell them out as they look to people like Jesus who think that human beings are lofty and noble, and people who look, who think like the Grand Inquisitor that they are lacking and weak and ignoble.

238
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:16,959
So we start to spell them out.

239
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,640
There are three big antinomies.

240
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,719
And they are, wait, let me know.

241
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:27,119
I don't summon.

242
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,480
No, I just summed up the antinomies once more.

243
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:31,160
I'll do it very quickly.

244
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:35,719
So the antinomies turn out to be: give people total freedom and independence.

245
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:36,680
That's Jesus.

246
00:25:36,999 --> 00:25:41,079
People are only capable of slavery and dependence on authority.

247
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,680
That's the Grand Inquisitor.

248
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:49,080
If you stress the people being slavish and dependent on authority so much, it looks like, well, that can't be right.

249
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,759
We've got to do justice to their freedom and autonomy.

250
00:25:52,759 --> 00:26:01,640
And then you stress freedom and autonomy, you stress it so far, as Kierkegaard does, for instance, then it looks like nobody can do that.

251
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,719
We've got to treat them as slaves and make them happy as slaves.

252
00:26:05,719 --> 00:26:09,079
That's the flipping back and forth structure.

253
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:17,239
Okay, I'm going to stop there before I plunge into the structural details of all the different antinomies, because maybe somebody wants to say something.

254
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:20,199
Hopefully, I get tired of listening.

255
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,479
Are you with it?

256
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,479
Everybody looks with it, I must say.

257
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:25,319
Thank you for coming.

258
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,160
And shame on you podcasts, people who could have come and didn't.

259
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,160
And okay, I'm going on.

260
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,719
Okay.

261
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,160
So, first, the economic issues.

262
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:42,199
That's the question, political question, political, economic.

263
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:48,920
It's, you know, Jesus, why didn't Jesus turn the stones into bread and feed all the people?

264
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,959
And that would seem to be a good idea to do.

265
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,920
Then there's, I'm going to just read the three in a hurry.

266
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,920
Then there's the community issue.

267
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:14,119
That is, why doesn't he create a church which is the objective truth of Christendom, for instance, and unite everybody into one shared religion instead of all the fighting between all the different religions killing each other for thousands of years?

268
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:27,039
And finally, I'm going to call it the more, there's the economic issue, then there's the community issue, and that's something like also a story about objective truth.

269
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,279
And then there's the morality issue.

270
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:35,920
And that's got to do with confession and miracles and how people get and preserve their faith.

271
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,199
So here we go.

272
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:46,719
By the way, the first one, the economic one, is in a certain way the most brilliant in that he's foreseen the problems very well.

273
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:52,079
On the other hand, it's sort of boring because by the time we're reading it, everybody knows these problems.

274
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,039
And moreover, he hasn't got a very interesting solution.

275
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,320
But we have to look at it.

276
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,439
Not today, the solution, but at least today the problem.

277
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:01,839
So what's the problem?

278
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:08,959
Well, the problem is that in a world of scarcity, there's just not enough food to go around.

279
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:11,120
This is on 286.

280
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:21,119
The devil says, for nothing has ever about, eight lines from the bottom of 286, for nothing has ever been more insupportable for man and a human society than freedom.

281
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:28,719
But see thou these stones in this arched wilderness, turn them into bread, and mankind will run after you like a flock of sheep.

282
00:28:28,719 --> 00:28:31,680
Well, that's the temptation, all right.

283
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:36,079
But we have to spell out the two antinomies.

284
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:44,479
The two antinomies are: either you make everybody ascetic enough so that there is enough food to go around.

285
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:57,599
If they all could live on berries and mushrooms and insects, locusts, and so forth, like one of the characters in the book, there certainly wouldn't be a shortage of food to go around.

286
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:06,999
Or, and this is, and that's, and Jesus is in effect saying everybody has to be an ascetic, and then we've got rid of the food problem.

287
00:29:06,999 --> 00:29:25,319
The Grand Inquisitor says, well, in a planned economy in which everybody gives all that they can to the central authority, and then the authority gives it out to everybody as much as they need it, in Lenin terms, from each according to his ability, to each according to his need.

288
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:31,079
Dostevsky is inventing Leninism as he's inventing everything else as he goes along.

289
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,120
In that world, there won't be any hunger.

290
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,920
There won't be any people below the poverty line.

291
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,359
So now we just have to look at it.

292
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,400
I mean, that's what it's about.

293
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,039
Now I'll read you a passage or two.

294
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,640
About two-thirds down on 287 on the right-hand side.

295
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,920
No science will give them bread so long as they remain free.

296
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,759
This is the planned economy story.

297
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:57,160
In the end, they will lay their freedom at our feet and say to us, make us your slaves, but feed us.

298
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:03,160
They will understand at last that freedom and bread enough for all are inconceivable together.

299
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:19,880
That's the, you need some kind of socialist system that tells people what jobs to have and rations out the food and tells people where to live and educate some of them a lot and some of them not at all and so forth.

300
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:32,439
The whole Russian system, the communist system, not Russian really, but Soviet, that's what the Grand Inquisitor says is necessary if people are going to eat.

301
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:38,999
And some people, he's always grandpa, can be ascetics, but only a few.

302
00:30:38,999 --> 00:30:56,079
And that's what I read before, where there are some people at the top of 292 who can go be hungry in the wilderness living on locusts and roots, but there are only a few thousand of them, and there are billions of people.

303
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:02,799
So that asking everybody to be ascetic was just not going to work.

304
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,959
So you have to have a system that will feed everybody.

305
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:22,400
Weak, self-indulgent people who eat all they can instead of eating as little as possible will bring down this economy of scarcity unless, and they can't help but do that because they're too weak to be all ascetic.

306
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:27,360
Who wants to live on insects and locusts and mushrooms and so forth?

307
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,759
Not me, and not most people.

308
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:44,319
And so you've got to have, then, a science that's the planned economy science that will feed everybody a lot of good food, and that's it.

309
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,359
But of course, this is the punchline.

310
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,599
I'm not making it very clear, but I read it already.

311
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,759
Then they have to give up their freedom.

312
00:31:51,999 --> 00:31:58,800
That's what is implicit in what I said when I said you've got to tell people where to live, where to work, you've got to decide who goes to what school.

313
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:03,999
You can take out the best pianists and ballet dancers and chess players and treat them very well.

314
00:32:03,999 --> 00:32:06,160
You can treat a lot of other people very badly.

315
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:11,199
But as long as you feed them all, that's the most anybody can hope for.

316
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:16,239
So freedom and bread enough for all are incompatible.

317
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:26,239
And the antinomy is that either you have to give up the bread or you have to give up the freedom.

318
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:39,559
And that means you can have either a free market economy which gives people freedom or you can have a planned socialist economy that gives the people the bread.

319
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:45,079
And there seems to be no way to have both, but no way to get along with just one of them.

320
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,719
So, and the sort of, I guess I've read it.

321
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:52,279
I mean, I just think I've covered it, but let me see.

322
00:32:52,519 --> 00:33:07,880
So just one more way to put it, is from each according to his ability to each according to his need, they all hand in the result of their work to the central authority, who then doles it out to everybody according to how much food they need.

323
00:33:07,879 --> 00:33:09,880
This is the middle of 294.

324
00:33:09,879 --> 00:33:16,280
Receiving bread from us, they will see clearly that we take the bread made by their hands from them to give it to them.

325
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:18,760
And that's the end of that.

326
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:20,839
And I don't have more to say about that.

327
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,519
You want to know each time, so you should ask yourself now, figure it out when we get there.

328
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,840
I mean, what's Dostoevsky's answer?

329
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:31,320
I mean, he's right, he's brilliant.

330
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:37,719
I mean, either you have a free economy, in which case, does everybody get all the food they need?

331
00:33:37,719 --> 00:33:43,239
Is there anybody beneath the poverty line in our free economy?

332
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,680
Sure, there are.

333
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,640
There are hungry people.

334
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,559
There are people who are not getting enough food.

335
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:56,040
And Dad, but we're all very free to start our own companies, to live where we want to, to go to whatever school we can get into, and so forth.

336
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,239
And that's the freedom without the food.

337
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:06,840
And then you can picture a country, I suppose Cuba is like that, where there is nobody below the poverty line.

338
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:12,520
Everybody gets the food they need, not all the food they might want, but all the food they need anyway.

339
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:22,480
And nobody gets a free choice to start a company or to go and start a political party or publish a newspaper or do what any of the other things they might want to do.

340
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,160
Okay, that's it for that.

341
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,239
Now, maybe anybody want to say anything about that?

342
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:31,839
I mean, I'm going to just claim Dostoevsky's very good at seeing these two alternatives.

343
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,320
They really are the two alternatives.

344
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:40,080
It's very hard to have both freedom and feed everybody.

345
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:55,119
However, I just want to say, and why it's not interesting, is partly because, as I said, we know that, that a free country like ours doesn't feed everybody, and a country that does feed everybody won't be free.

346
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,719
But it isn't even true.

347
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:03,680
The Scandinavian countries have done pretty well at combining freedom and nobody below the poverty line.

348
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:09,360
And I mean, in Norway now, they do it by having an immense amount of richness from the North Sea oil.

349
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,639
But they manage it in Sweden too without the North Sea oil.

350
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:20,879
So in any case, it just it isn't it isn't absolutely convincing that you couldn't start some kind of political thing.

351
00:35:20,879 --> 00:35:27,520
But it doesn't matter because it's not what's really on Dostoevsky's mind in the Grand Inquisitor story.

352
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,680
So let's unless anybody has any objections, we'll go on.

353
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,439
Uh comments?

354
00:35:33,759 --> 00:35:34,640
Yeah, Beatrice.

355
00:35:34,879 --> 00:35:37,840
So it's that people are unhappy.

356
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,600
Only because they got no food, I should.

357
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,319
I mean, it's a deep thing to say people are unhappy when they're free.

358
00:35:42,319 --> 00:35:45,520
That's a an important thing, but I don't think it's a Dostoevsky thing.

359
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,480
Where do you find it?

360
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:52,799
Well, they will deteriorate that we take the brand made by the advent from them, we give it to them without any verifiable.

361
00:35:52,799 --> 00:35:55,959
Um they will see that there's no change the spread that truth.

362
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,080
They will be more thankful.

363
00:35:57,399 --> 00:35:58,759
Well, that's very interesting.

364
00:35:58,759 --> 00:35:59,359
Where is that?

365
00:35:59,879 --> 00:36:01,160
Okay, let me look at it.

366
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:06,760
I mean, then he's got another brilliant idea that I didn't even see, packed in all this dense stuff.

367
00:36:06,759 --> 00:36:11,799
There is what's there was a big, big popular, very popular book.

368
00:36:11,799 --> 00:36:16,279
It wasn't very big, when I was a student called Dreadful Freedom.

369
00:36:16,279 --> 00:36:20,919
But I mean, it was just one of a whole lot of books that were claiming people don't really want to be free.

370
00:36:20,919 --> 00:36:22,279
They want to be told what to do.

371
00:36:22,279 --> 00:36:24,840
They want governments to tell them what to do.

372
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,840
Freedom is too hard to take.

373
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:29,399
I didn't think Dostoevsky thought about that.

374
00:36:29,399 --> 00:36:31,400
But now I want to see where it is.

375
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,439
I still don't see it, but I believe you that it's there.

376
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,399
Tell me where again.

377
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:37,480
Middle of 294.

378
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,879
They see that the truth.

379
00:36:39,879 --> 00:36:44,599
The truth, they will be more thankful for taking it from our hands than for the bread itself.

380
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,559
Hmm.

381
00:36:45,799 --> 00:36:47,880
Let's go on and see where that leads us.

382
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,040
They will remember only too well the old days without our help, the bread that turned into stones.

383
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,400
And there while since they have come to us, the very stones have turned into bread.

384
00:36:55,399 --> 00:36:59,320
Too, too well they know the value of complete submission.

385
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:02,839
Well, I can see your way of reading it, and I really wish it were there.

386
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:10,920
Maybe it is, but it seems to me the value of complete submission isn't this interesting thing that people don't really want to be free.

387
00:37:10,919 --> 00:37:15,719
It's that freedom is something that's worth giving up freedom to get the bread.

388
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:26,199
And I just, if he's, he'd have to make a bigger fuss about it if he had this deep idea that people intrinsically don't want freedom.

389
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:27,879
I don't think he thinks that.

390
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:29,799
But if he does, then I need to find out.

391
00:37:29,799 --> 00:37:33,079
And I got a new, you've given me a new piece of my course.

392
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:33,319
Yeah.

393
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,119
Yeah, impossible because of the economic constraints.

394
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,560
If you make a free economy, then you can't feed everybody.

395
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:45,839
And therefore, either you give up freedom or people are going to starve.

396
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,440
I think that's the main line.

397
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,999
But there may be, because maybe onto something, a sub-line, but I have to keep my eye out for it.

398
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,959
Yeah, Chuck.

399
00:37:53,919 --> 00:37:54,960
Uh-oh.

400
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,559
I said they're ganging up on me.

401
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,760
Go ahead.

402
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,439
It's good.

403
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:13,040
We both agree with their ideas, but it's better for the church to bring out.

404
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:14,799
Mom and God, you're right.

405
00:38:14,799 --> 00:38:15,439
You're right.

406
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,840
It comes up in a different context.

407
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,079
It's in the morality section, right?

408
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,559
Instead of people, yes, now I recognize it.

409
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:41,920
It's minimal where you see it there, but it definitely comes out clearly when the church tells people what's right and wrong, and then they confess what they've done, then the church tells them whether how bad that was and what they should do about it, and then they do whatever the confessor says.

410
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:50,640
All of this is just the opposite of what they should be doing, namely freely deciding what's right and wrong and freely deciding whether they're guilty or not.

411
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,519
And that's right.

412
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,160
It comes out under the morality thing, which is really funny.

413
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:05,920
It's different than the way people were talking about it when I was a student, which was that there was something intrinsically frightening about freedom at all.

414
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:22,640
But this is much more plausible, that there is something people don't want, and in fact can't stand the kind of nihilism that would come if everybody were told that they were free to decide for themselves what was good and what was evil.

415
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,520
And I don't want it.

416
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,559
You don't want it either.

417
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:36,680
You want to live in a culture in which, in some way, the guidelines, at least, for good and evil are already in the in the way people behave and in the language and so forth.

418
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:42,280
And the Grand Inquisitor doesn't say it's in the practices, it's in the background.

419
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:46,999
He says you will the Church is going to just spell it out, which is what happened.

420
00:39:47,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I mean, the Catholic Church is going to take this sort of background understanding of good and evil and just say, look, the Bible says so-and-so, or we, the Church, the Pope, whoever, speaks, will tell you the answers to what's right and wrong.

421
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,759
Okay, that's we'll get to that.

422
00:40:04,759 --> 00:40:08,680
But you guys are on the right issue for the morality part.

423
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,919
But we've got to do next the community part.

424
00:40:10,919 --> 00:40:12,600
I don't know why it has to be next.

425
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,040
But you think I should say I should try, can I skip to the morality part?

426
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:17,799
I think that's risky the way I wrote it.

427
00:40:17,799 --> 00:40:19,799
Let me write it, redo it the way I wrote it.

428
00:40:19,799 --> 00:40:22,919
But otherwise, I'm going to maybe get in some loop.

429
00:40:22,919 --> 00:40:26,040
So next comes the community issue.

430
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:39,480
So the community issue is about whether each person can believe in God in his or her own, on his or own, or and without any community support, without any evidence, like miracles.

431
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:44,439
And the partisan view is that you don't need community in other people.

432
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,199
In fact, they get in the way.

433
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:51,000
What you need is to be an individual and all on your own.

434
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,680
And Luther already said each man is a pope.

435
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,760
Kierkegaard talks a lot about people being alone before God.

436
00:40:58,759 --> 00:41:03,640
And Kierkegaard also says Christianity has no objective validity.

437
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:11,880
That is, you can't go around and have a test whether, well, you can't even tell whether the God-man, Jesus, ever existed for sure.

438
00:41:11,879 --> 00:41:32,480
But even if you could historically find out that this Jesus lived and said the things that the Bible says he said, if there's no objective truth about whether he's Savior or God, Kierkegaard says, that depends on how much you are unconditionally committed to who whatever.

439
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,559
Your Savior and your God is whatever one you're unconditionally committed to.

440
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,080
So there's no objective truth in it at all.

441
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:46,080
And it's and you'll see that the Dostoevsky's already invented this.

442
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:59,360
So Kierkegaard, I'm not going to go on about the no more objective validity since you had that earlier in the course, but this business about being individual versus community, we didn't really talk about that.

443
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:16,880
That it's an obvious thing that in some way the community and the church play a big role in Roman Catholicism, and they play a much more marginal role in Protestantism, where Luther stands up alone against the church.

444
00:42:16,879 --> 00:42:33,280
And the idea that people can stand up alone against the whole society is something that the the the Grand Inquisitor doesn't like at all, but it's something that he attributes to the Jesus figure as causing a lot of trouble.

445
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:59,680
I just tell you all this about so um the way Kierkegaard ta talks about the public or what he say calls the herd is exactly the same view that the Grand Inquisitor attributes to Jesus, namely that when a bunch of people get together and believe something religious, it already spoils it.

446
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:05,719
That you should, you have to do it on your completely own direct relation to God.

447
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:07,719
Now, I was going to say something slipped my mind.

448
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:08,599
I don't want to.

449
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,079
Oh, yeah.

450
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,760
Kierkegaard says that, quote, there's no truth in the crowd.

451
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:20,840
I mean, what a bunch of people all together believe just isn't going to, it's always going to be sort of vainal, leveled, covered up.

452
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:25,719
All the truth that is discovered, that's really the truth, is discovered by individuals.

453
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:29,959
So here's the extreme version of that from Kierkegaard's attack on Christendom.

454
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:34,920
Remember, I said his last book is an attack on Christendom.

455
00:43:36,279 --> 00:43:44,920
The Christianity of the New Testament, this is Kierkegaard, is precisely reckoned upon and related to the isolation of the spiritual man.

456
00:43:44,919 --> 00:43:46,039
You've got to keep focused.

457
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,920
This is what Kierkegaard thinks that Jesus thinks.

458
00:43:48,919 --> 00:43:52,279
This is exactly what the Grand Inquisitor thinks that Jesus thinks.

459
00:43:52,279 --> 00:43:56,599
This is extrapolating Protestantism to its extreme.

460
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,640
So let me go on.

461
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:08,519
Christianity in the New Testament consists in loving God and hatred to man, in hatred to oneself and to other men, hating father and mother, one's own wife and child, etc.

462
00:44:08,919 --> 00:44:12,440
The strongest expression of the most agonizing isolation.

463
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:18,760
And it is in view of this, I say, that such men, men of this quality and caliber, are not born anymore.

464
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:26,199
It's just totally amazing how much that's the view that the Grand Inquisitor attributes to Jesus.

465
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:46,160
And even a sort of Grand Inquisitor view at the end, that people aren't up to it, because what the Grand Inquisitor, after attributing this amazing view, it comes from the Bible where Jesus says, I have no mother and father and brothers and sisters when they come and say your family wants you, and he's out d busy saving people, and that just isn't going to cut any ice with him.

466
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,839
And he just says, I've got no family.

467
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:51,119
And Kierkegaard is just running with that.

468
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,800
And Dostoevsky is putting it as the Protestant view.

469
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:02,640
And the Grand Inquisitor says, men of that quality don't exist anymore, so we've got to fix it up.

470
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:14,880
Instead of asking the Christians that they should live in isolation, the Grand Inquisitor is going to produce one big conformist community, Christendom, the church.

471
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:24,480
And he's going to save people from a kind of craving for community.

472
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,239
Sorry, what?

473
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,520
Oh, yeah, that's right.

474
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,640
There's a step in between.

475
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:33,760
The Grand Inquisitor says people can't do these things on their own that Jesus is asking to do.

476
00:45:33,759 --> 00:45:41,040
So they form smaller religious groups, and each of them claimed to be the true one.

477
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,440
And then they start killing each other off.

478
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,040
There are the anxieties of sinfulness.

479
00:45:47,279 --> 00:45:51,280
Everybody accuses the other one of being the bad guys.

480
00:45:51,279 --> 00:45:59,840
So the Grand Inquisitor is going to solve the whole problem, namely, people can't live in isolation, people form opposed communities and kill each other.

481
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:04,400
He's going to fix all that by producing one big universal community.

482
00:46:04,399 --> 00:46:08,160
I mean, that was really the vision of Christendom not too long ago.

483
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:09,920
Certainly is gone now.

484
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:19,360
But the idea was that everybody was going to get converted, and then they were all going to agree, and nobody was, there weren't going to be any religious wars and people killing each other off.

485
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:23,719
And this is what the Grand Inquisitor claims the church is going to produce.

486
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:28,639
On 288, about 20 lines from the bottom.

487
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:37,000
For these pitiful creatures, they're concerned not only to find something that they would all believe in and worship, what is essential is that they all should be in it together.

488
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:44,760
This craving for community of worship is the chief misery of every man individually and all humanity from the beginning of time.

489
00:46:44,759 --> 00:46:53,079
For the sake of common worship, they have slain each other with the sword, meaning they want everybody to believe what they believe in their group.

490
00:46:53,080 --> 00:47:00,280
They have set up gods and challenged one another, put away your gods and come and worship ours, or we'll kill you and your gods.

491
00:47:00,279 --> 00:47:02,759
That's the view, that's how people have acted.

492
00:47:02,759 --> 00:47:06,280
And it does seem that's right, that they have acted that way.

493
00:47:06,279 --> 00:47:08,119
And the church is going to fix it.

494
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:14,680
So you get to 293, about 10 lines down.

495
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:22,280
That is someone to worship, someone to keep his conscience, a means of uniting all, and this is the crucial part.

496
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:34,840
Some means of uniting all in one unanimous and harmonious ante because the craving for universal unity is the third and last anguish of men.

497
00:47:34,839 --> 00:47:40,039
This, by the way, Dostoevsky puts it third, I've put it second.

498
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,040
So you see the point.

499
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,719
I wonder what the Russian says, a minor point.

500
00:47:45,719 --> 00:47:46,839
Is there an ant heap?

501
00:47:46,839 --> 00:47:48,040
I never heard of an ant heap.

502
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:51,559
I think it's an anthill, but in my dialect.

503
00:47:51,560 --> 00:48:01,640
But in any case, it's just a story that everybody's behaving in this kind of totally unindividualized, totally community way.

504
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,160
That's what the Grand Inquisitor thinks is the solution.

505
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,680
Any comments on that?

506
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,279
Because now we've finished community.

507
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,600
We'll come back to each of these because you still have to ask, well, what is Dostoevsky's answer?

508
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,439
I just want to keep you asking the question.

509
00:48:14,799 --> 00:48:22,880
Are you going to make people as individual and able to stand on their own as possible, the Jesus demand?

510
00:48:22,879 --> 00:48:38,640
Or are you going to try to create one universal church, which won't be Christendom anymore, but maybe, I don't know, worship the earth and save the planet, but some universal thing that everybody can believe in so that they don't all blow each other up?

511
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,719
Or is there some possible third way to do things?

512
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:44,159
We will see.

513
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,559
Okay, now the morality issue.

514
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:50,960
And now under morality, there are four subcategories.

515
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,359
Well, if you look over here, let me see where we are in the chart.

516
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,839
I'm just going to make sure I've got it all up here.

517
00:48:58,399 --> 00:48:59,759
Never mind the third column.

518
00:48:59,759 --> 00:49:00,239
That's all.

519
00:49:00,879 --> 00:49:02,319
Don't even think about that.

520
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:04,880
That's the Russian Orthodox.

521
00:49:04,879 --> 00:49:10,480
So, okay, why under morality have I got only two of the four?

522
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:20,320
I've got confessions and miracles, whereas Dostoevsky has confession, miracles, mystery, and authority.

523
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:27,520
Now, that's one of the paper topics, because I haven't the slightest idea what the answer is.

524
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:34,400
After, I don't know, 40 years of teaching it, I still don't know what the antinome is for mystery.

525
00:49:36,799 --> 00:49:47,279
One wants to know what is the church's view of mystery, what is the Catholic Church's view of history, I mean, what is the Protestant view of mystery, and what is Dostoevsky's view of mystery.

526
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,880
The same for authority.

527
00:49:48,879 --> 00:49:53,760
So, if anybody can answer that question, do one or the other, it's hard enough.

528
00:49:53,759 --> 00:49:57,120
And show me the passages where I bet it's in here.

529
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,280
I mean, the structure of the book is so rigorous.

530
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,600
And if he mentions them, and he never answers any of these directly.

531
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:20,839
But if you do get the right answer, don't write your paper unless you could find in the vicinity of the answer Dostoevsky clobbering you over the head in some funny roundabout way, like the German for the baptism, and you'll see another one in a minute, or next time maybe.

532
00:50:20,839 --> 00:50:29,640
Anyway, find the answer and find the way Dostoevsky says, look, here's the answer, and you get an A plus, and you get to be part of the course from now on.

533
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:33,159
Yeah, I would think so, but it's got to be worked out more.

534
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,880
I mean, where does he say that?

535
00:50:35,879 --> 00:50:38,360
And what sort of authority?

536
00:50:38,359 --> 00:50:40,599
And it's got to be a lot to do with the answer.

537
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:53,000
I should put it this way: show me in the book where the proper kind of authority is exhibited, not the authority of the top-down Catholic and not everybody on their own.

538
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,600
I think it's around.

539
00:50:54,600 --> 00:51:07,320
I mean, if we're supposed to believe his letter, then somewhere in the Zosima part, all those chapters when Zosima is telling his philosophy, we ought to be able to see Zosima's view of authority.

540
00:51:07,319 --> 00:51:09,160
And that ought to be the answer.

541
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:13,800
And he ought to be able to, and you ought to see in the vicinity something that says, here's the answer.

542
00:51:13,799 --> 00:51:16,839
And so let's hope somebody figures it out.

543
00:51:16,839 --> 00:51:18,360
I would love to see.

544
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:23,879
I think mystery is even harder, because I don't quite know what mystery is for.

545
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:32,920
You're right, the authority part is clear what the Catholic Church thinks the Pope and the rest of the Church is the authority.

546
00:51:32,919 --> 00:51:35,799
And the Protestant says, you're the only authority.

547
00:51:35,799 --> 00:51:37,160
Every man is a Pope.

548
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:40,840
And the interesting issue becomes, what's the solution?

549
00:51:40,839 --> 00:51:43,800
But for mystery, I don't even know what the question is.

550
00:51:43,799 --> 00:51:45,999
What's the Protestant view of mystery?

551
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:47,919
And even what is the Catholic view of mystery?

552
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:48,719
Not miracles.

553
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:50,799
That's a different thing, but mystery.

554
00:51:50,799 --> 00:51:52,480
Anyway, there's my speech.

555
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,520
I really, really seriously want to know the answer to this one.

556
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,560
And I suspect sooner or later somebody's going to tell me.

557
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:09,440
Okay, so in the meantime, let's do what we know how to do, and that is the other two: miracle and confession.

558
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:17,440
Those are the two most interesting of all of the antinomies because their solution is so brilliant and plausible.

559
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,120
And the antinomy is so plausible.

560
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,279
Everything gets better and better from here on.

561
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,359
Only for now, I think we've lost it.

562
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,959
Oh, no, I see where we are.

563
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:25,600
Okay.

564
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:29,760
We're on to confession.

565
00:52:29,759 --> 00:52:32,239
Confession isn't always on the list.

566
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:33,919
Did I read the middle of 292?

567
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:34,479
I must have.

568
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,840
No, I don't think I did.

569
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:42,319
So for this paper topic, the place where the mystery and authority are is the middle of 292.

570
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,160
You might want to write it on the paper topics.

571
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,160
I was going to, but I think I didn't.

572
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:55,120
It says, the Grand Inquisitor says, we have corrected thy work and have founded it upon miracle, mystery, and authority.

573
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,160
And confession gets treated in another place.

574
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,040
We're going to do the confession right now.

575
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:17,280
So, everybody, okay, so now we're down to having, we're in the third morality, and we're in the confession part, A under 3 by my picture.

576
00:53:17,279 --> 00:53:18,799
Okay, so what happened?

577
00:53:18,879 --> 00:53:19,680
What is the story?

578
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:26,960
Jesus, according to the Grand Inquisitor, demands that people must get along without moral support and moral guidance.

579
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:34,440
Kierkegaard on confession says that confession is a bad thing.

580
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,199
You shouldn't have an institution like confession.

581
00:53:38,199 --> 00:53:45,719
And the Grand Inquisitor says confession is necessary for these weak human beings.

582
00:53:46,199 --> 00:53:47,079
Let's do it again.

583
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:54,120
So the Grand Inquisitor says people have to be able to confess and be pardoned and forgiven and so forth.

584
00:53:54,120 --> 00:54:16,040
And the Jesus figure says that's an immoral temptation that people have to face their guilt individually before God, not some authority figure like the priest or who is going to just decide for them when they can listen to them when they confess.

585
00:54:16,919 --> 00:54:21,880
And Kierkegaard is again perfectly like Jesus in the Grand Inquisitor.

586
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:31,239
Again, I just want to stress how amazingly Dostoevsky has sort of extrapolated the Protestant individualism to the utter limit.

587
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:37,800
Here's what he says, again in the Attack on Christendom: Every human being is gloriously constituted.

588
00:54:38,120 --> 00:55:02,440
What ruins so many is, among other things, this wretched tittle-tattle between man and man about what should be suffered and matured in silence, this confession before men instead of before God, this hardy communication between this man and that about what ought to be kept secret and exists only before God in secrecy, this impatient craving for intermediary consolation.

589
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,799
So there you'll have it.

590
00:55:03,799 --> 00:55:14,600
I mean, it ruins people to have this opportunity to dump their problems off or get them off their chest talking to some other human being.

591
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:31,680
Jesus says that every man must make his own free choices and then accept the guilt or not, or then decide on their own guilt or non-guilt before God and only that.

592
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:54,480
But even just the New Testament already makes an important move, according to Dostoevsky, which the Protestants take up, where Jesus says you don't have to obey the law anymore, that the law has been fulfilled in Jesus, and that you now can talk like Augustine love and do what you will.

593
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:03,760
But that makes it all the harder, because without any law, like in the Old Testament, there aren't any clear guidelines.

594
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:07,199
And even, I mean, just loving doesn't tell you what to do.

595
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:10,959
Are you going to use tough love or soft love and so forth?

596
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:11,919
All that's up to you.

597
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,399
There's no list of rules, right?

598
00:56:14,879 --> 00:56:16,000
Who gets what?

599
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,800
So this is the bottom of 289, about eight lines from the bottom.

600
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:34,799
In place of the rigid ancient law, man must hereafter, with free heart, hereafter meaning after the New Testament, with free heart decide for himself what is good and what is evil, having only thy image before him as a guide.

601
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:40,719
That's what he thinks, that's what the Grand Inquisitor thinks, that Jesus thinks.

602
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:55,600
So Jesus, there's no way of publicly justifying one's beliefs about what's good and bad, or deciding whether, or finding out whether what one did was good and bad.

603
00:56:55,600 --> 00:57:01,800
It's another way to see that what's higher than the ethical is something that suspends the ethical.

604
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:12,120
And there you get Abraham wandering alone, unable to explain in the shared language, even to himself, what he did, because all he can say is that he's a murderer.

605
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:23,960
I mean, the whole Kierkegaard suspension of the ethical is in here, in that sentence, really, that you can't have any support from the universal.

606
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,600
You've got to be an individual.

607
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:31,879
And the church understands that nobody can do that crazy thing.

608
00:57:31,879 --> 00:57:42,280
Kierkegaard's gone too far with this Abraham wandering alone in isolation, totally as if insane, unable to even explain to himself because it's universal.

609
00:57:42,919 --> 00:57:46,199
He can't, all intelligibility is universal.

610
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:50,920
So being an individual is really to be unintelligible.

611
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,319
You have to suspend the ethical.

612
00:57:53,879 --> 00:58:00,279
You heard all that, but it now comes back in a way that for Dostoevsky things thinks this is craziness.

613
00:58:00,279 --> 00:58:02,040
This can't be Christianity.

614
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:15,880
So now, on 295, the Grand Inquisitor says, the middle of the page, the most secret, the most painful secrets of their conscience, all they will bring to us, and we shall have an answer for all.

615
00:58:15,879 --> 00:58:24,760
And they will be glad to believe our answer, for it will save them from the great fear and terrible agony they endure at present in making a free decision for themselves.

616
00:58:24,759 --> 00:58:26,680
That's part of the freedom issue.

617
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:32,600
Again, people don't want to make a free decision for themselves.

618
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,239
They want the church to make it for them.

619
00:58:35,239 --> 00:58:41,320
And the Grand Inquisitor says, okay, we'll take responsibility for defining good and evil.

620
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,559
A little lower on 295.

621
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:50,879
There will be thousands of millions of happy ones and 100,000 sufferers who take it upon themselves the curse of the knowledge of good and evil.

622
00:58:51,600 --> 00:59:01,600
That is, there will be millions, really, of people who are happy to go and let the church tell them what's good and evil.

623
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:06,959
And there will be a few of these people, like the Grand Inquisitor, who know that there's no answer to what's good and evil.

624
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,320
They just make one up and pass it around.

625
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:17,840
So it says, peacefully they will die, peacefully in thy name, and beyond the grave they will find nothing but death.

626
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:23,280
That we shall keep the secret, and for their happiness we shall allure them with the reward of heaven and eternity.

627
00:59:23,279 --> 00:59:29,040
So that's a whole picture of the way the church makes life easy for people.

628
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:38,239
And the Grand Inquisitor thinks they should be sort of rewarded for that, because that's what people need.

629
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:39,439
Now, wait one second now.

630
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,320
I'm going to say one more sentence and then one more sentence again.

631
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:49,440
Remember, and this is a really important one this time, what is Dostoevsky's answer to confession?

632
00:59:49,759 --> 00:59:52,800
Is he for it, or is he against it?

633
00:59:52,799 --> 01:00:07,680
Or is there some, how could there be a third position, which is neither confession a la the Catholic Church, nor suffering before God and deciding whether you're guilty or not, and then suffering if you are.

634
01:00:08,399 --> 01:00:14,640
And there is a whole story about confession in here in the Zosima part.

635
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:21,440
You find it, and in it, Dostoevsky tells you exactly that he is existentialized confession.

636
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,960
Now, go ahead.

637
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,479
No, I think the secret is no miss.

638
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:26,559
Well, maybe.

639
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:30,759
I mean, I'm in no position to talk you out of it because I don't know what the right answer is.

640
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:38,920
It seems to me here the secret is simply that there is no right and wrong, and the church has just made it up.

641
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:41,319
That doesn't sound very mystery-ish.

642
01:00:41,319 --> 01:00:43,959
Of course, it's not going to be the right title.

643
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:47,239
Don't give it up just because I don't know what to make of it.

644
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,160
Okay, I'm ready to do the last one, and we just have the right amount of time.

645
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,159
And this is the best one of all.

646
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:58,199
You won't get the answer today, because there isn't time.

647
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:01,160
But it's an amazing presumption.

648
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:01,879
Think of this.

649
01:01:01,879 --> 01:01:09,080
Dostoevsky is going to give you, I haven't really said this clearly enough, an existentialized version of bread.

650
01:01:09,319 --> 01:01:14,280
Where are you going to get it from, from the Christian, from a Russian Orthodox perspective?

651
01:01:14,279 --> 01:01:16,840
How are you going to get bread and freedom together?

652
01:01:17,399 --> 01:01:21,080
From an existentialized Russian Orthodox perspective?

653
01:01:21,879 --> 01:01:27,800
How are you going to get the need for community, for shared intelligibility together with individuality?

654
01:01:27,799 --> 01:01:29,560
He's got a story.

655
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:40,520
And how are you going to have confession without sort of undermining somebody's sort of individual freedom and moral responsibility?

656
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,719
He's got a story.

657
01:01:41,719 --> 01:01:45,239
But now, for the miracle, how could he possibly have an existential?

658
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:50,600
After all, isn't a miracle something that goes against the laws of physics and chemistry?

659
01:01:50,600 --> 01:02:13,800
And the whole point of existentializing everything is to get it out of the out of the science business, out of the physics and chemistry business, so that when we discover more about neurons and whether, you know, the latest thing, whether when you freely make a decision, your brain hasn't made it a few milliseconds before you consciously make it, all kinds of weird things like that.

660
01:02:13,799 --> 01:02:29,839
We're supposed to get those issues, the phenomenology, the existential point out of these things, and not ever get into having to take a view on the neurons, or, for instance, whether there was a big bang or not.

661
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:33,839
We're not supposed to think that that's going to settle the question of creation.

662
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:35,600
Anyway, I'm getting sidetracked.

663
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:35,919
Sorry.

664
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:37,199
Now I'll get back on this.

665
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:38,560
Here we are.

666
01:02:38,879 --> 01:02:41,839
Why is the miracle thing so interesting and important?

667
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:49,760
How can he have an existentialized miracle when existentialized means non-magical?

668
01:02:49,759 --> 01:02:55,680
When the whole point of miracles is that somehow the laws of nature get interrupted and something magical happens.

669
01:02:55,839 --> 01:03:05,839
You get Lazarus coming forth from the grave after he'd been buried for a week, or Jesus was supposed to throw himself off from the temple and not get hurt.

670
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:09,920
Those are real big deal miracles, all right, in a certain sense.

671
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:15,120
They really just show that you can violate the laws of physics and chemistry if you're a God.

672
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,840
But that's not what Dostoevsky thinks.

673
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:25,199
So he has to produce a miracle that is really a miracle and doesn't violate the laws of physics and chemistry.

674
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:28,640
Now, I can't tell you the answer yet, but I can read you the problem.

675
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:39,280
So the problem is whether people can continue to believe without miracles to have faith, to give them faith.

676
01:03:39,279 --> 01:03:43,840
And it looks like those ought to be miracles against the laws of physics and chemistry.

677
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:47,600
So 390, that's about 15 lines from the bottom.

678
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:50,799
Is the nature of men such that they can reject miracles?

679
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:59,680
And that the great moments of their life, the moments of their deepest, most agonizing spiritual difficulties, cling only to the free verdict of the heart.

680
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:09,000
There's somebody in here, you've got to find it, who is going to be in agonizing spiritual difficulties.

681
01:04:09,319 --> 01:04:15,960
And you want to ask yourself, does he, it's a guy, does he need miracles?

682
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:18,599
Because, well, I won't fool you.

683
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:27,160
I mean, it's Alyasha, because it's got to be somebody who's super good, super strong, really the best kind of human being that you could have.

684
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:37,960
And the question is: does that best kind of human being need miracles when they're in spiritual difficulties, or do or can they just remain free?

685
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:41,479
And so you've got to watch Alyasha and see what happens.

686
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,000
That's the first thing.

687
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,719
And the Grand Inquisitor says that people do need miracles.

688
01:04:47,719 --> 01:04:52,360
And he says it on 292 in the middle.

689
01:04:52,359 --> 01:04:56,839
He says, We've corrected thy work and have founded it upon miracle, mystery, and authority.

690
01:04:56,839 --> 01:04:58,120
We're back to that again.

691
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,840
And we're now throwing in the miracle part.

692
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:08,120
So, and then when we next time, well, maybe we're going to get close to it this time.

693
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,239
I'm not sure yet.

694
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:10,120
So I won't.

695
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:14,359
But anyway, when we do, when we do all this, no, we won't get to the miracles.

696
01:05:14,359 --> 01:05:22,199
But when we do all this, you have to ask yourself again: and when does DSC does this existentializing of miracle?

697
01:05:22,199 --> 01:05:24,760
How does he tell you that that's what he's just done?

698
01:05:24,759 --> 01:05:26,280
That's the fun part.

699
01:05:26,279 --> 01:05:30,279
How does he, you know, smuggle it in and hit you over the head with it?

700
01:05:30,279 --> 01:05:31,959
That was the mirror.

701
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:35,239
You'll see all that in due course, but not quite yet.

702
01:05:35,239 --> 01:05:51,440
First, when we're now done with the Grand Inquisitor story as setting up the antinomy, what's now going to happen is that you're going to look in Father Zosima's story about sort of answers to this antinomy.

703
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:55,520
Some of them are there, some of them are hidden in other parts of the book.

704
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,199
Well, but most of them are there.

705
01:05:57,199 --> 01:05:58,559
But the miracle one isn't there.

706
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:03,840
Don't look for the miracle one is not in Father Zosima's talk.

707
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:08,319
And neither is the Incarnation, and neither is the founding of the church.

708
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:12,559
A lot of existentializing goes on outside of Zosima.

709
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:20,000
But Dzostovsky in his letter says that you should be looking in Zosima for the answer to the Grand Inquisitor, so you better look.

710
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,120
And maybe there's a miracle answer in there, too, but I've never seen it.

711
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,640
I think it's elsewhere.

712
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:32,000
Okay, so now I want to say a general sort of thing about the Grand Inquisitor story.

713
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:35,440
I've said it already, but I think I have to say it again.

714
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,320
It's really Yvonne's story.

715
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:53,520
That is, it really hinges on a sharp distinction between the lofty and the lacy, between human beings as super strong, impeccable, free, and all that, and human beings as weak and worthless.

716
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:57,840
And Yvonne really lives in that problem.

717
01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:12,480
And of course, thinks that he can, if he works at it, get rid of all that's weak and lacy and become just the kind of pure, free figure that he thinks in his story that Jesus wants him to be.

718
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:26,319
And the enemy for Yvonne is the Catholic Church, who would treat people as if they were weak when uh the point w is to sort of force them all to be free and strong like Yvonne.

719
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:32,759
Uh and he wants them to be perfect and godlike, not disgusting and worthless.

720
01:07:33,079 --> 01:07:50,600
And but Yvonne himself also agrees with the Grand Inquisitor because he's perfect and strong and feels sorry for or disdains everyone else.

721
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,959
So Yvonne, that's Yvonne's picture of what he wants to be.

722
01:07:53,959 --> 01:07:56,839
Now I'm preparing you for something I don't understand.

723
01:07:56,839 --> 01:07:59,479
I didn't put it on the paper topics, but we could have.

724
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:23,640
There's an interesting scene at the end of the Grand Inquisitor story where Jesus kisses the Grand Inquisitor, having listened to this whole rant from the Grand Inquisitor about how Jesus and his Catholic Church have totally ruined people by making them weak and slavish because he's just assuming that they are and building things to help them be that way.

725
01:08:23,959 --> 01:08:27,799
Why does Jesus kiss the Grand Inquisitor?

726
01:08:27,799 --> 01:08:29,560
Well, I don't know.

727
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:34,999
Let's have a discussion of it for the next five or ten minutes.

728
01:08:34,999 --> 01:08:36,839
I'll give you some suggestions.

729
01:08:36,839 --> 01:08:45,560
Is it because of the Inquisitor's purity, his good intentions, his lofty self, the way the Grand Inquisitor presents himself?

730
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:58,199
He's the guy who can live on the berries and locusts, but he goes and takes on the heavy job of setting up a church just so as to help all these weak people that can't take care of their own lives.

731
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:03,400
And Jesus recognizes that they're they're the good intentions of that.

732
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:07,479
The Grand Inquisitor is, in a way, the defender and helper of the weak.

733
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:12,759
But the and but the Grand Inquisitor and the Grand Inquisitor doesn't accept the world as it is.

734
01:09:12,759 --> 01:09:16,560
Yvonne wants to kill himself because of the way the world is.

735
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:18,560
But the Grand Inquisitor is even better.

736
01:09:19,119 --> 01:09:22,159
He wants to fix up the mess that's left by Jesus.

737
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:38,079
Insofar as the world is a mess because people are weak and so forth, you give them lots of moral guidelines like don't torture children and you check up on them when they confess and you tell them you can't do that anymore or you're going to go to hell.

738
01:09:38,079 --> 01:09:42,959
And so Jesus is trying to, or the church is trying to fix things up.

739
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:44,879
Now, I don't know, what do you think about that?

740
01:09:44,879 --> 01:09:49,360
I mean, anybody got their own views about why Jesus kisses the Grand Inquisitor?

741
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:52,959
I mean, Yvonne doesn't give us a hint in his story.

742
01:09:52,959 --> 01:09:53,600
Yeah.

743
01:09:56,799 --> 01:09:58,480
Yes, it's blasphemous, all right.

744
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:03,600
But of course, Yvonne, Yvonne writes the story.

745
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:08,319
He could be saying, you know, if blasphemy is what is appropriate.

746
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:25,839
I mean, the way the church gets set up by the Protestants is so utterly destructive of normal people that the Grand Inquisitor is brave enough to just take it on himself to see that that's wrong and to try to fix it.

747
01:10:25,839 --> 01:10:30,319
That's what Yvonne would do if he weren't just trying to get out of the world altogether.

748
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,440
You want to say something?

749
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,159
I saw another hand.

750
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:33,039
Was it your hand?

751
01:10:33,039 --> 01:10:33,360
Yeah.

752
01:10:35,039 --> 01:10:40,799
Where Jesus realizes that the Grand Inquisitor doesn't have his attention to worry about it.

753
01:10:41,119 --> 01:10:41,999
Well, maybe.

754
01:10:41,999 --> 01:10:45,440
I thought of that, and I can't, I mean, I'll repeat it.

755
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:58,560
That maybe the point is that just as Osima bowed down before Dimitri for the great suffering in store for him, so that Jesus sees that there's going to be a lot of suffering for the Grand Inquisitor.

756
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,159
You see, I don't really see that Dostoevsky thinks that.

757
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:07,959
The Grand Inquisitor's really, he's creating a lot of suffering, all right, but it's not in store for him.

758
01:11:07,959 --> 01:11:13,159
He's, and it's not even, I mean, not even like that he's creating a lot of suffering.

759
01:11:13,159 --> 01:11:17,799
And the way it's set up by Yvonne, I mean, he's getting rid of a lot of suffering.

760
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,799
I don't think the issue is suffering.

761
01:11:19,799 --> 01:11:22,119
But I mean, I don't have any knockdown argument.

762
01:11:22,119 --> 01:11:23,399
I'm just not convinced.

763
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:24,359
That's true.

764
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:26,520
So he's taking, ah, you're good, good.

765
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:41,959
So he's taking on the suffering that comes from having to lie to everybody, to listen to their confessions, and of course, to have nobody to confess to and no belief in the afterlife and so forth.

766
01:11:41,959 --> 01:11:44,039
And therefore, good.

767
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:44,759
I see.

768
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:46,439
That's a possibility.

769
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:47,239
Yeah.

770
01:11:47,959 --> 01:11:48,600
Yeah.

771
01:11:51,799 --> 01:11:56,039
So maybe one, Jesus does have some struggle.

772
01:11:56,039 --> 01:11:56,999
There's one maybe.

773
01:11:56,999 --> 01:11:59,239
But maybe that struggle comes out of the breath.

774
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:03,159
And you can tell one way of interpreting one thing with that, but it's one of the grand interpretations.

775
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:03,959
I mean, it's true.

776
01:12:03,959 --> 01:12:08,999
What you're saying, it's true that you can have lots of other interpretations.

777
01:12:09,159 --> 01:12:13,719
I mean, by the end of the day, like Jesus does.

778
01:12:13,879 --> 01:12:18,039
So maybe it's not that Jesus kissed.

779
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:25,560
Yeah, maybe the real Jesus, in other words, not the one that the Grand Inquisitor attributes to Jesus, kisses him.

780
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:27,480
Well, that's another possible move.

781
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:28,600
Beatrice, yeah.

782
01:12:28,919 --> 01:12:30,039
I was going to say that.

783
01:12:30,039 --> 01:12:31,399
We still have four minutes.

784
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:32,199
What do we get?

785
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:44,199
It further, it may help that Alyasha plagiarizes the kiss and kisses Yvonne, who wrote the story of the Grand Inquisitor, including the kiss at the end.

786
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,479
And what are we supposed to get out of that?

787
01:12:48,079 --> 01:12:52,480
Yvonne sort of kisses himself, in a sense, because he wrote this.

788
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,839
No, no, sorry, that's wrong.

789
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:59,359
If Yvonne kisses himself, it's because the cancel it at all.

790
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,319
Alyasha kisses Yvonne.

791
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:03,279
What does he see?

792
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,680
Partly, maybe the great suffering in store for him.

793
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:09,199
That would be one line to follow your version.

794
01:13:09,759 --> 01:13:21,359
Another is to go back to say that he sees Yvonne's purity and good intentions side of Yvonne, and he's sort of supporting that.

795
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,999
I wrote some things down about this.

796
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:24,959
Let's see.

797
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:29,999
Alyasha sees Yvonne's good motives and hopes that he'll work it out.

798
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:35,199
It doesn't mean when he kisses Yvonne that he thinks Yvonne is right, that's sure.

799
01:13:35,759 --> 01:13:39,919
But here I wrote the kiss is not like Zosima bowing to the ground before Dimitri.

800
01:13:39,919 --> 01:13:44,399
Yvonne and the Grand Inquisitor think that some men are lofty and some base.

801
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:47,600
Well, Dimitri understands that everyone is both.

802
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,119
I don't know if that's relevant, though.

803
01:13:49,119 --> 01:13:52,400
I mean, I stick to your answer rather than what I wrote here.

804
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:52,879
Yeah.

805
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,879
Can he use by this anyway?

806
01:13:55,119 --> 01:14:04,640
He is to be vague on his disciples because when Alyosha plagiarizes it, it's in response to the question, will you read out?

807
01:14:04,959 --> 01:14:05,280
I see.

808
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:10,560
You're saying Judas kisses Jesus and betrays him and so forth.

809
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:11,520
Woo.

810
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:16,399
I don't think that's on Dostoevsky's mind at this point.

811
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:25,199
It's somehow, I mean, there's been no talk of the actual Jesus and being betrayed and the disciple issues and all that.

812
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,119
But again, you may be right.

813
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:33,239
I mean, you have to read and look around, see if there's any hint that that's, but then, but then what would it mean?

814
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:40,680
That if that Jesus kisses the Grand Inquisitor, is that like Judas betraying Jesus?

815
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:46,600
Now, I see there's no place for me, even in your heart, my fear from the formula all involved.

816
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:48,919
I see.

817
01:14:48,999 --> 01:14:50,520
He says, in effect, no.

818
01:14:51,959 --> 01:14:52,600
I see.

819
01:14:52,759 --> 01:14:57,239
Alyasha kisses Yvonne, even though he thinks Yvonne is wrong.

820
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:58,919
I think that's important.

821
01:14:58,919 --> 01:15:06,919
And presumably he does it because he thinks that Yvonne is doing the best he can, struggling with the kind of self he's got.

822
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:09,560
And Alyasha is going to sort of support him.

823
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:11,719
Alyasha supports everybody.

824
01:15:11,719 --> 01:15:16,759
And even when they are going astray, he tries to help them with his love.

825
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:23,399
I think he's just saying, I love you, Yvonne, no matter, even if you're a practically lost soul.

826
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:23,879
Yeah.

827
01:15:23,879 --> 01:15:29,159
And it's the desire, especially Grand Inquisitor, and Jesus loves him back anyway.

828
01:15:29,159 --> 01:15:32,919
And Yvonne makes the point that he doesn't agree with Alyasha.

829
01:15:32,919 --> 01:15:38,039
He's, in fact, told this whole story to shoot down Alyasha's view that Jesus is the good person.

830
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:40,759
And Jesus, and he's saying, I love you anyway.

831
01:15:40,759 --> 01:15:41,400
That's good.

832
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:42,199
We can stop.

833
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:42,919
That's helpful.

834
01:15:42,919 --> 01:15:46,759
Of course, if anybody has a paper topic answer to this, that's also interesting.
