1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,880
So, we'll go back to a good question, which one of the TAs told me comes from his or her section.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:20,320
I don't remember who told me, but apparently it's bothering several people, and it might well, because they want to know what is Kierkegaard's unconditional commitment.

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:41,199
And it looks like, not that we need to know, I mean, that's, but as long as it's come up, we might as well talk about it for a minute, because it looks like it's Regina, if you read that, has this sort of cryptic code, a message to Regina, which he presents it as.

4
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:45,040
But clearly, it's not really Regina.

5
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:55,040
Something is standing in the way of his loving and marrying Regina, and because he has some other calling.

6
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:21,320
Remember, he said when he was, was it 21 or something like that, he has to find out the cause for which he would live or die, and it turns out to be, and I mentioned it, but it is, again, I say you could understand all that's important about Kierkegaard without knowing anything about his life, but it turns out to be that he thinks his job is to make Christianity extremely difficult.

7
00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:32,999
That the Lutheran church has made it so easy that all you have to do is be born in Denmark and you are a Christian, and that this is terrible because it stands in the way of people really becoming Christians.

8
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So his job is to show that it's very, very hard.

9
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,840
And that's his defining commitment.

10
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:47,560
And it looks like, in fact, it failed.

11
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:58,680
He did not succeed in convincing anybody in Denmark, as far as I know, that Christianity is sort of, that the Lutheran Church is the enemy of Christianity.

12
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,560
But that's all right.

13
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,959
His unconditional commitment might well be vulnerable.

14
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,839
They usually are.

15
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:12,279
And we'll hear next time about how your unconditional commitment can put you out of the ethical.

16
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:16,199
Next time, I mean, after Hiroshima, when we're reading problem one and two.

17
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:30,680
And this one did put him outside the ethical, since I don't think anybody could understand, and I don't think he could justify why he was spending all of his time and energy trying to destroy the church and at the same time claiming to be a Christian.

18
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,520
So anyway, all that is just background.

19
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:44,199
So now it looks like the situation for Kierkegaard is he had what he took to be, or should have been, or he felt should have been a defining commitment, but he felt that for some reason he couldn't go through with it.

20
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:52,360
He didn't know yet what his calling was, but there was something that was his calling that made it impossible for him to marry Regina.

21
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:59,880
And finally, he found his calling, namely writing this very strange anti-Christian, pro-Christian books.

22
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,560
Any question about that?

23
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,079
I don't want to dwell on it.

24
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:12,560
I mean, Heidegger, my favorite philosopher, once said in his Aristotle course, Aristotle was born and wrote and died, and that's all you need to know is background.

25
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,639
And I feel the same way about Kierkegaard.

26
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,320
It's mostly gossip that you find if you try to find the background.

27
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,479
So let's get to the night of fate.

28
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:31,599
And we've gone through all those movements of resignation in which one becomes a knight of resignation.

29
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:50,800
And to become a knight of resignation is the movement of the sort of most modern, most Christian kind of movement where you take this unconditional commitment and you turn it into the ideal of it.

30
00:03:51,279 --> 00:04:04,240
As I keep saying, it's like saying, loving a particular person is too risky, it makes me too vulnerable, but I can turn this love into the significance of the love.

31
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,280
But me, loving that particular person stays.

32
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:20,959
I get defined in terms of that particular person, but I don't have to take any risks because the meaning is eternal, the meaning is safe, it's infinite, not finite.

33
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:28,400
So you get something, namely that you get an identity out of it.

34
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,839
You become an individual, but you lack something.

35
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:43,760
There's nothing it tells you to do in the world of everyday existence in time and in the finite, as Kierkegaard would say.

36
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,680
And that's a big negative.

37
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:54,040
You can't really have a fulfilled relation to an ideal, a memory.

38
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:59,000
You've got to have a real person, then you have a risk.

39
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:08,039
And if you get a real person back, you wouldn't know what to do with them because if you can't stand the risk the first time around, you won't be able to stand the risk the second time around either.

40
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:15,720
So, okay, so let's look at page 73 as where Kierkegaard's explaining all this.

41
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:20,279
At the middle of 73, I read this already, but I just want to connect up.

42
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:24,519
So he keeps his love young and it grows with him in years.

43
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:27,959
On the other hand, he needs no final occasion for its growth.

44
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:31,079
For the moment he made the movement, the princess is lost.

45
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:35,880
That is, the princess, as a finite, embodied lover is lost.

46
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,639
All that's left of the princess is the ideal memory.

47
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,840
Same thing with Dante.

48
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:45,800
Beatrice says, when I died, you should have been happy about that because it really doesn't matter.

49
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,399
It's the ideal of our relationship that matters.

50
00:05:49,399 --> 00:06:01,239
He needs none of the erotic titillations of the nerves at the side of the beloved, nor does he need a finite, in a finite sense, to be taking his farewell, for his memory of her is an eternal one.

51
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,160
And because he's made that move, he's self-sufficient.

52
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:07,399
He's not vulnerable anymore, skipping a little.

53
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:13,960
He's grasped the deep secret that even in loving another, one should be sufficient unto oneself.

54
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,399
How do you do that?

55
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:18,279
Love another and not be vulnerable and be sufficient?

56
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:23,960
Simply love the meaning of the relationship and the memory of the relation.

57
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,360
I mean, I seem to be saying these things over and over.

58
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,480
That's partly because I try to prepare you for the movie.

59
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,480
But it's also central to the book.

60
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,679
Now, then comes the harder part.

61
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:43,120
There's a movement of resignation, which is different than becoming a knight of resignation.

62
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:48,880
And what, and we have to, and even the knight of faith makes the movement of resignation.

63
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,040
So we have to separate them out.

64
00:06:51,039 --> 00:07:00,639
And if you brought this with you, as I told you to, or want to get another one, which is lying there, anybody need a copy of this?

65
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,160
Okay.

66
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,240
Sorry, Dave.

67
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,360
Oh, it'll be a Christian.

68
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:05,680
Go ahead.

69
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:08,399
Dave's already helped me get organized.

70
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:13,440
So put your hands up if you need this, because I'm going to be talking about a chart on this page.

71
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:19,280
It's the same chart that I gave out last time, but some of you don't have it, I see.

72
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:24,880
Okay, so I'm talking about the chart at the top of the page with those various charts.

73
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,840
And I'll just run through where we are.

74
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:37,520
So where everybody starts at lower natures, which means having desires, infatuations, superstitions, and all that.

75
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:58,160
And they go through the ethical or the universal, and that is they mediate it, they get rid of their obsessions and superstitions and sort of childish belief that they have to have all the satisfactions that they instant gratification.

76
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,159
They get over all that.

77
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:05,120
And then they have an experience called the instant with a capital I.

78
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:12,240
And that's when they get a definite, after defining commitment that tells them who they are, makes them an individual.

79
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,000
And then comes the movement of resignation.

80
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:27,720
And now, the movement of resignation is this phrase I just read, in effect, that you can be sufficient unto yourself.

81
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:34,200
That is, you can make a movement in which you wait.

82
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:36,120
I'm not sure I'm going to say that.

83
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,720
No, I used to say that.

84
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,639
It's not the right way to put it.

85
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,240
Never mind that.

86
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,240
What is the movement then of resignation?

87
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,800
It's the realization that everything is a kind of gift.

88
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:56,200
You have no right to expect all your desires to be satisfied.

89
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:07,720
Nothing you can do, no works, as Luther would say, sort of guarantees that you're going to have a fulfilled life in this world.

90
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,040
And so you make, you understand that.

91
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:17,799
I mean, in the end, it turns out, just parenthetically, that in the world of the spirit, you'll always be all right.

92
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,000
We don't know what that means yet.

93
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,360
But you understand that in this world, everything is a gift.

94
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:25,880
You have no final control over it.

95
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:29,560
That's why I don't like the phrase sufficient unto yourself.

96
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:30,599
I was wrong about that.

97
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:44,039
The night of resignation, because they say, I've got this memory, I've got this perfect view of the significance of my love, and nothing bad can happen to that.

98
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,960
Nobody can take that away.

99
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:51,039
But the knight who is making only the movements of resignation.

100
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,639
It doesn't go that way of being self-sufficient.

101
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:01,880
It has another sense in which they are vulnerable because everything is a gift.

102
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,360
Everything could be taken away.

103
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:13,680
They have to accept that with a kind of suffering that goes with it, the realization that they're not going to be able to satisfy all their desires.

104
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:20,639
And that movement of resignation is, I think we should write it on the chart.

105
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:38,160
The chart still expresses my old version that you should write there after the movement of resignation can't count on satisfying their desires.

106
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,600
That's just one way of putting it, a million different ways of putting it.

107
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,520
The sense that everything's a gift for which, insofar as you get anything nice, you should feel gratitude for it.

108
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,880
You don't have, there's no reason why any good thing should be happening to you.

109
00:10:53,519 --> 00:11:06,959
So, and that means you're reconciled to vulnerability, because that means that you have no guarantee that you'll keep anything, and therefore you don't have any guarantee that you'll keep the person you love.

110
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,480
They won't leave or die either.

111
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:17,679
But now the question is, and the night of resignation you see on the chart goes up to that level on the left, and that's it.

112
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:20,399
It's a dead end for the night of resignation.

113
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,760
They've given up, they settle for comfort and sorrow.

114
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:33,120
The sorrow part is to give up having any guarantee of the enduring satisfaction of any of their desires.

115
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:42,800
And the comfort is that nothing more bad can happen to them because they've already accepted their total vulnerability.

116
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,880
But what about now comes the, we're ready to get to the night of faith.

117
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,799
Why is it that the night of faith has to go through the movements of resignation?

118
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:53,080
That's the first thing.

119
00:11:49,440 --> 00:12:11,560
Because what Kierkegaard says, I'll read it in a minute, that the night, sorry, the knight of faith, which you've now branched off here to the right, makes the movements, the renunciation of resignation, and he makes them all the time.

120
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:14,680
Even when he's a knight of faith, he's making them.

121
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:16,519
What does that mean?

122
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:17,800
Why is he saying that?

123
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:22,840
Why does the knight of faith have to go through the movements of resignation and be in them all the time?

124
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,000
Well, it's because that's how he gets out of lower immediacy.

125
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:38,600
That is, he shouldn't be sort of hooked on any of anything or believe that he has to satisfy any of his desires or her desires to have a meaningful life.

126
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,760
He has to give all that up.

127
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:44,120
On 73, he's talking about that.

128
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,760
Well, not exactly.

129
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,440
I find a better one.

130
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,960
On 74.

131
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,920
So it's about 10 lines from the bottom.

132
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:58,440
In infinite resignation, there is peace and repose and consolation in pain.

133
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,680
Now, that's where the night of resignation, the night of resignation, ends up.

134
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,799
But everybody's got to do it.

135
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:11,000
So if you read that whole paragraph, you find that out.

136
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,040
In infinite resignation, there is peace and repose.

137
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:18,120
Now, keep remembering, lo and behold, it's, I haven't understood this ever.

138
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,560
I'm trying each time, this time I'm doing a little better, I think.

139
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:37,679
But I'm trying to get used to the fact that the knight of faith, who is the, quote, joyful heir to the finite, we find out, has to go through and be in some kind of resignation and then go further.

140
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:40,320
So, in infinite resignation, there is peace and repose.

141
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:50,880
Anyone who wants it, who has not debased himself, can discipline himself to make this movement, which in its pain reconciles one with existence.

142
00:13:51,200 --> 00:14:00,960
And that's, it can be a kind of total protection against any kind of vulnerability.

143
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:09,280
But it also can be, and now look at the middle of 75, in infinite resignation, infinite resignation is the last stage before faith.

144
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,639
So, anyone who has not made this movement does not have faith.

145
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,360
For only in infinite resignation does my eternal validity become transparent to me.

146
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,880
Only then can there be grass talk of grasping existence on the strength of faith.

147
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,000
Well, what does that mean?

148
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,040
Well, I keep trying to say to myself and help and try to help you understand.

149
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:39,199
So, that's when you go through the, get over the childish expectation that you have to satisfy and you deserve to satisfy any of your desires.

150
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:54,319
That gets you out of lower immediacy, out of childishness, out of being like Tierkegaard talks about the young girl who thinks that she loves somebody and everything's going to be just great.

151
00:14:54,319 --> 00:14:57,039
There's no problem there.

152
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:04,799
But that would just be an aesthetic emotion.

153
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:10,399
I mean, feeling safe, feeling good, feeling, oh boy, I'm the kind of person that this is really going to work out.

154
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,480
And it just feels like it's going to work out.

155
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,159
And I bet I'm going to be, I'm so lucky, I'm going to be happy all my life.

156
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,399
All that is lower immediacy.

157
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,760
That's childishness or adolescence or something.

158
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:30,119
And you've got to get over that and realize that there is no guarantee that anything's going to work out.

159
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:39,480
And then you've gotten in the chart beyond to the point where you're at that big branch point.

160
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,599
And then you can go on through faith.

161
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:58,760
So now I have to explain how, but never, you never get any sense when you go on to faith that somehow it's guaranteed in a way that you can understand that everything is going to work out.

162
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:01,400
You continue to hold on to this.

163
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,360
This is the hard part.

164
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:13,399
You continue to hold on to the understanding that everything is a gift, everything is vulnerable, even your love and your defining commitment is a gift and is vulnerable.

165
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:22,359
You continue to hold on to that, but you don't get stuck in the comfort and sorrow that the night of resignation does.

166
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:25,319
Now we have to try to explain that more and more.

167
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:31,879
So first, I think I will try to explain one other thing I never understand, but hope that it will be.

168
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,959
I think we get this.

169
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:37,079
This is my version for this year.

170
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,760
That you get this explained to you in two steps.

171
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,960
Kierkegaard sees that it's very hard to understand it.

172
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,319
So first you get the story.

173
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:46,279
I have to find it.

174
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:47,559
I thought I had it marked.

175
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:48,519
I do have it here.

176
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:49,720
So let's find it.

177
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:59,319
The man who's going down the street thinking that he's going to have a great dinner and all he's going to really have is turtip soup, but that's all right, too.

178
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,039
Where is that?

179
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:01,799
Anybody got that?

180
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,319
Should be on maybe 78.

181
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:06,959
I've got to find it.

182
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,159
What are they?

183
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:11,760
59.

184
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,279
I'm going in the wrong direction.

185
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:14,240
Hmm?

186
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,680
69.

187
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,839
Okay, let's try that.

188
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:23,199
Yeah, okay, there.

189
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,760
That's it.

190
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,079
68 and 69.

191
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:43,439
Now, what I think is going on is he tells you, this guy's a knight of faith, he says, but he's not, what's funny when you read it is, you don't find anything about defining commitments or absurdity and paradoxes, which you're going to get when you get to the night of faith.

192
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,760
I think this is the part which the night of faith and the night of resignation share.

193
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,279
The guy, no?

194
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,439
No, no, that's not right either.

195
00:17:54,879 --> 00:17:55,519
Okay.

196
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:16,960
The knight of faith, even though he's making the movements of resignation, is enjoying everything finite because he's got not only the sense that it's all a gift, but the sense that no matter what happens, he will get what he really needs and everything will be all right.

197
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:28,240
And that's what this guy who's going down the street thinking about this dinner, and he takes pleasure in everything in the finite, we're told about 15 lines up.

198
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,840
And why?

199
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:32,720
And he delights, this top of 69 is fine.

200
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,440
Whoever gave me 68, he delights in everything he sees around him and so forth.

201
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,319
It turns out he doesn't get the dinner that he's expecting.

202
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,079
He only gets turned through, but that's all right.

203
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:49,519
He's the bottom of the page now comes this crucial thing.

204
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:59,960
Having, he's done all that, and he drains in infinite resignation, a deep sorrow of existence.

205
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,920
That's true.

206
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,839
He's got infinite resignation.

207
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,359
I think you ought to keep saying that to himself.

208
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:05,960
He's not a knight of resignation.

209
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,319
He didn't stop there.

210
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:09,080
He knows the bliss of infinity.

211
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,240
That's true.

212
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:16,760
He's felt the pain of renouncing everything, whatever is most precious in the world.

213
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,199
And he's done all that.

214
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,519
And yet to him, finitude tastes as good as to one who's never known anything higher.

215
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:26,760
For his remaining in the finite bore no trace of this anxious training.

216
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:34,199
And still he had the sense of being secure to take pleasure in it, that is, in the finite, as though it were the most certain thing of all.

217
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,680
And that's the interesting part.

218
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:50,199
He comes, even though he's making the movements of resignation and given up everything as a gift which he has no guarantee of, he's sure that he can enjoy everything.

219
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:56,119
And he's not going to miss out on all the goodies that finitude has.

220
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,399
Let's go on.

221
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:04,359
And still, he has this sense of being secure and taking pleasure in it as though it were the most certain thing of all.

222
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:17,399
So though he's given it all up in seeing that it's not secure at all, he lives it as if it's the most secure of all.

223
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:20,039
That's you looking all puzzled, and rightly so.

224
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:22,279
This is supposed to be paradoxical.

225
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:25,559
This is supposed to be something that the Knight of faith can do.

226
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:32,599
That the guy writing this, Diohannes de Salentio, can describe, he says, that he can't do it.

227
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:39,760
And I'm going to try to get you to see what it is that he's doing that is so puzzling.

228
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:40,960
But let's go on.

229
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,720
So he hesitates as if it were the most certain thing of all.

230
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:53,279
And yet, the whole earthly form of his form he presents is a new creation on the strength of the absurd.

231
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,960
He has resigned everything infinitely.

232
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,960
That's comfort and sorrow.

233
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,519
It sees that it's all vulnerable.

234
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:04,720
And then took everything back on the strength of the absurd.

235
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,359
He's continually making the movement of infinity.

236
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:09,359
That's infinite resignation.

237
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:15,359
But he makes it with such accuracy and poise that he's continuously getting finitude out of it.

238
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:20,159
And not a second would anybody suspect anything else.

239
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,600
Now, I'm going to have to say two things now.

240
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:25,919
This 70 is a very important page.

241
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:42,160
To begin with, at the middle of the page, Kierkegaard contrasts this person, Knight of Faith, who, in his movements of resignation, with the Knights of Infinity.

242
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,240
Those are the Knights of Resignation.

243
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,879
Those are the people who are stuck in resignation.

244
00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:49,440
The Knights of Infinity are dancers too.

245
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,560
They have elevation.

246
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,159
They make upward movement.

247
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,000
But they are strangers, I'm skipping a little, in the world.

248
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:06,160
They are strangers in the world in the sense that the only way they can understand being safe is by not committing themselves to anything.

249
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:15,199
They have defenses against ever being vulnerable because they've seen with sorrow that you could lose anything.

250
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,760
That's the Knights of Resignation.

251
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,760
But now, the Knight of Faith goes on and does something else.

252
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:37,720
And I think now, this is my belief for this year, that what Kierkegaard is doing there is saying that up to what I've been saying so far, you can't tell what's really going on.

253
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:59,159
It looks like somebody has just sort of renounced everything and is like, in another place, Kierkegaard talks of them of these people who have renounced everything as not having to be anxious because they can't lose anything and being relaxed and open like the birds of the air and the lilies of the field talking title talk.

254
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,199
And it looks like that's what he's been talking about.

255
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,679
But he's told you, no, he's talking about knights of faith.

256
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,039
So what happens?

257
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:13,640
Well, at the bottom of the page, he tells you he hasn't really explained it yet.

258
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,119
That's why I'm having such trouble explaining it.

259
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:26,760
He's only told you about this guy who's going down the street and who's enjoying everything and who somehow, we know, renounced everything.

260
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,440
That finally he tells you it.

261
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,039
Yet this Marvel can so easily deceive.

262
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:40,839
I will describe the movements in a particular case which can illustrate the respective relationships to reality, for these are what everything turns on.

263
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:44,680
And then he gives you the defining commitment story.

264
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,880
That it isn't as if the guy walking down the street doesn't have a defining commitment.

265
00:23:49,879 --> 00:23:51,240
He presumably does.

266
00:23:51,240 --> 00:24:01,159
But Kierkegaard sort of introduces you to him only in the sense that he has sort of renounced everything and still enjoys everything.

267
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,119
But then he says that's not really the extreme case.

268
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:14,399
The extreme case is where you have an unconditional commitment and you've renounced everything and yet you know that it's vulnerable.

269
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,439
And in effect, you've given it up because it's vulnerable and a gift.

270
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,359
And you know you'll always have it.

271
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:27,679
But that's now he says that's what he's going to deceive lots of people.

272
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,079
Since the Marvel can easily deceive.

273
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:34,079
I mean, Alistair McIntyre, the translator of this, is one of the people deceived.

274
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:40,879
He thinks it's something like the birds of the field or Buddhism or something that Kierkegaard is proposing.

275
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:46,319
Because you can't tell with this guy walking down the street, whether he's a Zen Buddhist or what he is.

276
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:57,200
But if you pay attention, when Kierkegaard introduces it, so to speak, the second half, then it's the young lad who falls in love with the princess.

277
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:02,480
And now comes the really interesting kind of knight of faith.

278
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:19,439
A knight of faith who has renounced everything and yet and seen the vulnerability of the unconditional commitment and yet he enjoys it as if there was no risk at all.

279
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,199
And that's the extreme version of what we're trying to talk about.

280
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,679
And that's, I'm going to read you a quote later, but it's my favorite quote.

281
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,199
I keep coming back to it.

282
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:35,679
That he sees the sword hanging over the head of the beloved and loves her as if it's the surest thing of all.

283
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:52,760
What he finally is interested in is what it is to have an unconditional commitment, which gives you an identity, which you see is vulnerable, but you don't have defenses against the vulnerability.

284
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:55,000
You let yourself get more and more involved.

285
00:25:55,879 --> 00:25:57,480
That's the paradox.

286
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,399
That's what is so strange.

287
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:09,000
You see that it's utterly uncertain and in a certain sense impossible because it can't possibly give you the guarantee that you need it.

288
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,079
You're going to build your whole life on it.

289
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:13,879
And then you build your whole life on it anyway.

290
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:17,000
That's what the Knight of Faith does.

291
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:21,960
And I'm still going to have to explain a lot, but I mean, I'm trying to give you the overall feeling.

292
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:43,559
So by the bottom of the page, you've left Alistair Hanny behind, and all the people who think that they understand this, they haven't understood it yet, because he's got to explain now the really strange thing that the Knight of Faith could do, that the Knight of Resignation can't do at all.

293
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,000
So I'm going to skip to 74.

294
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,279
All this stuff is very condensed, and it's all within a few pages.

295
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:54,839
So I don't know, I've sort of jumped ahead.

296
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:56,119
I've already said that.

297
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:57,719
So I'm not going to say it again.

298
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,639
So let's go to 78.

299
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:04,039
Okay, here's where you see what happens as clear as anywhere.

300
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,959
The middle of 75, to start.

301
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,760
That's better.

302
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,519
Infinite resignation.

303
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:11,959
Keep remembering, that's not the night of faith.

304
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:16,599
It's going to turn out to be the night of resignation he's talking to you about.

305
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:19,000
No, infinite resignation is the one they all have to go through.

306
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,720
Okay, infinite resignation is the last stage before faith.

307
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,439
You can see it in the Y-shaped chart.

308
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:29,000
For only in infinite resignation does my eternal validity become transparent.

309
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,519
That means that I have the capacity to give up everything.

310
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:42,480
But now, now comes, let us now have the knight of faith make his appearance in the case discussed.

311
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,199
He does exactly the same as the other knight.

312
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,600
He infinitely renounces the claim to the love, which is the content of his life.

313
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:54,799
You see, we've gone beyond the guy worrying about lamb stew or turnip soup.

314
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:05,519
We've now focused on the special feature of the knight of faith that he has gone through infinite resignation.

315
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:12,639
He understands that he has no claim, no guarantee about the loved person.

316
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,480
He renounces the claim to the love, which is the content of his life.

317
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,639
He's reconciled in pain.

318
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,080
But then comes the marvel.

319
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:23,839
I keep skirting around this trying to explain to you the marvel, the marvel.

320
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:37,199
He makes one more movement more wonderful than anything else, for he says, I nevertheless believe that I shall get her, namely on the strength of the absurd, on the strength of the fact that for God all things are possible.

321
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,559
And that is the night of faith.

322
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,319
That's his move.

323
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:50,399
We have to understand what it is, not just sort of fancy words, but get the phenomenon for what he's talking about here.

324
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,159
I'm going to see where I have to go to.

325
00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:01,599
Here's one more way to put it on page 78, the bottom of that big paragraph.

326
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:05,199
Now remember this time that Johannes de Salentio is talking.

327
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,680
This book is written by a knight of resignation.

328
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,519
You've got to keep remembering that.

329
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,839
Otherwise, you certainly get lost.

330
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,799
So he says, by my own strength, that's the night of resignation.

331
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:23,639
I cannot get the least thing of what belongs to finitude, for I'm continually using all my energy to renounce everything.

332
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:30,119
That means I'm putting all, just keep putting the phenomenon, you put all your energy in your defenses.

333
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:32,439
You make it perfectly safe.

334
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:48,199
You work at being invulnerable by being self-sufficient, by getting what enjoyment you get out of whatever happens to come around and not hanging on to this relationship.

335
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,000
So this is the night of resignation talking.

336
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,559
By my own strength, I can't get the least thing that belongs to finitude, for I'm continually using my energy to renounce everything.

337
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:00,519
That is using my energy in my defenses.

338
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:08,679
But by my own strength, I can give up the princess, and I'll be no sulker, but find joy and peace and repose in my pain.

339
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,960
But with my own strength, I cannot get her back again.

340
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,960
For all that strength is precisely what I use to renounce my claim to her.

341
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:25,960
I mean, all my defenses against my vulnerability is what I learned to do so well, that I can't get this real person back.

342
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:35,240
But by faith, but by faith, says that marvelous knight, by faith you will get her on the strength of the absurd.

343
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,719
And now, what does that mean?

344
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:46,359
Well, 79, now we get to my favorite line about what you get, though I haven't really explained very well yet how you get it.

345
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:48,679
About six lines down in 79.

346
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,319
And yet it must be wonderful to get the princess.

347
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:54,439
And yet it is only the knight of faith who is happy.

348
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,079
Only he is heir apparent to the finite.

349
00:30:57,079 --> 00:31:05,599
See, there is a certain kind of joy and peace, but always tied up with sorrow, comfort in sorrow, for the knight of resignation.

350
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:09,519
You'll be able to see that best when you see the movie.

351
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:11,760
And yet it must be wonderful to get the princess.

352
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,399
Only the knight of faith who is happy.

353
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,960
Only he is heir apparent to the finite.

354
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,559
Whereas the knight of resignation is a stranger and a foreigner.

355
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:27,680
To get the princess in this way, to live in bliss, I take joy is a lower thing.

356
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:32,000
Joy is what you get if you do your resignation knighthood right.

357
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,839
Bliss is what you get if you do your knight of faith right.

358
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:42,319
To live in bliss and happiness in her company day in and day out.

359
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:50,000
We have to allow, of course, that the knight of resignation too may get the princess, even though he has clearly perceived the impossibility of their future happiness.

360
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:51,840
Remember, what does that refer to?

361
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:55,040
What happens when the knight of resignation gets the princess?

362
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,600
Somebody tell me, so I could be, what?

363
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,679
No, no, he loves her.

364
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,760
That's not the problem.

365
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:03,279
What?

366
00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:05,519
He can't stay with her.

367
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,319
Is that what you said?

368
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:07,439
There's no place for her.

369
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:09,680
Somebody wanted to say something about that?

370
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,799
Yeah, the same thing.

371
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:40,960
Yeah, remember, if he gets the princess back, if you get the loved one back, bodily right there in the same room with you, and if either you've already decided it's only the meaning of the relationship that matters, in which case they're just sort of botheringly in the room with you, or you get sucked back into thinking that really their bodily presence is so important that you can't live without it, in which case you're back in the vulnerability that you've used all your energy for defenses.

372
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:45,200
So the Knight of Resignation can't get the Princess back.

373
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,960
But now let's go on.

374
00:32:48,479 --> 00:32:56,039
Then we've been allowed that the Knight of resignation may get the princess, even though he doesn't understand, can't have their future happiness together.

375
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:57,479
But now the knight of faith.

376
00:32:57,479 --> 00:33:14,440
Thus to live joyfully and happily in this way, every moment on the strength of the absurd, every moment to see the sword hanging over the loved one's head, and yet find not repose in the pain of resignation, but joy, and I think probably it should be bliss.

377
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:18,680
I think it's the same Danish word for both, but it helps that we have two words.

378
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,360
That bliss on the strength of the absurd, that is wonderful.

379
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:25,319
The one who does that, he is the only great one.

380
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:29,400
The thought of it stirs my soul, and so forth.

381
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:45,160
Okay, now, I don't know if I convinced you yet of what it's like, but it's having a sense that no matter what happens, let me think before I talk.

382
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:55,400
Having a sense of the vulnerability and nonetheless getting more and more involved as if it was the safest thing of all.

383
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,999
Now, the interesting thing is, anybody can do that.

384
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:04,279
The question is: why isn't that just foolish?

385
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:07,960
I mean, is there any good, that's crazy.

386
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:27,000
Build your whole life on a relationship the way Kierkegaard set it up in his Romantic Knights and Ladies tradition, and then know full well that it's vulnerable, and yet, get more and more involved, build more and more of your life, and let it twine about more and more of the ligaments of your consciousness.

387
00:34:26,999 --> 00:34:30,360
Why would anybody in their right mind do that?

388
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:34,040
Well, the answer is sort of in your right mind, you wouldn't do that.

389
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:44,000
That these people have, in effect, lost their mind, that not in some lower immediacy where they think that like some child that everything will be all right.

390
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:49,040
They think that they don't even think it, because thinking it, you wouldn't do it.

391
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:56,720
They sense that even though it's vulnerable, it's absolutely sure that they won't lose it.

392
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:10,479
And that's because, as Kierkegaard puts it, for God all things are possible, or which that isn't much help, or because they believe the absurd can happen, that helps a little.

393
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:20,240
What they really believe is that, and this is what faith is: faith is the sense that even the impossible is possible.

394
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,760
And they've got faith.

395
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,279
Faith doesn't mean they believe there's a God up in heaven.

396
00:35:25,279 --> 00:35:29,120
It doesn't mean that they believe in an afterlife they'll get the other person back.

397
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:33,760
Faith means that they actually live a contradiction.

398
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,760
That this relationship is vulnerable and that they'll always have it.

399
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:52,400
And the interesting thing about it, if you're following it is sort of, having that kind of faith gives you a kind of bliss and fulfillment that you can't have if you're always using your energy in your defenses.

400
00:35:52,399 --> 00:35:55,680
Of course, it leaves you the puzzle, which I haven't answered yet.

401
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,520
Yeah, but what if they do die?

402
00:35:57,999 --> 00:35:59,999
What if Abraham does kill Isaac?

403
00:35:59,999 --> 00:36:02,880
What if your defining relation crashes?

404
00:36:02,879 --> 00:36:10,799
I mean, the idea that you got deeper and deeper into it, and because you had faith that even the impossible was possible, doesn't seem much of a comfort.

405
00:36:10,799 --> 00:36:14,799
The whole point was to avoid that kind of disaster.

406
00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:17,760
And we haven't really figured out what that means yet.

407
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,079
Yeah.

408
00:36:22,279 --> 00:36:26,919
That's right, except try to be careful because it helps with the understanding.

409
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:30,760
Don't say no, that's too much like think and believe.

410
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:32,119
All those are the wrong words.

411
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:34,840
I fix you sense or you feel.

412
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:36,200
Is that all right?

413
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,239
Yeah.

414
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:38,599
Yes.

415
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,359
It's worth this.

416
00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:47,240
It's worth this.

417
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:51,160
That's mean.

418
00:36:51,799 --> 00:36:53,000
That's neither.

419
00:36:52,999 --> 00:37:08,360
Because I mean, Tierkegaard wants to set it up so that it's not worth it if your life, the meaning of your life will crash and your whole world will be lost in a kind of zombie-like state for the rest of your life if it fails somehow.

420
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,040
It's not enough.

421
00:37:10,279 --> 00:37:11,319
It's good that you say that.

422
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:16,440
It's not enough to think this is so great that it's worth the risk and I'll do it even if it crashes.

423
00:37:16,919 --> 00:37:22,120
He says that Abraham knows that he'll always have Isaac.

424
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,039
Or, and this is a tricky part.

425
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,960
I'll get to that in a little while.

426
00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:28,440
Or God will give him a new Isaac.

427
00:37:28,439 --> 00:37:33,479
Now that's that way, that's the gizmo which we'll get to.

428
00:37:33,479 --> 00:37:42,680
But I mean, the interesting thing is, the night of faith senses something which is really sort of contradictory.

429
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,240
This is the one and only love for me.

430
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,080
It defines who I am.

431
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:51,799
It's eternal forever in temporality.

432
00:37:51,799 --> 00:37:55,000
And if something goes wrong with it, I'll get a new one.

433
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:00,679
That's completely crazy, paradoxical attitude.

434
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:06,080
That it's not the attitude it's worth it, even if it, even though I go into grief afterwards.

435
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:14,159
It's a belief that in the world of the spirit, somehow it's got to work out.

436
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:20,240
But what it would mean to get a new IC, Kierkegaard really doesn't understand very well.

437
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,879
And he doesn't have to, since he's writing it from the point of view of Johannes de Salentio.

438
00:38:26,879 --> 00:38:32,560
But I don't think there's any place Kierkegaard wrote something to show that he understood it very well.

439
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,559
So I'm going to have to understand it for you.

440
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,799
But in a minute, not quite yet.

441
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:51,760
But all we've got so far is the Knight of Faith is living a very, very incomprehensible, and hear Kierkegaard words, paradoxical, way of life.

442
00:38:52,399 --> 00:39:07,440
He's living as if he's sure that he'll always have a defining commitment, and he knows perfectly well, seeing the sword over the head of the beloved, that he might lose the person who is the object of his defining commitment at any moment.

443
00:39:07,439 --> 00:39:23,520
And he has this sense that no matter what, it's all going to be all right, so I can get more and more involved, more and more vulnerable, have no defenses, let this thing become totally the center of me and my world.

444
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:29,040
And still, I see that it's vulnerable, and I see that somehow it's all going to be all right.

445
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:34,799
And that's the amazingly weird thing.

446
00:39:34,799 --> 00:39:37,920
And we haven't, I mean, I haven't explained it very well yet.

447
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:56,199
But it's not that, for instance, I just want to get one thing off off the table, so to speak, that it's that he senses, or she senses, as she gets more and more, he gets more and more involved in it, that, well, it's highly improbable that it's going to fail.

448
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:08,919
I want to just get that out of the way because it's sort of that's the difference between the sort of paradoxicalness and a kind of semi-rationalization of it.

449
00:40:08,919 --> 00:40:10,360
Where is that?

450
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:15,560
There are all these things I want to talk about at once.

451
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,240
I've lost it.

452
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,240
If anybody, he says it's not the improbable.

453
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,039
Good.

454
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,680
Okay.

455
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,719
75.

456
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,840
Yeah, good.

457
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:26,920
Now let's see.

458
00:40:26,919 --> 00:40:29,239
So now we let the, I'm going to read some more.

459
00:40:31,399 --> 00:40:35,959
Let us now have the Knight of Faith make his appearance in the case discussed.

460
00:40:35,959 --> 00:40:38,760
I'm in the second full paragraph.

461
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,119
He does exactly the same as the other knight.

462
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:46,120
He infinitely renounces the claim to the love which is the content of his life.

463
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:49,479
He's reconciled in pain, but then comes the marvel.

464
00:40:49,479 --> 00:41:02,200
He makes one more movement more wonderful than anything else, for he says, I nevertheless believe that I shall get her and, of course, keep her on the strength of the absurd, on the strength of the fact that for God all things are possible.

465
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:11,240
And then I just think it's important to realize you can't get out of this by saying, well, that just means that I think that it's very improbable that I will lose this person.

466
00:41:11,479 --> 00:41:16,200
He says the absurd is not one distinction among others embraced by the understanding.

467
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,760
See, that would be, that's something you could think.

468
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,679
Well, it's pretty secure.

469
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,440
Maybe it's very secure.

470
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:23,639
I'm young.

471
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,040
She's young, and we're all very healthy.

472
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,799
We all live to be very old, you know, our parents live to be very old.

473
00:41:29,799 --> 00:41:30,999
So what are we worrying about?

474
00:41:30,999 --> 00:41:32,120
It's not like that.

475
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:39,200
The absurd is not a distinction among others embraced by the understanding, it's not the improbable, the unexpected, or the unforeseen.

476
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:45,760
The moment the knight resigned, he was convinced of the impossibility, humanly speaking.

477
00:41:45,999 --> 00:41:50,480
That is, again, the impossibility of it being secure.

478
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:54,880
That was the conclusion of the understanding, and he had enough energy to think it.

479
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:05,120
Only in the finite world at the bottom, it's only in the finite world that understanding rules, and there it was, it remains an impossibility.

480
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:09,920
But the impossibility is more than just the improbable.

481
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,559
It's what could be impossible.

482
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,279
Well, it couldn't be impossible for the lad to get the princess.

483
00:42:15,279 --> 00:42:19,919
Maybe he turns out to the lad to be a fondling and really a prince himself or something.

484
00:42:19,919 --> 00:42:21,520
It's very improbable.

485
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:40,720
But what's impossible, you have to keep saying to yourself, is the kind of guarantee that you need if you were going to get yourself defenselessly involved in this defining commitment such that your personality, your individuality, your world, and your life would be destroyed if it failed.

486
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,159
That's the impossible.

487
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,000
You can't have the security.

488
00:42:43,999 --> 00:42:45,039
Okay, good.

489
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,680
Let's say something.

490
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,479
I'm talking too much.

491
00:42:53,919 --> 00:42:54,720
Where is that?

492
00:42:55,279 --> 00:42:56,399
Well, I've got to read it now.

493
00:42:56,399 --> 00:42:56,799
I see.

494
00:42:56,799 --> 00:42:57,279
Okay.

495
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:58,479
I'm going to agree.

496
00:42:58,479 --> 00:43:08,799
In an infinite sense, however, it was possible through renouncing it as a finite possibility, but then accepting that possibility is at the same time to have given it up.

497
00:43:08,799 --> 00:43:19,119
Yet for the understanding, there is no absurdity in possessing it, for it is only in the finite world that understanding rules, and there it was and remains an impossibility.

498
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,439
Whoa, no wonder I skipped it.

499
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,240
I don't understand it.

500
00:43:30,439 --> 00:43:32,279
You smuggle in the baby there.

501
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:33,479
That won't do at all.

502
00:43:33,479 --> 00:43:36,279
It would just oh, you don't understand it now, and I don't understand it.

503
00:43:36,279 --> 00:43:37,879
So let's read it again.

504
00:43:37,879 --> 00:43:39,080
It's a challenge.

505
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,200
I'm going to try again.

506
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:47,799
The moment the knight resigned, he was convinced of the impossibility, humanly speaking.

507
00:43:47,799 --> 00:43:51,480
That was the conclusion of the understanding, and he had the energy to think it.

508
00:43:51,479 --> 00:44:03,319
Okay, so both the knight of faith and the knight of faith know that the kind of guarantee that you would need to get involved like that is something you can't have in the finite world.

509
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:10,680
In an infinite sense, however, it was possible through renouncing it as a finite possibility.

510
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,039
I wonder, I'm worried.

511
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:24,519
I may end up having to just go back and try to unravel the Danish because when Panny goes in and starts telling me in brackets what the antecedents of the pronouns are, he may be mixing us up.

512
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,959
But let's try to understand it.

513
00:44:25,959 --> 00:44:29,799
And then if I can't, I'll go back and see if it's the fault of the translation.

514
00:44:29,799 --> 00:44:30,439
Let's try.

515
00:44:30,439 --> 00:44:37,720
In an infinite sense, however, it was possible through announcing it as a finite possibility.

516
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:44,920
But then accepting that possibility is at the same time to have given it up.

517
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:50,120
And yet for the understanding, there is no absurdity in possessing it.

518
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:58,120
For it is only in the finite world that understanding rules, and there it was and remains an impossibility.

519
00:44:58,999 --> 00:45:00,439
Anybody understand that?

520
00:45:01,399 --> 00:45:02,519
Yeah, Beatrice.

521
00:45:04,879 --> 00:45:13,920
Well, and I'm looking away because I have a feeling that we have to go on reading it, because I'm not sure that he's talking about just the night of faith.

522
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:21,119
It looks like that, I understand that sentence to be about the night of infinite resignation.

523
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,319
Is there any reason to understand it that way?

524
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:25,360
Let me look back.

525
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:31,120
The moment the knight resigned, he was convinced of the impossibility, humanly speaking, of the conclusion of the understanding.

526
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:37,279
So the knight of resignation, let's get that clear, is convinced of the impossibility.

527
00:45:37,279 --> 00:45:46,000
And he thinks it, and he makes his move, namely, idealize it, eternalize it, take it out of the finite.

528
00:45:45,999 --> 00:45:47,279
Now let's see what happens.

529
00:45:47,279 --> 00:45:55,119
In an infinite sense, however, it was possible through renunciation, renouncing it as a finite possibility.

530
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,760
I think this is still a night of resignation.

531
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,960
But then accepting that possibility is at the same time to have given it up.

532
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:12,880
I think that means just resign yourself to not having the security that you need.

533
00:46:12,879 --> 00:46:18,479
For it is only in the finite world that understanding rules, and there it was and remains an impossibility.

534
00:46:18,479 --> 00:46:22,240
That is, in the finite world, you can't get this kind of guarantee.

535
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,719
On this, the night of faith is just as clear.

536
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,760
See, that was the night of resignation, that sentence.

537
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,879
And it may be that it's got because of the pronouns sort of messed up.

538
00:46:32,879 --> 00:46:35,520
They're renouncing it as a finite possibility.

539
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,119
I think, well, let's leave it at that.

540
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,399
It is the night of resignation.

541
00:46:38,399 --> 00:46:41,120
On this, the night of faith is just as clear.

542
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,680
All that can save him is the absurd.

543
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,359
Okay, they're both convinced.

544
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:54,840
I'm beginning to understand it, that in the finite world, it's impossible to have the security you would need to have this kind of unconditional commitment.

545
00:46:55,160 --> 00:47:00,040
And so he's got to get it there, get it by the absurd.

546
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,879
And this he grasps by faith.

547
00:47:01,879 --> 00:47:07,079
Accordingly, he admits the impossibility and at the same time believes the absurd.

548
00:47:07,959 --> 00:47:16,599
He admits the impossibility of having a secure relationship, and he accepts that he's always going to be able to have a secure relationship.

549
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,799
He has no defenses.

550
00:47:17,799 --> 00:47:19,400
He's totally involved.

551
00:47:19,399 --> 00:47:22,760
He sees the sword hanging over the head of the beloved.

552
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,679
That's the impossibility.

553
00:47:24,999 --> 00:47:28,999
That is, it's vulnerability, which is the same as impossibility.

554
00:47:28,999 --> 00:47:29,639
You got that.

555
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:34,279
I mean, it's impossible because it's vulnerable in the everyday world.

556
00:47:34,279 --> 00:47:41,319
He sees that, and then the absurd part gets more and more and more involved, just as if it was absolutely safe.

557
00:47:41,319 --> 00:47:41,799
Yeah.

558
00:47:43,959 --> 00:47:46,919
Well, sort of, except it's even a little weirder.

559
00:47:46,919 --> 00:47:48,680
The understanding plays a role.

560
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,919
He's got an understanding just like everybody else.

561
00:47:50,919 --> 00:47:52,519
That's what that weird sentence says.

562
00:47:52,520 --> 00:48:00,760
He understands that if you're sensible, you can see that the sword could fall at any moment, that the finite world is totally vulnerable.

563
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:06,200
He understands and he sees that you could renounce everything and then you'd be safe.

564
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:11,719
And having seen all that, he then has does something.

565
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,720
It isn't a question of thinking.

566
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:18,440
He gets involved in the relation as if it were the safest thing of all.

567
00:48:18,439 --> 00:48:37,440
Meaning, instead of using all of his emotional energy in defenses of making sure that it stays beautiful and eternal, he uses all his emotional energy just to get more and more committed and more and more risk that if everything went wrong, it would be really, really wrong.

568
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:39,680
That's how it is with them.

569
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,760
That's what it is to be in this absurd relationship.

570
00:48:43,919 --> 00:48:50,720
But if you don't keep your eye on the phenomena, it just seems completely insane word juggling.

571
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,959
So let me repeat the phenomenon.

572
00:48:52,959 --> 00:48:55,360
You may have known somebody like this.

573
00:48:55,359 --> 00:49:21,200
I knew one person at least who was like this, who was absolutely defenseless, who was able to be completely vulnerable, who was aware that she was risking her happiness in getting involved that way, but who had faith, was convinced that somehow everything would be all right.

574
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,279
And it turned out all right.

575
00:49:23,279 --> 00:49:26,720
She lost her defining commitment and she got another one.

576
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,879
But that's the next thing I haven't told you yet.

577
00:49:28,879 --> 00:49:33,679
I mean, that's how to live this absurdity.

578
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:46,480
So far, I've just said the happiest people are the people who have faith, who see the vulnerability, and don't let it keep them from getting involved and don't use their energy in their defenses.

579
00:49:46,479 --> 00:49:53,680
But now, and we're told yes, but those people are totally incomprehensible because nobody in their right mind would do that sort of thing.

580
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,559
And that's right.

581
00:49:54,560 --> 00:50:02,080
That's what Kierkegaard means when he says the knight of faith lives in a paradoxical and even absurd way.

582
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:11,360
They stake everything, they stake their life on something absolute that they see is not reliable, not guaranteed.

583
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:13,920
And that's now.

584
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:17,680
I'll go back to this because I want to make sure we get they get there.

585
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:27,640
I'm not going to leave you without some understanding of what's going on here, even if Kierkegaard or DeSalantio doesn't have it, because you need it to see the movie right.

586
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,240
Okay, now let's see.

587
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,680
He, I'm just reading my notes.

588
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:35,559
So he accepts the impossibility, but he goes on as if it was totally safe.

589
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:38,279
We've said that, I think, but I just want to make sure.

590
00:50:40,439 --> 00:50:42,200
Yeah, that's the Marvel.

591
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:42,679
Okay.

592
00:50:42,999 --> 00:50:50,600
And how does, and you don't get stuck in resignation.

593
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,839
You make the two movements simultaneously.

594
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:56,120
It's a bit late to say that, but let's see if I need to say that.

595
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,399
On 70.

596
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,439
Yeah, that's being a new creation.

597
00:51:00,439 --> 00:51:01,720
That's all right.

598
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:08,519
The Knight of Resignation doesn't want to base his life on something so insecure.

599
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,119
Let's see if I've said that.

600
00:51:10,439 --> 00:51:11,159
Yeah.

601
00:51:11,479 --> 00:51:14,999
And now, yeah.

602
00:51:15,319 --> 00:51:15,799
Okay.

603
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,479
Now, I've got to catch up.

604
00:51:17,799 --> 00:51:21,559
I got carried away into trying to say the phenomena.

605
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,960
I have to show you the pages.

606
00:51:24,919 --> 00:51:28,519
So let's go remember because it's going to be important too for the movie.

607
00:51:28,839 --> 00:51:31,560
What's happening meanwhile with the Knight of Resignation?

608
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,600
The Knight of Resignation has done something terrific.

609
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:46,920
They are able to do this idealizing, become self-sufficient, and they just glide along in the real world because nothing can really hurt them.

610
00:51:46,919 --> 00:52:00,120
They have peace and repose, and they, because they made the movement of infinite resignation, their Knights of Resignation, I just want to phrase, because I think there's somebody in the movie who illustrates this.

611
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:07,279
On 67, he's talking about how they glide along at the bottom of 67.

612
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:10,720
The knights of infinite resignation are readily recognizable.

613
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:13,760
Their gait is gliding and bold.

614
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:19,279
That is, they're so, they are really secure.

615
00:52:19,279 --> 00:52:22,319
And not in an absurd way.

616
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,519
They've made a very sensible move.

617
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:35,200
They've sacrificed their finite, temporal, embodied relationship to the one they love for total security.

618
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,479
So they can drift along.

619
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:42,319
Nothing can take away the significance of the relationship, the eternal meaning of the relationship.

620
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:43,680
That's important.

621
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,880
When you see the movie, figure out who that is.

622
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:54,560
And I didn't read, I think, the passage where they are using all their energy in their defenses.

623
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,799
Did I read this on page 78?

624
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:57,920
I don't think so.

625
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,600
Did I read the bottom part of the middle paragraph on 78?

626
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,919
Does any of you know who marked things up?

627
00:53:03,919 --> 00:53:04,399
I don't think so.

628
00:53:04,399 --> 00:53:05,840
So let's read it.

629
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,399
I'm starting about 15 lines from the bottom of the middle paragraph.

630
00:53:10,399 --> 00:53:14,960
But by my own strength, I cannot get the least thing of what belongs to Finitude.

631
00:53:14,959 --> 00:53:17,279
Remember who's talking?

632
00:53:17,279 --> 00:53:18,960
Just a reminder.

633
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,039
DeSilentio.

634
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,240
And what is he?

635
00:53:22,879 --> 00:53:23,680
Okay, okay.

636
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:31,360
Now, by my own strength, I can't get the least thing of what belongs to Finitude, for I'm continually using my energy to renounce everything.

637
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:35,120
But by my own strength, I can give up the princess, and I shall be no sulker.

638
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:38,080
I'll find joy and peace and repose in pain.

639
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:45,040
But with my own strength, I can't get her back again, for all that strength is precisely what I used to renounce my claim on her.

640
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:50,839
That by faith, says the marvelous knight, by faith you will get her on the strength of the absurd.

641
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:57,400
Okay, that sums up a lot of what I did read and say, that it's a good quote.

642
00:53:57,399 --> 00:54:07,720
Okay, and now all this is turning out to be the paradox of existence, which I had plenty of time explaining, but now let's see if we need some quotes.

643
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,919
No, I don't need that one.

644
00:54:08,919 --> 00:54:10,200
I did it already.

645
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,799
Let's look at this one.

646
00:54:11,799 --> 00:54:13,720
Yeah, I did that one.

647
00:54:14,359 --> 00:54:17,960
So he's believing, and believe is the wrong word.

648
00:54:17,959 --> 00:54:23,319
If I say in my notes, does he believe both that it's impossible and the surest thing of all?

649
00:54:23,319 --> 00:54:24,600
Does he?

650
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,400
No, not believe it.

651
00:54:27,399 --> 00:54:28,760
He lives it.

652
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:33,319
And that's why it's a paradox not of the mind, but the paradox of existence.

653
00:54:33,319 --> 00:54:41,560
He exists in a way which is paradoxical by getting more and more involved and knowing it's vulnerable.

654
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:46,279
And seeing the vulnerability and acting as if it's the surest thing of all.

655
00:54:46,279 --> 00:54:48,439
That's not like believing, but that's faith.

656
00:54:48,439 --> 00:54:49,720
Faith isn't believing.

657
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:54,680
It's acting in a world in which even the impossible is possible.

658
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,400
So I said that already.

659
00:54:58,359 --> 00:54:59,799
You can't understand it.

660
00:54:59,799 --> 00:55:01,480
You can only do it.

661
00:55:01,479 --> 00:55:03,799
That's sum up what I've been saying.

662
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:05,720
And people do do it.

663
00:55:05,959 --> 00:55:09,799
I say I know somebody who did it, and I'm sure you do too, or may well.

664
00:55:09,799 --> 00:55:13,319
And that's the paradox of existence.

665
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,000
Let's see.

666
00:55:15,319 --> 00:55:30,360
Yeah, I mean, the phrase the paradox of existence, which means doing something impossible, even though you can't think it, is on page 76, the third line of the first full paragraph.

667
00:55:30,359 --> 00:55:35,040
It's not the immediate inclination of the heart, but the paradox of existence.

668
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,999
And the reason you know, it's not the immediate inclination of the heart.

669
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:38,720
Why is that?

670
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,760
How do you know that?

671
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,480
For sure, when you see this guy?

672
00:55:43,439 --> 00:55:45,840
Because he's made the movements of resignation.

673
00:55:45,999 --> 00:55:52,799
He's not there in the lower immediacy of the immediate inclination of the heart.

674
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:58,479
It's not, gee, this is so overwhelming, it just must be made in heaven and last forever.

675
00:55:58,479 --> 00:55:59,760
How could it be otherwise?

676
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,440
That's not what happens.

677
00:56:01,439 --> 00:56:05,600
He's made the movement of resignation, so it's got to be something else.

678
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,840
Now, I'm catching up here.

679
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:09,200
Let me see.

680
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:13,839
And it's absurd from any rational, reflective, thinking point of view.

681
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:19,120
I think I said that a dozen times already, and I'm sure I must have found it here too.

682
00:56:19,439 --> 00:56:20,159
Yep.

683
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,479
So what is the absurd here?

684
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:23,680
It's not the improbable.

685
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,960
We said that.

686
00:56:26,479 --> 00:56:29,680
It's tied in with what he calls faith.

687
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:32,319
Let me see now if I need to read that.

688
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:34,480
No, that's fine too.

689
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,520
There's a little parenthetical lesson here.

690
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,799
I still have time.

691
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:46,079
Don't have some kind of stock response to these words like absurd.

692
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:49,279
This is something that goes wrong in people's papers sometimes.

693
00:56:49,279 --> 00:56:59,279
Just as God doesn't mean for Kierkegaard what you'd expect it to mean, because God, quote, is that all things are possible and that all things are possible is God.

694
00:56:59,279 --> 00:57:03,119
God is the field in which even the impossible is possible.

695
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:06,160
It's a very strange meaning of God.

696
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:23,319
But the the absurd for him is very different than the absurd for Sartre, say, where the absurd means pure freedom, that there's no reason to choose one thing rather than another, and you just have to act without any justification, and therefore all your actions are absurd.

697
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:30,359
Moreover, you're so free that even though you act and commit yourself, the next moment you're free to take back your commitment or not.

698
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:32,040
So it isn't really a commitment.

699
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,319
That's absurd.

700
00:57:33,319 --> 00:57:43,160
And then there's Camus kind of absurdity, that what we expect from the world is some kind of guarantee, but we just don't get it.

701
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:46,600
We can't get that kind of absolute guarantee.

702
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,840
Therefore, it's all absurd.

703
00:57:48,839 --> 00:57:50,999
That's certainly not what Kierkegaard is saying.

704
00:57:50,999 --> 00:58:00,040
The interesting thing is that if you accept the absurd in the right way, you can act in such a way as to commit yourself forever.

705
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:04,440
So Sartre would be wrong, if Kierkegaard is right.

706
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:16,200
And moreover, when you do commit yourself, it's got a certain kind of guarantee and satisfies your need for the absolute, which Camus said you couldn't have.

707
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,399
Only it's absurd.

708
00:58:17,399 --> 00:58:20,119
So they're using absurd in totally different ways.

709
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:24,999
Absurd in Sartre and Camus means sort of the opposite of what absurd means in Kierkegaard.

710
00:58:24,999 --> 00:58:29,959
Because for Kierkegaard, what's absurd is that you commit yourself and it's forever.

711
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:32,680
You don't have to keep redoing it.

712
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:36,119
And it's on the answering of your call to do it.

713
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:43,880
It isn't just something you sort of flip a coin and you commit yourself to whoever it happens to point to, spin the bottle kind of commitment.

714
00:58:43,879 --> 00:58:44,840
Not at all.

715
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,719
It's your commitment.

716
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,079
It's forever.

717
00:58:49,399 --> 00:58:51,319
And that's what's absurd.

718
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:56,919
Now, so it's don't believe whatever you heard absurd before, and believe it if you read Sartre.

719
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:01,640
He's really describing something that is absurd, a certain kind of freedom you can have.

720
00:59:01,799 --> 00:59:10,959
Camus is certainly describing something that's absurd, namely human existence without the kind of God that we thought we needed from Camus' point of view.

721
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:16,400
But now we've got this other kind of thing, and that's what we want to know now.

722
00:59:16,399 --> 00:59:21,760
And now I'm going to, I just have time, which I know I'm going to take time to understand it for the movie.

723
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,000
But so, one more thing, and then I will be there.

724
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:30,960
Well, here's this mysterious phrase now that I'm going to explain, that Kierkegaard himself doesn't explain.

725
00:59:30,959 --> 00:59:33,200
The bottom of 65.

726
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:39,680
This is about Abraham sacrificing Isaac, but never let Abraham and Isaac's story confuse you.

727
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,199
Stick to the phenomenon.

728
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:46,880
So, Abraham sacrificing Isaac just means that Abraham had a defining commitment to Isaac.

729
00:59:46,879 --> 00:59:50,000
Isaac was going to make Abraham the father of the faith.

730
00:59:49,999 --> 00:59:58,240
If Abraham kills Isaac, his whole world is lost, what it means to be Abraham, what he was going to do for the world, and so forth.

731
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:03,599
And so, but now, then comes near the bottom of 65.

732
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:09,920
His faith was not that he would be happy sometime in the hereafter, but that he would find blessed happiness here in the world.

733
01:00:09,919 --> 01:00:15,120
God would give him a new Isaac, bring the sacrificial offer back to life.

734
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:20,560
He believed on the strength of the absurd, for all human calculation had long since been suspended.

735
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,319
Boy, is that weird.

736
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,240
And it goes by so fast.

737
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:29,920
Yet the whole thing doesn't make any sense unless you can understand what that could possibly mean.

738
01:00:29,919 --> 01:00:34,720
Well, first, one thing it can't mean is a famous movie called Ordette.

739
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:41,999
By the way, next time I hand you out a page, I'm going to list about the seven movies that I talked about at various points because people have asked me to.

740
01:00:41,999 --> 01:01:03,720
There's a Danish movie called Ordette, in which the hero has been reading Kierkegaard, been reading Fear and Trembling, and when the woman, the most important woman, I forget whether she's his wife or not, dies, he stands in front of her coffin at the end of the movie with so much faith that she must not die that she gets up out of her coffin.

741
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:06,440
That's not what Kierkegaard has in mind.

742
01:01:06,439 --> 01:01:09,319
That's the improbable, and it isn't getting.

743
01:01:09,319 --> 01:01:14,039
And Kierkegaard wants to leave space for losing your Isaac and getting a new Isaac.

744
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,880
But how can you do that?

745
01:01:15,879 --> 01:01:19,160
Well, that's now I'm going to tell you how I think you do it.

746
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,479
I think, and again, it's the phenomenon.

747
01:01:21,479 --> 01:01:24,359
Kierkegaard knows that it must be so somehow.

748
01:01:24,359 --> 01:01:25,319
Why does he know?

749
01:01:25,319 --> 01:01:43,319
Because in the world of the spirit, it must be so that if you've got the energy to constantly commit yourself and get more and more involved in your Isaac and your defining commitment, then somehow it must be the case that you will always have a defining commitment.

750
01:01:43,319 --> 01:01:53,640
Even if it requires the new paradox, that you can somehow get a new commitment and yet keep your old identity.

751
01:01:53,640 --> 01:02:04,440
And how can you, you just got yourself defined in terms of your Isaac, of your unconditional commitment, your Beatrice, and now she's gone or he's gone.

752
01:02:04,439 --> 01:02:09,319
And now what can how can you get out of the forever that you got yourself into?

753
01:02:09,319 --> 01:02:11,560
Well, that's what I'm going to try to explain.

754
01:02:11,879 --> 01:02:36,640
That all the further Kierkegaard gets is that if you dwell on the image of the past one and try to hold on to that memory, and that that's what, and you can, and you know you can always do that, if that's what makes you able to commit yourself, it won't work because you're only committing yourself to the infinite eternal part.

755
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:41,119
You haven't got anything finite and temporal that's meaningful in your life.

756
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:44,640
You made it safe by making it irrelevant.

757
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,080
So, how do you do it?

758
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:50,160
Well, you do it the way people do it all the time.

759
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,879
I mean, it's really not as mysterious as it sounds.

760
01:02:52,879 --> 01:02:56,319
I wonder if anybody has seen what the phenomena is.

761
01:02:56,319 --> 01:03:02,080
What happens when somebody who loves somebody loses the person they love?

762
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:10,640
I mean, they can go into resignation, they can just sort of give up, but that's there's something else positive that can happen.

763
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,480
They can go into grief.

764
01:03:12,479 --> 01:03:21,040
Kierkegaard doesn't understand grief, but he sort of knows that there has to be such a thing because otherwise, in the world of the spirit, things won't work out right.

765
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:26,799
Because in the world of the spirit, when you Isaac dies sometimes, the sword falls on the head of the beloved.

766
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:28,479
I mean, he's not going to deny that.

767
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:30,559
They all realize that.

768
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:37,440
That's part of what the night of resignation and the knight of faith both realize: that the finite is vulnerable.

769
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:39,279
So, what happens in grief?

770
01:03:39,279 --> 01:03:50,240
Well, what happens in grief is that you take, you, well, it's something paradoxical that really happens.

771
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,799
Eternity changes in time.

772
01:03:53,120 --> 01:04:01,600
You get, when you got the forever in time, it looked like what happened was you're living along in this series of moments.

773
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:08,400
You get the instant, and that's going to tell you what you were lacking all along and what you're going to have from now on.

774
01:04:08,399 --> 01:04:10,079
And that tells you that's your identity.

775
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,080
That's what makes you an individual.

776
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,160
Well, something else can happen.

777
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,359
This can change without changing.

778
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:18,599
I don't want to be mysterious.

779
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:19,880
It means the following.

780
01:04:19,879 --> 01:04:29,000
It means that you become the person who loved and lost the princess, and that still defines you.

781
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:36,279
The way you are and the way your world is is totally marked by the fact that you loved and lost the princess.

782
01:04:36,279 --> 01:04:42,600
But if you do that the right way, you're open to another relationship.

783
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:46,680
And that's because you haven't stuck with the first one.

784
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:54,760
And it's the difference between, and in my slogan sort of, if you dwell on the relationship, then you're stuck.

785
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,920
You become an eye of resignation.

786
01:04:56,919 --> 01:05:00,359
You just keep it in front of you, even though the other person was gone.

787
01:05:00,359 --> 01:05:03,000
You just keep remembering how great it was.

788
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:14,919
If you dwell in the relationship, that is, if you see everything in your life and the world, in terms of the fact that you've had this relationship, you're open to a possible new Isaac.

789
01:05:14,919 --> 01:05:15,879
You get a new one.

790
01:05:15,959 --> 01:05:21,880
When I taught this at MIT, I had a way of explaining it that will work around here too.

791
01:05:22,439 --> 01:05:24,920
My MIT picture was this.

792
01:05:24,919 --> 01:05:31,880
And so here's X and has a defining commitment for A.

793
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:41,160
Now, either, and here's the resignation person now, when A, and now we ask what happens when A dies or leaves.

794
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:46,279
Well, the defining, the resignation person has put A in brackets.

795
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:58,600
By that I mean he's got the eternal significance of A, sort of bracketed out safely from anything temporal and eternal, and he dwells on it and keeps it.

796
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,959
What happens over here is much more interesting and mysterious.

797
01:06:01,959 --> 01:06:41,760
With grief, this person can become the person who loved and lost A and who's now open to B because they haven't betrayed their defining commitment that still defines them, but it defines them in such a way that's what they, what the world of the Spirit allows them to do is to relate in such a way to A, to incorporate it through grief, or to interiorize it, and then not lose it, not betray it, but live out of it in a way that gets them a new Isaac.

798
01:06:41,999 --> 01:06:46,720
I'm just filling in the phenomena that Kierkegaard knows, but he doesn't know that he knows it.

799
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:51,439
He knows it because he knows in the world of the Spirit, it's all going to be all right.

800
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,119
And he knows that that means that Abraham could get a new Isaac.

801
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:56,640
But how can Abraham get a new Isaac?

802
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,560
His life is defined in terms of Isaac.

803
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:00,879
His world is defined in terms of Isaac.

804
01:07:00,879 --> 01:07:06,159
Well, by having a way of relating.

805
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:11,999
You don't do this right away, of course, or you're in some kind of weird thing over here.

806
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:21,999
But the sense that you can get a new Isaac enables you to completely devote yourself to the defining cause or person.

807
01:07:21,999 --> 01:07:26,959
And you sense that you will always have a defining cause or person.

808
01:07:26,959 --> 01:07:28,399
That's what the new Isaac means.

809
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,760
It doesn't mean you get a clone of the Isaac you had.

810
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,799
It means you get a new object for your defining commitment.

811
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:37,680
It means that you can totally go into this one.

812
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,879
Now comes something else.

813
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:44,480
You can't go into this defining commitment thinking, oh, well, if I lose them, it's okay.

814
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:47,359
I can always just interiorize them and get another one.

815
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,039
That's very important.

816
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:50,999
Grief is paradoxic.

817
01:07:50,999 --> 01:08:00,999
When you're in grief, you think, you feel that you've lost the one person that really would have been the right person for you, and you lost them, and that's that.

818
01:08:00,999 --> 01:08:08,600
And life is either, you can either keep the ideal of the relation or you can just go back to lower immediacy, but you had it.

819
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,359
That's how it feels.

820
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:16,680
You can't say to yourself in grief, oh yeah, but I know that I'll get over grief and get another one.

821
01:08:16,999 --> 01:08:18,999
That's not the way it works.

822
01:08:18,999 --> 01:08:35,720
I mean, the grief is a paradoxical emotion in which you feel this is it, this is a disaster, this is the end of a certain life, and you feel that I'll always have some object of a defining relation.

823
01:08:36,039 --> 01:08:38,999
How you can have both of those, I don't know.

824
01:08:38,999 --> 01:08:40,999
So you could call it absurd.

825
01:08:42,199 --> 01:08:44,760
It's a paradoxical emotion.

826
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:58,760
But if you can live that paradoxical emotion, then you can get, it isn't, you see, you can't, and maybe that's why Kierkegaard doesn't talk about it, and I shouldn't be talking about it.

827
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:11,479
You can't use it to fall back on and say, okay, I can get as involved as I please with the person I care about and who's my defining commitment, because after all, if they die, I'll just go through grief and then I'll get another.

828
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:27,319
I mean, it's true that somehow one does have a sense that even the impossible is possible, and that you can keep your identity, and even if the other person dies, and yet be open to get a new person.

829
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:31,399
But you can't really, you know, you can't think it.

830
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,239
You can't count on it.

831
01:09:33,239 --> 01:09:35,919
You can't do it on purpose.

832
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:51,520
But so, so all that Kierkegaard can say is that Abraham acted as if he sensed that he would have a new Isaac, even though he knew that it was impossible that if he killed Isaac, Isaac was dead.

833
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:56,079
And if Isaac is dead, that's the end because he's only got his one definition in Isaac.

834
01:09:56,079 --> 01:10:00,079
Abraham has this sort of contradictory way of acting.

835
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:02,399
That's the paradox of existence.

836
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,600
But it works.

837
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,559
I mean, that's what I just want to show on the board here.

838
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:16,640
There is an experience which stands behind this weird sentence, which goes by once in the book, as far as I know.

839
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:21,359
God will give him a new Isaac or bring the sacrificial offer back to life.

840
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:26,879
So, or death is the wrong way bringing the lady in the coffin back to life by faith.

841
01:10:26,879 --> 01:10:29,039
That doesn't help any.

842
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:46,879
But I think the idea of getting a new Isaac, my picture here of this, and I'll say it one more time: interiorizing, incorporating as part of your identity that you had this love and that you lost it, makes it possible to have another.

843
01:10:46,879 --> 01:10:50,079
That's a new Isaac, meaning a new defining commitment.

844
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,279
That's the big deal.

845
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,799
Now, good, we got four minutes.

846
01:10:52,799 --> 01:10:53,600
Say something.

847
01:11:03,999 --> 01:11:05,279
New Isaac.

848
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:06,239
Well, good.

849
01:11:06,959 --> 01:11:10,319
Except that the thing is that Abraham, what does he say here?

850
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:15,999
Maybe you've got Abraham, his faith was not, remember, that he would be blessing the other world.

851
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:44,999
His faith was, I'm glad he doesn't say he believed, but if you say his faith was that God could give him a new Isaac, you've got to read that as saying he lived in such a way that he could only live that way, you know, in a field of faith in which he knew somehow that it would always be all right, even though he also knew that it would be a disaster.

852
01:11:44,999 --> 01:11:47,399
It would make his life impossible.

853
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:52,199
I mean, if he actually believed, oh, well, I can kill Isaac.

854
01:11:52,199 --> 01:11:55,959
God will give me a new Isaac, that would be bad news.

855
01:11:55,959 --> 01:12:04,919
He's just got to, you've got to say something like, he lived in such a way that he knew that in the world of the spirit, he would always have a defining commitment.

856
01:12:04,919 --> 01:12:07,559
It's like sort of getting grief too soon.

857
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:08,600
Yeah, you're right.

858
01:12:08,919 --> 01:12:20,119
He's got to, but if you take that away too much, then you can't understand how he would be able to kill Isaac or how they would, how the night of, how you'd be able to be making yourself more and more vulnerable.

859
01:12:20,119 --> 01:12:21,239
It's a tricky thing.

860
01:12:21,239 --> 01:12:22,839
You're on the right track.

861
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:38,839
It's got to be a way of life, a paradox of how you live, that you both base everything on this relationship, get more involved in it, know that it's, sense that it's insecure, and sense that it's okay.

862
01:12:38,839 --> 01:12:40,119
You get the last word.

863
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:52,039
Oh, well, that's easy.

864
01:12:52,039 --> 01:12:58,359
I mean, what Martin Luther King would have, if the peace marches failed, he would go through grief.

865
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:59,559
He would be lost.

866
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,879
He wouldn't know what to do when he woke up in the morning.

867
01:13:01,879 --> 01:13:03,640
And then he started what he really does.

868
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:04,959
You know, this is funny.

869
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:09,119
If you if you're if you succeed, you're equally in trouble on this.

870
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:13,680
What he really does, let's just make up a story which isn't much wrong about Martin Luther King.

871
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:14,319
He succeeded.

872
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:23,839
The peace marks worked, the peace marches worked, the black people got at least in principle justice, which is finally getting more and more worked out.

873
01:13:23,839 --> 01:13:28,479
He saw the promised land from the mountain, and then what?

874
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:32,399
Well, he didn't know what to do, and he became an anti-Vietnam war person.

875
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,239
He just took on a new cause.

876
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:36,319
He got a new that's his new Isaac.

877
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:41,919
Didn't work very well because he wasn't around very long afterward, and it didn't seem like it really grabbed him.

878
01:13:41,919 --> 01:13:44,239
But in principle, you could it would be the same.

879
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:50,799
You would get a new cause and you wouldn't give up but you had the old cause and either succeeded in it or failed in it.

880
01:13:50,799 --> 01:13:53,680
That would be and here's the crucial thing I haven't said.

881
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,919
This is very important for the movie.

882
01:13:55,919 --> 01:13:56,560
Very important.

883
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:57,839
How could I not say it?

884
01:13:57,839 --> 01:14:03,519
It will be in terms of your first relationship that you will get your second one.

885
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:08,640
That it's because it'll be through your first world that you will get your second world.

886
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:12,079
That's got to be that's how it is to have it here.

887
01:14:12,079 --> 01:14:22,079
I mean, it becomes so much a part of you when you dwell in it that it opens you up to the new possibility, the new relation.

888
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:26,560
You and now you are all looking, or at least you are, and I understand, very puzzled.

889
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:27,439
That's fine.

890
01:14:27,839 --> 01:14:29,600
You're going to see the movie next time.

891
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:34,319
All of this is going to be showing you in a very convincing way.

892
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:40,159
Let me just make sure that I haven't, that I'm not going to discover something that I wish I hadn't gotten.

893
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:42,479
Yep, that's it.

894
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:42,959
Okay.
