1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,601
But I have to go back to the one Karamatsov that I haven't talked about.

2
00:00:05,601 --> 00:00:07,601
And he's not really a Karamatsov.

3
00:00:07,601 --> 00:00:10,241
He's at most half a Karamatsov.

4
00:00:10,241 --> 00:00:13,600
And nobody ever calls him a Karamatsov.

5
00:00:13,601 --> 00:00:15,200
And that is Smerzhikov.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,081
But Smerzhikov is an important character in the book.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,800
So we have to get him lined up with all the other Karamatsovs.

8
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:40,400
That is, he is the illegitimate son of old Karamatsov by way of some sort of bag lady street person that he just, I don't know, on a bet, he just fathered a child with her.

9
00:00:40,401 --> 00:00:47,720
And the important thing is to understand what kind of character this guy is and how he got that way.

10
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:55,400
So starting, he turns out to be arrogant and despises everyone.

11
00:00:55,881 --> 00:00:58,601
At the top of 140, we're going to start.

12
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:04,040
He was a young man, about 24, remarkably unsociable and self-contained.

13
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,800
Not that he was shy or bashful.

14
00:01:05,801 --> 00:01:09,800
On the contrary, he was conceited and seemed to despise everyone.

15
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:17,561
Can you already tell which of the other brothers of the real Karamatsov three brothers he's most like?

16
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,640
Ivan, absolutely.

17
00:01:19,721 --> 00:01:25,080
Turns out he also is the same age as Ivan, 24 years old.

18
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:34,441
Dostoevsky is obviously going out of his way to identify in some way Smershikov and Ivan.

19
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:40,121
And as you get further into the book, you will see that that turns out to be very important.

20
00:01:40,121 --> 00:01:45,080
And now comes the most amazing thing, also on page 140.

21
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,040
I don't know how many of you could even remember this, because it's hard to remember things that are so weird.

22
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,040
I didn't even notice it for years.

23
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,520
Now I think it's absolutely amazing genius to come up with such a thing.

24
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,481
Do you remember what Smershikov likes to do as a child when he was little?

25
00:02:02,441 --> 00:02:03,080
What?

26
00:02:04,281 --> 00:02:05,801
Hang cats, right?

27
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,720
So there it is, the middle of the page.

28
00:02:07,721 --> 00:02:11,640
In his childhood, not the middle of the page, about 10 lines down.

29
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,881
In his childhood, he liked to hang cats and bury them with great ceremony.

30
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:22,921
He used to dress up in a sheet as though it were a surplice and sing and wave some object over the dead cat as though it were a censer.

31
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,200
That's all Catholic mass costume and behavior.

32
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,081
All he did, all he did on the slide with the greatest secrecy.

33
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:39,280
So it took me a long time to even have any clue as to why that was in there.

34
00:02:39,281 --> 00:02:48,400
Then some smart student said, and I think it's right, that it's a kind of parody of the two factors of the self.

35
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:57,200
That there is the dark side of Smerchikov that hangs the cats and the good side of Smeryakov that says mass over them.

36
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:06,881
It's a very perverted, peculiar form of two factors, but it is a kind of minimal self that he's got.

37
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:23,680
But it turns out that he's only got this minimal self for a while, and then it gets wiped out because he's an interesting case of a negative childhood memory.

38
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:30,960
He's got a memory that, in effect, tells him that he's not got a self at all.

39
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:42,721
And after that, you never hear anything more of him having anything either negative and dark or sort of religious at all.

40
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,401
And we have to follow that briefly.

41
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,241
So we're still in 140.

42
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:54,001
What happened then, in the middle of the page, Gregory used to say to all this he did on the slide.

43
00:03:54,561 --> 00:03:56,881
All this he did on the slide with the greatest secrecy.

44
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,601
Gregory caught him once and beat him.

45
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,080
He shrank into a corner and so forth.

46
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,400
Now, what Gregory says is important.

47
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,161
He doesn't care for you or me, the beast, Gregory used to say to Marfa.

48
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:09,840
He doesn't care for anyone.

49
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,601
Then, speaking directly to the boy, he asks, Are you a human being?

50
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,241
That's like, do you have a self?

51
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:17,001
You're not a human being.

52
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:19,241
You grew from the mildew in the bathhouse.

53
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:20,760
That's what you are.

54
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,960
And now you can see it becomes a negative childhood memory.

55
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,920
Smerzhikov, it appears afterwards, could never forgive Gregory those words.

56
00:04:28,921 --> 00:04:40,600
And if you follow what happens with Smershikov, you see that it turns out that he doesn't have any lofty impulses or any lackey impulses.

57
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,160
He just doesn't have any impulses at all.

58
00:04:43,161 --> 00:04:56,360
You see it on page 142, where he does have one thing he likes to do, and it is so minimal that you could hardly call it lofty or lackey.

59
00:04:56,441 --> 00:04:57,561
The middle of the page.

60
00:04:57,561 --> 00:05:02,600
He came back to us from Moscow, well-dressed in a clean coat and clean linen.

61
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,640
Remember, that's the impeccable side of Yvonne being copied.

62
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:19,321
He brushed his clothes most scrupulously twice a day and was very fond of cleaning his smart taff boots with a special English polish so that they shone like mirrors.

63
00:05:19,321 --> 00:05:21,960
That's the thing he's most fond of.

64
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:28,361
Not people, not men, not women, not food, not anything else.

65
00:05:28,921 --> 00:05:34,681
But he was a cook, but you'll see in a minute that he didn't seem to be interested in what he ate, what he cooked.

66
00:05:34,681 --> 00:05:36,760
He turned out to be a first-rate cook.

67
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:42,760
Theodore Karamaza paid him a salary, and he used it on clothes, pomade, perfume, and such.

68
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,840
But he seemed to have as much contempt for the female sex, as for men.

69
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,960
He was discreet, almost unapproachable with them.

70
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,721
So he's not interested in men.

71
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,321
He's not interested in women.

72
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:55,640
He's not interested in anything.

73
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,121
And that's very important about him.

74
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:06,801
Again, he lacks the sensual side and he lacks the spiritual side, the earthy and the heavenly, however you want to say.

75
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:09,200
He lacks just a second the two factors.

76
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,281
So he doesn't even flee taking a stand on the factors.

77
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,400
He doesn't even have a kind of despair which he's hiding.

78
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,881
He's really not a human being.

79
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:25,200
He's a sort of a kind of zombie when you get right down to it.

80
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:34,001
And as I say, nobody ever calls him a Karamatsov because he doesn't have the self-problem that all Karamatsovs have.

81
00:06:35,441 --> 00:06:37,600
But then this leads to a funny problem.

82
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:46,400
If he doesn't care about anything, how does he get motivated to do anything besides polish his boots, which he seems to care?

83
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,080
Well, that's a very interesting problem for Dostoevsky.

84
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,681
And keep your eye open.

85
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:54,400
It's very important for the quote of the book.

86
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:08,481
Where does Mary Juko get his desires and his goals and his sort of model for how to act, which sort of replaces him having any really any desires at all?

87
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,160
Ah, Beatrice, what?

88
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:10,960
Yeah?

89
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:17,681
Didn't he could have a great deal of contempt for the other four we need?

90
00:07:17,681 --> 00:07:20,240
Which is a very bad sign, of course.

91
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,321
You know, Russia's the okay, well, he has a contempt.

92
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:27,281
Remember, he has a disdain and a contempt for everybody.

93
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,361
He has a negative impulse.

94
00:07:29,521 --> 00:07:34,081
But how is there anybody in the book that he admires and respects?

95
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,161
You don't know yet, probably.

96
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,960
There is, and it's going to turn out to be extremely important.

97
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,401
You can guess who it would be.

98
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:45,961
He's impeccably dressing.

99
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:49,961
He's having this disdain for everybody.

100
00:07:50,281 --> 00:07:56,281
He's so sort of wrapped up in himself that he doesn't relate to anybody.

101
00:07:56,281 --> 00:08:01,321
Doesn't that begin to remind you of somebody was sort of the grossest version of somebody?

102
00:08:01,321 --> 00:08:02,441
Of Yvonne, yeah.

103
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:05,081
He's like a parody of Yvonne.

104
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,081
And that, just bear that in mind and watch it develop.

105
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,561
It develops pretty quickly later.

106
00:08:11,561 --> 00:08:14,681
Well, maybe halfway on in the book.

107
00:08:14,681 --> 00:08:19,401
So, by the way, halfway on in the book, I want to tell you what to do for next time.

108
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,041
Next time, we're going to do the Grand Inquisitor.

109
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,761
So bring the Grand Inquisitor page.

110
00:08:24,761 --> 00:08:27,480
And if you don't have it, it's that white one down there.

111
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,721
Pick it up when you leave or print it.

112
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:35,241
And be sure to read 279 to 302.

113
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:43,401
Whether you ever, if unfortunately for you, you haven't got that far, what did I say?

114
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,081
279 to 302?

115
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,881
That's the Grand Inquisitor.

116
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,641
It's a separate thing.

117
00:08:53,641 --> 00:09:01,561
You can skip to it without losing your understanding of the plot and without anything being given away.

118
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:08,921
But if you don't read it for sure by next Tuesday, you would just not, you might as well not come because you won't understand anything.

119
00:09:08,921 --> 00:09:17,961
As I said about today, which I'm going to start talking about now, if you haven't read the part on rebellion, you might as well go out and enjoy the fresh air.

120
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,561
But we're going to do a rebellion now for the rest of the time.

121
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,521
So we're going to talk about Yvonne.

122
00:09:24,521 --> 00:09:27,401
Remember, Yvonne wants to be perfect.

123
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:50,001
And to get, which, of course, that aspect of Yvonne that Smerzhikov doesn't really understand, except maybe in the parody of the very perfectly polished boots, that Yvonne wants to be perfect by getting rid of everything base, earthy, sensual in himself and become completely refined, completely pure, and completely self-sufficient.

124
00:09:50,321 --> 00:09:58,401
So he doesn't want to get close to anybody, but he does have this attraction for Katerina, his existential double.

125
00:09:58,401 --> 00:10:01,361
But what he says to Alyasha is interesting.

126
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:12,161
He says that he only can get close to somebody when they're about to leave, or he's about to leave, on 259, 258.

127
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:21,681
At the bottom paragraph, I want to get to know you once and for all, he says to Alyasha, and I want you to know me, and then we will say goodbye.

128
00:10:21,681 --> 00:10:25,281
I believe it's always best to get to know people just before leaving them.

129
00:10:25,281 --> 00:10:27,681
In other words, don't get involved.

130
00:10:27,681 --> 00:10:29,120
There are really people like that.

131
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,360
You may know some people like that.

132
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:39,681
I know a few who can only really get close to somebody and intimate with somebody when they're sure that they're about to leave.

133
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:45,681
That's in the film Breathless, that's part of what's going on.

134
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,441
But that's typical of Yvonne.

135
00:10:50,161 --> 00:11:06,480
But while he's with Alyasha, anyway, and knowing that it's okay because they're all going to get separated and they won't get involved with each other, he does decide to tell Alyasha everything basic and important to him.

136
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:18,681
On 265, the middle of the page, he says, I am trying to explain as quickly as possible my essential nature, that is, what manner of man I am, what I believe in, for what I hope.

137
00:11:18,681 --> 00:11:20,761
That's it, isn't it?

138
00:11:20,761 --> 00:11:24,521
And that's what he then proceeds to do.

139
00:11:24,521 --> 00:11:28,281
That's what the rebellion story is all about.

140
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:35,081
And he's going to tell Alyacha his stand towards life, and it's really despair.

141
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,801
I mean, but it's right out in the open, it's despair.

142
00:11:37,801 --> 00:11:44,200
Because it's all about when and why he's going to commit suicide, though he never says it in so many words.

143
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,241
It's clear that that's what he's going to talk about.

144
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,801
So, but first he has to sort of clear some things out of the way, which he does.

145
00:11:51,801 --> 00:12:03,720
So, on 259, at the beginning of the conversation, he makes clear that it's not going to be what, no, I've jumped too fast to 259, just a second.

146
00:12:04,681 --> 00:12:05,801
No, that's fine.

147
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:13,001
Look at, the important thing, this is where he threatens suicide and explains what he's going to do.

148
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,841
The middle of 259.

149
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:28,601
Do you know, I've been sitting here thinking to myself that if I didn't believe in life, if I lost faith in the woman I love, which is sort of funny because he says he loves Flatarina, but everybody else says he only loves himself and he doesn't love anybody.

150
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,400
And you could, if you keep your eyes open, you'll find those phrases.

151
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:36,361
You can underline them because they're sort of scattered around in the book, and I didn't find them.

152
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:43,080
But I thought, I mean, it's whatever it is to love somebody for Ivan, it's not what anybody else recognizes as loving them.

153
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:48,041
I lost faith in the woman I love, lost faith in the order of things, as if he ever had any.

154
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:55,321
We're convinced in the fact that everything is a disorderly, damnable, and perhaps devil-ridden chaos, more like what he thinks.

155
00:12:55,321 --> 00:13:00,481
If I were struck by every horror of man's disillusionment, still I would want to live.

156
00:12:59,161 --> 00:13:05,360
Having once tasted of the cup, the cup of life, that is, this is all sorted in code.

157
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:12,961
Having once tasted of the cup, I would not turn away from it, that means commit suicide, till I had drained it.

158
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:19,841
At 30, though, I shall be sure to leave the cup, even if I've not emptied it, and turn away where I don't know.

159
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:27,121
Well, it gets a little clearer why he's going to turn away, and that it means dying.

160
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:33,921
But till I'm 30, I know that my youth will triumph over everything, every disillusion, every disgust with life.

161
00:13:33,921 --> 00:13:44,801
I've asked myself many times whether there is in the world any despair that could overcome this frantic search for thirst for life, and I've come to the conclusion that there isn't, that is till I'm 30.

162
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:50,080
Some dribbling, consumptive moralists and poets especially call that thirst for life base.

163
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:55,681
It's a feature of the Karamatsovs, to be sure, the thirst for life, regardless of everything.

164
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,321
And you probably have it too.

165
00:13:58,321 --> 00:14:02,880
Okay, so he's saying, you know, he can't help loving the sticky green leaves.

166
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:10,481
He can't help, I suppose, finding Katerina sexually or erotically attractive in some way.

167
00:14:12,161 --> 00:14:18,001
But all of that, he thinks, is not essential to who he is, and he'll outgrow it.

168
00:14:18,321 --> 00:14:21,361
That's that half of the self isn't the real Yvonne.

169
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:37,361
The real Yvonne would just go on living a life free of all the sensuality and all the impulses and desires and lower immediacy after he outgrew them, since they weren't important anyway.

170
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:45,161
But the trouble is that there's something else wrong with the world which prevents him from wanting to stay alive after 30.

171
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:55,720
As soon as the sort of impulse grip of the world wears off, it's clear that he's going to throw away the cup, but we don't know why yet.

172
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,481
We'll find out in a minute.

173
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,960
So in 268, what is on 268?

174
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:07,960
Oh, he's talking about how he can't love people at close quarters, which contradicts the Katarina thing, among other things.

175
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,681
The middle.

176
00:15:08,681 --> 00:15:14,921
One can love one's neighbors in the abstract, and even at a distance, but at close quarters, it's almost impossible.

177
00:15:14,921 --> 00:15:23,241
Remember, I said when he's not, he's a lover of humanity in general, but he doesn't like any human beings in particular.

178
00:15:23,401 --> 00:15:26,121
Now, we're ready to.

179
00:15:26,441 --> 00:15:29,801
And it's Fedor who says he doesn't love anybody.

180
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:36,121
So Ivan is attached to the world and the people and the leaves and the spring and all that.

181
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,561
But really deeply, he's not involved.

182
00:15:39,561 --> 00:15:41,001
He doesn't love anything.

183
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:45,321
He always is protecting himself from getting involved in anything.

184
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:50,680
And he will get rid of the sensual and the involved as soon as possible.

185
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,440
And he has to do it.

186
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,200
Now, that's all background.

187
00:15:54,201 --> 00:15:55,721
Now comes the fun part.

188
00:15:55,721 --> 00:16:04,760
And I remember I told you, think about this argument now that he's going to give and see if you're convinced or not and why you are or aren't.

189
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:09,880
He's going to tell Alyasha what he firmly, deeply believes.

190
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,120
It starts on 265.

191
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:21,321
The first thing he does is sort of sensibly get God out of the story, not because he says that he doesn't believe in God.

192
00:16:21,721 --> 00:16:32,561
It's just that what he's going to talk about is sort of his existential stance, that is how he relates to life, and not some metaphysical question about whether there's a God or not.

193
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,400
And he thinks that, and it's sort of like Pascal, that we can't know whether there's a God or not.

194
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:48,000
I think I told you, Pascal says in the Pensées, I don't think I put it in the handout, we can prove the existence of God, and we can prove the non-existence of God.

195
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:52,400
And therefore, it doesn't do any good to try to think about it.

196
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:59,840
So he says at the bottom of 265, I have a Euclidean earthly mind, and so how can I solve problems that are not of this world?

197
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:05,760
And I'd advise you never to think about it either, Alyasha, especially about God, whether he exists or not.

198
00:17:05,761 --> 00:17:10,480
All such questions are utterly inappropriate for a mind created for three dimensions.

199
00:17:10,481 --> 00:17:20,080
So all this is to say, don't get involved in this sort of Platonic, Greek, abstract, philosophical way of thinking.

200
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,441
That's not what matters.

201
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:26,160
What matters is what your attitude is toward living your life in this world.

202
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:28,961
So he says, I accept God and I'm glad to.

203
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:33,200
I accept his wisdom, and it's completely beyond our knowledge.

204
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,160
But then comes what, well, what is his stat?

205
00:17:36,241 --> 00:17:37,120
What is important?

206
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,200
His importance is how he relates to the world.

207
00:17:41,201 --> 00:17:48,400
And about 12 lines down, he says on 266, yet I would, yet, would you believe it in the final result?

208
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,801
I don't accept this world of gods.

209
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:57,600
So it's this creation, this world, that Yvonne wants to reject.

210
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:12,720
And he's going to, and that's what it means for him to throw away the cup and get out of this world and, and in effect, commit suicide, as soon as he can get disconnected from the sensuous attractions of things, which aren't really him anyway.

211
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:26,041
So he's going to prove now to Alyasha that if you're a decent person, then you wait a minute, let's see.

212
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:32,600
Okay, that any decent moral person is obliged to leave the world as soon as possible.

213
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:54,760
That as soon as the Karamatsov sensuous force weakens so that he can tear himself away from the world, that is when he's 30, then he will just have to get out of the world because there's something basically wrong with the world that any decent, impeccable moral person like Yvonne would have to reject.

214
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,680
And why does he think that?

215
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,160
Well, his reasoning is a little bit complicated, not very.

216
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:11,960
The argument is the world is such a corrupt and evil place that no moral person should accept living in it.

217
00:19:11,961 --> 00:19:15,401
And that's what he's going to, and he makes a pretty clear case for this.

218
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,321
It's very convincing.

219
00:19:17,961 --> 00:19:28,200
You should ask yourself whether you're convinced, and then ask yourself if you are convinced, then why shouldn't you commit suicide when you're 30 also?

220
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,001
That is, is there something wrong with this argument?

221
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,440
Or has he really convinced you?

222
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,120
So how does he do it?

223
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,600
Well, how does he make his argument?

224
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:45,321
Well, he collects a dossier of instances of horrible child abuse.

225
00:19:45,321 --> 00:19:47,880
That's what he's talking about on 270.

226
00:19:48,201 --> 00:19:52,041
He says about a third of the way down, I like to collect certain facts.

227
00:19:52,201 --> 00:19:56,840
Would you believe I even copy anecdotes of a certain sort from newspapers and books?

228
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,440
I've already got a fine collection.

229
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,080
A fine isn't quite the right word.

230
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:04,640
The next time he describes it, he says it's nice.

231
00:20:04,961 --> 00:20:12,000
And now, that sounds like a subtle difference, but when you get there, you'll see why the right thing to say is that it's nice.

232
00:20:12,721 --> 00:20:15,360
But what that means right now, I can't explain yet.

233
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:23,761
So he has a dossier, but he also of these child abuses, which would seem to be bad enough that one ought to leave the world.

234
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:27,760
And he describes these awful things that people have done to children.

235
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:33,600
And then, but he, there are two possible objections he has to answer.

236
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:38,641
And one is maybe these sufferers deserve all this suffering.

237
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,720
They've been bad, and they've done bad things or had bad impulses.

238
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:51,840
And the second is, well, in the world of the other, in the other world, afterlife, it'll all be made up.

239
00:20:52,561 --> 00:21:01,521
The people who did the bad things will burn forever in hell, and the children who suffered these bad things will sing the praises of God forever in eternity.

240
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:02,880
What about that?

241
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,441
Well, he's got two interesting answers to that.

242
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,200
It's not too hard.

243
00:21:07,521 --> 00:21:10,400
He says the children are innocent.

244
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:24,241
It's a Greek Orthodox view, I've been told, that children are innocent up to the age of seven, which I think it may be, maybe Roman Catholic too, or at least French Catholic.

245
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,721
But it doesn't matter for this argument.

246
00:21:26,721 --> 00:21:32,640
At some age, children, obviously, from a very early age, children do annoying and nasty things.

247
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:32,880
St.

248
00:21:32,961 --> 00:21:34,481
Augustine is very good on this.

249
00:21:34,481 --> 00:21:45,001
He wants to prove that there's original sin, and he wants to say that little babies who aren't aware at all of good and evil and so forth are already evil, but they just don't know it.

250
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:46,600
And his example is interesting.

251
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,600
He says, you have two siblings or twins, maybe, I don't remember.

252
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:56,200
One of whom has already drunk as much of his mother's milk as he could possibly hold.

253
00:21:56,201 --> 00:22:00,920
He still gets jealous and cries if the mother offers her breast to the sibling.

254
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:15,721
And if that's true, and it probably is, it shows that what it's supposed to show is children do things like get selfish and jealous and possessive and so forth, but until they're seven, they don't know what they're doing.

255
00:22:15,721 --> 00:22:19,880
But after a while, they know that you shouldn't lie and shouldn't be greedy and so forth.

256
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:28,920
But the children that Yvonne collects are children who are under the age of knowing, so they're innocent.

257
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,041
They're always, this is Yvonne getting it wrong.

258
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:34,041
He says they're always sweet and lovable.

259
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:35,241
Augustine is right.

260
00:22:35,241 --> 00:22:44,120
They're not always sweet and lovable, but they're at least not guilty in a way that they should be tortured the way they are.

261
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:59,160
And now, though, he says on the middle, no, the bottom, the third of 268, but in the first place, children can be loved even at close quarters, even when they're dirty, even when they're ugly.

262
00:23:00,281 --> 00:23:04,201
And that is, they're not sinful.

263
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,840
We've just said that.

264
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:13,161
Now, he also says that the grown-ups can suffer.

265
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,961
That's all right.

266
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:15,321
But the children shouldn't.

267
00:23:15,321 --> 00:23:20,761
At the top of 274, at the top paragraph, I say nothing of the suffering of grown-ups.

268
00:23:20,761 --> 00:23:22,761
They have eaten the apple, damn them.

269
00:23:22,761 --> 00:23:25,480
That is, they know good and evil.

270
00:23:25,481 --> 00:23:27,561
And the devil take them all.

271
00:23:27,561 --> 00:23:33,521
But these little ones, and then poor Alyasha is really, really suffering from all these gory details.

272
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:35,441
I'm making you suffer, Alyasha.

273
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,200
I'll stop if you like.

274
00:23:37,201 --> 00:23:38,401
No, never mind.

275
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,120
I want to suffer too, muttered Alyasha.

276
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:54,480
And so now Yvonne has got his case against, I mean, there's no reason, just it's an outrage that these children should suffer who haven't, who are innocent.

277
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:58,880
And what about this other world where everything will be all right?

278
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:06,880
Well, Yvonne's got this interesting argument that punishing the child abusers isn't going to make things all right.

279
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,001
It's certainly going to increase the amount of suffering in the universe, but that's not what you want to do.

280
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:15,680
You want to get somehow fix the suffering of the children.

281
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,521
But they've already suffered.

282
00:24:17,521 --> 00:24:28,160
And you can't take back the fact that they were locked up in the outhouse or beaten by their parents or dogs turned on them by the Turks or whatever it was.

283
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,600
I've forgotten all these gory details.

284
00:24:32,481 --> 00:24:38,641
There's no way to comfort them for that, even if you rewarded them from then on.

285
00:24:38,961 --> 00:24:45,360
So even a higher harmony won't help, he says on 277, the middle of the page.

286
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,441
I renounce the higher harmony.

287
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:56,160
It's not worth the tears of one tortured child who beat himself on the breast with his little fist and prayed in the stinking outhouse with his tears to dear find God.

288
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,201
It's not worth it because those tears are unatoned for.

289
00:24:59,201 --> 00:25:02,480
They must be atoned for, or there can be no harmony.

290
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:03,121
But how?

291
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,200
How are you going to atone for them?

292
00:25:05,201 --> 00:25:06,801
Is it possible?

293
00:25:06,801 --> 00:25:09,521
And then by being avenged, no.

294
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,240
And there's no way.

295
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,121
So at the bottom, he says, I don't want harmony from love of humanity.

296
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,600
I don't want it.

297
00:25:16,761 --> 00:25:25,400
See, harmony would sort of try to cover up the unforgivable suffering by saying, ah, that they're happy now.

298
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,640
But that's not going to do it.

299
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,721
I would rather be left with unavenged suffering.

300
00:25:29,721 --> 00:25:32,600
I would rather remain with my at the top of 278.

301
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:37,000
I'd rather remain with my unavenged suffering and unsatisfied indignation.

302
00:25:37,001 --> 00:25:39,481
It's too high a price to pay for harmony.

303
00:25:39,481 --> 00:25:42,120
It's beyond our means to pay it.

304
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,440
So what follows from that?

305
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:52,120
Well, it follows from that that any decent person should leave the world.

306
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,400
Let's go.

307
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,521
It's all happening on 277 and 278.

308
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,121
By the way, anybody want to say anything?

309
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,001
I mean, I think there's plenty to say in a minute, but not yet.

310
00:26:01,001 --> 00:26:09,080
But if there is something that I'm missing or you want to say it, just don't get hypnotized.

311
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,041
Go ahead.

312
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:12,600
But I'll keep talking until you find what you want to say.

313
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:21,080
On 277, I just read the part about harmony at the bottom, and 278 at the top.

314
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,640
And then now comes the punchline at the top of 278.

315
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:28,600
And so I give back my entrance ticket.

316
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,880
And if I'm an honest man, I give it back as soon as possible.

317
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:41,880
You realize that's the story, that I stop drinking from the cup of life as soon as I stop being sensuously hooked on people and things.

318
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,960
And as soon as he can do it, he's got to get out of this world.

319
00:26:45,961 --> 00:26:51,160
I give back my entrance ticket, and if I'm an honest man, I give it back as soon as possible.

320
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,761
And that I'm doing it.

321
00:26:52,761 --> 00:26:53,961
And that I am doing.

322
00:26:53,961 --> 00:26:56,440
It's not God that I don't accept Alyasha.

323
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,080
I respectfully return the ticket to him.

324
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,680
And that's interesting.

325
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:12,480
He's saying that the world is so outrageously bad that no decent moral person would accept to live in it.

326
00:27:12,481 --> 00:27:16,400
And he pushes it then to the extreme.

327
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,880
But that's rebellion, murmured Alyasha, looking down.

328
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,840
Rebellion?

329
00:27:22,721 --> 00:27:24,881
I'm sorry you call it that, said Yvonne.

330
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,321
One can hardly live in rebellion, and I want to live.

331
00:27:28,321 --> 00:27:38,801
Well, he wants to live, but he has to give up living because the world is such a terrible place that it would be wrong to accept to live on those terms.

332
00:27:38,801 --> 00:27:43,281
And the argument is very interesting the way Dostoevsky sets it up here.

333
00:27:43,281 --> 00:27:57,600
I mean, the test would be whether this argument was convincing was to be whether Alyasha is convinced, because he is the most sensitive, the most sort of upbeat, the most always joyful person.

334
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,600
So will he buy this depressing argument from Yvonne?

335
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,161
And let's find out on 278.

336
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,840
I challenge you, answer.

337
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:12,960
Imagine that you were creating, this is Yvonne talking, a fabric of human destiny with the object of making men happy in the end.

338
00:28:12,961 --> 00:28:26,240
Imagine that you were doing this, that it's essential and inevitable to torture to death one tiny creature, that child beating its breast with its fist, for instance, in order to found that edifice on its unavenged tears.

339
00:28:26,241 --> 00:28:29,521
Would you consent to be the architect on those conditions?

340
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:31,840
Tell me, tell the truth.

341
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,001
And then, poor Alyasha, he's absolutely convinced.

342
00:28:36,001 --> 00:28:38,640
No, I wouldn't consent, said Alyasha.

343
00:28:38,961 --> 00:28:43,960
So it looks like Yvonne has made his point.

344
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:48,440
And the question is: let me see.

345
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,960
Yeah, it looks like Yvonne has made his point.

346
00:28:52,201 --> 00:28:53,480
Are you convinced?

347
00:28:53,721 --> 00:28:56,760
You're the Alyasha ones who just read it.

348
00:28:57,321 --> 00:29:06,760
Has he convinced you that if you're a decent person, you should get out of this world as soon as possible?

349
00:29:06,761 --> 00:29:16,360
And if he hasn't convinced you, sort of, what's the really philosophical question isn't whether you're convinced, but what's wrong with his argument if you're not convinced?

350
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:16,761
Yeah.

351
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,281
He's saying everyone in the world is bad, including man?

352
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,400
Yes.

353
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,041
He's saying, but that's a very interesting way to put it.

354
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:28,200
I have to digest what you said.

355
00:29:30,521 --> 00:29:32,200
The answer is yes and no.

356
00:29:32,201 --> 00:29:40,201
So let me give you the yes now, and I'll give you the no now and the yes later.

357
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:46,120
The no is it doesn't matter whether they're all as bad, including him.

358
00:29:46,120 --> 00:30:03,480
As soon as it's a world in which there are tortured children, it's a bad world because, I mean, nobody's revenging the tortured children, and even if they did sort of revenge on the person who did the torturing, the children are already tortured.

359
00:30:03,481 --> 00:30:11,641
And in a world in which God has set it up so the world works like that, that's a world that he doesn't want to have anything to do with.

360
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,720
He wouldn't make a world like that.

361
00:30:13,721 --> 00:30:19,801
Now, whether everybody is a child torturer, that's a very strange, strong claim.

362
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:23,080
But in the end, Yvonne makes it, but not yet.

363
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:26,281
And how come he makes it is very interesting.

364
00:30:26,521 --> 00:30:35,521
But it's enough for his argument if you just have one, remember, one child tortured by one person, and you shouldn't accept the world.

365
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:52,481
So it's clear he doesn't have to argue that there's anything but this one outrage, unavenged, unavengeable outrage, that then Haliasha won't accept that world, and you shouldn't either, he says.

366
00:30:52,481 --> 00:30:53,761
And I think he's right.

367
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,041
One shouldn't.

368
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:59,521
But then there must be something wrong with the question somehow, and we've got to figure out what it is.

369
00:30:59,521 --> 00:31:06,480
So Dostoevsky certainly wants you to finally understand something wrong about what Yvonne is saying.

370
00:31:06,801 --> 00:31:09,120
So let's put it this way.

371
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,880
So the question is: should each of us give back our ticket?

372
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,080
There seems to be, that is, should each of us get out of this world as soon as possible?

373
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:38,400
Because it's like saying if you were in a play, a spectator at a play, or if you were being wooed by a fraternity or a sorority, and you discovered that they were immoral, prejudiced, and the movie was sadistic and violent and so forth, you should walk out.

374
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,080
You should give back your ticket.

375
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:45,921
You shouldn't join that fraternity or sorority, or if you've joined, you should always, you just didn't know enough.

376
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,801
When you find out how prejudiced they are, for instance, you should leave.

377
00:31:50,801 --> 00:32:00,801
And he's saying, and if that's the way it is in the world, if you find yourself in a world which has values that you can't accept, you can just get out.

378
00:32:00,801 --> 00:32:03,041
Yes, so first you and then you, yeah.

379
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,961
And that's how the old fraternity around, you know.

380
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,561
But there's lack of death, I think, you know, oh.

381
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,240
There's no place to go.

382
00:32:12,721 --> 00:32:13,321
Okay.

383
00:32:13,321 --> 00:32:13,721
Yeah.

384
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,160
Well.

385
00:32:13,521 --> 00:32:18,041
I think I can just have it.

386
00:32:18,201 --> 00:32:21,960
You're giving the freedom to choose how you want to live your life.

387
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,721
But any other kind of you're kind of being empowered.

388
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:27,881
Well, well, let's let's see.

389
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,600
I see what you're saying, but he would have to say something.

390
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:38,840
He would say, like, but there's no way to face it, I mean, except by leaving, because here's this situation.

391
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:46,761
You don't control it, but if you don't want to be part of a world where it happens, it's like, that's why I say it's like the fraternity in the movie.

392
00:32:46,761 --> 00:32:52,120
No matter whether there's someplace else to go or not, you don't want to be in this situation.

393
00:32:52,120 --> 00:33:03,721
And if it's the whole world that's like this, then maybe just consider as a possibility that the only way to deal with it is to get out of the world, otherwise you become kind of an accomplice in it.

394
00:33:03,721 --> 00:33:05,001
That's what he's saying.

395
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,360
Something good.

396
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,440
Well, it's all part of the same world, I think.

397
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,080
That's the point.

398
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:18,680
If you could leave this world for second life, say, in which in that virtual world, nobody tortured children, that would be nice.

399
00:33:18,681 --> 00:33:22,840
But you can't leave this world just by going into some book.

400
00:33:23,161 --> 00:33:24,840
Ah, okay.

401
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,520
Aha.

402
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,880
You have now.

403
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,400
Can you hear her?

404
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:34,840
Why not be a good person and change the way the world is, try to fix the evil in the world?

405
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,921
She jumped way ahead of the story.

406
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,160
But you're absolutely on the right track.

407
00:33:39,161 --> 00:33:41,561
But we have to get there step by step.

408
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,520
We'll get there before the end of the hour.

409
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,120
We'll come back to your point.

410
00:33:46,121 --> 00:33:46,440
Yes?

411
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:56,520
I don't think we should leave the world because some people think it's okay to torture children.

412
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:58,600
It's like, I'll go to winter words.

413
00:33:58,601 --> 00:33:59,360
I'll go to the body.

414
00:33:59,241 --> 00:34:01,921
Okay, you're both sort of half there.

415
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:09,840
You've bought too much of Yvonne's story, but you haven't bought all of it, which is good.

416
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:14,241
But there's something about, well, let's hold this.

417
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:21,521
Both of you are right, that there ought to be a way to go to other parts of the world, so to speak, and do good deeds in them.

418
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:29,520
And Yvonne is telling you something like, but there's no way to either you have to fix the world as a whole or reject the world as a whole.

419
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,281
Something like that is his version.

420
00:34:31,281 --> 00:34:33,201
And we have to see why that's wrong.

421
00:34:33,201 --> 00:34:33,840
Yeah.

422
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:46,880
Once you think about it as a person creating their own world, well, he's saying, and that's the work, and you guys are challenging it in interesting ways.

423
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,721
There's only one big world, and we're all in it.

424
00:34:50,721 --> 00:35:01,201
And since we can't make a world of our own, because we're really part of this world, and since we can't fix it, the only thing to do is to leave.

425
00:35:01,761 --> 00:35:05,201
And you're all questioning that, and rightly so.

426
00:35:05,201 --> 00:35:08,720
But you haven't questioned it at the most basic level.

427
00:35:08,721 --> 00:35:09,201
Yeah.

428
00:35:09,201 --> 00:35:15,201
Is it possible that he's fundamentally wrong that God created the world so that you don't have to be impossible?

429
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:26,400
Like, it's not that people, I think somewhere in there, you said that Russians are just immediately fond of doing things.

430
00:35:27,121 --> 00:35:33,040
Maybe that's not so much true, but that they haven't, God doesn'ten to create people like all of them.

431
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,360
Well, that's probably okay.

432
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,321
I mean, okay in the sense that it doesn't matter.

433
00:35:38,321 --> 00:35:39,680
I'll get you in a minute.

434
00:35:39,681 --> 00:35:40,000
Okay.

435
00:35:40,161 --> 00:35:47,641
It doesn't matter whether God created it that way or God created it good, but then people fell and became sinful and evil.

436
00:35:44,241 --> 00:35:50,840
It's now a sinful and evil person and a world.

437
00:35:51,081 --> 00:35:55,481
And it's a kind of attack on God, but you could cancel God out of it.

438
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:11,240
The way he sets it up is: are you going to be part of a system, if it's a play or a fraternity or a culture or a society or a town, whatever, but the biggest system that's bad, don't you have, isn't it your obligation to get out of it?

439
00:36:11,241 --> 00:36:14,280
I'm going to listen to two more questions and then I'll do it my way.

440
00:36:14,281 --> 00:36:14,520
Yeah.

441
00:36:15,321 --> 00:36:20,120
All those really bad things that can happen, if he doesn't say any of the good things that happen to the world.

442
00:36:20,121 --> 00:36:24,920
And you get the world as supposed to only these like bad people who drive to torture phone.

443
00:36:25,241 --> 00:36:28,121
Yeah, but his argument is it's it's bad.

444
00:36:28,121 --> 00:36:39,640
If there's a world from the point of view of the children, so to speak, if it's a world in which one child is tortured in order to make it the kind of world it is, that's already grounds for rejecting it.

445
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:47,880
It's got to be for him a world in which no innocent victims suffer, or it's a world that you shouldn't accept.

446
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,200
Yeah.

447
00:36:48,681 --> 00:36:51,880
During the first 30 years of his right, he's poor anything.

448
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,241
You got it.

449
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,920
I mean, that's where you have to start.

450
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:05,160
Not that the other people were wrong, but you're questioning the really fundamental thing that's wrong is that it's from where he's making the argument.

451
00:37:05,161 --> 00:37:18,921
It isn't the argument that's wrong, but it's the idea that he somehow is related to the world the way you're related to a play for which you bought a ticket or a fraternity that you've gone to their initiation party or something.

452
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,001
You're not related to the world that way.

453
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:36,961
You are born and raised in the world, and you're part of the world, and you can't step back and take a completely detached attitude as if you were free and independent of the world, and whether you want to choose it or not.

454
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:42,241
You are inextricably enmeshed in the world from the moment you were born.

455
00:37:42,801 --> 00:37:44,640
That's Dostoevsky's argument.

456
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:57,040
Let me put it this way: I mean, the interesting, brilliant move in this chapter is that you try to figure out what's wrong with the argument, and what's really wrong is the point of view from which the argument is being made.

457
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,161
Yeah.

458
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,200
Yes.

459
00:37:59,761 --> 00:38:03,040
It's from the point of view of the eternal and the infinite.

460
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:14,641
It's sort of from God's point of view or the philosopher's point of view, or to put it now and bring it down to earth more, but it's taking up the detached point of view instead of the involved point of view.

461
00:38:14,641 --> 00:38:25,360
So the whole argument is made from the point of view of a detached mind who is deciding whether it wants to be part of this, have this body and be in this world.

462
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,321
And the answer is supposed to be, but you're not in a detached mind.

463
00:38:28,321 --> 00:38:30,241
You're stuck with this body in this world.

464
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:33,040
So you better get a different argument.

465
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,201
And that's when the other people come in.

466
00:38:35,201 --> 00:38:38,721
You just started it a step earlier, which is good.

467
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,641
And Beatrice wants to say something.

468
00:38:40,641 --> 00:38:45,441
Okay, then let me catch up where we are, because you really have worked it out.

469
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,401
Let's see now, where are we?

470
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,800
Okay, what's wrong with Yvonne's argument?

471
00:38:51,681 --> 00:38:54,481
The answer is it's a philosophical argument.

472
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,961
It presumes that Yvonne is related to the world like a spectator at a play.

473
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,401
If the play is stupid or vulgar, you can just walk out.

474
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,121
But that's not how you are in the world.

475
00:39:05,121 --> 00:39:06,801
You are involved.

476
00:39:06,801 --> 00:39:10,801
He's not in a position to accept or reject it.

477
00:39:10,801 --> 00:39:12,960
He's not an innocent bystander.

478
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,801
He's not an eyewitness to the world.

479
00:39:14,081 --> 00:39:21,160
He's involved, and now comes an amazing next move, and he's guilty.

480
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,161
And moreover, and this is just a tour de force of Dostoevsky.

481
00:39:25,161 --> 00:39:27,961
You don't have to do it this way, but he's going to do it this way.

482
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,201
What if he turns out to be an example of child abuse?

483
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:34,601
That would be really amazing.

484
00:39:34,601 --> 00:39:45,001
But that would be the most dramatic form to show that he's part of the problem, that he can't step outside the problem, so to speak, and reject the world.

485
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:54,761
Well, how in the world would anybody think that Yvonne, impeccable Yvonne, is involved in the world by way of being guilty?

486
00:39:54,761 --> 00:39:57,000
Well, I'll tell you the story.

487
00:39:57,241 --> 00:40:00,681
It's so sort of sprinkled around subtly by Dostoevsky.

488
00:40:00,681 --> 00:40:01,880
It's just incredible.

489
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:07,721
But to begin with, why is Yvonne so worried about the suffering of these children?

490
00:40:07,721 --> 00:40:10,761
Is that just something out of nowhere?

491
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:16,041
Let me read you about the way he describes the suffering of the children.

492
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,641
I guess I didn't write it down.

493
00:40:19,641 --> 00:40:24,041
Every once in a while I find one of these places where I didn't get the copy from the old text.

494
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:29,321
There's a place where he says that the children suffer for their father's sins.

495
00:40:29,321 --> 00:40:30,680
Let's see if we can find it.

496
00:40:31,241 --> 00:40:32,281
Right around here.

497
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,161
That's one of the examples that he gives.

498
00:40:35,161 --> 00:40:36,441
Can you find it?

499
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:37,801
Skipped it.

500
00:40:38,601 --> 00:40:39,080
Too bad.

501
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,680
Oh, there they are.

502
00:40:41,081 --> 00:40:44,521
At the bottom, it's about the bottom of 268.

503
00:40:45,161 --> 00:40:47,961
Okay, at the bottom, about five lines from the bottom.

504
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,880
If they suffer horribly on earth, they must suffer for their father's sins.

505
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,160
They must be punished for their fathers who have eaten the apple.

506
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,840
But so forth and so forth.

507
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:01,120
The innocent must not suffer for another's sins, and especially not those innocents.

508
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:07,521
Are you beginning to see any relation between Yvonne's complaint and Yvonne's life?

509
00:41:08,721 --> 00:41:11,281
He thinks he suffered for his father's sins.

510
00:41:11,281 --> 00:41:14,640
He's identifying with these tortured children.

511
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:15,920
That's the first move.

512
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,281
That's why he's sort of making a case for them.

513
00:41:19,281 --> 00:41:20,880
I have to write in here.

514
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,521
Okay.

515
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:27,681
And that's why he's that's already shows that he's not a disinterested spectator.

516
00:41:27,681 --> 00:41:32,481
He doesn't just stand off nowhere and reject the world.

517
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:40,561
But on the basis of his unhappy suffering as a child, he is interested in this problem of child abuse.

518
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:46,080
And that already shows how deeply connected he is to how he raises the question.

519
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,000
No, I don't think he recognizes yet that he's in despair.

520
00:41:54,801 --> 00:41:55,601
He will.

521
00:41:55,601 --> 00:42:12,240
But no, right now, it's just showing you that he's motivated to have this problem by this childhood, which is just part of the argument that he's in, as she was saying, that he's in the world from the start, from being a little kid already.

522
00:42:12,241 --> 00:42:12,480
Yeah.

523
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:20,880
That has to be that he went when it happened when the answer that he raised.

524
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:22,480
I see.

525
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:30,481
Smerzyakov did some sinful thing you're saying, and Yvonne has his own parallel.

526
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,880
I don't think that's going to get us the way we want to get.

527
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,761
We'll get there, but by a different track.

528
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,040
You don't need Smerzyakov.

529
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,761
That's too clever by half, as I did.

530
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:46,040
You know, Smerchikov is like Yvonne, and therefore you can read things about Smerchakikov and the cats back to Yvonne.

531
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:46,680
You don't need it.

532
00:42:44,321 --> 00:42:50,840
Dostoevsky has spit up in a much more amazing way.

533
00:42:51,161 --> 00:42:57,401
And that's when you start to realize that Yvonne is, I won't tell you yet.

534
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:03,641
I'll just read you passages and see if you can see what Dostoevsky's smuggling in here now.

535
00:43:05,721 --> 00:43:11,641
I have to read one of these horror stories at the bottom of 272 because that really gives it away.

536
00:43:11,641 --> 00:43:16,440
He says, a well-educated, cultured man and his wife beat their child with a birch rod.

537
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:24,360
A girl of seven, notice she, I guess she's just below seven, you'd have to say, or maybe it's only at the end of when you're seven that you get over being innocent.

538
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,761
I have an account of it and so forth.

539
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,961
He likes the birch twigs because it stings more and he begins stinging his daughter.

540
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,001
Now look at this.

541
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:43,161
I know for a fact that there are people who at every blow are worked up to sensuality, to literal sensuality, which increases progressively at every blow they inflict.

542
00:43:43,161 --> 00:43:44,840
Now, that's ambiguous.

543
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:48,360
Does he know that because he's read about it?

544
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,081
Or does he know that there are such people?

545
00:43:51,081 --> 00:43:53,721
I think that's all you can conclude from that.

546
00:43:53,721 --> 00:43:59,721
But now, now Dostoevsky throws the punchline at you on 273.

547
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:03,080
And I have to sort of explain it, but first I'll just let's read it.

548
00:44:03,081 --> 00:44:10,761
He's going on now about a girl of five and how they badly treated her, and at the end of that paragraph, the crucial clue.

549
00:44:10,761 --> 00:44:20,121
In every man, of course, a demon lies hidden, the demon of rage, the demon of lustful heat, at the screams of the tortured victim.

550
00:44:20,121 --> 00:44:22,360
What is strange about that?

551
00:44:23,321 --> 00:44:26,441
He knows that in every man.

552
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:30,400
Yeah, he's got to have that in himself if he knows that in every man.

553
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:36,161
I don't know about you, but maybe I'm just fooling myself, but I do not think I enjoy the screams of tortured victims.

554
00:44:36,641 --> 00:44:42,960
I can't even see the country, no country for old men, because I know how violent it's going to be.

555
00:44:43,601 --> 00:44:45,040
I'm squeamish about it.

556
00:44:45,761 --> 00:44:57,360
But I don't know about you all, but I doubt if you all think that you feel the screams of the tortured victims.

557
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,161
But Yvonne knows that everybody does.

558
00:45:00,161 --> 00:45:02,401
That means he knows that he does.

559
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:10,561
And now you look back at his, why is he collecting these anecdotes that are, as he says, nice, you see, not fine, nice.

560
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,720
He's getting off on them.

561
00:45:13,201 --> 00:45:14,480
He's lusting over them.

562
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:20,161
He's got his form of sexual excitement.

563
00:45:20,161 --> 00:45:21,761
He is the problem.

564
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:23,760
I mean, he is a sadist, in fact.

565
00:45:23,761 --> 00:45:26,960
Now, it's too much to get it out of that one sentence.

566
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,760
But I'll show you, you can find it all over the book once you see it, that Yvonne is a sadist.

567
00:45:31,761 --> 00:45:32,080
Yeah.

568
00:45:32,641 --> 00:45:37,840
So into all this big person because he's trying to purify himself.

569
00:45:38,081 --> 00:45:38,880
No, no, no.

570
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,080
I think you've got it upside down.

571
00:45:40,081 --> 00:45:40,960
Put it this way.

572
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:56,161
It's because he's into these sorts of things that he feels in some level a kind of horror at himself, that aspect of himself, and at the world because of that.

573
00:45:56,161 --> 00:46:04,561
And in effect, he's going to sort of kill himself and stamp out this sadist child molester that he is.

574
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,721
But he's not very conscious of that.

575
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:14,761
He doesn't seem to see any connection between the fact that he's collecting these fine anecdotes and that he's part of the problem.

576
00:46:14,761 --> 00:46:17,480
He thinks that he's, you know, he can give back the ticket.

577
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,440
He's not a sadist.

578
00:46:14,161 --> 00:46:20,121
There are all these bad people in the world.

579
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:26,520
He's been asked to join this world, this fraternity, or this movie, or this play, and he's not going to join it.

580
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,121
He's too impeccable.

581
00:46:28,121 --> 00:46:31,321
So he's really sort of lying to himself.

582
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:35,160
It's just that it comes out indirectly that he admits that in every man.

583
00:46:35,161 --> 00:46:37,801
I mean, Dostoevsky has done it just brilliantly.

584
00:46:37,801 --> 00:46:49,880
He's got Yvonne telling you that he's lusting at the screens of the tortured victims without realizing that he's telling you something special about himself.

585
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,721
He thinks he's just telling you a general characteristic of human beings.

586
00:46:53,721 --> 00:46:57,400
But the main thing is he's giving away what?

587
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,961
That he's not impeccable, that he hasn't got a ticket that he can give back.

588
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:05,641
He is the problem of torturing children.

589
00:47:05,641 --> 00:47:08,201
And that is just interesting.

590
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:18,840
And now, if you think that I made this up, you've got to, there's something that happens way late in the book, but it doesn't affect the plot, so I can tell you.

591
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:29,161
And it's just funny, if you can call it funny, that it's amazing that finally we find the whole story.

592
00:47:29,161 --> 00:47:35,801
And remember that I left you with the puzzle, really, of how Lisa is the existential double of Yvonne.

593
00:47:36,121 --> 00:47:42,520
Now we've discovered that maybe, let's just say maybe, did I say, yeah, oh, of Alyasha?

594
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,281
Ooh, thank you.

595
00:47:45,081 --> 00:47:46,280
You're looking worried.

596
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:48,120
Okay, now let me think a minute.

597
00:47:49,161 --> 00:47:51,400
Yes, I have not the right to say that.

598
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,481
You'll see why I mixed it up, because Yvonne is relevant here.

599
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:01,120
But the question remains, and I shouldn't have brought it in, how Alyasha is related to Lisa.

600
00:48:01,201 --> 00:48:06,720
The question we want to talk about right now is how Yvonne is related to Lisa.

601
00:48:06,721 --> 00:48:08,080
And that's the clue.

602
00:48:08,081 --> 00:48:11,041
So let me read it on 265.

603
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:27,521
He says, Now Lisa's talking, you know, when I read about that child, and it was a child which they crucified, and then they sat and ate pineapple jam while the child suffered for hours and finally died.

604
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,441
They hammered nails into him, the usual horror story.

605
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,241
And then she says, I cried all night.

606
00:48:34,241 --> 00:48:36,880
I kept thinking of how the little thing cried and moaned.

607
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,961
A child of four understands, you know.

608
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,760
And all the while the thought of pineapple jam haunted me.

609
00:48:41,761 --> 00:48:46,961
In the morning, I wrote a letter to a certain person begging him to come and see me.

610
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:52,561
He came and I told him all about the child and the pineapple jam, all about it, all.

611
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,801
And he said that it was nice.

612
00:48:54,801 --> 00:48:57,360
And now, who did she invite?

613
00:48:57,681 --> 00:48:59,840
It turns out it was Yvonne.

614
00:49:00,721 --> 00:49:02,560
It's no secret that it was Yvonne.

615
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,520
On the next page, what?

616
00:49:06,641 --> 00:49:10,001
I was on 675.

617
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:20,721
On 676, he says, she never says it's Yvonne, but Alyasha knows it's Yvonne, and everybody knows it's Yvonne, if you're reading the book.

618
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,321
And what happens?

619
00:49:22,321 --> 00:49:26,161
Then, well, let's see if I can.

620
00:49:26,641 --> 00:49:28,001
It's all very interesting.

621
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,480
So Alyasha says, did you send him the letter?

622
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,121
Yes.

623
00:49:31,121 --> 00:49:33,040
Simply to ask about the child?

624
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:33,601
No.

625
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:39,681
But he came and I asked him about it, and he answered and laughed and got up and went away.

626
00:49:39,681 --> 00:49:42,560
That person behaved honorably, Alyasha murmured.

627
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:48,680
That means what she really wanted to be was tortured by Yvonne, that he saw that and he left.

628
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,840
And she says, and did he despise me?

629
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,281
Did he laugh at me?

630
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:56,441
No, Alyasha says, perhaps he believes in pineapple jam himself.

631
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,921
He's very ill now, Lisa.

632
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,641
Yes, he does believe it, said Lisa with flashing eyes.

633
00:50:01,641 --> 00:50:06,360
He doesn't despise anyone, Alyasha went on, only he doesn't believe and so forth.

634
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,840
He doesn't believe in people, of course.

635
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,441
He does despise them.

636
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:14,441
Then he does despise me, me, you too.

637
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,241
Good.

638
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:19,000
She says, when he went out laughing, I felt that it was nice to be despised.

639
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,001
The child with fingers cut off is nice, and to be despised is nice.

640
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:36,441
Well, she's a raving masochist, and she knows that the one person she can call who will despise her and perhaps rape her, we just don't know what, but generally beat her up, whatever.

641
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:40,121
And Yvonne comes and at least does come and despise her.

642
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:50,521
And she, and so now we know that she knows, and Alyasha knows, that Yvonne is a saddest, and she's a masochist.

643
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:54,680
And then it just can't resist.

644
00:50:54,681 --> 00:50:56,360
It's like the cats in a way.

645
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,961
More weird, dusty, susty stuff happens on 67.

646
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:09,401
As soon as Alyasha had gone, this is the last paragraph, Lisa unbolted the door, opened it a little, put her finger in the crack, and slammed the door with all her might on her, pinching her finger.

647
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,561
I hope more than pinching, if the Russian probably ought to say squashing.

648
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:17,880
Ten seconds later, releasing her finger, she walked slowly to her chair.

649
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:23,000
She sat up straight in it and looked intensely at the blackened finger and at the blood oozing out under the nail.

650
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,360
Her lips were quivering, and she kept whispering to herself, I am a wretch, wretch, wretch, wretch.

651
00:51:28,681 --> 00:51:30,561
So she wants to be punished.

652
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:37,041
I mean, if just they're both in this suffering mode, but they're both in the wrong sort of suffering mode.

653
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:48,801
He's the saddest, sort of getting thinking it's fine and getting his kicks out of reading about tortured children, and she's a tortured child, torturing herself.

654
00:51:48,801 --> 00:52:03,441
And then you know that, so Yvonne, in spite of his claim to be pure and lofty and noble, is really got a base side, as base or baser even, than most people.

655
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:11,681
He's just too refined to actually torture anyone or to beat up Lisa, or right now too refined even to kill himself.

656
00:52:11,681 --> 00:52:15,601
But he has his nice collection of newspaper clippings.

657
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:20,641
And here's another little variation on it.

658
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:29,121
Thart has a view about what it is to be a saddest, and it doesn't mean actually beating up people and torturing them.

659
00:52:29,121 --> 00:52:42,721
Just treating people as objects in which you were the observer and free, and they are the object turned into an object by you is a kind of very refined sadistic attitude.

660
00:52:42,721 --> 00:52:45,520
How many know no exit where that comes in?

661
00:52:45,681 --> 00:52:48,561
You recognize the no exit story.

662
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:58,321
So Thart says that just the desire to be a free and vulnerable detached observer is sadistic.

663
00:52:58,321 --> 00:53:10,880
And that means, of course, that not only does Yvonne have his nice collection of newspaper clippings, but he has his job writing for the newspaper as the eyewitness, the detached observer.

664
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:19,721
So, at all the levels, from really sort of dirty sadism to kind of very refined sadism, he's a sadist.

665
00:53:20,681 --> 00:53:28,281
Later, you'll find Yvonne asking about the tortures in hell with great eagerness and interest.

666
00:53:28,281 --> 00:53:33,480
Because in the end, I guess every sadist must be a masochist, and the masochist must be a sadist somehow.

667
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,481
I don't really know how to work it out.

668
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:44,681
So, Yvonne is really interested in the punishments that people get, and of course, interested in the punishments that the children get.

669
00:53:44,681 --> 00:53:45,880
So, now what?

670
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:56,921
We're almost there, because it now turns out that the way the book works, it shows you that you aren't in the position to give back the ticket.

671
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:14,840
Yvonne, the sadist, who is relishing the torturing of these children, can't be giving back the ticket to the world saying, I don't want to be in a world in which people torture children, because he's totally hooked on the world in which people torture children.

672
00:54:15,721 --> 00:54:44,601
So, now the conclusion is his whole argument is wrong, because it looks like his relation to the world is like to a fraternity or a movie or a play, but not because they're just local and there's more to the world, but because he thinks you can just leave the world, the way you can leave the fraternity or the play where you're not responsible for what is vulgar and sadistic and stupid and prejudiced that might be going on there.

673
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:50,281
It's clear that he is doing just the kind of thing that he wants to condemn.

674
00:54:51,081 --> 00:55:00,160
So, he can't, as the righteous person, leave the world condemning the suffering of the children when he really enjoys the suffering of children.

675
00:54:59,241 --> 00:55:03,040
That's Dostoevsky's argument.

676
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:20,880
So now, I can't tell you much more about this because it's a plot thing, but I'll tell you a little: that Yvonne gets more and more general, and it turns out that being an eyewitness is a very dangerous thing to be.

677
00:55:21,201 --> 00:55:28,481
And it turns out that Yvonne takes responsibility for much of the evil in the book, finally.

678
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:33,040
And it turns out, too, that I was reading the notes for the brothers Karamatsov.

679
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:40,161
Dostoevsky calls Yvonne the educated one before he has a name for him and the murderer.

680
00:55:40,161 --> 00:55:45,600
And that's to remember that the guy, the one who wants to play the angel, plays the beast.

681
00:55:45,601 --> 00:55:49,280
It's all part of the same dark story.

682
00:55:49,601 --> 00:55:52,161
So, what's the right thing to think?

683
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,281
Well, first, Yvonne is not a spectator.

684
00:55:55,281 --> 00:55:56,400
He's not an eyewitness.

685
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,520
He's a participant.

686
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,720
He's part of the problem.

687
00:55:58,721 --> 00:56:00,321
He is guilty.

688
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,241
And now the question is, and so we can't give back the ticket.

689
00:56:04,241 --> 00:56:11,360
So now comes the people over in this corner who asked and already had good ideas about what to do.

690
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,160
There are two things.

691
00:56:12,161 --> 00:56:15,601
I mean, one is to discover Yvonne's argument is wrong.

692
00:56:15,601 --> 00:56:27,040
And the other one is to worry about, well, what are you supposed to do when you're enmeshed in a world in which there is evil in suffering innocent children, even if you're not sadistic?

693
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,360
That's just Yvonne's problem.

694
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:33,601
What are you supposed to do about living in that sort of world?

695
00:56:33,601 --> 00:56:41,920
So now we go to the person who has the most extreme opposite view of Yvonne from Yvonne's.

696
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,200
Do you recognize that?

697
00:56:43,201 --> 00:56:44,321
Have you got far enough?

698
00:56:44,681 --> 00:56:45,800
I don't know.

699
00:56:47,161 --> 00:56:52,441
Who worries about the guilt of, who worries about being guilty for all the suffering?

700
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:57,481
Well, maybe you haven't got to 184, though you should be getting there quickly.

701
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,920
But it's Zosima.

702
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:02,600
Zosima is the absolute opposite of Yvonne's story.

703
00:57:02,601 --> 00:57:15,561
Instead of claiming, like Yvonne, that he has no guilt, that he rejects the world because everybody else is guilty, Father Zosima claims that he's guilty for all the evil in the world.

704
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,081
184.

705
00:57:17,641 --> 00:57:18,201
You should be...

706
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,000
How far?

707
00:57:19,161 --> 00:57:20,520
Yes, you should be there.

708
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,200
So let's look at it.

709
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,801
184.

710
00:57:23,801 --> 00:57:33,321
Zosima's making this big speech about guilt at the second sentence or third sentence of the second paragraph, 184.

711
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:39,400
Because we have come here and shut ourselves within these walls, we are no holier than those that are outside.

712
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:48,521
On the contrary, for the very fact of coming here, each of us has confessed to himself that he is worse than others, worse than all the men on earth.

713
00:57:48,520 --> 00:58:01,880
And skipping a little, when he realizes that he's not only worse than others, but he's responsible to all men for all and everything, for all human sins, national and individual, only then can the aim of our seclusion be attained.

714
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:14,840
For know, dear ones, that every one of us is undoubtedly responsible for all men and everything on earth, not merely through the general sinfulness of creation, but each one personally for all mankind and every individual man.

715
00:58:15,161 --> 00:58:17,880
Now, that's a very strange speech.

716
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:25,560
Took me a long time to sort of free myself from it because the critics all say, isn't that interesting?

717
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:26,200
Wonderful.

718
00:58:26,201 --> 00:58:28,520
What an amazing character Father Zosima is.

719
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,960
He feels responsible for all the evil in the world.

720
00:58:31,121 --> 00:58:37,281
We're guilty for it individually and personally, for all of it everywhere.

721
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:39,441
But that's just crazy.

722
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:43,360
I mean, you can't, and I can't, feel guilty for the...

723
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:53,920
the thirsty people in the desert or the, I don't know, some Chinese family that's malfunctioning and so forth.

724
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:58,481
We can't even feel guilty for all the families in Berkeley that are malfunctioning.

725
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,281
I mean, it's just impossible to do that.

726
00:59:01,281 --> 00:59:10,641
And this story that Zosima's telling, which he's telling so well and so moving, and he's such a nice man, you wonder, what does Dostoevsky think about that?

727
00:59:10,641 --> 00:59:22,721
Well, Dostoevsky doesn't ever sort of say that he thinks this is a crazy view, but he shows you that that's not the right view.

728
00:59:22,721 --> 00:59:27,520
And that you get this crazy view if you withdraw into the monastery.

729
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,601
That is really what they're guilty of.

730
00:59:29,601 --> 00:59:32,801
Zosima says we're all guilty because we come here.

731
00:59:35,281 --> 00:59:43,281
But when they come there and withdraw from the world, they can't really deal with all the evil in the world.

732
00:59:43,761 --> 00:59:54,321
Their guilt is that they can feel guilty about everything, but it doesn't make any sense because they're not really guilty in any sensible way.

733
00:59:54,321 --> 00:59:57,840
And if they're staying in the monastery, they can't do anything about it.

734
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:04,560
So I think we're supposed to think that that is equally wrong.

735
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:10,561
It's as wrong as Yvonne thinking that you should get out of the world and give back your ticket.

736
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:16,200
There's a way in which Zosima gets out of the world and goes into the monastery, which is wrong.

737
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:23,401
Yvonne does it being very righteous, saying, you know, any decent person should get out of the world and I'm leaving.

738
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,720
Zosima has an opposite view.

739
01:00:25,721 --> 01:00:33,321
He gets out of the world and feels very guilty for doing it and guilty for all the evil in the world, but he doesn't do anything about it.

740
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:38,681
That's what you all see, is that can't be the right attitude.

741
01:00:38,681 --> 01:00:54,840
He assumes responsibility for all the evil in the world, but and he wants, he feels that he's, he doesn't ask how he can forgive all the bad people.

742
01:00:54,840 --> 01:01:00,840
He asks, who could forgive all those bad people, Yvonne asks at one point.

743
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:03,241
He asks everybody to forgive him.

744
01:01:03,241 --> 01:01:06,441
But it's all in this everybody stuff.

745
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,201
It's not neighbors.

746
01:01:08,201 --> 01:01:12,281
It's not the actual people who have actual problems.

747
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:17,880
He does sort of treat people who come to the monastery like a kind of therapist.

748
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,321
He does something.

749
01:01:19,321 --> 01:01:28,040
But he certainly doesn't deal with or have any sort of sensible relation to all the suffering in the world.

750
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:34,121
Just to say that he feels guilty of it, he wants the whole world to forgive him, just isn't going to get anywhere.

751
01:01:34,121 --> 01:01:35,560
So let me see now.

752
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:41,640
So on 261, I say that he's got just the opposite of Yvonne's view.

753
01:01:41,641 --> 01:01:43,801
Let's see what his view is on 261.

754
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,080
Ah, yeah, oh, yeah.

755
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:53,640
On 261, he says, when talking about Dimitri, Am I my brother's keeper?

756
01:01:53,641 --> 01:01:55,721
Yvonne asks irritably.

757
01:01:55,721 --> 01:02:00,721
Well, you see, in a way, Zosima thinks that he's everybody's keeper.

758
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Everybody's his brother.

759
01:02:02,321 --> 01:02:08,321
And that's just unrealistic and has no, isn't a way you can sensibly live.

760
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:16,880
And it turns out that, of course, Yvonne says, just what you expect him to say, that he's nobody's keeper.

761
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,880
He doesn't feel responsible for anything.

762
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,241
He's going to leave.

763
01:02:20,241 --> 01:02:22,241
He's not involved.

764
01:02:22,241 --> 01:02:35,040
And the funny thing is, you begin to see Smerzhyakov as a copy of Yvonne on 255 when talking about Dmitri about two-thirds down, Smerdhyakov says, how should I know about Dmitry?

765
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:39,120
I'm not his keeper, answered Smerdyakov, so forth.

766
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:47,041
So again, Smerzhikov is copying Yvonne, and they're taking this, we're not responsible for any of the evil in the world story.

767
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,681
And Zosima is taking the opposite view.

768
01:02:49,681 --> 01:02:53,840
I'm responsible, me, Zosima, for all the evil in the world.

769
01:02:54,161 --> 01:03:04,001
And I think the answer is supposed to be that Zosima's wrong view comes from stepping out of the world.

770
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:11,041
It's not the suicide kind of giving up, but he sort of gives back his ticket when he goes into the monastery.

771
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:15,601
And so that he isn't in any particular situation.

772
01:03:16,321 --> 01:03:20,000
It's not a case of philosophical detachment like Yvonne.

773
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,641
It's sort of monastery detachment.

774
01:03:22,641 --> 01:03:30,160
But they both detach themselves from the everyday, evolved, real world.

775
01:03:30,641 --> 01:03:37,601
And that's, and then either they take total responsibility or no responsibility.

776
01:03:37,601 --> 01:03:42,080
And either view is untenable.

777
01:03:42,081 --> 01:03:45,880
So philosophy, for monks turn out to be almost as bad as philosophers.

778
01:03:44,081 --> 01:03:56,040
I say almost because Zosima does treat people who come to the monastery for help, but that's he's got a tiny bit of involvement.

779
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:56,360
Yeah.

780
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,441
The problem would be why Sosima enters the monastery?

781
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,840
He does it because he realizes that he's still.

782
01:04:03,161 --> 01:04:06,520
Well, the trouble is he's happy to believe that he's guilty about everything.

783
01:04:07,161 --> 01:04:12,520
His mistake is, okay, he enters the monastery because he realizes he's guilty.

784
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:13,160
I see what you mean.

785
01:04:13,161 --> 01:04:14,280
Yvonne does.

786
01:04:16,281 --> 01:04:28,281
But the trouble is, his way of realizing that he's guilty is so general that it's hardly like, you know, he's not, it's like loving your neighbor, but no particular person.

787
01:04:28,761 --> 01:04:31,880
He feels guilty about all the evil, but no particular evil.

788
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:42,360
And that's, in the real world, there are really people who are evil, and they are really involved, and they have to realize it and do something about it.

789
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:48,040
And Zosima, of course, has an evil past or a bad past.

790
01:04:48,281 --> 01:04:51,321
But I'm going to talk about that right now.

791
01:04:53,161 --> 01:05:11,241
But the crucial thing is, if you ask me, how do I know that Dostoevsky thinks that it's because Zosima is in the monastery, that he's withdrawn from the world, that that's why he has this wrong, weird, useless view about being guilty of all evils.

792
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:19,561
If you take him literally, it's just crazy that he's personally responsible for every bad thing that happens, and he has to be forgiven for it.

793
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:29,761
I mean, to say one thing, the evidence that this is a wrong way of life that comes from being in the monastery comes early on, on 84.

794
01:05:29,761 --> 01:05:30,560
I can't believe it.

795
01:05:28,681 --> 01:05:33,761
No, let's look and see why I said 84.

796
01:05:34,081 --> 01:05:35,520
Yeah, it's that early.

797
01:05:29,161 --> 01:05:36,321
So you all know.

798
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,321
What does Osama say to Alyasha about the monastery?

799
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,080
He has to leave.

800
01:05:42,081 --> 01:05:45,360
That's what it says at the bottom of the middle of 84.

801
01:05:45,681 --> 01:05:50,080
When it's God's will to call me, leave the monastery, go away for good.

802
01:05:50,081 --> 01:05:53,600
See, the monastery is not a place he could even come back to in his old age.

803
01:05:53,601 --> 01:05:55,121
It's just wrong.

804
01:05:56,321 --> 01:05:58,400
So Alyasha started.

805
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,040
What is it?

806
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,520
This is not the place, your place for the time.

807
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:04,160
I bless you for great service in the world.

808
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,641
You will have to bear all.

809
01:06:07,281 --> 01:06:08,321
Christ be with you.

810
01:06:08,321 --> 01:06:12,481
What that means, we don't know yet, but Christ has to be existentialized, and he is.

811
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:13,440
Was he on my list?

812
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:13,920
I think it was.

813
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,161
Yeah, the incarnation is on the list.

814
01:06:16,161 --> 01:06:21,360
There is somebody in the book who is Christ in an existentialized form.

815
01:06:22,321 --> 01:06:24,081
You have to figure out where that is.

816
01:06:24,081 --> 01:06:26,400
So he says, Christ be with you.

817
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,480
Don't abandon him, and he will not abandon you.

818
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,001
You will see great sorrow, and in that sorrow you will be happy.

819
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,601
Remember my words.

820
01:06:33,601 --> 01:06:35,360
Okay, now, yes.

821
01:06:37,601 --> 01:06:38,241
Interesting.

822
01:06:38,241 --> 01:06:38,960
Interesting.

823
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:43,441
And I suppose, but I'm going to take up a different part of what you said.

824
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:49,121
Because the next thing that comes up is that Christ is the one who should take on all the sorrows of the world.

825
01:06:49,121 --> 01:06:49,920
Let's go there.

826
01:06:50,161 --> 01:06:52,321
That's exactly where we're supposed to be.

827
01:06:52,321 --> 01:06:55,761
You're amazingly tuned in.

828
01:06:55,761 --> 01:07:03,360
So Alyasha makes the move that he shouldn't make.

829
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:19,241
He's now been so upset and confused by Yvonne that he asks whether somebody shouldn't, so to speak, take on the guilt and be able to give forgiveness.

830
01:07:21,161 --> 01:07:24,360
But it can't be the people in the monastery.

831
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:26,520
And we can add that it would be blasphemous.

832
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:27,640
He doesn't say that here.

833
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:35,720
He's just asking, who has the right to forgive, who has suffered for all of this, and doesn't blame anybody.

834
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:40,920
And Yvonne asks, is there anyone who has the right to forgive everybody?

835
01:07:41,241 --> 01:07:46,440
And Alyasha makes the mistake of saying, yes, of course there is.

836
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:47,720
It's Jesus.

837
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:51,960
Because Dostoevsky, believe it or not, doesn't like that doctrine.

838
01:07:51,961 --> 01:07:55,800
The doctrine that Jesus can take on all the sins and forgive them.

839
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:56,920
Of course, you can see why.

840
01:07:56,921 --> 01:07:59,640
He would say, well, those babies are still suffering.

841
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:04,281
It's all very well for Jesus to be guiltless and suffer on the cross.

842
01:08:04,281 --> 01:08:11,161
And he may take on the guilt of original sin, but he certainly doesn't solve the problem of the children.

843
01:08:11,161 --> 01:08:13,960
So this is happening on 278.

844
01:08:14,281 --> 01:08:20,600
Dostoevsky's got his own views about how to take on suffering.

845
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:25,400
And you get them much later in the book, and they get existentialized.

846
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:28,520
But it isn't the Jesus figure who takes on the suffering.

847
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:29,880
He's got them separated.

848
01:08:29,881 --> 01:08:32,201
But I can't talk about that yet.

849
01:08:32,201 --> 01:08:34,360
But I can talk about 278.

850
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,560
Let's read it.

851
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:38,920
About rebellion and so forth.

852
01:08:38,921 --> 01:08:57,640
And here, this is where Alyasha sort of panics and says, well, remember, Yvonne says, can you accept the idea of living in a world with the unatoned blood of a little victim and accepting it would remain happy for you?

853
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:59,920
And you could accept it and remain happy?

854
01:08:59,081 --> 01:09:03,360
No, I can't admit it, said Alyasha suddenly with flashing eyes.

855
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:09,920
But Yvonne, you asked just now, is there a person in the world who has the right to forgive and can forgive?

856
01:09:09,921 --> 01:09:16,800
But there is a being, and he can forgive everything, all and for all, because he gave his innocent blood for all and everything.

857
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,480
See, that's right where he is.

858
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:21,760
You have forgotten him, and on him is built the edifice.

859
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,760
And it is to him that they cry aloud.

860
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:27,520
Thou art just, O Lord, and thy ways are revealed.

861
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:36,081
And now Yvonne has sort of set a trap for Alyasha because he says, Ah, the one without sin and his blood.

862
01:09:36,081 --> 01:09:37,520
No, I've not forgotten him.

863
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,120
On the contrary, I've been wondering how you didn't bring him up before.

864
01:09:41,121 --> 01:09:46,000
For usually, all arguments on your side put him in the foreground.

865
01:09:46,001 --> 01:09:47,840
You know, Alyasha, don't laugh.

866
01:09:47,841 --> 01:09:49,760
I wrote a poem about a year ago.

867
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:52,880
If you can waste another 10 minutes, I'll tell it to you.

868
01:09:52,881 --> 01:10:00,400
Well, that poem, which isn't a poem in rhyme, it's a kind of philosophical treatise.

869
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:01,840
Well, I don't know what it is.

870
01:10:02,161 --> 01:10:04,081
It's the Grand Inquisitor story, anyway.

871
01:10:04,081 --> 01:10:05,520
That's what he's talking about.

872
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,281
And it's funny, I never noticed it before.

873
01:10:07,281 --> 01:10:08,081
Give me 10 minutes.

874
01:10:08,081 --> 01:10:12,560
The Grand Inquisitor story takes hours, and it's very complicated.

875
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:28,880
But the way Dostoevsky segues to it is by way of the question of Jesus as the completely innocent Savior.

876
01:10:28,881 --> 01:10:31,440
Dostoevsky doesn't believe in innocent Saviors.

877
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,080
I will have to say more about that next time.

878
01:10:34,081 --> 01:10:36,161
But I've got a little bit of this time.

879
01:10:36,161 --> 01:10:38,560
So, anybody want to say anything more?

880
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:45,161
The Grand Inquisitor story is, I don't know how many have had the Grand Inquisitor story in school somewhere.

881
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:48,281
Sometimes people used to read it out of context.

882
01:10:44,081 --> 01:10:50,600
You just outside of the book.

883
01:10:50,921 --> 01:10:58,920
When you read it outside of the book, did it come out in the class that it was for Jesus or for the Grand Inquisitor or against both of them?

884
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:00,840
You don't remember.

885
01:11:00,841 --> 01:11:13,480
Well, most people, when they used to read it, when you read it all in isolation, it looks like, maybe, if you're not careful, that it's on the side of Jesus, not the Grand Inquisitor.

886
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:27,960
But if Yvonne is telling it, and then you know the context of it, and you know that he's going to, he's written this somehow to attack the perfect, the view of Jesus as perfect and as able to forgive everybody.

887
01:11:27,961 --> 01:11:30,281
So we have to see how that works.

888
01:11:30,281 --> 01:11:36,520
But in the meantime, I can prepare you for it because I don't want to waste a minute because we're running out of time all the time.

889
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:38,680
So let's see.

890
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:42,600
Okay, let me give you the background quick.

891
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:48,360
So you should, you can, before you get into the Grand Inquisitor story, you've got to know the structure of it.

892
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:52,680
The structure of it is what philosophers call an antinome.

893
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:54,680
I'll write that on the board next time.

894
01:11:54,680 --> 01:12:05,880
Antinome is when there are two positions, each of them wrong, and each of them sees how wrong the other one is and uses that as evidence that they're right.

895
01:12:05,881 --> 01:12:11,800
So that I'll give you an example, all this to get it out of the way, sort of, so we can plunge right in.

896
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:15,001
And antinomy, Kant has these antinomies.

897
01:12:14,961 --> 01:12:19,720
So I have to write antinomy on the board if I'm going to keep saying this new mysterious word.

898
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:20,680
Where is it?

899
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:22,121
Oh, yeah, A-N-T-I.

900
01:12:22,241 --> 01:12:23,800
I mean, the word never appears.

901
01:12:24,121 --> 01:12:28,440
It's a word Kant uses, but it's the structure of an antinome.

902
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:31,281
And the structure, let me give you a Kant antinomy first.

903
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:38,720
Suppose the antinomy is, is this time eternal, or is there a moment when time begins?

904
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:41,840
And you say, well, let's say the time is eternal.

905
01:12:41,841 --> 01:12:43,041
Yeah, but how could that be?

906
01:12:43,041 --> 01:12:47,120
Eternal sort of isn't an amount of time.

907
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:50,001
So, or let's try a different one.

908
01:12:50,001 --> 01:12:54,720
Are things infinitely divisible into tinier and tinier, or are there atoms?

909
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:59,920
And if you say, well, they're infinitely divisible, well, then you would get to something infinitely small.

910
01:12:59,921 --> 01:13:02,241
But how can you get to something infinitely small?

911
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:05,760
There is no, infinity isn't a size.

912
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,440
So maybe there must be atoms.

913
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:10,321
Yeah, but then if there are atoms, you could always chop them up more.

914
01:13:10,321 --> 01:13:11,920
So how could there be atoms?

915
01:13:11,921 --> 01:13:13,121
So you go back and forth.

916
01:13:13,921 --> 01:13:15,281
And now let's try it with time.

917
01:13:15,281 --> 01:13:18,241
So if time has a beginning, that doesn't feel right.

918
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:19,680
What would be there before?

919
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:20,960
And how could it start?

920
01:13:20,961 --> 01:13:24,241
Well, then maybe time goes on eternally, forever.

921
01:13:24,241 --> 01:13:27,201
But this sort of forever isn't an amount.

922
01:13:27,201 --> 01:13:28,640
So let me sum up.

923
01:13:29,281 --> 01:13:31,760
If you don't like my examples, forget them.

924
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:38,000
Because the point is, you'll see in the Grand Inquisitor two views, each of them wrong.

925
01:13:38,001 --> 01:13:42,480
Each of them arguing for their truth by showing how wrong the other is.

926
01:13:43,121 --> 01:13:49,360
And the only way to get out of an antinome is to prove that there's a third possibility.

927
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:53,201
So Pont says the whole world is only a matter of appearances.

928
01:13:53,201 --> 01:13:56,720
If you think that space and time are real, you get into these puzzles.

929
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:59,920
But if you think that they're all appearances, then you don't.

930
01:13:59,921 --> 01:14:02,161
So I won't tell you yet.

931
01:14:02,161 --> 01:14:05,520
I'll tell you next time what the third position is.

932
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:09,680
But let's at least one more minute settle what are the two positions.

933
01:14:10,961 --> 01:14:18,840
You recognize the Grand Inquisitor is, of course, the Roman Catholic Church, but in an extreme kind of caricature.

934
01:14:19,161 --> 01:14:21,400
What could be the other position?

935
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:25,241
Not the one that solves, not the third one, but the second position.

936
01:14:25,241 --> 01:14:27,480
What is Jesus' view?

937
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:47,560
Well, if you look at it, you discover that the Grand Inquisitor begins after there, just in 1500, around in the 1500s, where there has been, where's my, well, help me find the Grand Inquisitor quick, in a hurry, so I can read you the first few sentences.

938
01:14:47,961 --> 01:14:49,241
79.

939
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:50,840
279?

940
01:14:51,161 --> 01:14:53,161
Okay, 279.

941
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:59,241
So it starts out in the 16th century, in the 1500s, that is.

942
01:14:59,241 --> 01:15:03,000
In North Germany, there's been a terrible heresy.

943
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,081
That's a bottom 280.

944
01:15:05,081 --> 01:15:09,880
What is this heresy that takes place in North Germany at the end of the 1500s?

945
01:15:10,041 --> 01:15:13,080
Protestantism, exactly, the Reformation.

946
01:15:13,081 --> 01:15:17,400
So Jesus is the Protestant, and it's like Kierkegaard.

947
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:19,241
It's extremely like Kierkegaard.

948
01:15:19,241 --> 01:15:20,520
Dostoevsky is such a genius.

949
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:24,520
I'll read you passages from Kierkegaard that Jostovsky invented Kierkegaard.

950
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:33,640
And so it's the Catholic, Greek-influenced church against sort of the super-existentialist Protestant view.

951
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:42,281
And then you have to figure out what is the third view, because those two views are each so extreme that they shoot each other down.

952
01:15:42,281 --> 01:15:44,360
But anyway, we will do all that in detail.

953
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:47,400
And you read the Grand Inquisitor over the weekend.
