1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
But now I'm just going to start and talk about the movie.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:17,120
And the one more thing I want to say, you should know Graham Green is a religious Catholic, and it's a deeply Christian book, though he says in his introduction, he thought it was an entertainment and just a light entertainment.

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:26,319
That's why they thought she should put her arm through her hand through on his arm, because that's how light entertainments are supposed to end.

4
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:32,920
But author is right out of understanding that they have, even if they don't know they have it, and even if they don't know they're expressing it.

5
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,920
And this is a deeply, brilliantly Christian book.

6
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:43,959
And Graham Green was expressing something that he undoubtedly felt, even though he didn't know he was.

7
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:51,720
So now we're going to just talk about it until at the end of today we get back to the scene and why at the end and why it's so important.

8
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:55,160
But to start with, you get the entertainment side of it.

9
00:00:55,159 --> 00:01:07,560
It's a very funny book in that there are all kinds of reversals in it, which are funny and sad and surprising and scary.

10
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:14,839
And I'm just going to remind you of them because the movie is structured around reversals like this.

11
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:22,839
Well, to begin with, of course, Holly arrives in Vienna to find that his friend Harry is dead.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,760
That's a big surprise and reversal.

13
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,280
Then it turns out he isn't dead, which is another surprise and reversal.

14
00:01:28,279 --> 00:01:29,639
He's the third man.

15
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:31,480
And then in the end, Holly kills him.

16
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,319
That's pretty surprising, too.

17
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:47,320
A more perfect example of the entertainment is the kidnapping in the taxi, where it looks like he's been taken away from the hotel by this cab driver who's driving like a maniac and who won't speak to him.

18
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,200
And everybody is just having to get out of the way of the taxi.

19
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:57,880
And it looks like he's, and he looks like he's going to be in some sinister, taken to some sinister castle where they might torture him or even kill him.

20
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:09,160
And then, and he tries to escape when he, when the cab door is open, but the cab door gets in the way, and then the door to this sinister-looking place out in the country opens.

21
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:09,880
And what is it?

22
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:15,600
It's the meeting of the literary society that he's promised to talk to in order to get money to stay in Vienna.

23
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:23,920
And the reversal is that they torture him with questions about James Joyce and the crisis of faith, that he looks absolutely miserable.

24
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,360
And then these thugs arrive and try to kill him.

25
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,040
So that's what it looked like it was going to be all along.

26
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:37,520
So another one, remember the shadow that comes around the corner when they're waiting for Harry Lyme?

27
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,480
It's an amazing thing, this big shadow.

28
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:47,200
But then the shadow turns out to be a balloon man, but then the balloon man, the camera dwells and dwells on the balloon man.

29
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,120
So you think, well, there must be something special.

30
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,120
Maybe it's Orson Welles that is Harry Lyme in disguise.

31
00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:00,720
And then it turns out he really is a balloon man, and he sells a balloon to Payne, has to buy the balloon to get him to go away.

32
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:20,560
So that, and then, at the last reversal, I told you first, it looks like they're going to get together, and then at the last, and she gets closer and closer to him, and then it turns out she doesn't, she walks right by him.

33
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:33,919
And as we'll go back to this, he lights a cigarette and throws it away with a gesture, the same gesture that he used earlier to express sort of total incomprehension.

34
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:43,200
And if they had walked off in the sunset together, the whole movie would have made absolutely no sense.

35
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,640
But the way it ends is exactly how it has to end.

36
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,880
And now I'm going to try to convince you that.

37
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,959
Oh, look what I found.

38
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:56,480
It's just as well to tell you here that this is what it was going to end like.

39
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,880
He caught up with her and they walked side by side.

40
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:01,640
I don't think he said a word to her.

41
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,240
This is Calloway narrating.

42
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:10,040
It was like the end of a story, except that before they turned out of my sight, her hand was through his arm.

43
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:12,840
And that they disagreed about that.

44
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,440
And I already told you this disagreement, which I won't read, but this much.

45
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:27,240
Graham Green thought that an entertainment of this kind was too light an affair to carry the weight of an unhappy ending.

46
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,200
And Carol Reed, the director, thought it would strike audiences as unpleasantly cynical.

47
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,920
And so they decided to not have it happen that way.

48
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:39,320
And then you see what happens.

49
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,759
So I'm going to try to convince you.

50
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:43,959
I don't think it's hard.

51
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,200
I think you can help.

52
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,880
I mean, you can give me more evidence or tell me I'm not convincing you.

53
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:56,039
I'm going to make the case that Hannah and Holly could never get together.

54
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,120
They are diametrical opposites.

55
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:08,200
It's even wrong, really, to say that they're opposites, because opposites have to be in the same dimension at different ends of the dimension.

56
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:15,000
You get to see real opposites in your next movie when you see Breathless at different ends of a dimension.

57
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,160
But this is really even more extreme.

58
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:19,000
They're in different worlds.

59
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:26,519
They are, we'll have to explain bit by bit what worlds they're in.

60
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:32,440
But they are in incommensurate spheres of existence, to call it therapy guard chart.

61
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:42,519
They're just two different ways of understanding what a human being are and what human beings should do and what the world is there for and so forth.

62
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:52,880
And so the question then is: if you're just seeing the movie, you want to know at the end, well, why does she just walk past him?

63
00:05:52,880 --> 00:06:16,960
And to find out, we've got to talk about all of the four main characters: Holly Martens, Harry Lynn, and Anna and Calloway, and what sphere of existence they are each in, and why they can't possibly even communicate or understand each other.

64
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,120
Okay, let's start with Holly.

65
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:39,280
Holly is, in a certain way, maybe another reversal now that I think of it, because in a cafe, Anna says to him with disgust, honest, sensible, sober, harmless Holly Martins.

66
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:50,560
And in fact, he does tell the truth, and he is most of the time sober, and certainly sensible and boring.

67
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:59,279
Even the cat just yawns, remember, when he tries to play with the cat and runs off to play with Harry who's waiting under the window.

68
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:08,240
And there's one place where he says, I could stand on my head and make funny faces at you between my legs, and she looks like such a pained expression.

69
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,759
But that's the best he can do.

70
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,600
But the interesting thing is, is he harmless?

71
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:32,839
And you ask yourself the question: given the deaths in the movie, who's responsible for the kid, the kids that die outside the movie, we know Harry Lyme has killed lots of them.

72
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:36,439
But there are three, well, let's go, three people who get killed in the movie.

73
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,400
Who are they?

74
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,480
Harry Lyme gets killed.

75
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,560
The porter gets killed.

76
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:42,840
Who else?

77
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:45,399
I can't think of the other one myself.

78
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:47,560
Oh, Payne.

79
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:49,240
Yes, Payne gets killed.

80
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,400
Now ask yourself, who's responsible for all those deaths?

81
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,120
Well, who killed the porter?

82
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:59,639
Well, Harry killed the porter, really.

83
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,279
That's why you have this weird look on the porter's face.

84
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:09,400
I had to see the movie a few times before I realized that the porter wasn't looking just good grief, somebody's coming to kill me.

85
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:12,759
You see that scene of him just before he did.

86
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,720
He's thinking, I'm seeing a ghost, because he believes that Harry Lyme is dead.

87
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,639
But anyway, Harry Lyme kills the porter, but who's responsible for that murder?

88
00:08:21,799 --> 00:08:30,600
Yes, Holly, for talking to Kurtz or whoever it was and saying, you know, the porter has seen that there was a third man.

89
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:43,800
And the proof that Holly is the murderer, do you remember what the little, I think maybe it's only in German, the little kids going around saying something while they're wh while when the police are there.

90
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,360
Is it in German or is it in English?

91
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,240
The little kid is saying, he's the murderer, he's the murderer, and pointing it at at Holly.

92
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:56,840
And in Graham Greene movies in general, little kids know what's going on, really know.

93
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,080
Oh, anyway, so so there he's responsible for the death of a porter.

94
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:14,159
He's responsible for the death of Payne because Payne runs out to try to protect Holly, who's stupidly run out with in the into the sewer without any taking any cover.

95
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:16,159
And for now, I've lost the last.

96
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:23,360
Oh, and of course, Holly kills Harry, Feynman, Harry's with Harry's permission.

97
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,720
But anyway, he's not harmless.

98
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:38,240
And even his kind of honesty is dangerous because it's because he tells these bad guys all the time when they ask sort of what he knows and what's going on that he gets everybody else into trouble.

99
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,240
So he's relatively easy to talk about.

100
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,639
So let's go on to Harry.

101
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,000
Harry's much more interesting and complicated.

102
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,560
Harry is just the opposite of Holly in many, many ways.

103
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:57,280
In fact, you could write them on the board.

104
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:02,880
I'm going to give you this chart at the end, but I don't want you to have it now because it will just get you ahead of the story.

105
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,440
And it's important to follow it step by step.

106
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:12,880
So there is something here which is Harry, and over here is Holly.

107
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,560
And what are we going to find out?

108
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:24,000
Well, we found out already that over here is harmless, which is really dangerous.

109
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:28,639
Well, I don't want to write more on it right now.

110
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,560
Over here, he's funny, entertaining.

111
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,399
Everything is such fun with him.

112
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:38,159
He's dangerous too, in a different way.

113
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:42,639
And, okay, I'll write the next when we get there.

114
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:44,319
Let's go back to where we are.

115
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,120
Okay.

116
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,760
He is ruthless.

117
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,799
Absolutely ruthless, selfish.

118
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,639
He, he meaning Harry Lynn.

119
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,159
Ruthless and selfish as you can get.

120
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:06,040
The clearest thing is he's ready to kill his best friend if he to save his own skin.

121
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:15,559
That happens in the Ferris wheel, remember how it goes, how he's very glad to see Holly, and it looks like Holly's the only one.

122
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:24,919
Then he discovers that Holly knows that he, obviously Holly knows that he's alive, and he discovers that Holly's the only one who knows that he's alive.

123
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:27,399
Then this not so subtle thing happens.

124
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:30,120
I think this movie is a lot easier to follow than Hiroshima.

125
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:33,320
Then immediately he threatens to shoot him.

126
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:38,360
He says, well, nobody will find the bullet when your body hits the ground down there.

127
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:51,159
And he's just ready to shoot him when Harry, who's, I'm sorry, when Holly's, who's sort of smart about, says to him immediately, I've told Calloway and Anna.

128
00:11:51,159 --> 00:12:01,399
And then Harry switches immediately from this ruthless, selfish attitude back to being very affectionate and friendly and so forth.

129
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:09,399
And what you see in there is that, but it's more, I mean, it's, I've got to explain it better.

130
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,759
It isn't as if he doesn't really care about Holly.

131
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:21,720
In fact, he cares about Holly so much that he's ready to risk his life just to see Holly.

132
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:26,360
Remember, he says, I'll meet you in the international zone, but don't come with any police.

133
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,080
But it's taking a big risk to do that.

134
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,320
And in fact, it ends in getting Harry killed.

135
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:40,919
But even more interesting and strange, and I'm not even sure my view of this is right, what's he doing under Anna's window?

136
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:50,880
Well, I take it it's because he really loves her in his way and cares about her and misses her and wants to see her that he's out hanging around under her window.

137
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:55,920
And so what is his character?

138
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,279
What is his problem?

139
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:02,399
Well, his problem is only this, that he cares about himself more than anybody.

140
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,639
I think he loves her.

141
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:12,479
We know that he's written her very good love letters, good meaning she doesn't want anybody else to read them, intimate love letters.

142
00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:15,600
We know that he's hiding there in the doorway.

143
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:24,639
I think there's every reason to think that in a certain sense he loves her, but she is not his unconditional commitment.

144
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:31,040
He loves her that there's one person he loves more, namely him, Harry Lyme.

145
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,679
He's ready to sacrifice his best male friend and his girlfriend to save his own skin.

146
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:44,799
He is totally self-love, totally self-centered, like a child.

147
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,800
But nonetheless, he's not a child.

148
00:13:50,800 --> 00:14:02,479
He understands affection for his old buddy, and he understands something almost like as near love as you can get for Anna.

149
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:07,999
But as soon as his life is threatened, he'll betray and kill his closest friend and the woman he loves.

150
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:13,759
And that is, in a way, absolute evil in the Catholic perspective.

151
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:21,039
The people who are at the bottom of the inferno in Dante are people who have betrayed people they love.

152
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:29,559
The idea that they love themselves more than anybody is exactly the ultimate sin.

153
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,760
And it's not just lower immediacy.

154
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,680
Children don't get to the bottom of hell.

155
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:43,319
It's because they betray the people that they're intimate with and love that they get to the bottom of hell.

156
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:49,559
And he has actually, it goes by very fast, betrayed Anna, literally.

157
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:57,799
You know, how many realize that he turns her over to the Russians in order to be protected in the Russian zone?

158
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:06,759
It goes very fast, and presumably what they want from her is to understand how she got this passport, this illegal passport.

159
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:18,199
But it says, at one point, just as things are going, Martin, that Holly says, you informed on her.

160
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,120
Harry, with a smile, don't be a policeman, old man.

161
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:25,239
I didn't believe the police when they told me about you.

162
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:27,800
Were you going to cut me in on the spoils and so forth?

163
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,399
Anyway, he has just done the ultimate thing.

164
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:35,399
And I just realized how interesting he's really complicated.

165
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:38,920
Because what does he put on the window of the Paris wheel at the bottom?

166
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:44,120
Remember, in the sort of steamy window, he puts something when he's talking about Anna.

167
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:46,600
He puts a heart with an arrow through it.

168
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,799
And that's not irony.

169
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,120
That's a Valentine.

170
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:57,799
I mean, he is, he loves Anna, and he turns her over to the Russians to save his skin.

171
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,759
That's the kind of person he is.

172
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,679
And that's absolute selfishness.

173
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:09,319
And it leads to a kind of despair.

174
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:28,639
If you are a religious sort of person who understands love and betrayal then you are going to feel despair when you trump your love with your to save your skin and there is this fascinating conversation on page 112.

175
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:35,120
I give these pages not because I think you all have them, but some of you will be writing on this and want to know where I said these things.

176
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:41,039
So he says, Martin says to him, you used to believe in God.

177
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,799
A shade of melancholy crosses Harry's face.

178
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,840
Oh, I still believe, old man, in God and mercy and all that.

179
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:53,280
And then he says something which isn't in the script.

180
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,199
Orson Welles is just so amazing.

181
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,919
He says, and what do you believe in?

182
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:02,639
And the answer is, of course, that Holly doesn't believe in anything.

183
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,479
We'll go back to that.

184
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:06,399
In fact, we could go to that right now.

185
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:09,919
By the way, on 113, the script is wrong.

186
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:17,919
It says in the film, there's a dialogue here where Martin's, that is, Holly, says, what do you believe in?

187
00:17:18,239 --> 00:17:21,120
And that's not, of course, isn't what happens.

188
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,799
It's Harry who says to Holly, what do you believe in?

189
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,120
And it's that.

190
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:35,999
But all I want to stress now is that Harry is certainly in the religious dimension.

191
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,399
And we could put in some other things now.

192
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:43,120
He's betrayed the person he loves.

193
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:52,479
And he's got this kind of melancholy I just read about when asked about what he believes in.

194
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:56,319
I take it melancholy is some form of despair.

195
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:02,519
I mean, he knows that what he's doing is wrong, and he can't help doing it.

196
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:06,919
And Holly, do I want to add anything more?

197
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,120
Well, he also betrays his best friend.

198
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,880
How does he betray his best friend, just to keep the plot in mind?

199
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:27,159
He's the one who acts as the, quote, dumb decoy duck that gets Harry Lyme to show up in the international zone and thereby be captured.

200
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:30,679
Although it turns out he ends up being killed, that that wasn't part of the plan.

201
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:32,999
And he wants him to be captured.

202
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:41,880
But now the interesting thing is, both of these betrayers are in the negative form of something.

203
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,360
This is the negative religious.

204
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,880
And this is, I haven't explained this at all yet, the negative ethic.

205
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:59,559
All I'm saying right now is that the way they betray their loves, let's call them, their intimate other, is totally different.

206
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,319
And it begins to make you begin to realize how different they are.

207
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:11,560
So we see Harry Lyme betrays Anna out of selfishness.

208
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:19,959
And why does Holly betray Harry?

209
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,559
That is, why does he agree to turn Harry over to the police?

210
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:26,199
It isn't selfishness for sure.

211
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:27,880
Yeah, exactly.

212
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:30,679
Halloway shows him the children.

213
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:49,040
When he sees the children, he sees that it's right to turn over Harry because he's a murderer, even though it means hurting somebody he cares a whole lot about.

214
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,240
He still cares about him.

215
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:56,399
She says, Hannah says, Anna says to him, you loved him, I loved him, and now look what we've done for him.

216
00:19:56,399 --> 00:20:11,120
But anyway, so what is from the point of view that Holly has, this betrayal is not only okay, it's good, it's honorable.

217
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,960
It's like, what, Agamemnon killing Ephigenia?

218
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:38,319
That is a lower immediacy or a lower ethical, either way you want to put it, a feeling for Ephigenia or the duty of father, and here a feeling, a warm feeling for Harry or the duty of friend, trumps, sorry, gets trumped by a higher duty, namely turn in murderers.

219
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,560
And so he does it.

220
00:20:40,560 --> 00:21:00,639
So they do it for this, he does it for a bad reason, betrays his love out of sheer selfishness, love of himself, betrays his best friend out of a painful, tragic choice from his point of view, and rightly from his, that is, of having to subsume him under a higher ethical.

221
00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:02,079
Well, I think I've got enough there.

222
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,120
I can put that up there, yes.

223
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,479
We'll get more people in a minute.

224
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,919
So where are we now?

225
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:20,559
So in a way, Harry is in hell already in melancholy, in despair, and he's sort of at the bottom of the inferno, the nearest thing being the sewer.

226
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:28,239
Most of the time we see him at night, and by the end of the movie, most of the time we've seen him is in the sewer.

227
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:54,519
But there's an interesting thing that he's reaching up, obviously trying to escape, but it's as if he's also reaching up from the lower depths to, when you see his hands sort of groping out of the grating, I think you can't help seeing him sort of reaching for freedom but not being able to make it, and reaching for sort of God but not being able to make it.

228
00:21:54,520 --> 00:22:04,199
In the religious dimension, you're always, well, even sinners are possible saints and could be saved up to the last minute.

229
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:09,319
And even saints are possible sinners that could be saved up to the last minute.

230
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,799
It's a reversible dimension.

231
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:20,039
And he's sort of striving upward from the bottom of the sewer, from the bottom of hell, but of course he can't do it.

232
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:25,159
And he can't do it because, again, he's stuck on protecting himself.

233
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,719
And now I should say someplace, something about names.

234
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:32,199
So let me say something about names right now.

235
00:22:32,199 --> 00:22:43,080
I could have started with Holly, who has, well, for one thing, the book is sort of obsessed with names.

236
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,319
Everybody's concerned about their name.

237
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,439
Calloway doesn't like to be called Callahan.

238
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,159
Holly certainly doesn't like to be called Harry.

239
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:53,639
Dr.

240
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:55,479
Winkle doesn't like to be called Dr.

241
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:59,959
Winkle by people who don't know how to talk German.

242
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:04,759
And there's a place where Holly actually calls attention to his name.

243
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,360
Calloway says, be sensible, Martin.

244
00:23:08,439 --> 00:23:11,959
And Martin says, I haven't got a sensible name.

245
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:12,919
And that's true.

246
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:24,799
Whatever Holly is there, it was Rollo in a script, but I think they very cleverly turned it to Harry so that, to Holly, so that she could mix him up with Harry all the time.

247
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,360
But what do you think of when you think of Holly?

248
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,760
Is it a, I mean, anything come to mind?

249
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,279
There's no great, big secret here.

250
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,200
I'm just trying to give a feel for these various things.

251
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:39,280
Let's try the others because they're clearer.

252
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,360
Let's, well, Harry Lyme.

253
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,239
Oh, that's a crazy one, too, but I can't resist.

254
00:23:45,120 --> 00:24:01,120
A very smart student, perhaps too clever by half, I'm not sure, pointed out to me that this lime fits perfectly for Harry Lyme, particularly in the sewer scene, because there's a line from Hamlet.

255
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:08,239
Does anybody know Hamlet well enough to know the line, O limed soul that struggles to be free, art more engaged?

256
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:28,080
That's what Claudius, a big sinner who's killed off the king and so forth, is trying to pray, but he can't pray because he's too happy with his good fortune, having taken over the kingdom and taken over the guy's wife and so forth.

257
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:35,199
But lime is a sticky substance used to catch birds, and the more the bird struggles to be free, the more it's trapped.

258
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:37,840
Now, it does fit perfectly for Harry Lyme.

259
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:45,679
I just don't know whether to believe that that could have been going through the conscious or unconscious of Graham Greene or not.

260
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,679
But Talloway is an easy one.

261
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,880
I mean, what does Calloway make you think of?

262
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:52,799
Tallus, exactly.

263
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,600
Now, is he really Tallus?

264
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,039
Not at all.

265
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,439
But it looks callous, like when he takes the love letters.

266
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,399
He's just professional, as Payne says.

267
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:07,159
He says, we're like doctors.

268
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:14,919
We just have to do this job, but we don't really, we don't, you know, read the letters to hear your, to find out your private life.

269
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:28,840
So, but Calloway looks callous to Anna because in his doing his professional duty, he doesn't respect her letters or her life or her point of view at all.

270
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:30,759
We'll come back to that.

271
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,639
And Anna, I mean, it's easy to say that Anna is religious.

272
00:25:38,199 --> 00:25:45,399
She's capable of total love, complete devotion, will sacrifice herself for Harry if she could.

273
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:47,080
And she's named Anna.

274
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,439
Anna's a saint.

275
00:25:48,439 --> 00:25:50,919
Anna's, what, the mother of Mary, I think.

276
00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:52,439
Was that right?

277
00:25:53,239 --> 00:25:54,440
And Anne, St.

278
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,399
Anne.

279
00:25:55,719 --> 00:25:59,159
And so, and that name fits for her.

280
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:01,320
Now, Holly's guy is back to Holly.

281
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:08,919
The most I can say about Holly is that it sounds plastic, it sounds sort of like Hollywood.

282
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:15,880
Maybe again, the same very, very clever student says, Holly looks nice, but it's really poisonous.

283
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,159
That's true.

284
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,320
I don't know whether that's what was on their mind.

285
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,120
But anyway, all these names mean something.

286
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:24,519
But why am I saying this?

287
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:37,639
I guess I'm saying it just because I was saying that Harry is in a certain way already sort of in hell, striving to get out into the out and not being able to.

288
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,559
Let's see.

289
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,719
Yeah, this reversible religious dimension comes out in the very beginning in a funny way.

290
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:49,440
The mixture of entertainment and deep religion is just amazing in this movie.

291
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:55,600
You remember what the porter says about Harry Lyme, who's dead?

292
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,639
He's either in heaven, no, sorry, he's in heaven or in hell.

293
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:03,840
That is, he just reverses the dimensions.

294
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:16,159
And the movie immediately cuts to the next scene where they're burying Harry Lyme, and the priest is saying descended into hell for three days and rose on the third day.

295
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:27,040
That is, there is a constant sort of traffic between sinners and saints, heaven and hell, going on in this Christian dimension.

296
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,360
And so where are we now?

297
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,880
Descended into hell and rose on the seventh day.

298
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,280
I said third, but I wrote it down here.

299
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,079
Now, let's do Anna.

300
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:38,720
Put Anna.

301
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,319
Okay, Anna's over here.

302
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,399
She's clearly the positive religion.

303
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,120
Well, she's so she's got unconditional commitment.

304
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:50,959
I'm going to give you this handout so you don't have to read my writing.

305
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:53,439
She's selfless.

306
00:27:53,439 --> 00:28:02,000
She doesn't think about herself at all when she's being carried off by the Russians to their headquarters because she's been turned in.

307
00:28:01,999 --> 00:28:05,040
And then she hears that Harry is still alive.

308
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:13,760
She completely forgets her problem that she's about to be exported, or what is it, extradited or something back to Czechoslovakia.

309
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,320
And she's only interested in, is Harry all right?

310
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:16,959
Is he hurt?

311
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:17,599
Where is he?

312
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:18,960
And so forth.

313
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:23,760
Now, something I haven't mentioned here, well, let's bring it up first.

314
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:38,760
You might ask yourself, and I'm sort of warning you about what I think is a danger in writing a possible paper, but you can still trump me, but you've got to at least be aware that it might be misleading.

315
00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:43,880
In Kierkegaard terms, what kind of person do you think she is?

316
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,919
I mean, is she a night of faith or a night of resignation?

317
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:50,680
Well, it's hard to tell that you're having a sensible reaction.

318
00:28:50,919 --> 00:29:01,800
It's too soon to tell because she's in grief, and she says that he will always be a part of her.

319
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:05,559
But, well, you have a hand up.

320
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:06,760
Go ahead.

321
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:10,439
Yeah, well, I thought she said that he would always be a part of her.

322
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,559
That's right.

323
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:18,919
And you're going to give someone back in.

324
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,360
Oh, good, good.

325
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,159
That's interesting.

326
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:25,240
Yeah, that's what I think is the trap.

327
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,760
I think it's misleading, but let's go through it.

328
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:39,560
One thing is that they both sound the same in this business of, or even not, I mean, she says he's a part of me.

329
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:40,919
He's in me.

330
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:44,280
And it certainly always will be a part of me.

331
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:51,560
I think of that as the interiorizing that goes on in grief, but it's too early to tell.

332
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:56,040
But it isn't as if she's saying, I'll always remember him.

333
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:01,880
It's that she's letting go, I think, of remembering him.

334
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:08,200
I think maybe she is when she's in his bedroom and she's looking at the comb and putting it back in the drawer.

335
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:16,560
I think it's clearer that she's letting go of him, that is, accepting the fact that he's dead and gone and just second and put away.

336
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:22,480
But the first time he's buried, she does not throw dirt into the grave.

337
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:23,760
It's interesting.

338
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:34,320
She does not, somehow, with a kind of mystical intuition, I don't understand, she senses that he's not really dead, or she senses that she's not ready to accept him as really dead or something.

339
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,320
But the second time, she does throw the dirt in the grave.

340
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,720
And I think that's also saying, this is now over.

341
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,640
I'm putting it in the past.

342
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,079
It's changed me.

343
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,919
It's part of me.

344
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,119
But I'm not going to dwell on it.

345
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:55,360
I'm going to dwell in it, to use this kind of slogan I use.

346
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:01,599
And I think she'll find another, I think she's a knight of faith, and I think she'll find another lover when she gets over her grief.

347
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:04,639
Let me just say, well, first, he had a handout.

348
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,120
Yeah.

349
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:09,919
She keeps calling Holly Harry once he insists on getting the love letters back then.

350
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,200
Nice point.

351
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,079
I don't know.

352
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:12,960
I like that.

353
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:18,319
I mean, the mixing up and calling him Harry and Holly, again, I just think that's so soon.

354
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,320
What happens when they're ready to go for a drink?

355
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,240
She says, you know, Holly always, or Harry always said, let's go for a drink.

356
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,120
And she, she, I mean, I can understand that.

357
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:33,919
Getting the love letters back, when does she insist on getting the love letters back?

358
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,439
Well, she doesn't say, am I going to get them back?

359
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:39,759
The pain says, don't worry, you're going to get them back.

360
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,960
Isn't that what happens?

361
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:45,040
I want to say she doesn't care whether she gets them back, but I don't know.

362
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:49,360
We'd have to, I don't want to take time in the lecture because I don't think I can flip to it.

363
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:56,720
But but if you're interested, it's important, he's right, to ask yourself the question, what is her attitude toward those love letters?

364
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:05,160
I have another very funny reason why I think she's a knight of fate, but it's very important for this course, so I have to go into it.

365
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:07,800
What does she play when she plays in the theater?

366
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,880
She's a singer and an actress.

367
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,880
Comedies or tragedies?

368
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,160
Comedies.

369
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,640
Do you understand what that means?

370
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,479
What is a comedy?

371
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:22,200
Of course, it's something funny and people laugh, but that's not the essence of comedies.

372
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,439
You may have learned this in school when you were learning about tragedies and comedies.

373
00:32:26,439 --> 00:32:33,240
Supposedly, in comedies, the problems are reconciled and everything turns out all right.

374
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:40,680
That should remind you of Kierkegaard saying that in the world of the spirit, he who is ready to suffer anguish gets the bread.

375
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:59,479
I think that she's in this dimension where everybody gets what they deserve, and she certainly suffers, she seems to be, or she may well be suffering grief in the right way, in which case she'll get another lover in due course.

376
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:00,919
Wait, first he had his hand up.

377
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:01,560
Yeah.

378
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:02,360
She does.

379
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,079
She does.

380
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:03,639
Very good.

381
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,399
I was going to mention that, but forgot.

382
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:14,919
That's, from my point of view, the trap will lead you into thinking she's in resignation when I think she has to be, just for the structure of the book.

383
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:18,360
She has to be the highest form of Christian.

384
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,760
She has to be, I think, a total lover.

385
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:26,919
She's, you know, she's at the top of, you know, she lives in the attic while he lives in the sewer, so to speak.

386
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:31,240
She has to be the top sort of Christian, I think.

387
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:36,200
But of course, grief, she has to go through grief in the right way.

388
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:46,880
And all of you always seem to look at me with resistance when I try to say that grief is the paradoxical emotion in which you naturally think that this is the last time.

389
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:49,599
There's no other way to think about it.

390
00:33:49,919 --> 00:34:02,800
You can't, this is the defining relation, and it defines all the characteristics of what counts as sexy and funny and good-looking and so forth.

391
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:13,280
You won't have another opportunity, it feels like, when you've lost them and you're in grief, until you've made the movement complete of interiorizing them.

392
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,519
But so we can't tell.

393
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,799
I'm neutral.

394
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,480
I mean, I'm not saying, look, she says, I don't want to fall in love again.

395
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:27,039
I can't say that proves that she's going through grief in the right way.

396
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:30,960
I just want to say you can't tell when she says that.

397
00:34:30,959 --> 00:34:40,560
I mean, if she had said, I still love him and I will always love him, that would be getting to be suspicious.

398
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:44,320
But all she says is, I don't want to love anybody else.

399
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,360
And I think I understand what that means.

400
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:47,999
Go ahead.

401
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:57,439
By virtue of the impossible, so to speak.

402
00:34:57,439 --> 00:34:59,039
But who's the clue?

403
00:34:59,039 --> 00:34:59,919
Who's clear than I got?

404
00:34:59,919 --> 00:35:00,719
Holly?

405
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,040
Perry.

406
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:04,880
A knight of resignation.

407
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,599
What did you say?

408
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,799
I just misunderstood you.

409
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,360
I don't get my virtual.

410
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,279
Harry Lyme?

411
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,000
No, he's a total sinner.

412
00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:18,240
And with complete an unconditional commitment to himself.

413
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,320
That is not what a knight of resignation has.

414
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,279
Let's get this straight.

415
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:44,360
A knight of resignation has a condition, is self-contained, but they have a condition to the memory of the lover, not to themselves, but to the remembering, preserving the meaning of this relationship, whether they're in it or whether the person is dead.

416
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:47,159
To be a knight of resignation is a high-level thing.

417
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:47,800
It's a form.

418
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:52,840
I mean, the Harry Lyn is just a villain.

419
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,679
I mean, the Lemiula puzzle.

420
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,760
I mean, he has no redeeming features.

421
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,959
I'll be interested, yeah?

422
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,679
I work to whether you could have.

423
00:36:00,919 --> 00:36:03,080
Yeah, well, the answer is no.

424
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,479
But, well, that's no.

425
00:36:05,479 --> 00:36:06,360
Let me take that back.

426
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:17,399
The important thing is: would it give you the vulnerability that comes with the finite and the temporal?

427
00:36:17,399 --> 00:36:19,160
And the answer is no.

428
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:28,279
It wouldn't, because you couldn't lose yourself, or at least if you did, you wouldn't be around to be vulnerable about it.

429
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:36,439
And you don't have, there wouldn't be a certain moment when all of a sudden you fell in love with yourself and it was the instant.

430
00:36:36,439 --> 00:36:39,960
And from then on, you understood that you had been in love with yourself all along.

431
00:36:39,959 --> 00:36:43,480
That's just not sensible phenomenology.

432
00:36:44,439 --> 00:36:59,160
So it's, but Kierkegaard does say that the knight of resignation discovers that they're sufficient unto themselves because they've taken over and incorporated the meaning of their involvement.

433
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:05,239
But you can't define yourself in terms, I think we have a paper topic on that, don't we?

434
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,840
So I better stop talking about it.

435
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:12,599
Is there a paper topic that says, can you have a defining relation to the ethical?

436
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:13,880
Can you have a defining relation to yourself?

437
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,759
It may be the first one.

438
00:37:17,999 --> 00:37:19,439
Well, that's just as well.

439
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:20,959
Then I can talk about it.

440
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,560
So you can't define yourself in terms of the ethical because it's not vulnerable.

441
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:34,720
And you really can't see the sword hanging over the head of the beloved if the beloved is you and live as if it's the surest thing of all.

442
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,559
I mean, you could say what that meant was.

443
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:40,079
You could see that you could be killed, but you live as if you wouldn't be.

444
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,320
But that'd be a funny way to think about it.

445
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:44,640
Let me see if I can say anything more.

446
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,360
It seems so obvious to me, that's hard.

447
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,720
Well, Kierkegaard thinks, anyway, let's get that straight.

448
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,759
That you've got to have a defining commitment to something outside yourself.

449
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,999
And he says it in the thing I've handed out.

450
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:01,199
Well, I can know.

451
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,719
That would be very confusing.

452
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,199
Never mind.

453
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,040
We'll get to it next time.

454
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:11,919
But you've got to have an unconditional commitment for something outside of specifically for Kierkegaard.

455
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,199
But that's because it's got to do with the finite and temporal.

456
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,999
I don't know what more to say, but I see that people are confused and not satisfied with this.

457
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:23,120
Let me see.

458
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:43,759
Being a sinner, an ultimate selfish sinner, is very, very different than being a knight of resignation, who is admirable, who loves God, who is in a kind of serene state and so forth.

459
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,280
It just doesn't fit.

460
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:45,919
Yeah.

461
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,160
Good thinking.

462
00:38:48,399 --> 00:38:51,360
Well, it's not above the universal.

463
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,679
But both of you, you're absolutely right.

464
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,760
It's not just lower immediacy.

465
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,559
The way he's related to himself, remember, I said isn't just like a child.

466
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:01,559
If it were, I would have an easy answer to you.

467
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:02,919
But it isn't like that.

468
00:39:02,919 --> 00:39:05,720
He's like the Knight of Resignation.

469
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,079
He understands the attraction of the ethical.

470
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:10,120
Harry does.

471
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:15,000
It's just that he finds his own well-being higher.

472
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:17,399
And the other thing you said was important, too.

473
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:18,280
What was it?

474
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,840
Oh, yeah.

475
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,399
It's funny.

476
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:22,199
I was going to say that, and then I thought I could get away with not saying it.

477
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,960
I was going to, you got me.

478
00:39:23,959 --> 00:39:43,640
I was going to say, and look, the night of resignation isn't in despair, but of course, the night of resignation is sort of in this is in despair, as we discovered at the end of Hiroshima Monomore, or because the night of resignation, get the finite and temporal related in the right way.

479
00:39:43,959 --> 00:39:45,640
So it's a topic.

480
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:51,160
I mean, I see that I can't make a case that is knocked down and drag out convincing.

481
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,839
But my intuition is untouched.

482
00:39:54,840 --> 00:40:06,919
I mean, if you look at her, Anna, and where she lives and the way she lives and how she reacts, everything she does is sort of saint.

483
00:40:06,999 --> 00:40:08,279
She is a saint.

484
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:12,999
And in Kierkegaard language, that would have to be a night of faith.

485
00:40:12,999 --> 00:40:14,439
It's really a Catholic book.

486
00:40:14,439 --> 00:40:15,639
That's part of the problem.

487
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:21,160
We have trouble sort of mashing the Catholic book into Protestant categories here.

488
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:29,719
But insofar as being a knight of resignation is, so to speak, second best, Anna can't be a knight of resignation.

489
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,320
Anna is best.

490
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,160
She is the absolutely positive.

491
00:40:35,959 --> 00:40:46,080
If you could make the case that there isn't anything higher than resignation, I would begin to worry.

492
00:40:42,919 --> 00:40:48,800
But it's clear that there's something higher than resignation.

493
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:56,080
There is total devotion and total devotion to an actual other person.

494
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,560
And that's what she's certainly got.

495
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:04,239
Okay, I think that's fascinating, but now I've got to go back to this or I'll run out of time.

496
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:04,960
Let's see.

497
00:41:04,959 --> 00:41:06,800
But let's read what she says.

498
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,959
She says things, I've listed them here, that sound like resignation, but they could equally sound like grief.

499
00:41:12,959 --> 00:41:15,760
She says, I want to be dead too.

500
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:21,759
And that's, and she says, I don't want to fall in love again.

501
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:33,119
And all I can say is everybody, any, if you don't go through that kind of grief, you couldn't become a knight of resignation or a knight of faith.

502
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,439
So she's got to go through that grief.

503
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,359
Okay, I can't do more.

504
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,880
And so let me go on.

505
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,159
So she says, however, also that Harry is a part of her.

506
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,360
He is in her.

507
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,640
I mentioned that.

508
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:53,919
She's not trying, I don't think she's trying to remember him, his voice, his hands, and so forth.

509
00:41:54,399 --> 00:41:56,479
And now, but I've said, oh, I can.

510
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:59,840
I shouldn't even have started falling back into it again.

511
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,439
But another way to put it, and now we better get to the crucial thing.

512
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:12,720
Yeah, let's talk about one more important thing about her.

513
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:24,240
And it has to do with how she reacts when she sees that Harry has killed lots of children with the doctored penicillin.

514
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:41,160
Now, we said that when Harry, sorry, when Holly sees the evidence, then he moves to a higher ethical and he helps turn in Harry.

515
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:48,760
He does the heroic thing, he subsumes loyalty to Harry under a higher ethical, and he goes out to help catch the murderer.

516
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,399
Now, what does Anna think about that?

517
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,720
That's what gets interesting.

518
00:42:53,720 --> 00:43:00,360
She says, you're beginning to get a clue when we start thinking about this, about how the movie has to end.

519
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:12,360
What does she say to Holly in the important conversation in the cafe in the railroad station when she's telling him how much she detests him, in effect?

520
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:16,280
She says, there's a name for faces like yours.

521
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,880
What's she saying?

522
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,320
What's the name?

523
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:23,960
What is he doing from her point of view when he's there in that railroad station?

524
00:43:23,959 --> 00:43:29,960
Well, she's helping the police, he's helping the police catch Harry.

525
00:43:29,959 --> 00:43:32,120
He's betraying Harry.

526
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:39,720
The name for that face is police informer, but more generic name for it is betrayer.

527
00:43:40,039 --> 00:44:09,960
She's got a view about betrayal, which is utterly different than Harry's, who just does it because he can't help being a sinner and feels despair about it, or Holly, who betrays because he rightly sees that he's making, or from his point of view, rightly sees, a heroic choice of suspending the lower ethical for a higher ethical.

528
00:44:09,959 --> 00:44:11,560
What's her view?

529
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:18,800
Her view is that once you love somebody unconditionally, you can't betray them.

530
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:26,000
It's not even, and now let me read you the kinds where it becomes.

531
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,960
So when she finds out that Harry is a murderer, what does she say?

532
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:34,160
Very important lines on 93 and 94.

533
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,040
They're so important that I'll just read them.

534
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,119
And then we have to understand them.

535
00:44:39,439 --> 00:44:47,279
She says, there are so many things you don't know about a person you love, good things, bad things.

536
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:54,000
And then she says, a man doesn't alter because you find out more.

537
00:44:53,999 --> 00:44:55,919
That's the crucial line.

538
00:44:55,919 --> 00:44:58,159
Why is that important?

539
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:11,200
Well, that's important because what she's saying is: if you love somebody so that they're the paradigm, then everything gets its meaning through that relationship.

540
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,680
And everything.

541
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:31,840
So that even being a murderer is relative to the fact that it's Harry Lyme, the most important, not only the most important thing in the world, the person who defines what matters in the world and defines what counts as important in good and bad.

542
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:44,160
That person, no matter what properties you find out about him, good things and bad things on 93, you don't alter your relation because you find out more.

543
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,320
Nothing, and it's almost a tautology.

544
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,840
Nothing trumps an unconditional commitment.

545
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,200
That's what she's saying.

546
00:45:51,200 --> 00:46:03,160
Nothing you could find out about somebody, no property of Harry Lyme, could trump the fact that he's her unconditional commitment, her savior, the one who gave her her identity.

547
00:46:03,479 --> 00:46:08,919
Another bride student pointed out to me that he gave her her identity papers, too.

548
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:20,360
And that crucial person is just, if you have a real unconditional commitment, you can't betray them.

549
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:25,160
You can't, there's no position from which you could hurt them.

550
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:35,800
And she said, and this is the moment, really, in the movie, when her view and Holly Martin's view just simply diverge.

551
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,880
She's got this unconditionally commitment.

552
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:49,399
No possible, while all the others have their mode of betrayal, selfish betrayal, ethical betrayal, and so forth.

553
00:46:49,399 --> 00:46:51,480
For her, it's impossible.

554
00:46:51,479 --> 00:46:57,880
And now, and let me, I'm trying to keep track of all these things.

555
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:03,160
So that means, so total, I guess, totally faithful.

556
00:47:03,479 --> 00:47:05,159
I'm not anything about faith.

557
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:18,360
I'm just saying once your love has been made in heaven, you can't go against it without despair and destroying your whole identity.

558
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:36,360
Okay, now when you see that, you see how far it is from Holly Martin's, because Holly Martin's has got a view that when you find out something else about somebody you sort of loved in his sense of love, she says, What do you mean, love?

559
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,960
How do you spell the word?

560
00:47:37,959 --> 00:47:47,919
Because when he, so, because his view of love is, it's just another strong relation which gets trumped when you discover that the guy's a murderer.

561
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:53,840
She says, and Martin is done.

562
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,160
He says, you still love Harry, don't you?

563
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,120
But then this is the crucial moment when they sort of, you see the utter difference.

564
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:06,399
He says, I hate, well, she says, a man doesn't alter because you find out more.

565
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:08,640
And he says, I hate the way you talk.

566
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,600
I've got a splitting headache, and you talk and you talk.

567
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:12,960
You make me cross.

568
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:17,679
At that point, he's really saying, I can't understand what you're saying.

569
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:27,040
I can't even picture what that world would be because he's over here in his kind of ethical.

570
00:48:27,999 --> 00:48:31,520
Okay, I'm going to put that aside for a while, but I'll come back to it.

571
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,840
I have to see where we are.

572
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,880
So what she's doing is incomprehensible to him.

573
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:45,439
She thinks that betraying one individual you love is worse than being a mass murderer.

574
00:48:45,439 --> 00:48:46,479
You realize that.

575
00:48:46,479 --> 00:48:51,520
She's saying that you, she's saying to Holly, you are worse than Harry.

576
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:54,399
You betrayed somebody you loved.

577
00:48:57,919 --> 00:49:06,399
And that is, and I more detest that, I more hate that than I do somebody whom I love who's a mass murderer.

578
00:49:06,399 --> 00:49:14,560
Now, I want to test her intuitions because I'm always interested in sort of where the world is in these issues, and you are where the world is.

579
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:15,360
So, yeah.

580
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:19,840
Ah, you have, yeah, yes, she does, because she's been told.

581
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,479
So, he's betrayed her.

582
00:49:21,479 --> 00:49:22,200
Right.

583
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,279
Isn't that interesting?

584
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:28,880
I wasn't going to bring it up because I thought it would maybe cross too many people's wires, but that's important.

585
00:49:29,959 --> 00:49:36,040
Because you could ask, but how come she so much hates Harry for betraying her?

586
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:39,640
And she forgives Holly for betraying her.

587
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,080
And what's the answer?

588
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:41,720
Yeah.

589
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:45,639
That's a good move.

590
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,759
I hadn't thought of it that way.

591
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:52,520
One, you could say, well, he doesn't have an unconditional commitment to her.

592
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,840
He just likes her a lot.

593
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:58,359
I would rather say yes to Harry.

594
00:49:58,919 --> 00:50:01,960
And what follows from that, I'm not sure we're saying the same thing.

595
00:50:01,959 --> 00:50:08,680
But all I want, and the simple thing to say is, well, being a betrayer is just another property you can find out about somebody.

596
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:19,640
No property, even the ultimate property, that they're a sinner who belongs at the bottom of hell, can trump the fact that they're your defining commitment that gives you your identity.

597
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:33,560
Because that defining commitment determines the significance of all possible properties of that person, including, and that's why it's such an interesting thing, like Beatrice asks, including being a betrayer.

598
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:39,639
She knows it, and because it's Harry who's the betrayer, she forgives him.

599
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:45,800
She doesn't have a universal kind of ethical conviction, don't betray.

600
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,080
That's another way to put it.

601
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:55,639
If she had the principle, don't betray, then we'd have to say, well, how come she's holding it against Harry that he's a betrayer?

602
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,679
Why doesn't she hold it against Holly that he's a betrayer?

603
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,159
Why doesn't she hold it against Harry that he's in a betrayer?

604
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,880
That was what Beatrice rightly asks.

605
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,600
And the answer is, because she's not ethical.

606
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:14,720
Because if she were ethical, she would have to, you know, do the ethical is don't make a special case out of it.

607
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:18,399
Do what any person does, obey the universal.

608
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,800
That means detest, in this case, betrayers.

609
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,720
But she's not in the universal business.

610
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,240
She's in the individual business, and that's totally different.

611
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,800
Now, I wanted to say something more about her.

612
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,880
Well, I don't know, but I'm sure I'll get back to it.

613
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,359
It's just another way of saying the same thing.

614
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,480
So, oh, yeah, I got back to it right away by looking at my notes.

615
00:51:40,479 --> 00:51:47,680
Okay, the ultimate thing is that she really, how would this relate her to the ethical?

616
00:51:47,680 --> 00:52:02,560
Well, if she were in contact with the ethical at all, she'd have to be suspending the ethical, but not in a higher ethical, but just suspending the ethical from some other absolute way of understanding things.

617
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,320
And of course, she does suspend the ethical.

618
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:07,919
What does she do that is anti-ethical?

619
00:52:07,919 --> 00:52:10,800
Well, she's obstructing justice.

620
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:24,639
Just as Holly is a police informer, she could go to prison because she says look out the police and so forth.

621
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:31,039
She warns Harry, and that's how he starts, and he almost gets away, and that causes finally the death of pain and everything.

622
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:32,720
It's all in a way her fault.

623
00:52:33,439 --> 00:52:35,360
But she would do it again.

624
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:42,479
She just believes that you can just suspend the ethical if you have an unconditional commitment.

625
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:45,919
You can't help but suspend the ethical if you have an unconditional commitment.

626
00:52:46,399 --> 00:52:48,399
That's the crucial thing.

627
00:52:48,959 --> 00:52:57,120
Now, we're doing okay, but I have to get more about, oh, she says Harry the police.

628
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:58,600
And now, Holly again.

629
00:52:58,599 --> 00:53:01,479
Back to Holly, because we haven't said enough about.

630
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:04,360
Well, I'm going to say quick things about Holly.

631
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:08,120
Just that he's totally outside the religious.

632
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:12,600
So he has no answer when Harry says, and what do you believe in?

633
00:53:12,919 --> 00:53:16,679
He has nothing to say when he has to lecture on the crisis of faith.

634
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,840
He doesn't even know what it is.

635
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:24,840
He's very funny when he's blowing the dust off the religious relics in Dr.

636
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,919
Winkle's waiting room.

637
00:53:26,919 --> 00:53:30,839
And he says, nice, nice stuff you have here.

638
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,680
He doesn't even know what it is.

639
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:37,959
Because he's no more secular than Calloway.

640
00:53:37,959 --> 00:53:41,720
Now we've got, and Callaway is the positive ethical.

641
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:50,919
In what way now is Calloway, oh sorry, Holly, not the negative ethical.

642
00:53:51,240 --> 00:54:03,399
Well, because he's dangerous and he's dangerous, and this is interesting, because he's so innocent that he can't really understand any of the motives of any of the evil people.

643
00:54:03,399 --> 00:54:06,280
He can't understand Anna.

644
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,399
Oh, what happened to Anna?

645
00:54:07,399 --> 00:54:08,600
Here, Anna.

646
00:54:08,919 --> 00:54:10,439
And we've seen that.

647
00:54:10,439 --> 00:54:11,880
She gives him a headache.

648
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:15,640
He can't understand.

649
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,040
Well, Harry, he doesn't even try to understand.

650
00:54:18,039 --> 00:54:20,360
He can't understand.

651
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,040
What am I doing here?

652
00:54:22,039 --> 00:54:23,399
The positive ethical.

653
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,119
Okay.

654
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,959
He brings the negative ethical.

655
00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:28,760
Yes, why?

656
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:34,439
He just can't understand anything in the ethical dimension.

657
00:54:34,439 --> 00:54:36,759
But I'm not doing well.

658
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,399
That's true, but that's not important.

659
00:54:39,399 --> 00:54:46,080
Because Callaway can't understand anything outside of the ethical dimension either.

660
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:50,080
But Hannah says about Calloway that you're a fool.

661
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:53,520
And she says you've got it all upside down.

662
00:54:53,519 --> 00:54:55,040
And what does that mean?

663
00:54:55,039 --> 00:55:02,719
Well, that means that he trumps unconditional commitments with his professional devotion to the ethical.

664
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:05,680
And for him, that is the highest.

665
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:14,800
And so that I want to see where she says that, Halloway here.

666
00:55:16,399 --> 00:55:20,880
It looks like he's callous, but he's not, that he's being professional.

667
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:31,600
He really feels compassion for and love sort of for pain, and he almost forgets his duty, which is his duty is to keep people from getting hurt.

668
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:37,439
And then he gets, when pain gets killed, he forgets for a minute that he's trying to keep Holly from getting hurt.

669
00:55:37,439 --> 00:55:40,480
And then he starts running after him.

670
00:55:40,479 --> 00:55:46,080
He's very, he's not sort of a happy upbeat at all.

671
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,480
He says, death is at the bottom of everything.

672
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:51,439
Holly, leave death to the professionals.

673
00:55:51,760 --> 00:56:06,239
So he, and the simplest way to think about it is the negative ethical is a kind of, I haven't said anything about it, there isn't much said about it, but it's a kind of vigilante ethical.

674
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:11,519
That is, he hasn't got, he doesn't go, he isn't going to take people to court.

675
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:13,200
He's a cowboy ethical.

676
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:24,160
He just thinks that he trusts his own intuition, he trusts his own honesty, and he decides on who are the bad guys and who are the bad guys on his own.

677
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,480
And that makes him very dangerous.

678
00:56:26,479 --> 00:56:35,159
Calloway does his duty, tries to keep people from getting hurt, makes sacrifices of his personal sentiments for the ethical.

679
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:39,640
That's how he drops Payne's body to run and try to help Holly.

680
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:48,280
And that's so there are two kinds of ethical: there is the sober, realistic kind, and this cowboy kind.

681
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,559
Now, are we?

682
00:56:50,519 --> 00:57:03,559
So, Calloway is not heroic, he's not tragic, he just does his job and he does, and he follows the law and so forth, and he gets his criminal.

683
00:57:03,559 --> 00:57:08,439
Okay, oh, now I wanted to tell you something important here, just a second.

684
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,360
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.

685
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,279
Too many things to keep crackling.

686
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:17,880
I was about to ask you the question: I want to know how it's going in the world of the spirit, and you guys know.

687
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:31,480
How many think that you should remain faithful to the person you love or to the cause, to your unconditional commitment, even if it turns out that they're a mass murderer?

688
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:35,640
I mean, in other words, how many are going to identify with honor?

689
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:38,999
Nobody are used to, I mean, I hope there are some.

690
00:57:38,999 --> 00:57:40,279
I feel very unhappy.

691
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,159
Okay, there are some.

692
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:41,559
Few.

693
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:45,080
Oh, it was 50-50 the last time we did it, only two years ago.

694
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:55,399
How many think that if you discover somebody's a mass murderer, even if you love them, you have to turn them in, even though that looks like betrayal?

695
00:57:55,399 --> 00:57:56,999
Well, well, well, okay.

696
00:57:56,999 --> 00:57:59,880
You're all getting more and more secular by the minute.

697
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:05,399
But I will worry about that.

698
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:08,599
And then see if I can figure out how to get.

699
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:10,679
I was happy when it was 50-50.

700
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,320
I think that you see why I was happy when it was 50-50?

701
00:58:13,439 --> 00:58:16,880
Because that's the Greek versus the Hebrew Christian.

702
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:30,640
And I was really asking you: how many are in the Greek tradition of ethics and universal principles and so forth, and how many are in the religious tradition of unconditional commitments to something like a Savior?

703
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:35,519
And it looks like the religious side is not strongly represented.

704
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,719
I hope this culture stays committed to both sides.

705
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,079
It's a very rich culture.

706
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:40,800
I saw a hand.

707
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:41,519
What was it?

708
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:41,840
Yeah.

709
00:58:42,479 --> 00:58:43,600
What's that?

710
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,120
Holly was what?

711
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:47,439
A tragic hero, Holly.

712
00:58:47,439 --> 00:58:50,079
Yeah, I said he thinks he is, I meant.

713
00:58:50,079 --> 00:59:06,560
He thinks he sacrificed, he has to suspend the ethical of loving Harry for higher ethical, namely get mass murderers out of this world.

714
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:11,039
Okay, let me quickly do what I want to do, the last thing, because I'm kind of proud of this thing I wrote.

715
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:18,080
I want to talk about what each person is thinking as the movie ends.

716
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:20,719
Okay, I think I've got ready to talk about that.

717
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:21,279
Yes.

718
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,519
Okay, so Calloway, one more thing I have to say first, I guess.

719
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:31,120
Calloway thinks, doesn't understand unconditional commitment any more than Holly does.

720
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:38,719
He thinks that by offering to save Anna from the Russians, he can get her to come over to his side and help turn Harry in.

721
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,399
And she says, you're wrong about everything.

722
00:59:40,399 --> 00:59:41,679
You have everything upside down.

723
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,599
You're a fool because he thinks that.

724
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:47,519
Now, here's what each is thinking.

725
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,000
I want to say, what is each thinking at the end of the movie?

726
00:59:49,999 --> 00:59:52,959
Calloway says to himself, I got my man.

727
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:53,999
The pain is dead.

728
00:59:53,999 --> 00:59:57,919
It's a hard job being a professional policeman and keeping people from getting hurt.

729
00:59:57,919 --> 00:59:59,960
Death is at the bottom of everything.

730
00:59:59,959 --> 01:00:03,479
Now, all I have to do is get that dangerous cowboy out of Vienna.

731
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:05,079
He's rushing him to the plane.

732
01:00:05,399 --> 01:00:08,519
Holly thinks, I'm like the sheriff of Santa Fe.

733
01:00:08,519 --> 01:00:11,320
I've come into this corrupt town and cleaned things up.

734
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,519
I killed the bad guy.

735
01:00:12,519 --> 01:00:14,520
I made a fool of the bad sheriff.

736
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:19,640
Now all I have to do is save the damsel in distress, and we'll walk off into the sunset together.

737
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:22,840
That was also what Graham Greene and Carol Reed were thinking.

738
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,399
Anna's thinking, I'm glad Harry is dead.

739
01:00:25,399 --> 01:00:29,239
I would not want to have seen him again anyway, that I would never betray him.

740
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,880
Holly turned out to be even worse than Harry.

741
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:35,399
Harry was a murderer, but Holly was a betrayer.

742
01:00:35,399 --> 01:00:39,399
Now, with all that in mind, what happens in the last scene?

743
01:00:39,399 --> 01:00:48,280
Well, it looks like there's something not even tragic, because that would require that they be in the same world and in the same dimension.

744
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:59,640
There is no dimension that can bring the two spheres of existence, the religious and the ethical, in their good or bad forms, together.

745
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:05,560
So you get the most moving of all the reversals in this perfect movie.

746
01:01:05,559 --> 01:01:07,880
Holly gets out and waits for Anna.

747
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,880
Halloway drives away.

748
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,840
Now he's driving his own Jeep because Payne is dead.

749
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:18,760
Holly stands there and lights a cigarette, waiting for her, expecting them to walk off together.

750
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:23,720
She approaches him and gets closer and closer and closer and closer, so slowly.

751
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:29,399
And the music rises to a climax, and just at the moment we expect her to turn and she doesn't.

752
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,640
This happens to me every time I see the movie.

753
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,479
And you think, well, she's about to turn.

754
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:34,439
She's about to turn.

755
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,399
And finally, you realize, oh my god, she's passed him already.

756
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,559
And she didn't even look at him.

757
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,239
And now we know why.

758
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:52,399
We know why, because she's in this totally different understanding of what it is to be a human being and to relate to other human beings than he is.

759
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,639
But he, naturally, has understood nothing.

760
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:08,880
And the last gesture he makes, he lights a cigarette and then he throws it away in this special gesture, which you see once before in the movie, which you won't realize, I think, if you've only seen it once or twice.

761
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:16,880
It's the same gesture he makes after he chases Harry Lyme into that big empty space, and all of a sudden Harry Lyme has disappeared.

762
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,239
Remember, he's gone in the sewer.

763
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:19,199
We don't know that.

764
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:24,079
Then he puts his hand in some water, he puts his water on his face, and then he goes like that.

765
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:34,319
That's a gesture of total and annoyed, isn't the right word, infuriated incomprehension about what just happened.

766
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:37,039
And that's the end of the movie.

767
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:44,399
And it turns out to be an amazing movie because that's a very deep movie, and it's also a very entertaining movie.

768
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,519
And that's that.

769
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:45,919
Okay.

770
01:02:46,239 --> 01:02:48,720
Now, don't go away, because we have one more.

771
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:49,919
Now I'll give you out the chart.

772
01:02:49,919 --> 01:02:53,599
I just didn't want to have so many different pages running around at once.

773
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:58,720
Here's the chart and an old page from long back that I promised and never gave out.

774
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:00,560
You know, yeah, we should.
