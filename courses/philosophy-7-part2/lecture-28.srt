1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,680
The idea that you could be so involved in something that that was seen to be the most important and most satisfying thing in your life, and you're going to keep it forever.

2
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:23,400
And at the same time, you know from past experience that you've had that experience lots of times, and eventually these things stop being exciting and you and some new thing grabs you.

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,359
Now, question.

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,920
Kierkegaard defines commitments to infem.

5
00:00:29,799 --> 00:00:37,400
Something that's like some or not something that's ephemeral, but something that is undistinguished and something that is not fine.

6
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:38,999
That's right.

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,159
The Kierkegaard ones are eternal.

8
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:44,839
You can't lose them.

9
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:48,599
I had a discussion about that in office hours, and it was very interesting.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,839
By the way, I wrote down here to tell everybody that my office hours for Philosophy 7 are 2 to 3 on Wednesday.

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,480
Very few people show up for that.

12
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:01,000
Let me write it down again.

13
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,479
Then we'll come back to your question.

14
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:04,759
But this came up in office.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,799
I take it, you know that it's 303 Moses.

16
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:15,320
So now, yeah, it came up, and I went back and looked at the Kierkegaard.

17
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:22,599
I don't know, I had the dim memory that it so much defines you that you can't give it up.

18
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:26,919
The issue was: can you freely give up an unconditional commitment?

19
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:29,880
I think the answer is clearly for Kierkegaard.

20
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:33,640
And again, I want to say, pay attention to the phenomenon.

21
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:44,200
If you're in Kierkegaard, which is doing the phenomenon of romantic love, you have the power to resist getting into it.

22
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,520
You can stay away from the other person, you can look at all their faults, you can feel all your inferiorities or whatever.

23
00:01:50,520 --> 00:02:04,040
But if you let yourself be bound, that's a phrase from Heidegger that I like, if you let yourself be bound once you are into that relation, he says explicitly that you can't pull yourself out of it.

24
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:07,440
It's twined about every ligament of your consciousness.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,960
It defines who you are, and you would just be a kind of zombie if you gave it up.

26
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:20,719
That's the real extreme romantic love, knights and ladies phenomenon.

27
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,359
But now, now, not yet.

28
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,719
So, but I want to say, stick to the phenomenon.

29
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:27,919
This is in office hours.

30
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:38,400
Before we went to look at the Kierkegaard, I said, it looks to me like the way romantic love has been described, you are not free, and the way it experienced.

31
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,120
You're not free to just say, I'm going to stop loving this person.

32
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,160
This is just such a mess, it's ruining my life, and I'm just going to just call all to this right now.

33
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,120
It isn't like that.

34
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,520
The other person looks like the most important person in your life, and everything else looks like it's important only relative to that.

35
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,320
And you just can't say it, just quit it.

36
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,200
And while we're on the phenomenon, I mentioned it.

37
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,400
I mean, romantic love is very different than infatuation.

38
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,400
Nietzsche's on to infatuation.

39
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:21,440
He likes the idea that you could be totally overwhelmed in some relation to somebody, but it's in terms of the excitement of it, not letting it define you, but letting it be what is right now the most important and satisfying thing for you.

40
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:32,960
Knowing and feeling that it's for good and knowing that it isn't, because if you felt that before lots of times and it never turned out to be good, those are two different phenomena.

41
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:41,279
And if you stick to trying in your papers too, to stick to describing the experience, then you will be able to understand the books.

42
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:46,560
I mean, very few courses and very few articles do that.

43
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,320
I mean, I don't claim I invented that.

44
00:03:48,480 --> 00:04:00,680
Heidegger's the one who, my guru in the background, who says you should always start paying attention to the phenomenon, then pay attention to the text, and then you will understand the text.

45
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:02,920
So, have I answered you or just made a speech?

46
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,840
I'm not sure, because I didn't really let you finish.

47
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,040
I was filling in the what?

48
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:21,320
A little bit, but it's just sort of one thing if it in positions that we were talking about about how it has to be like you know the blind egoism's experience of completely immigration.

49
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:27,720
I saw that sort of defining way for the thronger thought completely inspired, finding the commitment.

50
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:36,120
And I thought, well, maybe because one of the characteristics of the defining commitment is it has to be something that's vulnerable.

51
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,319
So, what if it?

52
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:41,560
I think you have a good flying meeting.

53
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:50,679
I think I could something by having a defining commitment to something, it's not real defining commitment, to something that isn't, you know, vulnerable.

54
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:58,039
Like a defining commitment, eating the sneeze will be defined and maybe something.

55
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:06,600
So, like a defining commitment to in more concepts, like defining the measurement, you know, like romance love.

56
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,760
So, you throw yourself completely out into the idea of romance and love.

57
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,560
But how do you interpret that games?

58
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,880
Wow, that's interesting.

59
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,640
That's really interesting.

60
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,760
What you've done is reinvent Plato on love.

61
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:23,640
None of you read the symposium, have you, or have you?

62
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:34,919
Plato's written this terrific dialogue about love, and in effect, says that loving any particular person is a crazy thing to do.

63
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:45,120
It's a petty thing to do, it's a stupid thing to do, they're vulnerable and they get old and they're only attractive in some aspects and not in other aspects.

64
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:56,240
He has all a list of reasons why you wouldn't want to have, make a single individual the important thing in your life, but you make love with a capital L the most important thing in your life.

65
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,039
That's what the symposium is about.

66
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:05,600
How you get, but now Nietzsche's going to hate that, that's sure, but we have to figure out why.

67
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,360
Why is it that it somehow tries to avoid suffering?

68
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:20,240
You won't be ever losing it the way you could lose the romantic love object or the infatuation object.

69
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:22,800
That's what Plato thinks is good about it.

70
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:32,800
You love the loving the loving love and loving the lovable in abstract is perfectly safe.

71
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:40,640
But I think you have to attach it to your individual instances.

72
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,080
AID lose and those individual instances.

73
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,760
And then you move on to the next thing.

74
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,880
So while we're maintaining the overall concept.

75
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:57,279
Yeah, well, now you're certainly not Plato anymore because you've got these overall, you stick with these instances and the overall.

76
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,560
But now I don't understand what the overall is doing for you.

77
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:05,360
I mean, brief habits is a series of instances.

78
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:14,160
Well, it says they're all instances of romantic love, for instance, no, or of loving some music or something.

79
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:17,359
So there does it add anything?

80
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,480
I mean, Nietzsche says, too, they're all instances of brief habits.

81
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,200
That's his concept under which all of them fall.

82
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:35,239
I don't see that it makes any difference to your particular commitment to whether it falls under some concept or not.

83
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,400
You're not committed to the concept.

84
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,360
And that's all sort of tied up with Kierkegaard.

85
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,560
Nietzsche would agree that you've got to satisfy the finite and the temporal.

86
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:50,040
And once you're doing that, it's bound to be risky.

87
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:59,080
And bringing it under a concept which is secure either gets rid of the importance of the finite and the temporal, and where are you then?

88
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,920
You're in the night of resignation.

89
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:07,640
You're in love with the principle and nobody, and not the person in particular, and it's safe but unfulfilling.

90
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:19,640
Or you really are in love with or infatuated by the person involved, in which case it's going to be, in one case, changeable, in the other case, risky.

91
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:25,159
But Nietzsche doesn't think you should be sort of trying to defend yourself against the fact that it's changeable.

92
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:28,680
You should just enjoy it as a necessary way.

93
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:40,760
If what you like is the exciting and the wonderful and the surprising, then of course it's going to finally, you're going to lose it.

94
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,400
But that's all right, because there'll be something else wonderful and exciting and surprising.

95
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:53,960
So I guess if we need to talk about it more, it'll have to be in office hours because I'm not getting what you're trying to do.

96
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:57,719
But I know from your questions that there's something important behind what you're saying.

97
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:59,320
I just don't know what it is.

98
00:08:59,319 --> 00:08:59,960
Okay?

99
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,680
Anything else?

100
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,840
Well, then let's go on where we are.

101
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:16,959
That is, I wrote down here to sum up last time, I want to talk about 127 and 129.

102
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,400
I don't remember why.

103
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,560
Whoa, I don't see anything on them.

104
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,240
Maybe that's because, I mean, I'm in here.

105
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,520
Let's hope so.

106
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,240
Yes.

107
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,000
Okay, now I know where I am.

108
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,840
Connecting up with last time.

109
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:37,760
Not with the talk about grief habits last time, which is fine to connect up with, but connecting up with the last talk, last, I guess maybe it was time before last.

110
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,799
I'm not sure I remember.

111
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,960
When did we talk about life being willed to power and the most important thing?

112
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,439
I think that was time before last, right?

113
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:52,320
Okay, well, I'm coming back to it because it's going to be the important issue again today.

114
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:05,760
Nietzsche transvaluates values, he transvaluates them toward being the most alive, flourishing, constantly expanding and outgrowing and overcoming.

115
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,640
That's what is worth doing.

116
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,840
That's what, it isn't as if that's what you ought to do.

117
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,840
Nietzsche doesn't believe in any oughts.

118
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,039
Where would they come from?

119
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,400
And why would you get, and you'd be stuck in them.

120
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:29,760
But what you, this, this kind of higher thing where you never get stuck is not a thing you ought to do, it's something you can't help doing as a living being.

121
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,680
And then comes the question: well, why doesn't everybody do it?

122
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:40,080
Well, everybody does, but some people are strong and do it well and frequently, or and so forth.

123
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:46,080
And some people are sick and weak and degenerate, and they haven't gotten much overcoming and will to power.

124
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:56,600
And those weak people, you're supposed to ignore them or walk all over them if you need to, because they just don't matter from a nature point of view.

125
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:00,360
The powerful ones are the ones who are worth having.

126
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,520
He would get rid of all the weak, decadent, sick ones if he could.

127
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:12,919
And now that's sort of that's that's why am I saying that?

128
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,840
Well, just to remind you where we are.

129
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:23,800
Now, on 127 in Twilight, which I haven't read, I think, because I didn't expect you to have it with you.

130
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:27,480
Now we're at the bottom of 127, summing up what I've just been saying.

131
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,440
What is good?

132
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:33,240
All that heightens the feeling of power, the will to power, power itself in man.

133
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,520
What is bad?

134
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,400
All that proceeds from weakness.

135
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,439
What is happiness?

136
00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:43,080
The feeling that power increases, that a resistance is overcome.

137
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,000
That's pretty clear.

138
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:47,159
But let's go on.

139
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:49,960
He's against notice.

140
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:57,319
And I don't remember again how much I said about this, because what I say in office hours blends in my mind with what I say here.

141
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:10,839
But I want to say, of course, it follows from this that he's against the value of peace and contentment and serenity and such.

142
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:13,800
Those are sort of stagnation.

143
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,159
That's sort of resting.

144
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:18,279
Contentment is being satisfied with where you are.

145
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:26,679
That means you must be a declining part of life because life, when it's flourishing, is never satisfied.

146
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,400
Then this is what he says at the top of 128.

147
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,880
Not contentment, but more power.

148
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,360
Not peace at all, but war.

149
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,839
Not virtue, but proficiency.

150
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,919
That is, mastery, really, I think would be better there.

151
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:49,999
Virtue in the Renaissance style, virtue, which meant free, oh, well, that's free of moralistic acid.

152
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:51,360
That's weird, Nietzsche talk.

153
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:52,239
Never mind.

154
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:54,159
But the virtue, virtue is a funny word.

155
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,239
It used to mean masculinity and strength.

156
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,400
Then it got switched around and it's what women had.

157
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:09,120
And now it's sort of a kind of general term for sort of good characteristics of people.

158
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,640
We don't need to talk about that.

159
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,960
I want to make another speech about peace.

160
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,439
I think I did already, but when you're reading Nietzsche, it keeps coming up.

161
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:29,839
It's so important that Nietzsche sees that you could question, and he does, the idea that what people really want is peace.

162
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:40,640
But yet in the prayers, I mean, the very last word, I think, of the Mass, the Catholic Mass, is, Dona nobis pachem, give us peace.

163
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,560
Why should that be the last word?

164
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,280
Why not say, give us excitement, give us power, and so forth.

165
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:54,560
And I learned a prayer, some Jewish prayer I can't remember very well when I was young, and it ended also peace.

166
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,080
And somewhere there's this prayer begins, give us peace, thy most precious gift.

167
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,360
I think that's probably the Jewish prayer I learned.

168
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,839
But whatever it is, what's so precious about peace, Nietzsche wants to say.

169
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,439
And I think that that's a very important thing to say.

170
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:17,360
A little better than peace, I think, would be at least a kind of tense equilibrium.

171
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:28,519
That's Pascal's proposal, that we live in the extremes of wretchedness and greatness and stretching, filling all the intervening space.

172
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:34,440
But if we follow Jesus, we manage to live there in a way that isn't breaking us up.

173
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:38,439
He was, after all, God and man, and didn't crack him up.

174
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:41,079
That's the Pascal version.

175
00:14:41,080 --> 00:15:06,120
And then in Kierkegaard, you get another version of it where the remember that the last line of the thing on despair that I passed out is that self is, I think, in equilibrium, if I remember that right, is transparently grounded in the power that posited it.

176
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,719
Never mind all that talk.

177
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:10,279
It's the equilibrium I want to mention this time.

178
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:16,519
So for Kierkegaard, you manage to get an equilibrium between the two sides of the self.

179
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,800
And that's sort of a, but it's a kind of tense kind.

180
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:40,759
You didn't read it, I don't think, but he talks about how when you're a knight of faith, you're constantly swimming over 20,000 fathoms, meaning it's a sort of risky way of life in which you put all your eggs in one basket and it's all vulnerable, but you have to live it as if it was the surest thing of all.

181
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:54,199
Those are all ways of not, well, you could put it either way, those are ways of not making just plain contentment and that kind of peace the top thing.

182
00:15:54,199 --> 00:16:14,079
But from Nietzsche's point of view, they would all be ways of trying to make an equilibrium where what you really want, if you want power, and that's what you can't help wanting, being alive, you want a self that's in a constant struggle.

183
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,239
Now, I was going to talk about that.

184
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,159
And I'm going to jump to this because I got to this in a different angle than I thought I was going to.

185
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:27,360
Let me say one more thing about it, though, first.

186
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,120
Some missing.

187
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:39,199
Well, maybe it isn't what I was going to say, but I mean, this is Nietzsche, you must remember, transvaluating all our values.

188
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:50,640
I mean, he's going to not only make life the highest value, but he's going to take peace, which looked like that was the highest value, and turn it into the worst.

189
00:16:50,640 --> 00:17:04,799
Oh, now I remember I was going to say, somewhere he says, that happiness, like contentment at the top of 128, is not anything that any really powerful, alive person wants.

190
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,999
He says there's some aphorism somewhere that says happiness, only the Englishman wants that.

191
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:11,679
That's a strange thing to say.

192
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,839
We read that, don't we somewhere?

193
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:16,719
You saw it in there.

194
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:23,679
But anyway, it's supposed to be, but it sounds like a crazy thing to say that people don't want contentment and happiness.

195
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,159
But the point is, that would be a place to stop.

196
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,439
And, you know, here I am contented and happy.

197
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,439
Now I can just rest.

198
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:39,679
But if you're alive and powerful, you don't ever rest that way.

199
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,679
Only you can rest again.

200
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,039
You know, you've got to go sleep and relax a while in order to go on overcoming everything.

201
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,400
In the end, the goal is constant overcoming.

202
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,280
Okay, Beatrice, yeah.

203
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,400
Is what?

204
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:55,960
What does power mean?

205
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:58,360
Well, that's a good deep philosophical question.

206
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,679
I wonder, let's go back to what I was just quoting.

207
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:05,480
What is good?

208
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:08,040
The feeling of power, power itself.

209
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,319
What is happiness?

210
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,840
The feeling that power increases.

211
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,640
I see what you mean.

212
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,799
Power is just an undefined variable in all that.

213
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:18,199
So what is power?

214
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:23,479
Well, I don't know if I think it helps to say power is constant overcoming.

215
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:35,400
That is, power is what enables you to form grief habits and then go on and do something else, form another.

216
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:45,479
What is the full expression of power would be to be able to create new worlds, new eyes, new suns.

217
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:47,560
You remember S-U-N and all.

218
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,400
That's what the Free Spirit does.

219
00:18:51,400 --> 00:19:11,880
And I think all I can say, I'm not sure, I may be saying something very intelligent and I may not, but all I can say now is: if you want to find out what power is, and you're told that the Free Spirit is the extreme form of the will to power and has more power, and you ask, well, what is the Free Spirit doing with all this power?

220
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:18,919
Well, the Free Spirit isn't just going on from one infatuation in the world to another infatuation in the world.

221
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:33,799
The Free Spirit is going on from inventing one whole world, one whole way of seeing things, to another whole way of seeing things, and in which the previous way, and this is important, is experienced as having been outgrown.

222
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,880
It isn't just sort of arbitrary.

223
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:41,040
First, you see things this way and then that way and then that way and that way, but you see things better and better.

224
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,719
And what does that mean?

225
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:57,040
I think that means for Nietzsche, you see more the richness, the complexity, and finally the excitement and wonder of whatever it is worlds that you're getting into from that.

226
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,800
So that's, I'm glad you asked.

227
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,320
I'm not sure that's a good answer, but at least I'm not embarrassed by it now.

228
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,799
When I listen to myself, if I do, I may discover that I should have said something else.

229
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,759
If so, I'll tell you, unless anybody else already knows some other thing.

230
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,839
I mean, again, that's what did I just do, by the way?

231
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,080
I tried to get back to the phenomenon again.

232
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:36,239
What you want with power is not a definition of power, but examples of power, of the minimal but still good kind of power, like infatuations and brief habits, and the maximum, namely, like artists, I didn't mention that, but artists create whole worlds.

233
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:48,159
Like, we'll go back to Picasso's power to paint everything blue and then to paint everything cubes, and presumably he has new eyes each time and sees everything blue and sees everything cubes.

234
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,640
That's the phenomenon that Nietzsche is calling power.

235
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,560
Never mind what it's called.

236
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:08,640
The point is to see that that's what he really thinks he can make the highest value by saying that's what all being is.

237
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,040
Finally, he generalizes not just living things, but everything is will to power.

238
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:21,839
And it's either a will to power that's really doing a great job, or it's wet, weak, and decadent.

239
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,239
Now, okay?

240
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:29,400
Now, but I've gotten to myself into a place where I want to change the order of the lecture altogether.

241
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:30,840
Maybe not.

242
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,799
Maybe I can connect.

243
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:53,319
So now, well, I'm going to talk about how the free spirit relates to their own passions, which is, because that's sort of, you can consider that the sensuous side or the dark side, the finite and the temporal, the body, all that gets put on one side of the self by various people.

244
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,159
You can call that the earthy side if you like it.

245
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:00,519
You can call it the dark side if you don't like it.

246
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:10,039
But there's something about being embodied in the world, which we want to know what the free spirit does with that.

247
00:22:10,999 --> 00:22:15,319
Or here's another way to put it, connecting up with the way I got into this.

248
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:35,959
If contentment and peace and equilibrium are not what we should aim at as the way ourselves, as we relate ourselves to ourselves, to talk like Kierkegaard, what should we aim at when we relate ourselves to ourselves?

249
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:38,039
That's what I want to talk about.

250
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,640
There are lots of different stories, and we've had several of them.

251
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,959
I'm constantly rewriting this.

252
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,280
It's probably going to get me in trouble.

253
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,159
But I want to start with where I was going to end up.

254
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:53,799
That is, so you'll see what the question means.

255
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,600
So, in Plato, how does the self relate itself to itself?

256
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:08,080
Remember the Greek method, the relate itself to itself by a negative relation, which means repress half.

257
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:18,880
And in the case of Plato and the Greeks that we're caring about, it means repress the temporal, finite, embodied half.

258
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,360
But what I'm talking about here is just repression.

259
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:29,600
The self relates itself to itself by denying half the self and claiming it's only essentially the mind.

260
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:33,600
That's now what's the next one?

261
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,799
Well, the next one we've also had, this is a kind of review.

262
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:45,279
There's the Christian way of dealing with the sensuous, embodied, and earthy side.

263
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,239
And what is that?

264
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,360
Well, definitely not repression.

265
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,279
I mean, that's what happens if you do that.

266
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,839
You come out like Yvonne and eventually go crazy.

267
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,959
So, Zosima tells Mrs.

268
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:03,039
Holokoff what to do.

269
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:19,759
Remember, it's you have to look at the dark side and face it honestly and integrate it into what you're doing and in effect sublimate it.

270
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,839
That is, turn it into something positive.

271
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,800
And that's the Christian proposal.

272
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,479
And how do you sublimate it?

273
00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:31,199
Well, I think you need agape.

274
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,439
Somebody has to love you with agape love in order to enable you to do it.

275
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:36,880
Zosima doesn't say that.

276
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,039
I think that's because he's too close to it.

277
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,400
He just does it.

278
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:58,919
And what you'll get out of that is purity, joy, harmony, something like that, which is still a kind of peace, but it's a very, it's not a contentment kind of peace.

279
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,079
It's a much more intense kind of peace.

280
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:11,240
So remember that there's two kinds of purity involved.

281
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:16,120
This turns out to be a kind of review, which is a good idea at this near the end of the course.

282
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,679
The purity of Plato is you just deny the impurities.

283
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:27,479
That's the, you sort of take yourself to the dry cleaners version of cleanliness and purity.

284
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:54,039
But then the Christian version in Zosima, the good Christian version, Kierkegaard thinks there's, Nietzsche thinks there's a bad Christian version, which leads the, I don't know whether I'm going to get back to it today now or not, but I'll say there's a bad Christian version which could be put with the Plato version, which wants to get rid of the part of the self that it doesn't like.

285
00:25:54,040 --> 00:26:09,080
And that goes from the Bible saying if your eye offends you, cast it out, to Christian, almost saints and so forth, who take it so literally that they castrate themselves.

286
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,759
This is what Origen, a famous church father, did.

287
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:16,999
That's like repression on a ferocious scale.

288
00:26:17,719 --> 00:26:24,200
And interestingly enough, he's therefore disqualified from being a saint.

289
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:33,319
You're not supposed to actually get rid of these sensuous impulses.

290
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:50,799
You're supposed to purify them, not in the sense of getting all the dirt out, like dry cleaning, but remember, again, transform it, sublimate it, turn the impulsive side into impulsiveness to do the good.

291
00:26:50,800 --> 00:27:01,919
But if you got all the energy that goes into these impulses, you have to be able to transform it into positive energy.

292
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,880
And Dmitri does it through his love of Grushenka.

293
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:13,199
And she can return the love because she's been loved by Alyosha.

294
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:15,279
We know that story.

295
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:20,559
So now the interesting question for today: well, what has Nietzsche got to say about this?

296
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:37,519
As usual, you can expect Nietzsche, being the absolutely original and brilliant character that he is, having taken on the most hard job he possibly can to invent new values for his culture now that God is dead, that's a pretty big job.

297
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:46,239
He's going to have to have a new story, a totally new story, about how the self gets related to itself.

298
00:27:46,239 --> 00:27:51,199
And that's going to be by command.

299
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:56,239
The self has to be able to command itself.

300
00:27:56,239 --> 00:28:00,799
Now, that was supposed to be the end, but in fact, I jumped ahead.

301
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,959
Now let's see what that means.

302
00:28:02,959 --> 00:28:08,239
So your passions are, to begin with, chaotic.

303
00:28:08,239 --> 00:28:11,200
If they're just chaotic, it makes you weak.

304
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:18,640
So you've got to be able to sort of bring them into some kind of order.

305
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,640
One way is to get rid of the bad ones.

306
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,679
That's the Greek and wrong Christian way.

307
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:27,640
One way is to sublimate the dangerous.

308
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,199
That's the Christian way.

309
00:28:30,199 --> 00:28:33,079
But then there's something else you can do.

310
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:40,759
Now I have to find the pages from the other end, so to speak, where I am, and see what I want to read.

311
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:42,200
Oh, back up one.

312
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,039
Just on 53.

313
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,239
I just want to, I'm sticking with the Christian for one more moment.

314
00:28:51,719 --> 00:29:02,439
The beginning of the aphorism 3 of Twilight on page 53 is: the spiritualization of sensuality is called love.

315
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:05,880
It's a great triumph over Christianity.

316
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,239
But you've got to be careful.

317
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:14,520
I mean, that means, I've got to explain this, otherwise what I've been saying will confuse you.

318
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:15,959
There's two stories.

319
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:19,880
I've been saying it, but I haven't done it right yet.

320
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:26,519
Christianity has in it a good version and a bad version of how the self should relate itself to itself.

321
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:29,800
The bad version is to get rid of what's bad.

322
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,959
That's at the bottom of 52.

323
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:36,599
The church combats the passions with excision in every sense of the word.

324
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:39,240
Its practice is the cure is castration.

325
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,480
That's he's thinking of origin.

326
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:52,280
It was at all times laid emphasis of its discipline on extrapolation of sensuality, of pride, lust, power, avarice, and so forth.

327
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,599
That the attack of passions at their roots means an attack on life at its roots.

328
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:59,800
The practice of a Christian is hostile to life.

329
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:06,439
Well, that's the Farrapont Christian to take the extreme, or the Yvonne Christian to take the most.

330
00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:09,119
Well, Yvonne isn't a Christian, so never mind.

331
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:22,800
So it's in Dostoevsky, I guess Ferrapont may be the only one who's living on locusts and starving himself and in general trying to get rid of the earth side of himself.

332
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:31,600
But then there's the other side of Christianity, and it's that's going to confuse you all.

333
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:46,000
Here, he's still talking against that kind of Christianity when he says on three, the spiritualization of sensuality is called love, it is a great triumph over Christianity.

334
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:48,000
Well, that you've got to read that.

335
00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:54,560
That's Dostoevsky Christianity, is a big triumph over Ferrapont Christianity.

336
00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:02,800
The Christianity that says get rid of your dark side is very bad news and it's decadent and life-destroying.

337
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:12,559
But there is another kind of Christianity which says that through agape love, you can take your sensuality and make something positive out of it.

338
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,160
That's not what he's saying here.

339
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,000
He's still attacking what he thinks is the bad Christianity.

340
00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:20,800
But we'll get to the good Christianity before long.

341
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,800
I can't quite jump to it yet because it will only confuse things if I do.

342
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:30,479
But we're looking for, don't lose track.

343
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,160
I'm losing track, sort of, trying to reinvent as I go.

344
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:59,400
Don't lose track that we're trying to get now a focus on what Nietzsche thinks, which is, and I just keep reviewing, he doesn't like the castration kind of Christianity, and he doesn't like, oh, he likes, but not, it's not for him, the spiritualizing by way of love, the Dostoevsky kind of Christianity.

345
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:04,040
He's got something else to propose.

346
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:16,840
So it's not, neither the extirpation nor the sublimation is how a free spirit relates to his or her passions.

347
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,839
You shouldn't get rid of your dark side.

348
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:28,680
You shouldn't become, you shouldn't purify it by loving and looking at it until it becomes loving and harmonious.

349
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,360
Now comes what should you do?

350
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:53,080
You organize your passions so that the chaos of your passions, which would destroy you if you were just sort of running off in all directions of lower immediacy, like a child for everything you desired, you constrain the passions, but not by repressing them, but by preserving them all in a dynamic and unstable unity.

351
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:55,320
That's what makes you powerful and creative.

352
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,919
That's the new idea.

353
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:09,640
You want to be a self which preserves and even strengthens, but also controls all the most evil and destructive passions.

354
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:11,080
Not get rid of them.

355
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:12,519
They give you energy.

356
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:15,000
They give you originality.

357
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:17,640
They're a part of life.

358
00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:18,999
So now we have to read that.

359
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:25,240
I think that's a fascinating story that Nietzsche has come up with, a new notion.

360
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,640
Where are we going to find it?

361
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:31,080
About eight lines down on 54 in Twilight.

362
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:34,439
We adopt the same attitude toward the enemy within.

363
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,159
One is, now he's going to talk about what he wants to be.

364
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,520
One is fruitful at the cost of being rich in contradictions.

365
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,080
One remains young only on condition that the soul does not relax.

366
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:48,879
Again, no peace, no contentment, no equilibrium.

367
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:50,400
Does not long for peace.

368
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,680
That's the bad guy.

369
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:57,200
Nothing is growing more alien to us than that desideratum of former times, peace of soul.

370
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,119
The Christian deserves erotum.

371
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:04,479
Nothing arouses less envy in us than the moral cow and the fat contentment of the good conscience.

372
00:34:04,479 --> 00:34:07,919
That's the ones he insults is the English ones.

373
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,360
And so forth.

374
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,320
But he's got to spell that out a lot more.

375
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,120
So we're going to spell it out a lot more.

376
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,079
And now I'm going to find out where to spell it out.

377
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,679
It's sort of scattered all over.

378
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,479
I wish I could give you a reading of it.

379
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:24,959
I'm just going to pick it out where I can find it.

380
00:34:24,959 --> 00:34:26,079
It's all on your list.

381
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:34,400
And a lot of them you've read, but some of them you haven't because I spent the morning trying to find every reference I could to this idea.

382
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,919
Remember the idea now?

383
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:38,240
Control of chaos.

384
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:49,520
Bringing under your control all the evil as well as the good, all the sensual as well as the purely spiritual.

385
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:51,919
That's what he's going to try to tell you about.

386
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:55,600
So you want to establish something.

387
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:57,680
Okay, here they are.

388
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,279
No, that's not it yet.

389
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,439
Okay, try this one.

390
00:35:01,439 --> 00:35:02,719
76 in what?

391
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:04,000
Twilight?

392
00:35:03,999 --> 00:35:04,479
Maybe.

393
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:09,919
I haven't, that's not what I'm looking for now, but it may well be what I was looking for, will be looking for sooner or later.

394
00:35:09,919 --> 00:35:11,679
76 in Twilight?

395
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,000
Page 76?

396
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:17,120
Aphorism 6.

397
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,719
On 76.

398
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,639
Gee, no, maybe I missed that one.

399
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:21,760
I think that's very hopeful.

400
00:35:21,999 --> 00:35:22,759
What are you see there?

401
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,560
I've been tracking the eye to report locations to let anything cost bread.

402
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:31,880
Learning to defer judgment with that given control.

403
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:33,880
I don't see it yet about control.

404
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,199
I see.

405
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,320
I'm learning to see.

406
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,279
Oh, I see where you are.

407
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,280
The middle of aphorism 6.

408
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:42,840
As I understand it, is almost what is called in unphilosophical language strong willpower.

409
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,039
Yeah, that sounds hopeful.

410
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:51,720
The essence of it is precisely not to will the ability, not to will, the ability to defer decisions.

411
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,560
Okay, let's skip a little.

412
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:57,239
No, I mean, there's nothing wrong with this, but I see why I didn't mark it.

413
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:19,480
Because that is, I want to say, what's interesting about the Nietzsche version is that he wants to preserve what's dangerous, what's evil, what's destructive, and not purify it and sublimate it and not surely not repress it, but control it, make it part of your life.

414
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:22,439
I'll get clearer about that as I go.

415
00:36:22,999 --> 00:36:30,919
Now I'm looking for page 237, and maybe I thought I should be looking.

416
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:32,760
No, not on 237.

417
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:34,040
Okay.

418
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,679
Well, I don't know what in the world I have in mind.

419
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,599
One more possibility, but I don't think it's.

420
00:36:38,919 --> 00:36:42,520
But there is, in will to power, you have to add it.

421
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:48,439
I didn't have time to add it to the handout, but I'll just read it to you because it's relevant here.

422
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:53,240
Domination of the passions is not their weakening or extirpation.

423
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:58,200
The greater the dominating power of the will, the more freedom may the passions be allowed.

424
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:07,400
The great man is great owing to the free play and scope of his desires and to the yet greater power that knows how to press these magnificent monsters into service.

425
00:37:07,999 --> 00:37:09,679
That's the line.

426
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:18,640
So everybody's got monstrous side of them, crazy desires and impulses and so forth.

427
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:28,400
And the point is not to deny them and get rid of them or even transform them, but be strong enough to have them under control.

428
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,479
That's the monsters that you press.

429
00:37:30,479 --> 00:37:31,520
What is it again?

430
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:38,159
The kind of you have to know how to press the magnificent monsters into service.

431
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:41,280
That's good nature.

432
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,040
So certainly such a person wouldn't have peace.

433
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:47,200
They wouldn't even have equilibrium.

434
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,880
They would be constantly sort of struggling to keep it all together.

435
00:37:53,519 --> 00:38:05,040
And the idea that the more powerful desires, even the destructive ones, that they can keep under control and make some positive use of, the better.

436
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:05,439
Yeah.

437
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,639
No, well, it shouldn't.

438
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:15,760
That's my fault.

439
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,400
I mean, it shouldn't be integrated.

440
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,919
That's the word I don't want to say.

441
00:38:19,919 --> 00:38:21,919
You keep the dark side.

442
00:38:21,919 --> 00:38:23,999
You don't, what did you say?

443
00:38:23,999 --> 00:38:25,199
You do something to it.

444
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,680
You don't transform it.

445
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,559
Okay, let me, okay, let me try.

446
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:32,800
Let's try a phenomenon or two.

447
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:43,439
Suppose you are a generally aggressive person, and your first impulse, whenever anything isn't going the way it is, is to hit somebody or something.

448
00:38:43,439 --> 00:38:48,640
Now, one way to do is to try to get rid of that.

449
00:38:48,639 --> 00:39:02,439
Another one would be to try to transform it into something else, but you could just try to use it on appropriate occasions in the sense that go in for martial arts or join the army.

450
00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:06,199
Do something where you can make a virtue.

451
00:39:06,200 --> 00:40:34,480
of what if you're say a professor would certainly be a vice if you go around hitting students or something but if you're if you're in the army you can go around hitting the enemy so so the idea is find a way that you can actually manage to uh keep that impulse but be under control you can't go around hitting everybody your your children and your wife however that this there's something right about this impulse to to strike out and try to annihilate people and things you don't like don't get rid of that impulse just bring it to bear as best you can on the situations when it's appropriate and then in another situation some other dark impulse may be appropriate let's say you want to impress people and so I mean you're you're you're egoistic and you want them all to think how great you are okay well there's opportunities for that to become an actor perhaps maybe a professor I'm not sure but in any case there again don't get rid of this impulse to impress people but try to control it so that it doesn't come out on the wrong occasions of course, that's risky you if you really sort of knock it out so much that you control it and it's so peaceful that you know it'll never come out on the wrong occasions, you weakened it too much.

452
00:40:34,479 --> 00:40:45,200
You may just have to hit somebody sometimes, risk hitting people who you really wish you hadn't hit, or trying to impress people that you really wish you had just listened to.

453
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,400
Okay, I see a hand up here.

454
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:46,800
Go ahead.

455
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,079
Okay, well, I see that.

456
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,039
I mean, I don't know.

457
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,520
She's asking, yeah, what about people who really have pathological impulses?

458
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:10,480
Well, they're weak and self-destructive people because this isn't increasing their power and constantly giving them more and more of a grip and able to open up new worlds.

459
00:41:10,479 --> 00:41:12,720
This is just going off in all directions.

460
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,120
He certainly thinks that's a bad idea.

461
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:18,479
And that means they haven't got control of their impulses.

462
00:41:18,479 --> 00:41:24,160
The trick is to have these impulses and get control of them instead of getting rid of them.

463
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:29,199
And the more you can get control of them without weakening them, the better.

464
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:42,160
But if you go too far in her direction, and instead of weakening them, you just let them ride run you, that's going too far in the other direction.

465
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,120
And how do you do it right?

466
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,519
Well, you just have to have a feel for it.

467
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,080
If you're a healthy free spirit type, you'll know how to do it.

468
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:59,040
And if you aren't, you're sick and decadent, and nature will just think you're good riddance if you just fall apart.

469
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,400
Okay, yeah.

470
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:11,680
I think it's appropriate to act on when the masses will have an opinion, but of course the free spirit won't go with the masses' opinion.

471
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,680
The only person who decides when it's appropriate, finally, is the free spirit.

472
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:24,360
And the only way to determine, and what makes it appropriate, not whether it makes people happy and like you or something like that.

473
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:34,359
Again, it's appropriate if it gives you creativity, if it gives you new ways of seeing things and new ways of doing things, then you're doing it right.

474
00:42:34,999 --> 00:42:41,479
And the important thing is there isn't any general standard of how it's appropriate.

475
00:42:41,479 --> 00:42:42,679
I mean, you're right about that.

476
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:47,880
The general standard of what's appropriate is exactly what Nietzsche thinks is dangerous.

477
00:42:47,880 --> 00:43:02,520
It levels down and represses and takes away the importance of this seemingly evil, but if properly directed, powerful impulse guide.

478
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:11,799
Okay, I'm going to go on because there are quotes that help a lot, because they're all looking not very, not sort of aha, and isn't that interesting, so I must have to do it better.

479
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:13,240
Let's see.

480
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:20,840
Well, here's one about being like a tree on 331 of gay science.

481
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,799
It's only a metaphor, but maybe it will help.

482
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,959
It's on 331, we incomprehensible ones.

483
00:43:29,959 --> 00:43:33,159
Have we ever complained because we are misunderstood and so forth?

484
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,919
No, no, that we haven't.

485
00:43:34,919 --> 00:43:37,080
We've, and so forth.

486
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:39,159
We keep growing and changing and so forth.

487
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,320
That's not what I want to read right now.

488
00:43:42,919 --> 00:43:48,120
We push, I'll start at the very bottom of the 331.

489
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:53,080
We push our roots ever more powerfully into the depths, into evil.

490
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,919
That's the crucial part.

491
00:43:54,919 --> 00:44:03,800
While at the same time, we embrace the heavens ever more lovingly, more broadly, imbibing their light ever more thirstily with all our twigs and branches.

492
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,640
Now that's really interesting.

493
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:09,520
You see how that's related to Dmitry and the brothers?

494
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:20,959
Dimitri's got this problem about the evil, going into the pit of Sodom, but heels up and head first, and at the same time, beginning a prayer or a song.

495
00:44:20,959 --> 00:44:22,800
I think it's a prayer to the Madonna.

496
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,080
And Dimitri thinks that's too broad.

497
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,080
He wants to get rid of that.

498
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:35,599
And Dostoevsky thinks that Dmitry will get rid of it finally when he gets enough agape love for Maliasha and Grushenka.

499
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,480
He won't have that problem anymore.

500
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,600
The self won't be too broad and stretch between contradictions.

501
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,959
He'll get the two aspects in harmony.

502
00:44:46,959 --> 00:44:51,840
But Dostoevsky thinks that no, now let's go on.

503
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,159
It's not getting them into harmony.

504
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:58,560
It's getting more and more into the heavens.

505
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:01,200
That's the Madonna stuff.

506
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,400
And the evil.

507
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,320
That's the Sodom stuff.

508
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,519
And like a tree we grow.

509
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:08,639
This is hard to understand.

510
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:09,919
This is all of life.

511
00:45:09,919 --> 00:45:11,840
Not in one place only, but everywhere.

512
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,919
Not in one direction, but upward and outward and inward and downward.

513
00:45:15,919 --> 00:45:17,759
That's the evil side.

514
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,080
Our energy is at work simultaneously in the trunk, the branches, the roots.

515
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,959
We are no longer free to do only one particular thing to be one particular thing.

516
00:45:26,959 --> 00:45:29,599
Okay, that's another way to do it, to say it.

517
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:32,159
And I've got others scattered around.

518
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:40,240
Things are not totally uncontrolled, but we get the positive force of all our impulses.

519
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:51,320
This means dealing openly with the more unsavory aspects of ourselves and find room for them by establishing this hierarchy of control.

520
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:56,680
That is, sort of, some of your impulses are used to control other impulses.

521
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:59,559
You've got to, and it's you that have to organize that.

522
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,159
And the free spirit is able to organize that.

523
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,919
That's how he relates himself or she relates herself to themselves.

524
00:46:06,919 --> 00:46:07,079
Yeah.

525
00:46:16,999 --> 00:46:17,959
That's right.

526
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,119
We sort of don't cut them off.

527
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:28,919
That's this extirpation, castration, platonic, you know, negative R2, get rid of half of the self.

528
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:30,280
You don't do that.

529
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:39,239
You keep the roots that are going down, and you even sort of promote the roots that are going down, but you don't let them pull you down.

530
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,479
Instead, they hold you up.

531
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:58,679
You convert all this into a kind of impulses that you control enough so that they come out in situations where they are appropriate in some way and not in other situations.

532
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,280
But you don't get rid of them.

533
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:04,040
That's again how different from what?

534
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:04,919
No, no.

535
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:06,039
Look at Dimitri.

536
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:17,720
You want to say to Dimitri, you don't want to say to Dimitri in Dostoevsky, well, keep the sodom side, the kinky sex and the nasty way he's been relating to women.

537
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,680
Just keep it, but only do it on appropriate occasions.

538
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:24,120
That's not quite right.

539
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:29,479
It's something like, how are we going to do it now?

540
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:30,839
I've got myself into this.

541
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:50,799
I can't think of the appropriate occasion that or the way of life where you could control these impulses, not get rid of them, but make them give up their energy to you, help you in some way to be a strong person.

542
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,599
Well, you got in health here?

543
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,879
We need to have experience with developers?

544
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,400
That's right.

545
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:09,360
Not only do you need to experience them and face them, and then you never will actually act on them, but they will gradually go away and become other impulses.

546
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:14,879
That's the sublimation thing, impulses toward rushing recklessly to help people out and so forth.

547
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,479
That's the Dostoevsky picture.

548
00:48:16,479 --> 00:48:19,439
In Nietzsche, they stay evil.

549
00:48:19,439 --> 00:48:21,200
They stay deep.

550
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:27,120
They stay down in your unconscious where you've got all kinds of strange and weird impulses.

551
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:38,319
And if you're enough of an artist and enough of a free free spirit, these impulses still give you energy.

552
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,999
I can't really explain in some detail how, but that's the picture.

553
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:46,720
Somehow they'll be there, not denied.

554
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:48,400
If I keep going, who knows?

555
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,599
I might get it better.

556
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:50,719
So let's try.

557
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:52,000
Let's see.

558
00:48:51,999 --> 00:48:53,839
Okay, well, that's the best I can do.

559
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:59,360
So for Nietzsche, you don't, a free spirit is not like a Dostoevsky and saint.

560
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:14,240
A free spirit is like an artist who manages to make something positive out of their, even out of their pinky ways of looking at things.

561
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,999
There's an artist named Balthus.

562
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:27,959
He's a famous, good artist who only seems to be interested in painting very young adolescent girls, but he paints them very well, and his paintings are in major museums.

563
00:49:28,439 --> 00:49:35,720
And that sort of kinky side of him presumably takes the place of his actually molesting the girls.

564
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,599
But he's not denied that impulse.

565
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:44,600
He's controlled it and found a way to make it a positive source of creativity.

566
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:46,280
That's the best I can do.

567
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:50,040
So I'm going to go on because there's another thing I want to cover.

568
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:52,919
I don't know whether I'll get, but I want to make sure.

569
00:49:52,919 --> 00:50:00,600
And if anybody wants to say anything more about this, I think that it's very interesting and challenging.

570
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:02,679
And I went around trying to find more quotes.

571
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:03,959
I'm sure there are more quotes.

572
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:17,800
If anybody comes across or knows any more where Nietzsche explains this more, I asked Hans Slug, who's our Nietzsche guy, and he feels too that there's more in Will to Power, for instance, which you don't have, but I could only find one.

573
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:34,840
Anyway, there's a picture there that Nietzsche's trying to work out of a, let me just sum up, of a view of the way the self relates to itself, which is not extirpation of half the self, and it's not turning it into something else by sublimation.

574
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:38,279
It's control and making it work for you.

575
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,799
That's all I can do with it.

576
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,279
But think of your own examples.

577
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,959
Come and tell me in office hours.

578
00:50:43,959 --> 00:50:44,999
I'm going on.

579
00:50:44,999 --> 00:50:57,400
I want to talk about Christianity and Jesus because I said before that Jesus would be for Nietzsche a free thinker, or almost a free thinker.

580
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,559
And now I owe you an explanation of that.

581
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:03,320
It's really fascinating and very relevant to the Course.

582
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:07,079
So there's, again, Nietzsche's so complicated.

583
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:24,319
There is Jesus the Redeemer, as he calls him, which I think he picks that name because I take it the Redeemer is the one who suffers on the cross for everybody and thereby pays off the debt that was caused by original sin.

584
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:31,199
The thing that I think Dostoevsky can't understand and can't existentialize, and neither can I, and neither can Nietzsche.

585
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,959
Nietzsche is very much against that understanding.

586
00:51:34,959 --> 00:51:40,000
But I'm not even going to read the part where Nietzsche is sort of railing against that understanding.

587
00:51:39,999 --> 00:51:46,480
I want to read the part where, in more general terms, he's against the Redeemer.

588
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:50,640
On 150, now I'm in the Antichrist from now on.

589
00:51:50,639 --> 00:52:00,320
So at the bottom of 152, Aphorism 29, he says, What I'm concerned with is the psychological type of the Redeemer.

590
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:04,400
And then he goes on saying how much he's against that.

591
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:10,079
And he, well, that's the general heading.

592
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:16,480
I don't want to read the next thing I thought I wanted to read, because I think it's too confusing.

593
00:52:16,479 --> 00:52:23,600
But what, now we want to find out more about this story about Jesus.

594
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:34,160
So he's asked the question: well, is he really this Redeemer, this suffering servant and so forth?

595
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,760
And he thinks he's not.

596
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:41,600
He says on page 154, number 31, I've anticipated my answer to the problem.

597
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:45,840
I mean, the problem is: how are we supposed to understand Jesus?

598
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:48,400
Is he the Redeemer or is He something else?

599
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:57,880
It's presupposition is the type of the Red Redeemer has been preserved to us only in a distorted form.

600
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:07,560
So he's going to say, well, Jesus is doing something very interesting and important, except it was so world-transforming that nobody could understand it.

601
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:14,119
So we've got this kind of very confused account of it in the letters of Paul and in the Gospel.

602
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,040
That's what he's going to say.

603
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:21,959
So now the bottom of 154, about eight lines down.

604
00:53:21,959 --> 00:53:33,639
That strange and sick world to which the Gospels introduce us, a world like that of the Russian novel, in which the refuse of society, neurosis, and childlike idiocy seem to make a rendezvous.

605
00:53:33,639 --> 00:53:39,400
That's why people think he's read Dostoevsky The Idiot, must, in any case, have coarsened the type.

606
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:49,880
The first disciples in particular had to translate a being immersed entirely in symbols and incomprehensibility into their own crudity in order to understand anything at all.

607
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:54,439
For them, such a type could not exist until it had been reduced to more familiar terms.

608
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:55,720
You recognize that.

609
00:53:56,039 --> 00:53:56,840
You should be used to it.

610
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:10,520
The first stage of Christianity, Nietzsche thinks, turns out Dostoevsky also thinks, with Marko, is so revolutionary, so new world-defining, that the disciples can't understand it.

611
00:54:12,039 --> 00:54:13,320
And neither can Jesus.

612
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,680
He doesn't say that, but it's implied nobody can understand it.

613
00:54:17,079 --> 00:54:22,120
But Jesus can only describe it in incomprehensible parables and so forth.

614
00:54:22,119 --> 00:54:26,439
And because there's no familiar form, that's why it has to go into the monastery.

615
00:54:26,439 --> 00:54:29,160
But that's Dostoevsky.

616
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:34,840
And then we get to the real Jesus.

617
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,999
That's what I wanted to be sure and get to today.

618
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:48,320
That's Nietzsche trying to see what Jesus must have been like, even though the disciples couldn't understand what he was doing, and even he couldn't explain what he was doing.

619
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:55,280
So, and then it looks like Jesus is a free spirit on 156.

620
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,080
That's about ten lines from the bottom.

621
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:01,919
One could, with some freedom of expression, call Jesus a free spirit.

622
00:55:01,919 --> 00:55:03,520
And now, why would that be?

623
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:06,320
Well, he cares nothing for what is fixed.

624
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,919
The word killeth.

625
00:55:07,919 --> 00:55:09,840
Everything fixed, killeth.

626
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:19,600
That is, he's making him into somebody who believes in constant overcoming and doesn't want to get stuck with a universal, fixed, ethical law.

627
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:21,359
And he doesn't like the law.

628
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:25,200
He thinks he's fulfilled and surpassed the law.

629
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:34,160
So the concept of the expression life in the only form he knows it is opposed to any kind of word, formula, law, faith, dogma.

630
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:38,240
He speaks only of the inmost thing, life.

631
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,160
All this about eternal life.

632
00:55:40,479 --> 00:55:55,199
Now, but Nietzsche thinks that when he said eternal, he didn't mean eternal the way Plato would have meant it or even the people who talked about childhood memories like Dostoevsky or Kierkegaard.

633
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:55,919
None of them.

634
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:59,200
He speaks about, because he talks about eternal life.

635
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:07,200
And everything, the whole of reality, the whole of nature, language possesses for him the value of a sign, a metaphor.

636
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:11,119
On this point, we must be absolutely no mistake, and so forth.

637
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:12,959
I can skip for a while.

638
00:56:12,959 --> 00:56:15,120
He's sort of affirming everything.

639
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:20,919
So, skipping down to where it says denial in the italics on the next page in the middle of that.

640
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:24,199
Denial is precisely what is totally impossible for anyone.

641
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,760
Dialectics are likewise lacking.

642
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,360
The idea is lacking.

643
00:56:28,439 --> 00:56:32,520
The idea is lacking that a faith, a truth, could be proved by reasons.

644
00:56:32,519 --> 00:56:38,839
His proofs are inner lights, inner feelings of pleasure and self-affirmation, nothing but proofs of potency.

645
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:43,080
So, he's feeling his own power, according to Nietzsche, making him up.

646
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:51,000
And now, the other important thing is that he understands that we're in paradise here and now.

647
00:56:50,999 --> 00:56:55,800
So, that's in 33, aphorism 33 and 157.

648
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:01,160
Blessedness is not promised, it's not tied to any conditions, it's the only reality.

649
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:04,520
The rest is signs for speaking of it.

650
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:12,600
And then he doesn't fight back when people do bad things to him.

651
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:21,480
And in the end, it turns out that it sounds pretty much like Dostoevsky what he's done.

652
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:30,119
He says, He settled, and I'm now on page 158, the second sentence in the first full paragraph.

653
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:34,280
He's settled his account with the whole Jewish penance and reconciliation doctrine.

654
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:41,160
He knows that it's through the practice of one's life that one feels divine, blessed, evangelic at all times, child of God.

655
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:44,999
It's not penance, not prayer for forgiveness, which leads to God.

656
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,880
Evangelical practice alone leads to God.

657
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,240
It is God.

658
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:58,679
So God is sort of experiencing the glad tidings, and the glad tidings is that we're all in heaven here and now.

659
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,719
That's the last paragraph.

660
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:11,280
The profound instinct of how one could have to live in order to feel oneself in heaven, to feel oneself eternal, while in every other condition, one by no means feels oneself in heaven.

661
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,119
This alone is the psychological reality of redemption.

662
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:17,519
That's the positive, right kind of redeemer.

663
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:20,719
A new way of living, not a new belief.

664
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:23,119
And it's sort of like the ocean of love.

665
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:26,800
It's the next, about 10 lines down on 159.

666
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:37,359
In a word, in the word son, S-O-N is expressed the entry into the collective feeling of the transfiguration of all things.

667
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:40,879
I mean, this is the world being totally transformed by love.

668
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:45,840
In the word Father, this feeling is the feeling of perfection and eternity.

669
00:58:46,479 --> 00:58:50,480
And he says, I'm ashamed of what the church has made of this symbolism.

670
00:58:50,479 --> 00:58:59,839
Well, he's trying to make it, Nietzsche is trying to make it, some kind of shared feeling of power and life, I take it.

671
00:59:01,439 --> 00:59:05,119
And the glad tidings are that you should live this way.

672
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:14,400
On 35, aphorism 35, 159, the bringer of glad tidings died as he lived, as he taught, not to redeem mankind.

673
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,720
That's the everything sacrificed on the cross.

674
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,159
That's the Dimitri thing.

675
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,160
I'm suffering for everybody.

676
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,800
But to demonstrate how one ought to live.

677
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,639
That's the incarnation side.

678
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:37,120
What he's bequeathed to mankind is his practice, his bearing before the judges, before the guards, before the accusers, his bearing on the cross, and so forth.

679
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:44,160
And that's all something that Nietzsche seems to admire.

680
00:59:44,479 --> 00:59:48,559
So we've got to ask the question now, pretty soon.

681
00:59:49,160 --> 01:00:08,120
So, well, why isn't Jesus, if he understands that we're in heaven here and now, if he understands that the law is a bad thing, that you have to completely invent yourself, if he turns out to be giving us a whole new set of values and opening up a new world, why isn't he just a free spirit?

682
01:00:08,119 --> 01:00:09,079
What's wrong with him?

683
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:13,239
Nietzsche never says what's wrong with him, but you ought to be able to figure it out.

684
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,800
Let me see if I need to read anything else.

685
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,840
Now, I think, yeah, I think that's it.

686
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:28,120
But now, what is it that he's got wrong, according to?

687
01:00:28,599 --> 01:00:34,119
If you were finishing what Nietzsche is thinking, because he says he's almost a free spirit.

688
01:00:34,119 --> 01:00:53,719
He's the last, let's get remember, he's the last of the Christian free spirits because the disciples misunderstood him, thought he was talking about in another world where in heaven there would be bliss and another eternity, where he's really talking about the kind of power you can have.

689
01:00:54,039 --> 01:01:04,600
It won't be agape love, of course, the kind of aliveness and power you can have right now in this world if you get outside the law, if you would start inventing new things.

690
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:09,720
That's what he really came to tell people.

691
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:12,600
But there's something that he's got wrong.

692
01:01:12,999 --> 01:01:14,679
Yeah, that's good.

693
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:15,239
That's good.

694
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:16,119
You're right on.

695
01:01:16,119 --> 01:01:16,919
Exactly.

696
01:01:16,919 --> 01:01:18,039
That's the trouble.

697
01:01:18,039 --> 01:01:24,119
Nietzsche doesn't say it as if it's his trouble, but he does say that there is, he doesn't resist the top of 160.

698
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:25,400
He doesn't defend his rights.

699
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,639
He takes no steps to avert the worst.

700
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,079
And so forth.

701
01:01:29,079 --> 01:01:31,479
He turns the other cheek, he says at another point.

702
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:33,799
Of course, that's the Christian words for it.

703
01:01:35,079 --> 01:01:44,559
And so he says at the end of that, not to defend yourself, not to grow angry, not to make responsible, but not to resist even the evil man to love him.

704
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:49,919
He says that as if he likes it, but he obviously wouldn't like it, as you say.

705
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:55,760
And that's one of the things that he's got against, would have against it.

706
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:01,039
The other that he never, I'm sure he somewhere does what I'm going to say, but I don't know where it is.

707
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:02,959
If anybody finds it, let me know.

708
01:02:02,959 --> 01:02:17,439
What would he think of Jesus's compassion for the weak and the crippled and the blind and in general, what Nietzsche would call thick and decadent people who haven't got much will to power and not much life?

709
01:02:17,919 --> 01:02:19,520
What would Jesus think of?

710
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:27,520
Well, that you shouldn't do anything with them, or if you have to, you can just wipe them out.

711
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:39,039
I wish I could suddenly open to a quote which says that we have to be tough against all the weakness in us and not just us, he says, underlining.

712
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:40,079
Do you remember that quote?

713
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:42,320
I think I'm pretty sure it's in the reading somewhere.

714
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,679
Anyway, that's it.

715
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:57,840
You'd have to be tough on your any time when you're trying to be weak, when you want to be peaceful and just rest and so forth, when your life energy is running down, you'd have to fight that.

716
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:03,200
And if there are other people who are weak and energy is running down, you've got to fight that too.

717
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:07,120
And that's the other thing that I think he thinks Jesus is doing wrong.

718
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:37,240
But one thing is sure, the only good Christian died on the cross, he says, and that's because the right things that Jesus was doing got forgotten or misunderstood, and the wrong things that he was doing, again, he doesn't say this in anything I'm quoting, but I'm sure he thinks that the wrong things about what he was doing, namely turn the other cheek and compassion for everybody, even the weakest, that's what got to be the main story about the Redeemer.

719
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:38,519
That's what he's against.

720
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:39,799
Yeah, Beatrice, good.

721
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:45,240
Just all horror finally goes out to the poor but to the other people.

722
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,400
They're not really weak in the venue.

723
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,719
They're just good.

724
01:03:49,719 --> 01:03:52,439
Well, insofar, I mean, they're two different things.

725
01:03:52,439 --> 01:03:57,639
When he saves Mary Magdalene and says, let he is guiltless, cast the first stone.

726
01:03:57,639 --> 01:04:14,759
And then that's one side of him that Nietzsche could like, that he is sort of somebody who is being falsely, badly treated, and who, but they're not really, let's assume, not weak themselves.

727
01:04:14,759 --> 01:04:19,959
But I'm talking about all the cripples and the blind and the deaf and so forth that he helps.

728
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,240
He helps everybody.

729
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:25,799
Nietzsche says himself that there's nobody that he wouldn't help out.

730
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:27,559
I just read it somewhere.

731
01:04:27,559 --> 01:04:33,559
Well, we know that, that he would help everybody, and we know that Nietzsche doesn't like it.

732
01:04:33,559 --> 01:04:44,439
The quote I would like to find is how we have to be strong and be opposed to everything that's weak, not only in ourselves, but in anybody.

733
01:04:44,439 --> 01:04:45,240
Yeah.

734
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:46,919
Ah, good.

735
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:47,400
Yeah, yeah.

736
01:04:47,400 --> 01:05:20,719
Melissa's just reminding me or us that we've got to be careful and not take the Jesus that Yvonne makes up in the Grand Inquisitor story, the extreme Protestant, super demanding Jesus who wants you to be totally free and totally individual and take all of every, you know, all the stuff that you believe without any miracles, believe without any bread, believe without any community, believe without any arguments.

737
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:23,119
You just commit yourself to Jesus.

738
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,919
That's certainly not Nietzsche's story.

739
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,360
And it's not the church, the early church's story either.

740
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:32,959
That's something that Yvonne invented.

741
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:40,959
It would be just sort of Yvonne craziness if it weren't exactly Kierkegaard.

742
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:51,839
Because Yvonne has invented this extreme Protestantism where the individual is totally free and totally responsible only before God.

743
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:53,759
It's Luther.

744
01:05:53,759 --> 01:05:57,999
I mean, Kierkegaard is extreme Luther and Yvonne is extreme.

745
01:05:59,439 --> 01:06:05,039
Jesus in the Grand Inquisitor is extreme Yvonne.

746
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,999
Okay, but it's a good thing to keep track.

747
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,879
In fact, it sounds like a good question for the exam.

748
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:12,400
I think we should remember it.

749
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:19,519
These various accounts of Christianity is something to try to keep straight and relate.

750
01:06:19,759 --> 01:06:20,879
That's the kind of thing.

751
01:06:20,879 --> 01:06:21,599
I'll stop with that.

752
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:33,999
But the kind of thing we're going to ask on the exam is how to take some concept like Christianity, I'm not sure we want to use that one, and show how it works in these various books and how they relate to each other.
