1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
So there are sort of three parts to today's lecture.

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:16,119
One is we're finishing something which we haven't really finished, which is various ways of living if you're a free spirit or on the way to getting to be a free spirit.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:22,359
And then there's a whole thing I have to talk about on nihilism before you see the movie.

4
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:25,799
And that's what you've got in the will to power handout.

5
00:00:25,799 --> 00:00:28,040
And that's the next thing I have to talk about.

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:35,240
As long as I finish those two, that's all that I really have to talk about, because then you'll be ready to see Breathless on Thursday.

7
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:47,960
But if I finish them before time is up, I'm going to start discussing the various comparisons between the three people because we only have one concluding lecture to put everything together.

8
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,919
And I don't want to waste any time.

9
00:00:50,919 --> 00:00:52,119
Okay, here we go.

10
00:00:52,119 --> 00:01:01,479
So we've seen three ways of life, which if you're a Nietzschean, you would say healthy ways of life that people can have.

11
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,720
And certainly they're all possible.

12
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,799
And they aren't incompatible.

13
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:08,999
You can have them all.

14
00:01:08,999 --> 00:01:10,760
So you have brief habits.

15
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,200
And we've done that.

16
00:01:12,199 --> 00:01:14,679
I don't want to go back over it.

17
00:01:14,679 --> 00:01:20,359
So we've done control and use the dark, conflicting impulses that you've got.

18
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:22,359
Use them in some productive way.

19
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:26,840
I'm sorry that we don't have it on the handout because I said last time, I just found it.

20
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:33,799
And now it was too late to put it on the handout, which is now on the website, by the way, the handout being the will to power.

21
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:43,239
But this nice quote from the will to power, which I read last time, sums up the way you should deal with your dark side according to Nietzsche.

22
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:55,960
I mean, remember that in Dostoevsky and Kierkegaard, there are ways to get the finite, temporal, embodied, sensuous side spiritualized and sublimated in some way.

23
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,720
That's not Nietzsche's view.

24
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:04,479
He says the highest thing is dominating the passions, not their weakening or extirpation.

25
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,960
The greater the dominating power of a will, the more freedom may the passions be allowed.

26
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,840
The passions are this dark side instinct, lower immediacy.

27
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:30,559
The great man is great owing to the free play and scope of his desires and to the yet greater power that he knows how to, the greater power that knows how to press these magnificent monsters into service.

28
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:42,319
The magnificent monsters are all these impulses, the dark side that everybody has, and that every philosophy has some story about how to deal with them.

29
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,439
Well, Nietzsche's is original, as everything is with Nietzsche.

30
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:50,880
Deal with them by keeping them under control, but don't try to get rid of them.

31
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:58,479
They're your way, one of your most important ways of being in constant impulsive involvement in the world.

32
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,759
Okay, we did that one.

33
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:10,160
Now comes another one, which we've already done, but it's this quote, which is actually in the movie.

34
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,720
So I wanted to put it in.

35
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,640
I think I wrote the page numbers wrong, but I can reconstruct it.

36
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,200
But I want to make sure that I really am wrong.

37
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:24,880
Yeah, I wrote it at Will to Power 228, but it's really gay science 228.

38
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:35,200
Yes, I read this bottom 228, but as I said then, and I'll say it again, the live dangerously comes up on a poster in the background in one of the scenes in the movie.

39
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:40,240
It's one of the evidences, if you need any evidence, that this really is a Nietzschean movie.

40
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:49,639
And it says at the bottom of 228, for believe me, the secret for harvesting from existence the greatest fruitfulness and the greatest enjoyment is to live dangerously.

41
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,280
Build your city on the slopes of Vesuvius.

42
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,999
Send your ships into uncharted seas.

43
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:57,400
Live in war with your peers and yourselves.

44
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,280
And then this line is really the relevant line.

45
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,759
Be robbers and conquerors if you can't be rulers and possessors.

46
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:12,759
That is better to be an outlaw than not to have your own power and your own activity.

47
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,199
Okay, that's so far.

48
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,239
That's all review.

49
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:22,840
Now, there's one more important way to lead a healthy life.

50
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,399
And we have, and it's an interesting one.

51
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,040
And it's a Gay Science 232.

52
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:36,519
And it's just another interesting Nietzschean idea that I don't know anybody else who has it, and it's worth looking into.

53
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,840
The middle of 232.

54
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,559
One thing is needful, to give style to one's character.

55
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:46,200
And by the way, this is also relevant to the movie.

56
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:47,479
You'll see.

57
00:04:47,479 --> 00:05:00,759
To give style to one's character, a great and rare art is practiced by those who survey all the strengths and weaknesses of their nature and fit them into an artistic pattern until every one of them appears as art and reason and even weakness delights the eye.

58
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:09,320
Here a large mass of second nature has been added, there a piece of original nature has been removed, both through long practice and daily work.

59
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:13,880
Here the ugly could not be removed, that could not be removed, is concealed.

60
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,360
There it's been interpreted and made sublime.

61
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:19,240
Much that is vague and so forth, I think we can skip that.

62
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:26,679
In the end, when the work is finished, it becomes evident how the constraint of a single taste governed and formed everything, large and small.

63
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:32,480
Whether this taste was good or bad is less important than one might suppose if only it was a single state.

64
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:39,520
It will be the strong and dominant natures that enjoy their finest gaiety and such constraint under a law of their own.

65
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,360
So you impose, you don't get anybody imposing any order on you.

66
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,240
You impose this kind of order on yourself.

67
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:59,280
It's another version of just as you impose order on your impulses so that they don't just go off in all directions, but you don't squash them either.

68
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:12,400
The control story, here you impose order on your looks and on your tastes and on your ways of behaving until they all give you a single style.

69
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:20,880
And what's interesting about the style, you notice all these proposals about how to live are not traditional ones.

70
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:29,919
They're not about how to find meaning in your life, how to make your activity intelligible so you can explain it to yourself and justify it to other people.

71
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,839
They aren't stories about how to make what you do into universal principles.

72
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,880
They break with all of that.

73
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:47,760
And there isn't any content that's being proposed, any particular ethical principles.

74
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,120
Nature doesn't believe in any particular ethical principles.

75
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:54,240
And it isn't supposed to be giving your life meaning.

76
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,120
It gives your life something aesthetic, like a painting.

77
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:08,640
But it's something admirable that you have this style unified and as beautiful as you can make it.

78
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,480
And there are two different kinds of styles, at least.

79
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,720
They're generic styles, like the style of the 50s or the style of New York.

80
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:23,080
But what Nietzsche is interested in is obviously individual styles.

81
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,160
Again, it's not universal, it's not even shared.

82
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,960
Each person can give their life their own unique style.

83
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:37,959
Like there's a unique Bogart style and Bogie in all of his different movies.

84
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,319
That's what makes a movie star.

85
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,439
They don't really merge into the characters they perform, the old Hollywood movie stars.

86
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:48,919
They were always themselves in whatever movie they were in.

87
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:53,080
And if occasionally they got off that, it didn't work out very well.

88
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:56,280
So there is certainly a Bogart style.

89
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:06,120
And Nietzsche wants to substitute this notion of individual style for any notion of universal meaning.

90
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:20,120
Whereas acting, you might think you have to do what is intelligible and everybody understands and justifies the normal ethical, the normal mediation.

91
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:22,200
You don't have to mediate a style.

92
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,840
The more individual it is, the better.

93
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,999
And everybody can appreciate it.

94
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,520
They don't have to understand it.

95
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,000
That's not what you do with styles.

96
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,760
So, and you praise people for, and artists, for unique styles.

97
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,400
Artists are his highest form of human being.

98
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:48,280
Artists are more like free spirits in the sense that they create new worlds and they create themselves.

99
00:08:48,439 --> 00:08:50,200
They create their style.

100
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:52,440
And that's all fine.

101
00:08:52,439 --> 00:08:57,720
Now, then I got into a puzzle, which I'm surprised it took me so long to figure out.

102
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:18,800
But I used to think until last time after class that there was some kind of conflict between whether you make your life a work of art, which is a fixed style, which covers every aspect of your life and presumably remains the same through all your life, and you spend your time perspecting it.

103
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,720
How does that relate to the brief habits, which you're constantly changing?

104
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:25,200
Well, I thought that was a problem.

105
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:33,520
But then one of the people in the class explained to me, and once you see it, it seems perfectly obvious, and I don't know why I didn't see it.

106
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:39,840
You can have a whole series of brief habits, all in the style of whatever your style is.

107
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,560
There doesn't have to be any conflict.

108
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:55,919
The brief habits are the content, so to speak, and they change completely, whether it's cities or people or ideas or whatever.

109
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:03,360
But your way of taking them up and doing them for a while when they're a brief habit is always your way.

110
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:06,719
And I can't describe it anymore than to say it's your way.

111
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:11,200
I mean, Bogey does it his way, presumably, if he has brief habits.

112
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:13,760
And that's good.

113
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:21,280
Brief habits for Bogart would be like being in all sorts of different movies.

114
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,040
But he can be in different movies.

115
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,559
He could be a detective.

116
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:25,679
He could be a criminal.

117
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,359
He could be a lover.

118
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:30,000
He could be a soldier.

119
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,600
But it's always in his same style.

120
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,480
Okay, so that that's that's the story for...

121
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,360
Now that's the fourth one, the fourth way of having a healthy life.

122
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:42,400
Yeah, Beatrice.

123
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,839
And what about?

124
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:47,959
Oh, it is, it is, but it is and it isn't.

125
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:49,320
I mean, that's a good question.

126
00:10:49,319 --> 00:10:52,600
Why isn't an unconditional commitment to your style?

127
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:57,960
Well, that's I sort of answered that without meaning to when I said that it has no content.

128
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:02,360
It isn't like justice for the black people or loving Beatrice.

129
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,560
It's just a style.

130
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,839
It can any content.

131
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:08,119
You can love Beatrice or you can love a guy instead if you're a guy.

132
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:12,919
Or you can just love your work and know other people.

133
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:22,280
You can do anything and have an unconditional commitment to it in the style because the style has not got any content.

134
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:28,360
You can't have an unconditional commitment to being being in having bogey style.

135
00:11:28,439 --> 00:12:20,800
Bogey's got to have a commitment to something if he's going to be an I don't know if he's if he is a you know a Kierkegaardian individual but if he were a Kierkegaardian individual then we'd have to find out well who does he love or what cause is he devoted to or is he maybe acting could be his commitment but acting isn't his style okay yeah ah ah well that's an interesting question too where does style come from after the cataclysm well the answer is something like that what's nice about style is it's not affected by the cataclysm that's a terrific question because I would never have thought of saying this but that's what's interesting about it I mean it's not in the meaning business you did there is no why you have it and no way to to justify it.

136
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:31,040
And if all the the, see, there's I mean I should jump to the to the nihilism thing for a minute, because after the cataclysm, I'll get to the more details.

137
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,160
The why has no, me finds no answer.

138
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,839
He says, what does nihilism mean?

139
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:42,000
The highest values devaluate themselves, the aim is lacking, why finds no answer.

140
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:50,640
There is no question about the why of a style, neither where it came from, nor why this style is better than that style.

141
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,919
It's not in the ethical business.

142
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:59,439
So after the cataclysm, the free spirits will still be around.

143
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:04,640
They're having a good time, being cheerful, and cultivating their styles.

144
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,359
Does that help?

145
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,079
You look worried.

146
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,440
I thought that was a terrific answer.

147
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:15,200
Well, that's interesting, too.

148
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,360
That's a tough one.

149
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,600
I'll tell you how it comes up.

150
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:23,760
I mean, how much does your style depend upon other people?

151
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:32,160
Well, in a certain sense, not, because you can have any style that you can imagine no matter what everybody else thinks.

152
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:49,679
However, and your point is right, so you can't really imagine having the style of a, I don't know, a Native American buffalo hunter or something, whatever style they had, if the whole society is gone now and doesn't support that kind of style.

153
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:55,040
So your style is limited by what your current culture can support.

154
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,319
And yet, it's not limited in the way sort of meanings are.

155
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:05,919
It's not that some styles which you can understand thanks to your culture are bad.

156
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,400
Any style you can understand, you can have it.

157
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,760
I mean, understand is the wrong word.

158
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,399
No, never mind.

159
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,119
Admire.

160
00:14:11,119 --> 00:14:21,319
Any style that you can admire, and that means any style offered up by your culture as a possibility which you can admire, you can have.

161
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:24,199
Now, I'll tell you why that's interesting and relevant.

162
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,040
How many have heard of Michel Foucault?

163
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:31,079
I don't know whether his name has, oh boy, he's gotten to, gotten to lots of people.

164
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:38,920
When he was here last, he filled Zellerbach, 2,000 people and had people beating on the door when he was lecturing.

165
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,719
Sure, he's a.

166
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,359
One of the last things he said was that you should make your life a work of art.

167
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:50,040
He was always a Nietzschean, but he just hadn't used that aspect of Nietzsche.

168
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:57,799
He was doing what Nietzsche called genealogy, we're not going to, which is tracing where our beliefs come from, which is not what we're talking about.

169
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:12,919
But when he said make your life a work of art, then a kind of discussion among us Foucault people, of which I was one at that point, wondered, well, to what extent does that mean that it's something you can just do on your own no matter what?

170
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:18,760
And to what extent does that mean that you're dependent on what is possible in your culture?

171
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,839
And I think the answer is you get an answer from aesthetics.

172
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,520
To what extent can a painter paint in any style?

173
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:32,280
Well, certainly any style that's already admirable, they can.

174
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,760
It'd be sort of boring if somebody started painting in Rembrandt style, if they could.

175
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:41,719
But the main thing is the artists are inventing new styles.

176
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:49,719
And that's so you can't say that they sort of have a spectrum of styles available from the culture, and they will pick one.

177
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,000
But you can't say that they can just invent any old style.

178
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:01,520
You can't invent the style of, say, Mozart if you haven't gone through Bach, and you can't get to Beethoven if you don't go through Mozart and Haydn and so forth.

179
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:18,879
There's certain ways that music or painting or any architecture, any art form develops that it only allows certain new things, although you can't have a list of the new things that allows until some artist comes along and creates some new thing.

180
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:21,600
So, okay, so it's who asked this question?

181
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:22,400
You, yeah.

182
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,520
So it's interesting.

183
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:31,040
It's both very independent of the culture, more than any sort of ethical principles are.

184
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,280
And it's not totally independent of the culture.

185
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,960
You're on something, you're on the right track.

186
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,839
Yeah, Beatrice.

187
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,000
Rendering the old form in content?

188
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,760
Yes, I think so.

189
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,359
I think that's absolutely right.

190
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:50,479
And I think that he wants that because he wants to get at something that is not universal and doesn't have to be understood.

191
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,639
It just has to be appreciated.

192
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,720
And style is appreciated, but it doesn't have a content.

193
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,359
Yeah, I think it's supposed to be split.

194
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,520
Because I think you could, I don't know.

195
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,040
I mean, you can't, it's a puzzle, really, if you start thinking about it.

196
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,520
Can you just do any old thing in any old style?

197
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,879
I wouldn't think so.

198
00:17:12,879 --> 00:17:16,000
So they have some kind of tenuous relation.

199
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You can't, what, let's think about it.

200
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,280
Let's we've got bogey style as our example.

201
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,440
Can you can bogey play a priest in a movie?

202
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:31,040
That does seem like your gears get split if you try to picture that.

203
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,879
That just doesn't seem to work.

204
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:41,280
So there is some kind of relation to what sort of thing you can, what sort of content you can do with that style.

205
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,240
I don't think you can play a serial killer either.

206
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,040
I mean, there are certain things, certain contents that just don't go with certain styles.

207
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:51,080
That's all interesting.

208
00:17:51,879 --> 00:17:53,400
I don't know what else to say about it.

209
00:17:53,399 --> 00:17:54,760
It's a typical Nietzsche thing.

210
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,480
It raises a whole lot of questions that you could think about.

211
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:57,719
Yeah.

212
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,480
The Nietzsche wouldn't want that.

213
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,879
I think he wants to exclude certain content.

214
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:08,280
Well, yeah, he will include, well, style ought to include, exclude certain things.

215
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:08,680
Yeah.

216
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:31,639
Well, yes, if you it excludes living so as to be like everybody else, trying to be respectable, trying to be attractive, having the official smile of the people in the United States now, and which you which everybody puts on when anybody takes a picture of them.

217
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:37,000
That is certainly not the kind of style he would admire.

218
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,599
So I guess maybe you have to add at least this.

219
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,319
It has to be your unique style.

220
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:46,040
You can't just be imitating.

221
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:56,839
You can do an interesting individual variation, which is your own unique style and some style, and artists do that.

222
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:58,679
By the way, one more thing.

223
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,839
Does Bogey make a gesture like this in his movies?

224
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:04,440
I've been told he does.

225
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,439
I don't remember ever seeing that.

226
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,480
You've got to realize when you see this movie that this is a bogey gesture.

227
00:19:11,639 --> 00:19:15,799
And when you see it, try to figure out if you've seen him do that in any movie.

228
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:16,920
I don't remember.

229
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,160
Where were we?

230
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,520
Yeah, oh, you're full of good questions.

231
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,000
Yeah.

232
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,360
Sometimes they're like, I have to.

233
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,680
Well, maybe.

234
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,160
I don't know.

235
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,680
I think having one unified style sort of precludes having others.

236
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:44,799
If you read the thing and you put pieces of yourself, get rid of some and cover up others and bring out others and work at transcribing.

237
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,720
I suppose you've got a weird way of smiling.

238
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,399
You can work at getting rid of it.

239
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:58,639
But once you've done all that work, do you likely get another style in which you change completely all the things that you're trying to change?

240
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,439
You make a whole different job of constructing yourself.

241
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,879
You're throwing out the old one.

242
00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:11,119
It looks like you got one for life, not because styles have to be for life, like unconditional commitments.

243
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:18,479
It's just that if you put a lot of work into one, it's unlikely you're going to throw it away and put a lot of work into another, though you could.

244
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,439
Again, all these are good questions.

245
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,119
It would have been a good paper topic, but not an exam paper topic.

246
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,479
So we'll have to save it for some other course.

247
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,919
Anything else?

248
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,200
Yeah, Beatrice, this is really full of questions today.

249
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,760
What?

250
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:36,079
No, he wants it to be unified.

251
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:42,319
Well, it is mono something, but it's not the wrong, I mean, it's a mono that's all right.

252
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:46,640
Just like an unconditional commitment, sort of.

253
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:47,520
Well, not quite.

254
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:49,040
Well, it's not a brief habit either.

255
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,719
See, he's really found something interesting.

256
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:58,240
It's not a brief habit because as we just said, it's takes too much work in it to be throwing it out every once in a while and getting bored with it.

257
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,240
You should be constantly improving it.

258
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,000
So it's not a brief habit.

259
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,920
It's not an unconditional commitment.

260
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,799
It's not that you eternally have to play this style.

261
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:13,359
If you really want to scrap it all and start again and have your face made over and your voice change your voice, you can do it.

262
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,080
People do it.

263
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,760
People change their sex and become totally different with different styles.

264
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:19,879
That's a lot of work.

265
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:24,599
So, but that it should be unified.

266
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:27,479
You know, that sounds like an old virtue.

267
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:47,559
And I think, I don't know what to say, except that Nietzsche admits the positive value of unity provided it's imposed in a controlled way by the will on everything about you.

268
00:21:47,559 --> 00:22:02,040
That's what happened with the controlling all his impulses controlled in one unified self that's always just about to come apart, but always some part of it else or other gets control and keeps it from falling apart.

269
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:15,559
So his picture is a unified style in which all the tendencies that you notice, as you fix one of them and you find some other tendency in you you want to fix, then get into that style.

270
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:19,639
This movement toward a unity is not a kind of resting place.

271
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,399
It's not peace.

272
00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:22,839
It's not harmony.

273
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:27,079
It's not having finally arrived at a stable view.

274
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:39,160
But it should sort of gain control or struggle to gain control of every aspect of how you talk and how you walk and how you write and how you know how you sleep.

275
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:40,839
I don't know if that can come under style.

276
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:41,799
Now I doubt it.

277
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:44,679
But anyway, okay, you're looking unhappy, Carl.

278
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,280
About what I'm saying?

279
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:47,959
Okay.

280
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,040
Anything else?

281
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:53,160
Okay, well then we're going to change the subject altogether.

282
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,959
I had no idea it was such an interesting subject.

283
00:22:56,599 --> 00:24:35,400
We're going to go to the will to power piece, which is in front of you because it's about nihilism yeah what extra are they still going around as have we used them all up anybody got an extra one hmm we used them all up are there are there people who don't have it that want it oh dear I didn't make enough I then can you sort of share it with somebody who's near you if you've got one and because it is important to have it in front of you okay now yeah yes yes it's not just for today that's why you won't you can you can give it away because it's it's posted online it's if you go where did I put this URL just now oh yeah it's on the it's on the it's on the paper at the end of the paper topics is the URL where this is posted and I know it's there because I just put it there so so don't worry about giving it away to somebody who needs one and sharing it with somebody because they are you can print one you get when you get home now the from now on we're talking about nihilism because nihilism is certainly what's going on in breathless and we've got to understand what nihilism is by the way since it's sort of on my mind I'll just tell you something that's going to happen quite a little while from now have you got do you realize this business of on the same page that everybody's going to see ang Li's the ice storm.

284
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:37,639
Has that been announced yet?

285
00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:41,479
You know, there's always something that everybody is supposed to, every freshman, anyways.

286
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,079
But how many freshmen here?

287
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:50,040
Well, you will soon hear and soon get informed about this.

288
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,559
Ang Li is going to actually talk.

289
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:53,000
How many seen the ice storm?

290
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,240
It's probably a little before your time.

291
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,839
It's a terrific movie.

292
00:24:56,839 --> 00:25:01,639
It's going to be shown all around, and Ang Lui is going to be here to discuss it.

293
00:25:01,639 --> 00:25:07,240
And I just tell you, because you won't be in front of me for the time it happens, it's a nihilism movie.

294
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,240
It fits right in with this.

295
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,599
And the whole subject of the movie is that.

296
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:18,839
Nobody knows what to do or why.

297
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:20,119
Okay.

298
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,199
And keep your eyes open for it.

299
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:23,079
Do take it in.

300
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:24,520
It's a really good movie.

301
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,640
Now, here we go.

302
00:25:25,639 --> 00:25:32,760
We start with nihilism by explaining, of course, but I haven't said it in so many words.

303
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,479
Nihilism is a problem for our culture.

304
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,119
The people in Bali don't have to worry about it.

305
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:43,079
And nor the Homeric Greeks, nor even the Athenian Greeks.

306
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:48,280
But why is it a problem for our culture and only for our culture?

307
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,319
I mean, it could be another one, but it seems to be only ours.

308
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:58,119
And that's because, remember, because our culture has become meaning addicts, as I called it.

309
00:25:58,119 --> 00:26:00,359
This is so important for Nietzsche.

310
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:10,839
And again, when I read it before, I couldn't tell whether he thinks our culture or all cultures, but I think he thinks our culture, though he doesn't say it.

311
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:13,000
But here we are at the bottom of 75.

312
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:23,240
Gradually, man, I want to say Western man, and I bet he does too, has become a fantastic animal that has to fulfill one more condition of existence than any other animal.

313
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:29,599
Western man has to believe, to know from time to time, why he exists.

314
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:31,599
His race cannot flourish.

315
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:32,959
Well, maybe he means all human beings.

316
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:43,119
I can't believe it, though, because why would it happen sort of simultaneously in the Bushman in New Guinea and to the polytheists in Japan?

317
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:44,479
I'm going to do it my way.

318
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:59,200
Anyway, he has to understand why his race, that is, us in the West, cannot flourish without a periodic thrust in life, or trust in life, without faith in reason to live.

319
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:01,840
Boy, I really find this amazing.

320
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:10,559
Again and again, the human race will decree from time to time there is a thing in which it is absolutely henceforth forbidden to laugh.

321
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:15,599
And that's the reason they've all become meaning.

322
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:33,119
Well, that's a funny, that's a thing I'm very surprised at because Nietzsche has such a sense of history and how the human animal has no nature and gets all sorts of natures depending on where you happen to grow up and in what culture.

323
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:49,839
Why should he believe that the human race, all of them, people, somehow innate in them, is that they have a need for meaning when he knows that they don't really have a need for meaning because they can become free spirits.

324
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,559
Or another way to put it, he doesn't believe it's sort of genetic determination that they have a need for meaning.

325
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,679
How come they all have a need for meaning?

326
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:01,839
Let me think about it here.

327
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:09,120
And remember the business about people, human beings don't have any fixed horizons like animals.

328
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,319
It makes us like an animal.

329
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:17,159
And it says, here's this race of animals, you can call human beings, which have to have meaning in order to exist.

330
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:23,720
And then you wouldn't understand how they gradually became that kind of animal.

331
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,000
That would seem to happen differently at different times in different cultures.

332
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,959
I give up.

333
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,240
I've never noticed it.

334
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,479
Now that I've noticed it, I don't know how to deal with it.

335
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,959
You look like you might have a view about how to deal with it.

336
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:35,240
Do you?

337
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,679
Well, you need what test it?

338
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:39,000
Ah, oh, you take one.

339
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,599
Yeah, we need, you need it.

340
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,280
Oh, but that's not the text.

341
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,679
I see, no, no, that's not the text I was reading, though.

342
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,079
I'm reading the gay science right now.

343
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:49,639
I'm reading Gay Science 75.

344
00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:52,119
I'm setting up the text of the will to power.

345
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:56,680
Anyway, the will, I mean, all I can say is we're running into lots of interesting problems.

346
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,520
Nietzsche is full of interesting problems.

347
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,559
I don't know what he's doing there, but I know that I could fix it.

348
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:05,959
All I have to do is say the Western X, and you've got it.

349
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:14,040
I don't even think for him the Homeric Greeks have yet become believers that they have to have meaning.

350
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,719
They've got to have wonder.

351
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,479
They've got to have the sacred.

352
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,359
They've got to have something at which you can't laugh.

353
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:26,359
But to call it meaning is to make it in a, is to distinguish it from wonder.

354
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:28,839
That seems to me just the wrong way to go.

355
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:29,240
Yeah.

356
00:29:29,879 --> 00:29:35,880
I wonder if you're trying to distinguish between meaning and purpose.

357
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,240
Purpose.

358
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,839
Well, I'm not distinguishing between meaning and purpose.

359
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:42,439
I see, let's think about that.

360
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,319
Man, all human beings have to have a sense of purpose.

361
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,520
They have to have.

362
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,159
You think that's what he's talking about?

363
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:54,599
He wants to know why he exists.

364
00:29:54,599 --> 00:30:01,359
His race cannot flourish without a periodic trust in life, without faith, in reason in life.

365
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:04,240
He wants to know why he exists.

366
00:29:59,879 --> 00:30:05,119
Let me think about it.

367
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:09,599
Well, for one thing, we know that the free spirit doesn't need that.

368
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:12,799
So it can't be something that human beings just have.

369
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:20,399
So how come all over, all human beings develop a sense that they have to know why they exist?

370
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,960
I don't know if the Bali people know why they exist.

371
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,080
They've got other things to worry about, that the gods are coming all the time.

372
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:28,079
Every day is a religious holiday.

373
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:32,079
It's all wonderful, and you have to keep all the ritual and all the flowers.

374
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,120
They don't have time to worry about why they exist.

375
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:37,919
It just isn't a sensible question, I think.

376
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,199
So I'm still puzzled.

377
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:39,439
Yeah.

378
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:53,120
All these things have all tendencies that impose their Nietzsche thinking everybody imposes their interpretation.

379
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:56,480
It seems to me somehow that should include wonder.

380
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,520
I mean, these terms all need to be defined more clearly than I'm defining them.

381
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:07,120
Everybody interpretational.

382
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:10,800
See, they can think of it as full of gods, for instance.

383
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:20,160
And they can think of themselves as, well, maybe their purpose is then worshiping those gods.

384
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,920
Then that could be the meaning in their life.

385
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,240
I'm just thinking out loud.

386
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:32,319
So they all have the meaning that they should be interpreted for sort of satisfying their gods.

387
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,720
Of course, do they all have gods?

388
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,760
Do those gods all demand satisfaction?

389
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:38,800
I don't know.

390
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,119
Again, I'm going to do my simplified version of it, but I'm glad you're all raising.

391
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:49,160
This is what it is to do philosophy and read hard books like Nietzsche, raising the right kind of interesting questions.

392
00:31:50,520 --> 00:32:07,880
A sub-truth, which I'm going to stick to, is that in the West, we have a strong demand to understand sort of what the universe is for, what we're here for, and we somehow got it at some point in our history.

393
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:14,120
And I don't know if Nietzsche thinks the Homeric Greeks already had it.

394
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:15,240
I doubt it.

395
00:32:15,239 --> 00:32:25,240
I can't believe that he thinks that they have become the kind of fantastic animal that he doesn't like, because he thinks they're terrific.

396
00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:26,839
So I'm confused.

397
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,760
But I'm going to stick to my story.

398
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:45,639
We in the West, thanks to the Athenian Greeks, thanks to the Hebrews, who told us exactly what it all meant and where we fitted it and what we were supposed to do, have become meaning addicts, and that's enough to get us into nihilism.

399
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:47,800
And that's another way to put the problem.

400
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,800
If everybody's a meaning addict, why isn't everybody a nihilist?

401
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:59,800
And he's clear that nihilism is a modern, recent thing, and only in the West.

402
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,960
So I'm lost.

403
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,440
But as I say, I'm not really lost because I've got my minimal interpretation.

404
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,160
Just add in the West that it all makes sense.

405
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:32,320
At some point in the history of the West, after the Homeric Greeks, and by the time of Plato, everybody had been given an answer to why we're here and what we're supposed to do, and an answer that is based on God and some sort of reason and is true for everybody and gives your life meaning and purpose.

406
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:37,520
And that's all he needs to make the point about nihilism.

407
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,160
Okay?

408
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,599
It's this passage which I don't like.

409
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:44,319
I mean, I don't know where else he says anything like this.

410
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,839
Hey, well, you guys keep your interested in more Nietzsche.

411
00:33:47,840 --> 00:34:06,640
If you come across passages in which he tells us more about whether he thinks all human beings are fantastic animals who can't get along without meaning, or whether he tells us more about why he thinks it comes around in our culture now and only in our culture.

412
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,120
See, in our culture, God is dead.

413
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,440
And that seems to be a very, very peculiar feature of our culture.

414
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:22,000
Where we once, see, and in our culture, I'm getting more and more convinced that I can't agree with Nietzsche on page 75.

415
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,480
We know that in our culture, everything has been built into this God, and everything has been explained in terms of it.

416
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,079
That's why it's a cataclysm.

417
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,599
If that God comes down, everything comes down.

418
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,319
So, and we're the only culture who's got that.

419
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:44,160
We're the only culture who, he says, that it's the greatest kind of catastrophe and the greatest overcoming that ever happened in history.

420
00:34:44,159 --> 00:35:04,559
That means we're the only culture who are so committed to meaning that we find meaning, we demand meaning and purpose in everything and build it all into this religious structure, such that if that religious structure becomes unbelievable, everything collapses and we get nihilism.

421
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:12,000
But it's clear that that only happens, it's never happened, he says, never happened in any other culture.

422
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,480
So, okay, so I'm sticking to my line.

423
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,159
Anyone want to quarrel with it?

424
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:17,959
Let's not.

425
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,559
Okay, quarrel with it.

426
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:20,359
Jason, what?

427
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,000
Nihilism is not the highest value.

428
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,439
The highest values devaluate themselves.

429
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,599
I mean, wouldn't that apply to everyone?

430
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:37,320
Yes, that's true, but it's but there's more to nihilism than that.

431
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,599
If that was all, it was nihilism, but then I just answered what you just said before you said it.

432
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:49,559
But not only do the highest values devaluate themselves, but in nihilism, everything is built into those highest values.

433
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:52,919
So when they devaluate themselves, everything devaluates themselves.

434
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,599
Then you've got real nihilism.

435
00:35:54,599 --> 00:36:04,440
I mean, maybe there's kind of partial nihilism where some god or other gets killed off or discredited, but not everything.

436
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,640
Now I'm going to read this because this is very important to us.

437
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:11,320
And we've got to get it read before you see the movie.

438
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,559
So I'm going to go to where I am keeping track of what I'm talking about.

439
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:20,280
So we get a definition of nihilism on the second page.

440
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:23,559
I'm going to start with that and then sort of back up and fill it in.

441
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:24,839
I read it already.

442
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,840
It's so straight on.

443
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:34,280
The number two, right, at the top, spring 87.

444
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:36,279
So what does nihilism mean?

445
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:39,079
That the highest values devaluate themselves.

446
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:40,759
The aim is lacking.

447
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,800
Why finds no response?

448
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:55,079
So you'd expect in a nihilistic culture, there'd be no answer to why people love people, betray people, help people, and so forth and so forth.

449
00:36:55,079 --> 00:37:02,800
Okay, and then from there, we're going to go to the front page.

450
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:13,599
And I've got to read a whole lot because he lays out more clearly than any place else exactly all that's involved in nihilism.

451
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,079
And there's sort of four components.

452
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,960
So, first, the nihilism is a psychological state which has to be reached first.

453
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,960
Now, where that's number one component.

454
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,399
When we sought a meaning in all events, you see, sought a meaning in all events.

455
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,240
That's why everything collapses.

456
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:32,320
That is a meaning that is not there.

457
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,639
So, the seeker eventually becomes discouraged.

458
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:44,640
Nihilism is the recognition of the long waste of strength, the in vain, the insecurity to recover and regain composure, composed here.

459
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:49,359
Being ashamed in front of oneself as one was deceived oneself for too long.

460
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,880
See, this is all very Western.

461
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,079
This does not happen in Japan or Bali.

462
00:37:54,239 --> 00:38:01,359
This meaning could have been the fulfillment of some highest ethical canon in all events, the moral world, order.

463
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,599
Now he's listing the meaning, which is helpful.

464
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,119
Those of you who had some other philosophy courses will recognize some of them.

465
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:18,480
There could be fulfillment, that's Greek, that's Aristotle, that is the meaning to get as much fulfillment out of life as possible.

466
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:34,240
It could be the moral order, that's Kant, that you obey the moral law, or the growth of love and harmony in the intercourse of beings, that could be Dostoevsky, or the gradual approximation of a state of universal happiness.

467
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:36,639
That's uh utilitarian.

468
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:47,400
That's the wo the one where he says only the English love happiness 'cause they invented the utilitarianism that something is good if it if it gives you the greatest happiness to the greatest number of people.

469
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:52,840
Or it could be the development towards a state of universal annihilation.

470
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,359
That is really amazing.

471
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,440
I took me a while, I was sort of stunned to think what would that be?

472
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:11,480
Well, it would be one like one of these suicide cults, like the people in Jonestown, which is a little before your time now, but you've probably heard of it, where they somehow got themselves into the idea that they should all commit suicide and put poison in their Kool-Aid.

473
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,480
And I don't know how many hundred people, does anybody know, who died in John?

474
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:24,360
Seven hundred, that's and that seems to be their the meaning in their world was to get out of this world as quickly as possible when they had a suicide cult.

475
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:28,119
Any and any goal at least constitutes some meaning.

476
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:32,360
What all these notions have in common is that something is to be achieved through the process.

477
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:36,759
And now one realizes that becoming aims at nothing and achieves nothing.

478
00:39:36,759 --> 00:39:38,919
Okay, that's the first stage.

479
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,559
Yeah.

480
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,599
Universal annihilation.

481
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:44,040
A philosopher.

482
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,079
I doubt it.

483
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:45,880
I don't know.

484
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:51,239
I mean in a way Schopenhauer w would wanted everybody to be able to commit suicide.

485
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:56,680
I don't really he didn't exactly propose they do it, but I don't know why they didn't why they don't do it.

486
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:01,800
I guess it's because the will to life is strong, so strong in them that they can't do it.

487
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,840
But if they could, they it probably Schopenhauer.

488
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,679
And that would be good for Nietzsche because he would have Schopenhauer sort of looking over his shoulder.

489
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:27,800
That was his guru until he it turned Nietzsche is so much into the will to life and the importance of life and the way life is constantly outgrowing and expanding and joyful because Schopenhauer was so much his teacher, in effect, was so much against life when he said it was all misery and suffering, and the quicker you could get out of it, the better.

490
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,159
And he lo he liked the Buddhist Schopenhauer.

491
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:36,000
Nietzsche turned against the Buddhists when he went to this life-involvement business.

492
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:36,879
Okay, number two.

493
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:58,720
Nihilism as a psychological state is reached secondly when one has posited a totality, a systematization, indeed, any organization in which all events and underneath all events, organization in all events and underneath all events, and a soul that longs to admire and revere has wallowed in the idea of some supreme form of domination and administration.

494
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:00,319
That's the supreme being.

495
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:10,240
I mean, that's when you get a religion in which there is one supreme being administering and creating and overseeing everything.

496
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:15,359
And again, that seems so ununiversal.

497
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,319
I mean, that's very Western, one supreme being.

498
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,439
That's only the Judeo-Christian-Muslim bunch there.

499
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,040
Where else do you get supreme beings?

500
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:29,840
Not in Buddhism, not in polytheism, nowhere else.

501
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,679
So it looks like it's us.

502
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:32,879
So let's go into three.

503
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,319
Nihilism, psychological state, the third and last form.

504
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:55,280
Given these two insights, that becoming has no goal and that underneath all, all becoming, there is no grand unity in which an individual could immerse himself completely as in an element of supreme value, an escape remains to pass sentence on this whole world of becoming as a deception and invent a world beyond it, a true world.

505
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:07,760
As soon as man finds out how that world is fabricated, the true world, from his own psychological needs and how he has absolutely no right to it, the last form of nihilism comes into being.

506
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:13,920
It includes disbelief in any metaphysical world and forbids itself any belief in the true world.

507
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:23,559
The true world would be Plato, the good, or whatever philosopher you happen to like who has his view of what the world is.

508
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:31,079
That's the most highly worked out form of avoiding nihilism.

509
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:32,679
But then what happens at the bottom?

510
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:34,759
What has happened at bottom?

511
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:36,360
Question mark.

512
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:48,520
The feeling of valuelessness was reached with the realization that the overall character of existence may not be interpreted by means of the concept of aim, the concept of unity, or the concept of truth.

513
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,520
Existence has no goal or end.

514
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,040
Any comprehensive unity in the plurality of events is lacking.

515
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,160
The character of existence is not true.

516
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,840
It's false.

517
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:03,400
One simply lacks any reason for convincing oneself that there is a true world.

518
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:13,000
Briefly, the categories of aim and unity and being, which we use to project some value into the world, we pull out again, and the world looks valueless.

519
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,280
That's so clear.

520
00:43:14,279 --> 00:43:44,280
He thinks that we have projected all this meaning because we, Western fanatical, fantastical animals, have gotten to expect so much meaning and projected so much meaning that if we then realize, because we're always trying to be honest with ourselves, we realize that we just projected all that because we really needed all that, we take it out, and then everything collapses.

521
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,480
So now I'm keeping track of where I am.

522
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:47,960
Let's see.

523
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:52,759
So then you get the extremist kind of nihilism, radical nihilism.

524
00:43:52,759 --> 00:43:57,160
That's right after what does nihilism mean unto?

525
00:43:57,159 --> 00:44:14,639
Radical nihilism is the conviction of an absolute untenability of existence when it comes to the highest values one recognizes, plus the realization that we lack the least right to posit beyond or an in itself of things that might be divine or morality incarnate.

526
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:17,680
I mean, that is, any kind of supreme being.

527
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:21,199
This realization is a consequence of the cultivation of truthfulness.

528
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:27,760
You see, that's what I said when I said you try to be honest about your desires and honest about the world.

529
00:44:27,759 --> 00:44:43,760
The church, I just remind you, the church with its sort of highly sophisticated notion of confession has gotten very critical and skeptical about desires and knows that you can't mistake your desires for what's really there.

530
00:44:43,759 --> 00:44:49,599
Physics, I didn't do the story about physics, but physics gets very good at telling us what's really there.

531
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:58,320
And physics tells us, according to Nietzsche, what's really there is just a chaos with no direction that has anything to do with us.

532
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:12,159
And the combination, because we really want the truth, leads us to see that we can't believe in any religion anymore, any meaning anymore, any goal, any purpose, any aim.

533
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:14,800
That's radical nihilism.

534
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,079
And then what?

535
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:22,320
Well, that flips over into cheerfulness.

536
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:27,839
Just as remember, right after the death of God, the name of the next section is the meaning of our cheerfulness.

537
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:32,000
Well, the cheerfulness is here in number 14, a little below the middle.

538
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,839
Values and their changes are related, and why are we cheerful?

539
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:39,760
Well, because we can increase our power.

540
00:45:39,759 --> 00:45:44,639
Values and their changes are related to increases in power of those positing the values.

541
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,559
Positing means we make up the value.

542
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:55,000
We can decide that what's valuable is, let's say, saving the earth and the environment.

543
00:45:55,079 --> 00:46:06,599
Now, there's nothing in the universe that says they need to save the earth, or the universe doesn't care a bit about the earth, and there's nobody around to care about the earth, and the earth doesn't seem to be going in the direction of saving itself and so forth.

544
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:14,440
But we can make it a value, and we can dedicate ourselves to reversing global warming and so forth.

545
00:46:14,759 --> 00:46:17,159
And when we do, that's good.

546
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:18,839
That increases our power.

547
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:34,040
I mean, we have the power to set goals and purposes and to pursue them, as long as we understand that they're ours and not that they're not by to ourselves, that the goals and purposes are somehow built into us or into reality.

548
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:37,799
So that's the positive cheerful nihilism.

549
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,480
So he's gone now.

550
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:45,400
The measure of unbelief, of permitted freedom of the spirit, as an expression of the increase in power.

551
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:50,440
So the greatest overcoming is when the whole world collapses.

552
00:46:50,440 --> 00:47:03,079
And the greatest convalescence is when the free spirit comes along and deals with this whole collapse by just freely choosing what to care as purpose and then doing it.

553
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:06,760
Now, of course, that might be an impossible idea.

554
00:47:06,759 --> 00:47:08,999
I think it is an impossible idea.

555
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:17,720
I don't see how anything that you just sort of arbitrarily choose is going to have any authority and power to motivate you.

556
00:47:17,719 --> 00:47:23,000
And I think Nietzsche would just say that that shows about me that I'm sick and not a free spirit.

557
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:32,079
If I were a free spirit, I'd understand that I can posit anything I please, that it'll make me stronger, and what more would anybody want than to sort of make up values and then pursue them?

558
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,399
So I'm back now and we're still reading under number 14.

559
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:45,840
Nihilism, an ideal of the highest degree of powerfulness of the spirit, the over-richest life, partly destructive, partly ironic.

560
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,160
So that's the free spirit again.

561
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:50,400
The free spirit has this power.

562
00:47:50,400 --> 00:48:07,520
The free spirit is sort of over-rich, that is, so overflowing in liveliness and in brief habits, in making life a work of art, in living dangerously, all of that.

563
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,280
That's this over-rich life, and it's partly destructive.

564
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:12,960
Why is it destructive?

565
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:20,880
Well, it's destroying all the complacency of the people in the marketplace who haven't heard that God is dead.

566
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,839
Then that's all got to be destroyed.

567
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:26,720
And that's okay with Nietzsche.

568
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:29,520
And it's partly ironic.

569
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,559
That's because it can laugh at anything sacred.

570
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:46,640
Remember that every culture has declared that there's something, some God, some moral principle, some ethical norm, some purpose which is sacred and which you can't laugh at.

571
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:54,320
And the free spirit can make fun of and laugh at anything, and that's the ironic side of it.

572
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:05,200
Okay, and now we're just about ready to, as far as the movie is concerned, just put in the last, the bottom of page two.

573
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,520
I'm not going to tell you why it's important.

574
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,800
I'm just going to give you a clue that it's very important.

575
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,680
So nihilism is ambiguous.

576
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,880
First, I'm going to start with B.

577
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:20,520
Nihilism has decline, recession of the power of the spirit.

578
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,119
That's what he calls.

579
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:29,480
Then, but there's also, A, nihilism is a sign of increased power of the spirit, active nihilism.

580
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,240
That's free spirits.

581
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,839
So nihilism is totally ambiguous, as he says.

582
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:37,239
It isn't necessarily a bad thing.

583
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:39,320
In fact, it's a very, very good thing.

584
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:53,639
It's what the free spirits appreciate, what makes them cheerful, what gives them plenty to do, positing values all over the place, and going out on always inventing new worlds, new eyes, new suns, new whatever.

585
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:59,880
We try to, as you read it, keep a list of how many new things Nietzsche thinks people can invent.

586
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:02,520
That's nihilism, too.

587
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,119
But that's active nihilism.

588
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:17,479
That says we don't have, there's no why, no purpose outside of us, but we will give ourselves whys and purposes to act on.

589
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:23,559
And then we'll do them for a while, like brief habits, and then we can drop them and give ourselves some other purpose and act on them.

590
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,239
What more could you want?

591
00:50:25,239 --> 00:50:27,000
That makes you very powerful.

592
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
That makes you feel very alive.

593
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,120
That if you're doing it well, it'll fill you with excitement and wonder.

594
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:39,559
And that's the new health that comes after the collapse.

595
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:47,880
Okay, that's all you need to know to appreciate Breathless and understand it, as nobody, as far as I know, has understood it.

596
00:50:48,279 --> 00:50:49,319
I don't know why.

597
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:54,759
It seems to me as clear as could possibly be what's going on in there.

598
00:50:54,759 --> 00:51:04,480
But you'll have to think about it for yourself, and we'll see it Thursday and talk about it on the following Tuesday.

599
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:15,040
And you should be sure and be here at 3:35 to see the beginning.

600
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,079
Though if you don't, if you aren't, don't feel bad.

601
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:19,920
Nothing important happens.

602
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,920
It's all beautifully done and extremely fun.

603
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,079
But nothing important happens in the first 10 or 15 minutes.

604
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,719
And then from then on, everything is dictated.

605
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:32,160
You're looking puzzled.

606
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:33,840
You don't think that's true?

607
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,800
You don't think something important happens?

608
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:37,599
Only.

609
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:39,439
I see.

610
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,159
Oh, a lot of important things about how movies are made happen.

611
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:44,480
It's a totally new world movies.

612
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:44,959
No?

613
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,079
I don't think so.

614
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:48,400
We're going to have lots of debates about the next lecture.

615
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,599
I can hear that.

616
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:52,000
But, oh, how many know Breathless?

617
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,440
I've seen it very recently.

618
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:58,240
How far into the movie, how many minutes into the movie, does he visit his old girlfriend?

619
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:00,320
Try to get money for her.

620
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,760
Ten minutes, maybe?

621
00:52:01,759 --> 00:52:03,120
Something like that.

622
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:08,639
Anyway, when you get there, don't feel bad.

623
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:09,599
You haven't missed anything.

624
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,119
You need to understand the plot.

625
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:12,079
And there is a plot.

626
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:23,359
I mean, whether Beatrice is right that it's somehow not important and taken back, or whether I'm right and think that this plot is exactly the right plot, and there is a lot to argue about.

627
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:26,399
Okay, now I'm not going to send you all home.

628
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:33,359
That would be a bad idea, given that we've got only, where's my notebook?

629
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:38,079
I mean, I don't want to be wrong about this, or I will send you all, but I'm pretty sure.

630
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:40,400
Okay, we're going to show Breathless Thursday.

631
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:47,480
We're going to have a discussion of Breathless on Tuesday, and we're going to wrap up our comparison to these three people.

632
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:53,000
I'm going to tell you what existentialism is because everybody tells me I should tell them what existentialism is.

633
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:59,799
I don't think that's very important, but if you want to know, you come and I'll try to tell you.

634
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:24,599
But in the meantime, I'm going to switch now to one of the ways that Nietzsche and Dostoevsky and Kierkegaard all have a certain view in common, a very important view, namely that they all make a mistake that Nietzsche calls reversing causality.

635
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:27,320
I'm sorry, yeah, that was totally wrong.

636
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:33,800
They all, that is Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, and Nietzsche, don't make Lady, but everybody else does.

637
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:42,599
So we have to understand what that, why Nietzsche is saying that, and how it shows up in Kierkegaard and in Dostoevsky.

638
00:53:43,239 --> 00:53:47,960
So one of the, I'm not going to hit it head on.

639
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:56,920
The first thing he talks about is that, and they all would agree, is that religion isn't a matter of beliefs, but it's a way of acting.

640
00:53:57,159 --> 00:53:57,960
You can see that.

641
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,319
I mean, it's all over the place.

642
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:04,280
I mean, it isn't important whether Alyasha believes that there's a connection.

643
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,320
You could believe it and not do anything about it.

644
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:16,920
Or you could be constantly doing a thing, responding to this connectedness without noticing or reflecting on the fact that it's happening to you.

645
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,119
As far as I know, Alyasha doesn't even have any beliefs.

646
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:23,159
Do we know anything that Alyasha believes?

647
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,160
I guess.

648
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:30,239
No, I mean, I was going to say he believes that he performed a miracle with Grushenka, but he didn't say that.

649
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:32,079
Rakitin said he performed a miracle.

650
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:33,520
I mean, he feels he did.

651
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:36,799
It's just not something he has to think about and believe.

652
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:42,959
And if you believe that everything's connected to everything, but you don't do anything about it, that won't do either.

653
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:46,079
I'm just remembering something very, very funny.

654
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:48,640
It won't seem so funny to you because you won't be able to see it.

655
00:54:48,639 --> 00:55:02,320
I was studying in Lou Vince, studying Husserl, and Husserl papers are all in the archives of the Franciscan monks who saved the Husserl notes from the Nazis.

656
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:15,280
And the head of the Franciscan monks was Father von Breda, a very nice, fun-loving monk who was, and they were all in their brown cowls and their sandals and their rope belts and everything.

657
00:55:15,279 --> 00:55:17,680
And the Husserl archives was on the top floor.

658
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:21,119
And one day some poor dog wandered into the Husserl archives.

659
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,079
And Father van Breda kicked the dog down the stairs.

660
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:30,880
He says, that's a Franciscan who may well believe that you should love all the birds and the animals the way Franciscans do.

661
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,800
They're like Markle followers, but he certainly didn't practice it.

662
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:40,800
And then I noticed that, and this is the funniest part of all, when he would go in the courtyard, all the birds would fly in the other direction.

663
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:51,440
I mean, he says, this is just, this is exactly what you, but he probably believed all this, but he just didn't have anything to do with how he behaved.

664
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:51,679
Okay.

665
00:55:53,279 --> 00:55:54,000
What?

666
00:55:55,279 --> 00:55:56,000
He was preaching.

667
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:56,400
He was.

668
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,880
He was.

669
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,640
Why'd you say that?

670
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,760
Oh, yeah, but he preached what nice things, I suppose.

671
00:56:04,639 --> 00:56:10,320
I think he was teaching the dog how to behave better, not to go around and get in the Husserl archives.

672
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,799
Okay, so here I'm going back to where I was.

673
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:17,399
I suddenly transport myself into the happy days with Father Van Breda.

674
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,520
Let's see now.

675
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:26,440
Okay, so religion is not a matter of belief on 163 of the Antichrist.

676
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:27,400
He's saying.

677
00:56:27,639 --> 00:56:33,720
Okay, so, and let me see where I am.

678
00:56:33,719 --> 00:56:36,040
Oh, I'm trying to say too many things at once.

679
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,279
So, where do I see that it's a spontaneous religion?

680
00:56:38,279 --> 00:56:39,480
Is not a matter of beliefs?

681
00:56:39,719 --> 00:56:40,760
Oh, I see.

682
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:47,640
About 15 lines down on 163: genuine primitive Christianity will be possible at all times.

683
00:56:47,639 --> 00:56:49,720
Not a belief, but a doing.

684
00:56:49,719 --> 00:56:58,040
Well, you remember, Kierkegaard is trying to get back into what he thought the early Christians were before they got philosophy mixed into them.

685
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:02,599
Dostoevsky with Markle is trying to get back to what he thinks the early Christians were.

686
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:10,680
And they're not trying to understand what the early Christians believe, but the way, particularly Dostoevsky with Markle, but the way they acted.

687
00:57:10,679 --> 00:57:16,280
And they act spontaneously, they do the right thing.

688
00:57:16,279 --> 00:57:23,239
So, reading a little further, not a belief, but a doing, above all, a not doing of many things, of being a different being.

689
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:34,920
States of consciousness, beliefs of any kind, holding something to be true, for example, are a matter of complete indifference and of the fifth rank compared with the value of the instincts.

690
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:39,480
To speak more strictly, the whole concept of spiritual causality is false.

691
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:44,199
That means, remember, instincts for him means doing something just spontaneously.

692
00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:47,320
It means a good kind of lower immediacy.

693
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:56,280
And there's just no place in this for doing things on reflection because you decided that was the right thing for a Christian to do.

694
00:57:56,279 --> 00:58:04,480
And it means that you just spontaneously help your neighbor when your neighbor needs you.

695
00:57:59,639 --> 00:58:05,920
That's what it's about.

696
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:08,239
You don't have to believe anything to do that.

697
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:12,320
You don't have to be conscious that that's what you ought to be doing or anything like that.

698
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,240
You just naturally do it.

699
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:18,079
And that's how Nietzsche thinks the early Christian community was.

700
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:19,839
But of course, it didn't last very long.

701
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:24,960
Nietzsche thinks it was over before it got started.

702
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:33,040
And I think probably Kierkegaard and particularly Dostoevsky think it lasted a while, but they all agreed with that.

703
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,839
And now what's the reverse causality?

704
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:39,840
Well, the reverse causality is the thought that several things.

705
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:48,640
Here's the simplest one: that somehow believing something to be true can affect your sort of spiritual situation.

706
00:58:48,639 --> 00:59:01,839
By that I mean believing something like there is a Creator God, Christ died for our sins, God loves us, that if you believe that, you will be reborn, able to love, etc., etc.

707
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,440
You're certainly mistaken.

708
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:11,680
It isn't your beliefs don't cause you to feel this love and this rebirth, like Dimitri feels and so forth.

709
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:23,840
It's on the contrary, your experience of the love and your experience of this rebirth and coming out positive transformation of suffering and all that.

710
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:30,799
That's what causes you to have beliefs, if you happen to have any beliefs at all, but it doesn't matter whether you have any beliefs or not.

711
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,360
They are completely irrelevant.

712
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:38,559
Okay, that's, but there's a much more interesting story than that.

713
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:43,920
And it's more, you can see it better in Dostoevsky than you can see it in Kierkegaard.

714
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,040
So let's look at Dostoevsky.

715
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:55,079
In a way, Dostoevsky, oh, I didn't read you the reverse causality quote, which I better read you just because I didn't make it up on page 64.

716
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,679
I don't see it on 64.

717
00:59:56,679 --> 00:59:58,280
It must be very nearby.

718
00:59:58,279 --> 01:00:05,159
Well, it says in so many words that it's a mistake of reverse psychology.

719
01:00:05,159 --> 01:00:08,119
And it's in italics, reverse causality.

720
01:00:08,119 --> 01:00:09,480
I misspoke.

721
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,279
Whoa.

722
01:00:10,279 --> 01:00:12,440
Well, maybe it's an ear in 64.

723
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,040
I just, oh, no.

724
01:00:14,119 --> 01:00:16,360
Just let me look for a minute in the vicinity.

725
01:00:16,599 --> 01:00:17,319
Keep your eye open.

726
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,319
We're very near where I am.

727
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:23,480
I swear there's in the reverse.

728
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,960
This reverses the causality.

729
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,559
Well, maybe I'm getting this line.

730
01:00:27,559 --> 01:00:33,480
It's me that says reverses the causality, but the line is at the top of 64.

731
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,199
It has to be this.

732
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:39,400
Morality and religion fall entirely under the psychology of error.

733
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,840
In every single case, cause is mistaken for effect.

734
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:43,559
That's enough.

735
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:45,640
That is the reversing causality.

736
01:00:45,639 --> 01:00:50,520
That's more important than believing something saving your soul.

737
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:54,040
Because now it's a kind of philosophical thesis.

738
01:00:54,279 --> 01:00:59,079
The thesis is that cause is mistaken for effect.

739
01:00:59,079 --> 01:01:06,999
Now, think of it in terms of the big experience of love in the middle of the brothers' karamatsa.

740
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:22,040
Now, cause is mistaken for effect is the real cause that you are connected to everything is your experience of being connected to everything.

741
01:01:24,679 --> 01:01:29,000
That's the ground level, so to speak, experience.

742
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,479
And you can then, that you can take as an effect.

743
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:40,559
You can say, because God created all these worlds as interconnected, you feel this experience of interconnection.

744
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,000
That's the mistake.

745
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:47,359
What Dostoevsky thinks and what Nietzsche thinks is, you feel the experience of interconnection.

746
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,280
That's just basic.

747
01:01:49,279 --> 01:02:02,160
And it doesn't help and it doesn't add anything, and it really just confuses things to bring in God as having created this connectedness of everything.

748
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:04,160
Dostoevsky never says that.

749
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:09,040
Never says that Alyasha had any beliefs about the connectedness of everything at all.

750
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,960
That's the first point we were making.

751
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:19,520
But secondly, Dostoevsky doesn't say from his own point of view, aha, now we know what God is.

752
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,839
God is the connectedness of everything.

753
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,919
He's not the cause of the connected.

754
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,800
He didn't produce the connectedness.

755
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:32,559
Just as Kierkegaard, now we can see in Kierkegaard, says, God is that all things are possible.

756
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:37,599
That doesn't make a God, which then makes all things possible.

757
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:40,400
God is that all things are possible.

758
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:45,599
And what's interesting is this is a very, very important move.

759
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:51,520
Nietzsche is giving it a funny name, and you have to hardly, I can hardly get it myself when I look at the top of 64.

760
01:02:51,520 --> 01:03:10,320
But when you say the cause is taken as effect, you're really getting rid of the making an object and cause that you don't need behind the religious phenomena which we're trying to describe.

761
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:14,359
So God doesn't cause the soul that's isolated to be in hell.

762
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:18,759
Being isolated just is being in hell, and so forth and so forth.

763
01:03:19,719 --> 01:03:29,720
In other words, what Nietzsche calls getting the order of cause and effect wrong is what Dostoevsky is trying to correct by existentializing.

764
01:03:29,719 --> 01:03:45,000
Because his existentializing always takes away any sort of supreme being doing anything that you don't need and focuses on the experience and what people do when they have that experience, which is what you do need.

765
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:51,640
So that's why this whole thing is important to see how these three people all share some very deep idea.

766
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:58,999
They use very fancy terminology, which you don't have to know, but it might come in handy at cocktail parties or something.

767
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:02,680
They are all against onto theology.

768
01:04:03,559 --> 01:04:04,919
That's Heidegger jargon.

769
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:09,480
Onto theology is just that there's a supreme being behind it all.

770
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:16,360
The onto is being, and the theology is the science of God as the supreme being.

771
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,480
That's what has to be crossed out.

772
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:25,639
That's what came in from Plato and from metaphysics and partly and partly from the Old Testament.

773
01:04:25,639 --> 01:04:31,960
But the part that the really clear version of it is coming out of the Greeks.

774
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:37,239
And they are naming this is just, let me give you one more example.

775
01:04:37,239 --> 01:04:38,919
Then I'll let you say something.

776
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:45,880
I mean, what's on my mind right now is what isn't something that they talk about very much, but I'm writing about it.

777
01:04:46,439 --> 01:04:47,479
But it's interesting.

778
01:04:47,479 --> 01:04:50,040
People who think they have a calling.

779
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:58,840
They have a calling, meaning that they sense when they're doing what they need to be doing and that they must be doing, and they sense when they're deviating from it.

780
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:02,159
So Martin Luther King knew he had a calling.

781
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:16,960
Luther, who's behind all this calling talk more than anybody, knew that he had to stand up against the Catholic Church, which was a pretty amazing thing to do since the Catholic Church controlled everything and all intelligibility at the time that Luther was around.

782
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:23,359
And the interesting thing is, what these guys are saying is you can have a calling without a caller.

783
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,479
That is, you can have a sense of what you have to do.

784
01:05:26,479 --> 01:05:30,479
You can have a sense when you're doing it and feeling that you're on the beam.

785
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:33,840
You can have a sense when you're failing to do it and you're off the beam.

786
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:41,359
But you don't need, so to speak, a beamer, a light shine, something that shines this beam on you.

787
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:43,920
You just need that experience.

788
01:05:43,920 --> 01:06:01,839
And so that's, to me, right now, that's the most interesting one because in a recent book, Charles Taylor, who's a religious Catholic and a very good philosopher, goes from having a calling to getting his belief in a supreme being that's doing the calling.

789
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:06,960
Well, these three people would certainly want to say, block that move.

790
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,159
You don't need it.

791
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,319
Now, you want to say something?

792
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:10,800
What?

793
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:16,559
Just want to kind of feed back into the last question about chaos?

794
01:06:17,439 --> 01:06:19,599
What Nietzsche would say about chaos?

795
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,559
Is that what you're asking?

796
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:23,279
Is God, I mean, for Nietzsche.

797
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:26,719
Yeah.

798
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:29,519
Well, I think you're asking an interesting question.

799
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:31,840
So, yeah, God is, for Kierkegaard.

800
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:36,479
God is that all things are possible, not an object, not onto theology.

801
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:43,599
And for Dostoevsky, God is that all these worlds are connected, the worlds of love.

802
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,599
Now, for Nietzsche, what do you want to say?

803
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,839
That it's all chaos.

804
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:52,599
That's right.

805
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:53,559
That's right.

806
01:06:53,560 --> 01:07:01,719
But of course, for Nietzsche, he's not sort of opposing any wrong interpretation as far as whether anything created the chaos.

807
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:09,880
And he's not saying it's all chaos, but we don't need a supreme being to create the chaos, because nobody ever bothered to think that there was a supreme being.

808
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:29,079
But you're right in the sense that the bottom line for Nietzsche that does the same job as God is interconnectedness, or God is that all things are possible, is something like the universe is chaos, and there is no purpose, no why, and so forth.

809
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:42,599
There's a long list I didn't assign, I don't think, where he says the universe is not an organism, it's not a machine, it's not, I forget, it goes on and on about all the things the universe isn't, and then he just says it's chaos.

810
01:07:43,399 --> 01:07:50,199
Okay, so but he's not, but he didn't, it isn't as if he's correcting somebody who got the causality wrong.

811
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:51,960
He's just, you see what I mean?

812
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,479
Okay, how are we doing?

813
01:07:53,479 --> 01:07:54,519
Well, we've got some time.

814
01:07:54,519 --> 01:07:55,720
And did I see any other hand?

815
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:56,599
Yeah, Beatrice.

816
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,199
First, you said you have a calling?

817
01:07:58,279 --> 01:07:59,800
Is the situation of it?

818
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:18,760
Yeah, well, I mean, the way I try to describe it, when I talk to people who claim to have callings, which is what I was doing lately, it's, and Charles Taylor being one of them, that they have a sense that they're feeling that they are in a kind of bliss.

819
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:23,880
Their life is as full as it can be.

820
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:30,040
And I think Nietzsche won't like that, because I think they might think their life is as meaningful as it can be.

821
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:44,399
But whatever it is, they feel that they're doing something right, and that it's absolutely necessary for them to do that, no matter what havoc it might make, as it did in the case of Luther.

822
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:52,479
And they have another sense that even though they think they're doing something right, they're not doing something right, and they better shape up.

823
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:57,040
And prophets, all prophets have that, and Martin Luther King must have had it.

824
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:01,040
But you can be a much lesser version of it.

825
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:15,840
Any creative person, anybody who's sort of opening up new worlds will have that sense when they're doing it right and when they're doing what they have to do, being who they are.

826
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,199
So Kierkegaard's got it.

827
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:26,639
When you've got an unconditional commitment, you don't get this unconditional commitment by, see if this works.

828
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,319
Well, he doesn't spell it out.

829
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:38,559
You feel it, remember, twining about every ligament of your consciousness, and you feel that you can't tear it out or you'll lose yourself.

830
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,800
That's how it is in Kierkegaard.

831
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,159
But it's the same thing.

832
01:09:42,159 --> 01:09:46,079
It's an experience of something that's binding you.

833
01:09:46,079 --> 01:09:48,880
And you're letting yourself be bound.

834
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:51,359
And that's going to become who you are.

835
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,639
It is becoming who you are.

836
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,079
That's what it is to have a calling.

837
01:09:56,079 --> 01:09:57,920
But we shouldn't be talking about callings.

838
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,119
We should be stopping.

839
01:09:59,119 --> 01:10:01,519
Let me just be sure where I am, and we will.

840
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:03,519
Okay, you can go.

841
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,319
I have to figure out where I am.
