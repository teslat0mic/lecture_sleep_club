1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,520
I was talking about Alyasha and Yvonne, and then I jumped ahead to Dimitri just because I wanted to convince you that there really was a Kierkegaardian story about the self.

2
00:00:13,521 --> 00:00:16,880
Remember, and then here's another sort of thing I wanted to say.

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:27,681
The TAs tell me that I didn't make clear enough why we suddenly jumped from fear and trembling to that excerpt from sickness unto death about the self.

4
00:00:27,681 --> 00:00:28,720
And I think that's right.

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,241
I didn't make clear enough.

6
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:33,201
It's so obvious to me that I realized it.

7
00:00:33,521 --> 00:00:37,920
I tried putting myself in your shoes, and I realized it wasn't obvious at all.

8
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:43,681
But it has two functions, of which you only would know one at the beginning.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,120
It is amazing, abstract summary of the whole Kierkegaard picture, of which fear and trembling is a piece.

10
00:00:53,361 --> 00:00:56,321
And then you see the two sets of factors.

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:04,241
You hear a lot about the finite and the infinite, the temporal and eternal, but there you see how they are related to each other and how you have to take a stand on them.

12
00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:18,200
And then, of course, it's very important that you see that you have to take a stand, and you can't relate yourself to yourself without relating in a way that's not despairing, without relating to someone or something outside the self.

13
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:31,560
All that was supposed to be a kind of summary of the basic picture that Kierkegaard has of what human beings are and what human beings need and what they will get despair about if they don't get.

14
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,840
So I should have said it.

15
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,961
I'm saying it now.

16
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:45,560
And secondly, you should have, or if you haven't got it, get it from Beatrice, the self, the heart, in the brothers Karamatsov, because I want to refer to that a lot.

17
00:01:45,560 --> 00:02:03,801
Because it's an amazing, I don't know if it's a coincidence or what it is, but it's an amazing fact that the picture of the self that you get in the Kierkegaard passage is the same structure of the way the self relates to itself and to the world and others that you get in the brothers.

18
00:02:03,801 --> 00:02:13,080
So the other reason that we made this sort of crash change to the self passage is because it's a transition to the brothers.

19
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,560
And we're in the middle of that transition now.

20
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,761
We've talked about Yvonne and look at your self-picture.

21
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,760
Keep it in mind every once in a while.

22
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:29,160
And if you haven't got it with you, then now is the time to get another copy from Beatrice so you can have it in front of you while we talk.

23
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:43,560
Okay, we've already done the way that Yvonne thinks about the two aspects of the self: that's the base and the noble.

24
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:49,641
And I I don't know why I put them in the order I put them.

25
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:59,921
I I think, well, I do know why, because you start at the top on the right with Theodore, and he's this R1 of spiritlessness that we talked about.

26
00:03:00,241 --> 00:03:12,801
And then there ought to be a negative relation of the self to the self and the negative relation it will prioritize one part and reject the other part.

27
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:22,241
And that's so far we've seen that is Ivan with his notion of what's noble or lofty and what's base.

28
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:31,440
And those are the two aspects that he wants to not get together, of course, because he's a negative relation.

29
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,320
Those are the aspects one of which he wants to be and the other one he wants to get rid of and deny.

30
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,960
And of course it's a no-brainer question, but I'll ask it anyway.

31
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,640
Between the noble and the base, which does he want to be?

32
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:53,040
Noble, of course, and he's going to try to get rid of all the part of him that's base.

33
00:03:53,041 --> 00:04:14,160
And he, like everybody else, considers the base part the Taramatsov part, because that's, they think of it as like the old Taramatsov, lecturous and selfish and evil in all sorts of ways with no redeeming features.

34
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:19,280
Now, so there's something you should write onto your chart that's related to what I just said.

35
00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:30,401
It's clear that the column on the left, which is the base insect sodom and so forth column, is what everybody calls the Terematsov cell.

36
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,880
And you would really want to write it in in pencil.

37
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:37,200
I mean, not literally, but if you have a pencil, so much the better.

38
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:43,200
Because I'm not telling you that that's where the Karamatsov is going to stay over there on the left.

39
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:56,601
But for the whole first part of the book, anyway, Karamatsov is the name for the column on the left, which looks like something bad that you want to get rid of.

40
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:04,120
And the hint that it may not be something bad you want to get rid of comes with Zosima.

41
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,441
Because in Zosima's on the right there, it's not clear where to put him.

42
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,560
He's not any of these because he's already out of the problem.

43
00:05:15,721 --> 00:05:22,041
He would be sort of relating to himself, relating to another, but he doesn't really get described that way.

44
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,521
But he does have a view of the factors.

45
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,400
And you see, the factors for him are the earthly and the heavenly.

46
00:05:29,401 --> 00:05:36,040
And that's beginning to suggest that if you define the factors in the right way, you might be able to get them together.

47
00:05:36,041 --> 00:06:02,041
And that the people who can't get them together, like old Karamatsov, who doesn't even try, and Ivan, who's trying hard, and as you'll see as the book goes on, failing miserably to get rid of half, and Dimitri, who's despairingly trying to get it all together, the hope is that you could somehow get the factors together if you could only describe them in a way that made them compatible.

48
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,200
This is all the same as Kierkegaard.

49
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,681
You want the factors to support each other.

50
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:15,881
You want it to be the case that all the factors on the left and the factors on the right, you could say the more one, the more the other.

51
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:27,001
And you can hardly say the more base, the more noble, or the more insect, the more angel, or at the bottom, the more good or the more bad.

52
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:55,121
But you've got a hope of saying the more earthly the more heavenly and the more heavenly the more earthly and so you've got to keep an eye on that now let's sort of plug back in I mean that's meant to be a transition that I should have said, but it's probably just as well to say it now and not earlier, because until you have the Kierkegaard self and you read enough, oh, speaking of reading enough, aha, yes, be sure and read up to 279.

53
00:06:55,121 --> 00:06:59,121
That's not further than I said last time, but I didn't get there last time.

54
00:06:59,121 --> 00:07:02,081
But now I know I'm going to get there next time.

55
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,200
That's rebellion.

56
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:09,200
If you haven't read the chapter on rebellion, don't bother to come on Thursday because you won't understand the thing.

57
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,041
You've got to read the chapter.

58
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:14,880
You've got to ask yourself whether you agree with Yvonne or not.

59
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:16,481
That's how it's done.

60
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,721
And so that means you have to read up to 279.

61
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,761
You should be reading much further.

62
00:07:23,761 --> 00:07:28,481
But I'm saying this is the minimum.

63
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,761
If you haven't read more than that, you're heading for trouble.

64
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:32,481
Okay.

65
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:57,761
Now, connecting up, we talked about the fact that Alyasha and Yvonne, being both of them the sons of Sophia, who is a saintly, meek, Christian person who, as we'll get to later, has icons and worships them and so forth.

66
00:07:58,801 --> 00:08:04,401
They are both striving for purity, but there are these two different kinds of purity.

67
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:15,081
The kind of purity that tries to get rid of all with the dark stuff, and the kind of purity that tries to purify the dark stuff.

68
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,161
And that Yvonne is one of them.

69
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:19,880
His kind of purity is like dry cleaning.

70
00:08:20,121 --> 00:08:22,361
You get rid of the bad elements.

71
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,521
He's really into cleanliness.

72
00:08:24,521 --> 00:08:36,361
I picture him, I haven't really reread it with this in mind, as always natally dressed, impeccable, with a recent haircut and so forth.

73
00:08:36,521 --> 00:08:39,881
That's just, he's always trying to be impeccable.

74
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,120
Any sort of bad thing, he wants to get rid of it.

75
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:49,881
He wants to be just the noble, lofty side.

76
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,200
That's what he wants.

77
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,641
And he wants to get rid of the lackey side, the base side.

78
00:08:58,281 --> 00:09:03,481
And so he's a negative R2.

79
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,841
He relates himself to himself as trying to get rid of everything he doesn't like about himself.

80
00:09:11,001 --> 00:09:16,841
And so he is, in Kierkegaard jargon, in despair at not willing to be himself.

81
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:26,521
Or I think the same thing is desperately not willing to be himself, meaning desperately not willing to be the part of himself that he doesn't like.

82
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:28,281
He wants to be an angel.

83
00:09:28,281 --> 00:09:36,841
Now, remember Pascal says that we're neither angel nor brute, and he who plays the angel plays the brute.

84
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:42,921
That you could carve over Yvonne's tombstone if he had died in the course of the book, which he doesn't quite.

85
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,921
And he's very dangerous.

86
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:50,841
And that's all I want to say about him for the time being.

87
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:59,041
And then there's the plur p the purity of sublimation, taking up and transforming the impurities.

88
00:09:58,521 --> 00:10:01,601
Alyasha is trying to be pure in that way.

89
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,201
He would like to be able to accept all of his impulses.

90
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,881
However, he's not succeeding at the beginning of the book.

91
00:10:10,881 --> 00:10:13,921
In fact, not succeeding really in the course of this book.

92
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:20,081
It must be something that happens in the next in volume two.

93
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,121
But he makes a lot of progress in the course of the book.

94
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:44,481
And that, and now, just to remind you of the whole structure of the Course, so Yvonne is a kind of Greek form of purity because he's trying to get there by saying only part of him is essentially him, and part of him is stuff that he's trying to deny and get rid of and say isn't him.

95
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:49,681
And Alyasha is a kind, and you could say Yvonne is a kind of Plato.

96
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,481
And there's some place in here where Muava mus mus muse musov?

97
00:10:56,641 --> 00:10:57,681
I can't say it right now.

98
00:10:57,681 --> 00:10:58,080
What?

99
00:10:59,041 --> 00:10:59,841
Muazov.

100
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:05,361
Yeah, Muazov says that Yvonne has an idea.

101
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,161
I mean, in Plato, that's Platonic thought.

102
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:22,001
There's no doubt that he's, and Plato says you should die to your body, and Yvonne would like to die to the lackey side of him, which is mostly very close to his body, but also all of his stupidities of his.

103
00:11:22,001 --> 00:11:24,641
And Alyasha is trying to be pure like Jesus.

104
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:27,840
He's like the Judeo-Christian side, or really just the Christian.

105
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,921
They don't think it's a Hebrew problem.

106
00:11:29,921 --> 00:11:40,641
He's trying to be pure like Jesus, and that's the sense in which they are similar, trying to be pure and super different in their approach to how to do it.

107
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:46,041
Another way to put it, Yvonne is passionately trying to be lofty and dispassionate.

108
00:11:47,001 --> 00:11:53,560
There's a kind of contradiction in what he's doing because you remember he wants to be a spectator of everything.

109
00:11:53,560 --> 00:12:00,681
That's going to turn out to be all very important and clear next time when we read the chapter on rebellion.

110
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:11,241
He wants with all his might to make him, and passionately he wants to make himself detached, eternal, infinite, and impeccable.

111
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:23,560
Now, remember a question left over from last time, and something that I find just fascinating and fun about the book, is that they've all got their doubles.

112
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:44,281
And we've seen already that the spiritlessness one of staying in a kind of complete dither and craziness, diversion, in order not to think about whether you've got an immortal soul or not, and so forth, that old Karamatsov has it, and his double, though I don't even know if they ever speak to each other.

113
00:12:44,281 --> 00:12:45,400
They know each other.

114
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:46,921
They live in the same little town.

115
00:12:46,921 --> 00:12:51,560
But they don't have to know each other to have the same approach to their selves.

116
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,960
They both have spiritlessness.

117
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,921
That is, they are not facing up to the problem of having a self.

118
00:12:58,921 --> 00:13:01,241
And we talked about that already.

119
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:09,721
So, and now the question is: who's the existential double of Yvonne?

120
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,641
That would be somebody trying to be perfect and lofty and better than everybody else.

121
00:13:17,001 --> 00:13:21,081
And it would have to be a woman, and it would have to be somebody involved with Yvonne.

122
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,121
Now you could be able to get anybody.

123
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:27,241
How about a woman involved with Yvonne and Dimitri?

124
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,681
Yeah, Katerina.

125
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:30,641
I know this.

126
00:13:30,641 --> 00:13:32,081
She's the double.

127
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,881
And she's trying to be lofty and better than everybody else.

128
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:45,761
I'll read you just a few quotes because she is somebody I just haven't got the time to talk about this very few minutes.

129
00:13:45,761 --> 00:13:47,681
I'm just doing it now.

130
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:57,121
She's a possible paper topic because there's lots to be said about Katerina and her way of having a self and whether it works or not.

131
00:13:57,121 --> 00:14:03,600
And it's fine if you do it, but I couldn't do it because there just isn't time.

132
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,921
I can't even find why I can't.

133
00:14:05,921 --> 00:14:07,200
I don't understand this.

134
00:14:07,521 --> 00:14:08,801
Very strange.

135
00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:14,560
I put down one wrong page number, two wrong page numbers.

136
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,841
Let's hope when I get to page 58, I've got the right page number or we won't have any.

137
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:25,121
Ah, yeah, 58 will do, about a quarter of the way down.

138
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,041
Somebody is saying, doesn't matter who, about Katerina, how she wants to be perceived.

139
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,921
Oh, she is such a fine, wonderful creature.

140
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:37,601
If only for her suffering.

141
00:14:37,601 --> 00:14:40,881
Think what she's gone through, and so forth and so forth.

142
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:46,480
She wants to be this very, very special person.

143
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,321
And I do wish I had the other one.

144
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:54,080
There's a place where Dimitri blurts out, and you can find it when you're reading.

145
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,440
It isn't important stuff, and I'm not going to spend time looking for it.

146
00:14:58,081 --> 00:15:05,360
Dimitri sort of says all she really wants to do is she loves herself and she wants to be perfect.

147
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:08,881
And then he realizes that he shouldn't have sort of blurted that out.

148
00:15:08,881 --> 00:15:11,040
But that's true about her.

149
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:13,681
That's the Yvonne side of her.

150
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,921
That's why Yvonne loves her.

151
00:15:16,921 --> 00:15:22,440
These people love each other because they've got the same existential perspective.

152
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:24,681
I want to mark those pages.

153
00:15:25,321 --> 00:15:28,521
Now, we're ready to go back to Dimitri in order.

154
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,960
Remember, I jumped ahead.

155
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:49,881
I'm not going to repeat what happens, but we talked last time about how on page 73, when he comes on, he comes on as a living, walking contradiction, old and young, muscular and sallow, vague and determined, stern and laughing.

156
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:57,960
And that's on the top of 74 because he's of an unstable and unbalanced mind at the end of the top paragraph.

157
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:06,280
And that is, he's a walking contradiction and trying to get it together and not succeeding.

158
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,081
That's what we see.

159
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:13,401
And now, more about him.

160
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:17,320
Well, he's this contradiction in an extreme form.

161
00:16:17,321 --> 00:16:20,280
And now we can look at the self again.

162
00:16:20,601 --> 00:16:23,000
He's got these versions now.

163
00:16:23,401 --> 00:16:28,601
His factors are insect and angel, Sodom and Madonna.

164
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:37,320
And what's interesting about the way he's got these factors is that he sees that they're both essential.

165
00:16:37,321 --> 00:16:43,960
He's not trying to just prove that he is noble and lofty and impeccable and get rid of the other side.

166
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,840
He sees that he can't get rid of either side.

167
00:16:46,841 --> 00:16:53,080
And he's got a kind of despair version of the more one, the more the other.

168
00:16:53,081 --> 00:17:04,401
He says that when he's plunging into his sensuality, he, I hope I got the right page for this one.

169
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,040
Yes, on 122.

170
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:20,720
You can see him saying the more he's base, the more he's noble, only those aren't his terms, the more he's indulging in sensuality and sodom, the more he's being spiritual and loving the Madonna.

171
00:17:21,601 --> 00:17:25,760
And he says that, where does he say it?

172
00:17:26,081 --> 00:17:28,960
Somewhere around 121, 122.

173
00:17:29,601 --> 00:17:31,760
Let's look on 120.

174
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:40,960
He quotes this insect thing, and then he says, all the Karamatsovs, the middle of the page, are such insects.

175
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,881
You see, that's where Karamatsov gets put on the left column.

176
00:17:44,881 --> 00:17:48,641
And he says, God sets before us nothing but riddles.

177
00:17:48,641 --> 00:17:53,280
The boundaries meet, and the contradictions exist side by side.

178
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:00,881
And not even side by side, if you skip down a little, but they support, they promote each other, these contradictions.

179
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:12,960
About ten lines from the bottom, beauty, I can't bear the thought of a man of lofty mind and heart, that a man with lofty mind and heart begins with the ideal of the Madonna and ends with the ideal of Sodom.

180
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:21,281
What's still more awful is that now is where you get the two so intimately connected that you can't even think of getting rid of one or the other.

181
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,520
That's why he's a case of desperately trying to get them together.

182
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,121
That's why he's an R too positive.

183
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,881
Let's go on.

184
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:42,240
I can't bear it that I can't bear the thought that a man of lofty mind and heart begins with the ideal of the Madonna and ends with the ideal of Sodom.

185
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,200
What's still more awful is that a man with the ideal of Sodom in his soul does not renounce the ideal of the Madonna.

186
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,161
You see, that would be negative relating.

187
00:18:51,161 --> 00:18:57,161
And his heart may be on fire with that ideal, genuinely on fire, just as in his days of youth.

188
00:18:57,161 --> 00:19:01,080
Yes, man is too broad, too broad, I'd have him narrower.

189
00:19:01,081 --> 00:19:08,760
And the famous line at the end of the chapter: God and the devil are fighting there for the thought.

190
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,200
Fighting, and the battlefield is the heart of man.

191
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:17,240
That's sort of not very, I mean, that's a sort of dramatic way to put it.

192
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:25,881
It's not so much that they're flipping back and forth in the heart of man, and that's the interesting part.

193
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:32,040
And then he goes on being a bug and being full of baseness.

194
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,080
Where's this?

195
00:19:33,401 --> 00:19:35,081
I can't find what I want.

196
00:19:35,081 --> 00:19:50,281
But at the very moment when he's going into his sort of heads up, I mean, feet up, heads down into his sensuality, he's already beginning his praise of the Madonna.

197
00:19:50,921 --> 00:19:52,600
Now we have to find that.

198
00:19:52,921 --> 00:19:55,080
Let's see if I can find it.

199
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,841
120.

200
00:19:57,161 --> 00:19:58,520
Help me find it.

201
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:09,401
He says the most terrible thing, even more than what he says here, is how he begins a hymn of praise to the Madonna just as he's sinking into the viciousness.

202
00:20:11,561 --> 00:20:12,841
Somebody will find it.

203
00:20:13,321 --> 00:20:14,200
Maybe not.

204
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,040
Maybe, I mean, it's there.

205
00:20:16,401 --> 00:20:18,921
I'll take one more look and then I will give up.

206
00:20:18,921 --> 00:20:19,881
Well, I don't know.

207
00:20:19,881 --> 00:20:35,200
But it's clearly his view, and I've got you enough quotes to tell you that as the very time, the more he's plunging into his sensuality, the more he's also feeling his spirituality at the very same time.

208
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,681
And that's what he, and he can't get rid of either one because they're both essential.

209
00:20:39,681 --> 00:20:42,080
That's his picture.

210
00:20:42,081 --> 00:20:58,720
Now, that makes him a very interesting case, the case of the despair of recognizing the true nature of the self and recognizing that both factors are essential and not being able to get them together.

211
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:14,080
And now you understand, if you see that, why Zosima does this amazing, strange thing that he does in his cell after he's heard from all the Karamatsovs freaking out in various ways.

212
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:20,080
What's the last move that Zosima makes that everybody's very puzzled about?

213
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,960
Yeah, he bows down until that forehead touched the floor in front of Dmitry.

214
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,881
And we have to look at where that happens because lots of interesting things happen at once there.

215
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,240
Okay, at the bottom of 81.

216
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:43,921
Father Zosima rose from his seat, almost distracted with anxiety for the elder Alyasha, supported him by the arm.

217
00:21:43,921 --> 00:21:48,000
I put it there because Alyasha is always so involved.

218
00:21:48,000 --> 00:22:01,120
Remember that I read last time where Ivan was watching this whole scene in the cell and like a reporter, which is his job, and he doesn't try to jump up and help Zosima, but naturally, Alyasha does.

219
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:05,360
And then Zosima goes to Dmitri, and they thought he was falling from weakness.

220
00:22:05,361 --> 00:22:10,800
But the elder distinctly and deliberately bowed down at Dmitry's feet till his forehead touched the floor.

221
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:17,161
And Alyasha, and now this is typical of Dostoevsky, who loves to make these sort of verisimilitude remarks.

222
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:18,760
He loved Dickens because Dickens did.

223
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:26,361
I mean, he just adds at the end there something not at all necessary for all this fancy psychology and philosophy, but just reality.

224
00:22:26,361 --> 00:22:31,000
He says Alyasha was so astonished that he failed to help him when he got up again.

225
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,161
And that's neat.

226
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:38,360
And now the question is: why did he bow down like that?

227
00:22:38,361 --> 00:22:45,000
And the answer is: Zosima says, he bows down for the great suffering in store for him.

228
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,080
I won't find you the quote because I don't know where it is.

229
00:22:49,641 --> 00:22:52,841
But that's, I explained that already.

230
00:22:52,841 --> 00:23:02,040
I mean, he's got the extremist form of the difficulty of being a human being short of getting out of it, which namely getting out of it.

231
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,080
He's got the most extreme form of despair.

232
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:25,800
Once you realize that the two sides of the self are not only both essential, but sort of reinforce each other, and you want to get them together, but they're a contradiction, as well as reinforcing each other, you're in real trouble, and you're in despair, and that's where he is.

233
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,361
Now, how about Dmitry stuff?

234
00:23:28,361 --> 00:23:32,440
Well, you always have to ask yourself, who is the girlfriend?

235
00:23:33,081 --> 00:23:34,440
It can't be Katerina.

236
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,440
She's really taken by Ivan, and that's how it has to be.

237
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,840
They both got the lofty, impeccable approach.

238
00:23:42,841 --> 00:23:46,201
So, who's Dmitry's real girlfriend?

239
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,801
The one he's really, really Grushenka.

240
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,161
Right, Grushenka.

241
00:23:51,161 --> 00:24:16,161
So, you'd expect to find somewhere, once you get on this sort of existential kluke trap, that Grushenka has the same thing as Dmitry about the self, namely that it has two factors, one good and one bad, and that the period well and that, they're both essential.

242
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:22,081
So we find her on this I have to skip way ahead to 510, but it won't spoil the plot.

243
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:25,200
It's just that happens to be where she says it.

244
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,041
And it goes by very quickly.

245
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,601
The Dostyvsky's got it always in here.

246
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,600
He's, I mean, instead of the insect, she says she's a beast at the second one.

247
00:24:35,681 --> 00:24:38,241
I'm a beast, that's what I am, but I want to pray.

248
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,760
That's the Madonna part.

249
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,361
I gave, never mind the onion.

250
00:24:41,361 --> 00:24:42,720
We don't know what that means right now.

251
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,360
Wicked as I've been, I want to pray.

252
00:24:45,361 --> 00:24:46,960
And then let them dance.

253
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,280
And then the summit up at the end of that little paragraph or halfway through it.

254
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,080
Though we're bad, the world's all right.

255
00:24:54,081 --> 00:24:56,320
We're good and bad, good and bad.

256
00:24:56,321 --> 00:25:00,320
That's in her simple, direct way.

257
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:07,681
She's got this thing, which same thing that Dimitri's got with poetry and insects and angels and Madonna's and Sodom.

258
00:25:07,681 --> 00:25:10,960
She's just got it in its basic form.

259
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,121
We're good and bad both.

260
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,681
And it's okay.

261
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,921
That's what she's saying at that point.

262
00:25:17,921 --> 00:25:25,440
And so that's on the chart where we get Grushenka down at the bottom where you get good and bad.

263
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,440
And she said someplace else.

264
00:25:27,601 --> 00:25:29,120
I don't think it's right here.

265
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,480
But she says, I'm a beast, but I want to pray.

266
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:43,800
That's the same thing as the I'm going into Dimitri's, I'm falling, I'm plunging headfirst into sensuality, but I'm loving the Madonna all the same.

267
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,921
Even the more sensual, the more I love the Madonna.

268
00:25:43,121 --> 00:25:48,041
She's got the same thing.

269
00:25:48,361 --> 00:25:52,761
Naturally, she's got it because that's her job, so to speak.

270
00:25:53,401 --> 00:25:55,960
Existential double for them, for him.

271
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,321
Anyone want to say anything?

272
00:25:57,321 --> 00:26:06,040
I'm just going sort of talking on because there's a lot to say, and the structure of the book is so amazingly rich.

273
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,001
I mean, there's so much more going on than anybody knows.

274
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:19,241
I'm sure so much more going on than I know, because every once in a while, a whole new thing, I'll tell you when I get there, a student will say to me, and I'll realize that, sorry, I've been missing 20% of the book.

275
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,641
It happened a few years ago.

276
00:26:21,641 --> 00:26:28,520
But anyway, by the way, I just read the foreword and the afterword of the version of the book that you've got.

277
00:26:28,841 --> 00:26:34,280
There's nothing wrong or stupid about them, but there's absolutely nothing illuminating about them either.

278
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:41,800
They sort of see the structure all in very vainal, very murky and, well, vanal terms.

279
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,481
So read them if you like.

280
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,841
There's lots of sort of interesting facts about the life of Dostoevsky in there.

281
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,840
I don't think that they're going to cast any helpful light.

282
00:26:52,841 --> 00:26:56,120
Okay, back to the next one in the family.

283
00:26:56,121 --> 00:26:58,520
So now, what have we got?

284
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,881
We're getting ready to go on to Alyasha.

285
00:27:01,881 --> 00:27:15,240
But just want to, in passing, tell you, get you to sort of recognize, remember I said these brothers are very much your age, but the ages of the brothers play an important significant role.

286
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,121
So I'm going to read this.

287
00:27:16,121 --> 00:27:17,480
I'm 16.

288
00:27:18,841 --> 00:27:21,801
Alexey, that's Alyasha, was only 20.

289
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:29,200
His brother Ivonne was in his 24th year at the time, while their elder half-brother Dimitri was 27.

290
00:27:28,601 --> 00:27:32,401
And so Alexei or Alyasha and so forth.

291
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:43,200
And that's, we're going to find out pretty soon that there's another brother the same age as Yvonne, but I don't want to talk about it yet.

292
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,200
So, but I do want to talk about something funny that happens right here.

293
00:27:47,921 --> 00:27:55,840
The omniscient narrator is still around showing his stupidity here early in the book.

294
00:27:55,841 --> 00:28:02,081
When you go, it goes on and says, they were all fond of Alyasha.

295
00:28:02,081 --> 00:28:04,000
He wasn't a mystic, that's true.

296
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,841
I may as well give my full opinion.

297
00:28:06,641 --> 00:28:09,200
He was simply a lover of humanity.

298
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:18,480
And that he adopted the monastic life was because it struck him as an ideal escape for his soul, struggling from the darkness of the world, the light of love.

299
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,560
Well, that's half right.

300
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,200
But he wasn't a lover of humanity.

301
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,881
Being a lover of humanity would be to love all human beings.

302
00:28:28,881 --> 00:28:41,040
And if you understand anything about sort of Christianity and Alyasha as a Christian, he loves each particular human being that he's with.

303
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:48,161
But Ivan says at some point that he loves humanity, but he can't stand particular people, any particular people.

304
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:50,960
He's very disdainful and aloof.

305
00:28:50,960 --> 00:29:04,080
The point is, Alyasha loves the particular people that he comes in contact with, all of them, even old Karamatsov, who says to him at one point, you're the only one who doesn't despise me and condemn me.

306
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:11,280
But it just shows how sort of stupid the commentator is.

307
00:29:12,081 --> 00:29:20,520
He's not a lover of humanity, he's a lover of, you could say it in Christian terms, his neighbor, whoever that may be, at whatever time.

308
00:29:21,401 --> 00:29:23,000
And now where are we?

309
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:33,161
So Alyasha has a problem with the sensual, which what he considers the dark side of himself.

310
00:29:33,161 --> 00:29:38,040
And he hasn't resolved it.

311
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:47,960
In that way, he is sort of like Yvonne, except that where Yvonne knows how to resolve it, in his idea, get rid of it, deny it, and so forth.

312
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,320
Alyasha doesn't, so to speak, know what to do about it.

313
00:29:51,321 --> 00:29:58,840
So he just tries to not have to face it, but not by distracting himself, but in a funny way.

314
00:29:58,841 --> 00:30:00,681
Let's see where it is now.

315
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,960
Yeah, on 19 is where you hear about it.

316
00:30:07,321 --> 00:30:18,120
And you hear a lot about the sensual side of Alyasha and how he is not repressing it, because that would be sort of like denying it, which is what Yvonne is trying to do.

317
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,440
He just doesn't know how to cope with it.

318
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,760
And that's as far as he's gotten.

319
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:32,040
On 19, about 10 lines down, he talks about the fact that he had a wild fanatical modesty and chastity.

320
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:36,280
He could not bear to hear certain words and certain conversations about women.

321
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:43,080
There are certain words and conversations unhappily impossible to eradicate in schools, of schoolboys.

322
00:30:43,081 --> 00:30:58,480
And so, then skipping down to the second paragraph, seeing that Alyasha Karamatsov put his fingers in his ears when they talked of that, his schoolfellows crowded around, pulled his hands away, and shouted nastiness into both ears while he struggled and fell to the floor.

323
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:03,681
And that's just, he just doesn't know how to deal with this.

324
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:16,401
And you'll find out more later when I don't think I wrote it down here, but you have to bear it in mind when Rakit tells him.

325
00:31:16,401 --> 00:31:18,080
I'm surprised I don't have it with him.

326
00:31:18,161 --> 00:31:18,801
Maybe I do.

327
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,161
We'll see if I get there.

328
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:35,360
So anyway, we've seen this: that Alyasha has got this dangerous side, and Rakitin tells him he's a Karamatsov and a centralist like everybody else.

329
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:50,401
And Alyasha gets all very upset because he says he knows it's true that he's a Karamatsov, and that means he got this dangerous, dark, destructive impulses.

330
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,961
Okay, so now let's see, I'm 16.

331
00:31:54,961 --> 00:31:56,961
I think that's what I just read.

332
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:05,601
Yeah, and when I said that he's no lover of humanity, I said that the other half of that sentence is true.

333
00:32:05,601 --> 00:32:09,840
He's struggling from the darkness of worldly wickedness to the light of love.

334
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,761
He says that himself.

335
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:23,761
That means that he's not yet understood how to integrate the dark side and the other side in some positive way.

336
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:29,520
And that's why on the chart, when you get to Alyasha, you don't have Alyasha on the chart.

337
00:32:30,001 --> 00:32:31,520
Or really, you do at the bottom.

338
00:32:31,521 --> 00:32:34,480
There are two ways to talk about Alyasha.

339
00:32:34,481 --> 00:32:36,960
One is that he's got a defining commitment.

340
00:32:36,961 --> 00:32:37,921
We'll get to that.

341
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:42,240
But what I think we should write into the chart, I wrote it into mine.

342
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,521
I will change it the next time I give it out.

343
00:32:44,521 --> 00:32:48,681
There is where we talk right before base and noble.

344
00:32:48,681 --> 00:32:51,720
You should add dark and light.

345
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,601
There's the darkness, and there's the light.

346
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,041
There's the darkness of the world and the light of the spiritual.

347
00:32:58,041 --> 00:33:07,961
And Alyasha belongs there in a kind of R2 because he's trying to go in the monastery to get to the light and get out of the darkness.

348
00:33:07,961 --> 00:33:09,880
I mean, he says it on his own terms.

349
00:33:11,081 --> 00:33:17,640
When the narrator says we could believe it, he's a soul struggling from the darkness of worldly wickedness to the light of love.

350
00:33:17,641 --> 00:33:20,921
That's how he understands it at this point.

351
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,601
That would make him a negative.

352
00:33:24,601 --> 00:33:32,121
Get rid of the darkness, go to the monastery, leave the dark behind, go to where Sasam is, and everybody loves each other.

353
00:33:32,121 --> 00:33:36,921
That's not satisfactory, of course, because you've got to get it together.

354
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,841
So let me see now.

355
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:49,400
He enters the monastery on 37 for this very reason, to get out of the 26.

356
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,320
I have so many different versions of this.

357
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,001
It drives me crazy.

358
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:59,641
But on 26, but I'll never use this version again because of the way it left out that part I passed out to you.

359
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:01,561
Not pardonable.

360
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:10,281
So I'll read you again what the omniscient narrator says, but I do think it's true about him.

361
00:34:10,601 --> 00:34:12,761
The first paragraph on 26.

362
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:19,001
I shall be told perhaps that Alyasha was stupid, undeveloped, not finished in his studies, that he'd not, and so forth.

363
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:32,240
I'll simply repeat, as I have said, he entered upon this path into the monastery because at that time it alone struck his imagination and seemed to him to offer an ideal means of escape for his soul from darkness to light.

364
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,481
I mean, escape is, of course, the clue.

365
00:34:34,481 --> 00:34:51,441
If you go to the monastery to escape some aspect of the world in yourself, you're not facing up to what your job is, is to somehow integrate them, purify them, not hold your ears and run into the monastery.

366
00:34:51,441 --> 00:34:55,920
So Alyasha has a lot to learn and a long way to go.

367
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:04,481
But there's this fascinating comparison between him, about him and Yvonne, that I want you to read.

368
00:35:04,481 --> 00:35:10,081
If I can get this book untangled from the other ones, just a second.

369
00:35:10,081 --> 00:35:10,720
Yeah.

370
00:35:12,001 --> 00:35:15,200
At the bottom, there are two different things.

371
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,960
Don't let me confuse you.

372
00:35:16,961 --> 00:35:24,160
I am going to talk about how he's different from Yvonne, but then I'm going to talk about another way that he's different from Dimitri.

373
00:35:24,161 --> 00:35:27,601
But this is how he's different from Yvonne at the bottom of 19.

374
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:40,561
Remember that they both have the same condition, that they've been living off relatives who had to take them in because their mother died and old Karamatsov just abandons them.

375
00:35:40,561 --> 00:35:45,921
On what terms he lived with them, these relatives, he didn't know himself.

376
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,641
It was very characteristic of him that he never cared.

377
00:35:48,641 --> 00:35:53,760
Now, consider this contrast with Yvonne, who was so embarrassed by having to be dependent on these people.

378
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:00,001
He wanted to be self-sufficient and impeccable, and here he was sort of treated as a scruffy relative.

379
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:02,720
But he didn't care at whose expense he was living.

380
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:19,880
In what respect, in that respect, he was a striking contrast to his elder brother Yvonne, who struggled with poverty for the first two years in the university, supported himself, and from childhood and had been, had from childhood been bitterly conscious of living at the expense of his benefactor.

381
00:36:21,641 --> 00:36:25,880
And this is all the way Alyasha is sort of saintly already.

382
00:36:25,961 --> 00:36:27,240
The bottom of that paragraph.

383
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:36,761
When he was given pocket money that he didn't ask for, he was terribly careless with it so that it was gone or he kept it for weeks not knowing what to do with it.

384
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:44,840
And what happens is then everybody takes care of him, everybody loves him, he doesn't ever have to buy any food or find any place to stay.

385
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,921
People are just happy to have him around.

386
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:58,760
Now, at the bottom of 21, Alyasha arrival.

387
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:08,040
I just want to, I was looking for a quote about old Karamatsov that I didn't find, but I found it now, and it comes right here with Alyasha, so I'll put it in.

388
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:10,280
You can push it back with old Karamatsov.

389
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:26,761
It says, Alyasha's arrival seemed to make him, that's old Karamatsov, make his moral side, sorry, seem to affect even his moral side, as though something had awakened in this prematurely old man which had long been dead in his soul.

390
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,961
That's another way of saying spiritlessness.

391
00:37:29,961 --> 00:37:41,801
And when Alyasha's around, old Karamatsov worries about, admits that he worries about heaven and hell, and that he's got this side that he's trying not to think about.

392
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:48,121
So on 24, he goes on the typical of not thinking about it, old Karamatsov.

393
00:37:48,121 --> 00:37:55,081
He says, I keep thinking about hell, and then I will the devils drag me down with their hooks?

394
00:37:55,081 --> 00:37:56,200
But then, what about hooks?

395
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,240
Where do they get them?

396
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,640
Are they iron hooks?

397
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,601
How do they forge them?

398
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:06,481
I mean, this is how not to think about the seriousness of whether he's going to hell or not.

399
00:38:06,481 --> 00:38:08,880
And that's his way of distracting himself.

400
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,281
But it's clear that he's worried about it.

401
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:24,160
And on the top of 25, the quote that I mentioned but didn't write down, he says, I feel that you're the only, I feel that you're the only creature in the world who has not condemned me, my boy.

402
00:38:24,481 --> 00:38:28,240
And that's interesting.

403
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,321
Okay, now where am I?

404
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,321
So compared to Dmitry, we've just talked about that.

405
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,441
He's self-sufficient.

406
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:41,200
I mean, not making any sense at all.

407
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,321
Compared to Yvonne, Alyasha is happy to depend on everybody.

408
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:56,240
And while Yvonne wants to be self-sufficient, now I'm switching to another thing, comparing him to Dmitry.

409
00:38:56,561 --> 00:39:08,240
That's really interesting, because this brings out the sensual, common sensuality, common Karamatsov-in-ness in the two of them.

410
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,921
And that's on page 121.

411
00:39:12,481 --> 00:39:17,120
Dimitri is going on and on about how bad he is at the bottom of 121.

412
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:19,200
I loved cruelty.

413
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,240
Am I not a bug?

414
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,920
Am I not a poisonous insect?

415
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,681
In fact, I'm a Karamatsov.

416
00:39:23,681 --> 00:39:24,801
That again.

417
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,801
But he says now at a new issue on 123.

418
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:36,160
Though I'm full of baseness and love, what's and love what's low, I'm not dishonorable.

419
00:39:36,161 --> 00:39:37,361
You're blushing.

420
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,521
Enough of this filth with you.

421
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,080
And now comes what I want to lead up to.

422
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,520
Below the middle of 122, Alyasha admits that he's got the same impulses.

423
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,720
You say that because I blushed, Alyasha said suddenly.

424
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:56,361
I wasn't blushing at what you were saying or what you've done.

425
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:00,200
I blushed because I'm the same as you, the same as you are.

426
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:00,841
You?

427
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,601
That's a little too far.

428
00:40:02,601 --> 00:40:04,681
No, it's true, insisted Alyasha.

429
00:40:04,681 --> 00:40:06,521
Obviously, the idea was not new.

430
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:07,881
The ladder's the same.

431
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:12,200
I'm at the bottom step, and you're above somewhere about the 13th.

432
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,120
That is so strange that I have to talk about it a minute.

433
00:40:16,601 --> 00:40:36,441
It looks like he's trying to say that Yvonne is in some way better than he is, higher up than he is, because Yvonne is more sensual, more disgusting, more cruel, more despairing than he is, than he, Alyasha, is.

434
00:40:36,441 --> 00:40:50,681
And that's a very interesting sort of Christian and Kierkegaardian too, of course, therefore, theme, that you've got to go all the way into despair before you can fight your way out.

435
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:55,960
And Alyasha is in effect admitting that he hasn't faced up to his sensuality.

436
00:40:55,961 --> 00:41:00,281
He's thought about it, but he hasn't acted on it.

437
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:14,281
Yvonne has acted on it and hates himself for it and can't resist and yet knows that somehow he's being dragged down and so forth.

438
00:41:14,601 --> 00:41:20,841
So, in a funny way, you've got to go down before you can go up in this Christian picture.

439
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:25,961
And you see it in formal terms in the despair chart.

440
00:41:25,961 --> 00:41:37,761
And you see it if you would read the divine Comedy, you would see that Dante has to go to the bottom of the inferno before he can climb up purgatory and get to paradise.

441
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:59,681
Or you see it in a strange way in Third Man, where this reversibleness of up and down of the porter, and then the guy burying, the priest burying the supposed hairy line, is reading the passage that Jesus descended into hell for three days.

442
00:41:59,681 --> 00:42:01,841
Now, why in the world did he do that?

443
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:18,801
And, well, he did it because it's part of the idea of being really the most fulfilled human being that you've got to confront the dark side and somehow make it not dark anymore.

444
00:42:19,521 --> 00:42:23,600
And you have to go through the, but to do that, you have to go through the despair.

445
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:28,400
I've got it explained, but I do I have it later?

446
00:42:28,561 --> 00:42:30,001
Must be earlier.

447
00:42:31,521 --> 00:42:37,601
You can see it best in Madame Holokoff's way of dealing with Zosima.

448
00:42:37,601 --> 00:42:39,521
Let me see if I had it.

449
00:42:40,161 --> 00:42:41,121
I wrote it down.

450
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,081
I wrote it down, but then I didn't.

451
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,280
I only have the page numbers in this book.

452
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,720
That's so annoying.

453
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,961
It's around 66.

454
00:42:51,121 --> 00:42:56,641
Because it's all very important Dostoevsky and thinking here.

455
00:42:57,521 --> 00:43:02,641
And it comes out with Da when Zosima talks to Madame Holokoff about it.

456
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,641
I hope I can find it.

457
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,320
Boy, I'm not going to.

458
00:43:06,481 --> 00:43:07,280
It's 60.

459
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:07,760
Oh, good.

460
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,480
How'd you know that?

461
00:43:08,481 --> 00:43:09,761
That's terrific.

462
00:43:11,041 --> 00:43:12,161
Not in my 60s.

463
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,360
Where do you see it?

464
00:43:14,041 --> 00:43:21,801
I'm looking at what Zosima says to Madame Holokov, that she's got to contemplate she's got to confront her evil impulses.

465
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,961
And if she thinks about them enough and dwells on them enough.

466
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:27,321
What?

467
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,041
Ah, 62.

468
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:32,921
Let's yes.

469
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,200
Oh, Rob, you got it.

470
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,001
Terrific.

471
00:43:35,001 --> 00:43:35,720
I don't know.

472
00:43:36,041 --> 00:43:37,641
So let's look at it.

473
00:43:37,641 --> 00:43:48,521
Because this is what why Alyasha thinks that Dimitri is one step ahead of him, ahead of Alyasha.

474
00:43:48,521 --> 00:43:52,521
Because Alyasha isn't confronting his sensuality and his Karmatsu, you know.

475
00:43:52,681 --> 00:43:59,081
He's just worried about it, obsessing about it, sticking his fingers in his ears when anybody talks about sex.

476
00:43:59,081 --> 00:44:02,200
And that's, and Dimitri is plunging into it.

477
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:08,121
You'd think that would be worse, but that's better because he's not lying to himself or covering it up.

478
00:44:08,121 --> 00:44:24,681
On 62, Zosima is saying to Madame Holokov, who's worried about her dark side, above all, this is in the second paragraph, avoid falsehood, every kind of falsehood, especially falsehood to yourself.

479
00:44:24,681 --> 00:44:27,240
Then comes the crucial Dostoevsky talk.

480
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:35,000
What seems to you bad within you will grow purer from the very fact that you're observing it in yourself, instead of hiding from it.

481
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,521
Certainly Dimitri is observing it in himself.

482
00:44:38,521 --> 00:44:44,601
Alyasha is just sort of frightened and finding it in himself, but he doesn't want it and he doesn't want to think about it.

483
00:44:44,601 --> 00:44:46,440
And then comes the crucial thing.

484
00:44:46,441 --> 00:44:58,681
At the bottom of that long paragraph, Zosima says, I predict that just when you see with horror that in spite of all your efforts you are getting further from your goal instead of nearer, at that very moment you will reach it.

485
00:44:58,961 --> 00:45:16,801
That means that there is a way to transform these sensuous and could be destructive and disgusting and dangerous impulses into something positive which supports the spiritual.

486
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,801
And Zosima knows that.

487
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:24,801
And we will get to see that in Dmitry, in Grushenka.

488
00:45:26,161 --> 00:45:27,921
That may be the only two.

489
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:38,560
I think they're the only ones who do it, who convert what seems to be negative and bad into something positive in facing up to it.

490
00:45:38,561 --> 00:45:43,841
And that's why it's important that Dmitry is 13 steps.

491
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,841
Let's see, how does it go again?

492
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,520
That Dmitry is 13 steps higher than Alyasha.

493
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:55,921
In a funny way, you would think, you know, he's closer to salvation because he's more despairing.

494
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:03,841
But that's the way it works in any of these people who have this kind of Christian psychology.

495
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,240
Okay, now I know where I am.

496
00:46:07,121 --> 00:46:12,320
We've seen, have I just finished Alyasha or no?

497
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,521
I just put this page back here.

498
00:46:16,081 --> 00:46:16,961
Okay.

499
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:26,161
So now we just have to say the obvious, that Alyasha has got a kind of provisional, unconditional commitment.

500
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,080
That means really that it's an unconditional commitment, which he never changes.

501
00:46:32,161 --> 00:46:47,081
Zosima always become is super important in his life, but it's an unconditional commitment that he is able to internalize and be open to marrying somebody and presumably having an unconditional commitment to them.

502
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:58,601
But the important thing is that at this stage in his life, he's already got a relation to himself that comes by his relation to another.

503
00:46:58,601 --> 00:47:01,641
And that's so he's at R3 on your chart.

504
00:47:01,641 --> 00:47:03,720
Now, how does that work?

505
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,361
Well, there's plenty of talk about it.

506
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:12,441
And I will read a little bit just to convince you that it's something like a defining relation.

507
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:36,041
As soon as I find where I want to read it, well, he, at the bottom of 16, and the reason this life in the monastery struck him in this way was that he found in it at that time as he an extraordinary being, our celebrated elder Zosima, to whom he became attached with all the warm first love of his art and art.

508
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:53,480
That's a kind of unconditional commitment because he defines himself in terms of that relation to Zosima as sort of through Zosima, he's going to have his whole life gets its meaning.

509
00:47:54,441 --> 00:47:56,200
You see that on 31.

510
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,360
By the way, still nobody wants to say anything.

511
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,040
I think this is probably not.

512
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:07,161
I would despair of the fact that nobody's saying anything, except I couldn't imagine what I would be saying either if I was sitting there listening to me.

513
00:48:07,161 --> 00:48:20,441
But next time, to save me from despair, be ready to say things, because next time you're going to have to just take up your stand on whether you agree with Yvonne or not, and why you agree with him or not.

514
00:48:20,441 --> 00:48:22,840
But this isn't yet like a debate.

515
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,520
This is just a bunch of assertions.

516
00:48:24,521 --> 00:48:24,840
Yeah.

517
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,161
Oh, you have something to disagree or something good.

518
00:48:27,481 --> 00:48:28,601
No, I don't agree.

519
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:48,001
These characters, are they supposed to be identical to the intelligence towards the whole size of human beings, or human beings that are already constituted?

520
00:48:48,001 --> 00:48:48,880
Ah, oh, I see.

521
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,081
Yeah, so I'm going to answer that.

522
00:48:50,081 --> 00:48:51,521
That's a good question.

523
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,400
You're absolutely the perfect straight person.

524
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:56,961
We've got just enough time to do it.

525
00:48:56,961 --> 00:49:05,521
I mean, we've talked about the heredity part about how they got that way, but we haven't talked about the important.

526
00:49:06,161 --> 00:49:07,841
Here's a way to put your question.

527
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,720
Look at this.

528
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:21,200
People with the same background, Dimitri on the one hand and Yvonne on the other, who lived off their relatives, come out utterly different.

529
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:32,240
One of them, you know, totally independent and self-sufficient and obsessed with being impeccable, and the other one not caring about how they look and just going about their life without reflecting and so forth.

530
00:49:32,481 --> 00:49:33,920
Where did that difference come from?

531
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,200
Is it internal, somehow they're just in their DNA?

532
00:49:37,681 --> 00:49:41,601
Or if it isn't, what in their experience makes them like that?

533
00:49:41,601 --> 00:49:54,161
And how come Yvonne, who's after all the brother of Alyasha, hasn't got any of that religious saintliness from his mother that Alyasha got from his mother?

534
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:56,320
Okay, that's the right question.

535
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,080
We will go to it immediately.

536
00:49:58,081 --> 00:50:06,481
As soon as I read you one more quote, just to convince you that Zasima is what gives Alyasha the meaning of his life on 31.

537
00:50:06,641 --> 00:50:08,000
The bottom paragraph.

538
00:50:08,001 --> 00:50:08,641
He is holy.

539
00:50:08,641 --> 00:50:16,841
He carries in his heart the secret of the renewal for all, the power which will at last establish truth on earth, and so forth.

540
00:50:13,441 --> 00:50:19,240
That was the dream in Alyasha's heart.

541
00:50:19,561 --> 00:50:35,641
So he is absolutely sort of taken up with Zosima as the kind of really messenger of the good, and he wants the good, and he loves it in Zosima.

542
00:50:35,641 --> 00:50:42,441
That's all I have to say about that, except one, maybe one more thing before I switch to your question.

543
00:50:42,601 --> 00:50:44,840
Or two, I see there are still things to do.

544
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:48,440
But one is we got to go to page 112.

545
00:50:48,441 --> 00:50:49,401
I don't know why.

546
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,481
If I say so, we have to do it.

547
00:50:52,441 --> 00:50:53,641
Oh, it's just somewhere.

548
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,720
We're talking about Alyasha, remember.

549
00:50:56,601 --> 00:51:06,120
Another way to describe his religiousness is that he thinks that in the world of the spirit where he lives, everything will always turn out all right.

550
00:51:06,121 --> 00:51:08,760
He has that Tyric Guardian thing.

551
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,600
And it comes out at the bottom of 112, the bottom of the big paragraph.

552
00:51:12,601 --> 00:51:17,081
Now, Alyasha was certain that no one in the whole world ever would want to hurt him.

553
00:51:17,081 --> 00:51:19,561
And what's more, he knew that no one could hurt him.

554
00:51:19,561 --> 00:51:27,801
This was for him an axiom assumed once and for all without question, and he went his way without hesitating, relying on it.

555
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,960
I mean, that's like seeing the sword of the heavens.

556
00:51:31,481 --> 00:51:32,681
Nothing can hurt him.

557
00:51:32,681 --> 00:51:39,560
Even the death of Zosima couldn't hurt him, though it would certainly cause him to go into a shock.

558
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,760
And one more thing about Zosima.

559
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:56,121
Remember, I said that the test of how you live your life, which is the right way to live your life, is that the right way is the one that gives you joy, and the wrong way is the one that leads you to despair.

560
00:51:56,121 --> 00:52:02,400
I mean, there's no independent story about what rationality tells you or revelation tells you.

561
00:52:02,641 --> 00:52:10,161
It's, so to speak, existential psychology tells you by looking at the types of people and seeing what happens to them.

562
00:52:10,161 --> 00:52:16,641
And therefore, the truth of the Christian way is that the Christians are joyful.

563
00:52:16,641 --> 00:52:27,280
At the top of 30, we read: Alyasha, that is he, at the second line on the right, he was particularly struck by the fact that Father Zosima was not at all stern.

564
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,521
He was almost always gay.

565
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:37,281
And now, further, the same thing on 59, he's in this constant happy state, and he says so.

566
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:42,880
At the middle, on 59, about a third of the way down, Zosima says, Men are made for happiness.

567
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:48,961
Anyone who is completely happy has a right to say to himself, I'm doing God's will on earth.

568
00:52:48,961 --> 00:52:53,361
All the righteous, all the saints, all the holy martyrs were happy.

569
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:57,280
So that's the divine comedy aspect.

570
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:04,081
In the world of the spirit, if you're living the right way, you will be rewarded.

571
00:53:04,081 --> 00:53:08,081
Okay, now one more, and then I get to his issue.

572
00:53:08,081 --> 00:53:12,321
We haven't done Alyasha's existential double.

573
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,040
Who is Alyasha's existential double?

574
00:53:15,041 --> 00:53:16,161
Exactly.

575
00:53:16,561 --> 00:53:19,200
This sort of crazy, crazy kid.

576
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,240
We'll get more back to her craziness later.

577
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:28,081
But right now, all we want to just say is something to sort of notice that she's there.

578
00:53:28,081 --> 00:53:41,200
That is, that she's mentioned on 48, a daughter, 14, partially paralyzed, full of gaiety, with a gleam of mischief in her dark eyes, and so forth.

579
00:53:41,200 --> 00:54:08,681
How that cashes out, that she is really a practically insane sadomasochist person who slams the door on her finger and does wonderfully crazy Dostoevsky things and who spends her time dreaming up devils is that she's got the sensuous side like Alyasha, except that it's completely out of control on her part.

580
00:54:08,681 --> 00:54:10,121
But she's the one.

581
00:54:10,681 --> 00:54:13,561
I'd love to see how it works out in the second volume.

582
00:54:13,961 --> 00:54:15,320
He's going to marry her.

583
00:54:15,641 --> 00:54:19,161
Zosima tells him he's going to go out into the world and he's going to take a wife.

584
00:54:19,161 --> 00:54:24,601
And it's clear that it's, I forget where it's clear, but it's clear that it's going to be Lisa and that she's his double.

585
00:54:24,601 --> 00:54:31,560
And that somehow she's going to sort of get control and purify this, but not in this book.

586
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:33,240
So I don't have to say more about her.

587
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,400
So now we go on to something else.

588
00:54:36,441 --> 00:54:41,480
But I told you that Alyasha would have to return to the world, and I see I've got a quote about that one.

589
00:54:41,481 --> 00:54:43,240
So let's see if it's important.

590
00:54:44,521 --> 00:54:46,200
No, I don't think we need to think about that.

591
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,441
So we've got the four Karamatsas.

592
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:54,441
We've got the four views of the self.

593
00:54:54,441 --> 00:54:57,641
I'll just quickly run through them one more time.

594
00:54:57,641 --> 00:55:02,840
So Fedor runs away from facing the contradictions, impulses in himself.

595
00:55:03,161 --> 00:55:04,760
You know, okay, we've just seen that.

596
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:10,121
Ivan wants in despair desperately to repress the lackey side.

597
00:55:10,121 --> 00:55:13,720
Dimitri's desperately trying to get the two factors together.

598
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:21,480
And Alyasha has provisionally solved the problem by sublimating all his impulses into his love for Zosima.

599
00:55:21,481 --> 00:55:25,081
That's all we need to know about that.

600
00:55:25,081 --> 00:55:31,200
Now, I was going to talk next about Smirzhikov, but there's no reason we have to, because I like his question.

601
00:55:28,521 --> 00:55:32,961
So we're going to go to his question.

602
00:55:34,161 --> 00:55:44,560
And that is, why are these people who, in their environment and their life history, are so similar, so different?

603
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,521
And for that, we need a whole new category.

604
00:55:47,521 --> 00:56:00,001
What happens to what, how, what experiences they have, which, under the category, childhood memories, going to play a big role in the brothers Baramatsov.

605
00:56:00,001 --> 00:56:03,040
So let's start thinking about childhood memories.

606
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:04,561
We're going to skip to that.

607
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:18,401
Dostoevsky believes that the kind of person you are depends on your environment and heredity, but it's very important that it also depends on what happens to you when you're very young.

608
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,080
So Yvonne and Alyasha have the same meek mother, Sophia.

609
00:56:22,081 --> 00:56:23,841
They're terribly different.

610
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:27,921
And heredity can't explain that, and DNA can't explain that.

611
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,681
What does explain that?

612
00:56:30,001 --> 00:56:34,880
Well, I'm going to go quick over some things.

613
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,200
I just want to give you the context.

614
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:52,961
So the question is: why are Alyasha and Dimitri in the Christian dimension, even though they've got different mothers, while Yvonne is a philosopher and a Platonist, even though he's got the same mother as Alyasha?

615
00:56:52,961 --> 00:57:04,801
And that is that somehow there's got to be experiences in their childhood, Dostoevsky thinks, that influence their fundamental take on their the self.

616
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,360
It's a kind of Freudian idea, if that's any help.

617
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,760
And you probably read Freud in some course or other.

618
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,720
How many have come across Freud already?

619
00:57:13,481 --> 00:57:14,841
Not only a few.

620
00:57:13,441 --> 00:57:17,320
Well, anyway, I'll just give you a very quick thing.

621
00:57:17,481 --> 00:57:24,760
Dostoevsky, Freud thinks that childhood traumas are very important in shaping people's personality.

622
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,481
A trauma is a painful, bad event.

623
00:57:27,481 --> 00:57:30,120
And Dostoevsky has the reverse view.

624
00:57:30,121 --> 00:57:34,761
He thinks that what's really important are positive childhood memories.

625
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:41,400
Freud thinks that you have to repress these childhood traumas, and they're very hard to uncover in later years.

626
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,121
And that's what the therapist has to help you do.

627
00:57:44,121 --> 00:57:54,040
Dostoevsky thinks that since these memories that are important are positive memories, they're not things that people repress, but things that people remember frequently.

628
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:58,200
As he puts it every once in a while, they remember them all their lives.

629
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:04,601
Now, and here we go now to one of them in Alyasha.

630
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,881
Here's why Alyasha is different.

631
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:11,321
Here's why Alyasha is in a spiritual dimension.

632
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:18,681
And so here's he's saying on 17, second sentence of the first full paragraph.

633
00:58:18,681 --> 00:58:28,920
I've mentioned already that although he lost his mother in his fourth year, he remembered her all his life, her face, her caresses, as though she stood right before him.

634
00:58:29,081 --> 00:58:30,280
Remembered her all his life.

635
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:35,481
You see, not repressed the memory of her, Freud-like, but kept it in front of him, so to speak.

636
00:58:35,481 --> 00:58:46,600
And he says such memories persist from an early age, from even two years old, and stand out through a whole lifetime, like spots of light out of darkness, and so forth and so forth.

637
00:58:46,601 --> 00:58:48,921
Now comes his childhood memory.

638
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:55,081
He remembered, and it's all just absolutely amazing and fascinating what he remembers.

639
00:58:55,081 --> 00:59:01,041
He remembered one still summer evening, an open window, the slanting rays of the setting sun.

640
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:04,001
He recalled this most vividly of all.

641
00:59:04,001 --> 00:59:09,841
Nobody that I know thinking about Dostoevsky stops to think, what's going on there?

642
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,760
Now, I'm going to, you won't know for a while.

643
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,121
I can't tell you today.

644
00:59:13,121 --> 00:59:19,361
But you should ask yourself, when you continue this, you discover that all kinds of wild things are happening.

645
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:23,121
And what he's remembering is the slanting rays of the sun.

646
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,720
We'll get back to that.

647
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:47,041
But now, what's happening in a corner of the room, the holy image, before it, a lighted lamp, and on her knees before the image, his mother sobbing hysterically with cries and moans, snatching him up in both arms, squeezing him close till it hurt, and praying for him to the mother of God, holding him out in both arms to the image as though to put him under the mother's protection.

648
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:51,121
And suddenly a nurse rushes in and snatches him away from her in terror.

649
00:59:51,121 --> 00:59:52,720
That was the picture.

650
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,840
And Alyasha remembered his mother's face at that minute.

651
00:59:56,001 --> 00:59:59,200
It was frenzied and beautiful and so forth.

652
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,360
But he remembered most of all the rays of the sun.

653
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:04,001
Just put that aside, but that is really weird.

654
01:00:04,161 --> 01:00:07,441
You'll see in a minute that it's why that's important.

655
01:00:07,441 --> 01:00:12,320
The question is, what influence this memory has on his life?

656
01:00:12,641 --> 01:00:18,081
And it turns out that this memory literally guides his life.

657
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:27,441
And the first place you get it is on 27 when we're finding out why he went into the monastery.

658
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,400
So, and was a Christian and so forth.

659
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,840
But the three lines down.

660
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:39,521
Perhaps his memories of childhood brought back our monastery to which his mother may have taken him to Mass.

661
01:00:39,521 --> 01:00:47,801
Perhaps the slanting sunlight and the holy image to which his poor mother had held him up still worked upon his imagination.

662
01:00:47,800 --> 01:01:02,121
So there's something in that whole scene, the love of his mother and her dedication of him, so to speak, to the icon, to the Virgin Mary, and so forth, which made a lasting impression on him.

663
01:01:02,121 --> 01:01:12,841
And the first example there more coming up of how it made a lasting impression on him was that the slanting rays of the sun play an interesting role.

664
01:01:13,161 --> 01:01:19,240
I just tell you a hint, but somehow the slanting rays of the sun are the nearest thing you get to God in the book.

665
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:22,200
But I can't explain yet why and what that means.

666
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:30,200
But in any case, now we just have time to see the Dimitri memory.

667
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:40,841
Because Dostoevsky is doing something, which I'm going to tell you by the end of the time, special, original, important, that's going to happen through the whole book.

668
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:48,840
And it's happening already in the Alyosha case, but you don't really see what's happening until you see the Dimitri case.

669
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:56,521
So we have to jump way over to page 780, almost the end of the book, but nothing is going to be given away, I promise you.

670
01:01:56,521 --> 01:01:57,481
But here we go.

671
01:01:57,481 --> 01:02:00,041
Something really interesting happens.

672
01:02:01,001 --> 01:02:06,681
Somebody's being called in a witness about Dimitri at a trial.

673
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:17,161
And at the bottom of 780, this old German doctor says, about two-thirds of the way down, I remember him very well, a little chap, so high, left neglected by his father in the backyard.

674
01:02:17,161 --> 01:02:22,361
He ran about without boots on his feet and had his little britches hanging on one button.

675
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:27,240
And now he starts to tell the story at the bottom paragraph.

676
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:30,720
Oh, yes, I was a young, man then, I was 45.

677
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:36,081
And I asked myself, I'm skipping a little, why shouldn't I buy him a pound of, a pound of what?

678
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,921
And then there's all this craziness where he's trying to remember the name.

679
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:40,960
And finally, he does.

680
01:02:40,961 --> 01:02:41,760
Nuts.

681
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,400
Yes, nuts, he says at the top of 781.

682
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,440
And then he says, I bought him a pound of nuts.

683
01:02:47,441 --> 01:02:48,880
And now, pay attention.

684
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,761
Everything that happens is absolutely amazing.

685
01:02:52,161 --> 01:02:54,640
For no one had ever bought him a pound of nuts before.

686
01:02:54,641 --> 01:02:58,720
And I lifted my finger and I said to him, Boy, got their father.

687
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,801
He laughed and said, Got their father.

688
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:01,760
Got their son.

689
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:07,681
And he laughed and said again with a lisp, got their son, and got their Heiligegeist.

690
01:03:07,681 --> 01:03:11,681
And he laughed and said it as best he could, got their Heiligegeist.

691
01:03:11,681 --> 01:03:17,280
And I went away, and two days later I happened to be passing and he shouted to me, Uncle, got their father, got their son.

692
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,360
He'd only forgotten Got their Heiligegeist.

693
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:22,801
And I reminded him of it and felt sorry for him again.

694
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:23,840
What's going on there?

695
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:27,601
First, I was just leaving it the way it is here, but it's in German.

696
01:03:27,601 --> 01:03:30,320
Does anybody know what was just being said?

697
01:03:30,641 --> 01:03:35,521
God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, or God the Holy Spirit.

698
01:03:35,521 --> 01:03:41,281
And that's what the German doctor says as he gives him the pound of nuts.

699
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,161
What in the world is going on there?

700
01:03:44,161 --> 01:03:54,401
That pound of nuts is going to be the thing that Dimitri remembers all his life as an act of love and caring of which he had very little.

701
01:03:54,400 --> 01:04:04,240
But that was enough to get him sensitive to the loving, caring dimension, just like Alyasha was sensitive to it when being held up to the icon.

702
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:08,000
Because it turns out to be a lasting childhood memory.

703
01:04:08,001 --> 01:04:09,361
It would just go on.

704
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:11,601
Then he was taken away, and I didn't see him again.

705
01:04:11,601 --> 01:04:14,440
23 years passed, and I'm sitting, this is the doctor talking.

706
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:27,160
One morning in my study, a bald-headed old man, where there walks into the room a blooming young man who I never would have recognized, except that he held up his finger and said, laughing, got their father, got their son, and got their Heiligegeist.

707
01:04:27,161 --> 01:04:32,920
I have just arrived and have come to thank you for that pound of nuts, for no one ever brought me a pound of nuts.

708
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:35,081
You were the only one who ever did.

709
01:04:35,081 --> 01:04:35,800
Okay.

710
01:04:36,441 --> 01:04:38,601
Can you tell what's going on there?

711
01:04:38,601 --> 01:04:47,561
On what occasion do you say to child or to a baby, God the Father, God the Son, baptism.

712
01:04:47,561 --> 01:04:48,840
This is baptism.

713
01:04:48,840 --> 01:05:00,921
Dostoevsky has the peculiar thing that when he's doing anything of this sort, I'll tell you what sort it is as I go, he tells you.

714
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:02,600
So he's telling you what?

715
01:05:02,601 --> 01:05:19,240
That the German doctor baptized him, said over him the words that helped, that expressed the fact that he was entering the dimension of possible love and possible despair, the Christian dimension.

716
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:27,161
And that's now one wants to say, look back at what happened with Alyasha when his mother held him up to the icon.

717
01:05:27,161 --> 01:05:38,841
That was also the same kind of baptism, only Dostoevsky didn't hit you over the head with it using the words that are used when you baptize a baby.

718
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:41,801
And what is baptism for Dostoevsky?

719
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:48,840
Well, it's getting a saving childhood memory that puts you in the Christian religious dimension.

720
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:55,160
Now, the question is: what is he doing when he does this strange mood with baptism?

721
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,160
Well, now that's very important.

722
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:10,320
What Dostoevsky's doing is taking what looks just like some kind of magical formula where you say these special words, and lo and behold, the child somehow becomes part of the Christian community.

723
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:20,160
And the point is, Dostoevsky's telling you the psychological, existential meaning of baptism, according to him.

724
01:06:20,321 --> 01:06:27,040
I mean, baptism is just a kind of magic, and he wants to get all the magic out of Christianity.

725
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:39,601
And he wants to replace the magic with an existential account of what it does to the person's psychology to have these Christian rituals.

726
01:06:39,601 --> 01:06:43,840
And now, and we'll see what I want to say next.

727
01:06:45,441 --> 01:07:06,000
The whole book on one level is dedicated to the project of saving Christianity by converting all the magical mystery things that happen in Christianity into existential things.

728
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
He's demagicalizing it.

729
01:07:08,241 --> 01:07:12,641
The way theologians talk, he's demythologizing Christianity.

730
01:07:12,641 --> 01:07:14,000
I think that's a bad move.

731
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:20,720
The student pointed out: myths are good things, and we don't want to demythologize.

732
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,641
But magic isn't a good thing.

733
01:07:22,641 --> 01:07:23,920
And why isn't it?

734
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:37,760
Because you don't want to get yourself in the position of thinking of Christianity as some kind of causal thing, in which those magic words said over the baby transform the baby in some way.

735
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:41,601
That's, if you do that, you're in serious trouble.

736
01:07:41,601 --> 01:07:51,641
Because if you start thinking of Christianity as sort of magical ways of causing things, then you run up against the laws of physics and chemistry and neuroscience.

737
01:07:51,641 --> 01:08:01,720
Believe it or not, Dostoevsky has already just gotten news of neuroscience, and that seems to compete with these Christian magical practices.

738
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:07,000
But if there are these existential practices, then there's no conflict.

739
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:17,000
And Dostoevsky is very dedicated to this, between the laws of physics and chemistry, and we can now add genetics and evolution, and the truth of Christianity.

740
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:23,960
But that requires converting every one of the Christian symbols into an existential experience.

741
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:27,240
And you just saw baptism converted.

742
01:08:27,241 --> 01:08:32,440
And Dostoevsky has this game, which I find just wonderful, and you have to learn to play it.

743
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:42,440
He never misses a chance to tell you once and once and clearly which Christian thing he has just existentialized.

744
01:08:42,441 --> 01:08:45,960
That's why the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit gets in there.

745
01:08:46,281 --> 01:08:49,960
When you give somebody a bag of nuts, it's not the normal thing to say.

746
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:58,760
You'll see, I'll just read it now in a minute, Beatrice, that he wants to existentialize.

747
01:08:58,760 --> 01:08:59,960
I'll just give you a list.

748
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:04,200
Confession, the incarnation, and big deal things.

749
01:09:04,201 --> 01:09:11,400
Ordination of priests, the crucifixion, immortality, angels, and devils.

750
01:09:11,401 --> 01:09:13,880
All of them get existentialized.

751
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:19,320
And even, and this is the most fun in the book, if you're liking this kind of thing, miracles.

752
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:25,561
You'd think you could hardly do it with miracles, since miracles seem to be the things that go against physics and chemistry.

753
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:36,400
But he's going to save the existential meaning of miracles in a way that has nothing to do with the laws that govern the way the world works.

754
01:09:36,401 --> 01:09:41,840
And when he does, and you keep your eyes open for it, he's going to tell you that was a miracle.

755
01:09:42,481 --> 01:09:44,080
Because he's always telling you that.

756
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,040
Go ahead, Beatrice.

757
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:49,601
I understand that it's not causal, but it could work on the memory.

758
01:09:50,401 --> 01:09:51,681
Oh, well, okay, good.

759
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,040
How is it causal and not causal?

760
01:09:55,361 --> 01:09:59,601
It's not causal in the physics and chemistry and neural way.

761
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:12,400
That is, he doesn't have a theory, and he doesn't need one, and he probably doesn't think there is one, of how these existential experiences happen on the level of the way the brain works and so forth.

762
01:10:12,401 --> 01:10:16,880
He wants a description that captures the whole meaning of it.

763
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:28,400
You could say the phenomenology of it, the existential phenomenology of it, and shows that it doesn't matter how the neurons do it and how, you know, and so forth.

764
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:40,960
What's important is that this, you have to understand the meaning of how it is that holding up the baby to the icon or giving the pound of nuts can influence somebody all their lives.

765
01:10:42,241 --> 01:10:45,440
It doesn't matter whether you have a neuron story about it.

766
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:46,641
Anybody else?

767
01:10:46,641 --> 01:10:49,200
And this is one of the most exciting things in the book.

768
01:10:49,681 --> 01:10:51,840
I'm going to write a book about this someday.

769
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:57,441
When I do, I want to say Dostoevsky's attempt, he's very important.

770
01:10:57,441 --> 01:11:07,521
I mean, if you want to save Christianity in some form, you've got to one decide what form, and we'll get to that in not next lecture, but the lecture after.

771
01:11:07,521 --> 01:11:21,800
And you've got to do it in a way that physics and neuroscience and evolution, the latest, isn't going to undermine what you want to do it in a way that doesn't get you in competition with science, because that's a losing thing.

772
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:29,880
They've been losing ever since the church tried to keep Galileo's views that the earth wasn't the center of the universe a secret.

773
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:44,040
And Galileo, supposedly, after he said, after he gave into the Inquisition and said he, okay, so the earth doesn't move, then he mumbled under his breath, but it moves just the same.

774
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:48,200
I mean, science is going to win out if you get into the science business.

775
01:11:48,201 --> 01:11:50,040
So, but who cares?

776
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,561
Dostoevsky's view is.

777
01:11:51,561 --> 01:11:59,800
There is a certain understanding of humans' beings and what they need and how they get it, which the Christians have got.

778
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:04,601
And that can be preserved and had better be preserved.

779
01:12:04,601 --> 01:12:07,000
Okay, anybody have anything to say about that?

780
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:10,281
But now you see how this relates to what you asked.

781
01:12:10,281 --> 01:12:13,400
I mean, now we know why, I'm going to just sort of sum it up.

782
01:12:13,401 --> 01:12:20,360
Now we know why Alyasha is in the Christian dimension and has love at the center of everything he does.

783
01:12:20,361 --> 01:12:29,800
And Yvonne, who's got the same heredity and the same environment, but no childhood memory, isn't.

784
01:12:30,441 --> 01:12:42,361
And Dimitri, who hasn't got a religious mother, is nonetheless in the religious dimension, because it doesn't have to be your mother who baptizes you.

785
01:12:42,361 --> 01:12:44,040
In this case, it's the German doctor.

786
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:50,120
But the crucial thing is Dimitri's in the religious dimension because he's got a childhood memory.

787
01:12:50,120 --> 01:13:04,641
It follows from this that if you wanted to make everybody that you were in touch with religion, religious and Christian, you'd have to go about the job of creating the appropriate childhood memory.

788
01:12:58,521 --> 01:13:07,200
And indeed, I won't tell you more.

789
01:13:07,201 --> 01:13:08,800
That's going to turn out to be important.

790
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,360
Yeah.

791
01:13:09,681 --> 01:13:10,880
We talk real loud.

792
01:13:11,361 --> 01:13:12,880
I can't hear you.

793
01:13:17,281 --> 01:13:18,000
It's funny.

794
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,641
Your voice is on a wavelength I can't hear.

795
01:13:20,641 --> 01:13:22,880
Either you're going to have to shout or somebody's going to repeat.

796
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:25,760
Somebody repeat in a voice I can hear what you just said.

797
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:30,960
Is he trying to convert faith or symbols?

798
01:13:31,361 --> 01:13:35,920
Angels and demons, trying to give it a different way of looking at it.

799
01:13:36,561 --> 01:13:52,240
He's trying to capture the truth about human experience, which faith has got, but which is covered up by lots of sort of magical stuff.

800
01:13:52,241 --> 01:13:56,080
And in actually faith, I should have put that on my list.

801
01:13:56,080 --> 01:14:06,160
Christian, actual faith in God gets demagicalized explicitly at the very middle of the book.

802
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:07,521
I'm going to add it to the list.

803
01:14:07,521 --> 01:14:14,080
Yes, faith has to be transformed, that is, explained like all the rest.

804
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:14,481
Okay.
