1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,479
The plan for today is to discuss what I sort of said very quickly at the end last time, but I wanted you to have it in mind when you were reading the preamble from the heart.

2
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:25,359
And that was, what's the basic experience that Kierkegaard has that he claims is this revelation of something absolutely important about human beings.

3
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,279
I'm passing out, by the way.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,280
This is old stuff.

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:42,799
But I said I would write up the difference between the Judaic Christian understanding of everything important for us and the Greek understanding.

6
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,599
Just sort of file it away as something to remind you of the first lecture.

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,919
Now, back to the basic experience.

8
00:00:51,880 --> 00:01:00,519
I said last time, but I want to say it again, what's the new experience that was around for a while, though not forever.

9
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,440
It was around since Dante loved Beatrice.

10
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,559
That is around since there were knights and ladies.

11
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:20,999
That's why you hear about knights of resignation and knights of faith, because all of this experience was sort of focused and dramatized and lived in the chivalric way.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:40,280
But it's the same as our experience of romantic love, and it really goes back to the not probably to the Hebrew experience, but to the Christian experience of the total commitment that the disciples had for Jesus, and that they gave them a new identity.

13
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,679
He went around giving them all new names.

14
00:01:42,679 --> 00:01:46,280
So Saul becomes Paul and so forth.

15
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:52,519
And they were all ready to die for this commitment they had.

16
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,919
And that's unique.

17
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:00,039
I mean, that's, from Kierkegaard's point of view, and I think I like it, I think it sounds right.

18
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:11,960
The big discovery, the big new thing that the Judeo-Christian tradition finally produced was the idea was, you could say the idea of the God-man.

19
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,919
You could say something like a Savior.

20
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:38,079
That is some, but the important thing for Kierkegaard and for the chivalric people was the important kind of relationship that the disciples had for Jesus, that they made him the central thing in their life, that when they got related to him, they got a new identity, they got a new world, and they had a whole new kind of experience.

21
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:52,559
And the Judeo-Christian religion is the only religion that's got that, that makes what I'm calling unconditional commitment absolutely important for what it is to be a fulfilled human being.

22
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,720
In Kierkegaard jargon, what it means not to get out of despair.

23
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,999
We'll talk about that way of describing it later.

24
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:21,199
And in its romantic love version, where it comes down to Kierkegaard and Regina, it's still the same important and unique idea of what's important, what's the most important, exciting, meaningful possibility for human beings.

25
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:27,359
So, in Kierkegaard, it sounds so trivial, but it's not trivial.

26
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:35,840
I mean, it's whether it's, they are all about some kind of commitment that makes, that changes your life completely.

27
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:54,559
And it could be something as sort of, what, I don't know, literary or something as the bottom of page 70, where a young lad falls in love with the princess and the whole content of his life is in this love.

28
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:03,119
The crucial thing is this whole content of your life being bound up in some commitment.

29
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:20,840
And remember, it says on 71, these are all things we said at the end, I said in the end in a hurry, that, of course, this is the footnote, any other interest whatsoever in which an individual concentrates the whole of life's reality can, and then he goes on to talk about resignation, that I'm not ready to talk about that.

30
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:31,640
But the main thing is he generalizes it to any commitment which gives your life its whole meaning, gives you an identity.

31
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,880
Dante is the lover of Beatrice.

32
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:41,560
The disciples are the disciples of Jesus, and the knight is the knight for this lady, and that's their job description.

33
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:43,160
That's who they are.

34
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,919
That's what defines them.

35
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,720
And then, and now that's about how far I got last time, because I jumped ahead.

36
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:19,080
If I had done it in the normal order I usually want to do it in, we have to go back a little and see that Kierkegaard was looking for this ever since he was 22, that is about your age, writing in his journals what he was later going to sort of try to live out with Rodino, although it didn't work, and what the lad has for the princess or the knight for the lady.

37
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:34,679
Here's what he wrote in when he was 22 in his journal: What I really lack is to be clear in my mind, underlined now, what I am to do, not what I am to know, except insofar as a certain understanding must precede action.

38
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:38,520
Well, that's the Greek-Hebrew thing in a nutshell.

39
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:43,400
That is, what's important is what he does, not what he knows.

40
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:50,919
And of course, you have to know something in order to act, but he's looking for this defining action in his life.

41
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:59,239
So the next thing he says, the thing is to understand myself, to see what God really wishes me, underlined, to do.

42
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:01,640
That is, he's looking for his calling.

43
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,559
He's looking for his vocation.

44
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:14,799
He's looking for what, that is something that grabs him and makes him into the kind of person he becomes and will be the rest of his life.

45
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:15,679
So let me finish.

46
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:18,559
I'm looking for what God wishes me to do.

47
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:22,080
The thing is to find a truth that is true for me.

48
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:38,319
You recognize the Hebrew kind of truth, not a knowledge kind of truth, not something that you objectively, theoretically know that corresponds to reality, but what Kierkegaard is going to call a subjective truth.

49
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,720
That is, the truth for him.

50
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,119
That, whatever it is, let's stick to Beatrice, but if we don't, Kierkegaard's life is so messed up.

51
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:51,359
So that Dante knows that he's the lover of Beatrice.

52
00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:53,199
That's his truth.

53
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:59,359
And Kierkegaard says, then, the final bit of the quote: to find the idea for which I can live and die.

54
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:00,800
That's a little bit wrong.

55
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,999
He's young and he's just getting used to it.

56
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:05,840
It's not an idea.

57
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:17,200
It's a positive person, something or somebody, finite and temporal, to talk Kierkegaard kind of jargon.

58
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,799
It could be a person.

59
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:34,479
It could be a cause, like, as I said last time, I think I said it, Martin Luther King feeling that he's defined by being the leader and organizer of what's going to get justice for the black people here and now.

60
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,520
It's not enough that it be a good idea.

61
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,760
It's got to be something specific.

62
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:52,440
And the crucial way to think about it is: whatever this something is that is the truth for you, it's got to be something that you know, it tells you what to do now in the world.

63
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:59,240
Every morning when you wake up, there is something important for you to do, and lots of other things are just trivial and irrelevant.

64
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:13,800
And if all you're dedicated to is some very general something or other, like the ultimate triumph of the proletariat, and then if you could stay in bed on a rainy day, it doesn't matter because the proletariat will win out someday anyway.

65
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:29,560
And it's not a truth that is concrete and finite and temporal enough to tell you what you are to do, as Kierkegaard says, all the time.

66
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:35,320
So, okay, now that, and that's what I'm calling unconditional commitment.

67
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:40,280
You know, a theologian named Paul Tillich called it ultimate concern.

68
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:48,520
Kierkegaard calls it infinite passion, which is a little bit unfortunate because it makes it sound like you're all excited by it all the time.

69
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:54,600
And you have this kind of commitment even when you're half asleep in the morning drinking your coffee or washing the dishes.

70
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,479
It doesn't something that you're always all excited about.

71
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:59,080
It's more basic than that.

72
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:07,720
It's something that sort of structures your world so that what shows up for you is important to do is there all the time.

73
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,720
Whether you're sort of excited by it doesn't matter.

74
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,999
You're defined by it.

75
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:15,640
That's much more fundamental.

76
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:21,800
So it's not a strong feeling, as he says on 71.

77
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,479
That's where he wants to make sure it's not intoxication, it says here.

78
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:30,680
That would be all right.

79
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,680
Intoxication is probably, I thought, the right word, certainly not getting drunk.

80
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:40,320
But the same word that means getting drunk in English is like intoxication.

81
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:45,280
Only intoxication is supposed to be this sort of emotional thing.

82
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,000
It doesn't have to come from drinking alcohol.

83
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:54,640
And that's what he, and that's why an infatuation is also an intoxication in this broad way.

84
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:59,600
And he wants to make sure that this is the content of his life, it says on 71.

85
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:07,519
And that means not just a kind of temporary overwhelming feeling.

86
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:14,000
That is, his soul is too healthy and proud to squander the least thing on intoxication.

87
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,320
And then what happens?

88
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:24,640
Well, for one thing, let me say a word about something important.

89
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,879
That I have to say it somewhere.

90
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:39,120
That Kierkegaard is the only one of the existentialists who thinks that philosophy, the Greek way of thinking about things, is important and even necessary and valuable.

91
00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:52,560
Pascal thinks that Descartes is just somebody wasting their time in a warm room trying to prove theorems and geometry, and that's just a way of avoiding facing the wretchedness of the human condition.

92
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,159
But there is something for theory and rationalness.

93
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:10,960
And it's just exactly to get rid of these strong irrational feelings, these intoxications, so that you can have a real commitment.

94
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,400
So, in that sense, the Greek philosophers were right.

95
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:30,600
In Kierkegaard language, you have to get over your infatuations, your moods, your superstitions, your passions, all of that is something that he calls, and I'll explain this in a minute, lower immediacy.

96
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,160
And it needs to be mediated.

97
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:36,200
Now, that's two bits of Hegel jargon.

98
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:56,680
One thing I didn't say last time, which needs to be said at some point, is if this book isn't hard enough because it's so original and because it's a secret code for Regina and because it's trying to say something in thinkable terms, which is in principle unthinkable, namely the Christian story.

99
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,759
He doesn't want to just put it into Greek terms.

100
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,280
He knows that isn't going to work.

101
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:03,800
So the book is bad or hard already.

102
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:10,680
And he does it using the Hegel jargon, which is some whole thing that I haven't got time to teach you.

103
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,999
I'll give you a chart next time in which you can, I'll sort of lay out the Hegel jargon.

104
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:24,919
But I'll just tell you enough of it right now so that you know, you've got to know immediacy, lower immediacy, higher immediacy, and mediation.

105
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,920
So these are super important terms for Kierkegaard.

106
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:33,320
So at the bottom is what he calls lower immediacy.

107
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:40,120
Now, lower immediacy is what we have with the animal, like animals, like children.

108
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:48,040
It's just sort of where we start in our lives and in our experience.

109
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:57,479
Immediacy is, I don't know exactly, I'm trying to give you a feel for why he would call it immediacy.

110
00:12:57,479 --> 00:12:59,880
And I haven't got a very good one.

111
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,120
The best I could do is immediacy is where you start right off.

112
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,880
What's spontaneous, what hits you right now without reflection.

113
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,520
It's supposed to cover feelings, impulses, stuff like that.

114
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,280
Babies have them, and cats certainly have them.

115
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,320
Feelings, impulses, and so forth.

116
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:31,120
And he wants to say that the philosophers were right, Plato and Socrates and so forth.

117
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:43,680
We have to get, outgrow, get over that kind of lower immediacy, which is a kind of getting what you want right away.

118
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:47,680
What if there's a word for that, that children have that, that they have?

119
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:48,880
What?

120
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,639
I forget.

121
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,759
Well, gratification, immediate gratification.

122
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:56,239
Good.

123
00:13:56,239 --> 00:13:59,520
Yes, it's the immediate gratification.

124
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:02,239
That's how immediacy comes in here.

125
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,239
They talk about immediate gratification.

126
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,840
I wanted to make the word, I have to write that in my notes for next time.

127
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:15,360
You see, that's why I need people here to tell me things that I wish I knew.

128
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:16,799
Why is it called immediate?

129
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,239
Well, temporally it's immediate.

130
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:19,440
They want it right away.

131
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:27,520
But then Hegel generalizes it into just the any time, the impulse to have it.

132
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,800
But that sort of immediate gratification is good.

133
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:36,239
Okay, now mediation is even harder to give you a feeling for why that word.

134
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:44,399
What Hegel has in mind with mediation is obviously got to do with doing something.

135
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,479
Did I misspell immediate?

136
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:48,160
Does it have two M's?

137
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,040
I think it needs a few more things like that.

138
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,600
And next is mediation.

139
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,880
Okay, so up here is mediation.

140
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:01,320
Mediation gets you out of immediacy.

141
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,560
So what is that?

142
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:04,600
What is that?

143
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,239
How do you get a feel for that?

144
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:18,120
Well, I finally thought last time I thought this of the only place I can think of where mediation in English means this thing.

145
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:21,080
It's like being what mediators do.

146
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:27,800
What mediators do is sort of calm down the labor department, the labor union, and calm down the management.

147
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:44,440
Both of them are all excited and trying to get what they want and get them to spell out explicitly what they want and then sort of settle on what they need and manage to make, by being philosophical, they can get together.

148
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,640
That's only a special case, but it's there.

149
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,720
But anyway, labor mediation is my model for this.

150
00:15:51,720 --> 00:16:11,639
It means to reflect, explain, understand what you really need, not what you want, and not trying to get what you desire right off and not getting all worked up if you don't get it, but instead being reasonable, articulate, realistic, and so forth.

151
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:12,760
That's mediation.

152
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,519
Everybody ought to go through that.

153
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:17,559
If you don't, you just remain childish.

154
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,239
And now I'm back to my point.

155
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,280
Kierkegaard is the only one who sees that the philosophers have got that.

156
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:29,560
They've understood that lower immediacy is not a good thing to have, and you can do better.

157
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:37,039
And they've understood that being theoretical, rational, reflective, and so forth gets you out of lower immediacy.

158
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:47,760
You can get over your superstitions and you can get over your tradition and what your family thinks you ought to do just because that's what people have always done it.

159
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:54,239
You can get out of all that if you learn to think reasonably, like we try to teach in the philosophy department.

160
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,240
And Kierkegaard thinks that's a good thing.

161
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:06,240
He doesn't think it's sort of bad news, like Pascal thinks Descartes is sort of making a terrible mistake in spending his time this way.

162
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,999
He calls it diversion instead of relating to God.

163
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,639
And you'll see, Dostoevsky thinks that philosophers are bad guys, all of them, sick.

164
00:17:18,879 --> 00:17:22,080
And Nietzsche certainly thinks literally that philosophers are sick.

165
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:32,959
We'll read the part where he talks about Socrates as a great degenerate who has done all kinds of bad things to undermine Athenian culture.

166
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,560
But that's unfortunate, I think.

167
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:41,679
I mean, the existentials see only the bad side of mediation.

168
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:48,800
See that if you stopped with mediation, you would indeed miss what's most important for human beings.

169
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,279
But they don't see the good side of mediation.

170
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,039
That if you don't have it, you just couldn't tell if any, there wouldn't be anything.

171
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,039
There is something higher than lower immediacy.

172
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,000
And mediation is one step toward it.

173
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,439
And so far, this is straight Hegel.

174
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,439
The terms and the idea is Hegel.

175
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:17,280
But then comes Kierkegaard, and he says this weird thing that there is a higher immediacy.

176
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,039
And the higher immediacy, this is Kierkegaard's idea.

177
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,560
Well, you know what higher immediacy is already.

178
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,759
Higher immediacy is unconditional commitment.

179
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:38,199
It's not just subjective, infantile impulses for immediate gratification.

180
00:18:38,199 --> 00:18:41,320
That's gotten rid of by mediation.

181
00:18:41,320 --> 00:19:00,039
But mediation would just give you, make you into a theoretical, detached, universal member, a rational being that did what every rational being does and all these things that the Greeks thought were good and which are good as a step.

182
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,959
But you don't want to end up there.

183
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:07,959
You want to end up as, and now comes his crucial term, higher immediacy makes you an individual.

184
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:28,439
To be an individual is just another name for being defined, having a concrete content, a defining content, a whole content in your life, which defines you as the lover of Beatrice or whatever, or the lover of Regina or the leader of the black people.

185
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:30,519
Those are all individuals.

186
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:38,439
Kierkegaard said that he wanted carved on his tombstone: here lies an individual.

187
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:48,039
He thought it was the most important, the most meaningful, the most rewarding thing you could do is get a commitment that made you an individual, and that it was very hard.

188
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,679
And there are very few people who are individuals.

189
00:19:50,679 --> 00:20:02,359
Most of them just do what a normal American or intellectual or whatever are members of some general class or other.

190
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:08,320
Now there's another important thing, not to be written over here, but maybe over here.

191
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:11,199
This is individual is not the same as particular.

192
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,959
And now becomes another unfortunate reason why this book is so hard.

193
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:20,959
Because there seems to be only one word in Danish.

194
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:27,840
I can't believe this, but I've asked every time I find anybody here in natural language Danish?

195
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:34,399
But there's some word like Enkele, which apparently doesn't make a distinction between particular and individual.

196
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,400
And you don't normally do it either.

197
00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:39,920
I mean, it's built into English, but you don't know it because we don't need it.

198
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,279
I mean, we don't talk about this very often.

199
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:50,000
But a particular is just an instant, a particular example, we say.

200
00:20:50,320 --> 00:21:08,239
So, for instance, if you buried your dog, you could write on the tombstone, here lies a particular, it would be silly to do it, but you can't write on the tombstone of your dog, here lies an individual, because an individual has got this thing of having a unique defining commitment.

201
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,840
So everybody is always a particular.

202
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,279
That's not a big deal.

203
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,600
You can't help but be a particular.

204
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,719
That is just an instance of something, one example.

205
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,600
And I'll have to keep pointing out to you, this is what makes it so annoying and hard.

206
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,399
The translator, who always seems, doesn't understand the book.

207
00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:35,919
I mean, it isn't as hard to find a version better than Alistair Hanney's.

208
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:45,359
But when Kierkegaard is throwing around this term Enkela, if you don't understand the context, you can't tell whether he means particular or individual.

209
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:47,119
It's the same Danish word.

210
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:52,040
But if he doesn't even notice it's a problem, I think, because for him, he understands the context.

211
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:59,640
He knows whether he's talking about whether it's something that everybody has down here, that they're a particular.

212
00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:01,080
We can put that here.

213
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,959
And I'll tell you when it happens so that you, in crucial passages, won't get confused.

214
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:13,560
And pretty soon, hopefully, you'll get so that you can tell, even if the translator can't, which Kierkegaard's doing.

215
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,039
So up here, you've become an individual.

216
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,800
Down here, you're a particular.

217
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,159
Anybody want to say anything?

218
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:21,719
I feel I've been talking a lot.

219
00:22:21,879 --> 00:22:24,039
Somebody must be thinking something.

220
00:22:25,639 --> 00:22:26,279
Yeah.

221
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,400
Aha.

222
00:22:27,399 --> 00:22:29,159
A terrific question.

223
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:30,760
I know the answer.

224
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,320
It's not a hard, I mean, but it's the right question to ask.

225
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,800
And now I have to see how to formulate the answer.

226
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,679
They both aren't mediated.

227
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:46,600
They both have both ways of making an exception of yourself.

228
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:54,440
I mean, in a way that the child makes an exception of himself is he just doesn't care whether anybody else gets the ice cream at the birthday party.

229
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,279
If he could get it all, he would.

230
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,520
And in general, I can put it in ethical terms.

231
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,279
Down here, people are just like animals and children making exceptions of themselves all the time.

232
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:12,039
Here, people are doing the universal, that's another Kierkegaard term for this.

233
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,439
They're doing what every good, they should be doing what every good rational person should be doing.

234
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:23,000
Up here, they're making an exception of themselves again, but in a different sense.

235
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,119
That's the answer.

236
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:30,199
They're making an exception because there's only one lover, Beatrice, and other people can love other people.

237
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:39,679
But when you have a defining commitment, then you aren't in the universal anymore.

238
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:53,279
I mean, what we'll talk about next time, okay, in just a second, is the dramatic way that Abraham is not in the universal because his particular commitment, well, it's his is so weird that it takes a lot of explaining.

239
00:23:53,280 --> 00:24:06,159
But one thing is sure, if you have a commitment that requires you to kill your son, you look like you're down here in the level of the crazies.

240
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:19,359
But if you have it as part of your unconditional, if it's your unconditional commitment who defines who you are, and we'll go into that a lot later, not yet, then you are an exception.

241
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,439
Or sometimes he says the exception.

242
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:26,320
So being an individual is also called being an exception.

243
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,080
That goes down with this universal down here.

244
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:40,480
And that's got to do with problem one and problem two, which you haven't read yet, one thing at a time, which has to do with how the person relates to the universal.

245
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,320
But that's what's really at stake.

246
00:24:42,320 --> 00:25:02,959
The immediacy wipes out this kind of everyone for himself lower immediacy, but it gives them, it gives you that when you become an individual, you're beyond the universal, you're unique, and so forth.

247
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,239
Does that help?

248
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,720
Good.

249
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:05,520
It's a good question.

250
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,720
I think that's a good answer.

251
00:25:06,719 --> 00:25:08,000
So we can go on.

252
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,119
Back there, yeah.

253
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:10,480
Why would you say that?

254
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,519
I mean, it seems to me both of them could be higher immediacy.

255
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,800
Both of them could be giving you the whole content of your life.

256
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,600
Ah, ah, ah, I see, I see.

257
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,519
Hmm.

258
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,800
Interesting.

259
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,239
You want to say something about that?

260
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:37,959
Well, somebody knows that well, not exactly, but I can see sort of.

261
00:25:37,959 --> 00:25:50,359
I mean, everybody's going to have their own unique way of having their infinite passion or their unconditional commitment for Jesus or for Beatrice.

262
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,800
Let's just stick to that.

263
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:59,959
I mean, if Dante loves Beatrice, and so does somebody else love Beatrice, that doesn't mean that it's sort of an accident.

264
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:03,639
I mean, it could have been one person, it could have been a group.

265
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:13,879
Now, if they get together, which is his point, like the Christian community and all follow Jesus, that's a problem for Kierkegaard in a way.

266
00:26:13,879 --> 00:26:17,080
I mean, Kierkegaard is a radical Protestant.

267
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,000
He does, I mean, he's a Lutheran.

268
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:29,239
But anyway, he doesn't think there's any place for community, for everybody, in some sense, getting anything positive out of doing the same thing as everybody else.

269
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,560
Every Christian is in complete isolation.

270
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:40,840
He says, I'll read it to you when we get to Dostoevsky, because Dostoevsky is interested in this, what he considers crazy version of Protestantism.

271
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:50,519
But so I'm just curious, are you religious in some religion?

272
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,639
You you?

273
00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:52,280
Yeah.

274
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,320
Ah, good.

275
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,359
That's just what I want.

276
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,439
That's what I wanted to hear.

277
00:26:56,439 --> 00:27:04,199
And the Catholics have certainly got the sense of the absolutely essential character of community in religion.

278
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:13,280
And there's just a new book out by Charles Taylor, which is making a big splash, 800 pages of it, make a very big splash, called The Secular Age.

279
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:20,800
Taylor is the most intelligent religious Catholic writer.

280
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,440
And he's got certainly the importance of community.

281
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,280
He wrote a book about William James about two years ago.

282
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:36,959
And James has lots of interesting things to say about religious experience in the varieties of religious experience, which is the name of his book.

283
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:48,480
But what he doesn't have is any sense that religious experience is communal, which you do with Catholics like Charles Taylor does, but Tierkegaard doesn't.

284
00:27:48,480 --> 00:28:06,959
Kierkegaard thinks that being an individual is just something that is your way of being an individual, even your way of loving Jesus, if that was what the issue was, is so special and so unique that there's nothing you can share about it.

285
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,320
If you did, you'd be mediating it.

286
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,999
I mean, from a Kierkegaard point of view, the church is a disaster because it's mediating things.

287
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,679
I might as well say that right now.

288
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:36,159
Kierkegaard thinks that the Lutheran church, which isn't Catholic but is the state church of Denmark in his time, and maybe I think even in our time, is undermining just this kind of isolation of the true committed person.

289
00:28:36,639 --> 00:28:47,840
His last book was called Attack on Christendom, in which he claimed that the church as a community was an obstacle to being able to lead a Christian life.

290
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,959
You really raised a can of worms in a way there.

291
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:54,919
But that's how it is with Kierkegaard.

292
00:28:54,919 --> 00:29:10,039
And he certainly got some very important insight about being an individual, but he's lost something important because he can't understand any sense of community except mediation, where everybody gets together and believes the same thing.

293
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,239
And he thinks that's certainly not the highest thing.

294
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:20,920
So we'll get back to that when we read the Grand Inquisitor story in the Brothers Karamatsov.

295
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,439
But for the time being, I just, you're right to put that issue on the table.

296
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:27,959
Anybody else?

297
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:28,760
Okay, yeah.

298
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,840
Well, yes and no.

299
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,000
I mean, it just isn't individuality.

300
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:48,519
It's having this very special kind of uniqueness that gives you your defining commitment.

301
00:29:48,520 --> 00:30:07,639
And the idea that he should be open to other religions, which is what you're sort of saying, that if he thinks that everybody should do their own thing, so to speak, why shouldn't they do a Buddhist thing or a whatever, Hindu thing or something like that?

302
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,800
That's not it.

303
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:17,320
He definitely thinks that Judeo-Christian understanding of what it is to be a self is right.

304
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:33,519
And that kind of being an individual is, if a religion denies that kind of being an individual and tries to sort of find in everybody some common thing, which is the important thing, then they're in the philosophical tradition.

305
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:50,879
And he isn't saying, well, they should do their individual thing, say, be Platonists, because if your individual thing is believing in any kind of universal human nature, then it's not the kind of individual thing Kierkegaard means.

306
00:30:50,879 --> 00:31:00,560
And so, but your point is, in a way, it turns into a kind of, I don't think, intolerance is right.

307
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:08,479
I mean, Kierkegaard's more intolerant of the Lutheran Church than he is of the Buddhist, because it's the Lutheran Church which is in his way.

308
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:19,919
But it turns into a belief that once you understand what it is to be a human being, and I can't talk about this yet, but I mean, there are two possibilities.

309
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:31,519
The Kierkegaard thinks that once you understand what it is to be a human being in the West, where you were born and raised, if you are, then you will be in despair if you don't have a defining commitment.

310
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:38,320
But I think Kierkegaard thinks that if you're a Buddhist and raised in that tradition, you've got a different nature.

311
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,159
Remember, custom is our nature.

312
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,519
And you won't be in despair for being a Buddhist.

313
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:53,999
However, it's a higher kind of non-despair to be a Christian, I think he thinks, than any other, harder and better than any other religion.

314
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,240
And that's, you're looking worried.

315
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,959
I mean, that's how he thinks about it, I believe.

316
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,199
And remember, you don't have to believe everything Kierkegaard says.

317
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:05,039
You can do what I'm trying to do.

318
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:17,759
There's some very original and very deep insights that you could only have if you were in the Judeo-Christian tradition and if you were in there after the chivalric people and so forth.

319
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,359
And then there are things you don't, Kierkegaard doesn't get.

320
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:29,719
I mean, that's like community, and that's like that the other religions might be just as rewarding as the Christian, Judeo-Christian.

321
00:32:29,719 --> 00:32:34,759
Okay, those are all the right, you're in the big ballpark of the right issues.

322
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,080
Yeah.

323
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,439
Doesn't that make you narrow-minded?

324
00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:42,119
Yeah, I think it does.

325
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:53,080
I think it makes you, I think Kierkegaard thinks that being narrow-minded in the sense of having your own unique calling is a good thing to do, to be.

326
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:56,359
It only sort of sounds bad if you make it narrow-minded.

327
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:17,319
If you think that the universal is the highest thing and important, and that sort of the shared truth that you could get by detachment and theory and so forth, or even by other religious practices like meditation or something, if you think that's the highest, then it looks narrow-minded.

328
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:28,119
But if you think that this, the higher immediacy satisfies more of what human beings, at least in the West, really need, then it doesn't look narrow-minded.

329
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,919
It looks deep, that's all.

330
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,719
So obviously, it's the same point as his.

331
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:40,280
I mean, it's definitely not meant to be for everybody.

332
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:43,959
But remember, the Judeo-Christian tradition wasn't really meant to be for everybody.

333
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,199
It was a covenant with God for the Hebrews.

334
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:55,800
It got messed up by the Greeks when they thought that the Ten Commandments were for every, when later they thought the Ten Commandments were for everybody, as I understand it.

335
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:03,719
And I'm not sure I'm right, but anyway, I like to think that when God gave the Ten Commandments to the Hebrews, they were for the Hebrews.

336
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:36,400
I mean he didn't say to everybody that you should have no other God before me he just said it to them and it's it's not I've lost my train of thought what am I trying to say here Oh, just that this way of understanding what human beings are and what human beings need is what the kind of human beings that we are, given insofar as I'm talking now to Judeo-Christians in the West, insofar as custom is our nature, this is what human beings need.

337
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:50,560
And it's just part of the whole way of, the whole really different Judeo-Christian way of looking at things is to say, well, there isn't any human nature and any big universal story about what all human beings need.

338
00:34:50,560 --> 00:35:00,400
Different human beings raised in different cultures have different gods, and we're talking about the one that got raised in this culture with this God.

339
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,199
That's part of the existentialism thing.

340
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:13,759
If you don't buy that, you're into something else, namely, you're into not the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to talk like Pascal.

341
00:35:13,759 --> 00:35:15,760
You're into the God of the philosophers.

342
00:35:15,759 --> 00:35:18,000
And that's just a different ballgame.

343
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:26,559
And that's the one you learn from all your other courses here, to be rational, critical, theoretical, universal, detached, and so forth.

344
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:33,279
And that's why a course like this is very important to tell you that part of your tradition is something entirely different.

345
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:37,439
Okay, I think that's one last question, then I've got to go on.

346
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:37,920
Okay.

347
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,240
Dependent on what?

348
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,919
Ah, wow.

349
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:45,840
I think this is amazing.

350
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:50,279
Every one of the hardest, deepest issues has come out in this discussion.

351
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:57,719
Another, you guys have got, I mean, I think it's partly because I make Kierkegaard's position so clear, I take some credit.

352
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:02,840
But you guys have seen you all, you've seen every limitation in it.

353
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:08,040
And this one is that he doesn't have any notion of reciprocity at all, of what the other person cares about.

354
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,279
You.

355
00:36:08,279 --> 00:36:13,319
He sat on his terrace of his cafe and had a defining commitment for Regina.

356
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:19,159
And it just doesn't matter to him, really, whether Regina has a defining commitment to him or not.

357
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:30,199
He sort of assumes, of course, she has, after all, he's a brilliant young man, rich and in the university and about, I think, maybe 10 years older than she and so forth.

358
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,079
But it never occurs to him that it matters.

359
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,359
And that's bad.

360
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:43,159
I mean, certainly somehow you have to get into this story relations to other people at the level of higher immediacy.

361
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:46,440
Dostoevsky tries to do it, and maybe he does do it.

362
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,759
Anyway, it's not that Kierkegaard couldn't do it.

363
00:36:48,759 --> 00:36:50,119
Nobody can do everything.

364
00:36:50,119 --> 00:37:01,479
And you're seeing the limits of what is nonetheless a very, very worked out and brilliant and deep position.

365
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:07,399
So let's go back to the one that we've got, because there's certain stuff I have to cover before the first movie.

366
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,200
Otherwise, I think things will be in bad shape.

367
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,919
The movie isn't next time, thank goodness, but it's next Tuesday.

368
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,799
But I've got to get enough done today, but Thursday I could do the rest.

369
00:37:17,799 --> 00:37:19,480
So let's see where we are.

370
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:24,920
So, this commitment is something worth living for.

371
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,080
It's also worth dying for.

372
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:43,839
Malrau, a famous philosopher, said that if nothing is worth living for that isn't worth dying for, and Kierkegaard really believes that, and that leads to martyrs, the old Christian martyrs, but also Martin Luther King.

373
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:54,960
I wondered if anybody has, if anybody has the DVD of his last sermon before he died, I'd love to have it because he's got all of this in there.

374
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,000
He says, I think, if I remember, I don't think of me as the man who won the Nobel Prize.

375
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:10,560
Don't think of me, and there's a whole lot of things that might have defined him, but think of me as the one who led my people out of their misery into a world of justice.

376
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,799
And then he says that he's ready to die for that.

377
00:38:14,799 --> 00:38:26,800
I remember he said it's nice to live along and have a rich old age, but I've been on the mountain, I've seen what I have to do, and I've done it, and that's so I can die tomorrow would be all right.

378
00:38:26,799 --> 00:38:29,600
That's pure Kierkegaardian thinking.

379
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,000
Yeah, I'd love to have it.

380
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:41,280
And then I'll copy it and listen and see, because I want to see the places where I think he lists all the other possible definitions of him that aren't really his defining commitment.

381
00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:43,200
Okay, let me go on here.

382
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:53,119
So the difference I've written down here, when JFK says we're going to the moon, or Bush says we're going to walk on Mars, that's interesting.

383
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:57,200
And that's a kind of commitment, but it's not a defining commitment.

384
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:20,520
Unlike with Martin Luther King, if his life is meaningless and he's in grief, if they fail to get the peace marches and fail to, if the northern whites don't show up because they're frightened by the fact that they're being killed in the peace marches, then if what he stands toward is gone, he's just lost like somebody who's loved one has died.

385
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:33,080
But of course, if it's just something else you're committed to, not an unconditional commitment, well, if JFK doesn't get to the moon, then he won't experience grief, he'll just be sorry.

386
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,400
And the same with the Mars thing.

387
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:48,440
We're talking about something that somebody is ready to die for, and if it fails them, then if they fail at it, then their life is lost, and the point of their life is gone.

388
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,600
Now, that's going to get us, but we've got to go through a lot to get there yet.

389
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:58,439
The big question, which I still have to get into, at the end last time, no, it's too early.

390
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,039
Sorry, I'm not going to say that now.

391
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,040
I'm going to get there soon enough.

392
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:13,800
Let's get back to the defining commitment because I'm still sort of telling you all about the sort of phenomenological structure, that is the description of what it's like experientially.

393
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:25,560
And now, the next thing to say is about it that in the middle of 72, you can't forget the whole thing, of course, and remain the same person.

394
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,119
The knight makes the movement, but what movement?

395
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:30,839
Well, movement, remember, is a way of acting.

396
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,400
Commitment is the one we're talking about.

397
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,479
Does he want to forget the whole thing?

398
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,880
Because in that, too, there's a kind of concentration.

399
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:47,000
No, for the knight doesn't contradict himself, and it's a contradiction to forget the whole of one's life content and still be the same.

400
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:58,440
So that is the you can't you can sort of refuse this love, this calling.

401
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:03,399
But if once you've got the calling and it defines you, you can't just drop it.

402
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,239
You can't say, well, this person is crazier than I realize.

403
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:08,960
I just not going to stick with this anymore.

404
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,839
And so forth.

405
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:14,080
Once you're in it and it defines you, you can't drop it.

406
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:19,520
Otherwise, you will be, as he says, only lower natures forget themselves and become something else.

407
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,560
The butterfly has forgotten it was a caterpillar.

408
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,080
Perhaps it will turn, the butterfly will become a fish.

409
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,119
Now, that's what is the lower nature?

410
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:39,840
That's lower immediacy, where they just, you go after this thing and that thing, and since none of them define you, if they don't satisfy you, you don't, you drop them and go after something else.

411
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:44,400
Deeper natures never forget themselves and never become something other than they were.

412
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:45,519
What's that?

413
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,119
That's higher immediacy.

414
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:50,319
The knight will remember everything, and so forth.

415
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:50,799
Yeah.

416
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:55,359
Well, it's interesting that you may have it without realizing it.

417
00:41:55,360 --> 00:42:09,920
It's certainly not something, but it's something you all know about because there are so many, I mean, in our tradition, romantic love has been described and analyzed in so many movies and so many novels and so many poems and so many TV shows.

418
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,760
You know that you can be in love and not realize it.

419
00:42:13,759 --> 00:42:16,080
Proust has it, the French are best at this.

420
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:21,760
Proust has a great description of that when Swan is in love and doesn't know it.

421
00:42:21,759 --> 00:42:33,119
But what's happening, somebody observing it might know it, that they want to be near this other person all the time, that they're maybe, in the case of Swan, jealous that somebody else might be with them, and so forth.

422
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:38,159
Now, sooner or later, you'll presumably discover it, but maybe not.

423
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:40,639
I mean, it's not a question of what you think.

424
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:43,040
It's a question of how your world is organized.

425
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:51,639
If everything that person does is centered to you, and what you do, you decide on the basis of where they are and what kind of thing they're into and so forth.

426
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:59,639
You could be in love with them in the sense of they could be the defining thing in your life, whether you thought about it or not.

427
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:01,159
I think that's important.

428
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,200
And we might as well say another thing.

429
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:05,400
It takes a while.

430
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,479
This is all stuff you all know already to get into being in love.

431
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:14,920
It doesn't happen in an instant, where an instant means sort of, I don't know, an hour.

432
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:22,119
Kierkegaard says it does happen in an instant, with a capital I, so to speak, as a technical term.

433
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:31,719
That he calls an instant whatever amount of time it takes for this relationship to become defining for you.

434
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:38,600
And that might happen in, you know, love at first sight in an evening or something, and it might take years.

435
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:42,520
And he talks about it on the next page.

436
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,880
I think it's the next page.

437
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:49,720
No, the next page is a bad page, but we're not ready to see Kierkegaard's mistakes.

438
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:52,119
Well, let me see.

439
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,600
It should be very near here.

440
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,600
It must be right in front of me.

441
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,919
Where he lets it twine about every league.

442
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,199
Yeah, on 71.

443
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:12,680
All of this, all the kind of description of the essential experiences taking place here on 70 and 71 and 72, about eight lines down on 71.

444
00:44:12,679 --> 00:44:21,800
He first makes sure that this really is the content of his life, and his soul is too healthy and proud to squander the least thing on an infatuation.

445
00:44:21,799 --> 00:44:28,119
He's not cowardly, not afraid, and now this is what happens in this instant, which may be a year, who knows.

446
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:36,960
He's not afraid to let his love steal in upon his most secret and most hidden thoughts, to let it twine itself in countless coils around every ligament of his consciousness.

447
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,480
You see, it colors everything that he experiences.

448
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,040
If the love becomes unhappy, he will never be able to wrench himself free of it.

449
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,200
That's important.

450
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:48,639
But let me read a little bit more.

451
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:55,760
He feels a blissful rapture when he, so every nerve and so forth for the moment, for this moment is life and death.

452
00:44:55,759 --> 00:45:02,080
Well, that means, in a Kierkegaard view, now this is sort of super romantic love.

453
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:09,840
And you'll see in the end, he sort of takes back this claim that he makes it now at the right, and it's right to make it at this point.

454
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,400
You'd only get one defining commitment.

455
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:18,479
After all, if that's your definition, it's like the definition of the triangle having three sides.

456
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,719
Necessarily, triangles have three sides.

457
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:22,239
They always have three sides.

458
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:24,800
They couldn't stop having three sides.

459
00:45:24,799 --> 00:45:50,960
And if this is your defining thing, being the lover of Beatrice, say, or whatever, and then you got, and you let that become your way of seeing yourself and your way of seeing everything else, then it's become so much a part of you, so embodied, so much in your way you see and do everything, that you can't get rid of it.

460
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,800
You could betray it.

461
00:45:52,799 --> 00:45:59,359
That is, you could, in some way, the only case I know of, and it is sort of dramatic.

462
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,520
How many have read 1984?

463
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:02,879
Okay, great.

464
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,519
Wow.

465
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:09,839
Well, if I remember it right, and tell me if I don't, that the whole thing that keeps, what's the name of the main character?

466
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:10,560
I don't remember.

467
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,279
I can't hear you.

468
00:46:11,279 --> 00:46:12,000
Somebody in the front.

469
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:17,919
Winston, the only thing that keeps Winston able to be his own self is his love for this woman.

470
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,159
What's her name?

471
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:19,799
Sylvia?

472
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:21,319
Julia.

473
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:22,839
Okay, Winston and Julia.

474
00:46:22,839 --> 00:46:37,720
Anyway, but in the end, if I remember right, because the bad forces know this fear of rats, when he's finally about to be eaten alive by the rats, he says he wishes it would happen to her and not to him, right?

475
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:44,680
And at that moment, he realizes that he's, instead of being a martyr, he has betrayed the love.

476
00:46:44,679 --> 00:46:46,839
And from that moment on, he's just a zombie.

477
00:46:46,839 --> 00:46:49,479
I mean, they can do anything they want with him, isn't that right?

478
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:58,520
I mean, he's no longer got any principles, any focus, any meaning on the basis of which to resist the powers.

479
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,919
So, I mean, that's what it would be to betray him.

480
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:14,360
That is, to do some, to actually put your interests ahead of what this calling requires of you.

481
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:18,759
You can do that, but if you do, this is the metaphor, you'll pull out your whole consciousness.

482
00:47:18,759 --> 00:47:23,159
That's what Kierkegaard's trying to say with the twins about every ligament of your consciousness.

483
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:25,400
That's what happens to Winston.

484
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,159
Okay, let me see.

485
00:47:27,159 --> 00:47:29,319
I've got to find out fast where we are.

486
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,319
It related to your question about how you know about it.

487
00:47:33,319 --> 00:47:34,520
Who asked that again?

488
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,600
Okay, it's interesting that that's a Greek kind of question, and I've written down here.

489
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:45,320
It's not, from a philosophical point of view, you ought to reflect, you ought to analyze your life.

490
00:47:45,319 --> 00:47:49,800
An unexamined life is not worth living, a famous Socrates comment.

491
00:47:49,799 --> 00:47:52,519
This says, never mind examining your life.

492
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:59,400
The important thing is to do what in each moment is required of you according to your calling.

493
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:04,799
And you don't have to know what it is, what the calling is in a reflective sort of way.

494
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:09,279
All you have to do is see the world in the perspective that it gives you.

495
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:22,720
So the idea that it's important to get the only reason it's important to examine your life is to get from here to here, from lower immediacy to mediation.

496
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:34,480
Once you get here, then if you get called to go here, and you can't do it by your willpower, it has to be, you don't fall in love by deciding to fall in love or get a cause by deciding to have a cause.

497
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:43,280
But if a cause or a person grabs you, then up here, you don't go back here and try to analyze whether you're really up there.

498
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,960
That's part of the, again, the Judeo-Christian versus the Greek.

499
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:56,799
And another way to put that is you don't try to find out what are the defining features of the person you love.

500
00:48:56,799 --> 00:48:58,159
That's sort of interesting.

501
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:00,400
That's to treat it as objective.

502
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,520
And then you think, well, let's see.

503
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:12,159
The person is smart, strong, sexy, and stylish, and witty, and compassionate.

504
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:18,720
That's all these wonderful features of the defining, of the lady, let's say, for the night.

505
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:21,119
But that can't be right.

506
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:33,839
Because if that were right, then if there were a bunch of objective characteristics that made that person adorable for you, then somebody could come along and score higher on the scales of sexy, strong, smart, stylish, witty.

507
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:36,480
And then you'd have to drop the first one for the second one.

508
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,639
And that's just exactly against the whole notion of this defining commitment.

509
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:48,240
So, what you have to think is, this person defines what it is to be smart, strong, sexy, stylish, witty, compassionate.

510
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:53,639
There couldn't be any higher case of it because they're the paradigm case of it.

511
00:49:53,639 --> 00:49:59,400
Anybody else would just be stupidly funny or brutishly sexy or whatever.

512
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:06,600
And this is the adorable one must look to you like not like just the best thing.

513
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:14,679
Here's another way to put it: not just like the best thing in the world, highest ranking on all the scales that matter for you.

514
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,680
It's something that defines your world.

515
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:23,159
And it's the paradigm case of all the things that matter to you.

516
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:27,319
And therefore, it can't be mediated.

517
00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:27,879
We're back to that.

518
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,840
That got just another way of saying it can't be mediated.

519
00:50:31,799 --> 00:50:32,839
And yeah.

520
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,080
Okay, wait.

521
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,919
This is a very important issue.

522
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:49,320
It's exactly the issue of nights of resignation for next time.

523
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:56,200
Yeah, so there is all this about whether it's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.

524
00:50:56,199 --> 00:50:58,919
I think, well, never mind.

525
00:51:00,759 --> 00:51:06,679
No, well, you're a knight of resignation, but I can't explain what that means yet.

526
00:51:06,679 --> 00:51:08,040
Go ahead.

527
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:22,360
I think he thinks that if you're, he doesn't say anything about this, but I think he thinks that, and it may be tied up with because he's still got a view that, no, no, no, no, I'm not thinking out loud.

528
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,080
I mean, he doesn't say anything, but it ought to be the case.

529
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:37,520
It better be the case, that anybody has plenty of opportunities to have a call, and if they're not resisting it, resisting the vulnerability of it and so forth.

530
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:38,239
We'll get to that.

531
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:44,319
But if he didn't, he'd be in this position of sort of saying that some people are just damned.

532
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:49,680
That is, some people are stuck in despair all their lives, and it's not their fault, and there's nothing they can do about it.

533
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:55,119
I don't think he thinks everybody, I know where he says it in the introduction, just a second.

534
00:51:55,119 --> 00:52:00,560
He says, in the world of the spirit, it always, so to speak, turns out all right.

535
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,240
I'll show you the passage.

536
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:06,800
And that really commits him to the view that we're talking about.

537
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,040
Where is that?

538
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:09,839
It's very important.

539
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:11,600
I was going to read it anyway.

540
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,720
Huh?

541
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:20,560
It should be right before the reflections on Abraham.

542
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:22,320
It's going to be here somewhere.

543
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:22,960
No?

544
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,159
Way back there.

545
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,960
If you're right, that's a good thing you told me before.

546
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,879
Yeah, that's where it is.

547
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,240
The beginning here.

548
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:43,680
He says in the first paragraph that in the ordinary world, it isn't the case that every time the one who works gets the bread.

549
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:47,119
There are people who don't have to work at all, and they get all this good food.

550
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:52,400
There are people who work and work, and they're in the working class, and they're very hungry lots of the time.

551
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,280
That's how it is in the outward world.

552
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:02,959
But, and now about 15 lines down on 57, it is otherwise in the world of the spirit.

553
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,760
Here there prevails an eternal divine order.

554
00:53:05,759 --> 00:53:08,480
Here it does not rain on the just and the unjust alike.

555
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,039
Here the sun does not shine on both good and evil.

556
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:15,680
There's only the oh here only one who works gets the bread.

557
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:21,400
And that, and every, and I think it follows that everyone who works gets the bread and so forth.

558
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,079
But so that's okay.

559
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:24,999
That's the yeah.

560
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:29,560
What's your free?

561
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:30,279
You are free.

562
00:53:30,279 --> 00:53:30,759
That's right.

563
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,439
You're free to accept it or not accept it.

564
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,280
And it's very important.

565
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:41,080
And you're free, once you've accepted it, to take different stands on it.

566
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:44,119
Both of those things I want to say for a minute.

567
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:54,440
Because that's the next question is what do you do when something's calling you, when you're about to be taken up into one of these relations?

568
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,919
And you can resist it.

569
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,600
And there's good reasons to resist it.

570
00:53:58,759 --> 00:53:59,320
Okay?

571
00:53:59,639 --> 00:54:03,159
Do you believe the legal or whatever that feels?

572
00:54:03,799 --> 00:54:08,199
I don't know, but I don't think it matters, Kierkegaard.

573
00:54:08,199 --> 00:54:15,560
I think it's at the level of everybody, you're all asking me to say things that he doesn't say, but I think he would say.

574
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,440
Everybody's open to getting a calling.

575
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:22,360
Everybody can have one if they're just ready for it.

576
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,520
It's sort of, again, the romantic love tradition.

577
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:32,600
There's nobody, no matter how sort of peculiar or seemingly unattractive, who can't find somebody who loves them or can't find somebody to love.

578
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,079
It's that kind of story again.

579
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:45,559
And it's open to everybody to resist falling in love because they just don't want to take on that vulnerability.

580
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,679
I've got to get there.

581
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:47,079
Yeah.

582
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:01,240
Yes, but you are, yes, you're showing that he's a knight of resignation.

583
00:55:01,239 --> 00:55:02,359
Don't do it yet.

584
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,480
Next lecture.

585
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,279
Okay, now I've got to stick with this one.

586
00:55:05,279 --> 00:55:07,040
There's so much I want to cover.

587
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:17,119
So I want to go back and tell you something that I didn't, that I'm making, that I'm, I didn't really stress it.

588
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:22,080
It doesn't change anything I wrote here, but you can't give it up.

589
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:22,960
I'm going to see.

590
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:28,080
Okay, I'm going to give you nine characteristics of the defining relation now.

591
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,440
What I've done is given you a few of them without naming them.

592
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,279
So let me go catch up.

593
00:55:33,279 --> 00:55:51,200
So what makes you an individual gives you a world in which the and in that world I want to make that distinction again between the most important thing in your world is not what this is about.

594
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:57,919
The defining commitment isn't the important thing in your world like any other important thing in your world.

595
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,040
It gives you a world.

596
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:08,400
Why that I mean it determines what is trivial and what is serious, what is relevant and irrelevant, what is meaningful and meaningless.

597
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:13,520
So in that sense, it focuses your world.

598
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:19,840
And you didn't have a world in this Kierkegaard sense until you've got it.

599
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:25,200
Everything that's crucial for you gets referred back to this relation.

600
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:29,119
And it determines what's important.

601
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,639
It determines how you behave.

602
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:33,360
Not determines in the sense of make you're not free.

603
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:45,279
It's just the things that show up to do, to freely do, are all come out of this relationship because it's always been promoting this relationship and remaining true to this relationship.

604
00:56:45,279 --> 00:56:49,600
The things look important, or if they're not doing that, they look unimportant.

605
00:56:50,279 --> 00:56:59,399
Now, number three, and that was what I did when I talked about the strong and stylish and witty and all that, it can't be mediated.

606
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:03,320
You can't put the divining commitment into concepts.

607
00:57:03,639 --> 00:57:06,280
And now I'm ready for another one.

608
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:13,079
And this is a very Kierkegaardian one: your passion or your commitment produces its object.

609
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,159
And what does that mean?

610
00:57:15,159 --> 00:57:21,080
That means that it's because you have this infinite passion for somebody.

611
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:24,920
We'll take a person, of course, it could always be a cause.

612
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:30,360
But let's just say, but if you have this infinite passion for somebody, then they are adorable for you.

613
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,119
And they are your savior.

614
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:34,199
That's what Dante thought about Beatrice.

615
00:57:34,199 --> 00:57:36,760
That's what the Knights thought about their ladies.

616
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,320
They aren't objectively adorable.

617
00:57:39,319 --> 00:57:41,080
And objectively the same.

618
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,440
It's only while you're adoring them that they're adorable.

619
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:50,839
And only while they're saving you, that is giving your life a meaning and making you an individual that they're your savior.

620
00:57:50,839 --> 00:57:55,560
So Kierkegaard makes the slogan: truth is subjectivity.

621
00:57:55,560 --> 00:58:04,200
That means that they are your savior is a result of how you are true to them.

622
00:58:04,199 --> 00:58:04,679
Yeah.

623
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,679
To commit to God.

624
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:15,560
Wow.

625
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,720
Have you taken Philosophy VI?

626
00:58:17,719 --> 00:58:19,240
Have you read Dante?

627
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:25,399
This is a whole story behind this, and I'm so tempted to get into it, but I can't.

628
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,960
Dante blows it at the end.

629
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:31,320
At the end of the Divine Comedy, he drops Beatrice for God.

630
00:58:31,319 --> 00:58:34,600
That's a big mistake from Kierkegaard's point of view.

631
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:42,159
That's what happens when you let the Judeo-Christian tradition get gobbled up by the God of the philosophers.

632
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:46,240
Dante finally drops Beatrice for the God of the Philosophers.

633
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:48,960
He hasn't really got it yet.

634
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,720
That's the move that Kierkegaard makes beyond Dante.

635
00:58:53,679 --> 00:59:06,319
Anyway, so when I talk about Dante and Beatrice, I always talk about Dante before he gets to the top of paradise and gets zapped by God, after which he just becomes a kind of zombie.

636
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:09,679
That is, a quote, the end of the divine comedy, the last two lines.

637
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:10,319
Didn't I say this?

638
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:11,439
I don't guess I didn't.

639
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:15,760
His love becomes one with the love that moves the sun and the other stars.

640
00:59:15,759 --> 00:59:17,439
Wipes him out as an individual.

641
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:23,039
He's just one more something or other contemplating God.

642
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,480
That's a medieval idea.

643
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,199
That's the Judeo-Christian tradition sort of gobbling up the...

644
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:34,960
Sorry, that's the Greek tradition gobbling up the Judeo.

645
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,320
Is that what you're asking?

646
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:43,920
So, yes, Kierkegaard thinks Dante did give up Beatrice, and that was really a bad thing to do.

647
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,240
I have there's words for that, but I don't want to stop with them.

648
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,479
So the next, that was number four.

649
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,719
The passion produces its object.

650
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:54,719
Truth is subjectivity.

651
00:59:55,600 --> 01:00:02,880
It's not, in Kierkegaard jargon, he also says, it's not the what, but the how of the relation that matters.

652
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:08,480
Meaning, it's the infinite passion, not any objective features.

653
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:15,999
Okay, next, it's necessary and accidental, which is a very peculiar, interesting thing.

654
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:27,560
Normally, if something is necessary, it's true for all time, and it's true under all conditions, and that would be like a triangle has three sides.

655
01:00:28,759 --> 01:00:30,119
And that's a definition.

656
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:34,199
And definitions should be necessary and true for all kinds.

657
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:36,600
If it's a triangle, it's going to have three sides.

658
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,680
That's true of any definition.

659
01:00:38,679 --> 01:00:44,039
But this peculiar kind of definition is bizarre.

660
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:51,320
And it starts at a certain moment in time that you're defined as, say, the lover of Beatrice.

661
01:00:51,319 --> 01:01:04,280
And if you now think of it in terms of romantic love and so forth, it's a sheer accident that you happened, that you were in this college and in this lecture, and that you met the person who was your defining commitment if you did.

662
01:01:04,839 --> 01:01:06,839
It's on a plane.

663
01:01:06,839 --> 01:01:20,999
And how you get this defining object for you seems totally accidental until it becomes your defining relation, at which it becomes necessary for the new you that is produced by it.

664
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:36,200
Because if you are defined as the lover of Mary, then you weren't, and then you got zapped by Mary, and now you are, and now the kind, the you that you've become couldn't have been otherwise.

665
01:01:36,199 --> 01:01:43,239
Now that's very peculiar, and it leads things, people to say things like they were destined for each other for all eternity.

666
01:01:43,239 --> 01:01:51,080
Because look at that, how could they be defined in terms of this love if it wasn't already somehow settled?

667
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:56,280
You can't just be that they accidentally signed up for this class and not some other.

668
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:59,639
So Kierkegaard's got this peculiar interesting story.

669
01:01:59,639 --> 01:02:10,720
What from a Greek point of view is definitions are necessary and if they aren't necessary, they're just accidental.

670
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:21,520
He got a notion that something could become necessary in time and then you become defined that way and then even your past gets redefined.

671
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:32,079
So you can only remember that you once were a person, once we're living in a world that was empty and you didn't know who you were because now you know who you are and you know that you were missing it.

672
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:33,679
But at the time, you didn't.

673
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,559
It's just a funny, very funny kind of thing.

674
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:40,240
There's a Platonic detached necessity for triangles.

675
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:49,280
And there's a Judeo-Christian existential necessity that Kierkegaard's onto.

676
01:02:52,719 --> 01:02:56,400
Something can start to be necessary at a moment of time.

677
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,000
That's number five.

678
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,720
And that structures the whole temporal field in an instant with a capital I.

679
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:08,560
That is, at the moment that you get your defining commitment, when the moment could last a year.

680
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:12,080
I'm going to call it the instant, could last a year or two or whatever.

681
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:21,360
At that instant, everything gets redefined in such a way that your past looks different to you and your future looks different to you.

682
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:25,840
And that's what I call restructures the temporal field.

683
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:29,840
Now, moreover, you get a new kind of eternity.

684
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:41,920
Not the kind that you get in Plato where you contemplate the formal structure of the universe and the mathematical relations, but a kind of eternity that happens in an instant.

685
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:48,240
And now I have to explain that, where Kierkegaard says, only in existing do I become eternal.

686
01:03:48,239 --> 01:03:58,840
I mean, that sounds like complete wackiness, because after all, the logical relations are eternal, and math is eternal, and even the laws of physics are presumably eternal.

687
01:03:58,839 --> 01:04:01,880
But this is a kind of eternal that's quite different.

688
01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:07,159
And now I can do it fast by sort of drawing on how he pictures it.

689
01:04:07,159 --> 01:04:13,720
So if you're living in time, these are moments, not instants, moments, moments, moments.

690
01:04:13,719 --> 01:04:18,279
And the thing about these moments is they're always up for grabs retroactively.

691
01:04:18,279 --> 01:04:25,960
So now you think you're having a great time being in Berkeley, but at exam time you may think that it's the biggest mistake you ever made.

692
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:29,560
And then you finally recover from that and you're happy again.

693
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:36,359
And you go back and then you graduate and you think this was a great experience and then later you think not and so forth.

694
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:45,080
You constantly have to reinterpret your experience because it's in time and time is just up for reinterpretation.

695
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:50,760
But if there's an instant in it where you get a defining relation, it all gets to be different.

696
01:04:50,759 --> 01:05:00,119
You now know that for the whole rest of your life, which for you is forever, it's the only kind of personal, we're talking about a personal kind of eternity.

697
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:12,200
For the whole rest of your life, everything that's important will hang upon the justice of the black people or for your relation to Mary.

698
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:17,000
And even the past gets reinterpreted as it was empty.

699
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,999
I was lost until they found it.

700
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:28,280
I mean, Gustin is very good about explaining the different way he experienced his life before he became a Christian and how he looked at the same experiences afterward.

701
01:05:28,279 --> 01:05:41,759
So there is this retroactive quality to it, and you get to be eternal in this peculiar sense, which is the way to do it is to always think of this as eternal equals forever.

702
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:48,320
Because eternal sounds too Greek, it sounds like what mathematical relations are.

703
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:51,520
Forever is the eternal for me.

704
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,199
It's the existential eternal.

705
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:58,720
I mean, it means for my whole life, for anything I could care about, the meaning is fixed.

706
01:05:58,719 --> 01:06:01,600
And that's the eternal forever story.

707
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,400
Now, it's also reversible.

708
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,240
You can't go from one defining relation to another.

709
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:09,359
Now, we've talked about that.

710
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:11,439
It would be like tearing out your consciousness.

711
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:14,960
Luckily, I don't have to go into it again because there's not much time.

712
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,839
But the bottom line for all this is number nine.

713
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,040
That was eight.

714
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:19,999
It was irreversible.

715
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,839
Number nine, it makes you completely vulnerable.

716
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:25,520
That's the problem.

717
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:29,440
You put all your eggs in this basket, so to speak.

718
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:34,960
The meaning of your life and your world and what it makes sense to do it all is tied up in this.

719
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:39,840
And it has to be a relation to something finite and temporal.

720
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:44,800
It can't be a relation to a scientific theory like Galileo.

721
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:58,799
When they said that the Inquisition would torture him if he didn't take back his claim that the earth moves around the sun, he took it back and supposedly muttered under his breath as he left the courtroom, but it moves anyway.

722
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:00,719
It doesn't require him.

723
01:07:00,719 --> 01:07:02,720
It's an objective truth.

724
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:24,199
But it turns out that if it's a kind of existential commitment, not a scientific theory, then it has to be to something concrete enough, finite enough, temporal enough, like a human being or a cause, to give your life meaning every minute of the time.

725
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:30,039
So when you wake up in the morning, you know what you have to do, like Martin Luther King in my picture.

726
01:07:30,759 --> 01:07:36,919
But if it's relation to something finite and temporal, then of course it's something vulnerable.

727
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:43,560
The cause may fail, the lover may leave, and this is terribly crazy and upsetting.

728
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:55,159
Nobody would want to get into a relationship that's going to plunge them into grief and destroy their happiness and their world if it fails when it could fail any time.

729
01:07:55,160 --> 01:08:00,679
I think this is what it means to say that this relationship is impossible, as Kierkegaard said sometimes.

730
01:08:00,679 --> 01:08:07,480
It's impossible in the sense that if you think about it rationally, it doesn't make any sense to get into this relationship.

731
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:12,119
Anything that this is important ought to be completely solid.

732
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:18,919
And yet this is so important and unsolid that, and therefore, I'll just jump ahead to the night.

733
01:08:18,999 --> 01:08:19,480
No, I don't.

734
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:20,119
No, I won't.

735
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:22,360
I stick to this for a minute.

736
01:08:22,999 --> 01:08:27,480
So it's fragile, it's not guaranteed, and yet you're building everything on it.

737
01:08:27,799 --> 01:08:38,919
And the temptation is to avoid it by doing a kind of Buddhist move, say, for non-attachment, a Plato move, merging with the good.

738
01:08:38,919 --> 01:08:50,999
Every religion has a way of taking the risk away, making it possible that you can have some kind of meaning without it.

739
01:08:50,999 --> 01:08:56,560
But Christianity wants, even Christianity, and that's the Dante question.

740
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,919
Even Christianity says, well, Dante doesn't finally really need Beatrice in the end.

741
01:09:00,919 --> 01:09:05,759
It doesn't matter whether she dies or not, or whether he gets married to somebody else and all that.

742
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:10,879
It doesn't matter because his real goal is contemplation of God and God is eternal.

743
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:19,520
And so the eternal in him merges with the eternal in God, but not in Kierkegaard's Christianity.

744
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:25,600
Kierkegaard thinks that the unconditional commitment has to be to something finite.

745
01:09:25,919 --> 01:09:31,600
It's the most rewarding of all human experiences and the most risky.

746
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,279
And now what do you do about that?

747
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:37,119
That's what I wanted to be sure and get to by 5 o'clock.

748
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:48,560
It would be great, wouldn't it, if there was a way to save the meaning of the unconditional commitment while at the same time getting rid of the vulnerability?

749
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:53,520
That's whoever, somebody here came up and said after class, is there any way to do that?

750
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:54,240
And who is he?

751
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:55,119
Somebody here?

752
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,839
Anyway, that's the right question to ask next.

753
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:16,079
And now, next time, I'm going to tell you about all the possible maneuvers that you could make to avoid the vulnerability and the one particular interesting maneuver you could make that not only avoids the vulnerability but saves the meaning.

754
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:24,560
That saves the fact that your life is defined by this relationship, but puts the relationship out of risk.

755
01:10:24,879 --> 01:10:27,440
That's the final thing.

756
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,360
Now, I think we should stop with that.

757
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,959
That's the subject for next time.

758
01:10:30,959 --> 01:10:37,119
But just so you know when you're reading what we're talking about, that's the move of the night of resignation.

759
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:37,919
Okay.
