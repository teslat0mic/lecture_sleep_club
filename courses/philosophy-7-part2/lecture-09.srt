1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,760
I'm looking for what I had and read last time from Huck Finn because by happy coincidence, since this is about podcasting partly, but as I told you last time, by happy good luck, some podcast listener sent me the quotes from Huck Finn where he is suspending the ethical.

2
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,481
And I read them and it seemed terrific to me.

3
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,000
And then I got another message.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,601
I get email every day from some podcast listener who said there's a problem.

5
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:40,481
It's not like suspending the ethical.

6
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,321
And I think it's very interesting.

7
00:00:42,321 --> 00:00:43,441
They're both right.

8
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:53,760
And the issue is over this quote, which I'll just read the basic part of it, where he has the letter that he's going to send to tell Mrs.

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,040
Watson where her slave, Jim, is.

10
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,400
And he says, I took it up, I held it, the letter, in my hand.

11
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:08,800
I was all trembling because I'd got to decide forever betwixt two things, and I knowed it.

12
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:17,440
I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then I says to myself, all right, I'll go to hell, and tore it up.

13
00:01:17,441 --> 00:01:25,680
It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they were said, and I let them stay said, and I never thought no more about reforming.

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:37,440
Well, that sounds certainly like a case of suspending the ethical, of doing something which he feels he has to do, and yet he knows that it's morally wrong.

15
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:39,920
And as he says, he knows he's going to go to hell.

16
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,400
He's trembling.

17
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:48,441
I take that to be the Mark Twain version of anguish that he feels when he has to go against the ethical.

18
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:57,321
And it's utterly unintelligible what he's doing to him or anybody else because it's absolutely part of the ethical that slaves are property and property.

19
00:01:57,321 --> 00:01:59,720
You don't go around stealing other people's property.

20
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:02,921
And he's in effect stealing Jim.

21
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:04,680
Why isn't it?

22
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:15,480
Does anybody figure out why I would get another podcast email telling me that this is not the right way to explain the suspension of the ethical?

23
00:02:16,121 --> 00:02:18,601
Well, it's an interesting, deep issue.

24
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:22,120
Somebody writes and says, yeah, but on the name of what?

25
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:27,800
He doesn't have any unconditional commitment to anybody or anything that is making him do it.

26
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:41,640
When Kierkegaard writes about the suspension of the ethical, remember, he says that it's the call, Abraham's calling, that makes him go against the ethical.

27
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:51,400
And I generalize that to say that if you're in love or if you have any kind of unconditional commitment, then the commitment has higher authority than the ethical.

28
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:54,840
And if it conflicts with the ethical, it trumps the ethical.

29
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,601
But now, what about Huck Finn?

30
00:02:56,601 --> 00:02:59,001
What's his unconditional commitment?

31
00:02:59,001 --> 00:03:00,920
Well, I don't think he has any.

32
00:03:00,921 --> 00:03:07,480
And in that sense, the latest letter from the podcast world is right.

33
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:14,680
It's not exactly an example of Abraham's kind of suspending the ethical.

34
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,001
Or my examples from when I did it.

35
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:41,601
Remember, I said, suppose you were homosexual and in love with somebody in 18850 in Copenhagen, then you would have the same problem that what you were doing was, when you tried to say it, you could only say that you were depraved and perverted, and yet you would feel that this is what you were called to do and the best thing you could be doing.

36
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:49,200
Well, Huck, the answer is something like this: the Huck Finn is a kind of half of it.

37
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,640
It's the sort of bare bones of the story.

38
00:03:52,640 --> 00:04:11,040
That is, if the essence of it is that you feel that you have to go against the ethical, and you feel the anguish of having to go against the ethical, but you feel that it would be even worse if you didn't, you're already suspending the ethical.

39
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:16,001
And so the Huck Finn is like a very minimal case.

40
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:30,800
But it's a special case of the general story that something requires you, some higher power over you requires you to go against the ethical.

41
00:04:30,801 --> 00:04:33,040
Then there seem to be at least two kinds.

42
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:36,640
Maybe there are three or four kinds, and maybe somebody wants to write a paper about it.

43
00:04:36,640 --> 00:05:00,080
The two kinds we've come across now are: you have a defining unconditional commitment that requires you to go, could require you to go against the ethical and does sometimes do it, or you just have some, I don't know, innate sense of decency or something, I don't know what Huck has, which requires you to go against the ethical.

44
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,401
And in both cases, the crucial thing is you can't justify what you're doing.

45
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:11,881
If you try to describe what you're doing, you have to say it's bad.

46
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:16,441
Huck says that this is bad, and he's going to hell for it.

47
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,121
And he's serious about it.

48
00:05:18,121 --> 00:05:18,921
He's trembling.

49
00:05:18,921 --> 00:05:22,681
He knows it's an awful thing that he's done.

50
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,881
And that was, so just let me finish.

51
00:05:25,881 --> 00:05:32,520
So that's the crucial thing, that you have to go against the ethical, and you can't justify what you're doing.

52
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:44,681
And if you try to justify what you're doing, you can only justify it in terms of what is the shared, intelligible understanding of what's right and wrong and good.

53
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:59,481
And by the shared understanding of what's right and wrong and good, when you can't justify it, because you have to say, I'm a slave protector, which is a terrible thing to be, apparently.

54
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,920
Or you have to say, I'm a murderer, which is what Abraham has to say.

55
00:06:04,921 --> 00:06:12,280
Or you could have to say, I'm going to break my engagement to Regina, which is what Kierkegaard has to say.

56
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:20,920
All of which are, when described from the point of view of the ethical, and that's the only way they can be described, are bad.

57
00:06:20,921 --> 00:06:22,040
Okay, now, question.

58
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:22,200
Yeah.

59
00:06:22,441 --> 00:06:26,601
Kierkegaard likens faith to being a non-conditional method to God.

60
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,520
So we're.

61
00:06:30,121 --> 00:06:34,520
I was hoping I could get by the whole semester this year and nobody would ask me that question.

62
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:45,881
But I can't make any sense out of the role of God in the way Kierkegaard is telling the story, and I don't think Kierkegaard does either.

63
00:06:45,881 --> 00:06:59,441
Because what happens is that God just stands for whatever calling it is that requires you to go against the ethical because it's higher than the ethical.

64
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:10,720
And God isn't some other authority, some supreme being, which sends Abraham a method, a message, and you go against the ethical.

65
00:07:12,481 --> 00:07:19,441
And it isn't as if everybody understands that when God asks for something to be done as a sacrifice, it's okay.

66
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,760
Nobody thinks it's okay for Abraham to go out and murder Isaac.

67
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,841
Even Abraham doesn't think it's okay.

68
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:37,040
But God stands for the fact that there is some authority, some higher calling, which is requiring Abraham to do it.

69
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:43,441
But in the Abraham story, you can't make any sense of it when you try to translate it because in the Abraham story, it was Yahweh.

70
00:07:43,441 --> 00:07:47,041
It was God, the supreme, it wasn't even the supreme being yet.

71
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,640
That's sort of too Greek.

72
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,121
It was Jehovah who was commanding it.

73
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:59,600
And Kierkegaard just can't turn that into the story that he wants it to be.

74
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,961
So he just puts it in.

75
00:08:01,121 --> 00:08:17,200
But he doesn't say much about it because, as I've told you before, when he does talk about God in another book where he's talking about what he thinks the right way to think about Christianity is, he doesn't think God is a supreme object or being.

76
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:23,121
He says God is that all things are possible, and that all things are possible is God.

77
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:28,561
And having faith isn't believing that there is this kind of supreme being.

78
00:08:28,561 --> 00:08:38,481
Having faith is acting as if all things are possible, acting in the field of the shining of this power.

79
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:54,121
And you'll see, but this won't mean anything to you quite yet, when he does actually mention some, the sort of creation, the creator, sort of, he mentions it with lowercase.

80
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,161
He talks about the power that posited it.

81
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,641
He doesn't have a creator God in his story.

82
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,840
That help any?

83
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,721
I mean, it says in it.

84
00:09:03,801 --> 00:09:06,601
What it helps is that there's nothing to say.

85
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:13,081
Don't get tangled up in talking about God the Father or God the Supreme Being or Jehovah in this story.

86
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:22,681
Don't let the fact that Kierkegaard can't quite map his problems onto Abraham's problems, mess up what you're doing.

87
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:25,001
Keep your eye on the phenomenon.

88
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:43,720
That's always the keeping your eye on the phenomenon is thinking, well, some authority says to Abraham, you got to kill Isaac, and that authority is something that nobody else can understand, nobody else can, nor Abraham himself, but he feels he has to do it.

89
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,200
Yeah.

90
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,960
But it seems like the ethical is pulling him in two directions.

91
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,681
But there isn't something tired of the ethical, sort of telling him to stay in Jim.

92
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:56,441
Rather, something like, well, on the one hand, he's a human being.

93
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:57,640
And on the other hand...

94
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,121
Well, he thinks you're right, sort of.

95
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,641
I think, let me put it back this way.

96
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:09,401
The way it works with Huck is that there's something bad going to happen, and he's being called to prevent it, namely giving Huck back.

97
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,321
That's another way of putting the difference.

98
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:27,761
When it's the love of the homosexual story, or the love of Regina story, or imagine Martin Luther King not being a non-violent person, but knowing he's got to kill some people to get the peace march going.

99
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:41,921
I mean, those are all things that you're called for the sake of something that is for you good, though you can't explain how or why, to do something which is ethically bad.

100
00:10:41,921 --> 00:10:54,161
It turns out that what happens with Huck is to avoid something ethically bad, namely, well, no, no, no, I guess I haven't got inside of it.

101
00:10:54,161 --> 00:10:55,681
Maybe you aren't inside of it either.

102
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,881
Let me try again.

103
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,521
The good thing is to return a runaway slave.

104
00:11:01,521 --> 00:11:04,961
And he thinks that that's a bad thing.

105
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:10,001
And he's therefore acting.

106
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:25,361
He's doing something which is bad by the current ethics, helping a runaway slave, and something he feels he has to do.

107
00:11:25,681 --> 00:11:26,960
I've lost it.

108
00:11:27,761 --> 00:11:28,401
Tell me again.

109
00:11:33,921 --> 00:11:34,480
Yes.

110
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,441
Well, okay, now I see why I lost it.

111
00:11:37,441 --> 00:11:43,761
But that can't be quite right because that's very important, what you're saying, because it's wrong.

112
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:47,361
But that's important to be wrong, because then you can get clear of what's right.

113
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:56,881
It can't be in the ethical sphere because the ethical sphere is what people agree on is the good, intelligible thing to do.

114
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:05,600
His conscience can't be, so to speak, calling him from Berkeley now, telling him, don't turn in slaves.

115
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,601
There aren't any real people, black people aren't slaves.

116
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:12,600
From the point of view of Huck, that's the important thing.

117
00:12:12,921 --> 00:12:17,801
The ethical is that you should turn in runaway slaves.

118
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:25,961
And his conscience, and this is the helpful way you put it, because it's misleading, is your conscience is supposed to tell you ethical things.

119
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:33,881
But in the way Kierkegaard has set it up, your conscience tells you what counts as good according to what everybody agrees on in the culture.

120
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,961
So his conscience tells him, turn in that runaway slave.

121
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,641
And so now we're left, but then why doesn't he do it?

122
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,321
And that's your interesting point.

123
00:12:43,321 --> 00:12:44,681
We don't really know.

124
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:54,761
I mean, looking at it from where we are, we have to say something like, well, his natural understanding of the value of all human beings or something.

125
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:56,281
And maybe that's right.

126
00:12:56,281 --> 00:12:59,881
But one thing you have to say is he can't put it that way.

127
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:04,281
His conscience can't say, but Jim is another human being.

128
00:13:04,281 --> 00:13:05,880
You can't just treat him like a slave.

129
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,641
His conscience says Jim is a piece of property and you're stealing him.

130
00:13:10,281 --> 00:13:12,360
And so his conscience says, give him back.

131
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,720
That's why he's trembling when he doesn't give him back.

132
00:13:16,441 --> 00:13:17,081
Okay?

133
00:13:18,441 --> 00:13:19,081
Yeah.

134
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,080
Well, good.

135
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:30,281
I think, I mean, there's a whole literature based on one sentence.

136
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:33,161
Come back to the raft huck, honey.

137
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:35,081
Do you know any of you know that?

138
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:44,441
I mean, and then they try to actually make a kind of homosexual attraction between the two of them and interpret it as, then it's easy.

139
00:13:45,001 --> 00:13:52,441
Then his love of Jim trumps the ethical, and he's really suspending the ethical.

140
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,441
But he can't say, I love Jim, and Mark Twain can't say it either.

141
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,360
And maybe that's the way to read it.

142
00:14:00,161 --> 00:14:05,601
Okay, did you do this on your own, or have you read this literature of Come Back to the Raft Huck Honey?

143
00:14:05,921 --> 00:14:06,561
No.

144
00:14:06,561 --> 00:14:09,600
Okay, it was a big thing when I was a graduate student.

145
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,200
I don't know whether anybody pays any attention to that way of reading the Huck Finn or not.

146
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,360
Has anybody read the sort of homosexual reading of Huck Finn?

147
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,441
Okay, well, I don't think we need to.

148
00:14:21,441 --> 00:14:37,761
But if you do, if you do, then you at least have a reason that trumps the ethical, that is something that they can't say to eat themselves or understand, but has authority, and that's nice for the symmetry.

149
00:14:37,761 --> 00:14:38,161
Yeah.

150
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,600
At the very end of the book, when Huck ultimately says, not the fact that Levin is, oh, you're right.

151
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,281
You know, slaves are real people.

152
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,041
He says, Jim, I love you despite the fact that you're hiring.

153
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:57,921
He says, especially throughout the book and especially after the letter, Huck is saying, I'm doing the anti-I'm doing the anti-ethical.

154
00:14:57,921 --> 00:14:58,161
You say.

155
00:14:58,161 --> 00:15:06,240
He actually overcomes the fact that Jim is a slave, because then you're my friend, despite the overwhelming.

156
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:06,960
Good.

157
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,761
So he's in just the right place.

158
00:15:10,001 --> 00:15:13,520
So now we can accept the podcast, the first podcast person.

159
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:15,521
Jim is in the right place.

160
00:15:15,521 --> 00:15:16,561
I mean, sorry.

161
00:15:16,561 --> 00:15:29,040
Huck is in this place where his kind of commitment to Jim is making him do something which he has no vocabulary and no understanding for how to say it.

162
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:32,481
And because when he says it, he says, I like to even though you're a slave.

163
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,881
And that's not the way it's supposed to.

164
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:38,561
I mean, that's not the how, what?

165
00:15:38,561 --> 00:15:41,721
That's that's to buy too.

166
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,761
Yeah, that's to buy too much into the ethical of that time and find him.

167
00:15:46,761 --> 00:15:48,200
But anyway, good.

168
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,001
That's interesting.

169
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,200
I mean, there's a great possibility of some paper in there trying to sort this all out if you're on the track of one.

170
00:15:56,921 --> 00:15:58,600
Yeah, yeah, both of you.

171
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,480
First you, yeah.

172
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:08,041
Of course, we have to ethical, which is kind of like a social register, well, intended to.

173
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:14,200
I think it's quite right to inject define that when we have humanistic ideals and other ideas we'll have in this thing.

174
00:16:15,401 --> 00:16:16,921
Our intelligibility, our ethics.

175
00:16:17,161 --> 00:16:23,241
Almost transcended the language of a higher calling, something exceeded.

176
00:16:23,401 --> 00:16:26,441
You could also come from a more feminine perspective.

177
00:16:26,441 --> 00:16:27,160
And this would.

178
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,241
A what perspective?

179
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,121
Oh, Berkson, yeah, the philosopher.

180
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,760
Okay, okay.

181
00:16:34,441 --> 00:16:35,001
Yeah, you're right.

182
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:47,321
We take all our different kinds of feelings and emotions where meaning comes from, and then the tree that we're solving.

183
00:16:47,321 --> 00:16:58,440
And so in this sense, it would be not necessarily a higher calling, but the emotional reaction sense of not only the order of interactions, I have to have some sense of.

184
00:16:58,521 --> 00:17:02,921
And so here, this is kind of a very interesting, interesting.

185
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,960
All the issues are in here.

186
00:17:04,281 --> 00:17:06,921
It really is an interesting topic, paper topic or something.

187
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,561
Now, let's put this in Hegel terms.

188
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:19,400
In Hegel terms, that would be that he doesn't turn in Jim because he gives him to lower immediacy, his own personal attachment.

189
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,600
And that means, and that would be to be sinning, to be doing evil, you know, bad.

190
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:33,680
How can he let his feelings about Jim trump what every right 30 thinking person knows you're supposed to do when you've got a runaway slave on your hands?

191
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:41,360
So that would get rid of the paradox, and it would get rid of the anguish and the trembling.

192
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:51,440
He would just he well, he would just be saying, Well, I don't care whether I'm damned, I'm going to make an exception of myself because I like it.

193
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,680
And that's that's bad.

194
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,400
I mean, that's that's normal sort of bad.

195
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,281
Okay?

196
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,561
Boy, you know, you can let her go on because she's already in the middle of a thought.

197
00:18:02,561 --> 00:18:02,881
Yeah.

198
00:18:03,521 --> 00:18:07,361
Because, I mean, Jim stays puffed innumerable times.

199
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,201
He yields it from the dead body.

200
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:22,561
When Jim has an author's need to run away, he comes back and hides like a p-ball for two weeks to stay Jim for like these really rough random villagers.

201
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:27,920
Like, what the ultimate lesson is the fact that Jim chooses the top.

202
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:29,441
Interesting.

203
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:36,880
I don't know what, I mean, there's not enough in my memory of the book to know what to say about how it looks from Jim's point of view.

204
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:45,281
All I want to say to you is that being sort of doing it from an existential Kierkegaard thing, the right question to ask is, how does it look from Jim's point of view?

205
00:18:45,281 --> 00:18:47,200
How does it look from Huck's point of view?

206
00:18:47,201 --> 00:18:49,760
And not how does it look from our point of view?

207
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,521
And that's what you're trying to do.

208
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:57,360
And Jim, for all, I mean, he says, come back to the RAF Huck, honey, we're back to that again.

209
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,561
He really likes him.

210
00:18:58,561 --> 00:19:00,640
I don't know what more to say about that.

211
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,200
Yeah.

212
00:19:02,481 --> 00:19:03,120
Yeah.

213
00:19:06,001 --> 00:19:06,840
No, wait, stop.

214
00:19:06,721 --> 00:19:07,080
Thought.

215
00:19:07,201 --> 00:19:07,921
No, no.

216
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,521
You you you left out uh something.

217
00:19:10,761 --> 00:19:13,880
The ethical is the universal in problem one.

218
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,080
That's Kantian sort of thing.

219
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:22,200
But remember now, we're sort of inside of problem two now, which is Hegelian, where we talked about this last time.

220
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:27,240
The ethical is whatever the shared norms of intelligibility and good action are.

221
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:30,600
So the ethical is certainly turn in the slaves.

222
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:37,801
And there isn't any Kantian ethical about all treat all human beings as means and as ends and not as means.

223
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:45,160
And it's only when you relativize the ethical like Hegel that you get the paradox like Kierkegaard, which makes Kierkegaard happy.

224
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,521
He likes paradoxes.

225
00:19:46,521 --> 00:19:46,840
Yeah.

226
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,281
An ethical value that's supposed to be above another.

227
00:19:52,281 --> 00:20:06,200
So like the technological aspect, so it's because for the more general sport of most the goodness for everyone for the social scheme at that time, for inclusion conversation.

228
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:15,481
What I wanted to note is: does Kierkegaard in mind that the conflict can take within the ethical of it?

229
00:20:16,761 --> 00:20:22,680
That it's not so, it's not so clear which ethic value is above which, so that makes sense.

230
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:24,761
Okay, well, that's that may be Hegel.

231
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:45,400
That would be the issue about whether you subsume, we're in the tragic hero business at that point, which where Hegel and Kierkegaard will get agree that there is a higher principle for Agamemnon, above whether he should kill his daughter or not.

232
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,760
He has to do his duty as king and commander-in-chief.

233
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:56,161
But in general, that it's complicated about Hegel, and you guys shouldn't think about Hegel.

234
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,961
But in Hegel, the ethics is in the everyday way people do things.

235
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:06,160
In German, the word is Zittlichkeit, which is custom.

236
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,000
And like in Pascal's phrase, custom is our nature.

237
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:15,440
And that's, and it's, and Zittlichkeit is lower immediacy.

238
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:22,960
And then it gets, as you're saying, sort of spelled out and mediated into actual ethical principles.

239
00:21:22,961 --> 00:21:30,240
And that's higher than just reacting the way one does in the culture.

240
00:21:30,241 --> 00:21:39,600
But even the ethical principles, I think, express whatever is implicit in the customs of those people.

241
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,521
However, now, but we don't want to go back.

242
00:21:41,521 --> 00:21:44,080
I'm going to get the last word on this because I just don't want to get further into it.

243
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,200
Hegel is enough of a philosopher to think that there are better and worse customs.

244
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:50,801
That's what you're going to say, too.

245
00:21:50,801 --> 00:21:53,281
Yeah, well, Kierkegaard doesn't go into that.

246
00:21:53,281 --> 00:21:56,640
But if he did, now we're back where we started.

247
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,680
It would be one ethical subsuming another ethical.

248
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:12,160
And that's, and Kierkegaard thinks that there is this from the inside of the customs and of any rational way you could explain the custom.

249
00:22:12,801 --> 00:22:29,441
All of that, which is a complicated ethical thing with levels of ethical principles that are higher and lower, all of that can't capture doing something that goes against the ethical principles, the customs, no matter how.

250
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,600
It isn't, I mean, I don't think I should be talking about this because it isn't going to help any.

251
00:22:36,001 --> 00:22:42,361
It isn't as if it's a question, I'll go back to Kierkegaard's way of thinking about it.

252
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:49,080
However, you want to think about it, Hegel can only understand what philosophers can understand.

253
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:59,080
And philosophers can only understand subsuming one ethical principle under another, that there are higher and lower ones.

254
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:04,041
And the best you can, and Abraham is not acting on a higher principle.

255
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:10,441
Abraham is acting on something that you can't express except on the lower principle, namely it's murder.

256
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,480
Agamemnon is operating on a higher principle.

257
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:17,801
And he's not murdering Ephigenia.

258
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:19,240
Let's just remember that.

259
00:23:19,241 --> 00:23:29,801
He's sacrificing Ephigania because the prophet said to do it, and everybody praises him, and he lives happily ever after on Kierkegaard's version.

260
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:37,001
There are other Greek versions in which Clytemnestra never forgives him and kills him in the bathtub when he comes home from the Trojan War.

261
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:42,041
But that's from Kierkegaard's point of view, Agamemnon did it right.

262
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:47,001
He has a suspension of one ethical by another.

263
00:23:47,321 --> 00:23:51,001
But that's not the teleological suspension of the ethical.

264
00:23:51,001 --> 00:24:21,001
The teleological suspension of the ethical is all levels of the ethical are put aside by something which isn't in the ethical because it isn't anything, or put aside by doing something which, if you did put it in the ethical, would be murder, killing Isaac, but which, because it's done in a way which we're going to go to right soon, in a different way, isn't anti-ethical.

265
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:24,440
That it isn't because it's a higher ethical either.

266
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,600
It's what's the magic word going to be?

267
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,641
If it isn't lower immediacy and it isn't mediation, higher immediacy.

268
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,201
That's right.

269
00:24:33,201 --> 00:24:35,041
We've got to explain what that is now.

270
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:41,120
But whatever it is that Abraham's doing, it's higher immediacy, and there's no such thing in Hegel.

271
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,001
There's only just good old-fashioned immediacy.

272
00:24:44,001 --> 00:24:45,041
Now, okay, Chuck.

273
00:24:48,961 --> 00:24:50,561
Why, what can't be defined?

274
00:24:50,961 --> 00:24:55,120
I can't be defined by his commitment to Jim.

275
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,080
Well, that's good.

276
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,880
I mean, you're going to talk me out of what I began with, namely that Huck wasn't a perfect example.

277
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,801
And my podcast informant, the first one, may be right.

278
00:25:06,801 --> 00:25:32,321
If you think that Huck has a commitment to Jim, which he does in some sense, all right, here's the question: Do you think Huck's commitment to Jim is such that Huck defines himself as the lover of Jim, or not homosexual now, but just that Jim is the unconditional thing in Huck's life such that who Huck is is tied up with that?

279
00:25:32,321 --> 00:25:34,721
I was thinking that, I don't know, what do you think?

280
00:25:41,521 --> 00:26:07,241
Okay, well, if you read it his way, if you want to say that Huck is defined by his relation to Jim, so that if he betrays Jim, he betrays himself, and he can't be himself unless he's ready to go against everything rational and ethical for Jim.

281
00:26:07,241 --> 00:26:08,801
Then it works perfectly.

282
00:26:08,961 --> 00:26:09,520
I'm happy.

283
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,960
I want Mark Twain to get it right.

284
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,480
Yeah.

285
00:26:13,801 --> 00:26:14,840
What's that?

286
00:26:10,241 --> 00:26:15,400
Yeah.

287
00:26:15,961 --> 00:26:20,281
This is tied up with the fact that the whole second half of the book is so bad, really.

288
00:26:20,281 --> 00:26:29,400
You know, after this exciting and wonderful beginning, he starts playing these games with Tom Sawyer and Jim, and by the end.

289
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:33,160
So let's just bracket that, how he behaves at the end.

290
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,561
Yeah.

291
00:26:41,321 --> 00:26:42,201
Don't tell anybody.

292
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:43,640
I mean, so two things.

293
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:51,721
When you read Kierkegaard's story about Agamemnon, forget two things.

294
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:57,161
It was my fault to bring up at all what happened afterward with Clytemnestra.

295
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:18,040
The main thing is, don't think that what you learned about tragedy in high school, then namely this Aristotelian thing that Aristotle, the sort of book, movie, or play review that Aristotle wrote about Oedipus and how there you have a tragic flaw and you have to recognize this tragic flaw and then everybody has a catharsis.

296
00:27:18,521 --> 00:27:20,041
A lot of you learned all that.

297
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:22,680
But that's just not how Kierkegaard's thinking about it.

298
00:27:22,681 --> 00:27:26,281
He's thinking about it in a Hegelian model.

299
00:27:26,281 --> 00:27:33,801
He's thinking about it as the kind of suffering required to go from a lower to a higher ethical.

300
00:27:33,801 --> 00:27:37,400
And that's the kind of tragic suffering.

301
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,400
And it leads, you know, you read it.

302
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,680
It's his version.

303
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:46,920
Then it isn't what happened in the Orestea, and then it isn't what happened according to Homer.

304
00:27:48,761 --> 00:27:50,360
It's just another story.

305
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:57,120
The only tragedy it fits, I think, is supposedly Antigone, where there are two conflicting ethics.

306
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:02,080
Bury your brother, support the state, and the tragedy consists in the conflict between.

307
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,001
It's that model.

308
00:28:04,721 --> 00:28:05,041
Yeah.

309
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:08,640
What happens when two different people...

310
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,880
Who's colliding with it?

311
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,041
Yeah, that's right.

312
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:24,960
And okay, and what the Hegelian's going to say, and Kierkegaard's completely in agreement with Hegel as far as Greek tragedy, or this Greek tragedy anyway, is concerned.

313
00:28:24,961 --> 00:28:28,801
Well, the tragedy is that there was a higher ethical than the...

314
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:35,840
It's very lower immediacy for mothers to be totally attached to their daughters and get upset when their daughters are killed.

315
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:45,600
It's a much higher thing and more mediated when kings and commanders in chief do what they promise to do and lead the army the way they're supposed to lead the army.

316
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,440
And Clytemnestra is just wrong.

317
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:53,681
Lower, she just should be, she didn't realize she was trumped by higher ethical.

318
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,160
Yeah.

319
00:28:54,721 --> 00:28:56,880
More on the regional pure graphic.

320
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,400
I hope you guys are good.

321
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,000
And I wonder what would happen if I can and two different.

322
00:29:02,481 --> 00:29:09,281
Yes, there would be suffering, but the suffering wouldn't be unintelligible.

323
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:23,281
Everybody involved would understand that there were these two, I'm just thinking out loud, two ethical claims and what?

324
00:29:23,281 --> 00:29:58,041
I mean, who and within the customs, within the culture, there is an implicit understanding which they all share, which the tragedy makes explicit, that kings trump mothers, and that and there is suffering because it's hard on the Fijian and her mother when the father kills his daughter, but there is an ethical order.

325
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:03,001
And this is not, here's a way to sum it up.

326
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:34,600
This is the teleological suspension of one ethical, namely mothers' daughters, for a higher ethical, namely kings, but it's not a teleological suspension of the ethical, where all forms of ethical, universal, intelligible understanding, is being denied by Abraham, who is nobody, nothing in the culture says murder is all right.

327
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:36,840
Murder just isn't all right.

328
00:30:37,241 --> 00:30:38,600
Here, I'm going to stop, though.

329
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:45,321
It's been fascinating, but we've got to go back to this because you've got to know a lot more about these things.

330
00:30:45,321 --> 00:30:46,360
One last remark.

331
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:57,881
Because at the end of what I say, despite what they just suggested that for Activision of Laws, the higher leadership and a conditional commitment.

332
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:08,920
And I think there's a third way of holding Further Degree, which is that there was a suspension clear, but keep it in mind that he's young, he's a kid, and a lot of ways to teach you the dance of society.

333
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:25,200
And maybe he could express himself, as John was to say, that, you know, despite the efforts, despite how I understand your role in society and your ability to re-wash the beat, that I can suspend that to a higher.

334
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,201
Oh, you blew it, you blew it.

335
00:31:27,201 --> 00:31:28,321
No, no, no.

336
00:31:25,241 --> 00:31:30,400
That's too universal.

337
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:36,321
I mean, as soon as he says that, he's intelligible and he's in the ethical commitment to humans.

338
00:31:36,321 --> 00:31:48,400
No, he would have to say, in spite of the fact that slaves are inferior, in spite of the fact that you shouldn't protect their property, I like Jim so much that I'm going to protect him, and I'm bad.

339
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,561
I'm in lower immediacy.

340
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:57,281
Or he can say, I'm going to protect Jim, and this is dreadful, and I feel terrible for doing it.

341
00:31:57,281 --> 00:31:59,760
I'll never forgive myself for doing it.

342
00:31:59,761 --> 00:32:06,000
However, I'm going to, and I can't understand it, but I have to do it.

343
00:32:06,001 --> 00:32:07,920
Remember, it's unintelligible.

344
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,360
Abraham can't speak.

345
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,080
Remember all that.

346
00:32:10,321 --> 00:32:17,440
There's nothing you said too much to be Abraham or to be Huck if he's suspending the ethical.

347
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,201
Now, I've got to go on, because there's, oh, I can't resist hands.

348
00:32:22,241 --> 00:32:23,361
You've got to help me.

349
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,640
Go ahead.

350
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:25,921
I don't know.

351
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:29,360
I've got friends from the ship.

352
00:32:32,481 --> 00:32:36,961
Well, and what you'd be doing was going down to lower immediacy.

353
00:32:36,961 --> 00:32:46,400
You're making an exception of yourself and your friends because you really feel like it, and you're doing something intelligible, namely wrong.

354
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,160
There are two kinds of intelligible.

355
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,920
I haven't said that clearly enough.

356
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:55,360
There's intelligible as going against the as going with the ethical.

357
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,720
There's intelligible as going against the ethical.

358
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:05,840
When you go against the ethical, it's intelligible as you sinned, in Kierkegaard language, you did a bad thing.

359
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:16,521
As long as Huck just understands himself as having done a bad thing, which you could read it that way, he's not suspending the ethical.

360
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,281
He's sinking beneath the ethical.

361
00:33:18,281 --> 00:33:19,720
I've got to draw a picture.

362
00:33:19,721 --> 00:33:21,480
Ah, piece of chalk.

363
00:33:21,481 --> 00:33:23,321
Okay, I have the picture in here.

364
00:33:23,321 --> 00:33:24,600
I need my picture.

365
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,200
A lot of complicated things in what you're saying.

366
00:33:28,201 --> 00:33:33,561
Okay, so you can go along and follow the universal.

367
00:33:33,561 --> 00:33:36,840
That's what most people do all the time.

368
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:43,880
And now you can, if you're here, you could deviate to lower immediacy.

369
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,080
And the universal is mediation, of course.

370
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,001
And here's lower immediacy.

371
00:33:49,321 --> 00:33:54,601
And now you, and this is temptation.

372
00:33:54,601 --> 00:33:56,120
So what's the temptation?

373
00:33:56,121 --> 00:34:03,721
Once you get used to this vocabulary, you can see that Huck's giving into the temptation, or you with your friends who did bad things and you don't want to turn them in.

374
00:34:03,721 --> 00:34:14,681
The temptation to say, well, I know I should turn them in, but I'm just going to make an exception of myself because I like them a lot and I don't like to hurt people I like.

375
00:34:14,681 --> 00:34:18,201
Then that's temptation and it's sin.

376
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,520
Sin is a funny name for it.

377
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,561
I mean, I would just want to say it's morally wrong.

378
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:29,001
Nothing is important there except sin sounds too necessarily religious.

379
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,880
So, and then if you go down here, what happens?

380
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,121
What do you have to do to make up for it?

381
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,240
Why is your hand up?

382
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,681
Because you're making an exception of yourself and your friends.

383
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,880
And you're not doing what one ought to do.

384
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,600
That's all.

385
00:34:48,601 --> 00:34:54,041
One oughtn't to defend their friends if their friends have done something against the law, say, stealing something.

386
00:34:54,040 --> 00:35:00,721
You can't just say, well, I won't turn them in and I won't tell anybody because I put my friends first.

387
00:35:00,721 --> 00:35:03,520
That's saying, well, that's lower immediacy.

388
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,201
I mean, that's like a child.

389
00:35:05,201 --> 00:35:09,600
I like my friends, and I don't care what you're supposed to do about your friends.

390
00:35:09,601 --> 00:35:11,441
I'm going to do what I like to do.

391
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,321
And then that's down here.

392
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,960
No, no, wait, no, no, no, sorry.

393
00:35:18,321 --> 00:35:24,801
If I don't talk about this enough, you won't understand a lot of what's going on in the third man next on Thursday.

394
00:35:25,601 --> 00:35:29,360
I got a loose, something's wrong with my jeans or something.

395
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,801
I can't resist hands.

396
00:35:30,801 --> 00:35:31,281
Go ahead.

397
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,480
Wait, I couldn't hear people talking.

398
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,200
Talk loud.

399
00:35:44,081 --> 00:35:49,440
Well, in any, I mean, it's always wrong to go against the ethical.

400
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,720
But if you turn, I mean, if you want to save a child, that's a higher ethical.

401
00:35:54,721 --> 00:35:55,360
I mean, that's that.

402
00:35:55,601 --> 00:35:56,961
So, no, it's not wrong.

403
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,080
It's not wrong to go against.

404
00:35:58,161 --> 00:35:58,880
A good point.

405
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,440
I see.

406
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,721
Yes, I have to say this.

407
00:36:00,721 --> 00:36:04,561
Of course, it's not wrong to go against the ethical for a higher ethical.

408
00:36:05,601 --> 00:36:09,280
But her story is making an exception of herself and her friends.

409
00:36:09,281 --> 00:36:13,840
Most people should turn in their friends when they steal things or damage things or something.

410
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,441
But I happen to care so much for my friends that I'm not going to do it.

411
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,840
That's lower immediacy.

412
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:31,121
If you say, I'm not going to turn in my friends because what they were doing was trying to collect money for a worthy cause or something like that.

413
00:36:31,121 --> 00:36:32,960
Then you're just, that's okay.

414
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,080
Then you're doing a higher, you've got to, it's okay.

415
00:36:36,081 --> 00:36:37,281
You haven't sinned.

416
00:36:37,281 --> 00:36:39,041
You haven't gone down here.

417
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,761
But now, now I'm going on.

418
00:36:40,761 --> 00:36:41,321
Sorry.

419
00:36:41,321 --> 00:36:42,681
Oh, okay, okay.

420
00:36:43,641 --> 00:36:44,681
Yeah, yeah.

421
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,041
Kierkegaard's got a very interesting view about it.

422
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:54,201
Very different than, say, Heidegger, who thinks average intelligibility is just conformism.

423
00:36:54,201 --> 00:37:00,521
And the last thing an authentic person would do is give in to the average intelligent ethics.

424
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:11,880
Kierkegaard and Hegel have this deep idea that you've got to have, remember I said, a way of explaining to yourself and other people what you're doing.

425
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:16,681
And therefore, you have to have a sense of what's the right thing to do and what's the wrong thing to do.

426
00:37:16,681 --> 00:37:26,761
And there's no, of course, from Kierkegaard's point of view, particularly, but Hegel sort of, anyway, there's no right answer to this.

427
00:37:26,761 --> 00:37:33,240
All you've got is what everybody in the culture generally agrees on is the right way to behave.

428
00:37:33,241 --> 00:37:35,240
That's where the whole problem starts.

429
00:37:35,241 --> 00:37:45,160
If you could step outside and decide what was rational like Kant, or what was natural, or what was, what else have we got?

430
00:37:45,161 --> 00:37:46,520
God's orders.

431
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:53,561
There are all kinds of ways where you might think that there was some higher thing than what ordinary people just ordinarily think.

432
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:59,801
But if you don't think that, then you've got nothing to go on but what ordinary people think is right and wrong.

433
00:37:59,801 --> 00:38:01,321
You can sharpen it up.

434
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:04,121
You can order it in levels.

435
00:38:04,121 --> 00:38:06,761
You can try to iron out the inconsistencies.

436
00:38:06,761 --> 00:38:16,601
But it's, if people are going to be able to think, they've got to have a shared language of what's worthy and not worthy, what's good and bad, and so forth.

437
00:38:16,601 --> 00:38:19,160
Okay, now I'm surely going to be able to go on.

438
00:38:19,161 --> 00:38:24,681
Let me put my chart on the board because Kierkegaard's got this chart in mind.

439
00:38:24,801 --> 00:38:34,241
If there is another way to deviate from the universal, well, what would it be?

440
00:38:34,241 --> 00:38:45,281
It would be going up here, it would be higher immediacy, and that's what you get when you have faith or when you have an unconditional commitment.

441
00:38:45,601 --> 00:38:55,201
And then, and here, you should do what you have to do to get back to the universal.

442
00:38:55,201 --> 00:39:00,481
And that means you're guilty, and you have to repent, and you have to expiate what you did.

443
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:08,160
Maybe you have to go to prison, maybe you just have to apologize, depending on how dramatic what you did is in breaking away from the universal.

444
00:39:08,161 --> 00:39:17,360
But this is guilt, and this is repent, and this is expiate.

445
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:23,041
Okay, this is what philosophers can understand, according to Kierkegaard.

446
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:42,641
And this is all that Hegel can understand: that there is a universal, that's what it's the shared customs that make things intelligible, that people are always tempted to go and make an exception of themselves, that when they do, they have to go back up here, and people will force them to or put them in prison if need be.

447
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:44,400
But now comes Kierkegaard.

448
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:54,400
And Kierkegaard says, but there is a way of deviating from the universal, which is to be ethical.

449
00:39:54,721 --> 00:39:56,560
Well, I never finished that thought.

450
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,600
Inside the ethical, you have levels of suspending the ethical.

451
00:40:01,601 --> 00:40:08,481
That is, Agamemnon suspends the father loves daughter, for the ethical king does his job.

452
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:17,241
But then Kierkegaard has the idea that you could suspend the whole ethical, not just some ethical by some higher ethical.

453
00:40:17,241 --> 00:40:22,681
But here's some place where you suspend the ethical altogether.

454
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:32,360
Abraham killing Isaac, for instance, but also homosexuals in Denmark and Huck saving Jim.

455
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,241
And what about them?

456
00:40:37,321 --> 00:40:38,761
What is this?

457
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,321
What's the name of it, and what's the phenomena, according to Kierkegaard?

458
00:40:43,321 --> 00:40:52,041
If you've been doing this reading, which is pretty difficult, but not very much, reading it over and over, tell me the name of that arrow.

459
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,640
What's the temptation in that?

460
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:02,521
If you're up here, say gay in 1850 Copenhagen, what's the temptation?

461
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:07,961
To go to the universal, to go straight, to get married and have kids and so forth.

462
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,720
That's the temptation.

463
00:41:10,121 --> 00:41:15,161
That is, and his word for this is a trial.

464
00:41:15,161 --> 00:41:18,681
Abraham, what Abraham is going through is a trial.

465
00:41:20,601 --> 00:41:29,001
That doesn't mean that it's something that he's aware of and it's a test, although it is sort of like that.

466
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,680
But think about the phenomena.

467
00:41:30,681 --> 00:41:31,960
What's the phenomena?

468
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:46,601
Whenever somebody would be gay in a time when all they could say to themselves was, this is perverted, this is depraved, this is disgusting, and so forth, then the big temptation is to go back to the ethical.

469
00:41:46,601 --> 00:42:01,680
And that pull toward the ethical is a trial, and we need some word which Kierkegaard doesn't have, that the ethical, here's lower immediacy, here's the ethical.

470
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,920
Both of them have a kind of pull.

471
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,441
The lower immediacy pulls you away from the universal.

472
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,041
The trial pulls you away from higher immediacy toward the universal.

473
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,840
I'm going to call them, they're both a kind of attraction to deviate.

474
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,360
So the attraction here is to deviate from your calling.

475
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,281
Let's call this the calling.

476
00:42:23,281 --> 00:42:26,961
So here's the attraction to go back to the universal.

477
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:35,521
The attraction here is to deviate from the universal to making an exception of yourself, to the immediate, and that's the attraction.

478
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:42,321
And just to show you a place where he talks about it, he talks about being a trial on 137.

479
00:42:42,321 --> 00:42:44,481
I've got to get back to the book.

480
00:42:45,761 --> 00:42:52,241
That is beyond where your reading is, but that's a good definition of a trial at the bottom of 137.

481
00:42:52,641 --> 00:42:55,681
He would have to sacrifice Isaac because it was a trial.

482
00:42:55,681 --> 00:42:57,040
Oh, well, that doesn't explain it.

483
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,400
He uses the word there.

484
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:04,401
There are other places where I'll come across them when I do my lecture in the normal order.

485
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,761
Well, lots to cover.

486
00:43:05,761 --> 00:43:07,440
Let me go back and see where we are.

487
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,321
Ah, but here's a whole big bunch of things to talk about.

488
00:43:10,641 --> 00:43:20,880
But let's just read one place where, what's the bottom line of all we've been talking about, is that philosophers have only this picture down here.

489
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:28,160
Therefore, philosophers have no way of distinguish acting on one's calling from sinning.

490
00:43:28,161 --> 00:43:36,000
And that's what you get on 84 in this wonderfully complicated way of saying something which is pretty complicated.

491
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:43,001
On 84, I'm going to read this because I'll see if you can tell me if you can explain it.

492
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:45,400
For faith is just this paradox.

493
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:54,600
You see at the first paragraph on 84, that the single individual is higher than the universal, though in such a way be it noted that the movement is repeated.

494
00:43:54,601 --> 00:44:02,601
That is, that having been in the universal, the particular, you have to keep rewriting it because the translation doesn't know what's going on.

495
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:08,441
The particular now sets himself apart from the universal.

496
00:44:08,761 --> 00:44:09,560
No, sorry.

497
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:14,921
Sets himself apart as the individual above the universal.

498
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:25,721
If that is not faith, then Abraham is done for, and faith has never existed in the world just because it has always existed.

499
00:44:25,721 --> 00:44:27,321
Do you understand that?

500
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,640
See if anybody could decipher that.

501
00:44:29,641 --> 00:44:30,761
Good, yeah?

502
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:39,001
I think that what it's saying is that if faith is the universal, then it goes rational.

503
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,560
Well, you've got the form of the answer, but what you're saying is dead wrong, unfortunately.

504
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,080
You may have misspoken.

505
00:44:45,081 --> 00:44:47,081
It's not about the universal.

506
00:44:47,081 --> 00:44:49,081
It's about now faith.

507
00:44:49,081 --> 00:45:00,521
If faith has been the deviation from being an individual to being a particular, and then at particular, yeah, you want to say something?

508
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,241
Sure.

509
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:01,801
Go ahead.

510
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:02,840
No, go ahead.

511
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,681
And there's extension principles to people.

512
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,480
And so he said, well, it's not a divisional calling.

513
00:45:12,281 --> 00:45:13,801
That's well put.

514
00:45:13,801 --> 00:45:14,681
Well put.

515
00:45:14,681 --> 00:45:18,521
Faith has never existed because it has always existed.

516
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:25,121
That is, the only thing, the only way to deviate from the universal is toward lower immediacy.

517
00:45:25,121 --> 00:45:27,360
And faith is just like superstition.

518
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:29,520
Remember I said last time, that's just another form of lower immediacy.

519
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:36,961
And faith has always existed because lower immediacy has always existed and superstition and so forth.

520
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:46,961
So there's no place to understand Abraham because all you can say about Abraham is, well, he's going crazy or something.

521
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,520
That's all the table can account for.

522
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,400
That's the story.

523
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,321
You're looking puzzled by your own remarks.

524
00:45:54,801 --> 00:45:55,440
Oh, okay.

525
00:45:55,681 --> 00:46:02,161
I feel like with the faith and the calling, you know, if you look at the two calling.

526
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,201
Yeah.

527
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:04,801
Yeah.

528
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:06,961
Right.

529
00:46:07,121 --> 00:46:14,640
The distinction made on the calling itself divided on this other symbolic or okay.

530
00:46:14,641 --> 00:46:23,921
Well, I well, that's that's, I mean, if you want my personal opinion, that's the kind of jargon that you get in English departments.

531
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,080
I don't have any objection to it.

532
00:46:26,081 --> 00:46:29,201
I just want to say that are you from the English department?

533
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:32,000
That's what happens when you're a podcast.

534
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,920
Now, look, I'm all over the world.

535
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:43,521
They know that I think that this kind of jargon is, I'm not sure it's nonsense, but what I want to say about it is it misses the phenomenon.

536
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,640
You see, you're going to say that?

537
00:46:44,641 --> 00:46:52,880
I mean, the idea isn't the symmetry here, and yes, this is related to the universal, and this is a kind of semiotic bunch of relations.

538
00:46:52,880 --> 00:47:02,001
This is something that you feel when you've got romantic love, and this is something you feel when you're making an exception of yourself to go in for some desire.

539
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:10,201
And either that phenomenological distinction is true about our experience, at least in the West, or it isn't.

540
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:16,281
And it covers it up to talk about it too formally, if you're a phenomenology person like I am.

541
00:47:16,601 --> 00:47:19,480
So let me go on because time is so short.

542
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,321
And I'm now, where am I?

543
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:38,201
Okay, so now we understand that faith has always existed because it's never existed, because it gets lumped down here with superstition and desire and moods and stuff, and there's no place for something up here because philosophy doesn't have that.

544
00:47:38,201 --> 00:47:41,160
So let me go on the rest of the paragraph.

545
00:47:41,161 --> 00:47:46,921
For if the ethical life is the highest, you see, that's what happens if you cut this piece off.

546
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:56,600
If the ethical life is the highest and nothing incommensurable is left over in man, except the sense of what is evil, another word for down here.

547
00:47:56,601 --> 00:47:58,121
Now we've got evil.

548
00:47:58,121 --> 00:47:59,801
Well, this sounds still too religious.

549
00:48:00,281 --> 00:48:03,641
You don't need evil, but we'll put it on here anyway.

550
00:48:03,641 --> 00:48:04,601
It's okay.

551
00:48:04,601 --> 00:48:10,761
So, yeah, that is, now they go on.

552
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,800
What's left over is what is evil.

553
00:48:13,801 --> 00:48:19,001
That is, the particular who is to be expressed in the universal.

554
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:25,721
Then one needs no other categories than those of the Greek philosophers or whatever can be logically deduced from them.

555
00:48:25,721 --> 00:48:30,681
This is something Hegel, who has after all made some study of the Greeks, ought not to kept quiet about.

556
00:48:30,681 --> 00:48:33,401
That is, Hegel can't understand Abraham.

557
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:42,441
There's no place in Greek philosophy for unconditional commitments and all the important issues and callings due to this picture.

558
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:49,801
If you throw the Judeo-Christians against the Greeks, then you get this complicated picture.

559
00:48:50,121 --> 00:49:15,681
Now, I want to switch to something else you need to know, and that is about how do you tell whether somebody's suspending the ethical in the higher way, here, suspending the whole ethical and doing their calling, and here, somebody's deviating from the ethical and going in to satisfy their lower immediate impulses.

560
00:49:15,681 --> 00:49:27,201
Well, I'm going to go through a whole bunch of different ones because you have to keep your eye open in the movie to see where, who is deviating in what way.

561
00:49:28,081 --> 00:49:31,040
The whole movie is about deviating from the ethical.

562
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,880
So, here's some examples.

563
00:49:33,201 --> 00:49:52,241
So, there's one way that we need, as Kierkegaard says, some criteria in order to be able to sort out the difference between people acting for lower immediacy or just crazy and people suspending the ethical.

564
00:49:52,241 --> 00:49:59,120
On 106, he talks about needing the criteria in the bottom paragraph.

565
00:50:00,641 --> 00:50:08,801
It's possible on the basis of a paradox to construct certain criteria which even someone not in it can understand.

566
00:50:08,801 --> 00:50:12,641
Now, I'm going to tell you three criteria.

567
00:50:12,641 --> 00:50:15,680
And they're running around in the book.

568
00:50:16,081 --> 00:50:18,401
Maybe I'll define them, and maybe I won't.

569
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:28,960
So, first, there is one thing you have to see before somebody could possibly be a knight of faith suspending the ethical, is that they're free.

570
00:50:29,281 --> 00:50:30,480
And what would it be?

571
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,121
Otherwise, it would be a compulsion.

572
00:50:33,121 --> 00:50:44,680
I mean, if, as Jack Nicholson in The Shining is out to, having read too much, Kierkegaard is out to kill his son, it's not as if he's doing it freely.

573
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,601
He's just crazy, and he's compelled to do it.

574
00:50:48,601 --> 00:50:54,680
The most perfect example is Peter Laurie in M.

575
00:50:54,681 --> 00:51:03,401
How many of you take out M and watch it if you want to understand the extremist version, a deviation from the ethical.

576
00:51:03,721 --> 00:51:13,641
Peter Laurie in M is an irresistible, he's a man who has an irresistible compulsion to kill little girls.

577
00:51:13,641 --> 00:51:18,761
And whenever he sees a nice little girl going by eating an ice cream cone or something, he tries not to.

578
00:51:18,761 --> 00:51:26,041
He goes to a cafe, he orders brandy, he tries to read the newspaper, but pretty soon he just can't resist that he kills a little girl.

579
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:33,880
And he feels very sorry for himself because it isn't even as if he's freely choosing to do this.

580
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,640
He just can't resist.

581
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:42,281
And that kind of compulsion that you can't resist isn't even in this business.

582
00:51:42,761 --> 00:51:51,480
You just see that to see somebody who is definitely not a knight of faith suspending the ethical because they're not doing anything.

583
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,520
They're not free.

584
00:51:52,681 --> 00:51:57,001
At the top of 139, again, I'm sorry, a little outside your reading.

585
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,481
Abraham can refrain at any moment.

586
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,360
He can repent the whole thing as a temptation.

587
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:13,160
Well, Peter Laurie in M can't refrain at any moment, and he can't think of the whole thing as a temptation because he can't help it.

588
00:52:13,161 --> 00:52:14,441
He just does it.

589
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:17,241
Now, it's very hard to hear the difference.

590
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,761
You've got to get used to this.

591
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:37,040
When Luther stands in front of the church in 15-something and defies the whole Catholic Church, who Luther has clearly got an unconditional commitment, and he's clearly going against the whole intelligibility of medieval times, it's no coincidence that Kierkegaard is a Lutheran.

592
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:41,761
Then Luther famously said, Here I stand, I can do no other.

593
00:52:42,081 --> 00:52:47,521
Now, Peter Laurie also said, I mean, here I go, killing little girls, I can do no other.

594
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:57,041
But the difference is that the psychopath literally can't do any other because he's got this compulsion.

595
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,360
Whereas Luther doesn't mean I'm compelled to stand up against the Catholic Church.

596
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,880
Boy, I wish I didn't have to do this.

597
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,641
It's very painful to everybody concerned that I can't resist.

598
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:16,161
No, he means I have to, because of my unconditional commitment, whatever it is, because to be Luther, I have to do it.

599
00:53:16,721 --> 00:53:18,001
But that's the first thing.

600
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:24,640
The knight of faith suspending the ethical has got to be free.

601
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,321
It's not a compulsion.

602
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,801
Now, then what is it?

603
00:53:32,801 --> 00:53:39,920
Well, Kierkegaard's going to give you two negative criteria and one positive one for how to recognize the...

604
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:49,760
So if you want to recognize there are two things that if they, if somebody shows these two things, they can't be a knight of faith, suspending the ethical.

605
00:53:49,761 --> 00:53:50,961
What would they be?

606
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:58,240
Well, the first and most important is, see if I can put it so you can see it, guess it.

607
00:53:59,201 --> 00:54:01,921
Well, it's built into this.

608
00:54:03,201 --> 00:54:07,281
If you're suspending the ethical, you're here.

609
00:54:07,601 --> 00:54:11,161
If you're not suspending the ethical, you're here.

610
00:54:11,161 --> 00:54:13,240
How do you know where you are?

611
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,041
It's sort of in the picture.

612
00:54:10,161 --> 00:54:16,200
Yeah.

613
00:54:17,161 --> 00:54:18,920
You could explain what you were doing and so on.

614
00:54:19,081 --> 00:54:22,040
Yeah, well, yeah, you're on the right track.

615
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:22,440
Right.

616
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,601
So you've got to go through mediation.

617
00:54:26,601 --> 00:54:28,601
But now, what does it mean in this case?

618
00:54:28,601 --> 00:54:33,880
Well, it means that the knight of, you'll recognize it when I tell it to you this way.

619
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:38,281
The knight of faith suspending the ethical respects the ethical.

620
00:54:38,601 --> 00:54:41,241
Otherwise, there wouldn't be any problem.

621
00:54:41,241 --> 00:54:48,761
I mean, Abraham's got a problem because he doesn't want to murder Isaac and so forth.

622
00:54:48,761 --> 00:54:58,681
So it's just because the knight of faith does respect the ethical, that the ethical is at trial and is pulling him down here.

623
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:02,600
And it isn't right to respect the ethical.

624
00:55:02,601 --> 00:55:11,880
It's not a good idea to go around going against the established ethics of the time, which is the only ethics you've got.

625
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:17,161
So he has total respect for the universal.

626
00:55:17,161 --> 00:55:20,600
Otherwise, Kierkegaard calls that he would be a vagrant genius.

627
00:55:20,601 --> 00:55:27,241
That is, somebody who thinks they're so smart, so special, that they can do anything.

628
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:30,600
Now, you all, I mean, I don't know if I can get you to thinker.

629
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,440
Who do you know from your reading?

630
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:40,920
Lots of you, who thinks that he's so smart and so superior that he can just go against the ethical and kill somebody without even feeling bad about it.

631
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,840
Does that sound familiar?

632
00:55:43,801 --> 00:55:44,440
Yes.

633
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,481
Who said that?

634
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,680
You win something.

635
00:55:46,681 --> 00:55:47,241
Okay.

636
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,280
What?

637
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,281
Did I?

638
00:55:50,601 --> 00:55:51,641
Did I say?

639
00:55:52,281 --> 00:55:53,321
Ah, yeah, well, that's right.

640
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:56,000
There was something to be said for being, according to English guys.

641
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,161
He says, for Koen.

642
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:07,840
So, yeah, Raskolnikov says that he's the superior person, so he can kill the old pawnbroker because he will do better things with her money than she would do with her money.

643
00:56:08,161 --> 00:56:10,880
So Raskolnikov isn't suspending the ethical.

644
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,880
He's just ignoring the ethical.

645
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:13,681
Forget it, friend.

646
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:14,560
What's he doing?

647
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,161
Making an exception of himself.

648
00:56:16,161 --> 00:56:17,760
I'm Raskolnikov.

649
00:56:17,761 --> 00:56:23,681
I can go down here and do what makes me happy and fills my satisfies my desires.

650
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:26,561
So we look at him and we say, he's not.

651
00:56:26,721 --> 00:56:28,080
And I think I had another list.

652
00:56:28,081 --> 00:56:31,840
Charles Manson is certainly not respecting the ethical.

653
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,880
And it's hard to know about Hitler, but it always comes up.

654
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:40,400
Isn't Kierkegaard saying that Hitler might be a knight of faith suspending the ethical?

655
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,440
None of you asked me.

656
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,240
Either, I don't know whether that shows you're understanding it better or less.

657
00:56:46,241 --> 00:56:56,880
But anyway, it's true, Kierkegaard, sorry, yeah, it's true, Kierkegaard wouldn't have a problem about Hitler because Hitler doesn't respect the ethical.

658
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,721
I mean, Hitler thinks killing Jews is just fine.

659
00:57:01,601 --> 00:57:03,920
And so that's the first criteria.

660
00:57:04,641 --> 00:57:11,441
If the character in question, look at me, Puck Finn respects the ethical.

661
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,041
That's why he's trembling when he's tearing up the letter.

662
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:21,441
The gay person in 1850 Copenhagen respects the ethical.

663
00:57:22,241 --> 00:57:24,880
And then they go up here and do what they do anyway.

664
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:31,440
But they do it in, you know, all in upset.

665
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,001
Yeah.

666
00:57:32,321 --> 00:57:33,121
Oh, okay.

667
00:57:33,121 --> 00:57:43,400
I mean that they think that the ethical is right and that they should obey it and that that's that they'd have no, they know do not remember they're inside their culture.

668
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,761
They aren't in Berkeley.

669
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:49,481
They think from where they are that it's bad to be homosexual.

670
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:55,480
They think from where they are that it's bad to protect a runaway slave and so forth.

671
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:03,081
I mean by that, that they that they see that the ethical has authority over them and then they go against it.

672
00:58:03,081 --> 00:58:04,521
Okay, that's number one.

673
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,480
What's number two?

674
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:08,840
Well, that's sort of more surprising.

675
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:17,880
The other thing that you could be sure, if this is a person is, these remember negative criteria that you can see from the outside.

676
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:24,121
You can see from the outside that Hitler and Raskolnikov are not knights of faith suspending the ethical.

677
00:58:24,121 --> 00:58:33,080
The other thing you can see from the outside is if the person claims to have a new ethics, they're not a knight of faith, the suspender of the ethical.

678
00:58:33,081 --> 00:58:43,001
So he says at the bottom of 106, the true knight of faith, about 10 lines from the bottom, is always in absolute isolation.

679
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
There's an in there's a typo there.

680
00:58:45,161 --> 00:58:47,241
There should be an in, at least in my copy.

681
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,200
Still missing an in in your copy here?

682
00:58:50,201 --> 00:58:51,080
I've got an older one.

683
00:58:51,081 --> 00:58:51,960
It's still okay.

684
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,401
The true knight of faith is always in absolute isolation.

685
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,040
The false knight is sectarian.

686
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:04,520
That is, the false knight has, you know, a new ethics to propose.

687
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:08,921
Or across from that on the next page, the true knight of faith is a witness, never a teacher.

688
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:16,360
That is, the true knight of faith will sacrifice for their unconditional commitment that they believe in, but they've got no principles.

689
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:20,200
They're not saying everybody should love Beatrice.

690
00:59:20,201 --> 00:59:24,440
They're not turning their commitment into a cult or something.

691
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:31,441
So, if so, that's the second one: that if you see somebody who's, and now we could put Hitler there, that's what's interesting.

692
00:59:31,440 --> 01:00:11,921
If Hitler thinks that he can justify what he's doing by proposing a new ethical, namely that the Aryans are superior to the Jews, the Germans are the superior countries that are going to save the West, some of the Nazi jargon is like that, then you can see that he's still not a knight of faith because he's now not a knight of faith suspending the ethical because he's claiming that he's got a higher, when he kills the Jews, he's claiming he's doing it on the basis of a higher ethical that any intelligent German can understand, that Jews are subhuman and they're bad for the culture, and they're like sort of undermining everything, so you've got to kill them.

693
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:16,561
So, again, that's not suspending the ethical.

694
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:21,520
And both of those lead up to the really important criterion.

695
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,041
There's one more.

696
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:34,641
This one is a tricky one, though, because it's not how you can tell from the outside whether this person is suspending the ethical, but whether they can tell from the inside.

697
01:00:34,641 --> 01:00:36,321
What would that be?

698
01:00:37,281 --> 01:00:43,441
Well, remember what happens to Chuck when he decides to tear up the letter?

699
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,561
Yep.

700
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,280
Yes, that's right.

701
01:00:47,281 --> 01:00:50,321
He's trembling, which is the anguish story.

702
01:00:50,321 --> 01:01:05,681
Yes, if you're feeling anguish, that is, if you're feeling that this is a terrible thing you're doing, and when you try to talk to yourself, you say, I'm a murderer, or I'm a pervert, or I'm a slave protector, or whatever.

703
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:16,520
And you're trembling, then you know, then that doesn't, I think, prove that, you know, there may be something else wrong with you.

704
01:01:16,601 --> 01:01:19,001
Maybe you've got malaria and you're trembling or something.

705
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:28,600
But I mean, but if you're trembling because you're contemplating this tension, then you know that you are suspending the ethical.

706
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:34,041
Now, I've got a whole bunch of quotes that say things like that, so let me get to them.

707
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:39,560
On 60, no, I don't think, well, anguish, middle of that top paragraph.

708
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:43,801
The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he was willing to murder Isaac.

709
01:01:43,801 --> 01:01:47,721
The religious expression is that he was willing to sacrifice Isaac.

710
01:01:47,721 --> 01:01:54,041
But in this contradiction lies the very anguish that can indeed make one sleepless and so forth.

711
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:56,441
So let's try that.

712
01:01:56,761 --> 01:02:07,800
I'm wondering whether Kierkegaard is being consistent there, whether sacrifice, he's got to assume that sacrifice is not a sort of normal ethical term.

713
01:02:07,801 --> 01:02:23,721
Abraham can't say to Sarah, I'm going to sacrifice Isaac, the way Agamemnon can say to Clytemnestra, I've got to sacrifice Ephijaniah, because it's clear that when you sacrifice Ephijaniah, you do it because you have a higher ethical duty, namely king.

714
01:02:23,721 --> 01:02:29,401
But Abraham isn't sacrificing Isaac to some higher ethical, and that's what's important.

715
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:47,801
So it turns out that if he says it's a sacrifice, it's still unintelligible because it isn't a kind of tragic sacrifice, which is the only kind of sacrifice that's intelligent.

716
01:02:49,081 --> 01:02:55,321
It isn't as if there's some higher ethical that he's sacrificing Isaac to, that he could explain to himself or anybody else.

717
01:02:56,721 --> 01:02:58,160
Okay, let's look at some more.

718
01:02:58,161 --> 01:03:01,201
On 95, the topic.

719
01:03:01,201 --> 01:03:03,281
I don't see anything about anguish there.

720
01:03:03,281 --> 01:03:04,561
Let me think a minute.

721
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,321
No, that's not going to help any.

722
01:03:06,321 --> 01:03:08,561
So let's go on to 89.

723
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,080
On 89.

724
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,280
Well, that's just important.

725
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:20,561
That's the main paragraph to mark where it says Abraham can't be mediated, that he can't speak.

726
01:03:21,121 --> 01:03:29,041
That for him, the situation is a temptation, namely a temptation to return to the universal, and so forth.

727
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:33,520
But I've got to find the one that says anguish is the criterion.

728
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,441
I thought I had marked it.

729
01:03:35,761 --> 01:03:37,681
Oh, I'm reading in the wrong place.

730
01:03:37,681 --> 01:03:38,241
Here we go.

731
01:03:38,241 --> 01:03:39,040
Try again.

732
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,481
106.

733
01:03:41,761 --> 01:03:48,480
Well, about 10 lines down, the tragic hero acts and finds his point of rest in the universal.

734
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,520
That's Agamemnon.

735
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,481
The knight of faith is kept in constant tension.

736
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,120
That's that I'm looking for.

737
01:03:55,121 --> 01:03:58,241
There's a place where he says anguish is the criterion.

738
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,560
Until I find it, I have to keep looking.

739
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:01,921
102.

740
01:04:02,241 --> 01:04:07,360
Those are all relevant quotes, the clincher quote.

741
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:17,840
No, there's another one near the bottom of 102, which says, no person who has learned that to exist as the individual is the most terrifying thing of all will be afraid of saying it's the greatest.

742
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:20,961
Why is it the most terrifying thing of all to be an individual?

743
01:04:21,121 --> 01:04:21,761
Wait a second.

744
01:04:21,761 --> 01:04:22,161
Let me just.

745
01:04:22,321 --> 01:04:22,960
You got that?

746
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:31,441
Because it might sound like, after all, there are all these people who love other people and who commit themselves to good causes and so forth.

747
01:04:31,681 --> 01:04:32,801
Never mind, good causes.

748
01:04:32,801 --> 01:04:33,921
That makes it ethical.

749
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:39,201
Commit themselves to a cause that they don't understand, but they feel they have to do it.

750
01:04:39,201 --> 01:04:41,480
Why is that terrifying?

751
01:04:41,801 --> 01:04:46,041
Well, the answer is something like: it doesn't have to be terrifying.

752
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:52,360
But all it means is that there's a higher authority in your life that may require you to go against the ethical.

753
01:04:52,360 --> 01:05:06,041
But if you've got enough imagination to see that once you've got an unconditional commitment, you could be called any time to go against the ethical, that's already terrifying.

754
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:24,761
It's the equivalent of seeing the sword hanging over the head of the beloved, which you, when you, that is, you don't have to all the time think that your beloved is about to die, but if you've got any imagination, you realize it could happen anytime, and yet you get more involved.

755
01:05:24,761 --> 01:05:36,201
And Abraham, or anyone suspending the ethical, realizes that they could at any time be called to go against the ethical, and yet they get more, yet they go on doing it.

756
01:05:36,201 --> 01:05:37,480
Yeah, I see a hand way back there.

757
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:38,601
What is it?

758
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:39,560
I hope not.

759
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:45,081
Yeah, Agamemnon does, but why Abraham?

760
01:05:45,321 --> 01:05:54,201
In the Today of Hypton file, I thought important thoughts that James wasn't comfortable.

761
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,401
Good.

762
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:59,001
Yeah, somebody has to say that, and I'm glad you said that.

763
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:26,880
But you've got to see that Kierkegaard performed a kind of move on that, where, think of it this way: if God had a way of saying so that everybody could understand it intelligible, I've just, right with skywriting over the Israelis, the Israelites, if I've just commanded Abraham to kill his son, and it's all right, because I just did, then it would look ethical.

764
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:29,600
And P.S., you always ought to do what I command.

765
01:06:29,761 --> 01:06:35,761
If God had said all that, then it would have become ethical.

766
01:06:35,761 --> 01:06:43,121
But of course, Kierkegaard sees it as if, well, what is this thing about sacrificing Isaac, this command?

767
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:46,720
It doesn't really, this is where the God gets sort of confusing.

768
01:06:47,681 --> 01:07:00,161
All he has of God in there is there is an unconditional commitment, and there is a calling, and this calling is calling Abraham to go against the ethical.

769
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:14,081
And he just turns the sacrifice of Isaac into something unintelligible because there's no way, it's not just that there's no way to tell whether Abraham is sacrificing.

770
01:07:14,081 --> 01:07:26,161
There's no way to even express it because there's no way for God to turn it into, according to Kierkegaard, some universal thing like always obey God.

771
01:07:26,161 --> 01:07:28,240
That's what the philosophers will do to it.

772
01:07:28,241 --> 01:07:29,920
That's what Augustine does to it.

773
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,720
Augustine says the Abraham-Isaac story is ethical.

774
01:07:32,721 --> 01:07:35,681
It shows you should always do what God commands you to do.

775
01:07:35,681 --> 01:07:38,480
But Kierkegaard says, that's, wait a minute.

776
01:07:40,321 --> 01:07:41,440
What does this look like?

777
01:07:42,641 --> 01:07:43,840
How can I make sense of it?

778
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:44,080
Yeah.

779
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:55,280
Well, you were just where I was sort of about an hour ago.

780
01:07:55,681 --> 01:07:56,400
You're right.

781
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:58,800
You can't make sense of it.

782
01:07:59,201 --> 01:08:00,880
Just don't let it mess you up.

783
01:08:00,881 --> 01:08:13,560
I mean, don't let your own reading of the Abraham story as God saying to Abraham, I want you to do this because I ask you to do it and you ought to obey me.

784
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:16,520
Don't turn it into that kind of story.

785
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,121
That makes it intelligible.

786
01:08:18,121 --> 01:08:19,480
That makes it ethical.

787
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:22,281
Ask yourself how Sarah is going to take it.

788
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:26,840
If Abraham can say to Sarah, I'm very sorry about this.

789
01:08:26,841 --> 01:08:30,840
You can't imagine how upset I am, but I'm called to do it.

790
01:08:30,841 --> 01:08:34,041
And Sarah understands it and says, I admire you.

791
01:08:34,041 --> 01:08:37,880
You're a really God-obeying person, and this is terrible.

792
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:46,760
We waited until we were 90 to have this kid, and now you're going to kill our child, but I forgive you or something, then you've made it all intelligible.

793
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:53,960
But you've got to realize that Abraham could only say to Sarah, I'm setting out to murder Isaac, the way Kierkegaard sets it up.

794
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:58,680
It doesn't add anything to say, I'm setting out to sacrifice Isaac.

795
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:10,520
Because the way Kierkegaard sets it up, that's not something intelligible that anybody could do, that a father could go out to kill their son as just as something God commanded.

796
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,760
So just don't worry about it.

797
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:17,640
Consider all the phenomena, not the Bible story.

798
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:18,281
Let me see.

799
01:09:18,281 --> 01:09:19,241
I got three more minutes.

800
01:09:19,241 --> 01:09:20,760
I got to see where we are.

801
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,960
I'm looking for the anguish, and I haven't found it yet.

802
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:25,960
How about 137?

803
01:09:25,961 --> 01:09:27,400
Let's try that.

804
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:28,600
Ah, there we go.

805
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,760
Two-thirds of the way down.

806
01:09:31,081 --> 01:09:39,000
For distress and anguish are the only justification conceivable, even though they cannot be conceived in general.

807
01:09:39,321 --> 01:09:42,040
Abraham is silent because he cannot speak.

808
01:09:42,041 --> 01:09:44,520
Therein lies the distress and anguish.

809
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:51,241
For when I speak, when I, for if I speak, if he speaks, he cannot make himself understood.

810
01:09:51,241 --> 01:09:57,121
And then at the bottom, it's a trial.

811
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:58,800
That is, we're back to that again.

812
01:09:59,041 --> 01:10:04,161
I mean, there is this temptation, this attraction to explain it, but he can't explain it.

813
01:10:04,161 --> 01:10:07,680
Okay, so anguish turns out to be, how did it go?

814
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:10,241
The only justification.

815
01:10:10,241 --> 01:10:12,640
It's a funny kind of justification.

816
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,760
It just, it's, what do you get for your justification now?

817
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:16,800
Let's put it together.

818
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:25,281
You have to be, to be a knight of faith, suspending the ethical, you have to be free, not compelled.

819
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:36,480
You have to believe it, you have to go through mediation and believe in mediation and understand the value and the authority of the ethical.

820
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:40,161
And then you have to do this, and you don't feel good about it.

821
01:10:40,161 --> 01:10:45,360
You have to feel anguish and dread about it because it's telling you to go against that.

822
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:48,000
And you feel the pull to go back.

823
01:10:48,321 --> 01:10:50,480
Then you've got the whole picture.

824
01:10:50,480 --> 01:11:07,121
And you can ask yourself now whether anybody in the movie, Thursday, fulfills the condition of being a knight of faith, and whether anybody in the movie fulfills the condition of living in the ethical.

825
01:11:07,121 --> 01:11:08,081
Those are the categories.

826
01:11:08,081 --> 01:11:10,640
Now, don't think in terms of defining commitments.

827
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:18,241
There is defining commitment in the movie, but you've got to see it now in the light of the issue of the suspension of the ethical.

828
01:11:18,241 --> 01:11:18,640
Okay.
