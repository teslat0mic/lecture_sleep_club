1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,001
Now we're off.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,080
Okay, I like to begin, as I did in the last two movies, with some kind of puzzle at the beginning and try to figure you have to then try in the end, like in Hiroshima, to understand whether she saw anything or didn't, understood anything or didn't.

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,160
And in the next one, it's whether Harry Lyme is dead or isn't.

4
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:25,360
Well, here, the end of the movie is obviously completely puzzling.

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,560
Michelle does call Patricia degulas, which gets translated scumbag, which is ridiculous.

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,200
It should be translated revolting or disgusting.

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,640
And he doesn't say she is.

8
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:39,840
We'll get to that at the end.

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,880
He says it is disgusting.

10
00:00:42,881 --> 00:00:46,160
And the question is, what is he talking about?

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,321
It's like his last words.

12
00:00:48,321 --> 00:01:01,360
It seems that it must be that it's because she turned him in to the police that she's disgusting, which would make perfect sense, but not the kind of sense that would make any sense in this movie.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:19,161
Because he gives her the final friendly secret grimaces, making him, he makes these three funny faces at her, which is certainly not what he would be doing if he was angry at her for turning him in.

14
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:28,200
But he does say that something's disgusting, so we have a whole movie to go through before the end of the time to figure out what happens in the end.

15
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,041
It happens pretty fast, and the first few times you see it, at least I saw it, I didn't get it.

16
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:37,401
Okay, so we have to start with Michelle Poichard.

17
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:41,880
We're going to talk about each of the main characters, each one for quite a while.

18
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:43,321
Of course, feel free to interrupt.

19
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:52,520
I'm always interested in, you're all of a kind of video generation that see things faster than I do, and faster maybe than Godard did.

20
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,721
So if you see things that I missed, just tell me.

21
00:01:55,721 --> 00:02:17,160
Okay, to begin with, Michelle seems very attractive, but that's odd because he's just a punk who kills a policeman, steals cars, worst of the either, as far as the movie's concerned, steals money from his ex-girlfriend because she's so trusting that she shows him where her money is, offering him to loan him some.

22
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:25,161
And as you remember, then when she's putting on her dress, he just steals her money, and then he invites her out to breakfast on her stolen money.

23
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:29,080
That's all pretty disgusting, one would think.

24
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,200
So why is he so attractive through the whole movie?

25
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,960
This is Belmondo's first movie.

26
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:35,321
He was a boxer before.

27
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,000
That's what he says at one point in the movie.

28
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,041
He may not be good looking, but he's a good boxer, he says.

29
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:44,441
Well, what he has is a kind of style.

30
00:02:44,441 --> 00:02:50,681
He's the kind of thing that Nietzsche would admire and that he admires, presumably in bogey.

31
00:02:50,680 --> 00:03:01,280
But he, Michelle Poicard, does everything he does with a kind of flair, openness, cheerfulness, spontaneity, intensity.

32
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,601
That's all a pretty attractive way to act.

33
00:03:05,601 --> 00:03:11,120
And his way of putting it is when he's driving the stolen car, never use the brakes.

34
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,360
And behind him at one moment, a poster says, live dangerously to the end.

35
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,841
It doesn't get translated in the subtitles.

36
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:28,560
They're busy translating the marquee of the movie theater, which doesn't matter, instead of translating the poster, which is what definitely matters, that it's there.

37
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,481
And in the scenario, how many got the scenario of this?

38
00:03:32,481 --> 00:03:32,961
Anybody?

39
00:03:32,961 --> 00:03:36,960
Well, Clint, I'll have to read you things more than, no, no, you've got it.

40
00:03:36,961 --> 00:03:37,360
Good.

41
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,080
But if anybody's going to talk about it in their paper, they're either going to have to get it or get it from the library.

42
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:45,120
I take it we have one.

43
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,281
Has anybody looked for it and not found it?

44
00:03:47,281 --> 00:03:48,721
That would be upsetting.

45
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:49,840
Okay, good.

46
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:56,401
So it turns out the poster says, live life dangerously, just go boo, to the end.

47
00:03:56,401 --> 00:04:09,920
And so the next attractive thing is that even though he's so intense and won't use the brakes, wants to do things, throws himself into everything, he does it in a way that's cool.

48
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:22,161
You can contrast him with the sweaty, panicky, serious two cops who are after him, who are equally intense, but utterly uncool.

49
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:32,880
And he is, or you can contrast him with the factuous, pompous, self-satisfied author that gets interviewed at the airport.

50
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:35,041
Also, not attractive.

51
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:41,401
In fact, there's a certain sense in which nobody, I think, in the movie is attractive except Michelle.

52
00:04:41,401 --> 00:04:44,521
That's one reason that you like him so much.

53
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
There's nobody around to like more.

54
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,320
I mean, maybe somebody with all of his characteristics who didn't steal cars and steal from their girlfriend would be more attractive, but we don't have anybody like that.

55
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,200
And he's plenty attractive already.

56
00:04:58,201 --> 00:05:00,041
I mean, how many think I'm wrong already?

57
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:03,400
I mean, do you find him attractive?

58
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:06,041
How many think he's not attractive?

59
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,041
Okay, well, that's interesting.

60
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,800
I mean, there are some always.

61
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:17,641
And interestingly enough, some women and some men, but few at least were raising their hands.

62
00:05:17,641 --> 00:05:25,960
And it would be interesting if we had time to figure out sort of from where the people who find him unattractive are coming from.

63
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:36,761
I mean, I'm going to just assume from the normal cultural morality that says that he's just a bad guy.

64
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,240
And all the things he does are bad.

65
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,080
And killing a policeman is not an attractive thing, let alone.

66
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:47,800
Again, I think in this movie, the worst thing he does is steal that money from his girlfriend.

67
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:55,880
But in any case, he has, in the movie, a kind of egoism.

68
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,080
And he does whatever it takes to make him happy.

69
00:05:59,081 --> 00:06:01,080
And he takes whatever he wants.

70
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:08,360
Remember in the gay science, Nietzsche is saying, uh-oh, I forgot to say, somebody blew their iPod last time?

71
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,360
Or is it the time of the class before this?

72
00:06:11,081 --> 00:06:12,281
Anyway, I have an iPod.

73
00:06:12,281 --> 00:06:16,841
So he, I mean, I'm getting a whole collection of interesting things.

74
00:06:16,841 --> 00:06:18,920
I think that's all I've got for today.

75
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,920
Okay, back to where we were.

76
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,721
So he's, oh, here, Beatrice, do you want?

77
00:06:24,281 --> 00:06:30,161
Okay, now, this egoism is what Nietzsche is talking about on 258.

78
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,880
I want to relate this, of course, to the gay science as much as possible.

79
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,881
And remember, that's the one where he says, Nietzsche says that egoism should have a good conscience.

80
00:06:41,521 --> 00:06:45,841
But the Christians have deprived egoism of its good conscience.

81
00:06:46,321 --> 00:06:52,800
And they deprived people of much cheerfulness, sensitivity, and poisoned it.

82
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,360
So he's got cheerfulness and sensitivity, and he's got the kind of egoism that Nietzsche would like.

83
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,121
But it's a funny kind of interesting egoism.

84
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:11,281
He does everything just spontaneously for his own happiness and satisfying his desires, but he never thinks about himself.

85
00:07:11,281 --> 00:07:14,081
He's very, very unself-conscious.

86
00:07:14,081 --> 00:07:21,120
I mean, the best way to see that, of course, is to see somebody who's totally narcissistic instead of egoistic.

87
00:07:21,281 --> 00:07:22,401
Of course, who is that?

88
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:24,560
Who thinks only about himself?

89
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,841
And that's Patricia.

90
00:07:25,841 --> 00:07:31,120
They form this interesting combination on the subject of how they relate to themselves.

91
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:42,400
But the spontaneity that I can remember, these funny, impulsive things, like when he says that skirt, the girl with the skirt makes him want to go and pick up the skirt, and she says, be my guest.

92
00:07:42,401 --> 00:07:44,401
And so he runs out and does it.

93
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,601
That's pretty charming of him, I think.

94
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:55,601
And he keeps, and he keeps, and it's more of a theme going on and on in the movie that he keeps inventing his life.

95
00:07:55,601 --> 00:08:05,760
It isn't new worlds, I can't claim that, or new horizons, even, but he certainly does go around inventing his past.

96
00:08:06,081 --> 00:08:08,481
He lives in a sort of vacuum.

97
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:15,721
There are no details of his real past except that he was an ex, he was a steward on Air France, a fact he never mentions.

98
00:08:10,321 --> 00:08:17,081
The police mention it.

99
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,400
And it's clear that if we knew the facts of his life, they would be utterly uninteresting.

100
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,201
He's just a normal, everyday punk.

101
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:30,761
Everyday, and any job that he had would be a boring job, and he wouldn't be interested in it anyway.

102
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:42,841
But in this vacuum, in which he has no interesting past, presumably, and no interesting life in the normal sense of interesting, he invents a whole bunch of glamorous lives.

103
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:48,761
Remember, his grandfather had a Rolls-Royce, and he didn't look open the hood for 15 years.

104
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,401
There was a time in the Army where his job was slitting the sentry's throats.

105
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,481
He's just come back from being assistant movie director in Nice.

106
00:08:57,481 --> 00:09:10,121
And a thing that won't strike you, but it sort of strikes you if you know about it, he has to stay in her bed or her hotel room anyway, because there's no room for him in the clarage.

107
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,641
And the clarage is the hotel where he always stays when he's in Paris.

108
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,161
The claris is like the rich.

109
00:09:15,161 --> 00:09:19,641
It's a very, very fancy, posh, expensive hotel.

110
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,961
Oh, he also does, he sold used cars in New York.

111
00:09:23,961 --> 00:09:27,241
And his father was a famous clarinetist.

112
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:36,120
What a bunch, I mean, just an endless bunch of totally incompatible and all of them obviously false stories that he makes up about himself.

113
00:09:36,441 --> 00:09:44,681
If he had really had a famous father or a serious job as assistant director, it would limit his ability to invent this life for himself.

114
00:09:44,681 --> 00:09:49,961
But in the face of relative nothing, he can invent anything.

115
00:09:49,961 --> 00:09:52,441
And now I'm just giving you a list still about him.

116
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:53,961
He's irreverent.

117
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,520
He's ready to do anything and laugh at anything.

118
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:59,041
Remember, the free spirit.

119
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,121
I'm saying he's a sort of poor man's free spirit, of course.

120
00:10:03,441 --> 00:10:07,841
And the free spirit laughs at even what is sacred.

121
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,401
Remember the place where he specifically laughs at something sacred?

122
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,921
It's the place where the guy gets killed crossing the street.

123
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:21,841
And what does he do when they see that the guy is dead?

124
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:24,240
He crosses himself.

125
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:31,681
I mean, just a tiny bit of irreverent, irreverent about death and irreverent about religion.

126
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,360
And of course, in a way, the most irreverent thing he does altogether is the way he dies.

127
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:43,201
He, in effect, refuses to take his own death seriously.

128
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:45,280
And that's pretty extreme.

129
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,761
We'll get back to that.

130
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:56,240
And now, the most amazing scene that has to do with not taking something seriously is the scene in the hotel room.

131
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,961
I mean, that makes up almost half the movie.

132
00:10:58,961 --> 00:11:03,360
That was in the original script by Truffaut, one paragraph.

133
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,161
And it just goes on and on and on, and nothing happens in it, really.

134
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,081
Nothing important.

135
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,321
Nobody shows any really serious emotions.

136
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:24,321
And it's, if you tried to say the what scene in the hotel, is it a joke scene, a love scene, a desire, passion, sex scene?

137
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:25,921
I don't know.

138
00:11:25,921 --> 00:11:27,441
It's none of those.

139
00:11:27,441 --> 00:11:30,961
It's just a kind of endless play.

140
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:33,601
And Godard just brings it off brilliantly.

141
00:11:33,601 --> 00:11:42,441
It doesn't look like any other seduction or sex scene or love scene you've ever seen, and yet it's all taking place in her bed.

142
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:43,801
It is amazing.

143
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:53,641
And what's and it ends with the radio saying, they don't translate it, work to music, and when the sheets are all spinning around.

144
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,201
And then she reaches out and turns it off.

145
00:11:56,201 --> 00:11:59,961
Then there's one of Godard's usual incomprehensible cuts.

146
00:11:59,961 --> 00:12:06,121
One minute they're in bed, and the next minute he's coming out of the bathroom, and you're not showing any transitional thing.

147
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:16,041
I mean, I'm just in the background of what I'm saying, and I'll come back to it at the end if there's time, is he's just destroying all the conventions that usually are used in movies to make sense of things.

148
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,520
People go through intermediate steps when they're in bed and then come out of the bathroom.

149
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,881
You see them going in.

150
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,841
Or the beginning of the movie, weren't you very confused?

151
00:12:24,841 --> 00:12:31,961
There was this girl making gestures and there was him looking around and there were boats going by and then so forth.

152
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:43,560
What was missing was what they call an establishing shot where you could see him and her and how they were related to each other and then you could see him up close and her up close.

153
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:44,841
But you don't get that.

154
00:12:44,841 --> 00:12:51,561
So you never really know until afterward that she was helping him steal a car.

155
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:54,120
And Godard is doing all this on purpose.

156
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,721
We'll get back to that.

157
00:12:55,721 --> 00:13:00,041
Okay, so, and now we get to the interesting thing with him and Brief Habits.

158
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:10,441
He's clearly in an interesting Nietzschean place because he's against eternal love and unconditional commitments.

159
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:19,881
That is, when she says, let's be like Romeo and Juliet, in effect, he says, she says, I wish we were Romeo and Juliet.

160
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,081
I'll give page numbers in here.

161
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,761
I want to look it up sometime.

162
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,320
So 72, she says, I wish I were Romeo and Juliet.

163
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:31,521
And Michelle says, oh, la la, what a girlish idea.

164
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:38,000
And yet, he says, he can't live without her.

165
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:44,000
Right after that, she says, you see, you said last night in the car you couldn't live without me, but you can.

166
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:49,921
Romeo couldn't live without Juliet, but you can live, you can, you can.

167
00:13:49,921 --> 00:13:52,081
And he says, no, I can't live without you.

168
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,801
And she says, oh, la la, just a boyish idea.

169
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:59,201
Well, but what's really going on is it's true he can't live without her.

170
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:03,681
He is ready to risk his life to stay with her by the end.

171
00:14:03,681 --> 00:14:04,961
But what is it?

172
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:08,000
Is it an eternal commitment like Romeo and Juliet?

173
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,281
Certainly not.

174
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,640
It's a brief habit.

175
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,041
That is, he's in it right now.

176
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:19,201
Right now, only sex with her clicks with him, as he tells one of his friends.

177
00:14:19,201 --> 00:14:23,440
That is, right now, she's fascinating to him and exciting.

178
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:31,041
And though you wonder in a way why he finds her fascinating and exciting, she is in a certain way such a loser.

179
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,921
But that's maybe what's fascinating and exciting.

180
00:14:33,921 --> 00:14:36,801
We have to wait and see that.

181
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:42,401
But he admits that in a certain way he could live without her.

182
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,360
I mean, it is sort of a brief habit thing.

183
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:56,321
On 61, when they go through the same thing, she says, I can't do without you, he says.

184
00:14:56,321 --> 00:14:58,321
You can very well, she says.

185
00:14:58,321 --> 00:15:00,561
But I don't want to, he says.

186
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,601
And in the same sentence, look at it, look, a Talbot.

187
00:15:03,601 --> 00:15:04,321
A Talbot.

188
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,161
That's a kind of car I gather.

189
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,201
It's beautiful.

190
00:15:07,201 --> 00:15:09,921
I mean, all in the same speech, in the same sentence.

191
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:18,201
He's always looking at everything that he finds attractive: the Fost de la Concorde at night, this car that goes by.

192
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:19,320
I forget what else.

193
00:15:19,321 --> 00:15:24,601
But he's open to anything that's interesting in the world.

194
00:15:24,601 --> 00:15:28,441
But it looks like, for sure, he's got something like a brief habit.

195
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:37,801
He can't picture, right now, at this point, he can't picture living without her, but he's perfectly clear to him that that's just what's going on at this point.

196
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:45,241
And now, more important, and I'm sort of building up to the ultimate one, he's got a positive interest in nothingness.

197
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,841
And he likes it.

198
00:15:46,841 --> 00:15:48,601
He's not afraid of death.

199
00:15:48,601 --> 00:15:50,681
He's fascinated by death.

200
00:15:50,681 --> 00:15:53,641
He says he thinks about death constantly.

201
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:58,761
And even he once pretends to be dead in Patricia's lap.

202
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:08,841
And I just found out, I was rereading, I'd read it once before, but not lately, in the introduction.

203
00:16:08,841 --> 00:16:15,721
And at one place, Godard, in an interview, I don't know if I'm going to be able to find it again.

204
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,961
I marked it, but I don't know how.

205
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:23,481
Because I was surprised how much death is supposed to be important to him.

206
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:25,640
I thought it was sort of a thing.

207
00:16:25,961 --> 00:16:31,721
But Godard makes a big fuss about how he thinks the movie's about it.

208
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,721
Yeah, here it is.

209
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:35,321
No, no.

210
00:16:35,641 --> 00:16:42,361
Well, anyway, Godard points out that death is always in it.

211
00:16:42,361 --> 00:16:45,080
Michelle says he thinks about death all the time.

212
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,601
There's the guy killed on the street.

213
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,360
There's the policeman killed.

214
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,080
He has other things about death, too.

215
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,760
Well, it doesn't really matter.

216
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:57,441
It's obvious from just the fact that he says he thinks about death all the time.

217
00:16:57,441 --> 00:17:03,920
And it's close to him throughout the film, and it doesn't frighten him, and it doesn't make his life meaningless.

218
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:05,201
That's probably the wrong thing.

219
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,681
Of course, it doesn't make his life meaningless because meaning isn't something he's interested in.

220
00:17:09,681 --> 00:17:12,560
And it doesn't make his life uninteresting.

221
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,240
It doesn't make his life not worth living.

222
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,080
I'll put it that way.

223
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:27,520
And it's interesting if you contrast that with Merceau in The Stranger, which all of you have read, I remember, from when I asked you.

224
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:37,520
And of course, for Merceau, it's precisely death, the cold wind blowing from the future, as Cameron calls it, which makes everything meaningless.

225
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,000
And it just doesn't have that effect on Michelle Poitard.

226
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,401
He isn't in the meaning business, but he finds death fascinating.

227
00:17:48,721 --> 00:17:51,601
And the fact that nothing has any meaning is good.

228
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,800
That's, again, for the free spirit, an openness to appreciate everything.

229
00:17:57,441 --> 00:18:12,560
By the way, one of the things he notices, he notices lots of things, but just on an aside, sort of, the man who turns him in, when he's sitting in the car in front of the New York Times, looks at him, looks at the newspaper, looks away.

230
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,920
That's Godard.

231
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:19,360
He put himself in the movie, in case you want to know what he looks like if you play it again on a DVD.

232
00:18:19,361 --> 00:18:23,840
He's following Hitchcock, who always puts himself in some little place in the movie.

233
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,201
But relevant to what we're talking about, Michelle is perfectly ready.

234
00:18:27,201 --> 00:18:29,360
He knows that he's been seen.

235
00:18:29,361 --> 00:18:35,600
He knows that the informer has gone over and told a policeman and that there's people rushing around.

236
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,800
And he doesn't drive off because he's waiting for Patricia.

237
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,961
And he's just totally.

238
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:47,000
He's bold and he's following his desires.

239
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,240
And right then, he wants to see Patricia.

240
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:55,481
And the fact that he's been found doesn't affect him.

241
00:18:56,441 --> 00:18:58,040
Let's see where we are now.

242
00:18:58,361 --> 00:19:03,641
So to sum up, Michelle, he's an active nihilist, is what I'm getting at.

243
00:19:03,641 --> 00:19:15,880
I mean, I've been saying he's a free spirit, but an active nihilist is exactly a free spirit who finds, I brought with me, I thought, I'm sure I did.

244
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,840
Here it is.

245
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:30,760
The definition of an active nihilism, a nihilist is the active nihilist is a sign of increased power of the spirit and all the characteristics that go with it.

246
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:39,721
And Godard thinks of himself in a way as being this kind of nihilist.

247
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:44,600
And because of its fits, I'll read it.

248
00:19:45,641 --> 00:19:51,641
In an interview with Godard, he says, the genre of Breathless was such that all was permitted.

249
00:19:51,641 --> 00:19:54,441
Just listen to this with Nietzsche overtones.

250
00:19:54,441 --> 00:19:55,881
That was its nature.

251
00:19:55,881 --> 00:19:59,640
Whatever people might do, all this could be put in the film.

252
00:19:59,641 --> 00:20:01,800
This was even my point of departure.

253
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,601
I said to myself, we just have Hiroshima Monomur, just like you guys.

254
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:21,160
A certain kind of cinema has just ended, meaning a well-made movie, where every shot is perfectly posed and everything is motivated visually so that no there are no jump cuts and such things as that.

255
00:20:21,201 --> 00:20:26,961
We've j well then, he says, we've just, a certain kind of cinema has just ended.

256
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:29,520
Well then let's put the period to it.

257
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:31,840
Let's show that anything goes.

258
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:34,560
And that's and that's what he's doing.

259
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:40,880
He's showing in the in making the movie that anything goes.

260
00:20:40,881 --> 00:20:44,320
I mean there are so many strange things that you don't even notice.

261
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,201
But one of them, for instance, is that there are no credits.

262
00:20:49,201 --> 00:20:55,441
You don't know who's you don't know about Belmondo and Gene Seaberg or that Jean-Luc Godard made the movie.

263
00:20:55,441 --> 00:21:01,040
It just plunges into this incomprehensible car stealing scene.

264
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,360
Oh here I found the death thing as I was going through here.

265
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:05,040
It's in another interview.

266
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,400
Things couldn't go well between them.

267
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:14,640
He's talking about the American girl and the Frenchman because he thinks about death all the time while she never gives it a thought.

268
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:19,600
I told myself that if I didn't add this idea to the scenario, the film wouldn't be interesting at all.

269
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,520
The guy is obsessed with death.

270
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,441
He even has pre-sentiments of it.

271
00:21:23,441 --> 00:21:27,920
That's why I shot the scene of the accident when you see the man die on the street.

272
00:21:27,921 --> 00:21:34,641
And I chose the this is this is the only thing that was news to me and I chose the Mozart clarinet concerto.

273
00:21:34,641 --> 00:21:40,481
That's the music at the end when he's gone and was lying there and listening to the the record.

274
00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:45,360
I chose the Mozart clarinet concerto because Mozart wrote it just before he died.

275
00:21:45,361 --> 00:21:49,441
I mean funny thing you can't see in the movie, but that's what he did.

276
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,800
Okay, now where are we?

277
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:04,080
Yeah, so so I stop with him and with Godard, who's doing who's a free spirit, making a movie for free spirits about a free spirit.

278
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,880
That's all implied in what I've just been saying.

279
00:22:06,881 --> 00:22:13,961
And if you don't wanna if you wanna say anything about it, about him or that, now is the time, because I'm switching to Patricia.

280
00:22:10,161 --> 00:22:15,640
Ah, Beatrice, yeah.

281
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:21,961
The Nietzsche and Godard inform that they both know their tradition really, really well.

282
00:22:21,961 --> 00:22:25,961
They build on their dance from out of that.

283
00:22:25,961 --> 00:22:28,600
But the Delmanda character didn't know who they were.

284
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,280
That's interesting.

285
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,160
That's true.

286
00:22:31,161 --> 00:22:32,601
It's now if you raise it.

287
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,041
Out of that comes an interesting question.

288
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,921
Does the Nietzschean free spirit have to know about tradition?

289
00:22:36,921 --> 00:22:37,321
I don't know.

290
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,520
Godard is probably maybe less of a free spirit.

291
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:47,800
Nietzsche does say that he thinks that what's important is not remembering, but forgetting for the free spirit.

292
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:53,880
And you don't try to remember whether people are guilty or not or accuse them or forgive them.

293
00:22:53,881 --> 00:22:56,280
If they do bad things to you, you just forget it.

294
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,721
You've got better things to worry about.

295
00:22:57,961 --> 00:22:59,880
That's how the free spirit thinks.

296
00:23:00,681 --> 00:23:12,201
So the fact that Bel Nando has no past and Godard has a tradition probably doesn't make any difference inside the movie when you're trying to be Nietzschean or not.

297
00:23:12,201 --> 00:23:15,080
At least that's my claim.

298
00:23:15,881 --> 00:23:16,520
Anything else?

299
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,400
I saw another hand.

300
00:23:17,401 --> 00:23:18,441
Went back there first.

301
00:23:18,441 --> 00:23:18,920
Yeah.

302
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:29,160
I hope I'm giving perfection, like you can style, because we're not in discussion when you're like because our inbox is balloon, too.

303
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:30,760
Yeah.

304
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,961
Well, yeah, I think he admires bogey style.

305
00:23:35,961 --> 00:23:38,760
Well, I was going to get to that later, but now we can talk about it.

306
00:23:39,161 --> 00:23:47,080
He certainly doesn't admire anything specific he does, and he doesn't want to have exactly that style, I don't think.

307
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,520
But did anybody know?

308
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,601
I think I may have asked that, this gesture.

309
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,201
Somebody told me that's a bogey gesture, and it must be, though.

310
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:55,401
I don't remember when I've ever seen it.

311
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,240
Do you know when he is that a is that some?

312
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:04,800
Yeah, I mean, he does it when he's watching the Bogart picture, and certainly we should say it now or someplace.

313
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:13,760
You see him staring at something with total devotion, which if there's anything sacred in his life, that would be it.

314
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:34,160
And lo and behold, it turns out to be that wonderful picture of Bogart, and he stares at it and he makes that special gesture, which I take it, and I think it's going to turn out to be important, has been passed on from Bogart to him and is somehow a sign that he's taking up Bogart's style, only in his own way.

315
00:24:34,401 --> 00:24:35,840
And he knows he is.

316
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,880
He doesn't reflect on it because he never reflects on anything.

317
00:24:38,881 --> 00:24:42,721
But that is his idol.

318
00:24:42,721 --> 00:24:46,800
I don't know whether, I mean, it's funny, I'm not even sure he'd be able to laugh at Bogart, though.

319
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,441
If he's a really good free spirit, he's got to be able to be even to make fun of him.

320
00:24:51,441 --> 00:24:51,841
Yeah.

321
00:24:52,481 --> 00:24:55,520
Well, but both of them also, like Mr.

322
00:24:55,681 --> 00:25:00,320
Bunny, when you beat it, we've all fit Bogart.

323
00:25:01,361 --> 00:25:04,160
What about what's in the Maltese Falcon that you're talking about?

324
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,040
The music is the same?

325
00:25:07,681 --> 00:25:08,320
Ah.

326
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,840
Gee, interesting.

327
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,441
What?

328
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,800
I believe it, yeah, yep.

329
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,601
Oh, okay.

330
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,481
Let's go on, because there's questions to cover.

331
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:24,320
I'm going on to Patricia Frankini.

332
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,081
I didn't ignore anybody, did I?

333
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,920
I think I saw the hands.

334
00:25:27,921 --> 00:25:29,681
Okay, let's do it.

335
00:25:29,921 --> 00:25:34,880
Well, she's obviously the negative self-death-bying person.

336
00:25:35,361 --> 00:25:37,681
When you look into it, it's really amazing.

337
00:25:37,681 --> 00:25:46,840
I doubt if Godard really thought this out, but you can see that she's negated almost everything.

338
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:53,800
Her occupation is she's taken up and dropped a whole bunch of occupational roles.

339
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:58,280
She seems to have repudiated her family, her country.

340
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,201
She's come to Paris to study at the Sorbonne, but she doesn't study.

341
00:26:02,201 --> 00:26:05,721
She's working on a book, she says, but she isn't writing anything.

342
00:26:05,721 --> 00:26:11,560
She wants to be a reporter, and she does go to the press conference, but we don't see any sign that she's writing it up.

343
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,640
Her job, and those are her non-occupations.

344
00:26:15,961 --> 00:26:17,481
Her job is fascinating.

345
00:26:17,481 --> 00:26:23,320
Selling Hero Tribunes on the Champs-Élysées is the least committed job you could have in the world.

346
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,161
You just do it if you feel like it.

347
00:26:25,161 --> 00:26:30,040
You go and buy a bunch of Herald Tribunes at your rate, and you go and sell them at the higher rate.

348
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,961
You don't have to come back the next day.

349
00:26:31,961 --> 00:26:34,280
You don't have any medical insurance.

350
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,880
You don't have to, you know, it's just the minimal job.

351
00:26:37,881 --> 00:26:41,961
And she doesn't even seem to sell any Herald Tribunes except to him, one.

352
00:26:42,361 --> 00:26:46,520
She has got, occupationally, she's totally zero.

353
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,400
Now, and gender-wise, she's very interesting.

354
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:52,121
I think, though, I'll be interested to see what you think.

355
00:26:52,121 --> 00:26:55,400
She seemingly repudiates her femininity.

356
00:26:55,401 --> 00:26:58,920
She walks with that awkward, unfeminine gait.

357
00:26:58,921 --> 00:27:05,400
I don't know if it's masculine, it's just awkward, and wears her hair cut in that severely short way.

358
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:08,041
Does that seem unfeminine to you all?

359
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,680
Or, I mean, we've got to remember that this is earlier, too.

360
00:27:10,681 --> 00:27:15,961
I'm afraid we partly this is a problem of what it what people felt in what, the 50s?

361
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:17,320
When was this movie made?

362
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,000
Late 50s, I think.

363
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,601
Middle, maybe early 50s.

364
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,681
Hmm?

365
00:27:23,320 --> 00:28:56,041
56, is somebody's 66 oh really okay yeah right before the big events of May in 68 okay so I don't so you don't think so and and the fact that she wears his clothes then has no bra I don't know what this what this really means in at that point it seemed to mean somehow shocking to him that she didn't have a bra and he would and he just he's supposed to be immune to being shocked yeah but she well okay so you you don't think she's somehow repudiating being a woman I okay I don't need that I mean if it's all right with me she's certainly got the the occupation thing is negative and a certain aspect of being a woman seems to be something she's not concerned with namely being pregnant she she doesn't seem to care whether she is or isn't she brings it up just to see whether how he's going to feel about it naturally he feels as if it it's her problem but she doesn't seem to be looking for marriage or an abortion or planning to what to do with the baby she just seems to ignore this as a sort of little problem that'll go not even young just forget it so that was that's strange and she seems somehow this is a funny thing repudiate her adulthood by hugging her teddy bear and then I just looked out and discovered that everybody in the audience was hugging their teddy bear and I remembered that my son took his security blanket away to boarding school when he was 15 he still had his security blanket even though he left home.

366
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:02,840
So, I don't know how many have still their their teddy bear to hug any you're not going to admit it.

367
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,481
Okay.

368
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:10,120
Anyway, she does, and I I'm going to read that as somehow not wanting to grow up.

369
00:29:10,121 --> 00:29:16,681
So, she's not American, not French, not a student, not a writer, not an adult, maybe not a woman, and so forth.

370
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:19,961
Michelle calls her a Mar, Michelle calls her a Martian.

371
00:29:19,961 --> 00:29:23,481
I think being a Martian is how he senses that.

372
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,080
And even, and this is very interesting, she wants to repudiate her name.

373
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,000
She says she doesn't want to be called Patricia, she wants to be called Ingrid.

374
00:29:31,161 --> 00:29:33,640
Do you know anything funny about that?

375
00:29:33,641 --> 00:29:41,481
Bogey and Ingrid are part, it seems like Casablanca shows up in all the movies we see in some weird, indirect way.

376
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,840
Godard doesn't make anything of it.

377
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,080
He just mentions it.

378
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:59,800
So if she had dedicated herself to being Ingrid, the way Bogey is somehow dedicated, I mean, Michelle has somehow dedicated himself to being Bogey, then her life would have been very different.

379
00:30:00,121 --> 00:30:03,721
But she doesn't, she just doesn't know what to do or what to think.

380
00:30:03,721 --> 00:30:05,320
She says, I don't know if I'm unhappy.

381
00:30:05,401 --> 00:30:06,840
She's certainly unhappy.

382
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,120
She's glum all the time or something like that.

383
00:30:10,121 --> 00:30:14,120
Whereas whatever the opposite of cheerful is, she's it.

384
00:30:14,681 --> 00:30:17,481
And glum seems to be the best word I could come up with.

385
00:30:17,481 --> 00:30:23,320
She says, I don't know if I'm unhappy because I'm not free or not free because I'm not happy.

386
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,881
And that's she doesn't, and then she says, I'm thinking of nothing.

387
00:30:27,881 --> 00:30:30,600
I want to think of something, but I can't.

388
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:37,000
And she seems to be in a grumpy mood because nothing means anything.

389
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,681
Whereas Michelle can fill the void with all kinds of irreverent creativity.

390
00:30:42,681 --> 00:30:49,000
She only complains that meaning is missing, and she feels sort of sorry about it.

391
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,920
And that's about it.

392
00:30:51,881 --> 00:30:56,721
And to put it more sort of philosophically, she's afraid of nothingness.

393
00:30:55,161 --> 00:31:02,000
She sees behind his face that there is nothing, and that really frightens her.

394
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:17,840
There is, she's right, there is no identity, no fixed commitments, and that's so on page 86, he says, You know, he said, I was afraid, Michelle, I am afraid.

395
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,520
Oh, no, I'm going to read that one later.

396
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:24,560
This one, she says, I've watched you for 10 minutes, I see nothing, nothing.

397
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,880
I'm not sad, but I'm afraid.

398
00:31:26,881 --> 00:31:28,880
And so she's afraid of nothing.

399
00:31:28,881 --> 00:31:30,961
And then comes this wonderful quote.

400
00:31:30,961 --> 00:31:40,800
I mean, if you weren't sure yet that Godard was writing with sort of Nietzsche in one hand, you get this talk about Faulkner, which is so funny and so relevant.

401
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:46,000
She says, Do you know William Faulkner?

402
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,521
And he says, No, who's he?

403
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,961
Have you slept with him?

404
00:31:48,961 --> 00:31:51,600
And she says, Of course not.

405
00:31:51,921 --> 00:31:53,441
He's then to hell with him.

406
00:31:53,441 --> 00:31:54,800
Take off your shirt.

407
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,680
And she's, he's, the dialogue is just as amazing reading it as seeing it.

408
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:02,640
She says, he's a novelist that I like.

409
00:32:02,641 --> 00:32:04,560
Have you read The Wild Palms?

410
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,481
He says, take your jersey off.

411
00:32:06,881 --> 00:32:07,680
And she's listening.

412
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,441
The last sentence is beautiful.

413
00:32:09,441 --> 00:32:11,120
And she reads it in English.

414
00:32:11,121 --> 00:32:15,040
Between grief and nothing, I will take grief.

415
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,760
Between grief and nothingness, I choose grief.

416
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,520
She translates it into French.

417
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,961
And which would you choose?

418
00:32:20,961 --> 00:32:22,401
Well, let's stop for a minute.

419
00:32:22,401 --> 00:32:26,640
You recognize what she should say if she's a passive nihilist.

420
00:32:26,881 --> 00:32:29,520
You recognize anything from Nietzsche?

421
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,481
Nietzsche comes up with this in a way.

422
00:32:32,481 --> 00:32:41,961
I mean, Nietzsche thinks, I think there's even better passages than I could find, but Nietzsche certainly thinks that, where are we?

423
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:56,841
In Twilight of the Idols on 33, if anybody finds a better quote, I think Nietzsche says somewhere, but I couldn't find it, that we're so addicted to meaning that we'd rather have suffering than give up meaning.

424
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,681
Does that sound familiar?

425
00:32:59,161 --> 00:33:02,441
The best I could find was the bottom of 33 of Twilight.

426
00:33:02,441 --> 00:33:06,520
If we possess a why of life, we can put up with almost any how.

427
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,441
That's pathway there.

428
00:33:08,441 --> 00:33:17,000
I mean, no matter how much we suffer and how much we're miserable, if we understand why our lives are like that, then we're okay.

429
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
But I'm sure there's some place where he says people would rather suffer than have a meaningless life.

430
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,561
Yeah.

431
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:25,640
Yes, that's right.

432
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,401
Well, Faulkner may be in there.

433
00:33:27,401 --> 00:33:27,961
That's true.

434
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,401
And the passage is perfect.

435
00:33:29,401 --> 00:33:30,200
Another comment.

436
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:30,520
Yeah.

437
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:33,560
What about it?

438
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,040
I see.

439
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:45,961
Well, I, I mean, that's when they all say these sort of independent things as they walk around the room at the end after he knows that she's turned him in.

440
00:33:46,921 --> 00:33:49,401
I think that's just his openness.

441
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:59,161
The contrast with which what she says under the sheet, in the bed, she says, it's strange when I look at your eyes, I just see myself.

442
00:33:59,401 --> 00:34:00,600
That's the difference.

443
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,680
I mean, I think that's just another way of saying.

444
00:34:02,761 --> 00:34:09,241
I mean, you can be an egoist like he is and still want to be, you know, open and involved with conversation with other people.

445
00:34:09,241 --> 00:34:13,561
But to be a narcissist like she is, wherever she looks, she sees herself.

446
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:26,560
She sees herself in the mirror in a store window, and you see her looking with the same rapt attention as if she was seeing a god, practically, and you wonder, what in the world is she looking at?

447
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:31,040
It turns out she's looking in a mirror in the store window at herself.

448
00:34:25,321 --> 00:34:32,080
And she pats her stomach.

449
00:34:32,241 --> 00:34:38,321
I don't know whether she thinks she's getting fat or whether she's worried that she's getting pregnant, but that's all you see of that.

450
00:34:38,321 --> 00:34:45,681
But then she's hanging this Renoir picture in the room, and she asks him, Don't you think I look like her?

451
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:53,601
She selects her paintings, not by the artist, or not by even whether they look good in her room, but whether they look like her.

452
00:34:53,600 --> 00:35:04,081
She is really narcissistic, and I don't have more to say about that, but I do think it's very important to go back to his comment about the Faulkner quote.

453
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:08,161
She says that she would take grief.

454
00:35:08,801 --> 00:35:10,240
She says, I choose grief.

455
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:11,200
What would you choose?

456
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,921
And of course, he says, the dialogue is so amazing.

457
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:17,200
He says, show me your toes.

458
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,040
A woman's toes are most important.

459
00:35:19,361 --> 00:35:20,321
Don't laugh.

460
00:35:20,321 --> 00:35:21,760
No, what would you choose?

461
00:35:21,761 --> 00:35:22,641
She says.

462
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,560
He says, Grief is idiotic.

463
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,321
I choose nothingness.

464
00:35:26,321 --> 00:35:30,160
Not that it's better, but grief is a compromise.

465
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,161
You have to have all or nothing.

466
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:40,640
That's, you know, again, keep your, don't always accelerate and what, do something, just kaboom.

467
00:35:40,801 --> 00:35:42,481
What's that expression again?

468
00:35:42,961 --> 00:35:44,401
What's the poster?

469
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,961
Action, just, you know, the poster.

470
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,680
Anyway, he's doing this thing again, all or nothing.

471
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:58,481
It's like never, oh, never step on the brake, and you always, well, I don't remember, but keeping up to the end.

472
00:35:58,481 --> 00:35:59,760
And so that's it.

473
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:06,481
So he chooses naturally that.

474
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:07,680
Oh, look, and here it is.

475
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,840
I opened it just from under the sheet.

476
00:36:09,841 --> 00:36:11,160
She says, it's strange.

477
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:11,481
What?

478
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,801
I see my reflection in your eyes.

479
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,961
That's on page 89.

480
00:36:16,761 --> 00:36:20,841
So he says, oh, it's live dangerously just to the end.

481
00:36:21,881 --> 00:36:25,400
So that's tied up with his no compromises view.

482
00:36:25,401 --> 00:36:27,561
He's not going to grief as a compromise.

483
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,241
He's ready to choose nothing.

484
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,281
And he does in the end choose nothing.

485
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:42,441
Meanwhile, while he hasn't actually chosen to die yet, he's acting out a fantasy of the fellow who steals money, takes a girl away to Italy.

486
00:36:42,441 --> 00:36:47,401
They support themselves by stealing cars, and finally you get her caught and go to prison together.

487
00:36:47,401 --> 00:36:52,361
And Patricia doesn't have any sort of fantasy like that to guide her life.

488
00:36:52,361 --> 00:36:54,040
She can't think of anything.

489
00:36:54,441 --> 00:36:56,280
She says that at one point.

490
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,441
She says it sort of all over.

491
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:06,361
The one I happened to mark is at the top of 71, I'd like to think of something, but I can't.

492
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:11,241
And then they have this discussion with this thing, which I'm going to talk about in a minute.

493
00:37:11,241 --> 00:37:13,720
And she says, why are you, he says, why are you looking?

494
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,520
No, never mind.

495
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,040
It would get ahead of the story.

496
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:26,361
So she's she does she and is Patricia so afraid if Patricia is so afraid, why does she want a love oh no, where am I?

497
00:37:26,361 --> 00:37:27,800
Okay, now next point.

498
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,081
Her view of freedom is a negative kind of freedom.

499
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,481
She says she wants her independence.

500
00:37:33,481 --> 00:37:36,520
She says, I quote, I want people to leave me alone.

501
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,841
It's a negative kind of freedom.

502
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:43,321
It there's no no responsibility, no commitment.

503
00:37:43,321 --> 00:37:47,561
And then I it's puzzling if that's true, and I'm sure it is.

504
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,761
Why does she want to love like Romeo and Juliet?

505
00:37:50,761 --> 00:37:52,841
Well, she doesn't really.

506
00:37:53,241 --> 00:37:55,481
And and that'll get clearer as things go on.

507
00:37:59,841 --> 00:38:08,481
As soon as it becomes a question of a real commitment, she is a coward and chickens out.

508
00:38:08,481 --> 00:38:10,000
The translation calls her a chicken.

509
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,801
The French is really just coward.

510
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:22,000
So when she falls in love with Michelle, then she gets to be afraid of losing her freedom and her sort of nothing.

511
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,880
And she acts on that.

512
00:38:24,881 --> 00:38:26,481
But we're not ready quite for that.

513
00:38:26,481 --> 00:38:28,160
So she doesn't want to take any risks.

514
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,121
She doesn't want to do anything in order to have meaning in her life.

515
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,640
But she can't be a free spirit like Michelle and live dangerously.

516
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,801
She's too weak to live dangerously.

517
00:38:36,801 --> 00:38:40,721
So he keeps telling her over and over, you're a coward.

518
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:50,641
And when they really do get into, from her point of view, a Romeo and Juliet kind of relation, at that point is where she turns him in.

519
00:38:51,441 --> 00:38:53,361
And I'm just summing her up now.

520
00:38:53,361 --> 00:38:55,200
Nothing has meaning in her world.

521
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,721
Far from finding it exhilarating that nothing has any meaning.

522
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,681
And a chance to be cheerful and creative, she is disgruntled and apathetic.

523
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,000
In a word, what is she?

524
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,641
She's a passive nihilist, of course.

525
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:13,761
I mean, I don't think Godard even knows how he's got this so beautifully lined up.

526
00:39:15,281 --> 00:39:20,961
And passive nihilism says decline, recession of power, and so forth.

527
00:39:20,961 --> 00:39:23,040
And that's her.

528
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:26,000
Now, Quail, comments.

529
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,281
We finished Patricia, so it's time for more comments if you've got them.

530
00:39:29,281 --> 00:39:30,240
It's pretty.

531
00:39:30,321 --> 00:39:30,801
Yeah.

532
00:39:35,441 --> 00:39:43,720
Well, only if he, I see, well, no, the question is whether you would choose meaningless or grief.

533
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,520
And he chooses, or is it nothing?

534
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,600
Whichever, meaninglessness or nothing.

535
00:39:50,441 --> 00:39:51,401
It's nothing.

536
00:39:51,401 --> 00:39:54,840
Okay, but nothing is fine with him.

537
00:39:55,321 --> 00:40:09,000
But grief is a compromise, meaning that it's for people who aren't able to go all the way and accept the complete emptiness and meaninglessness of everything.

538
00:40:09,481 --> 00:40:12,201
So he naturally chooses nothing.

539
00:40:12,441 --> 00:40:15,640
He likes, I mean, he's been thinking about death all his life.

540
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,040
That's the big deal, nothing.

541
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:48,281
But mainly, I tried to say back when I talked about him, the nothingness is what gives him the opportunity to create all these lives and enjoy all these experiences and be observant of everything and so forth, be cheerful and alive, only because he's not sort of tampered by convictions, commitments, moral rules, ambitions, anything.

542
00:40:48,281 --> 00:40:51,401
I don't know if that's a help, but it'll have to do for him a while.

543
00:40:51,401 --> 00:40:52,841
Maybe we can come back to it.

544
00:40:52,841 --> 00:40:53,881
I'm going on.

545
00:40:53,881 --> 00:40:56,760
Okay, now, because we've got to make sure we cover this.

546
00:40:56,761 --> 00:41:05,081
Now we're ready to get to the relation between Michelle and Patricia, which ought to become beginning to become sort of obvious to you.

547
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:10,361
Why is it that for Michelle, it only clicks with Patricia?

548
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,641
You would think, you might think that he'd hate her.

549
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:21,481
After all, he says at the very beginning, if you don't like Franch, the sea, the mountains, the big city, go fuck yourself.

550
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:22,681
That's what it says.

551
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,160
You get stuffed or something, it says in the translation.

552
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,401
And that's on page 35.

553
00:41:25,401 --> 00:41:32,800
But you remember that probably, because that's the first thing he says in the movie.

554
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,720
And Patricia certainly doesn't love any of those things.

555
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,201
So she's utterly unlike him.

556
00:41:42,401 --> 00:42:03,841
But you get a clue as to why it clicks with her if you compare her to this attractive, sincere, good-looking, hard-working, trusting, loving, moral girl that is there at the beginning of the movie, just, I think, to establish the traditional coordinates.

557
00:42:03,841 --> 00:42:05,200
She's just perfect.

558
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,401
She's so beautiful.

559
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:07,520
She's so nice.

560
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,640
She's so trusting.

561
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,881
She's so generous with her money.

562
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,361
And her job, she doesn't want to be in films because you have to sleep with too many guys.

563
00:42:17,361 --> 00:42:21,841
And she earns an honest living, whatever it is, and she seems to like her work.

564
00:42:21,841 --> 00:42:27,601
And in other words, she's the only traditional, decent, moral person in the movie.

565
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:34,321
And the last person that Michelle would have any relation to, or who would understand him or care about him.

566
00:42:34,321 --> 00:42:36,481
I don't know why she does care about him.

567
00:42:36,481 --> 00:42:40,160
I think because he's just really kind of handsome hunk.

568
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,400
But I don't know what it is.

569
00:42:42,401 --> 00:42:43,761
We don't need to know.

570
00:42:44,321 --> 00:42:51,600
But whatever it is, she's the only person who is neither an active nor a passive nihilist in the movie.

571
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,600
I mean, I guess.

572
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,601
I mean, the police are people, maybe, and I don't know what to say about them.

573
00:42:58,321 --> 00:43:07,520
But the interesting thing is, again, I hope you're all resisting my sort of mapping this on Nietzsche so much.

574
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:13,080
But the real trick is one that doesn't dawn on you for the first, I don't know, 15 times you see it.

575
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:38,441
But sooner or later, you notice a very peculiar thing: that when he's in the room with this girl, who is, so to speak, you might say, the last of the decent people in the marketplace who hasn't heard the news about the desk of God, he says, the camera reveals that on the wall are the first five letters of the word pour croix, which is why.

576
00:43:38,441 --> 00:43:40,681
And he says, what's written there?

577
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:44,761
Pour qui, she says, but I never finished it.

578
00:43:44,761 --> 00:43:51,560
And she was making it out of cigarette cartons, and she switched to Lucky's, from Nevermind from Galois.

579
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,360
That the important thing, of course, isn't the bank.

580
00:43:54,361 --> 00:43:55,801
What's the important thing?

581
00:43:55,801 --> 00:44:01,481
That she was writing on the wall why, and she didn't finish it.

582
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:11,240
Remember, if you remember that in Will to Power, the whole story about nihilism is that what does nihilism mean?

583
00:44:11,241 --> 00:44:14,040
The highest values devaluate themselves.

584
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,481
The aim is lacking.

585
00:44:15,481 --> 00:44:17,401
Why finds no answer?

586
00:44:17,401 --> 00:44:20,441
Well, you can't get to the point where why finds no answer.

587
00:44:20,761 --> 00:44:22,921
You're ready to ask about everything.

588
00:44:22,921 --> 00:44:24,120
Why should we do this?

589
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,160
Why are we here?

590
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,441
Why be moral?

591
00:44:26,921 --> 00:44:28,040
Why everything?

592
00:44:28,361 --> 00:44:37,720
And then you either go into the zero slump of Patricia or the happy, exact, cheerful life of Michelle.

593
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:41,081
But she hasn't gone to the end of asking the why question.

594
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,401
She ran out of cigarette cartons.

595
00:44:43,441 --> 00:44:50,681
But the interesting thing is, I mean, that's a total, I think, reference to the passage I just read.

596
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:55,600
And that's to say, she's not a passive nihilist or an active nihilist.

597
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:59,520
She hasn't carried through her thinking that far.

598
00:44:59,841 --> 00:45:04,401
She still accepts the current meaning, the current values, and so forth.

599
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:08,241
She can't get to the point where the why has no answer.

600
00:45:08,241 --> 00:45:10,560
So now, so no wonder it doesn't click with her.

601
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,800
Ah, yeah, she could, but she isn't.

602
00:45:12,801 --> 00:45:13,840
Obviously, she is.

603
00:45:13,841 --> 00:45:15,120
I go back to my list.

604
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,080
I mean, she's not a free spirit.

605
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,040
She is, well, she's just wonderful in this.

606
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,121
I made this great list about her.

607
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:29,201
She is hardworking, trusting, loving, has moral principles.

608
00:45:29,441 --> 00:45:34,000
That's why she won't go into the movies, generous, and so forth.

609
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,681
I mean, she just seems to be an utterly decent, old-fashioned human being.

610
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,680
I mean, if you think she's a free spirit, you have to find some evidence somewhere.

611
00:45:44,000 --> 00:46:04,401
She's there to set off the kind of girl, I think, for whom it doesn't click, that Michelle is just not interested in, no matter how nice, no matter how loving, no matter how attractive, against Patricia, who has none of those qualities I just read, but has something that she's asked the why question.

612
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,081
That's my version.

613
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:11,201
I mean, she got, so to speak, the wrong answer, the weak answer instead of the strong answer.

614
00:46:11,841 --> 00:46:14,641
But let me go on and make my case more.

615
00:46:14,961 --> 00:46:18,240
So Michelle and Patricia are not in the same world.

616
00:46:18,801 --> 00:46:23,841
Sorry, Michelle and that girl who has no name are not in the same world.

617
00:46:23,841 --> 00:46:29,040
Neither Michelle, and Michelle and Patricia are not in that world, her world, the old world.

618
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:37,040
They are in the after-God is dead world, and they're attracted to each other from the opposite ends of the dimension of nothingness.

619
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:44,361
You can either take it with courage, cheerfulness, and energy, or with cowardice, disgruntlement, and apathy.

620
00:46:40,321 --> 00:46:46,040
They're like magnets.

621
00:46:47,481 --> 00:46:54,121
The negative and the positive attract each other on the same dimension, but at opposite ends.

622
00:46:55,241 --> 00:47:03,000
Even though she's utterly joyless and lost, she has more in common with Michelle than with the girl who still lives under the old values.

623
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,601
What Michelle likes about Patricia is that she shares his nihilism.

624
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:13,561
That is, she's more like him than like anyone else in the movie.

625
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:18,440
And now you can sort of, let's talk about the kind of things they share.

626
00:47:19,401 --> 00:47:25,080
They share a kind of poetry of non-explanations.

627
00:47:25,401 --> 00:47:28,040
There's a kind of poetry where the why is lacking.

628
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,040
You recognize what I'm talking about?

629
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,240
Why are you sad?

630
00:47:31,241 --> 00:47:32,441
Because I'm sad.

631
00:47:32,441 --> 00:47:33,640
Why do you look at me?

632
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,161
Because I look at you.

633
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:55,801
And all events are explained in terms of that nihilistic poetry, which, in fact, Godard or the scenario writer, I don't know who, says, Michelle says, as if reciting a poem, when she says it's bad to be an informer, he says, this is top of 124.

634
00:47:55,801 --> 00:47:56,920
No, it's normal.

635
00:47:56,921 --> 00:48:00,761
Informers inform, burglars burgle, lovers love.

636
00:48:00,761 --> 00:48:04,121
Look, the Place de la Concorde is so beautiful.

637
00:48:04,441 --> 00:48:07,481
And in other words, and she does it too.

638
00:48:07,481 --> 00:48:13,640
I mean, they both share the nothing ever happens because of anything.

639
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,241
There are no motives.

640
00:48:15,241 --> 00:48:18,121
There's no sort of economic causes.

641
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:25,481
Burglars don't burgle because they choose to burgle or because they come from families of burglars or because they need milk for their children.

642
00:48:25,921 --> 00:48:29,520
Burglars burgle just because that's what they do.

643
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,520
And that's what she shares with him.

644
00:48:34,801 --> 00:48:39,761
And she also shares with him that all meaningful distinctions are leveled.

645
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,880
So for instance, she says, should I say tou or vous to you?

646
00:48:44,881 --> 00:48:48,560
In French, that's the intimate or the formal.

647
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,801
In German, like do and z.

648
00:48:51,120 --> 00:49:01,040
And you say tou to somebody that you're intimate with and love, or to your children who you're intimate with and love, and you say vou to people you're formal with and polite.

649
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,361
And it's a huge difference in French.

650
00:49:03,361 --> 00:49:06,000
You mess it up, you really mess things up.

651
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,040
And the answer he says is, it doesn't matter, they're equal.

652
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:18,080
The most extreme might be when he says, I want to make love to you because you're so beautiful, and she said, oh, I'm not beautiful, in 76.

653
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,640
And he says, okay, because you're so ugly.

654
00:49:21,841 --> 00:49:23,681
It doesn't matter.

655
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,481
No distinctions matter.

656
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:34,161
There are no explanations, and there are no meaningful distinctions, and nothing means anything.

657
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,361
There are no moral guidelines, and so forth and so forth.

658
00:49:37,361 --> 00:49:40,801
What Michelle likes about her is that she sees it.

659
00:49:40,801 --> 00:49:44,241
What he dislikes about her is that she doesn't enjoy it.

660
00:49:44,241 --> 00:49:51,760
That's the fact he says it drives him crazy that she does things by half-measures that destroys his morale.

661
00:49:51,761 --> 00:49:54,881
I couldn't find the quote, but I know it's in here somewhere.

662
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:01,520
So Michelle enjoys, I'm repeating myself, the nothingness and turns it into poetry.

663
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,601
Patricia just salts and wishes she could think of something positive.

664
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,280
Now, let's see.

665
00:50:07,281 --> 00:50:13,961
I have one here which I think I've sort of jumped ahead and done already, so I'm going to skip it to make sure we've got it in time to do everything.

666
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:23,640
Okay, we're going to skip to Patricia's encounter with the famous author, the press conference, which is so amazing.

667
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:28,201
They ask him all these stupid questions and he gives all these stupid answers.

668
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:39,161
And at one point, he compliments her, which is when a question is asked by a girl with white beautiful hair and a beautiful striped sweater or something like that.

669
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:45,161
And of course, she loves that because that fits her narcissism.

670
00:50:45,801 --> 00:50:52,441
And she has this rapt expression when the author compliments her.

671
00:50:52,441 --> 00:50:57,481
But now comes the absolutely crucialest thing, I think, for understanding the movie.

672
00:50:57,481 --> 00:51:06,601
She asks him what would be the actually perfect question for somebody who is living in the nothing and doesn't like it.

673
00:51:06,841 --> 00:51:10,040
In effect, how do you get out of meaninglessness?

674
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:15,000
She says, what is your greatest ambition?

675
00:51:15,401 --> 00:51:20,921
And I hope you remember what he said, because it turns out to be very important, I think.

676
00:51:21,241 --> 00:51:22,841
What does he say to her?

677
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,921
He says, where is it?

678
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:30,361
What is your greatest ambition in life?

679
00:51:30,361 --> 00:51:34,280
And he says, to become immortal and then to die.

680
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:39,721
And the important thing is not what he said, but how she takes it.

681
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:53,721
You get immediately the music, when the Michelle music comes up, you get a perfect front-face picture of her, and she's looking absolutely dazed or stunned or something like that.

682
00:51:54,281 --> 00:51:56,080
I'll read what the directions say.

683
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:06,000
Michelle's music comes in, she takes off her sunglasses, puts the end of the earpiece in her mouth, and slowly turns to stare straight into the camera.

684
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:15,281
And that, okay, we don't know yet why that's important, but the way it's set up, it's clearly something important is happening there.

685
00:52:15,281 --> 00:52:27,600
She's either totally unable to understand what happened, or she's got glimmer that somebody's got some understanding about meaning that she has no clue about, but she'd like to know.

686
00:52:27,921 --> 00:52:30,321
But you have to put it aside now.

687
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,321
It's not relevant yet.

688
00:52:32,321 --> 00:52:34,321
But that's when it happens.

689
00:52:34,321 --> 00:52:36,961
Okay, now we've got to go to the next issue.

690
00:52:36,961 --> 00:52:38,160
Anybody want to say anything?

691
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,641
We're still doing okay.

692
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,720
So if you do, you go ahead and say it.

693
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,360
Yeah.

694
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,601
Absolutely identical.

695
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,361
And so is the music.

696
00:52:47,361 --> 00:52:49,281
That's why that's important.

697
00:52:49,281 --> 00:52:54,080
That's why you've got to take seriously what he said to become immortal and then die.

698
00:52:54,401 --> 00:52:55,120
Yes.

699
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,921
But now what that's going to mean when we get there, I'm not ready to say.

700
00:52:59,921 --> 00:53:07,121
The end is so subtle and so interesting and so ambiguous that we don't know yet.

701
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:18,241
Okay, but we have to know before the end, because it's important for understanding the end, what is her motivation for turning him in, which seems such a strange thing to do.

702
00:53:18,801 --> 00:53:41,720
Well, it turns out it starts, well, first you should remember that, and you don't realize it unless you've seen the film at least once first, that all their kisses have been completely meaningless, sort of pushing their mouths up against each other and rubbing their noses together under when they're in bed together in the hotel room, and when they're, I think, maybe once somewhere else.

703
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:44,520
I'm sure somewhere else, but I can't remember where.

704
00:53:44,841 --> 00:53:46,841
But where?

705
00:53:48,921 --> 00:53:53,000
Oh, yeah, and she gives him a kiss, that's right, when they first meet and run across the street.

706
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,321
Well, those kisses are non-kisses, that's sure.

707
00:53:57,321 --> 00:54:16,601
And all of a sudden, for reasons you have to help figure out, but I think I know, on page 123, when she reads in the newspaper that he's been married, which isn't important, and he says, I dumped her or she dumped me, I don't remember anymore.

708
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:20,441
An example of forgetting and leveling that Nietzsche would have liked.

709
00:54:20,441 --> 00:54:25,641
She says, All of a sudden, I love you very much enormously, Michelle.

710
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,561
Now, what's happening?

711
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:33,160
Well, and Michelle says, How do you feel riding in a stolen car?

712
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:36,520
And she says, And you when you killed the policeman, and so forth.

713
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,361
What has she discovered?

714
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:42,840
Well, she's discovered that he's killed a policeman.

715
00:54:42,841 --> 00:54:45,561
Now, why is that so important to her?

716
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:50,040
That she can tell him that it lets her love him enormously.

717
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:57,160
That is, though they've never kissed passionately before in the movie house, they do while they're watching the movie.

718
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:03,321
It's an entirely different kind of kiss because she's now accepting that she loves him enormously.

719
00:55:03,321 --> 00:55:04,921
And what's the point?

720
00:55:04,921 --> 00:55:08,520
Is it the heroism, the risk, the excitement?

721
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,441
No, certainly not.

722
00:55:10,441 --> 00:55:12,761
It's that he has to leave.

723
00:55:12,761 --> 00:55:19,561
She knows now that he won't be able to stay with her in Paris.

724
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:22,120
And that's good news.

725
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,720
Now, why that's good news?

726
00:55:24,361 --> 00:55:25,680
You can begin to glimmer.

727
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:31,361
That lets her love him completely, like on the last night before he's going to surely leave.

728
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:37,121
It's like Yvonne saying people should only be intimate with each other when they know they're going to leave the next day.

729
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,680
That she's got the same view.

730
00:55:40,961 --> 00:55:49,921
So otherwise, it would hamper her negative kind of freedom.

731
00:55:49,921 --> 00:55:52,081
It would demand a commitment from her.

732
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,921
She would risk being hurt.

733
00:55:53,921 --> 00:55:58,241
She says earlier on, I want to love you, and I don't want you to love me.

734
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,121
I want you to love me, and I don't want you to love me.

735
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,481
I want my freedom.

736
00:56:02,481 --> 00:56:04,481
I'm very independent, you know.

737
00:56:04,481 --> 00:56:05,200
86.

738
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,841
A negative kind of independence, of course.

739
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:20,800
An independence that says that says, in effect, that she doesn't want anything, even a brief habit in her life.

740
00:56:22,801 --> 00:56:33,520
So she panics when she realizes that he's got a plan that actually he could put into effect of going to, that they could go to Italy together.

741
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:37,520
They're going to have a car, they're going to be given money, and so forth.

742
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:47,520
At that moment, when he says, Buretti, or whatever his friend is, we're going to get a car, we're going to get money, we're going to go to Italy, she leaves to go call the police.

743
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:52,081
That's just the worst thing that she could possibly imagine could happen to her.

744
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:55,201
That she would lose this negative kind of freedom.

745
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,680
She wants him to leave her alone, she says.

746
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,680
She wants people to leave her alone, she says.

747
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:04,000
I didn't find that quote either, but she does say that.

748
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,040
I thought I had that.

749
00:57:06,321 --> 00:57:08,080
Well, anyway, she says that.

750
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:14,040
And, of course, you've got to add this, or you can't understand the ending.

751
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,361
She doesn't think he's going to be killed.

752
00:57:16,361 --> 00:57:20,921
She doesn't think he's going to be captured by the police and get life imprisonment.

753
00:57:20,921 --> 00:57:23,241
There isn't capital punishment, friends.

754
00:57:23,241 --> 00:57:26,040
Can you imagine Michelle Clotar with life imprisonment?

755
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,281
I mean, that would be pretty terrible.

756
00:57:28,281 --> 00:57:30,040
But of course, she doesn't expect that.

757
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,520
She expects that he'll leave instantly.

758
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:36,280
And he just lies there listening to the clarinet quintet.

759
00:57:36,281 --> 00:57:44,840
And then they have this amazing conversation in which they don't talk to each other, but each one sort of says the kind of soliloquy and counterpoint.

760
00:57:44,841 --> 00:57:47,081
But he doesn't leave.

761
00:57:47,401 --> 00:57:52,681
So now that is what happens next?

762
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:56,921
Well, next is, or you believe that, don't you?

763
00:57:56,921 --> 00:58:06,361
I mean, it's pretty clear with her talk about wanting to be free and not wanting people to depend on her or not wanting any, obviously not wanting any commitments.

764
00:58:06,361 --> 00:58:19,000
It fits her negative kind of nihilism, and it makes perfect sense of what is otherwise incomprehensible, why she would run out and turn him in after just because she says she loves him tremendously.

765
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:25,641
But it's just because she now admits to him and herself that she loves him, that she has to get rid of him.

766
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,361
But not hurt him.

767
00:58:28,361 --> 00:58:31,561
And that's what she sets out to do by calling the police.

768
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:33,721
But of course, this isn't how it works out.

769
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:39,640
Now, it works out, you have to sort of follow everything now, frame by frame, really sort of to follow the plot.

770
00:58:39,961 --> 00:58:47,160
Varudi arrives with the car and the money, the gun, and he doesn't want to take the gun.

771
00:58:47,481 --> 00:58:53,720
And then the police arrive in their car, at which point he reaches over and picks up the gun.

772
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:59,520
As soon as he picks up the gun, and I think he's supposed to know it, they can kill him because he's self-defense.

773
00:58:55,401 --> 00:59:02,880
Without the gun, they could only arrest him and put him in prison for life.

774
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,881
And he doesn't want to go to prison for life, and he's perfectly happy with dying.

775
00:59:06,881 --> 00:59:14,881
So he picks up the gun, and immediately, Vidado, the police, the frantic, sweaty policeman, shoots him.

776
00:59:14,881 --> 00:59:23,361
And then comes this amazingly beautiful ending, which I've seen maybe 20 times, and it still just seems to me incredibly beautiful.

777
00:59:23,361 --> 00:59:36,321
He does this kind of ballet in which he goes staggering down the street, bouncing off the cars, and the people come out and look in a kind of disinterested way at what's going on.

778
00:59:36,321 --> 00:59:43,200
And finally, he gets to the crosswalk at the end of the street, and he decides to fall down.

779
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:48,081
It's clear he doesn't want to get out in the street where he'll get squished by a car.

780
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:51,361
He wants to die on his own terms.

781
00:59:51,361 --> 00:59:53,600
So he throws himself down.

782
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,680
You can see by the way, he puts his feet up in the air.

783
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,601
I mean, he doesn't just collapse.

784
00:59:58,881 --> 01:00:02,721
He falls down intentionally in the crosswalk.

785
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,240
And then, what else?

786
01:00:05,361 --> 01:00:13,681
He does his sort of heroic, bogey death, which is he's in complete control of everything.

787
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:19,600
From he he falls down dramatically.

788
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:27,201
He takes a last puff on his cigarette and throws it away dramatically, giving up smoking forever, obviously.

789
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:39,800
And he then turns to Patricia, who's been following him, and he gives him and she gives him this com beginning of a completely blank look.

790
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,921
But he's not angry at her for turning him in.

791
01:00:43,241 --> 01:00:51,081
And we can see that because he's been looking forward to his death all his life and practicing for it.

792
01:00:51,241 --> 01:00:53,641
Godard understands that.

793
01:00:53,640 --> 01:01:03,081
And he's enjoying this dramatic, so he gives her the three grimaces, or just thanks for getting him killed so nicely.

794
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:11,321
And that is their secret sign that they're both outside the normal and understand each other, or so he thinks.

795
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:23,561
And that is, he wants, I said, he doesn't want to keep a straight, put it this way, he doesn't want to keep a straight face even in the face of death.

796
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:29,880
That's the ultimate seriousness out of which you get a chance to have the ultimate laugh.

797
01:01:29,881 --> 01:01:31,481
And he's having it.

798
01:01:32,361 --> 01:01:37,240
So he turns to her now.

799
01:01:37,241 --> 01:01:44,121
He's just produced a great death, made fun of death and all the sacred things that could go with it.

800
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:47,481
And he turns to her for what?

801
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:51,481
For recognition, presumably, for approval.

802
01:01:51,481 --> 01:01:56,441
She ought to give him these grimaces back.

803
01:01:56,761 --> 01:01:59,721
He's dying with cheerfulness and style.

804
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,520
She should at least applaud.

805
01:02:02,841 --> 01:02:16,761
But she can't understand at all this last act of positive nihilism, since she doesn't, since she's afraid of nothing and afraid of death, and she's guilty of having done this to him, even though she didn't intend to do this to him.

806
01:02:16,761 --> 01:02:18,040
So, what does she do?

807
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:29,601
She looks absolutely blank, stunned and blank, just like she looked when the author said that his aim in life was to become immortal and then die.

808
01:02:29,921 --> 01:02:38,801
So, at that point in the movie, the nihilism that has brought the two of them together pulls them apart.

809
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:50,161
They're now a passive nihilist confronting an active nihilist, and there's nothing now in a kind of pun that they have in common.

810
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:54,160
They have, in effect, nothing in common with a capital N.

811
01:02:54,640 --> 01:03:05,840
They both face the nothing after the death of God, but they have nothing in common in the ordinary meaning, in that their way of dealing with the nothing is totally opposed.

812
01:03:05,841 --> 01:03:11,601
And that's now become finally in the course of the movie, in the end that becomes clear.

813
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:21,921
She doesn't applaud his last great act, and he says, It's revolting, and then closes his eyes.

814
01:03:21,921 --> 01:03:24,881
I'm trying to tell you what I think is revolting.

815
01:03:24,881 --> 01:03:42,481
What's revolting is not her, but that she doesn't understand and applaud his perfectly Nietzschean, Bogartish, active nihilist death.

816
01:03:42,481 --> 01:03:45,360
And she asked the policeman, what did he say?

817
01:03:45,361 --> 01:03:50,801
Well, he, by the way, takes the last tiny bit of control and closes his own eyes.

818
01:03:50,801 --> 01:03:53,441
And then his head falls over.

819
01:03:53,441 --> 01:03:54,561
He's dead.

820
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:58,721
And then she asked the policeman, what did he say?

821
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:05,681
And the policeman says, he said, she's disgusting.

822
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:15,000
Because the policeman, naturally, like you or me, normally, wouldn't understand what in the world he could possibly be disgusted by, except for her turning him in.

823
01:04:10,321 --> 01:04:16,200
But it isn't that.

824
01:04:16,761 --> 01:04:21,401
It's what he said was what she's doing is disgusting.

825
01:04:21,401 --> 01:04:24,601
Or better yet, really, what she's not doing.

826
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,801
is disgusting.

827
01:04:25,801 --> 01:04:46,440
It's that disgusting, by the way, is the same word that way back on page 62, I noticed at this time for the first time watching the movie, and it's totally messed up in the translation, when he sees, when she leaves him to go see the journalist way back, he says, okay, beat it, beat it, you bitch.

828
01:04:46,441 --> 01:04:47,961
But it isn't you, bitch.

829
01:04:47,961 --> 01:04:51,321
It's to Degilas again.

830
01:04:51,321 --> 01:04:54,200
And that is you disgusting person.

831
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,880
And so the word, again, it's important.

832
01:04:57,881 --> 01:04:59,160
It's not a scumbag.

833
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,040
It's not a bitch.

834
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:05,320
It's something that somehow what she's doing is disgusting.

835
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,481
Then, and now why?

836
01:05:07,801 --> 01:05:10,040
Well, what happens next?

837
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,561
And it isn't over yet.

838
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:13,081
She looks stunned.

839
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,761
She looks blank.

840
01:05:15,321 --> 01:05:20,841
You can't say she looks sad or shocked or not even shocked, just stunned and blank.

841
01:05:20,841 --> 01:05:25,401
And then she makes the gesture, the bogey gesture.

842
01:05:25,401 --> 01:05:32,361
And you get the same full face picture of her as he says, and you get the same music on the soundtrack.

843
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:34,040
What's happening there?

844
01:05:34,361 --> 01:05:37,801
Well, is she just looking blank?

845
01:05:37,801 --> 01:05:41,481
Or now you have to ask the same question with the journalist.

846
01:05:41,481 --> 01:05:49,961
When that happens, that somebody says something she can't understand, is it that she just can't understand?

847
01:05:49,961 --> 01:05:53,561
Or is it she's beginning to comprehend some new idea?

848
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,240
What would be the new idea?

849
01:05:55,761 --> 01:06:13,120
Well, the new idea would be that Bogey became immortal and died and passed the gesture on to him, and he is now becoming immortal and dying and passing the gesture on to her, which means the beginning of her transformation into an active nihilist.

850
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,881
I mean, that's one possible reading.

851
01:06:14,881 --> 01:06:16,961
It's totally ambiguous.

852
01:06:16,961 --> 01:06:19,040
Or it means she didn't get it.

853
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:26,641
But of course, that fact that she makes that gesture makes you think she must have gotten something from him.

854
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:31,601
And all she could get from him would be to be an active nihilist.

855
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:34,561
But Godard's not telling you, and that's nice.

856
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:39,361
He's just, she just turns her back to the camera, and that's it.

857
01:06:39,361 --> 01:06:44,801
You're left with these two possibilities, and you don't know what to think.

858
01:06:44,801 --> 01:06:46,881
At least, I don't know what to think.

859
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,760
If anybody does know what to think, I'm ready to hear.

860
01:06:49,761 --> 01:06:50,241
Yeah.

861
01:06:50,560 --> 01:07:02,801
The Missens Representation actually adds the same thing, like people in the nothingness and saying, like, all this stuff, and this is what it is.

862
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:04,240
And her teaching is.

863
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,720
Well, I don't see why it would.

864
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:10,961
I mean, he's certainly saying, I don't think he's saying death is nothing.

865
01:07:10,961 --> 01:07:13,121
He's certainly not saying it's meaningful.

866
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:22,641
It's an occasion for a free spirit to do a creative and powerful thing.

867
01:07:23,761 --> 01:07:28,240
Death is important, he wouldn't be thinking about it all his life if it was trivial.

868
01:07:28,241 --> 01:07:30,000
It's not trivial at all.

869
01:07:30,001 --> 01:07:35,280
It's how to make the most out of the most you can out of the most nothing there is.

870
01:07:35,281 --> 01:07:36,640
And that's what he did.

871
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:37,280
Yeah.

872
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,840
Why would he want recognition?

873
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:44,680
I guess Dyke would say because he cares about her.

874
01:07:45,001 --> 01:07:47,481
Who's the one who said we should talk to each other?

875
01:07:47,481 --> 01:07:51,241
I mean, he's open and he cares.

876
01:07:51,241 --> 01:07:52,680
She's his brief habit.

877
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:59,720
And he really wants her to, you know, applaud him and appreciate him in his last great act.

878
01:08:00,441 --> 01:08:01,800
That's what I think.

879
01:08:02,281 --> 01:08:02,920
Yeah.

880
01:08:03,241 --> 01:08:07,080
I've got a little confirmed reading down there as a free spirit.

881
01:08:09,161 --> 01:08:10,520
That is cheerfulness, isn't he?

882
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:11,081
Cheerful?

883
01:08:11,081 --> 01:08:13,560
I mean, he's about what?

884
01:08:14,201 --> 01:08:16,600
But one point, a good point to pick that out.

885
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:17,640
That's very sensitive.

886
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,000
He says, I'm tired.

887
01:08:19,241 --> 01:08:19,960
I know.

888
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:21,960
I don't know what to make of that.

889
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:23,481
So that's why I didn't bring it up.

890
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:27,401
It seems to me I have two reactions.

891
01:08:27,401 --> 01:08:34,280
One, it seems sort of psychologically, perfectly sensible for him to say it, since he's been fleeing from the police for the whole movie.

892
01:08:34,281 --> 01:08:39,161
But it doesn't seem like the right ontological, the right philosophical thing for him to say.

893
01:08:39,161 --> 01:08:40,280
That's what you're on to.

894
01:08:40,281 --> 01:08:50,920
I mean, it looks like the free spirit would never be sort of spiritually exhausted and ready to sleep.

895
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:58,280
And so it looks to me like it's sort of plausible in the plot, but not the right thing for him to say.

896
01:08:58,281 --> 01:08:59,081
Of course it is.

897
01:08:59,081 --> 01:08:59,880
That's what I said.

898
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:04,361
It was a pop punk version of a free spirit.

899
01:09:04,361 --> 01:09:12,120
It's certainly, one way to see it, which I never said before, but I found myself saying a little while back, he's certainly not opening up new worlds.

900
01:09:12,121 --> 01:09:16,040
And that might be the way to put the fact that he's not really a free spirit.

901
01:09:16,041 --> 01:09:22,040
Free spirits don't just do funny things like pick up girls' skirts and so forth.

902
01:09:22,041 --> 01:09:30,880
Free spirits have new suns, new worlds, what are all these things, new whatevers, and he doesn't have a new anything.

903
01:09:31,201 --> 01:09:35,281
So, in a certain way, he's got only sort of half a free spirit.

904
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:36,481
Yeah, I can say something.

905
01:09:36,481 --> 01:09:38,640
He's always tired, doesn't he?

906
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,680
Yeah, but he doesn't think he's weak and being cleansed.

907
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:46,960
That's the problem.

908
01:09:46,960 --> 01:10:00,160
I do think it means that he's ready to die, but he's been ready to die all through the movie, and that's why it's a little strange for him to say here he's tired.

909
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,321
Dave's brought up a good question.

910
01:10:04,321 --> 01:10:06,080
I don't really know.

911
01:10:06,081 --> 01:10:16,880
I'm afraid my way of reading it would have to be to say that's, as I said, thought-wise and psychologically, perfectly natural thing for him to be tired and want to sleep.

912
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:24,960
But it shouldn't be that his sort of, I don't know, cheerfulness and power were running down.

913
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:34,240
Although, I suppose you could put the two together and say, even a free spirit, after all, gets exhausted after they've been running long enough.

914
01:10:34,241 --> 01:10:37,201
Yeah, he was willing to go to prison with his girlfriend.

915
01:10:37,201 --> 01:10:42,800
You mean in that story about what would happen if he went to Italy or when he does say that?

916
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,240
What does he say?

917
01:10:44,401 --> 01:10:45,520
Let's look, let's look.

918
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:51,120
No, I don't think he says that, but when this, I'm reading it now, talk about myself.

919
01:10:51,121 --> 01:10:52,800
They don't want to be in love.

920
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:57,760
She says, Just, it's, I don't, she says, I don't want to be in love with you.

921
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,201
That's why I called the police.

922
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:02,960
I'm just looking into things and so forth.

923
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,081
Yeah, well, okay, somewhere it says, why aren't you leaving?

924
01:11:06,081 --> 01:11:06,720
Let's see.

925
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,720
She says, I'm independent.

926
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:09,520
I wish people.

927
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:10,000
That's what she says.

928
01:11:10,081 --> 01:11:12,200
I wish people would leave me alone.

929
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:16,200
And then she says, now you're forced to leave.

930
01:11:16,201 --> 01:11:18,200
All this is important to read.

931
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:22,040
He says, why don't you leave, Michelle?

932
01:11:22,041 --> 01:11:23,401
You mustn't count on me.

933
01:11:23,401 --> 01:11:24,760
Leave, Michelle.

934
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:26,361
What are you waiting for?

935
01:11:26,361 --> 01:11:29,800
And now he should say something about, yeah, he says, ah, you're right.

936
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,880
Here he says, no, I'm staying.

937
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:35,720
If any way I feel like going to prison, she says, you're crazy.

938
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:37,720
Yes, no one will talk to me.

939
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:39,160
I'll look at the walls.

940
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:41,640
You see, you said that.

941
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:42,281
I don't know.

942
01:11:42,281 --> 01:11:44,280
They say funny things to each other.

943
01:11:44,281 --> 01:11:47,640
And then he says, oh, shit, Baratti, and he runs out.

944
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,160
The car is arriving.

945
01:11:49,161 --> 01:11:54,280
Just when they're reaching some kind of understanding, I guess, about it's okay for him to go to prison.

946
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,640
And then that goes, you're right.

947
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:59,241
That goes with him saying he's tired.

948
01:11:59,241 --> 01:12:02,441
That doesn't seem like the proper free spirit attitude.

949
01:12:02,441 --> 01:12:08,920
Well, I'm just going to say that he'd rather die than go to prison.

950
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:11,160
He is ready to go to prison.

951
01:12:11,161 --> 01:12:12,361
Maybe that's okay.

952
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:14,441
Maybe he can even be cheerful in prison.

953
01:12:14,441 --> 01:12:15,401
I just don't know.

954
01:12:15,401 --> 01:12:18,920
But I can't leave it out, but I don't know what to do with it.

955
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:19,880
He and then you.

956
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:20,281
Yeah.

957
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:23,640
Yes, you don't feel, and that's both of you are on the right track.

958
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:31,880
I said something wrong in the sense that I said that he knew that he didn't want to go to prison and for life, that he would prefer to be shot.

959
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:35,800
I think if you sort of ask him, he might know that.

960
01:12:36,201 --> 01:12:37,321
But he doesn't have it.

961
01:12:37,321 --> 01:12:41,241
He doesn't think that because it's somehow a kind of afterthought that he picks up.

962
01:12:41,241 --> 01:12:42,920
It's not clear why he picks up the gun.

963
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:48,040
It's certainly, but it isn't as if he picks it up in order to have a shootout with the police.

964
01:12:48,041 --> 01:12:51,161
He just looks like somehow he just doesn't think.

965
01:12:51,161 --> 01:12:51,960
He just picks it up.

966
01:12:52,041 --> 01:12:52,760
That's what you think?

967
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:54,520
That's how I picture it in the movie.

968
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:57,600
Okay, well, so, but that isn't a big disaster for me.

969
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:06,640
I mean, I think that what he does is get shot, and that's, and he doesn't mind getting shot.

970
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,640
In fact, it turns out to be an opportunity.

971
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:09,760
Yeah, we got one more minute.

972
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:10,800
I saw a hand over here.

973
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,560
Yeah, last comment.

974
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:13,920
Good, good, I like it.

975
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:20,160
He says, because clear it up the fact that he lived on impulse, and then we could end it with, and why does he pick up the gun?

976
01:13:20,161 --> 01:13:22,960
Because people who see guns lying on the street pick up guns.

977
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:27,040
It's sort of, don't give it, don't ask for a why at that point.

978
01:13:27,041 --> 01:13:27,520
Okay.
