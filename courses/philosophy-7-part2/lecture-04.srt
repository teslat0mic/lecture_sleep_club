00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
And now that's the perfect transition to what I want to talk about, because that's where we are about resisting it.

2
00:00:07,199 --> 00:00:10,080
Well, I have to do another thing before two things before I get there.

3
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:25,359
Remember, I'll remind you that we're going to get to the point where the Knight of Resignation has all kinds of possible free maneuvers to make to resist getting into this vulnerable situation.

4
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,240
But two things.

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,120
One, you may have noticed, and I just sort of thought that he was going to bring it up.

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,959
That's why it flashed in my mind.

7
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:33,319
And I'm happy he didn't.

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,680
And I shouldn't probably.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,719
But just you must be sort of uneasy about how this maps on the Abraham-Isaac story.

10
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,319
And I'm not talking about God and Abraham and commands to kill Isaac at all.

11
00:00:45,319 --> 00:00:51,959
That's because I, one, first, I think that's not a big deal issue in the preamble.

12
00:00:51,959 --> 00:01:00,519
It's a big deal issue in the ethical why Abraham's trying to kill Isaac and why that's a good thing or a bad thing and what and so forth.

13
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:01,880
That's important.

14
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:07,960
But don't my feeling about this is get the phenomena straight first.

15
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:10,120
Find the revealing experience.

16
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:22,759
Go through all those nine different characteristics of it, for instance, and then, and I, by that way, I promised somebody that I would put the nine characteristics on a handout.

17
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:25,959
And then I discovered I had filled this handout.

18
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:33,480
So you'll have another handout next time in which I put down those nine characteristics of a defining commitment.

19
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:47,240
But when just when, and so get a good grip on the phenomenon before and its implications before you try to make sense of everything in the book.

20
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:58,680
Sooner or later, we're going to have to ask whether the Abraham-Isaac story really works very well with the Regina story and works very well with the defining commitment story and so forth.

21
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,360
But it is confusing and dizzying, and the best thing is just not to worry about it yet.

22
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,120
Yeah, Beatrice.

23
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,120
Yes, I keep putting the handouts on the webpage.

24
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,799
I haven't put the nine, I don't know whether I put the nine features yet, but I will.

25
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,480
Yes, if you don't get it here, but there were enough here, weren't there?

26
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,160
Did we run out?

27
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,919
I do have the hands out from last time.

28
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,520
But you always can find them and print them, but they're theirs last time.

29
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:34,719
Anybody, who needs the handout from last time about the Greek versus the Hebrew?

30
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,400
Just put your hands up.

31
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,280
Okay, now I'm back to things I want to talk about.

32
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:42,960
And here goes.

33
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:56,240
I have to get some interesting issue out of the way before we can discuss what the main subject for today is, all the various moves of resignation and why they don't work.

34
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:04,880
But before that, I want to discuss a special one that you really have to get off the table, or you won't understand anything else.

35
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,560
So let's review first.

36
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:09,040
So you've got an unconditional commitment.

37
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:20,160
And to make your life fully meaningful, it's got to be for something finite and temporal that gives you not only an identity, but day-to-day meaning in your life.

38
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,840
But if it's concrete enough to give you day-by-day meaning, then it's vulnerable.

39
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,039
Remember my example.

40
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:40,160
I mean, if Martin Luther King just thinks that justice ought to come to the black people sometime, and he gives sermons on that and so forth, then that isn't enough to get him out of bed in the morning if it's a cold, rainy day.

41
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,240
It doesn't matter what he does.

42
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,400
Sooner or later, God will get justice for the black people.

43
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:50,240
That's not a commitment that's finite and temporal enough.

44
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:59,320
He has to think justice for these people in the United States now, before I die, that is.

45
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,280
And if he has that, then he knows what he has to do every minute when he gets up out of bed.

46
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:08,120
He has to get up out of bed and plant his peace marches, rain or shine.

47
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:18,840
But it's that thing of making it finite and temporal so that every moment he has something meaningful to do in his life, which also makes it vulnerable.

48
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:28,759
If it's safe enough to not be vulnerable, it's empty enough and general enough and formal enough not to make everything meaningful.

49
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:42,200
My other example is in the old days, the committed, the communists who were committed to the ultimate triumph of the proletariat, but not necessarily their proletariat in their country and not necessarily now.

50
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,960
That isn't enough.

51
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,160
And if you're really committed to a revolution right now in your country, that's very vulnerable.

52
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:51,159
Okay, so that's the first thing.

53
00:04:52,759 --> 00:05:06,279
And so Kierkegaard thinks that through a defining commitment to something finite and temporal, then you get an eternal lifelong commitment, and that gives you German a life full meaning.

54
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,560
And another way that it's vulnerable and dangerous is it might require you to die for it.

55
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:20,360
We said that you might die, the cause or the other person might die, all kinds of bad things could happen.

56
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:32,920
And is there any way of keeping meaning and keeping this strong kind of meaning and identity in your life and not be vulnerable?

57
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:35,080
And the answer is going to be no.

58
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:55,759
There are lots of moves in the philosophies of the world and the religions of the world and specific moves in the history of the West trying to have this thing that I said, one student asked me at the end, not last time, but time before, but isn't there some way to keep the meaning and not have the vulnerability?

59
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,520
And the answer is no, from Kierkegaard's point of view.

60
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:08,960
And in the world of the spirit, you have to have the risk in order to have the fulfillment.

61
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:20,240
One strange way he puts it is on 57, where he's talking about how in the world of the spirit, everything is you get what you deserve, so to speak.

62
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,960
And a little below the middle of 57.

63
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,160
Only one who knows anguish finds rest.

64
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:29,280
Only one who draws the knife gets Isaac.

65
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:49,840
That means, roughly, anyone, only those who live in the realization that all their life and their meaning and their identity and everything is not under their control, and yet it could be taken away at any moment, only they can have a full life.

66
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,200
That's getting the bread, of having a fulfilling life.

67
00:06:54,559 --> 00:07:10,160
So only those who take the risk get the bliss and the eternal life, meaning the forever in their life, which can't be reinterpreted and gives them a sense, makes their life worth living, you could say.

68
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:18,800
And now comes, I had to say all that in order to say, but what about the people who believe in an afterlife?

69
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,480
Some of you, I presume, Christians certainly have for a long time.

70
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:33,399
And Kierkegaard's a Christian, you might think that you would think, I mean, after all, if you're a Christian theologian are completely, fanatically Lutheran.

71
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:37,960
And yet, he doesn't believe in the afterlife.

72
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,800
And if he, because if he did, of course, he wouldn't be having all these problems.

73
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:53,080
You could just say, well, we'll meet in the next life, so don't worry so much about the fact that you've lost your Beatrice in this life.

74
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,639
And that's how Dante has it.

75
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:56,919
Beatrice is always around.

76
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:06,040
Beatrice comes back to help Dante, even though she died, because she's been there all the time in eternity.

77
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:14,280
But the crucial passage is on 53, which is before your reading, but it's so important that we have to go back and read it.

78
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,120
The bottom of 53.

79
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,320
This is Kierkegaard making a move.

80
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,280
He doesn't say there isn't any afterlife.

81
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,679
You'll see the same move in Dostoevsky.

82
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:36,360
He's going to say that whether or not there's an afterlife isn't going to help us any with the existential problems involved in living a full time in this life.

83
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,639
And here's how he says it: But Abraham had faith.

84
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:41,800
He had faith for this life.

85
00:08:41,799 --> 00:09:02,360
Yes, had his faith been for a future life, he would indeed have been, it would have indeed been easy to cast everything aside and hasten out of this world to which he did not belong or go join your loved one in eternity, that kind of eternity, not eternity in time, but eternity out of time.

86
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:10,600
But Abraham's faith was not of that kind, if there is such, for faith like that is not really faith, but only its remotest possibility.

87
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:19,600
That means it has a sense that somehow you ought to be able to be vulnerable and safe at the same time, but it doesn't really understand.

88
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,600
A faith that has some inkling of its object at the very edge of its field of vision.

89
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,000
Somehow, that's getting the bread.

90
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:37,120
Somehow, if you did it right, you could have a life that took on vulnerability and was secure at the same time.

91
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:44,960
And they realize that, these people who believe in the afterlife, but they think that it can only happen later.

92
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,800
So now let's go on.

93
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:58,560
So they have an inkling of this kind of bliss, but they remain separated from it by a yawning abyss in which despair plays its pranks.

94
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,679
And dominant stop with that, I think, just a second.

95
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,320
Yes.

96
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,960
And what that means, why are they in despair?

97
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,560
It looks like they should be happy if they believe that there's an afterlife.

98
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:21,279
They're in despair in that they have given up hope that they could be completely fulfilled and have a completely life worth living, have a commitment to what's finite and temporal that makes every day important.

99
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,639
They've given all that up and said, well, in this life, no, you can't do that.

100
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,759
It's unfortunate but not very good life.

101
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,519
But in the next life, that's going to be all fixed.

102
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:37,759
And that's despair because this is the main life you've got right now.

103
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:48,880
And if you go through it all, thinking that you can't have meaning and fulfillment now, you're in a kind of despair, even if you think that later you can.

104
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,559
That's his view about that.

105
00:10:50,560 --> 00:11:00,199
And that means that, so that way of getting a fulfillment by that belief, you've got to just cancel when you read Kierkegaard.

106
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:11,319
There's a necessary connection for Kierkegaard between unconditional commitments, which are necessary for a meaningful life, and riskiness and vulnerability.

107
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,439
And you can't, there's no way to dodge it.

108
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:16,600
And all religions try to dodge it.

109
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,120
I think I said maybe Buddhism says non-attachment.

110
00:11:20,439 --> 00:11:30,040
I had this, all kinds of, all mystical views are not facing the need for something finite and temporal.

111
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:50,600
I had this weird experience when I was teaching this long ago when I first came out here, and there was a big TM movement was very strong, and I had several very high-level TM people in the course, and they convinced me I had to go and listen to the sort of speech of the people and join TM.

112
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,760
How many know what transcendental meditation is?

113
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,800
I trust you've all seen some reference to it somewhere.

114
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,039
Anyway, and I did it, and I thought it was interesting.

115
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:09,799
And then we saw a video of Maharisha Yoga, the man who's Baha'i, who's the founder of this way of doing meditation and so forth.

116
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:25,639
And he said his whole speech was sitting there holding a rose and saying, if you follow my way of life, you can have the happiness without the thorns, you could have the rose, which is the happiness without the thorns.

117
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:31,159
You could have the bliss without the suffering and the anguish and the vulnerability.

118
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:33,720
And I thought that was just so absolutely wrong.

119
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:42,999
I was teaching Kierkegaard that when we went around the room and they asked each one what we got out of this, and everybody said, oh, isn't it wonderful, isn't this wonderful possibility?

120
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:53,439
And I said, if the devil himself came back and gave this talk, he would say just that, because he would be undermining Western civilization.

121
00:12:54,159 --> 00:13:02,479
Namely, that detachment and innerness and so forth is not what we're here for.

122
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:04,800
Now, maybe it is what other cultures are here for.

123
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,919
Remember, you are what custom makes you.

124
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:23,039
But Kierkegaard certainly thinks that 2,000 years of Judeo-Christian custom has made us into people who need to have the thorns in order to have the rose.

125
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,239
So that's what it is.

126
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:35,519
But back to what I was saying, but all traditional philosophers make some kind of move that makes meaning safe.

127
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,679
And now we have to look at them, all of them, because they're all interesting.

128
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:52,719
And Kierkegaard mentions all of them at various points in this opening introduction, but not, of course, in any systematic way, because that's not how Kierkegaard writes, particularly when he's upset in Berlin thinking about Regina.

129
00:13:52,719 --> 00:13:59,199
He can write in a much more step-by-step style, but not here.

130
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,880
So anyway, here we go.

131
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,279
Here are the modes of defense.

132
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:09,759
All of these are defenses against the vulnerability of making an unconditional commitment.

133
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:19,999
And the first one is simply to avoid commitments of that, unconditional commitments.

134
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,759
Then you just don't have a defining relation.

135
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:32,759
You don't concentrate the whole content of your life into a single wish.

136
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,239
What have I got here?

137
00:14:28,719 --> 00:14:36,039
Just a second.

138
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:38,040
How to avoid the risk.

139
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,240
Oh, well, I see.

140
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:44,199
Well, first he's going to say what you don't do.

141
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:46,679
But the knight of faith has it.

142
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:56,120
I'm not sure this is the best way to explain it, but I wrote it down this way, and I'm going to follow it because I may have known what I was doing when I wrote it down this way.

143
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:05,959
So the top, the knight has the strength to concentrate the whole of his life's content and the meaning of reality into a single wish.

144
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,399
And then comes the sentence I was wanting to quote.

145
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:15,399
If a person lacks this concentration, this focus, his soul is disintegrated from the start.

146
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:16,760
This is the lowest level.

147
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:18,840
This is lower immediacy.

148
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:26,999
Lower immediacy is so sort of disintegrated and distracted that they don't even focus enough to get an unconditional commitment.

149
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:34,679
And they never come to make the movement to do the unconditional commitment.

150
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:46,600
He, we're talking about this lowest level person, will act prudently in life like those capitalists who invest their capital in every kind of security so that they gain on the one what they lose on the other.

151
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,519
In short, he's not a knight.

152
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:59,159
So the second, so the first stage is lacking a defining commitment at all, and that means not being a knight at all.

153
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,159
And I just want to say one more thing about it.

154
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:05,479
The translation is bad at the top of 72.

155
00:16:05,479 --> 00:16:09,559
And even if you don't notice it, it sort of throws you off.

156
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:15,520
You see anything wrong with concentrating the meaning of reality into a single wish?

157
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,639
Wish is the wrong word.

158
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:24,080
Martin Luther King didn't sit around thinking, wishing that justice would come to the black people.

159
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:32,719
Or the lover doesn't, Dante didn't sit around wishing that Beatrice would always be there in the flesh, so to speak, with him.

160
00:16:34,479 --> 00:16:39,279
What they really are trying to say, what Fierga's trying to say is, in a single commitment.

161
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:45,199
And there is another translation which says, in, let's see, what does it say?

162
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,439
Into a single heart's desire.

163
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:55,840
That must be the sort of Valentine way to describe this romantic commitment.

164
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,280
But it's not a wish.

165
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,159
Heart's desire is supposed to point at something much deeper.

166
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,439
But this character doesn't have that.

167
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:15,120
They are dispersed and they have backup lovers and backup callings.

168
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,479
How many have seen a movie Shampoo, which was around once?

169
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,239
It's a good movie.

170
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:32,880
What's interesting about shampoo, though, nobody ever says it, is that everybody has sort of backup lovers in case something goes wrong with their current relationship and backup jobs in case something goes wrong with their current vocation.

171
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:39,519
It all happens in LA and it seems to be, according to this movie, something about an LA way of life.

172
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:53,279
And those are the people who are lower natures, as he says on 6, oh, sorry, on 72, about 10 lines down in the first full paragraph.

173
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,840
That means two-thirds of the way down on the page.

174
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,719
He says, only lower natures forget themselves and become something new.

175
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:01,000
I read this last time.

176
00:17:58,719 --> 00:18:02,679
The butterfly forgets itself.

177
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,759
The caterpillar can forget that it was a caterpillar when it's a butterfly.

178
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,679
Deeper natures never forget themselves and become something else.

179
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:20,999
Okay, so basically, the lower, so the there's in lower immediacy, you're not an eye, and you don't have this problem, but you don't have any self either.

180
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:21,959
Yeah.

181
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,600
Okay, and what and probably, but I don't know yet.

182
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,039
I have to read where we are.

183
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,360
Where is, okay, here I see, I'm going to skim it.

184
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,799
The paragraph that begins, faith is therefore.

185
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,080
Yeah, let me look at it.

186
00:18:41,639 --> 00:18:50,439
Just to start explaining as we go, an aesthetic emotion is some kind of excitement, like an infatuation.

187
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:53,719
And aesthetic is another name for the lowest level in Hegel.

188
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:55,720
I don't know if it's on the chart that way.

189
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,759
I doubt it.

190
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,919
But aesthetic for him means, no, we don't have it there.

191
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:03,480
But it means, yes, we do.

192
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:08,439
Under Kierkegaard, at least, there is something called aesthetic.

193
00:19:10,439 --> 00:19:12,999
It's a kind of lower immediacy.

194
00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:16,039
It's in the feeling business.

195
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,120
Aesthetic has to do with feeling.

196
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,560
That's why anesthetic means not feeling.

197
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,840
And now it's lucrative.

198
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:30,039
So it's not, and that's the immediate, you notice that inclination of the heart.

199
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,840
But that's not the paradox of existence at all.

200
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,759
Now, let's look at the young girl.

201
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:43,239
If you just have a kind of simple faith that everything will turn out all right, in childlike simplicity and innocence, you haven't got it.

202
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:45,600
You haven't got it because, why?

203
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,760
Because you're missing the vulnerability.

204
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:56,799
You don't see the sword hanging every minute over the head of the beloved in love as if it's the surest thing of all, which is what he says about the knight of faith.

205
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,959
You don't see the sword hanging over the head at all.

206
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:11,520
You're just in total shock, like Regina probably was when this nice bourgeois kid or young man, well, just suddenly broke her engagement and ran off to Berlin.

207
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,760
I mean, that wasn't even conceivable.

208
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,719
It hadn't bothered her that that could happen.

209
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:34,239
So that's just a nicer version rather than the capitalists of somebody who hasn't faced up to the problem at all and therefore doesn't really have an unconditional commitment at all.

210
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:45,679
She has a crush on somebody and she doesn't know, or he has a crush on somebody, and he doesn't know, doesn't even think about the fact that there's any risk involved.

211
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,120
So, okay, so now let's see.

212
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,239
So, there are many strategies for people who are not lower natures.

213
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,959
And now we're going to get those.

214
00:20:54,959 --> 00:21:02,559
Philosophers obviously get you to some kind of mediation which is not lower immediacy and is safe.

215
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:13,840
And there seem to be three different kinds of philosophical ways of making a move that makes things safe.

216
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:33,319
The Greek philosopher, in effect, and this is surprising, forgets the whole thing, forms a defining relation, and then life goes on, and he decides that, really, well, that wasn't really important after all.

217
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:39,479
And the interesting thing is, Kierkegaard thinks that that requires a certain concentration.

218
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:55,159
That is, these aren't just, these philosophers don't just forget it, or like the young girl, never saw the problem, or like the people in shampoo thought that you could make backups of yourself in the situation and not have to face it.

219
00:21:55,159 --> 00:22:05,239
These people make the big deal effort of breaking themselves out of any such commitment, stopping it before it grabs them.

220
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:09,559
And this is what he's talking about on 72.

221
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,959
So the knight makes the movement, the first full paragraph, but what movement?

222
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:15,880
Does he want to forget the whole thing?

223
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,519
Because in that too, there's a kind of concentration.

224
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:26,840
No, the knight doesn't concentrate, can contradict himself, and it would be a contradiction to forget your whole life's content and still be the same.

225
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,959
You recognize that.

226
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:35,159
If it's a defining relation, you can't just forget it, because it makes you the person that you are.

227
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:37,319
Well, what would it be like to forget it?

228
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:41,639
Well, how many, any of you read the symposium, Plato's symposium?

229
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:50,919
Well, it's always interesting because the symposium is a very, very Greek take on romantic love, among other things.

230
00:22:50,919 --> 00:23:03,719
There is a story in the symposium about that all people were round once, and then they got cut in half, and they all go around feeling very wounded and miserable, looking for their other half.

231
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,919
When they find their other half, they hold on to them and hug them and don't want to leave them and so forth.

232
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:16,080
It sounds just, it's a lovely story of romantic love, except that it's told by the comic, it's supposed to be funny.

233
00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:19,199
It's told by Aristophanes, who thinks it's a joke.

234
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,639
And that's very characteristic of this whole approach.

235
00:23:24,639 --> 00:23:26,719
So what does Plato think you should do?

236
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:36,880
Well, he thinks that you should start by loving some particular beautiful body and then understand that after all, beautiful bodies are lots of them around.

237
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,799
And why just get stuck with this one?

238
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,959
So you love all beautiful bodies.

239
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:44,799
And then you realize that inside these beautiful bodies are beautiful souls.

240
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,759
You love one beautiful soul, but then you realize there are others around, so you love all of them.

241
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,080
And then you realize, well, what's going on here?

242
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,519
I really love beauty of bodies and souls.

243
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:01,999
And that's, and once you see that, and you can contemplate pure beauty, Plato thinks.

244
00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:04,559
I never have understood what that would look like or how to do it.

245
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:19,759
But anyway, he thinks when you finally contemplate the beautiful, then you see that all of these attachments to particular beautiful souls and beautiful bodies in all sorts of combinations were petty things.

246
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,199
That's the important thing.

247
00:24:21,199 --> 00:24:23,039
You leave them behind.

248
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:25,360
That's what the forgetting of the whole thing.

249
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,199
You see that all the individual relationships were of small account.

250
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:34,239
And in other words, nothing was really lost.

251
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,959
The individual was never really important.

252
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:38,959
There's never been any suffering.

253
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:44,479
There's just been better and better and better, that is safer and safer and safer fulfillments.

254
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,840
That's what the symposium tells you.

255
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,120
Now, then I'm going to, the next, that's number one.

256
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,319
That's the Greek philosopher, Plato, Symposium.

257
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,199
Now, there's another one which I can't talk about yet.

258
00:24:57,199 --> 00:25:00,279
That would be the tragic hero.

259
00:24:58,719 --> 00:25:04,920
You will read about the tragic hero and Agamemnon.

260
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:06,440
That's not in your reading yet, is it?

261
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:07,399
I don't think so, right?

262
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:09,000
It's in Problem 1, right?

263
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:10,519
Okay, so we won't talk about that.

264
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,880
But there's another one which is just fascinating.

265
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:37,479
And if this, to get a full feeling of what's going on in Kierkegaard and how much he's repudiating the whole sort of mixed mishmash of the Jewish, well, that is Hebrew, Christian, and Greek, which is what happened when they started trying to put the Christian into, the Judeo-Christian, into Greek categories.

266
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:41,719
And I said that Augustine is the first really, really brilliant attempt to do it.

267
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:56,919
And Augustine is a Platonist of sorts, but he's also been somehow transformed by Christianity so that he's not really able to be a normal sort of Platonist.

268
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:06,039
And how it changes him, I'm going to read you passages because he has a beautiful story of a defining commitment and what happens to it.

269
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:12,919
So for the Greek philosopher, it turns out the individual was never significant.

270
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:20,120
What really was desired was always the universal, safe, secure ideal of the beautiful.

271
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:38,679
But from the Christian philosopher, namely Augustine, he sees both that loving an individual would be too risky, and yet, he sees somehow that it's more important than Plato says.

272
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:42,679
He never looks back and says it was just trivial.

273
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:46,080
And how this goes, I'm going to read you passages from the Confessions.

274
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:52,479
This happens to be the edition happily translated by somebody named Pine Coffin.

275
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:55,519
And so I'm going to read that.

276
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,079
Starting on 77 of this, that you won't want to read this.

277
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:12,559
I just want you to read it because I want to read it because it's got this nice phenomenology of defining commitments and then draws from a describing a kind of Christian commitment.

278
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,320
He ends up drawing a kind of Greek Plato conclusion.

279
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:19,279
And how it happens is interesting.

280
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:25,600
So on 77 of this translation, where do we get?

281
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,479
Why do we start with that?

282
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,240
Why, I don't know, but I'm doing it in a funny order, so I'm switching to my order.

283
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:51,680
The description of his relation to this friend is, before we had reached the end of the first year of friendship that was sweeter to me than all the joys of life as I lived in, you took him from the world.

284
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,799
That's the problem.

285
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,080
But starting with this, they were so close to each other, they never left each other's side.

286
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:00,320
They were completely dependent on each other.

287
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,399
They were always happy when they were together.

288
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,439
And he describes this beautiful relationship.

289
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:08,000
And then this friend dies.

290
00:28:07,999 --> 00:28:20,319
And then what happens is the kind of grief that comes, which I keep talking about, which is why you don't want to let yourself get into this situation, where everything in the world becomes meaningless.

291
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,360
He says, My heart grew somber with grief, and wherever I looked, I saw only death.

292
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,079
And where else?

293
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,079
Let's see.

294
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:35,240
I wondered that other men should live when he was dead, for I had loved him as though he would never die.

295
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:40,520
I wondered that he should die and I remain alive, for I was his second self.

296
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:47,160
But now the second self isn't a joke anymore, as it was in the symposium, and that they're sticking together all the time.

297
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:53,240
It's this kind of romantic love, except it comes out quite differently.

298
00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:12,600
So now everything has made sorrow for him, for the grief I felt for the loss of my friend had struck so essentially into my innermost heart, simply because I had poured out my soul upon him like water upon sand, loving a man who was mortal as though he would never die.

299
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:27,000
That is, he was treating, and everybody does, he was treating this love, which was vulnerable, as if it was the surest thing of all, and letting himself get more and more involved in it.

300
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:30,279
And that is exactly what the Knight of Faith is going to do.

301
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:35,480
But Augustine thinks that it shows that he's done something wrong.

302
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:38,760
He says, Blessed are those who love...

303
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,720
Now, where do I have to.

304
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:45,960
The moral is, now, this is the moral of all this bad experience he's had.

305
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:51,640
Blessed are those who love you, O God, and love their friends in you and their enemies for your sake.

306
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,559
They alone, this is the crucial thing, will never lose those who are dear to them.

307
00:29:55,559 --> 00:30:00,039
For they love them in one who is never lost, in God.

308
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:05,959
So the finite temporal part of the relationship is not important.

309
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:07,160
It goes away.

310
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:10,200
Let me see now if I want to read more.

311
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,880
No, I think that's fine.

312
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,239
Now you've got in it.

313
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:21,680
The fact that he understands how important this love is, and he understands how dangerous and vulnerable it is.

314
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:27,439
And he makes this move where he never says that his love of his friend was a petty thing.

315
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:30,399
That's the crucial difference between him and the symposium.

316
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:34,399
It's clear that he always loves and remembers his friend.

317
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,279
But he should have loved only the eternal meaning of the relationship, right?

318
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,080
He should have loved the friend in God.

319
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:44,800
And then it would have been safe.

320
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,840
And so it's not wrong to think that the friend is important.

321
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,320
It's absolutely crucial the way he describes it.

322
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,840
He understands this kind of commitment to the friend completely.

323
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:01,840
But he thinks that the right way to do it, so as to not suffer, is to love the friend.

324
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:08,719
And again, the way I can put it to make some sense of it to myself is love the meaning of their relationship.

325
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,200
Love the happiness they had together.

326
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,519
But and don't get hooked on the actual presence of the friend.

327
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:21,039
Otherwise, bad, bad things will happen to you, namely total grief and suffering.

328
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,199
And so in the end, he says, I guess, did I read this?

329
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:25,679
I'm not sure.

330
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,280
Yeah, I think I did already.

331
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,439
I was to make sure I read what I wanted.

332
00:31:29,439 --> 00:31:33,119
Yeah, that the friend is in God and never lost in God.

333
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:36,160
That's the crucial conclusion.

334
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:39,999
And he never mentions the friend again in the confession.

335
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:45,680
That's sort of Plato-like, that once you get beyond it, you don't have to think about it.

336
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,559
But it's not Plato-like to say that it's a petty thing.

337
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:50,559
It was that's the Christian.

338
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:52,559
You see what I mean?

339
00:31:53,200 --> 00:32:00,200
The Greek part has made him think that he can love his friend in God and get out of the spatiotemporal and out of the risk.

340
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:14,120
And the Christian part has made him describe this relation to the friend, not as just one beautiful body among many, and not as one beautiful soul among the many, but an absolutely essential experience in his life, which he will never forget.

341
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:19,720
He will always preserve the significance of it in God, but not in this world.

342
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,360
Yeah.

343
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,240
Yeah.

344
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,519
It's exactly the same step as Dante's taking with Beatrice.

345
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:25,079
I think.

346
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:25,719
Let me see.

347
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,039
She's his savior.

348
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:29,559
She's dead.

349
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,479
He's loved her.

350
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,119
Yes, that's it.

351
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:34,599
Good.

352
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:37,560
And Beatrice, and Beatrice tells him so.

353
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,959
Beatrice says, It's funny.

354
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:47,719
We wish you could read the Divine Comedy because Dante's got enough of this Judeo-Christian sense of the real embodiment.

355
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:55,880
Because the first thing he does when he sees Beatrice, who shows up in the Divine Comedy, in the, I can't resist telling you, I don't think I did.

356
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:03,080
Dante, in the middle of the divine comedy, there's a procession in which all the books of the Old Testament walk by.

357
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:14,520
And then there's, and then there's the four gospel writers going by, and then there's a kind of chariot in which somebody is there, just covered up, so you can't see them.

358
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:19,080
And the angels are flying over this chariot, singing, Blessed is he who comes.

359
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:23,240
And then the person in the chariot throws off this covering.

360
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:31,159
Who would be in the chariot in the middle of history, led up to by the Old Testament and leading the New Testament with angels overhead?

361
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,600
Who could that be?

362
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:35,000
It's got to be Jesus, of course.

363
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:35,639
But it isn't.

364
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,919
It's Beatrice.

365
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:51,600
And the first thing she does after throwing this off is scold him forever paying attention to any other women and for getting upset when she died when he should have remained faithful to her the meaning of the relationship.

366
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:53,599
And Dante goes through the same thing.

367
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:58,880
And the first thing he does when he sees her is to remember how beautiful her legs were.

368
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,519
And then gets all hot thinking about him.

369
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,800
And she scolds him for that.

370
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,159
It's all very interesting.

371
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:08,880
So then he stops paying attention to her legs and starts paying attention to her smile, which is better.

372
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,840
And the angels overhead say, isn't that nice?

373
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:17,680
And finally, finally, he gets totally just hypnotized looking into her eyes.

374
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:22,800
And what he sees in her eyes is the symbol of the God-man, of Jesus.

375
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:30,320
So again, I mean, twice in the middle of the poem, he tells you, Beatrice is my Savior.

376
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:36,959
And then remember, I said he was going to write a poem about his girlfriend like nobody ever did before, and he sure does.

377
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:53,039
And then, and that's what's her point, but then, in the end, Beatrice starts, from the beginning of reappearing, Beatrice said, You never should have cared about my body, you never should have cared about the finite and the temporal to talk like Kierkegaard.

378
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:55,600
You should, we should have loved each other in God.

379
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:04,560
And in the end, they just both are staring at God, and they don't even, they give one last smile to each other, they never look at each other again for eternity.

380
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:11,360
And that's when the Greek wipes out the Christian, just as it does in Augustine.

381
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:11,679
Yeah.

382
00:35:11,919 --> 00:35:14,159
That's for a bit larger than that.

383
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:25,039
Ah, uh-ha.

384
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:26,159
Good.

385
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:26,959
Good, good.

386
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,959
So, let me give you sort of, you realize, I hope, but if you don't, I better tell you.

387
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:43,080
I mean, the reason, the literary reason he's writing about resignation is that the book is being written by Johannes de Salentio, who is a knight of resignation.

388
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:45,560
And this is just, this doesn't answer your question yet.

389
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:58,760
And the reason he's writing about it at all in the world is because he's going into resignation in the face of having, for some reason he never explains, not being able to marry Beatrice like the lad couldn't get the princess.

390
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,040
And why is he talking so much about resignation?

391
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:23,479
Because he wants to tell you how important it is to have a commitment and how tempting it is to have a resignation, and how relatively easy it is to have resignation compared to what everybody could have if they had faith and were strong enough, which is being a knight of faith.

392
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:27,559
And he keeps saying, I don't really understand the night of faith.

393
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:29,079
I can't do the night of faith.

394
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:31,320
The best I can do is resignation.

395
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:55,480
Now, so my direct answer to you is he's writing about resignation because that's the best thing you can do short of being a very, very difficult character, namely the knight of faith who somehow keeps the meaning and the vulnerability because you can't get rid of it as resignation tries to do.

396
00:36:55,479 --> 00:37:02,519
And when Kierkegaard, somebody asked me after class last time, what's Kierkegaard's unconditional commitment?

397
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:04,439
Obviously, not, Regina.

398
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:05,959
And it's relevant here.

399
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:26,320
Kierkegaard thought that it was his destiny to make Christianity very hard and to show people how hard it was and to fight the Lutheran church, which had made it so easy that you could be born a Christian and born a Lutheran without having to do anything at all except just be born in Denmark.

400
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,120
And he tried to become a martyr to this.

401
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:50,640
He wrote this, I told you the last book, I think I told you, call it Attack on Christendom, in which he said that the Lutheran church was part of the, was the worst scandal and problem because it was making it easy and therefore impossible to be a Christian, because being a Christian is very hard.

402
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,759
And this is part of what's very hard to be a knight of faith.

403
00:37:53,999 --> 00:37:56,399
The reward is terrific, but it's very hard.

404
00:37:56,399 --> 00:38:01,360
And I told somebody this at the end, which they thought was sort of interesting, so I'll tell you too.

405
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:06,079
When Kierkegaard wrote this attack on Christendom, I think he was in his 50s, wasn't he?

406
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,679
Well, even that young.

407
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,040
He was 42.

408
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,720
He did his job.

409
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:19,680
Since nobody would make him a martyr, the church wasn't going to burn him or hang him, he just died.

410
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:27,519
Fell down on the street with a disease that nobody could particularly diagnose and just died, done his job.

411
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,559
David wrote a book about Kierkegaard.

412
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,799
That's always struck me as absolutely amazing.

413
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,960
You go ahead.

414
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:47,880
So, your conscience or this, how are you know, not a desire?

415
00:38:48,479 --> 00:38:48,959
Right.

416
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:52,800
I mean, uh the I'm trying to think about this.

417
00:38:52,800 --> 00:39:05,240
I mean, being aware of these kinds of resignation, uh, I think he thinks the consciousness is important because you can be aware of the kind of resignation you've got when he tells you about it.

418
00:39:05,399 --> 00:39:07,800
You can say, oh, that's just like me.

419
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:15,960
And then you can and then he tells you also that this kind of resignation is despair because you can't get the finite and the temporal.

420
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:19,639
And I think that's supposed to sort of help you.

421
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:30,760
You can't then willfully become a knight of faith, but you can sort of, I think, lose your attachment to and enjoyment of.

422
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:33,240
It's very interesting, very interesting.

423
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,160
It'll be a knight of resignation.

424
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:54,760
In every stage which you could be in, the aesthetic stage, which we mentioned of feeling, or the ethical stage where you try to do the job of being a good husband or wife and do your civic duties and get your meaning out of that, or even the stage of resignation.

425
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,200
There's always two ways it looks.

426
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:05,240
It looks like it's making your life work for the people in it.

427
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:13,640
And it looks like for the people who've already seen that it's despair and gone on, that it's a trap and your life isn't really working.

428
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:19,720
So he writes his books in a very peculiar way, which he calls indirect discourse.

429
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:25,880
First, he writes a book about the aesthetic stage of enjoyment, keeping all your possibilities open.

430
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,480
We've heard about that already.

431
00:40:27,479 --> 00:40:33,320
And it's written from somebody, from the point of view of somebody who thinks it's a great thing to be in the aesthetic.

432
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:36,759
But you can see on the margins that this guy is in despair.

433
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,640
He's suffering from a lot of melancholy, and he gets more and more unhappy as the book goes on.

434
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,800
And then the ethical, the next stage is the ethical.

435
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:55,519
Judge William, who's a husband and a judge, the perfectly sort of ethical type, and it looks like that's the solution to everything.

436
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,120
That's how to lead a full life.

437
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:04,320
But then you begin to read around the margin and toward the end, that he's in despair, seen from an even higher stage.

438
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,199
So it's always, so now I'm trying to say that.

439
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:25,520
So his picture of it is you help somebody see that what they think is the right way to live and it's working, that it's not working, by showing them both that they identify with the aesthetic or the ethical, and then they get to the end of the book and they're discovering, if they're a very sensitive reader, the breakdown.

440
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:27,840
I think it's really brilliant on his part.

441
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,280
That's all he can do.

442
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:43,999
And then it'll either drive you to have an experience of leaping into the next sphere, as he calls these spheres of existence, the aesthetic, the ethical, the religious, and when it does, you will be in the next sphere.

443
00:41:43,999 --> 00:41:46,160
You can't really choose to do it.

444
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,919
It's much deeper than that.

445
00:41:48,479 --> 00:41:51,120
It's like reading him would be a kind of therapy.

446
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,720
I think that's what he thinks.

447
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,079
Okay, good question.

448
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,159
I saw another hand while I was talking to him.

449
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,720
Beatrice, yes.

450
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,840
That's right.

451
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,959
That's yeah, in fact, that is the punchline.

452
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:05,520
I said it early just because I had to say it.

453
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:07,919
But yes, that's right.

454
00:42:07,919 --> 00:42:11,439
The middle of 73 is as close as you ever.

455
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:15,039
Well, sorry, no, let's wait for a minute, Beatrice, because that is it.

456
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:17,120
But there's a stage or two in between.

457
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,520
And then ask your question or say what you want to say.

458
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,919
Because we're still, let's see now.

459
00:42:21,919 --> 00:42:28,639
We've gotten, there's the hero and the bourgeois way of life, and we're skipping over them.

460
00:42:28,999 --> 00:42:38,040
We've now gotten a kind of Christian way of becoming a knight of resignation.

461
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:39,079
Let's see now.

462
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:48,360
I'm just reading now, this is just to lead up to the best way of trying to make resignation work, the highest kind of resignation.

463
00:42:48,680 --> 00:43:00,999
So remember, somehow all these ways, like the one we just read, of finally, never mind making the meaning of it, that's not happened yet.

464
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,520
We've got all these people like Augustine and Dante so far.

465
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:10,360
And that's not enough to have your sort of, love each other in God.

466
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:21,480
We want some kind, we Judeo-Christians need that somehow the full meaning of our life has to make our life worthwhile, to give us bliss.

467
00:43:21,479 --> 00:43:26,919
We have to live fully in the finite and the temporal.

468
00:43:26,919 --> 00:43:37,560
So then, is there some way, and that means, I hear having italics, but that means the more meaning, the more vulnerability.

469
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:41,720
That's sort of a slogan that I had in the back of my mind at the beginning of the lecture.

470
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,959
I mean, that's the danger.

471
00:43:43,959 --> 00:43:46,919
I mean, but it's not a danger you can avoid.

472
00:43:46,919 --> 00:43:55,160
The way things are set up, the more deeply you get involved, the more risky it is, and the more meaningful everything is.

473
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:04,840
And so the question becomes: is there a way of making a defining commitment and yet be safe and not vulnerable?

474
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:09,639
And that's the what that's now what we get next.

475
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:20,399
And that's, I'm trying to think, is it Dante or is it, I don't know how I exactly later, but that's what's going on at the bottom of 72.

476
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,480
And it's an important thing, starting about 20 lines from the bottom.

477
00:44:26,479 --> 00:44:30,000
Only lower natures forget themselves and become something new.

478
00:44:29,999 --> 00:44:31,760
We've read that, skipping a little.

479
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,320
Deeper natures never forget themselves and never become something other than they were.

480
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,399
So the knight will remember everything.

481
00:44:38,399 --> 00:44:40,080
This is the night of resignation.

482
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,960
But the memory is precisely the pain.

483
00:44:42,959 --> 00:44:46,960
And yet his infinite resignation is reconciled with existence.

484
00:44:46,959 --> 00:44:50,399
In his infinite resignation, he's reconciled with existence.

485
00:44:50,399 --> 00:45:01,279
His love for the princess would take on for him the expression of eternal love, would acquire a religious character, be transfigured into a love for the eternal being.

486
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,479
Notice Augustine and Dante are doing this.

487
00:45:04,479 --> 00:45:09,520
They're turning their love of love for the other one in God.

488
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:20,640
And that means, in a way, forgetting the other person in a certain way, as ever having to, Dante never has to never smile through Beatrice again, and Augustine never mentions his friend again.

489
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,439
They've turned it into an eternal love.

490
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:38,640
It's transfigured into a love for the eternal being, which although it denied fulfillment, still reconciles him once more in the eternal consciousness of his love's validity in the eternal form that no reality can take from it.

491
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:44,959
That is, you bring out the true meaning of the love.

492
00:45:44,959 --> 00:45:47,280
There's echoes of Plato still in here.

493
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,320
That what's really important is that it's love.

494
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,880
And the highest kind of love is love of God.

495
00:45:52,880 --> 00:46:01,080
And one way to put this is, Beatrice or the friend of Augustine has become the way that you get to the truth.

496
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:06,839
In the Gospel of John, John says Jesus is the truth and the way.

497
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:18,280
And what's happening in these Greek-influenced Christians who've got too much Plato and Aristotle in them, they can't really understand loving Beatrice as the truth.

498
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,080
That would be the truth is subjectivity.

499
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:25,319
That would be Beatrice as the object of infinite commitment and so forth.

500
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:33,240
They can understand Beatrice as leading them to see that they really love God.

501
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:43,000
That's the medieval Christian Beatrice Dante solution.

502
00:46:42,999 --> 00:46:51,880
And there's so they've got a notion now of the love's validity in an eternal form.

503
00:46:51,880 --> 00:47:00,360
I think that means what was really important about the love was that it was loving and not that it was about a finite temporal person.

504
00:47:00,919 --> 00:47:09,399
And so love turns out to be a way to get to loving God and loving God is safe.

505
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:15,080
He has to turn his attention away from finite temporal Beatrice and so forth.

506
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:28,680
Okay, now there's one further stage, and this is where Beatrice's question came in: that we don't think that the highest is love of God, transforming this love into love of God.

507
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:46,880
What we've got is something like a secular version of that, which is transforming the love into an idealized version of the love, in which you love the significance of it, the meaning of it, the beauty of it, of that love with that person.

508
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,680
You remember them, and you remember how great it was to be with them, and so forth.

509
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:57,280
That's the move of resignation that we're going to talk about.

510
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,239
And then I can give you particular examples.

511
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,320
Where's the page, Beatrice?

512
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,999
That's what I thought.

513
00:48:05,999 --> 00:48:06,559
72.

514
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:07,199
Let me.

515
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:15,680
Oh, well, 72, well, no, then 72, it's the one I just read then, and it's not all got all gone all the way.

516
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,359
Yes, that's what you want.

517
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,240
Exactly.

518
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,160
This is about 20 lines down.

519
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:27,519
This is the modern romantic way of having, I've been promising and promising this.

520
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:30,640
How can you have this love and the invulnerable?

521
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,239
The answers, and this is all in very important preparation for the movie.

522
00:48:34,399 --> 00:48:36,240
That's why I'm stressing it so much.

523
00:48:36,959 --> 00:48:39,199
And what do you gain and what do you lose?

524
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:49,280
Well, we haven't talked about what you lose, but what you gain is you've got the whole marvelous, beautiful memory of this experience.

525
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,600
And nothing can take that away from you.

526
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,760
And that makes you who you are.

527
00:48:54,959 --> 00:48:59,360
You are still the lover of Mary, though Mary's gone now, died or left.

528
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,080
But you still have a definition.

529
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:06,800
And you still have, in some way, a meaningful world.

530
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,720
But of course, there's something missing.

531
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:16,399
You don't wake up every morning knowing what you have to do, as you did if you were the lover of X or the leader of something.

532
00:49:16,399 --> 00:49:21,039
But you just contemplate the significance that you were that.

533
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:32,999
I mean, if Martin Luther King had lost because the people didn't come to the peace march, he can still remember being the leader, preaching it, hoping for it, having a vision of it, and so forth.

534
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:34,919
So this is what he's saying on 73.

535
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,280
He keeps his love.

536
00:49:36,999 --> 00:49:37,800
Where do we start?

537
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,200
Yeah, about 15 lines down.

538
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:46,439
He's too proud to want to let the whole content of his life be a fleeting affair of the moment.

539
00:49:46,439 --> 00:49:51,080
I mean, in a certain way, that's, of course, what Plato did in the symposium.

540
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:54,680
He keeps this love young and it grows with him in years and beauty.

541
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:59,480
And on the other hand, he has no need, has no finite occasion for its growth.

542
00:49:59,479 --> 00:50:02,919
For the moment he made the movement, the princess is lost.

543
00:50:02,919 --> 00:50:08,679
He needs none of this erotic titillation of the nerves at the sight of the loved one, etc.

544
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:15,320
Nor does he need in a finite sense to be making his farewell, for his memory of her is an eternal one.

545
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:22,200
And skipping a little, he has grasped the deep secret that even in loving another, one should be sufficient unto oneself.

546
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:33,640
That is, you can have this love, it can define you, but it can't hurt you because you're not dependent on the actual existence, presence of the other person.

547
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:37,720
So you've got the best of all worlds, it would seem.

548
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:42,439
And a little more on the next page about infinite resignation.

549
00:50:42,519 --> 00:50:45,319
And that's being, and now I have to make clear.

550
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:48,519
That's what it is finally to be a knight of infinite resignation.

551
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:50,520
That's the highest kind.

552
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:56,439
And all these others were sort of failed nights of infinite resignation.

553
00:50:56,439 --> 00:50:58,039
They didn't really bring it off.

554
00:50:58,039 --> 00:51:10,840
They didn't keep the individuality and the absolute importance of the other person who's there all the time, day and night, in a funny kind of, what, fake temporality.

555
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:18,239
I mean, they're always present to think about, and it's you think about them more than where you really are.

556
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:20,559
Let me just read a passage, and then somebody wants to say something.

557
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,639
Okay, where are we now?

558
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:28,000
74, this first full paragraph.

559
00:51:27,999 --> 00:51:31,280
In infinite resignation, there is peace and repose.

560
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:39,199
Anyone who wants it, who has not debased himself by what is still worse than being too proud, belittling himself, never mind that.

561
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:42,319
Just skip the parentheses, the dashes.

562
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:52,800
So anyone who wants it who has not debased himself can discipline himself into making this movement, which in its pain reconciles one with existence.

563
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,560
And that's Kierkegaard who did that with Regina.

564
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:01,759
And that's the writer of this book, Johannes de Salentio, has done that.

565
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:09,760
There is, again, skipping down, in infinite resignation, there is peace, repose, and consolation in pain.

566
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:18,320
And there's some stuff at the top of the page, which is a problem that I don't think.

567
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:30,799
Now, remind me, if you want, that what I say, what I haven't said it yet, but I'm going to say something that contradicts the top of 74 and knocked down Kierkegaard's grade a bit for having made a mistake.

568
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:36,639
But I'm not ready to wipe that mistake away a little later, or you'll get confused.

569
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:42,480
If you don't understand why he says what he says at the top of 74, that shows you're really understanding the book.

570
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,679
Go ahead.

571
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:57,279
I couldn't hear you well enough, and probably neither could the people in in the podcast world.

572
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,640
Say it again louder.

573
00:52:59,959 --> 00:53:06,840
How about love defines but you think that you live in the even lost being hurt?

574
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,439
Yes, exactly.

575
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:15,399
You depend on the world, and that's the nice thing.

576
00:53:15,399 --> 00:53:24,840
You can't get hurt if you depend on it in sense of the memory of it, the meaning of it, the fact that it's the most important thing in your life, that it tells you who you are.

577
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:27,159
You're the lover of Mary who lost Mary.

578
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:31,800
But that's still a very defining, very meaningful way to be.

579
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,320
And that's how you can do it.

580
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:36,600
Be sufficient under yourself and you can't get hurt.

581
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:40,039
And that's the moment of resignation.

582
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,480
Yeah.

583
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,679
Oh boy.

584
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:43,479
And how?

585
00:53:43,479 --> 00:53:46,999
But it really, that's the whole next lecture.

586
00:53:46,999 --> 00:54:02,280
But basically, the Knight of Faith sees the sword hanging over the head of the beloved and gets more and more involved with the finite, embodied, present love all the time.

587
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,279
So the Knight of that's the interesting thing.

588
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:10,280
The Knight of Faith has the actual person there or the cause or whatever.

589
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:21,880
And the fulfillment and the fun and the romantic situations and the sexual pleasures and all that, the Knight of Faith has all of that.

590
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:34,040
And knows that it's vulnerable, but doesn't sort of put all their defenses into keeping from being hurt, but puts all their energy into getting more and more involved.

591
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:39,000
And just as I'm saying it now, you're supposed to be thinking, but that's a crazy thing to do.

592
00:54:38,999 --> 00:54:52,320
Why would anybody get themselves in the situation of getting more and more involved, knowing that that could at any moment lead them to be terribly hurt, like Augustine when his friend died?

593
00:54:52,320 --> 00:55:00,320
Why not take the safer one, the infinite resignation, where you get everything but the actual finite embodied person.

594
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:04,800
You get all the meaning of the relationship, and isn't the meaning what really matters?

595
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:09,360
Well, Kierkegaard wants to both say that's very attractive.

596
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:22,960
That's as near as you can get to having the relationship and being safe, but it's not good enough because, and now I could just ask you and you will know the answer.

597
00:55:22,959 --> 00:55:27,600
Why is infinite resignation?

598
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:28,959
Let's find a quote.

599
00:55:28,959 --> 00:55:32,399
I read them already, but now you're in a position to see what they mean.

600
00:55:33,439 --> 00:55:34,319
Darn.

601
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,919
I'm going to find some.

602
00:55:35,919 --> 00:55:36,560
Maybe.

603
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,559
I want to find about the pain in the relation.

604
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:40,080
Is that 75?

605
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,480
It's right around there.

606
00:55:43,999 --> 00:55:45,359
Bottom of 75.

607
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:52,159
When he lists the joy and the pain that goes with being a knight of resignation, he does it every once in a while.

608
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,560
He says at the middle of 74 in the infinite resignation, there's peace and repose.

609
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:02,640
But he also says when he says the whole thing, and there's suffering.

610
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,560
Just help me find that one.

611
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,240
73 at the bottom.

612
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,040
Okay.

613
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:09,999
I don't see it there.

614
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:12,880
Where do you see it?

615
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:14,079
Oh, yeah.

616
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,199
I don't see it yet, but I see you're right.

617
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,320
Where on 73?

618
00:56:20,959 --> 00:56:23,359
Oh, 72, no wonder I can't see it.

619
00:56:24,479 --> 00:56:25,599
And I don't see it yet.

620
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,799
Now what's wrong with me?

621
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,839
Okay, I see.

622
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,279
No, I want to talk about the pain.

623
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,880
Where is the pain?

624
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,960
The very bottom.

625
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:36,760
Reconcile.

626
00:56:36,999 --> 00:56:39,079
And denied his fulfillment.

627
00:56:39,079 --> 00:56:40,759
That's Sparta we were talking about.

628
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:46,519
Reconcile him in the eternal consciousness of his love's validity that no reality can take from him.

629
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:47,959
I still don't see the pain.

630
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,080
Okay.

631
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,479
Ah, got it.

632
00:56:51,479 --> 00:56:53,399
Yeah, that's the right quote, all right.

633
00:56:53,399 --> 00:56:59,239
Deeper natures never forget themselves and never become something other than they were, so the night will remember everything.

634
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:01,959
That's this wonderful relationship, remembering it.

635
00:57:01,959 --> 00:57:07,799
That the memory is precisely the pain, and yet in his infinite resignation, he is reconciled with existence.

636
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:16,120
I mean, he understands that he's got as much as you can hope to get, and he's got all that meaning, and he just has to take the pain along with it.

637
00:57:16,119 --> 00:57:17,320
And that's it.

638
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,760
Okay, yeah.

639
00:57:19,079 --> 00:57:19,960
Okay.

640
00:57:20,439 --> 00:57:23,559
Well, maybe if she finds more.

641
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:26,199
I guess after a little higher.

642
00:57:26,519 --> 00:57:27,720
Yeah, stop, stop.

643
00:57:27,959 --> 00:57:28,760
That's the quote.

644
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,759
That's a mistake, I think.

645
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,480
But that's what you're about to say.

646
00:57:33,479 --> 00:57:34,839
Yes, it's wrong.

647
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:42,679
Now, remember, I said, if you think that the top of page 74 doesn't make sense and is the wrong thing to say, you're really understanding it.

648
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:43,960
Congratulations.

649
00:57:43,959 --> 00:57:46,279
I can't make any sense out of it.

650
00:57:46,280 --> 00:58:01,399
But to say how wrong it is and why it's obviously why he's led to make the mistake, the mistake, I can't be too mysterious, is where I have to skip a big jump, which I'll just do right now, and then we'll come back to it.

651
00:58:01,439 --> 00:58:06,600
I mean, we have to get to what he says that makes he can't, it shows that he can't say that.

652
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:08,599
So, where we go.

653
00:58:08,599 --> 00:58:09,800
He's safe.

654
00:58:10,519 --> 00:58:10,999
Right?

655
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,280
Absolutely.

656
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:17,199
But there's a stronger place than that, what he's saying, which I could want to find.

657
00:58:17,439 --> 00:58:23,999
And then, because people won't see very well yet what you're seeing, how it's contradicted, unless I go further.

658
00:58:23,999 --> 00:58:27,120
So, let me start this: the downside, I'll still have time.

659
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:30,079
The downside of resignation.

660
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:33,839
We talked about the pain, but now let's get the pain clear.

661
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:40,079
So, you're self-sufficient, so that you're never fully joyful.

662
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:44,399
Aha, if I'd only paid attention to my markings, I have a page for this too.

663
00:58:44,959 --> 00:58:47,919
Let's see if it's better or worse than the pages you guys got.

664
00:58:47,919 --> 00:58:56,079
On page 63, he says, At the bottom, I am happy and satisfied.

665
00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:02,720
That this is the night of resignation talking, of course, that my happiness is not faith, and compared with that, it's indeed unhappy.

666
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,360
That's all.

667
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:12,320
That's just another way, it's no better, no worse than you're saying that it's joyful, that it's always sad and suffering at the same time.

668
00:59:12,959 --> 00:59:16,880
And now comes the point that's going to lead to his problem.

669
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:29,359
And he says that if that there's something wrong with the night of resignation, in that if the night of resignation got the loved one back, he wouldn't know what to do with him or her.

670
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:32,080
You see why that's the stage to getting where you are?

671
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:33,840
And why would that be?

672
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:48,080
Well, he's resigned himself to making the whole of the finite, temporal, embodied other person irrelevant and said, What's really important is the meaning of this relationship.

673
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:51,560
Right now, suppose the other person comes back.

674
00:59:51,559 --> 00:59:53,039
Let's just fill it out.

675
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:55,880
He's gotten used to living without the other person.

676
00:59:55,880 --> 01:00:01,560
Then the other person is not essential, in fact, it seems sort of awkward to have this person around.

677
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,280
And why is it so awkward?

678
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:09,480
Well, if you don't get attached to them, then they're sort of a stranger in your house.

679
01:00:09,479 --> 01:00:13,719
But if you do get attached to them, you're back where you started with the problem.

680
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:20,760
Because if their bodily presence is important and fulfilling and thrilling and all that, then you're going to get more and more involved.

681
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,000
Then you're going to get more and more hurt.

682
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:33,880
And so the person who's done the movement of resignation doesn't want this other person around because they're either just a bother or worse, they're a temptation.

683
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:40,439
So you would get into the anxiety all over again.

684
01:00:40,439 --> 01:00:47,480
And if you're a kind of Christian, even Augustine can't resist getting hooked on beautiful things.

685
01:00:47,479 --> 01:00:57,560
After he's managed to get unhooked from ever having a friend or any other human being so close, he says that he can't resist the attraction of the incense.

686
01:00:57,559 --> 01:00:59,079
He loves the smell.

687
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:04,279
Then he starts saying how much he loves the stained glass windows and the light and so forth.

688
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:10,439
There is just this tendency to get to find the finite and temporal beautiful, wonderful, and so forth.

689
01:01:10,439 --> 01:01:14,280
And that's a big risk for the night of resignation.

690
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:20,439
So, and on 65, you hear about it again.

691
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,880
So, the loved one can only be in the way.

692
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:24,919
And where do we find that?

693
01:01:24,919 --> 01:01:30,919
On 65, at the end of the top paragraph, my behavior would have vitiated the whole story.

694
01:01:30,919 --> 01:01:32,039
Never mind that part.

695
01:01:32,039 --> 01:01:34,840
Or I would have been at a loss if I got Isaac back.

696
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:38,359
In this case, Kierkegaard saying, I'd be at a loss if I got Regina back.

697
01:01:38,359 --> 01:01:42,039
What Abraham found the easiest of all would be for me hard.

698
01:01:42,039 --> 01:01:43,479
I'm explaining why it's hard.

699
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:47,760
The other person is either a temptation or just an annoyance.

700
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,680
To find joy again in Isaac.

701
01:01:50,880 --> 01:02:01,680
For he who, with all the infinity of his soul, on his own account and with his own responsibility, has made the infinite movement and can do no more, that person keeps Isaac with pain.

702
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:07,919
So you just write, Kierkegaard, if he got Regina back, could only keep Regina with pains, right?

703
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:22,479
And then you turn to the page that I said was just hopeless, but you could see why he would write it, because it's so, it's an expression of such sort of longing at the top of 74.

704
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:38,800
And this is a message to Regina, but it contradicts the previous message, namely, that I'm a knight of resignation, and I'm afraid now I could never know what to do with you if I got you back, because he says, and this is sort of advice to her, she too will keep her love young and sound.

705
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:44,559
She too will have overcome her agony, even though she does not, as the song says, lie at her Lord's side.

706
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:51,199
These two will then be united to each other in all eternity with such a strict, pre-established harmony.

707
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:52,959
Now, soft, so far, so good.

708
01:02:52,959 --> 01:02:54,880
It's like Dante and Beatrice.

709
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:59,760
She understands that she's never going to go to bed with them anymore.

710
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,159
She understands that.

711
01:03:02,159 --> 01:03:09,519
And she understands that they can still remain true to each other in their sense of the meaning of the relationship.

712
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:10,560
And then he blows it.

713
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:16,479
He says, so the two will be suited to each other in all eternity.

714
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,199
Fine.

715
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:31,159
With such a strict, tempoed, pre-established harmony that were, now comes the trouble, some moment to come, a moment in which they nevertheless not concern finitely, for in the finite world they would grow old.

716
01:03:31,159 --> 01:03:41,479
Were such a moment to come, which allowed their love its expression in time, then they would be in a position to begin precisely where they would have begun had they been united from the beginning.

717
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:43,239
Now, what's the now complaint?

718
01:03:47,079 --> 01:03:49,959
Yeah, don't forget me, keep desiring me.

719
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:53,559
Maybe if everything works out, we'll just get back together again.

720
01:03:53,560 --> 01:04:07,959
And you can get to experience, it wouldn't be lower immediacy because that would be butterflies losing their essence.

721
01:04:08,279 --> 01:04:08,999
No, no, no.

722
01:04:08,999 --> 01:04:24,840
He says, if we've got this right relation to the ideal version of our love, then if we could ever get back together in the real world and in temporality, we could begin just where we left off, bodily and day by day, loving each other.

723
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:32,840
Yeah, well, it could be, but it also could be higher immediacy because the Knight of Faith also has the other person finite and temporal day to day.

724
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:43,079
What he's really trying to do is get a bit of the goodies of the Knight of Faith, which we haven't got to yet, who gets more and more involved and keeps the finite and temporal.

725
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:52,199
He wants to run away where it's safe, keeping in mind the ideal of the relationship and keeping open the possibility of getting back together.

726
01:04:52,199 --> 01:05:04,919
Now that's okay, but it can't go along with him saying that he doesn't know how he would ever be able to take the princess back, and that he doesn't understand how Abraham could ever take Isaac back.

727
01:05:04,919 --> 01:05:13,880
And I just told you why, because once you take them back, you're sort of starting on a step on an escalator, which will get you into the same trouble again.

728
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:25,999
You'll either just have them sort of like a ghost in your house because you can't really care about the finite temporal side of them, or you'll start really appreciating the fact that they're together.

729
01:05:25,999 --> 01:05:31,680
You're together, finite and temporal, every day embodied together, and you're off on the big risk again.

730
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:55,039
Because if that either it's not important at all what the person is actually like and what the person is actually doing, because all you need is the ideal, and then you're okay, or it's very important what the other person is actually like at every moment, right here and now, at which point it's a risk because they might stop being here and now.

731
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:57,439
And he's trying to have it both ways.

732
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:01,119
The philosophical Kierkegaard, not I mean, not in the bad sense of philosophy.

733
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:16,880
I mean, the Kierkegaard who's thinking out this position of infinite resignation and seeing the advantages and the disadvantages, has a view that one of the big disadvantages when you give this person up and make their ideal crucial, you can't take them back.

734
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:25,439
And the Kierkegaard who's sitting in Berlin, wishing he was at home with Regina in Copenhagen, is making a mistake.

735
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,079
Yeah.

736
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,359
But you mean the second round you maybe could get a chance.

737
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:47,119
I think I see what you're saying, I think, but I think it won't work because that's this business of you don't get another chance in Kierkegaard.

738
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:57,039
If you make the movement of resignation, you actually deny, like Plato and Augustine, that the real person being there is significant, and that's what makes it safe.

739
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:58,479
And you don't get another chance.

740
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:01,880
You're saying, well, maybe the next time they get together, he can be a knight of faith.

741
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:04,680
He can really manage to stay in the finite and temporal.

742
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:07,479
But yeah, yeah, wait till next time.

743
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:10,519
I think you're thinking ahead of where we are.

744
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:10,919
Yeah.

745
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:15,399
Well, this is supposed to be a kind of theoretical book.

746
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:22,520
I mean, you shouldn't literally contradict himself in a bad sense, saying, let me just repeat it so you can see it, and then let's forget it.

747
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:26,119
It's just the only place in the whole book that I know that he makes a mistake.

748
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:38,840
He's saying the knight of resignation can't ever take the loved one back because they can't stand vulnerability, and the only way to get rid of vulnerability is to make the meaning of the relation all that matters.

749
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:47,079
He can't say that and say at the same time, and the great thing about the knight of resignation is if the girl ever comes back, he can begin with her right where he left off.

750
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:49,959
I mean, he wouldn't want her to come back, he just said.

751
01:07:49,959 --> 01:08:00,679
And the right thing to say is the first thing, and he says it over and over, that you can't take the, when you make the knight of resignation, you leave the finite and temporal for good.

752
01:08:01,159 --> 01:08:02,039
That's it.

753
01:08:02,039 --> 01:08:09,559
Okay, I'm going to, next time we'll talk about the knight of faith who does something entirely different and much more amazing.
