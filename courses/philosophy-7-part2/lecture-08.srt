1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,560
And now, so problem, the whole issue of the teleological suspension of the ethical is the phenomenon can be summed up in one clear problem.

2
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:34,800
And that is, once you have some absolute source of meaning in your life, thanks a lot, then you have also a kind of an authority in your life that you have to obey, even if it goes against what is normally understood as the right thing to do.

3
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,920
Now, the sort of caricature of that, but it's just so clear and simple that it's something we could begin with.

4
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,521
You all had it once, right?

5
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:46,641
Never.

6
00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:47,761
Ah.

7
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:51,040
Well, yeah, I'm just going to read it then when we get to it.

8
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,000
Don't worry about it.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,521
And it's on the website.

10
00:00:54,161 --> 00:00:55,600
I'm very surprised.

11
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:59,920
I thought I handed it out on the back side of the revised syllabus.

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,841
Does that sound familiar to anybody?

13
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:03,440
Just a hallucination.

14
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,321
Okay.

15
00:01:04,961 --> 00:01:06,161
Hmm.

16
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,120
What?

17
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,881
Pascal.

18
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,601
It wasn't on, no, it wasn't on the Pascal things.

19
00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:14,441
You're right.

20
00:01:11,441 --> 00:01:15,480
That was the first syllabus.

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,200
There was a revised syllabus, which only changed the times of the movie, so it doesn't matter.

22
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:22,761
But then I thought I had Huckleberry Finn.

23
00:01:22,761 --> 00:01:26,040
I know I've got it in my computer, but I guess I didn't ever give it.

24
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,441
Out.

25
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,081
That's okay.

26
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:29,800
What I need, I can easily read.

27
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,601
So let's.

28
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:50,841
So, sir, a simplest example of the teleological suspension of the ethical, just utterly, utterly too simple to take seriously, and it's not supposed to be taken very seriously, is in Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing, where Benedict loves Beatrice, and Beatrice demands that Benedict kill Claudio.

29
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:53,561
How many know the play, any of you?

30
00:01:53,560 --> 00:02:02,441
And in effect, she says, I don't like Claudio, and if you love me, then you'll do what I tell you to do, and I tell you to kill Claudio.

31
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:12,761
And the idea is, if you really got an unconditional commitment to Beatrice, there, then if Beatrice requires it, you'd better do it.

32
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:17,800
It's the Knights and Ladies story in a kind of comic version.

33
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,120
But of course, it needn't be comic.

34
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,680
I mean, it turns out to be comic because Claudio doesn't have to go through with the murder.

35
00:02:25,961 --> 00:02:31,480
But the point is, it could become terrible.

36
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,521
And of course, it does become terrible in the case of Abraham and Isaac.

37
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:55,161
And so now, Abraham and Isaac's story, which never fit too well with the unconditional commitment, defining relation, and so forth, because it was so weird that his defining relation was to his son, and it was so weird that somehow something commanded him to destroy the defining relation.

38
00:02:55,161 --> 00:02:57,120
It was a complete craziness.

39
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:59,040
But this time, it's pretty simple.

40
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,480
As Kierkegaard puts it, the ethical is just in Isaac.

41
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:12,000
That is, Isaac, you shouldn't kill people, and even more, not your own children.

42
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:22,000
So, Isaac is, well, on 88, he just says, in effect, Isaac is the ethical.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,961
Now, that's sort of confusing.

44
00:03:24,961 --> 00:03:31,601
So, I better tell you right now what the confusion is so you can be unconfused.

45
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:37,920
Most people, oddly enough, who write about this and read about it, don't even notice how confusing it is.

46
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,680
But if you're teaching it, at least in reading it my way, it seems it's a little bit weird.

47
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:58,880
Because what happens is first, Isaac is an example of the object of an unconditional commitment, and all this problem about the sword hanging over the head of the beloved, and the land of the princess is brought in in connection with Abraham's relation to Isaac.

48
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:08,161
And then, Isaac switches around and is a kind of instance of the ethical, namely, he wants to kill Isaac, and it's against the law to kill.

49
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:10,800
But so, let me just do it the way I was going to do it.

50
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:26,721
Show you first, even though it's not in your reading, on page 54, the clearest place where Isaac is really presented as if he was the object of Abraham defining commitment.

51
00:04:26,721 --> 00:04:35,041
That Abraham is, Abraham is who he is, gets his identity and his meaning through his relation to Isaac.

52
00:04:35,281 --> 00:04:41,281
It's not important, but just to show you how different that Isaac is than the one in the problem.

53
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:51,480
So here's the Isaac of the preamble from the heart, namely the unconditional commitment character, about 15 lines down on 54.

54
00:04:51,801 --> 00:05:02,281
Abraham believed, he believed he would become old in his land, honored among his people, blessed in his kin, eternally remembered in Isaac, the dearest in his life.

55
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:10,120
So Isaac is the one who gives meaning to Abraham's life, just like the beloved.

56
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,000
And that's fine.

57
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:46,761
But that's a different issue than on 88 when we're told about Isaac the following at the end of the big middle paragraph: insofar as the universal was there, the universal is the same as the ethical, because the ethical, you should get used to this, is universal in the sense that if it's wrong to kill, then it's wrong for everybody, everywhere, all the time.

58
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:53,401
I mean, at least let's say if it's wrong to kill when nobody's threatening you, and you know, you could make some qualifications for wars and stuff.

59
00:05:53,721 --> 00:06:03,640
But maybe, or if it's wrong to lie, everything else being equal, complications again, it applies to everybody, everywhere, all of the time.

60
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,160
What's right is just simply right, and what's wrong is simply wrong.

61
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,081
That's how the ethics works.

62
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:16,441
And then you bring in qualifications for the situation, but basically, the rules and principles are universal.

63
00:06:16,441 --> 00:06:38,241
So when he says, insofar as the universal was present, the universal here would be thou shalt not kill, at all, it was latent in Isaac, concealed as it were in Isaac's lines, and it, if the universal, would cry out with Isaac's mouth, don't do it, you're destroying everything.

64
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:45,761
That is, you're breaking the law, you're becoming a bad person, don't kill me, it's unethical to do it.

65
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:51,601
Now, it roughly, and for years I believed this and taught it for slightly simpler.

66
00:06:51,601 --> 00:07:01,121
I thought all of the defining commitment stuff is in the preamble from the heart, and all the ethical stuff is in problems 1, 2, and 3.

67
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:21,841
And that's right, except for some smart student who students are always helpful, but sometimes I wish they wouldn't discover these things, discovers that on page 60, which is the preamble from the heart, there is one mention of Isaac as the ethical, about 15 lines down.

68
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:28,401
The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he was willing to murder Isaac, and so forth.

69
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,801
I think that's all I want to read.

70
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:33,520
That, I think, belongs in problem one.

71
00:07:33,841 --> 00:07:35,921
Let's see if I need any more.

72
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,320
Well, we start a little further up, about ten lines down.

73
00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:51,281
If one hadn't the courage to think this thought, to say that Abraham was a murderer, then surely it's better to acquire that courage than to waste time on undeserved speeches of praise.

74
00:07:51,281 --> 00:07:57,601
So, there for a moment, the issue of the unethicalness of killing Isaac comes up.

75
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:17,801
You see how different the issue is, whether you somehow lose, it's so complicated if you kill him, but anyway, the loss of Isaac as Abraham's meaning is one thing, and the killing of Isaac as breaking the law is another.

76
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,441
And we're switching to the killing of Isaac as breaking the law.

77
00:08:22,441 --> 00:08:29,641
Now, it might help, and it might confuse more, I don't know which, to think why is Kierkegaard doing this?

78
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:35,161
Well, because in his relation to Regina, the two are mixed up together.

79
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:50,841
The fact is, one, he can't have Regina for some reason we don't know, the way the lad can't have the princess, and that is, it's got to do with the vulnerability of a commitment to another person.

80
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:56,841
He claiming he's completely defined in terms of Regina and claiming that somehow or other he can't marry her.

81
00:08:56,841 --> 00:09:02,281
Now, but he's also breaking his engagement to Regina.

82
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,040
And that's the anti-ethical.

83
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:09,400
I take it in 1850 in Copenhagen, engagements were big deals.

84
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,160
They were like super promises.

85
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:18,280
So now he's breaking his super promise to Regina, and that puts him out against the ethical.

86
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:27,401
So he's got both these problems on his mind when he flees to Berlin, and he sees both these problems, therefore, in the Abraham-Isaac story.

87
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,961
But the important thing is, and now we're going to stick to that.

88
00:09:29,961 --> 00:09:34,441
This was all sort of try to get you to just focus on the phenomenon.

89
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,201
The phenomenon and its philosophical implications is what we care about.

90
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:46,360
The rest is all just sort of confusion and gossip.

91
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,521
But the issue is clear.

92
00:09:48,520 --> 00:10:19,201
The issue is: what's the relation of your unconditional commitment to where it looks like you are required to make an exception of yourself, and you are defined uniquely as an individual, and you're called to do your own unique individual thing, and that seems to be higher than the ethical, whose principle is something like: never make an exception of yourself.

93
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:34,961
Always do what any good, rational, I guess, whatever, you could put different things in there, but whatever anybody who understands what's right and wrong would do, you would do.

94
00:10:34,961 --> 00:10:48,400
Remember, I said in the very first lecture, from the ethical point of view, the Greek point of view, every good, all the good people are exactly the same because they're all in the same situation, would do the same thing, namely the right thing.

95
00:10:48,721 --> 00:11:02,480
And in the Hebrew picture, every unique individual has their own unique calling, and it makes them, and this is Kierkegaard's term, an exception, or the exception, he calls them sometimes.

96
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:11,761
Anybody who becomes an individual, in Kierkegaard's sense of individual, by following their calling, is an exception.

97
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,681
And that's just another way of saying what I said in the first sentence of what I've been talking about.

98
00:11:17,681 --> 00:11:32,081
They are called by their unconditional commitment to go to do whatever that commitment requires, even if it looks from the point of view of ethics, as wrong.

99
00:11:32,081 --> 00:11:34,240
In Abraham's case, murder.

100
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,121
As Kierkegaard's case, breaking a promise.

101
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:44,360
So now I'm going to tell it to you in abstract form, probably easier, really, once you get used to it.

102
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:54,841
We're going to read the first paragraph, or half of it, on page 83, which is the beginning of problem one.

103
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,801
Where he's going to explain the teleological suspension of the ethical.

104
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:05,961
Okay, all of this stuff now should sound like what I've just been saying, only in philosophical language now.

105
00:12:05,961 --> 00:12:18,201
The ethical, as such, is the universal, and as the universal, it applies to everyone, which can be put another point, which can be put from another point of view by saying it applies at every moment.

106
00:12:18,201 --> 00:12:26,201
It rests imminently in itself and has nothing outside itself as this telos, but is itself the telos for everything outside.

107
00:12:26,841 --> 00:12:28,201
I'll explain that in a minute.

108
00:12:28,201 --> 00:12:31,801
And when that is taken up into it, it has no further to go.

109
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:42,841
That's a long, complicated way of saying that whatever is right is something you should do just because it's the right thing to do.

110
00:12:42,841 --> 00:12:45,960
Not because, if you, let's try telling the truth.

111
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:55,000
You could tell the truth because people would like you, or because people would trust you, or because it would be good for business, or because somebody might catch you if you don't.

112
00:12:55,001 --> 00:13:00,120
Those are all what Kant would call hypothetical reasons for doing something.

113
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,001
That is, if you want to be liked, tell the truth.

114
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:05,880
If you want to succeed in business, tell the truth.

115
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,520
But the ethical principle says simply, tell the truth.

116
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:20,360
Even if you lose your friends and fail in business and bad things happen to you, the ethical command is just tell the truth.

117
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,761
Kant has a famous name for this.

118
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:27,601
He calls it a categorical imperative.

119
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,241
That means an imperative means you just do it.

120
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:38,240
And categorial means for Kant, it's just there's no other reason to do it than just because it's the thing you have to do.

121
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:46,960
Whereas a hypothetical imperative, which is a Kant other term, means if you want such and such, then do such and such.

122
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:53,440
Okay, so Kierkegaard is just saying that where the ethical is concerned, it's the highest goal.

123
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,641
There's no further away to go, as he puts it.

124
00:13:57,281 --> 00:14:01,360
You can't say why you should be ethical.

125
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,961
You're just required by your conscience or by your reason.

126
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,880
Different philosophers have different views, by the Bible, by the natural law.

127
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:18,081
There have been a dozen possibilities, but they all tell you what you have to do just because it's the right thing.

128
00:14:18,081 --> 00:14:23,601
So that means its telos or goal is itself.

129
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,920
That's just this funny way of putting it.

130
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,200
Seen as the immediate, now we're going to get the good old lower and higher immediacy talk.

131
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,920
Seen as the immediate, no more than sensate and psychic being.

132
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:38,321
Oh, comes another whole story.

133
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:42,561
Just take my word for it.

134
00:14:42,561 --> 00:14:46,161
Put instead of single individual the particular.

135
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,561
I'll explain why in a minute.

136
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,960
The particular is the particular that has its telos in the universal.

137
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:05,200
And the particular's ethical task is always to express himself in this, to abrogate his particularity so as to become the universal.

138
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,801
Now, that's good.

139
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:09,360
It's that getting the individual in there.

140
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:16,761
This isn't about individuals as exceptions and so forth in the big deal sense.

141
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:26,680
I'll call it a capital I individual, where Kierkegaard said he wanted to carved on his tombstone that he was an individual, and where the individual is an exception and has a calling.

142
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,481
And I have to prepare you for this.

143
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:30,921
This is very hard to read.

144
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:40,120
I hate to have to do this to you, but no, if there was any translator who understood this, I would have told, you know, had you buy that translation.

145
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:55,240
There's only, apparently, only, I've checked this out with Danish people whose natural language is Danish, and it seems there is only one word in Danish, which does a double job, and we have two words for them in English, thank goodness.

146
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:12,040
And I think I may have already said this once, because when I talked about Kierkegaard wanting to be an individual, but remember, I'm pretty sure I said a particular is any, we could say individual thing, but it would be a funny thing to say.

147
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:17,081
This is a particular, your dog is a particular, you can carve on your dog's tombstone.

148
00:16:17,081 --> 00:16:28,360
I remember saying, here lies a particular, but you can't say on your dog's tombstone, here lies an individual in the sense that Kierkegaard uses it, or here's an individual.

149
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:35,561
That's only maybe this is an individual, depending on whether I've got a calling and whether I define myself in terms of it.

150
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,480
And what's the problem?

151
00:16:37,481 --> 00:16:46,601
Well, the translator has no idea what's going on in the book, so he has no idea which translation to use at any given point.

152
00:16:46,601 --> 00:16:55,360
So he just throws in single individual when he feels that the source sentence structure or avoiding repetition makes it nice.

153
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,001
Or he throws in particular or he throws in just plain individual at random.

154
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:12,640
So there's so and that's that you can't say the single individual, that is the one who's done an unconditional commitment is the particular that has its telos in the universal.

155
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,360
See, that's just exactly what it's wrong.

156
00:17:15,841 --> 00:17:18,481
The particular has its telos in the universal.

157
00:17:18,481 --> 00:17:20,640
Now I have to explain what that means.

158
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:33,601
The particular is not only the lectern and your dog, but it's you insofar as you are just another entity or organism or person.

159
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:35,440
I think person would be all right.

160
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,880
Persons, just plain persons are particulars.

161
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,001
And that's because, let's go and look at children.

162
00:17:42,001 --> 00:17:43,521
I mean, that's maybe the way to see it.

163
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:58,720
Children are in lower immediacy because they are always making exceptions of themselves, but not in any fancy way of having a calling, but because they go in for immediate satisfactions and they go after whatever they desire.

164
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:07,841
And everybody begins as a particular with their own impulses and desires and moods and so forth.

165
00:18:07,841 --> 00:18:09,841
That's lower immediacy.

166
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:13,360
And we all start out as particulars.

167
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:20,720
Only unlike dogs and lecterns and so forth, we can get to be individuals.

168
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:29,281
But we have to go through, and now you have this chart where you have to go through mediation, but you don't have to have the chart in front of you.

169
00:18:29,281 --> 00:18:37,120
And now, a new way to put the chart is that you have to go from lower immediacy to mediation.

170
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:44,280
You can also say you have to go from being a particular to subsuming yourself under the universal.

171
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:51,081
That means you have to stop being a child, constantly making exceptions and just trying to get the biggest piece of cake.

172
00:18:51,081 --> 00:19:09,880
And you've got to understand that there are general principles governing human behavior, and you've got to get rid of this sort of selfish, one-sided way of looking at things that all people begin with, and do what any right-thinking person does.

173
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,040
That's that funny sense.

174
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:22,360
Let me just read it again now: seen as an immediate, no more than sensate and psychic being, that means having feelings and ideas in their head.

175
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,841
Why did we put the child?

176
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:28,360
I ever thought of putting it that way.

177
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:33,160
That's sort of not, I mean, that's a little too specific, but it certainly helps understanding.

178
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,200
Get rid of single individual and just put child.

179
00:19:36,521 --> 00:19:53,240
The child is the particular that has its telos in the universal, and the child's ethical task is to express himself in this, to abrogate his particularity, to get over that selfish point of view, so as to become the universal.

180
00:19:53,241 --> 00:19:55,801
And now let's just switch to particular again.

181
00:19:55,801 --> 00:20:08,360
As soon as the particular wants to assert himself in his particularity in opposition to the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.

182
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,760
Okay, that's all we need for the moment.

183
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:18,280
And I'm just catching up with where I am.

184
00:20:18,281 --> 00:20:21,801
Okay, now the next question is: why is the ethical important?

185
00:20:21,801 --> 00:20:30,241
Why, I mean, it's true that your conscience sort of commands you to be ethical and your religion does and so forth.

186
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:39,760
But you might want to say, what sort of role does it play in human life, and why does everybody really want to be ethical?

187
00:20:39,761 --> 00:20:49,280
Well, from Kierkegaard's point of view, and I think he gets it from Hegel, he puts it on page 103.

188
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:53,360
He puts it also in a very fancy Hegel talk.

189
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,561
I don't know which to go first.

190
00:20:54,561 --> 00:20:56,000
I think I better do it 97.

191
00:20:56,001 --> 00:21:04,400
I'm going to tell it to you first in a literal way and then in a metaphorical way, and then maybe you don't need to hear it any other way.

192
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:11,200
In the ethical view of life, then the paragraph that begins on 97.

193
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:21,521
In the ethical view of life, then it is the particular's task to divest himself of the determinant of interiority.

194
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:22,561
That's a new one.

195
00:21:22,561 --> 00:21:31,760
So, lower immediacy and particularity is also now going to be called interiority.

196
00:21:31,761 --> 00:21:42,000
And that means, get the feel for this, the interior are your moods, your desires, your own subjective perspective.

197
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:48,960
And you're supposed to get over your interiority and give it expression in the exterior.

198
00:21:48,961 --> 00:22:05,280
That means find a way of expressing what is universal and everybody can understand it, instead of just having your own peculiar, kinky, idiosyncratic take on things.

199
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:16,681
And now, when the individual shrinks from doing so, whenever he wants to stay inside, to slip back into the inner determinants, and then there's this nice feeling or mood.

200
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,160
You get a hint of what he's talking about there.

201
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,841
He commits an offense, he's in a state of temptation.

202
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:29,480
Okay, let's now let's read the more literary version of the same thing.

203
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:36,200
What I'm trying to say is, well, what's to be gained from getting from the interior to the exterior?

204
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,601
Well, it's intelligibility.

205
00:22:38,601 --> 00:22:50,520
You are able to explain to yourself and everybody else what you're doing and why you're doing it in a way that you can't as long as you're just following your impulses.

206
00:22:50,521 --> 00:22:53,400
And that's the attraction of the ethical.

207
00:22:53,400 --> 00:23:11,640
That's what the Greek philosophers understood, that there was a way of acting that you could understand yourself and everybody else could understand you because what you were doing was what everybody saw to be the right thing, or that you could explain to be the right thing.

208
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,081
So here's how he puts it in this nice form.

209
00:23:15,081 --> 00:23:23,640
In the middle of 103, starting about this third sentence, about five lines down in that big paragraph.

210
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,841
Someone who believes it is a simple enough matter to be the individual.

211
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:29,561
That really is.

212
00:23:29,561 --> 00:23:32,200
You could put a capital I there if you want.

213
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:37,400
The individual can always be certain that he's not a knight of faith.

214
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,960
For stragglers and vagrant geniuses are not men of faith.

215
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,880
Faith, that is, and those are the lower immediacy people.

216
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:51,400
Faith Knight knows that it is glorious to belong to the universal.

217
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,241
Now comes this big metaphor.

218
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:57,920
This is, think about this when you want to see why the ethical is attractive.

219
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:03,601
He knows that it's beautiful and benign to be the particular who translates himself into the universal.

220
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,680
The one who, so to speak, makes a clear and elegant edition of himself.

221
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,040
That's how he gets from the interior to the exterior.

222
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:14,160
As immaculate as possible and readable by all.

223
00:24:14,481 --> 00:24:28,480
He knows it is refreshing to become intelligible to oneself in the universal, so that he understands the universal and everyone who understands him understands the universal through him in turn, and both rejoice in the security of the universal.

224
00:24:29,281 --> 00:24:31,601
That's all fine.

225
00:24:31,601 --> 00:24:52,640
Then, in more general talk, if there has to be some shared public moral vocabulary about what's right and wrong and worthy and unworthy, and then when there is, people can communicate what they're doing and what they should be doing, and people can blame them or approve of them and so forth.

226
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:59,680
Now, there's something that happens, I think, between problem one and two, which is relevant for us.

227
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,721
Problem one is really Kantian.

228
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,241
It just says there is a universal, like, don't kill, don't lie, and so forth.

229
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:11,920
And it applies, he said, remember, everywhere all the time.

230
00:25:12,241 --> 00:25:14,640
But really, we don't believe that anymore.

231
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:35,040
We've seen cultures in which there are so many different varieties, and cultures in which perhaps the best thing you can do is be a clever liar and get away with it, or cultures in which everybody, I mean, I'm not sure there really is such a culture, but supposedly there's a culture called the IC, in which everybody is constantly trying to outwit everybody else.

232
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:43,961
And supposedly, when they see a child crawling toward the fire, instead of rushing to help the child, they all laugh to see the child get burned.

233
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:55,160
I don't know whether there could be such a culture, but let's suppose in that culture you could get credit for how well you managed to set up traps for people and so forth.

234
00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:11,721
But the point is, having seen this diversity of what counts as good and worthy, and maybe even you can't talk about anymore what's right, because what's right, I think Kant is correct about it, is universal.

235
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,601
If there is anything right, everybody's got to do it.

236
00:26:14,601 --> 00:26:16,601
But there's local goods.

237
00:26:16,601 --> 00:26:25,801
What's good for the Greeks isn't the same as what's good for the Hebrews, and isn't the same as what's good for the Athenians, isn't the same as what's good for the Spartans.

238
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:27,960
And now comes problem two.

239
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:38,521
Problem two makes a kind of Hegelian move and switches, instead of talking about the universal, it talks about the inner and outer and about intelligibility.

240
00:26:38,841 --> 00:26:59,081
And that means that as long as there's a shared moral language of discriminating the good from the bad, the worthy from the unworthy, in your peer group, that's all you need in order to become clear, intelligible to yourself and everybody else.

241
00:26:59,081 --> 00:27:05,321
I mean, I think of my, I got my example from Charles Taylor, a philosopher who likes to think and write about these things.

242
00:27:05,321 --> 00:27:16,520
He talks about how a bunch of bikers have their own values and what it is to be tough, for instance, and cruel and so forth.

243
00:27:16,521 --> 00:27:25,520
And it turns out that what it could be that to be manly and tough is the good thing, and to be girlish and weak is a bad thing.

244
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:30,720
But they all understand what's worthy and not worthy.

245
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,040
And they all can justify what they did by saying, well, if he did that, he would have been a sissy.

246
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:42,801
And everybody says, yeah, that's, or he didn't do that, and he was a sissy, and then he gets condemned.

247
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,561
You can see it on every level.

248
00:27:44,561 --> 00:28:03,601
You can see it on the level of the Vikers, or you can see it in what I said at the very first lecture, where I think I said, for the Greeks, the big moral contrast or ethical contrast was heroes and slaves, or heroes and heroes and slavish types.

249
00:28:03,601 --> 00:28:07,040
And that's utterly different than the medieval.

250
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,721
Did I talk about this as the difference between saints and sinners?

251
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,921
I thought I did.

252
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,481
Good.

253
00:28:12,481 --> 00:28:14,801
Okay, so that's just another example.

254
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,401
Heroes are independent, and they don't need any help.

255
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,601
They don't need any God.

256
00:28:22,321 --> 00:28:25,120
They're like gods to the people who need them.

257
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:35,841
And the same heroes, if they were existing in medieval times, and they are in Dante's Inferno, show up in hell because they are rebellious.

258
00:28:35,841 --> 00:28:44,321
They've taken over the, instead of being meek creators, the meek have inherited the earth, as the Bible says.

259
00:28:44,321 --> 00:28:50,321
The meek who, for the Greek point of view, were slavish, are now the good ones up in paradise.

260
00:28:50,321 --> 00:28:57,440
And the ones who were tough and independent and not at all meek, but proud, are at the bottom of the inferno.

261
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,520
There's nothing worse than pride.

262
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:03,200
Achilles had lots of pride, and nobody blamed him for it.

263
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,880
So you get the point.

264
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,360
But it doesn't matter as far as inner and outer is concerned.

265
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:22,920
They are all getting rid of their particularity, their moods, their whims, and all trying to be either heroic and proud or trying to be meek and saintly.

266
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:30,280
And everybody understands what they're trying to do and blames them when they fail at it and praises them when they succeed at it.

267
00:29:30,281 --> 00:29:32,201
And they understand what they're trying to do.

268
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,240
They're making this clear edition of themselves.

269
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:39,321
So you don't need to do this Kantian universal right story.

270
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:49,961
For the intelligibility of it, it's enough that there's a shared sense of what's good, of what's worthy, of what people should be doing and not doing.

271
00:29:50,441 --> 00:29:55,961
That's enough to get you a sense of what you ought to do and you ought to do, and that's what matters.

272
00:29:55,961 --> 00:30:01,801
That matters when you try to justify yourself to yourself and to everybody else.

273
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,920
And that's a 97, and I read it already.

274
00:30:06,921 --> 00:30:13,081
It's how you're going to get outside of these inner determinants of feeling, mood, and so forth.

275
00:30:13,081 --> 00:30:15,001
And now back to 83.

276
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,120
He says it in these different places over and over, but some places better than others.

277
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,321
Now, I'm going to go on where I left off last time.

278
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,160
So it's the individual's task to become the universal.

279
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:45,800
And now we can say, well, whenever you see the universal, you only need to realize it means universal relative to the group of people whose vocabulary and sense of worthiness you grew up in and share.

280
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:53,241
It's that, so the bikers will do, but there has to be some shared sense of what's worthy.

281
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,881
Now, and then I'm going to go back to where I am now.

282
00:30:56,001 --> 00:31:05,840
As soon as the notice in a single individual wrong again, you can either say person or child or particular or whatever helps you understand that.

283
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:10,081
I guess I like this child just for a change.

284
00:31:10,081 --> 00:31:24,481
As soon as the child wants to assert himself in his particularity in direct opposition to the universal, which means what one does, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.

285
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:40,720
Whenever, having entered the universal, the child feels an urge to assert his particularity, he's in a state of temptation from which he can extricate himself only by surrendering his particularity to the universal in repentance.

286
00:31:40,881 --> 00:31:43,601
He's got to admit he's wrong.

287
00:31:43,921 --> 00:31:52,081
Okay, that now I could stop with that for a minute because that's as far, that's the first step.

288
00:31:52,961 --> 00:31:53,920
Do you get that?

289
00:31:53,921 --> 00:31:56,320
I mean, we haven't got any problem yet.

290
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,920
Well, what are we doing in problem one and problem two?

291
00:31:59,921 --> 00:32:03,601
Well, I sort of told you in the first minute what the problem is going to be.

292
00:32:04,961 --> 00:32:11,920
How many see having now that I said all this, what's the big problem he's going to have to head into?

293
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,080
Somebody say it just so I can be sure.

294
00:32:14,081 --> 00:32:14,480
Yeah.

295
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,320
Ethical, but if you have the right.

296
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:30,801
So here you've got this whole story about the ethical, how important it is, how it grounds intelligibility, how it makes you transparent, how it gets you from the inner to the outer, from lower immediacy to the universal in mediation.

297
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:36,801
Everything would be fine, and you could just stick with that if only we had just the Greek culture.

298
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:47,481
But we've got also the Hebraic Christian culture, which is telling us, do your according, even though it makes you an exception and puts you outside the universal.

299
00:32:47,481 --> 00:32:53,081
And now we're going to, Abraham's going to turn out to be, of course, the extreme case of that.

300
00:32:53,081 --> 00:32:56,040
And we have to see what's happening there.

301
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:59,961
How can this, well, let's just do it in Kierkegaard's way.

302
00:33:01,401 --> 00:33:05,001
To begin with, I just want to, yeah, I need to fill in one thing.

303
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,281
Yeah.

304
00:33:07,561 --> 00:33:39,561
Kierkegaard is the main one who sees the conflict between the Hebrew Christian, on the one hand, with individuals becoming unique and exceptions when they've got their calling, and the power of the universal to make you intelligible to yourself and everybody else so you can just know what to do and everybody could see what's the right thing to do and you can tell when you did something wrong and how you have to make up for it.

305
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:42,841
Kierkegaard believes in both of them.

306
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,801
And I just want to run through something which I won't ever get a chance to talk about again.

307
00:33:47,800 --> 00:34:01,961
What makes him particularly interesting to me anyway is that the other existentialists and people generally think existentialists in general, but Kierkegaard is after all the superexistentialists.

308
00:34:01,961 --> 00:34:04,921
He defined what he called existential thinking.

309
00:34:04,921 --> 00:34:18,761
And he's the one who brought the, remember the Hebraic Christian way of looking at things crash into the Greek one and sort of worked out Pascal's view that the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is not the God of the philosophers.

310
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:24,761
Kierkegaard didn't just dump the philosophical Greek perspective.

311
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,200
So I just want to mention that.

312
00:34:26,401 --> 00:34:34,881
When you get to Nietzsche, you'll see that for Nietzsche, the ethical is not a good thing.

313
00:34:34,881 --> 00:34:37,360
It's just, it is just a means to an end.

314
00:34:37,601 --> 00:34:39,281
It makes you stronger.

315
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,241
It's a necessary stage to go through when you sort of outgrow being a child.

316
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:53,360
But when you really get to be a highest-level human being, you leave the ethical behind.

317
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,001
In some ways, that's true in Kierkegaard too.

318
00:34:56,001 --> 00:34:56,881
Why am I...

319
00:34:56,881 --> 00:35:02,481
Ah, but in Kierkegaard, you see that the ethical was a necessarily valuable stage.

320
00:35:02,481 --> 00:35:13,761
And when you leave it behind in Nietzsche, you leave it behind in a way that you sort of look down on it as something that only weak people need.

321
00:35:14,081 --> 00:35:15,920
But I don't want to go into these.

322
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:16,960
I just want you to know.

323
00:35:16,961 --> 00:35:20,961
Heidegger thinks that the ethical is the voice of conformism.

324
00:35:20,961 --> 00:35:23,281
It just tells you what one does.

325
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:26,721
It doesn't tell you what's right or what's good.

326
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,520
Your conscience is just, it's a kind of modern, I guess, Freudian view.

327
00:35:31,521 --> 00:35:40,321
Your superego is just whatever everybody in your peer group tells you, but that doesn't give it any real authority.

328
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,360
Sartre, how many of you, anybody know The Flies, the play, The Flies of Sartre?

329
00:35:45,361 --> 00:36:03,441
Well, in The Flies, Zeus says that he uses the ethical to keep people enslaved because then they, as long as they believe in these religious guidelines, they don't do individual and rebellious things.

330
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,721
And all that is ways of saying, oh, and I forgot Dostoevsky.

331
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,601
How peculiar.

332
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:21,320
Well, Dostoevsky thinks, you'll see when you get to the brothers, that philosophers and philosophy is sick, literally sick.

333
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:28,601
I mean, it's some kind of pathology that he wants to understand, how all these philosophers are running around, particularly in the West.

334
00:36:28,601 --> 00:36:32,280
And Russia is generally free from this kind of disease.

335
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,120
But even there, it has somewhat taken root.

336
00:36:37,001 --> 00:36:48,120
Now, only Kierkegaard has this idea that everybody needs to go through critical reflection to get rid of lower immediacy.

337
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:57,881
And it's not something that's sick or weak or makes you subservient or anything like that.

338
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:05,801
Even when you've got a defining commitment, you still remain completely indebted to the ethical.

339
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:13,001
And in a certain way, you still respect and are called upon to respect.

340
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:22,280
And that means for Kierkegaard there is this big collision if it turns out that your unconditional commitment requires you to go against the ethical.

341
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,521
You can't just say, well, I grew the ethical.

342
00:37:24,521 --> 00:37:25,960
I don't have to think about it anymore.

343
00:37:25,961 --> 00:37:28,520
Or it's only for weak and sick people.

344
00:37:28,521 --> 00:37:33,801
No, the ethical is really unconditional command on you.

345
00:37:34,601 --> 00:37:36,680
It does apply.

346
00:37:37,001 --> 00:37:40,280
And so you get in Kierkegaard a whole.

347
00:37:40,361 --> 00:37:41,881
Now we're in the new problem.

348
00:37:41,881 --> 00:37:53,081
How can you respect the ethical as in a certain way the highest thing people can do, and yet bring in the unconditional commitment as the highest thing people can do?

349
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,801
And of course, the answer is it's going to be what?

350
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,041
What's his word for what happens when this collision occurs?

351
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:04,160
Do you know yet?

352
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,120
You shouldn't really.

353
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,640
So wait till we get there.

354
00:38:07,361 --> 00:38:11,521
He's got a name for the feeling you get when these things collide.

355
00:38:11,521 --> 00:38:13,601
Does anybody recognize it?

356
00:38:13,601 --> 00:38:14,321
What?

357
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,920
No, no, not despair.

358
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,840
That's an important feeling, all right?

359
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:28,160
That's when, let's just review it, the way you're living your life makes it impossible that you were ever happy or you ever could be, like the woman in Hiroshima Manamur.

360
00:38:28,481 --> 00:38:30,960
But we go back to that in the last lecture.

361
00:38:30,961 --> 00:38:32,241
Don't think about that now.

362
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,521
Now, the word is anguish.

363
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:35,921
Every once in a while, and you'll hear about it now.

364
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:42,241
Anguish is the experience of the collision between these two worlds.

365
00:38:42,881 --> 00:38:45,361
I read this once.

366
00:38:45,361 --> 00:38:48,961
That's why you do know it, but I didn't make a fuss about it.

367
00:38:48,961 --> 00:38:53,120
And it's not in your reading, which helps you not know about it.

368
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,241
But I read it.

369
00:38:54,481 --> 00:38:56,001
Where is it?

370
00:38:58,481 --> 00:39:03,680
Only he who knows anguish can experience bliss.

371
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,361
Maybe I can't find it.

372
00:39:05,361 --> 00:39:06,400
Where is the life?

373
00:39:06,401 --> 00:39:08,561
In the lives of the spirit, there's...

374
00:39:08,881 --> 00:39:09,680
Ah, here it is.

375
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,081
It is in your reading on 57.

376
00:39:12,881 --> 00:39:14,000
Right in the middle of the page.

377
00:39:14,001 --> 00:39:16,481
Only one who knows anguish finds rest.

378
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:20,800
But what anguish is exactly is what we're going to get into now.

379
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,041
Yeah.

380
00:39:30,521 --> 00:39:43,640
I mean, even if you like what it is, kind of area, I mean those were the answers, so they kind of things that they always break down in the hypotheticals if you just work on you're unjust for society with opinions of God.

381
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:47,160
And so there are these reasons for doing this opinion that others do exactly.

382
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:53,561
And then you combine that to society with the individual, then the individual will also have a reason.

383
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,361
Yeah, I do, but it's not quite right.

384
00:39:56,921 --> 00:40:00,200
I don't know how to say why I don't think it is until I go on.

385
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,561
And then see if you think that I've answered you.

386
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:21,961
It's interesting what he's saying, that there's going to be a conflict of reasons between the reasons to do something that the person with an unconditional commitment has and the universal reasons or the Hegelian more local peer group reasons.

387
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:25,561
And that's true, sort of.

388
00:40:25,561 --> 00:40:29,000
But Kierkegaard's got a more radical problem than that.

389
00:40:29,001 --> 00:40:31,480
That wouldn't, that I don't think would give you anguish.

390
00:40:31,481 --> 00:40:35,240
That might just give you perplexity.

391
00:40:37,881 --> 00:40:50,601
What you want is something like two absolutely grounded and I like the word respect the ethical, grounded and sort of respectable claims on you.

392
00:40:50,601 --> 00:40:54,200
So let me go on and you'll see how that comes out very quickly.

393
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:01,241
So we need, I think I just read this, but I'm not sure, so I'll read it again.

394
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,200
No, I didn't.

395
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:09,401
Let me one more round now of the Hegel part on 97.

396
00:41:09,561 --> 00:41:16,441
I'm just trying to give you a feeling now of what's good, no, where the problem comes in.

397
00:41:16,441 --> 00:41:20,601
So, we want to get rid of the determinants of mood and so forth.

398
00:41:20,601 --> 00:41:21,160
Okay.

399
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:23,240
Now, now comes the new part.

400
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:29,440
The paradox of faith is this, that there is an interiority that's incommensurable with the exterior.

401
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:37,041
Now, notice, just I hope you realize that this is now, what's the paradox?

402
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:44,881
It's let me say, I'll say it in these versions, and then you see if you can recognize what it was last week.

403
00:41:44,881 --> 00:41:46,160
But it's the same thing.

404
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:59,041
Okay, there is not identical with the, there is a new, sorry, there is an interiority which, it should be stressed, is not identical with the first, that of the child.

405
00:41:59,361 --> 00:42:03,601
That's like me in there, but it is a new interiority.

406
00:42:03,601 --> 00:42:05,920
This is not to be overlooked.

407
00:42:06,081 --> 00:42:10,961
Recent philosophy has allowed itself without ado to substitute the immediate for faith.

408
00:42:11,521 --> 00:42:13,920
Well, what is this new interiority?

409
00:42:13,921 --> 00:42:17,361
You recognize it under a different description?

410
00:42:17,361 --> 00:42:18,160
Exactly.

411
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,120
This is now another name for higher immediacy.

412
00:42:21,601 --> 00:42:37,041
There is something that is above the universal and the ethical that you get to after you've made the movements of reflection and mediation and rationality.

413
00:42:37,041 --> 00:42:40,961
And that's what he wants, that's what he's going to talk about now.

414
00:42:40,961 --> 00:42:42,640
And so, let me go on.

415
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:56,241
If one does, and you can't substitute the immediate for faith, that is, his big enemy here, I have to explain to you, is Hegel, who says Christian faith is just another kind of superstition.

416
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,561
It's a very high-level superstition.

417
00:42:58,561 --> 00:43:00,561
It's a kind of deep superstition.

418
00:43:00,561 --> 00:43:13,001
And when Hegel comes along, he can explain the philosophical and theological meaning behind these biblical stories of God becoming man and people performing miracles and stuff.

419
00:43:11,361 --> 00:43:16,840
That's just lower immediacy.

420
00:43:16,921 --> 00:43:19,561
That's the kind of thing simple people believe.

421
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,281
But faith.

422
00:43:22,921 --> 00:43:28,601
So faith is kind of lower immediacy, Kierkegaard thinks, but Christianity is mediated into philosophy.

423
00:43:28,921 --> 00:43:33,081
That's Hegel's big job, to show the philosophical truth in it.

424
00:43:33,081 --> 00:43:36,761
Now, Kierkegaard thinks that's just terribly wrong.

425
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,920
That's to get the whole Judeo-Christian tradition mishmashed into the Greek.

426
00:43:40,921 --> 00:43:41,880
It just continues.

427
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:50,200
Hegel, remember, I put it on the board, is the last of the philosophers, starting with Plato, and then there's Aristotle, then there's St.

428
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:57,560
Thomas Aquinas, and then there's Descartes, and then there's Kant, and all of them, and then there was Hegel.

429
00:43:58,041 --> 00:44:05,001
And they're all trying to put the Judeo-Christian thing into Greek terms, and thereby always losing it.

430
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,881
And the last, and they always get an enemy.

431
00:44:07,881 --> 00:44:19,481
So Pascal, so Pascal, Descartes gives rise to Pascal denying the God of the philosophers is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

432
00:44:19,481 --> 00:44:24,761
And then, jumping ahead, Hegel gives rise to Kierkegaard.

433
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:34,601
The one that Kant gives rise to is a guy named Haman, but he's so obscure that it doesn't do any good to, Kant was such a heavy, nobody stood up to him.

434
00:44:34,601 --> 00:44:37,481
To this day, they haven't managed to stand up to him.

435
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:52,440
And then Hegel gives rise to Kierkegaard, and what Kierkegaard rejects in Hegel is to claim that Christian faith is lower immediacy, but it can be mediated into Hegelian philosophy.

436
00:44:52,441 --> 00:44:55,241
So he goes on, he says, let me go on.

437
00:44:55,561 --> 00:45:02,081
Recent philosophy, that's Hegel, has allowed itself without ado to substitute the immediate for faith.

438
00:45:02,081 --> 00:45:07,201
That is, they stick faith down along with moods and superstitions and so forth.

439
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,321
If one does that, it is ridiculous to deny that faith has existed through all ages.

440
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,800
That is, there's always been plenty of lower immediacy.

441
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,921
Faith in such cases keeps fairly ordinary company.

442
00:45:17,921 --> 00:45:20,721
And there's a great list here of lower immediacy.

443
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:26,961
It belongs with feeling, mood, idiosyncrasy, hysteria, and the rest.

444
00:45:26,961 --> 00:45:35,441
Insofar, so far, philosophy is right to say one should not stop at that, should not stop at lower immediacy.

445
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:41,441
But there is nothing to warrant philosophy speaking in this manner, that in this manner.

446
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,120
Wait, what's happening?

447
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:50,241
So, philosophy is right to say one shouldn't stop at that, these lower things, hysteria, mood, feeling.

448
00:45:50,561 --> 00:45:54,001
But there is nothing to warrant philosophy speaking in this manner.

449
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:58,081
That is, that there is something higher than faith.

450
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,001
No, I can't read any more of it.

451
00:46:00,001 --> 00:46:00,800
It doesn't help.

452
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,840
It's not clear.

453
00:46:02,081 --> 00:46:04,480
But anyway, I hope you get it.

454
00:46:05,361 --> 00:46:18,400
What's happening is that faith isn't something you can subsume philosophically, like Hegel, and say faith is a part of lower immediacy.

455
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:20,081
It's just superstition.

456
00:46:20,081 --> 00:46:26,001
And you have to outgrow it and go through the ethical and the philosophical.

457
00:46:26,001 --> 00:46:27,120
Then you get something.

458
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:34,881
But you don't get higher immediacy, you get just get higher philosophy, which finally, that's Hegel, supposedly captures all you need.

459
00:46:34,881 --> 00:46:39,201
And Kierkegaard's big thing is: no, there's something higher.

460
00:46:39,200 --> 00:47:00,761
And so, at the bottom of 97, then faith paradox is this: that the individual with a capital I is higher than the universal, that the individual determines his relation to the universal through his relation to the absolute, not his relation to the absolute through his relation to the universal.

461
00:47:02,921 --> 00:47:05,561
Enough, I think, for a moment.

462
00:47:05,561 --> 00:47:08,201
Let me fill you in first.

463
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,320
Okay, well, then I let you go.

464
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,680
I feel I lost you, sort of there.

465
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:13,720
That's why I worry.

466
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,320
So, anybody want to say anything?

467
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,921
Probably I lost you because nobody's had a chance to say anything.

468
00:47:18,921 --> 00:47:21,640
And so, are you with it?

469
00:47:23,561 --> 00:47:41,801
What I need to now is to tell you, but once this is clear, sort of how, and I'm still answering him too, how Kierkegaard sees this clash between the individual and the universal as something much more serious than anybody has ever thought it was before.

470
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,120
Yeah.

471
00:47:58,441 --> 00:47:59,640
Good question.

472
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:03,401
Can this kind of, I'll say it repeat, repeat it for the podcast.

473
00:48:03,401 --> 00:48:10,361
Couldn't somebody's understanding of right and wrong be determined by their unconditional commitment?

474
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:15,721
No, but I haven't really explained that.

475
00:48:16,041 --> 00:48:18,521
Let me see where to begin.

476
00:48:18,561 --> 00:48:40,081
I mean, it's part of the notion of your calling or your unconditional commitment that it's just for you and it's something that you can't explain in the terms of the shared peer group culture.

477
00:48:40,401 --> 00:48:42,561
One, I'll give you sort of bits of it.

478
00:48:42,561 --> 00:48:52,721
Remember when we talked about the defining commitment in the romantic love story, that the one you love isn't sort of objectively lovable.

479
00:48:52,720 --> 00:49:04,401
It isn't as if you can give reasons why you love them so that everybody ought to love them because they are the wittiest and the sexiest and the smartest and so forth.

480
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,720
Then you wouldn't really be loving them.

481
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,721
You'd be just loving a type.

482
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:16,001
And the idea is that any kind of commitment is unique.

483
00:49:16,001 --> 00:49:25,521
But you're forcing me to say something interesting, which I don't know if I could have said it before, but it's just exactly what Skirpigard's thinking about.

484
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,601
I've got to try to answer in this.

485
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:36,160
It isn't that an unconditional commitment needs to go against the ethical.

486
00:49:36,481 --> 00:49:40,960
You might reconcile your unconditional commitment with the ethical.

487
00:49:40,961 --> 00:49:49,760
So when I use Martin Luther King as an example, I'm always feeling uneasy because Martin Luther King's unconditional commitment is intelligible.

488
00:49:49,760 --> 00:50:00,881
He can explain it to everybody, and he uses the Christian shared understanding of the good and the justice understanding and the democracy and so forth.

489
00:50:00,881 --> 00:50:05,281
But, and this is the move I haven't made clearly, but I'll make it now.

490
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,120
The unconditional commitment could cause you to go against the ethical.

491
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:15,160
That is, in answer to you, it might be that you could reconcile it with your peer group's values.

492
00:50:15,481 --> 00:50:21,721
But, and this, it's always got in it the possibility of suspending the ethical.

493
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:29,001
That means it's always got in it the possibility that it will call you to do something that is not ethical.

494
00:50:29,001 --> 00:50:31,721
And Kierkegaard is interested in that.

495
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:51,720
He's interested in the frame of mind of a person whose unconditional commitment is forcing them, and this is the crucial thing, to do something that is unintelligible, that they can't explain to themselves or anybody else.

496
00:50:51,961 --> 00:50:54,041
You exactly force me to that.

497
00:50:55,081 --> 00:50:58,440
He doesn't care about the fact that sometimes it will go your way.

498
00:50:58,441 --> 00:51:13,881
What he cares about is that it could possibly happen that somebody could be called to do something which, from their own point of view, was completely unethical and immoral, and called to do it by their unconditional commitment.

499
00:51:13,881 --> 00:51:22,601
Now, now I think the reason that he and he have both not seen it is because they're right.

500
00:51:22,601 --> 00:51:25,241
I haven't said it clearly enough yet.

501
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,561
What I haven't done is given you the phenomenon.

502
00:51:27,561 --> 00:51:28,680
So, I'm going to do that.

503
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,760
No more talks about Kant and Hegel.

504
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:34,441
Let's talk about what it's like to experience something like this.

505
00:51:34,441 --> 00:51:39,160
So, my, I mean, and that's how you have to read these books, remember.

506
00:51:39,881 --> 00:51:54,841
This crazy idea of Abraham being ready to kill his son and thereby become a murderer, and that he is both knows that he's a murderer and at the same time knows that this is the thing he has to do.

507
00:51:54,840 --> 00:52:02,561
First, let me read it in terms of Abraham, but then I'm going to give you real examples in real life because that's the only way you'll understand it.

508
00:52:05,041 --> 00:52:09,201
So, what we want is a place where an Abraham talks to himself.

509
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:14,160
He has to say to himself, because it's the only language he's got, that he's a murderer.

510
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,041
Help me find it.

511
00:52:15,921 --> 00:52:23,441
And that's when the crunch comes, and when Abraham looks like something absolutely incomprehensible.

512
00:52:24,001 --> 00:52:29,680
Okay, well, right after the beautiful, elegant edition on 103, I'm going to go on.

513
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:40,160
He knows it is beautiful to be born in the particular with the universal as his home, his friendly abode, which receives him straight away with open arms when he wishes to stay there.

514
00:52:40,481 --> 00:52:43,841
That is when he goes from being a particular to being universal.

515
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:49,201
But he also knows that higher up there winds a lonely path, narrow and steep.

516
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:55,601
He knows it's terrible to be born in solitude outside the universal, to walk without meeting a traveler.

517
00:52:55,601 --> 00:52:59,921
He knows very well where he is and how he's related to men.

518
00:52:59,921 --> 00:53:05,041
Humanly speaking, he is insane and cannot make himself understood by anyone.

519
00:53:05,041 --> 00:53:08,081
And yet, insane is the mildest expression for him.

520
00:53:08,081 --> 00:53:22,480
Now, I just want the place where he just nails it and says, whenever Abraham tries to say to himself what he's doing, he can't say anything to himself about what he's doing, except that he's a murderer, because that's the.

521
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,120
Here I am, at the top of 95.

522
00:53:25,441 --> 00:53:30,241
So Abraham's story contains a teleological suspension of the ethical.

523
00:53:32,481 --> 00:53:35,361
Let's start a little before, at the bottom of 94.

524
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,320
And now I return to Abraham.

525
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:44,520
In the time before the outcome, either Abraham was a murderer every minute or we stay with the paradox and so forth.

526
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:49,001
So Abraham's story contains a teleological suspension of the ethical.

527
00:53:49,001 --> 00:53:57,081
See, it's not just an ethical that's higher or that's based on his understanding of what is best for his peer group.

528
00:53:57,481 --> 00:54:03,240
It's a suspension of the ethical, meaning the ethical is no longer the highest thing.

529
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,761
There is something higher.

530
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:08,440
He has, as the individual, become higher than the universal.

531
00:54:08,441 --> 00:54:11,081
This is the paradox which cannot be mediated.

532
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:14,601
How he got into it is just as inexplicable as how he stayed in it.

533
00:54:14,601 --> 00:54:20,120
If this is not how it is with Abraham, then it is not even a tragic healer, but a murderer.

534
00:54:22,521 --> 00:54:23,880
And why isn't he a murderer?

535
00:54:23,881 --> 00:54:27,001
Oh, well, I've got to find a place.

536
00:54:27,001 --> 00:54:31,081
You guys should help me, but I don't know why I can't just find it.

537
00:54:31,481 --> 00:54:35,561
I'll look at my notes in a minute, but that seems like a desperate thing to do.

538
00:54:35,561 --> 00:54:38,041
I have to be able to just see it.

539
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:51,721
See, what I want to find is when Kierkegaard says, and he's got to say it, that when Abraham talks to himself and tries to make intelligible what he's doing, he's only got the shared ethical language.

540
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:55,640
And the shared ethical language says you're a murderer.

541
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,120
What page?

542
00:54:58,441 --> 00:54:59,320
39?

543
00:54:59,961 --> 00:55:00,760
89?

544
00:55:01,401 --> 00:55:02,280
89.

545
00:55:02,601 --> 00:55:03,320
Okay.

546
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:05,880
I owe you great thanks if that's where it is.

547
00:55:05,881 --> 00:55:07,880
And I don't know how I keep missing it.

548
00:55:09,081 --> 00:55:13,480
Well, that's close because it says Abraham cannot be mediated at the top.

549
00:55:13,481 --> 00:55:14,921
He cannot speak.

550
00:55:15,481 --> 00:55:18,120
The moment he speaks, he expresses the universal.

551
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,320
Does it say the murderer?

552
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,760
That's the right thing, all right.

553
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,561
But does it say it later down or somewhere?

554
00:55:23,561 --> 00:55:24,360
But that's right.

555
00:55:24,361 --> 00:55:29,281
When he speaks, he has to keep silent because if he asks himself, well, what are you doing?

556
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,160
He can only say that he's a murderer.

557
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,240
If I can't find it right now, it doesn't matter.

558
00:55:34,561 --> 00:55:38,241
I say it's on 95 or on 103.

559
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,280
Let's look and see.

560
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,321
Now, we did 95, and it wasn't there.

561
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:48,481
And now I want to go 103, top of 102.

562
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,920
Yes, I guess so.

563
00:55:49,921 --> 00:55:52,881
And there he is, and remains a murderer.

564
00:55:52,881 --> 00:55:57,200
Okay, that's better than anyone I found, and I'm going to mark it.

565
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,120
But I thought there was one in which it says when he talks to himself, he can only say.

566
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,520
I mean, it's implied in everything that we've read.

567
00:56:03,521 --> 00:56:08,401
But I thought I would find a place where he just said it outright, and I haven't found it yet.

568
00:56:08,401 --> 00:56:16,640
Okay, we know that he's a murderer, that he's insane, that he can't speak, because if he said anything to himself, he'd be a murderer.

569
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:23,521
Okay, what I want to do now, because I feel otherwise I will lose you, is what's the phenomenon?

570
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:28,800
Is this just sort of psychological, theological, science fiction or something?

571
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:47,601
Do people ever get in the position in which what's calling them to do something is something they feel that it's the most right thing they could ever do, the best thing that makes their life worth living, and that it is the most awful thing that they're just totally despicable if they do it.

572
00:56:47,601 --> 00:56:54,481
Well, I think there's an easy example, and I think it's fascinating because it may even be a true example.

573
00:56:54,481 --> 00:57:03,201
But think now what it would be like to be a homosexual in 1850 in Copenhagen, which Kierkegaard may well have been.

574
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,000
Nobody knows why he couldn't marry Regina.

575
00:57:06,001 --> 00:57:14,281
He wrote notes about it in his journal and called it the thorn in his flesh that prevented it, and he tore out those pages and burned them or something.

576
00:57:14,601 --> 00:57:19,561
But he did show up dressed up like a dandy in the intermissions of operas.

577
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,321
He was very weird.

578
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:29,960
But in any case, suppose he was gay, and suppose, just I don't know if there's any, there's no evidence for this, that he loved some guy.

579
00:57:29,961 --> 00:57:31,721
Let's call him John.

580
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:38,761
Now, Kierkegaard is then exactly in the position of Abraham.

581
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:49,481
That is, the best thing he can do is be with this guy, and it is, and what does he have to say to himself if he uses any language?

582
00:57:49,481 --> 00:57:56,521
It's despicable, it's unnatural, it's depraved, it's disgusting, it's whatever.

583
00:57:56,521 --> 00:58:01,321
He has a whole lot of words he can use to describe what he's doing, but they're all awful.

584
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:05,640
They're all, nobody would do such a thing, and here he is doing it.

585
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:09,961
And that's the situation that really can happen to people.

586
00:58:09,961 --> 00:58:19,561
It happens to us that we're looking at it from the point of view of Berkeley in 2000-something after gay liberation and all that.

587
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,201
It isn't a problem anymore.

588
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:39,160
But it was a problem even when 50 years ago, when I was in high school and graduate school, it was a big deal whether people came out or kept secret this depraved and disgusting side of their lives.

589
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:44,681
And now you can see why Kierkegaard thinks that's important, whether it was in his life or not.

590
00:58:45,001 --> 00:59:01,441
There is a possible situation in which, for the people who are in it, the ethical comes up, crash against their calling, their sense of what's the most important, meaningful thing in their life that has the highest authority in their life.

591
00:59:01,441 --> 00:59:03,120
And then they both have authority.

592
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:06,241
It isn't as if, and that's why I say it's stronger than what he said.

593
00:59:07,921 --> 00:59:11,921
It isn't as if just that there's two different reasons going on.

594
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:19,761
There's only one reason, the ethical reason, which said this is depraved and unnatural, disgusting, pervert, you're a pervert.

595
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:24,321
And there is the feeling that this is the best thing I ever did.

596
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,160
Okay, I've got another one now.

597
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:33,681
And I used to go on about what it would be like to be a child raised by the Nazis who wanted to save a Jew.

598
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:48,880
But I think now, and then maybe you could tell the same story, I'm sure, in some form about suicide bombers and how somebody who could, maybe somebody could be called to be a suicide bomber and at the same time know that that made them a murderer.

599
00:59:48,881 --> 00:59:49,681
I don't know.

600
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:56,080
But the best one, somebody sent me one day, last time I gave it, that's the greatness of podcasts.

601
00:59:56,401 --> 01:00:04,481
Nobody had ever told me this in our own American tradition, in what might be, some people think the best American novel ever.

602
01:00:04,481 --> 01:00:06,720
I think second place to Moby Dick.

603
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,080
But anyway, a good one, and that's Huckleberry Finn.

604
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,560
How many of you read Huckleberry Finn?

605
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,961
You recognize what I'm talking about as the suspension of the ethical?

606
01:00:16,961 --> 01:00:17,760
Jim does it.

607
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,400
You don't have to be Abraham or a Kierkegaard.

608
01:00:20,401 --> 01:00:21,921
So I'm going to read it.

609
01:00:21,921 --> 01:00:25,920
It's about whether he's going to turn Jim in or not.

610
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:34,001
And he starts to turn him in, and then he lies to some slave hunters and sends them away.

611
01:00:34,001 --> 01:00:36,160
And then I'm going to read two quotes from him.

612
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:43,881
They went off and got aboard the raft, and I got aboard the raft feeling bad and low because I knowed very well I had done wrong.

613
01:00:41,361 --> 01:00:48,360
And I see it weren't no use for me to try to learn to do right.

614
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:54,601
A body that don't get started right when he's a little, when he's little, ain't got no show.

615
01:00:54,601 --> 01:00:57,160
When the pinch comes, there ain't nothing to back him up.

616
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,681
And so he gets beat.

617
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:01,320
Then I thought a minute and I says to myself, hold on.

618
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:04,041
Suppose you've done the right thing and given Jim up.

619
01:01:04,041 --> 01:01:06,840
Would you felt better about what you do now?

620
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,200
No, says I.

621
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,001
I'd feel bad.

622
01:01:09,001 --> 01:01:11,321
I'd feel just the same way I do now.

623
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,761
I mean, this is about anguish.

624
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:19,561
This is about the fact that he's caught between knowing that whatever he does, he's done something terrible.

625
01:01:19,561 --> 01:01:21,320
If he turns Jim in, it would be terrible.

626
01:01:21,881 --> 01:01:22,760
And he knows that.

627
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:34,681
And then he realizes, I mean, first he knows that if he lies to protect Jim, it's terrible because that makes him, well, I guess a very, very, very bad thing, a slave protector.

628
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,760
Or if he gives Jim in, it's bad.

629
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,280
So here he tries it again.

630
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:39,720
After writing a letter to Mrs.

631
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:48,921
Watson that he's got her possession, namely Jim, I took it up and I held it, that's the letter betraying Jim, in my hand.

632
01:01:48,921 --> 01:01:54,040
I was a trembling because I got to decide forever betwixt two things and I knowed it.

633
01:01:54,041 --> 01:01:55,240
I studied a minute.

634
01:01:55,240 --> 01:02:01,480
I sort of hold my breath and then I said to myself, all right then, I'll go to hell, and tore it up.

635
01:02:01,481 --> 01:02:04,601
That's like Abraham saying, okay, then I'm a murderer.

636
01:02:05,001 --> 01:02:11,241
It was awful thoughts, awful words, but they were said, and I let them stay said, and that's it.

637
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:18,841
So, okay, so there, I mean, it's great that it's there because it's not, that just shows that it's something that can happen.

638
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:28,241
Of course, again, we're looking back from the fact that now we don't think it's a big problem because we don't think people should turn in slaves and have slaves and so forth.

639
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:31,841
But you'd have to find something now.

640
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:35,521
But if you found something now, I don't know what it would be.

641
01:02:35,521 --> 01:02:38,241
If anybody does, they can write an A-plus paper.

642
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:48,321
It would have to be something that we all agree is so bad that it's unintelligible it could ever become good.

643
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:52,801
That's what it would be like if somebody was in it now.

644
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:59,920
And yet somebody was doing it because they couldn't help but feel that it was the best thing they ever did.

645
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,520
Now, it gets very interesting at this point.

646
01:03:03,521 --> 01:03:04,800
But now it's time.

647
01:03:05,921 --> 01:03:08,160
I'm going to not do that part.

648
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,200
I'm going to stick to this.

649
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,320
But I'll tell you what's interesting.

650
01:03:10,401 --> 01:03:12,160
I'm going to start with it next time.

651
01:03:12,481 --> 01:03:19,041
You will want to ask yourself, but if you did find one like it, how could you tell whether they were just crazy?

652
01:03:19,041 --> 01:03:19,601
Well, I can't.

653
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,120
I have to go on with this.

654
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:26,481
So, I mean, it isn't as if just any crazy will do is an example.

655
01:03:26,481 --> 01:03:34,640
You can't take the shining and say the Jack Nicholson character who's been reading Kierkegaard and is setting out to kill his son is doing this.

656
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,841
But the question is, why not?

657
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,800
Or there's another movie I mentioned called Bigger Than Life.

658
01:03:41,041 --> 01:03:46,320
These are movies you should take out and watch where the guy has been reading Kierkegaard again and sets out to kill his son.

659
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:49,841
This happens apparently in the best of families every once in a while.

660
01:03:52,561 --> 01:04:02,880
But there's got to be, Kierkegaard says, some kind of criteria that you can tell a knight of faith from a crazy.

661
01:04:03,201 --> 01:04:10,160
And I'm not going to tell you what it is, although in a certain sense I have told you what it is, but I haven't, I'm not going to tell you in the sense in which I've already told you.

662
01:04:10,161 --> 01:04:18,441
So I'm going to go back for the last five minutes, though, and I'll start, you think about it, and I'll start next time with what he calls the criteria.

663
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:25,960
If you're reading carefully, you'll see a point where he says, well, we've got to give some criteria so we can tell the knights of faith from the loonies.

664
01:04:26,281 --> 01:04:28,040
Okay, let's see now.

665
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,521
So where are we?

666
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:38,441
Well, Greek philosophical categories have no way to distinguish unconditional commitment from sin.

667
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:41,960
No way to distinguish faith from sin.

668
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:43,160
Oh, that's interesting.

669
01:04:43,161 --> 01:04:45,880
Yeah, maybe I should, I'm going to say that till next time, too.

670
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:54,680
So the Greek conflict is sort of out in the open in Kierkegaard, where it never was in the history of the culture up to then.

671
01:04:54,680 --> 01:05:00,360
Although people had always been stuck in these two worlds, mostly they didn't notice it.

672
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:04,040
They thought they lived in one coherent world.

673
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:09,720
Now, let's do one more thing in the next five minutes, and I won't be coming back to that.

674
01:05:10,601 --> 01:05:26,601
And of course, he says, if you really understand this, it'll keep you awake at night because you will have this terrible thing that some people will, and maybe you will, be called upon to do things which go directly against the ethical the way Abraham was.

675
01:05:27,241 --> 01:05:32,760
And over here's the middle of 60 is a place sort of close to what I was looking for.

676
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,920
Abraham was willing to murder Isaac.

677
01:05:36,441 --> 01:05:42,040
But the point is that Abraham has to say to himself that he's a murderer.

678
01:05:42,121 --> 01:05:43,561
That's the homosexual example.

679
01:05:43,561 --> 01:05:46,200
He has to say to himself that he's a pervert.

680
01:05:46,201 --> 01:05:51,401
And notice that Huck says, I'm going to hell.

681
01:05:51,401 --> 01:05:53,080
I'm a bad person.

682
01:05:53,321 --> 01:05:56,201
And he doesn't, he can't, there's no way outside of that.

683
01:05:56,401 --> 01:05:58,240
He has no way of denying that.

684
01:05:58,241 --> 01:06:00,160
He asked if he really believes it.

685
01:06:00,161 --> 01:06:04,000
Okay, but I want to do the other because I don't want to go back to it.

686
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,760
And that's the tragic hero.

687
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,401
Because the tragic hero is really what he invented.

688
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:09,680
You back there.

689
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,240
Sort of.

690
01:06:10,241 --> 01:06:33,601
A tragic hero manages to do a deed which, it turns out, can be reconciled, where his commitment is a kind of commitment which has a kind of universal instead of an individual component in it, which puts him in tune with the universal instead of requiring him to go against the universe.

691
01:06:33,601 --> 01:06:35,200
What would that be like?

692
01:06:35,201 --> 01:06:37,680
Well, that's like the tragic hero.

693
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:42,400
The story of Agamemnon comes in here, then Kierkegaard tells it.

694
01:06:42,401 --> 01:06:50,800
And the story of Agamemnon is that, and I have been, how many know what happens with Agamemnon and Ephigenia?

695
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:51,920
Okay, not very many.

696
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,720
I can end with that, and then I'll start with the next.

697
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,160
Oh, but I'll tell you the story.

698
01:06:56,481 --> 01:07:02,640
This is from, it's in the Orestea, I guess is the main place it is.

699
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:06,160
But it's one of the Greek myths that is important.

700
01:07:06,161 --> 01:07:18,800
So when Helen runs off with this attractive stranger, Paris, I can't resist saying because what she does is in a certain sense all right.

701
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:25,200
Aphrodite shines on her, and when Aphrodite shines on anything, the situation becomes purely erotic.

702
01:07:25,201 --> 01:07:32,240
And this so that she ran off and left her husband and child when Paris came to stay overnight at their house, at their palace.

703
01:07:32,241 --> 01:07:38,880
And the interesting thing is, in Homer, nobody blames her because moods are like gods and you're supposed to do them.

704
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,280
But that's for another, that's my other course.

705
01:07:41,561 --> 01:07:42,760
Let's stick to this one.

706
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,521
She runs off with Paris.

707
01:07:44,521 --> 01:07:52,760
Agamemnon, the brother of the, no, no, Agamemnon.

708
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:54,920
Menelaus is married to Helen.

709
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:57,800
Helen runs off with Paris.

710
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,680
Agamemnon is the brother of Menelaus.

711
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:09,320
And Agamemnon has sworn to protect his brother, and they've sworn brotherly truce, like a brotherly oath to help each other.

712
01:08:09,321 --> 01:08:17,000
So it looks like now Menelaus, or Agamemnon, has to run off and help Menelaus get Helen back.

713
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:28,920
And when he organizes, and he's the commander-in-chief now, Agamemnon, he organizes all his forces, and they get as far as an island out a little way from, where are they, in Ithaca?

714
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:30,360
Yeah, in Ithaca.

715
01:08:30,361 --> 01:08:35,880
And they, and all of a sudden, there's no wind, and they're stuck.

716
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,200
And for days and days, they're stuck.

717
01:08:38,201 --> 01:08:44,840
And the prophet comes and says, unless you kill your daughter Ephigenia, your men will be stuck there forever.

718
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:48,360
And they're beginning to get sick, and they're beginning to get hungry.

719
01:08:48,361 --> 01:08:51,320
And so he's got a big problem.

720
01:08:51,321 --> 01:08:57,400
And then he sees that he's got to kill Ephigenia.

721
01:08:57,401 --> 01:09:01,000
And he also loves her.

722
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:06,200
And the way Kierkegaard puts it, she's his favorite daughter and all that.

723
01:09:06,521 --> 01:09:13,160
And so he's in sort of the situation of Abraham killing Isaac, except, and he does it.

724
01:09:13,161 --> 01:09:14,601
He kills the daughter.

725
01:09:14,601 --> 01:09:22,521
And instead of everybody thinking that he's a murderer, or he thinking that he's a murderer, everybody thinks, including him, that what he did was intelligible.

726
01:09:22,521 --> 01:09:35,360
He subsumed one ethical, namely, or two, maybe, don't kill, and secondly, it's your duty to love and protect your children under a higher ethical, do your duty as king.

727
01:09:35,361 --> 01:09:42,561
And his duty was to get the, as commander-in-chief, to get those troops off the island and over to Troy to get Helen back.

728
01:09:42,561 --> 01:10:00,800
And everybody celebrates the fact that his unconditional commitment was to be king, which is a universal role, and it called him to do the ethical thing, namely to kill Ephigenia, and he did it.

729
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,481
I'll say one more thing because it's so timely.

730
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:15,840
Nobody knows except me, and now you will know, why in the world the prophet required Agamemnon to kill his daughter in order to get his troops off to Troy.

731
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:21,601
I had a colleague, he died here about six months ago, who understood that.

732
01:10:21,601 --> 01:10:29,441
He wrote a book called Agamemnon and Other Losers, but he explained what it was.

733
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:43,120
The answer is: what the Prophet understands is that if you're going to send other people's children off to die in the war, you have to be ready to send your own children off to die in the war.

734
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:52,800
Bush wants the young people to go off and die in Iraq, then if he had children of draftable age, they'd have to be drafted.

735
01:10:52,800 --> 01:11:06,880
So Agamemnon has to, in effect, show that he's willing to sacrifice his child to have the right to ask all the other citizens to sacrifice their children.

736
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:18,840
And when he does it, it shows that he's ready to sacrifice his child for promoting the war as commander-in-chief and so forth, then they get off the island and everything comes out all right.

737
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:20,521
And what's the moral of this?

738
01:11:20,521 --> 01:11:26,040
Tragic heroes go to subsume one ethical under another.

739
01:11:26,361 --> 01:11:30,601
That's their way of they don't suspend the ethical.

740
01:11:30,601 --> 01:11:38,120
They just suspend the one ethical, love, take care of your daughter, under a higher ethical, do your job as king.

741
01:11:38,521 --> 01:11:40,040
And that's utterly different.

742
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:42,040
And then they become completely intelligible.

743
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:49,481
That's utterly different than what Abraham does and what Vierkegaard, if he's homosexual, does and what Huck does.

744
01:11:51,401 --> 01:11:59,320
They subsume the whole ethical under something which is unintelligible from the point of view of that ethical and there's no other point of view.

745
01:11:59,321 --> 01:12:03,400
And that's the paradox and that's the anguish.

746
01:12:03,401 --> 01:12:06,441
Okay, now we're ready for the next stage.
