00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,280
Okay, we're going to talk about the self, and we're going to give a view of the self that is the Christian view of the self, and it's the view that is sort of covered up for the long time in Christianity by all this Greek philosophy and the gods of the philosophers getting in there.

2
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:26,519
It's Pascal who first sort of announces the Christian view of the self, the Judeo-Christian, which has been there all along.

3
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:45,319
But first, let's go back to the Greek view, because it's the Greek view that's been there covering up the Christian view because the Greek gods of the philosopher got mixed into Christianity very early on with Saint Augustine in 300 AD.

4
00:00:45,319 --> 00:00:49,720
Interestingly enough, the Russian Orthodox don't count Augustine as a saint.

5
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:57,319
I think that's a good idea because he's a big contributor to not messing up this understanding.

6
00:00:57,319 --> 00:00:58,440
So here we go.

7
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:21,240
In the Platonic tradition, of which Augustine is unfortunately a big example, it was understood that human beings were an unstable combination of body and soul, of time, the body was in time, and eternity, the soul contemplated eternal truth.

8
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:34,839
And the idea was that to make this unstable combination stable, so you could lead a happy and harmonious life, you had to find out which part was essential and just get rid of the other part.

9
00:01:34,839 --> 00:02:01,079
If your commitment to being involved in the world and getting the most out of having a body gets in the way of your contemplating eternal otherworldly forms, then you've either got to get rid of the otherworldly forms and enjoy having a body, or play down having a body and enjoy the bliss of contemplating eternal truth.

10
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:13,279
So, and Plato says you have to die to your body if you're a philosopher, so that you can have your head clear, so to speak, to think, to do your philosophy.

11
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:19,360
And Lucretius, just to give you an example that you're going to need later, you can go either way.

12
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:26,959
I mean, the body is a combination, each of us is a combination of a soul or mind and a body.

13
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,480
And given that we're this combination, you have two choices.

14
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:43,680
Since you don't fit well together, and you won't have a harmonious life if you've got these two contradictory impulses, you have to make live a life in which one or the other is essential and play down the other.

15
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:53,600
So I just gave you the Plato, Augustine, medieval Christian one: you play down the body and you go devote yourself to having a soul.

16
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,879
But there are others, of course, materialists who think opposite.

17
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:08,879
Lucretius, Roman philosopher, poet, I'm just using him as an example.

18
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,560
I mean, you don't have to know anything about Lucretius whatsoever, but I'll write it on the board so it isn't mysterious.

19
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:32,319
Okay, well, his idea was that we're just made out of atoms juggling or jiggling around, and that what he wanted to do was get your body in the best possible condition for these atoms jiggling around in a harmonious and pleasant way.

20
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,720
And that didn't mean having orgies.

21
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,719
That would be not a good kind of jiggling around.

22
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:44,000
It would be too, but it meant eating nice food and talking in pleasant places with pleasant friends.

23
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:45,599
You could give your own story.

24
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:51,480
But the idea was to get the most out of the kind of natural material body that you are.

25
00:03:51,800 --> 00:04:01,160
And what did he think about all this Greek, all this Platonic stuff about the truth in the other world that was eternal and so forth?

26
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:06,360
Well, he thought it was just superstition, and that what you had to do was sort of talk yourself out of it.

27
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:12,760
And it was just a kind of bad dream that you got in the way of leading a pleasant way of life.

28
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,040
You don't want them.

29
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,319
You don't want these superstitions to guide you.

30
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:26,440
And they would get in the way of your natural needs and natural pleasures if you didn't get rid of them.

31
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,920
Okay, so that's the story.

32
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:59,880
And once you realize that you're essentially an eternal soul combined with a temporal body, then, and that you only have to identify yourself with one or the other, you get out of this conflict and this instability, sort of thrashing back and forth, and you tend to lead a happy, harmonious life as long as you live as if you were one or the other of the set of factors.

33
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:04,680
Now, I want to skip something, but I have to see how far I'm supposed to skip.

34
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:13,079
And what you're a life, living a life is a kind of voyage from confusion to clarity, from conflict to harmony.

35
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:25,319
When you live your life right, by the time you get to be old and wise, you have stopped having these contradictory impulses, and you have a harmonious life.

36
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:44,240
You realize whatever it is you take your true nature to be, and you get rid of whatever you take your unessential desires to be, and you satisfy the essential needs and desires, and you just get rid of the superficial, the wrong needs and desires.

37
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:50,640
Okay, and that gives you, I said, harmony, happiness, in other words, for it, peace gives you fulfillment.

38
00:05:50,640 --> 00:06:02,959
All this talk about peace being so important, and the prayer you, you know, peace, people say, in lots of Christian and Hebrew prayers and services and so forth.

39
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:11,840
That's a very Greek idea that what you really want is peace and harmony, and that when you lead a good life in the right way, you'll get it.

40
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:20,080
You might wonder what could be better than having peace and having had it drummed into you in endless prayers and services.

41
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,120
It's a good question, but you'll find out in a minute.

42
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:34,000
Because Pascal already, and being the genius that he is, sees that that's not really the right thing for the Judeo-Christians to want.

43
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:39,040
So he's the first existential thinker, and he has an entirely new and different view.

44
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,920
For him, the self is essentially both soul and body.

45
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:47,999
And the Hebrews already thought that, or acted that way.

46
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:57,360
They didn't make a big distinction where you had to decide whether you were serving God or whether you were winning battles, fighting idol worshipers or something.

47
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,440
That was all part of the day's work and in your life.

48
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:14,640
And certainly, when you get the fact that God becomes man, which is what Pascal is, it looks like having a body is just as important as having a soul.

49
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:20,360
I mean, if having a body wasn't an important thing, then why in the world would God take on a body?

50
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:29,239
And of course, if it wasn't important to have a soul, then God would just die, period, when his body died.

51
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:40,120
Surely there's something going on in the Hebrew Christian account of it, which seems to indicate that the body and the soul are equally essential.

52
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:41,800
Dante's interesting on this.

53
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,360
Dante understands that the.

54
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,879
See, they may get it wrong about peace, but they certainly get it right about their bodies and souls.

55
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,400
They never lose it.

56
00:07:51,719 --> 00:08:01,400
Even when they take over the Greeks, they take over Aristotle, who likes bodies, over Plato, who thinks we should die to our body.

57
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:16,040
In fact, Dante thinks bodies are so important that the people who die and go to hell and in the inferno and go to paradise and don't have any bodies couldn't really be there at all.

58
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:25,000
So they get loner bodies, which are sort of like bodies, until the day, until the final judgment when they'll get their real bodies back.

59
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:32,360
And only when they get their real bodies back will they really experience the pain of hell or the bliss of paradise.

60
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,000
You just can't be a full human being without your body.

61
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:42,040
But then, if these are contradictory impulses, and now that's something Dante had no clue about.

62
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,680
That's what I said Pascal thinks.

63
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:57,720
So he thinks that these two aspects are contradictory, the soul and the body, and says, what a monster then is man, what a novelty, what a chaos, what a contradiction.

64
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:04,639
And that's the new idea, that the self is a set of contradictory impulses.

65
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,240
The Greeks already knew that.

66
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:11,840
But those contradictory impulses that are equally essential, and you can't get rid of either one of them.

67
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,120
That's news.

68
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:18,800
What that means is that you're never going to get happy harmoniousness and peace.

69
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,040
That isn't what you could have, and it isn't what you should have, and you don't want it anyway.

70
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,400
There are better things.

71
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,560
So, what is the best thing?

72
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,920
Well, one funny way to put it, in your Pascal quotes, these quotes I'm quoting are there.

73
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:40,719
Pascal says that you should live wholly in a way stretched along this tension between these two aspects.

74
00:09:40,719 --> 00:09:49,680
He says, we do not display greatness by going to one extreme or the other, but in touching both at once and filling all the intervening space.

75
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:58,000
Be as embodied as you can, be as disembodied as you can, be as involved as you can, that's the body part.

76
00:09:57,999 --> 00:10:03,440
Contemplate truth in a disembodied way, as much as you can, that's the other part.

77
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,480
Get them together.

78
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:08,560
But you can't get them together in a peaceful way.

79
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,680
You'll always be under this kind of tension.

80
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,760
And so, the idea of this harmoniousness and peace, that's a Greek idea.

81
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:25,840
For Pascal, the most you can do is be constantly alive to what an incredibly wonderful and hard thing it is to be a human self.

82
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,600
And of course, you see that coming out in Kierkegaard, where anguish turns out to be a defining feature of the knight of faith.

83
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:32,560
He never gets over it.

84
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,919
You don't say to the knight of faith, well, grant him peace, let him sleep well tonight, and so forth.

85
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,839
He never has peace, and he never sleeps well, and that's just, but he's got something else better than peace.

86
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,200
He's got anguish and bliss, which go together.

87
00:10:47,479 --> 00:11:01,000
And that's so there you get, from Pascal's point of view, you can repress and deny part of yourself, or you can live in the tension.

88
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:15,560
If you try to repress and deny the way the Greeks did, and if you look at it from a Plato point of view, that you should be more, you should be, sort of, bring out the angel in you and repress the devil in you.

89
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:24,040
Pascal says man is neither simply angel nor simply brute, and the unfortunate thing is that he who would act the angel acts the brute.

90
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:31,719
So not only is it impossible to be one or the other, but it's even dangerous to try to be just one or the other.

91
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:32,760
He's very extreme.

92
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,879
It's brilliantly out on a new limb.

93
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,280
I don't know.

94
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:41,160
Anybody could see so many amazingly, radically new things.

95
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,639
And Dostoevsky is very influenced by Pascal.

96
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,120
I have not read anywhere that he read Pascal, but I know he must have.

97
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,759
Anyway, every Christian would.

98
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:57,879
So I could begin to ask you questions that you can keep in mind as you read the brothers.

99
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,680
Which brother Karamaza turns out acting the brute?

100
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,160
That is, not in the sense of bashing people around, but the bad guy.

101
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,719
Who turns out to be a bad guy because he wants to be so perfectly good?

102
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,680
Any brother come in there.

103
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,959
And so now let me see.

104
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:26,279
But if you try to live in this contradictory way, you oscillate between pride and despair, he thinks.

105
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:37,199
And Jesus is the extremist version of somebody who should oscillate between pride and despair, because he's, after all, God, and that's something to be pretty proud of.

106
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:41,839
But he's also meek and humble and washing the feet of Mary Magdalene and so forth.

107
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,640
He seems to be somehow and letting people, in effect, walk all over him if they want to.

108
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,639
That's this non, non-what, what's the word for it?

109
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,279
When you let people hurt you, but you don't hurt them back.

110
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,199
That's a Christian notion.

111
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,599
There's an obvious phrase for it.

112
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:01,759
Non-what?

113
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,120
Non-violence?

114
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,279
It's sort of, it's what?

115
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,999
It's turned the other cheek, but what is that?

116
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:15,759
And well, anyway, it's it's so Jesus is whatever this is, somebody who, and what are we supposed to think about that?

117
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:29,999
Well, somehow, Jesus, the God-man, lived at these extremes of misery and greatness, of what, and somehow he's able to do it without falling into pride or despair.

118
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:33,759
And what we're supposed to do, and here's where Pascal just cops out.

119
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:35,920
He doesn't have anything interesting to say.

120
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,999
He says, well, since Jesus did it, we should imitate Jesus so we can do it too.

121
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:43,599
But that doesn't help much.

122
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,400
I mean, we don't understand how he did it, what it was to do it, and how come we can do it.

123
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,840
After all, he was the God-man.

124
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,000
Pascal just hasn't got anything helpful to say.

125
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,360
He got as far as he got.

126
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,879
We're a contradiction.

127
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,599
We've got to live in anguish and bliss, and there's no way to get outside the contradiction.

128
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,519
You've got to be alive in it.

129
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,359
But that's not enough.

130
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,359
So, where do you go from there?

131
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,680
Well, I don't know that anybody said anything interesting about the self between Pascal and Dostoevsky, but I bet they did.

132
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,160
And somebody may send me an email from the podcast world, or you guys may come and tell me in office hours.

133
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:37,879
But as far as I know, the next move that sort of completes what Pascal did half of is Kierkegaard on this page, where he decides to tell you exactly what the self is and how it should be put together.

134
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:47,640
This page is from a book you'll see at the bottom of the page one, Kierkegaard's book, The Sickness Unto Death.

135
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:59,640
And the interesting thing is that, you know, I told you Kierkegaard writes almost all his books under other pseudonyms, like Fear and Trembling is from the point of view of Johannes de Salentio.

136
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:13,719
So, De Salentio, as I keep telling people in office hours when they come in, believing, I mean, DeSalentio says he loves God, that when he's contemplating God, it fills him with peace and happiness, and so forth and so forth.

137
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:16,360
And that's true, all right, but he's in despair.

138
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,640
De Salentio hasn't got faith, and he's no knight of faith.

139
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:28,359
Loving God is Platonic, it's in Dante, but it's not, it's not from Kierkegaard's point of view, it's not Christianity.

140
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,080
And so, don't get confused by that.

141
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:38,680
But Sickness Unto Death is one of the two books Kierkegaard wrote from the point of view of a Christian.

142
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:45,959
And he signed, he didn't sign it with his own name because he said it's so hard to be a Christian that he doesn't claim that he can do it.

143
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:57,160
The best he can do is love God and be blissful in his radiant stuff that resignation can do, that Johannes de Salentio can do.

144
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:04,160
But we're supposed to believe that the right answer, so to speak, of how to live is in sickness unto death.

145
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:08,880
The sickness unto death, the title, is the Bible name for despair.

146
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,719
And the book is all about kinds of despair.

147
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:33,920
And then there is in the middle of the book this very formal definition of the self, which is, as you'll see when we go through it, supposed to be a definition or a description or a formal something of what a self has to be and do in order to be out of despair, out of the sickness.

148
00:16:33,999 --> 00:16:38,320
And he wants to say that all of us are in despair.

149
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,799
We're all in the sickness unto death.

150
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,440
But I'm not sure do I want to start with that or with the self?

151
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,759
Well, having gotten into this in a different way than I intended, I'm going to go through with it.

152
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:56,640
It was something I had to talk about today.

153
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:12,079
So it would make it a lot more interesting, I guess, and maybe I should have always done it this way, to try to convince you first that you're all in despair so that you will read this passage with special attention because it's supposed to tell you how to get out of it.

154
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:26,000
And if you think you aren't in it, if you're having a good time and you're exercising your capacities and either satisfying your body or your mind or in unstable ways, maybe both on and off, then you're not going to be so impressed.

155
00:17:25,999 --> 00:17:32,640
So I better give you Kierkegaard's interesting, I think, maybe even convincing argument that you're all in despair.

156
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,199
And me.

157
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,959
There may be a few people here, I don't claim to be one, who aren't.

158
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:53,959
The only way to not be in despair, I'll just tell you in advance so that any of you who know that you satisfy these conditions can relax, the only way to be out of despair is to have been in despair, to recognize that you're in despair, and then have been saved from it.

159
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:58,199
Unless you've gone through all that, you're in despair right now.

160
00:17:58,199 --> 00:17:59,479
Now, how can that be?

161
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:01,240
Well, look on the page two.

162
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:06,599
I've decided that is to do the chart, not the chart, but what's below the chart.

163
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,359
Below the chart is the argument that you're all in despair.

164
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,799
So I'm going to read it to you.

165
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:20,680
The common view overlooks the fact that when compared with illness, despair differs dialectically from what one usually calls sickness.

166
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:25,079
Dialectically, I don't, I mean, Kierkegaard throws in the word dialectically a lot.

167
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,640
As far as I can see, you could just cross it out.

168
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,559
It doesn't do anything, is the argument.

169
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:31,160
It's a Hegel term.

170
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,039
And it has, I think you could almost say philosophically, but the best thing is just not to say anything there.

171
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:41,640
Despair differs from what one usually calls sickness because it's a sickness of the spirit.

172
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,199
And this aspect, dialectical, I'm going to skip it for now.

173
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:51,799
This aspect, properly understood, brings further thousands under the category of despair.

174
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:54,920
You are those further thousands and me.

175
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:07,160
If at any time a physician is convinced that so-and-so is in good health, and then later that person becomes ill, the physician may well be right about his having been well at the time, but he's now sick.

176
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,999
Not so with despair.

177
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:14,119
Once despair appears, what is apparent is that the person was in despair.

178
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,640
In fact, it's never possible.

179
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,239
Now, let's stop with that.

180
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:21,479
It's a very funny kind of disease.

181
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:31,160
It's a disease that has what Kierkegaard calls the dialectic of eternity, but it just, again, it's just eternity in it.

182
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:48,239
And that means that, remember, if you go living along in time like this, just moment by moment by moment, and then comes the defining moment, and you get a defining commitment, it affects your whole past as not having it, and your whole future is having it.

183
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:53,519
Well, despair has the same kind of eternal structure.

184
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,039
You're living along moment by moment, and then comes despair.

185
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:03,920
When you discover that you're in despair, it goes back and tells you you've been in despair all along and you always would be, will be.

186
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,599
Well, what could that be?

187
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,559
Well, that's a very strange claim.

188
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,680
Well, luckily, you see Rishima Monomur.

189
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,999
That helps a lot understanding.

190
00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:25,279
What does that woman realize, little French woman, when she looks into the mirror, remembers that if she loves the Japanese man, she has to forget the German and then her life will become meaningless.

191
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:32,719
But if she doesn't love the Japanese man, then she can never have fulfillment and intimacy, and she realizes she's trapped.

192
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:34,239
What's the trap?

193
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:38,559
She's got a kind of life that just doesn't work.

194
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:47,759
There is no way to do it, to keep the first love alive and in front of her and to have another love too.

195
00:20:49,199 --> 00:20:56,560
That's so impossible that it isn't even possible for the people who live in the world where impossibilities are possible.

196
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:04,879
But there are lots of different ways that people's lives may, in the end, turn out not to work.

197
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:09,120
I'll just give you one other from Kierkegaard's Either or Volume 1.

198
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:21,640
There he talks about some person who was somehow badly treated when they were a child, abused or beaten up by their siblings or abandoned by their parents or whatever.

199
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,759
And they've defined themselves as that unfortunate person.

200
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,279
And there's nothing they can do to fix it.

201
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:39,640
And what they need to do is go on and get over it, integrate it somehow, and give themselves a life.

202
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,999
But they don't want to get a new life.

203
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:47,640
They want to vindicate and get back what they feel they deserve from their childhood.

204
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,079
And they won't be happy unless they get it back.

205
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,519
But of course, it's impossible.

206
00:21:52,519 --> 00:22:00,119
As Kierkegaard would say, they want this impossible fixing up of the past, which they can't have.

207
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:05,640
And they don't want the openness to the future where they could still be happy, which they do have.

208
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,240
So their life is impossible.

209
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:08,599
And they're in despair.

210
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,959
But there are all kinds of ways of living.

211
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:23,879
And the general way of being in despair is to be in the contradiction, which in some way or another you are living in, and you don't realize it.

212
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:30,199
But now the question is: well, then why am I telling you that you're in despair now?

213
00:22:30,199 --> 00:22:31,799
Well, that's the interesting dismal.

214
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:36,039
Kierkegaard is so full of funny and wonderful ideas.

215
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:47,479
Despair is such that once you experience it, you see that the kind of life you are living, you can never be happy.

216
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,519
And that's half the story.

217
00:22:50,519 --> 00:23:17,599
But if it's really what you see is that your life isn't working like the Japanese woman, then you see that you never were happy, that you always were living in such a way that you could find out that the way you're living is a way that you can't live it securely.

218
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,080
And once you fall into despair, then you see that you were in despair all along.

219
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,640
That's what it is.

220
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,999
Let me try one more way to put it because you're not looking as convinced as I thought you should be.

221
00:23:27,999 --> 00:23:30,719
So let's say, I'll try this.

222
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:33,359
Distinguish despair from being sad.

223
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:41,120
Suppose something really sad happens, your dog dies or whatever, and you feel really sad about it for a while.

224
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,999
That doesn't mean that you were sad all your life.

225
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:46,080
Remember, that's the first sentence.

226
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,680
That would be like an illness.

227
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:54,640
If you discover you're sick, it doesn't mean you've been sick with that disease all your life.

228
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:04,239
If you discover that something about, you might even discover something about your life that makes you sad, namely that you, I don't know, are dyslexic or something.

229
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:07,279
But that might be too bad.

230
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,719
But that's not this kind of sadness.

231
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:13,999
Well, that might just make you sad for a while.

232
00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:23,839
But now, maybe something really awful could happen to you, that you've been training all your life to be a ballet dancer and now you've broken your ankle, you'll never be able to do it again.

233
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,120
That would make you miserable because of how much that was tied up in your life.

234
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,440
But that wouldn't mean that while you were a successful ballet dancer, you were miserable.

235
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,680
It would just mean that you had seen that for the rest of your life, you would never be happy again.

236
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,479
Yeah.

237
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:44,879
Well, you could say that, but it wouldn't be that, how can we put it?

238
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,920
It isn't, it isn't as if there's something about the way your way of life is impossible.

239
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:59,400
I mean, you could certainly say that you didn't realize something bad was going to happen, but it was sort of an accident that it happened.

240
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,360
That's why, and you're miserable from then on.

241
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:08,039
But if you realize that the kind of life you're living doesn't work, now comes the question.

242
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:13,160
You certainly realize that you're going to be in X, let's say, despair, from now on.

243
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:16,759
But if you realize that your life isn't working, what about your past?

244
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:19,079
Do you realize, what do you realize about your past?

245
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:20,680
And you were always in despair.

246
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:29,799
Because you always had set things up so that you could never really be happy, satisfied, and fulfilled the way you were living.

247
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:34,360
And that means, you see, there's nothing now, it's easy to draw the last conclusion with it.

248
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,080
That means what?

249
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,559
That we're all in despair right now.

250
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:43,799
Because when we were all, you may be lucky enough to get through life without realizing it.

251
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:53,640
But if you realize that your way of getting the factors and the self together, which we'll talk about next, is not working, then you realize it never did.

252
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:58,599
And you realize later that you were in despair right now, sitting here, only you didn't know it.

253
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,999
Now, you want to say something?

254
00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:15,799
Well, that anguish, no, the interesting thing about anguish is that it's also, I think, I have to think about it, I think it's also eternal, but it's eternal like the finding commitment is.

255
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,160
Not that you had it all along, but that it's who you are.

256
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,399
And when you didn't have it, you were lost and your life was empty.

257
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,199
And now you've got it, and your life is positive.

258
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:31,319
So here, anguish starts here, I think.

259
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:41,599
And anguish says you are in anguish from now on because you see the sword over the head of the beloved, and you see that you've got a higher authority in your life that can make you go against the ethical.

260
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:48,640
But you don't see that you always have a higher authority in your life that make you go against the ethical because you didn't.

261
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,400
You only got it here.

262
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,880
So you can't project the anguish back.

263
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:56,479
The answer is to sort of think about the phenomenon.

264
00:26:56,479 --> 00:27:04,559
And the only thing, the only experience that you can project back this way is despair, Kierkegaard thinks.

265
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,719
So let's read it now.

266
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:12,560
So once it happens, once despair appears, I'm in the middle of the paragraph.

267
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,880
What is apparent is that the person was in despair.

268
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:21,119
In fact, it's never possible at any time to decide anything about a person who was not saved through having been in despair.

269
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:29,039
That is, you can be saved if you're in despair and then get the right thing to get out of it, get a savior.

270
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:34,160
But only then, you can't just be saved before you ever get into it.

271
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:41,519
For when, whatever, for when whatever causes a person to despair occurs, it is immediately evident that he's been in despair his whole life.

272
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:48,400
When someone gets a fever, on the other hand, it cannot possibly be said that now it's evident that he's had a fever all his life.

273
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,880
That despair is a characteristic of the spirit.

274
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:57,519
It's related to the eternal and has something of the eternal in its dialectic, that is, in the way it works.

275
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:08,479
Okay, I was going to put that later, and we put it here now, because now we're going to find out both how it is at a very abstract level, we're all in despair.

276
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:14,160
You have to fill it in with your own story about what it is that makes your life not work.

277
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:23,080
But everybody's life isn't working for the reason that Pascal understands, that we are a contradiction and we've got to get it together.

278
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,959
And there's only one way to get it together, and most of us haven't done it.

279
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:30,440
But now we have to see how that works.

280
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,199
Yeah.

281
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,880
With what?

282
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:35,239
The moment you.

283
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:58,520
Well, when you realize that the way you've set up your life, you can never be happy in the future, and then you realize, and moreover, it follows, if it follows from the way your life is set up, that you can never be happy in the future, then it's always been like that, at least since you got old enough to have a way of life.

284
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:00,520
Think of the French woman again.

285
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:08,120
When she gives her sigh or moan, I forget the word, of utter what?

286
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,560
Utter misery?

287
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:26,760
I have to go back to the script, but she gives a something of something, the script says, which is clearly her expression of despair, as she realizes that her life, the way she set it up, she could never be happy.

288
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:34,440
She was lucky enough to, if the German had lived, she never would have realized that she was sort of skating on thin ice.

289
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:47,800
But the way she set up the fact that she's got a defining commitment, and that if that defining commitment dies, she can't deal with it without giving up meaning or intimacy the way she set it up.

290
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,239
Then she realizes that that's the way.

291
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:58,280
It's always been the way her life has been, that she can't have meaning and intimacy, or at least she's subject to this always possible disaster.

292
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,440
And that's her despair.

293
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:16,479
And the despair comes, that the experience comes at the moment where she actually sees the disaster and sees that it's not just bad luck or something she can fix or hope that it'll get better, that that's just the way her life has got to be given the way she, the kind of life she has.

294
00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:17,599
Does that help?

295
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,479
Okay.

296
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,440
Now, we're going to read this difficult thing.

297
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,440
I have to start now because I want to read it before you all go away so you can think about it.

298
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,640
Okay, so we're going to read the first paragraph.

299
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:35,120
And always keep the chart in mind, but I'll tell you when to look at it.

300
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:42,239
So we're going to understand the human being is spirit, but what is spirit?

301
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,920
Spirit is the self.

302
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,600
Then what is the self?

303
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:47,759
The self, this is a crucial sentence.

304
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:54,080
The self is a relation which relates to itself, or that in the relation which is its relating to itself.

305
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:57,440
The self is not a relation, but the relations relating to itself.

306
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,999
That's a fancy new idea.

307
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,519
And it became, it's now, I mean, all existentialists talk this way.

308
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:15,999
Heidegger starts his big book, Being in Time, that human, he called it Dasein, which is us, is defined as, what is it now?

309
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:24,479
We are a being who is defined by for whom our being is an issue for us.

310
00:31:24,479 --> 00:31:25,999
That's his way of putting it.

311
00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:38,640
But whatever, it's the idea is that you have to, in the way you behave, take a stand on what a human self is.

312
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,679
And that's already been in what I said.

313
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:47,199
I mean, the Greeks did it one way, and the Romans did it another way, and so forth.

314
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:57,560
But this very abstract thing, that human beings are defined by the way they understand what it is to be a human being.

315
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:00,440
That's what that complicated sentence says.

316
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,440
The self is not the relation.

317
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,959
to itself, but it's that the relation relates to itself.

318
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:07,159
That's the tricky part.

319
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:16,360
See, if you look at the picture now, it's a relation between, we'll read more in a minute, two sets of factors which are listed in those boxes.

320
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:24,039
But just being a relation between the two of them only gets you R1 in my drawing.

321
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:26,360
And that is, that's just the relation.

322
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:30,039
The relation relating itself to itself is R2.

323
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:31,079
We haven't got to that.

324
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:32,760
Don't think about that yet.

325
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,400
So we have to have the factors first.

326
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,519
Now we get the factors.

327
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:43,239
A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, the temporal and the eternal, the freedom and necessity.

328
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,920
In short, it's a synthesis.

329
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,959
The synthesis is a relation between two terms.

330
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:50,679
Looked at in this way, a human being is not yet a self.

331
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:52,599
That's a funny paragraph.

332
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:59,479
You think that last we just, you know, we've been just told what a self is, and it was a mouthful, but at least we heard it.

333
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:01,720
But no, no, that wasn't a self.

334
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,320
Why wasn't it a self?

335
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:08,279
Well, it's because the synthesis didn't take a stand on being a synthesis.

336
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,720
The self didn't relate itself to itself.

337
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,880
Now, and what does all that fancy talk mean?

338
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,360
Well, here we go again.

339
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:27,559
It's a synthesis of two sets of factors, and you should be very familiar with them by now: the finite, temporal, necessary.

340
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:29,079
We'll say more about them all.

341
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:32,120
The infinite, the eternal, and the possible.

342
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:38,800
But again, I'm not quite ready to tell you all about that, but what does it mean to say that it's a synthesis?

343
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,640
Well, that's very important.

344
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:45,519
I put on a chart body and soul in a ghostly sort of way with dentes.

345
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,040
Kierkegaard never says that we're a combination of body and soul.

346
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,520
And it's no accident.

347
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:59,840
He doesn't want to because he thinks that body and soul are a combination.

348
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,320
And I'm putting a big emphasis on that word.

349
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,200
A combination means you could take them apart.

350
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,839
And that's exactly what the Greeks thought they could do.

351
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:19,840
They could either die to their body or get rid of their superstition about souls because they were a combination of these two sets of factors.

352
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:24,240
But Kierkegaard says we're a synthesis of the two sets of factors.

353
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:29,600
That's his way of saying you've got to satisfy both of them.

354
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,119
You've got to live in such a way that you can't dump either.

355
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,999
I mean, it's just his way of saying that we're defined as a contradiction.

356
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,479
It's the Pascal point.

357
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:42,239
It's the Judeo-Christian point.

358
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,400
Our body is essential.

359
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,320
God sort of wouldn't have had a body if it weren't.

360
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,240
Our soul is essential.

361
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,800
Certainly we wouldn't be worrying about eternity and such if it weren't.

362
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,200
And we're both of them.

363
00:34:58,479 --> 00:35:04,800
If you're just a synthesis, then you haven't even seen the problem yet.

364
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,080
And that's what it is to be R1, to be a human being.

365
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,039
Being a human being isn't a self yet.

366
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:14,800
Being a human being is sort of a problem that isn't solved yet.

367
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,560
So let's go on.

368
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:22,040
In a relation between two things, the relation is the third term in the form of a negative unity.

369
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:24,999
Now, this is probably the hardest paragraph.

370
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:27,400
And it took me years to sort of crack it.

371
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:31,160
But once you understand this paragraph, then everything falls into place.

372
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:32,360
So try hard.

373
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:39,400
In a relation between two things, two sets of factors, the relation is a third term in the form of a negative unity.

374
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:44,119
And the two relate to the relation, and in the relation to that relation, I don't know what that means for it.

375
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:50,680
This is what it is from the point of view of a soul or soul and body to be in relation.

376
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:53,400
So you see, he does talk about soul and body.

377
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,999
I made it sound like he didn't.

378
00:35:54,999 --> 00:35:57,080
But he doesn't think they're factors.

379
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:00,679
He thinks, but I see this is a really tricky paragraph.

380
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:04,360
What this paragraph is about is the Greeks.

381
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:11,320
And what it says is that there's a way of relating to yourself in a negative way.

382
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,760
You can unify yourself by getting rid of half of yourself.

383
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:24,359
It's a very abstract and condensed way of saying this long thing I said at the beginning about what it is to have a self.

384
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:38,920
And one of the ways to try to have a self doesn't work is to try to get rid of one of the back sets of factors, claiming it's not the essential one.

385
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,600
You're only essentially a body, or you're only essentially a soul.

386
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:44,920
And that would be a negative unity.

387
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:48,840
That doesn't work.

388
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,080
And we'll hear more about that in a minute.

389
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:58,280
And then, if, on the other hand, the relation relates itself to itself, then this relation is the positive third, and this is the self.

390
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:07,599
Okay, that means, if you go over here, if the factors are related to each other just by being combined, you haven't got a self.

391
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,440
You haven't even got spirit and passion.

392
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:18,880
You're just living along like an organ, like an animal or something, or child.

393
00:37:20,959 --> 00:37:26,479
If you try to get the self together with all your might, that's R2.

394
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,600
And what happens in R2 is that you can't do it.

395
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:34,880
You can't alone fix the contradiction.

396
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,079
Now, Kierkegaard is going to try to go beyond Pascal.

397
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,679
Pascal got that far.

398
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:51,200
You sort of are kind of crucified on the extremes of pride and humility and so forth, but he doesn't explain how you can get them together.

399
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:56,240
So now comes the very next line.

400
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:05,680
Such a relation which relates itself to itself, and now it is a self, must either have established itself or been established by something else.

401
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,959
Something else?

402
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:09,200
I was looking for that phrase.

403
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:09,920
Okay.

404
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,719
Now, how do I want to put this?

405
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,759
Okay, well, it turns out you can't do R2.

406
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,840
We have to explain more about that in a minute.

407
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,760
But what is R3?

408
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,999
Well, that's, now let's go back here.

409
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:29,759
The self relating to itself by relating to something else.

410
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,320
You see, right?

411
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,479
That's the third little paragraph.

412
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:37,920
Do you recognize that that is a very abstract form of something that you've been hearing about a lot?

413
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,440
I hope you do.

414
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,440
How is the self relates to itself by relating to something else?

415
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,120
Or in a different translation, by relating to another, which is the same.

416
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:48,839
What?

417
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,559
Yes, yes, hooray, good.

418
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,679
Several people said it.

419
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:57,959
Last time I gave this, nobody said it, and I almost went home in despair.

420
00:38:57,959 --> 00:39:01,079
But so there you have it.

421
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:15,319
The idea is that the only way to get the two factors together in a harmonious, well, harmonious isn't the right thing, get them together in a way where they reinforce each other.

422
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:22,920
The more of one, the more of the other, instead of contradicting each other, is to get a defining relation.

423
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:27,239
And I will explain that in a minute, but let's finish reading this.

424
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:32,920
Skip all the stuff now that goes on in between and go to the end of that big paragraph.

425
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:41,880
The imbalance in despair is not simply an imbalance, but an imbalance in a relation that relates itself to itself and which is constituted by another.

426
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,959
Skip that for a while.

427
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,639
That's going to come out back later.

428
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:46,359
That's hard.

429
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,800
Let's go down to the next.

430
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:54,120
This then is the formula which describes the state of the self when despair is completely eradicated.

431
00:39:54,119 --> 00:40:01,880
In relating to itself and in wanting to be itself, the self is grounded transparently in the power that constituted it.

432
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,800
That is a mouthful.

433
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:20,680
And if you read it sort of through kind of orthodox Christian eyes, it looks like he's saying, well, the self has to get outside of itself and somehow be grounded in God because there's this power that established it.

434
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:28,599
But if you read it very carefully, you notice that the power isn't capitalized, that it's a very general notion.

435
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:34,080
I mean, it could be Jesus for reasons that we get mentioned every once in a while.

436
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:50,400
It can't be God the Father, because Kierkegaard thinks that once Jesus has come along and says he's God, and he is, I mean, that's always inside Christianity we're talking, then you get your relation to God by having an unconditional commitment to Jesus.

437
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,280
You've got no relation to God the Father at all.

438
00:40:53,280 --> 00:41:01,840
There isn't even any God the Father, it looks like what used to be God the Father is now understood to be simply that all things are possible.

439
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,640
You don't love and pray to that things are possible.

440
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:09,760
You love and pray to Jesus, who's a finite, embodied God.

441
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,160
And that's the power that constituted it.

442
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:15,679
But it needn't be Jesus.

443
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:19,360
I mean, then it would be capital P, or it could be just the God-man.

444
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,720
You could write God-Man.

445
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,920
It could be, of course, we could keep doing this, Dante's relation to Beatrice.

446
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,519
Beatrice posited or established Dante.

447
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:31,360
Now, how could that be?

448
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:39,279
Well, Dante became Dante, the greatest love poet of all times, let's suppose.

449
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:46,080
He thought he was, who wrote the best love poem about his lady that anybody ever wrote.

450
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:47,440
Beatrice did that.

451
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,280
I mean, she made it possible.

452
00:41:49,280 --> 00:42:01,200
She made it, she drew out of Dante an infinite passion, which defined him as the poet of the lady Beatrice.

453
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,440
In that sense, she really produced Dante.

454
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,440
That's the first half of this.

455
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,519
That is the sense in which the self is grounded transparently now in the power that constituted it.

456
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:21,079
Well, Dante is grounded in Beatrice, and she made him Dante, gave him the definition.

457
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:33,159
He was already running around, and everybody was calling him Dante, but he didn't have an individual until he got an unconditional commitment, and that defined him as the poet, lover of Beatrice.

458
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:34,440
So she did that.

459
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,400
Now, what is it to be transparently ground?

460
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:48,200
Well, that's Kierkegaard jargon for in everything you do in your life that matters, you reflect, you express this relationship.

461
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:56,440
So, whatever Dante did, he did it if it was worth doing and important to him, and was the lover of Beatrice.

462
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:12,759
So, that whenever you get your power that establishes you, that is, draws out of you an unconditional commitment that gives you a definition, you will then express it in everything meaningful you do.

463
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:17,479
I don't think you wash your hands, I don't think Dante washed his hands as the lover of Beatrice.

464
00:43:17,479 --> 00:43:20,840
I don't think and brushed his teeth if he could do that.

465
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:33,720
But anything that anybody does that matters, they do as in a way that expresses that this commitment is defining them.

466
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:49,160
So, now that gives you that whole story, but it doesn't have, I haven't ever really explained very clearly, and I won't really be able to fully, but if you look at the top italics, we can now explain more of the diagram, anyway.

467
00:43:49,479 --> 00:43:50,840
See where we are?

468
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:55,559
Despair is a sickness of the spirit, of the self, and so it can have three forms.

469
00:43:55,559 --> 00:43:58,440
That's where you've got R1, R2, and R3.

470
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:03,040
You're unconscious in despair of having a self.

471
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:07,360
That is, you're in despair, but you don't know you're in despair, and you don't know you've got a self.

472
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:14,240
And you aren't even in despair, really, because you haven't got any of this feeling of eternity, your life doesn't work.

473
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,240
You keep yourself in a constant state of distraction.

474
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,040
Pascal's word for it is diversion.

475
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,799
Pascal, I think I read it when I read these quotes.

476
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,279
You can do it by playing tennis, or you can do it by gambling.

477
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:36,959
He has a list, or dancing, or staying alone in your room and doing algebra, like he thinks Descartes was doing, or whatever.

478
00:44:36,959 --> 00:44:43,440
You can, and you can do it also by getting drunk, presumably, and running around with wild women, whatever.

479
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:49,360
And I'm putting some of these in there because I want you to keep your eyes open.

480
00:44:49,360 --> 00:45:05,280
Which karamatsa is going to be in that state, the state that is in the state of spiritlessness, where he hasn't even understood that he's got a self and a problem.

481
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,280
Okay, that's the first one.

482
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:16,479
That's the despair of having a despair of having a self, being unconscious of the despair of having a self.

483
00:45:16,479 --> 00:45:21,199
Then there is not wanting in despair to be oneself.

484
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,919
These are all so cryptic, I have to unravel them.

485
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,800
What would it be to, in despair, not want to be oneself?

486
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:29,840
Yeah.

487
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,679
Are you even fair?

488
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:35,679
Oh, well, we've talked about it, you know.

489
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:40,080
I mean, so this person's life is already not working.

490
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,920
They're just not aware it's not working.

491
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:55,399
They manage to keep themselves sufficiently busy in the stock market and drunk and running around with ladies that they haven't, they're doing it on purpose not to notice that their life isn't working.

492
00:45:55,639 --> 00:45:56,839
And that's possible.

493
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,360
Lots of people do that.

494
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:03,080
And that would be to be in despair and not notice they're in despair.

495
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:06,040
How do we know they're in despair if they don't notice it?

496
00:46:06,039 --> 00:46:07,559
It's the same story we told.

497
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:08,279
You know.

498
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,440
Yeah, I could see you know.

499
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,720
Somebody knows.

500
00:46:12,679 --> 00:46:17,320
So how do we know that everybody's in despair who isn't out of despair?

501
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:18,280
Yeah.

502
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,519
That's half of it.

503
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:22,280
But I was going to go with the other half.

504
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:28,760
We know that once they realize they're in despair, they will realize they always were.

505
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:37,159
And since they haven't been saved, they will someday realize they're in despair, or maybe they won't.

506
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:39,159
They might live without noticing.

507
00:46:39,159 --> 00:46:42,599
But if they did, so we're talking about this Karamatsov.

508
00:46:42,599 --> 00:47:00,599
If this Karamatsov ever gets unmuddled enough to be able to realize what state he's in, he'll not only realize that he's in an eternal mess, but that he's been an eternal mess forever.

509
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:02,999
Okay, yeah, your hand is up.

510
00:47:02,999 --> 00:47:04,039
How does that work?

511
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,719
How can you go about getting saved from despair?

512
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:08,600
Aha.

513
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:12,680
Well, you need help from outside.

514
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:14,120
You need a savior.

515
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:26,999
The savior, in Dante's case, was Beatrice, who was so attractive, so beautiful, had such beautiful legs and smile and eyes and everything that he became the devoted his life to her.

516
00:47:26,999 --> 00:47:36,479
I mean, it might be some job that is so attractive, might be being a teacher is so attractive that you devote your whole life to it.

517
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:39,679
Something comes along and is your calling.

518
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,360
So how do you get out of despair?

519
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,880
You answer your calling, so to speak.

520
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,760
You can always refuse to answer your calling because of course once you do, it's all risky.

521
00:47:51,999 --> 00:47:53,679
Okay, yes, Beatrice.

522
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:54,640
A what?

523
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:55,360
A cause.

524
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:55,920
Sure it can.

525
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,040
Yeah, why not?

526
00:47:57,999 --> 00:48:05,919
Anything finite and temporal and therefore risky is a possible object of a defining commitment.

527
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:12,400
That is, Martin Luther King is an interesting case which keeps coming up.

528
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:25,679
If you say that Martin Luther King thinks of himself and his cause as justice for the black people somewhere, sometime, the sooner the better or something, that's not enough because it's not really vulnerable.

529
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:28,959
He can live and die and he will have succeeded in doing his part.

530
00:48:28,959 --> 00:48:39,120
He has to think of it as justice right now for my people in the South, in the United States, in the 19 whatevers.

531
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,359
And then that tells him, and there's the test.

532
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,959
It tells him every day, finitely and temporally, what to do.

533
00:48:46,959 --> 00:48:52,959
When he gets up in the morning, he knows what matters, namely organizing marches, presumably most of the time.

534
00:48:52,959 --> 00:48:59,599
But the point is, it's got to be something that tells you moment to moment what to do.

535
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,440
I'll tell you a whole story that will answer Beatrice's question.

536
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,920
I wasn't going to, but I will.

537
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,120
Go ahead.

538
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:08,399
I'll tell you in a minute.

539
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,239
Your defining commitment is impossible.

540
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,719
Ah, well, then you have to have faith, and then you will discover that you'll have it anyway.

541
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,559
I mean, that's we're back to the new, you'll always have Isaac.

542
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:21,799
If you're willing to suffer the anguish, you'll always get the bliss.

543
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:26,040
And the answer is grief and whole stuff to another.

544
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:27,799
Go ahead, yeah?

545
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:34,360
So you're being yourself, or no, no, you will go through anguish, not despair.

546
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:37,959
I mean, you could be in despair, but that would mean that you would have sort of lost it.

547
00:49:37,959 --> 00:49:41,160
I mean, that is repudiated and forgotten what you got.

548
00:49:41,159 --> 00:49:44,440
But if you've got a defining commitment, you never lose it.

549
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:49,080
It becomes part of you out of which you see the world, and you get another one.

550
00:49:49,079 --> 00:50:01,799
You always will have a new Isaac because even though it seems impossible, you can be able to be defined in such a way that you can keep your definition and get a new definition.

551
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:05,240
This is all the story of Hiroshima and the Japanese man.

552
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:08,920
Oh, no, if they stop with resignation, it's still despair.

553
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:12,199
Because you, I guess I haven't made it clear.

554
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:17,160
The only way, I see that there's a basic thing I haven't said, but I was going to get there.

555
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:34,760
The only way to be out of despair is to get the factors together, keep the picture in front of you, in such a way that the more finite, the more infinite in your life, the more temporal, the more eternal in your life, the more things are fixed and necessary, like a definition, the more they are possible and open.

556
00:50:35,479 --> 00:50:37,799
That's the only way to get out of despair.

557
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,159
That's the first thing to say.

558
00:50:39,159 --> 00:50:44,279
And the only way to do that, what I just said, is to relate to something outside the self.

559
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,239
And how relate?

560
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:48,280
Well, he doesn't say it, but it's with unconditional commitment.

561
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,560
I write it there.

562
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:54,039
Now, I'll tell you the story, the story for Beatrice later, but I will.

563
00:50:54,039 --> 00:50:56,839
But right now, I want to say, and how does that happen?

564
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,039
Well, that's very important.

565
00:50:58,039 --> 00:51:01,320
And that's what you're sort of seeing, I haven't said.

566
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:06,959
How does a defining commitment get the factors together in this positive way?

567
00:51:06,959 --> 00:51:08,880
That's what you need to know, right?

568
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:14,240
Because then you'll know how to be out of despair if you've got these factors together in a permanent, positive way.

569
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,440
Well, it follows.

570
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,360
That's the brilliance of Kierkegaard.

571
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:31,199
It just falls out, so to speak, of the definition of what it is, our description, of what it is to have an unconditional commitment, that it is finite and infinite, temporal and eternal, necessary, and possible.

572
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,400
Let's go through it.

573
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,360
The easiest one is the temporal and eternal.

574
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:37,760
Where did, by the way, I should have read that.

575
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,760
Didn't I ever read?

576
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:42,799
Yeah, a human being is a synthesis of those things.

577
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:48,880
I just, okay, so now, a defining commitment, let's start with temporal and eternal, because that's the easiest.

578
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,640
How is it temporal and eternal?

579
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:58,720
Well, it's going along in time, and it stays in time, but when you get to defining commitment, it is forever.

580
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:04,799
To talk like Dostoevsky, he's got this good way of, instead of talking about the eternal, to talk about forever.

581
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:11,360
But anyway, you can get in time a forever relation.

582
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:15,600
I will read it because I wrote it the way I wanted to write it.

583
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:20,800
Here's my section: how the factors reinforce each other.

584
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:28,640
Oh, I want the quote from another book of Kierkegaard's: Only in time do I become eternal.

585
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:30,880
You're prepared for that now.

586
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:39,360
That is, it's a special kind of eternal, not the Plato kind where you contemplate something outside of time, outside of involvement, outside of the body.

587
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:52,440
It's by being completely involved bodily and mentally with another person or in a cause that you become get and time becomes crucial for you and eternal.

588
00:52:52,679 --> 00:52:55,160
So the more time, the more eternal, so to speak.

589
00:52:55,159 --> 00:52:59,720
Now, to explain the finite and infinite is harder because I haven't prepared you for it.

590
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:04,760
But the sense in which a defining commitment is finite is easy.

591
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,999
It's an unconditional, you love something finite.

592
00:53:08,999 --> 00:53:10,839
That's what I said to Beatrice now.

593
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,039
That's the vulnerable part.

594
00:53:12,039 --> 00:53:15,640
That's why you can't love yourself and you can't love the ethical.

595
00:53:15,639 --> 00:53:16,999
Those aren't finite.

596
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:18,999
And now what is it?

597
00:53:18,999 --> 00:53:20,759
How do you get the infinite in there?

598
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:28,680
Well, he's got a very, just as he redefines the eternal in order to fit them together, but it's not a trick, it's an experience.

599
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:33,080
So there's an experience of the infinite, which is the world.

600
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:35,240
Now, how is the world infinite?

601
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:49,479
Well, when you've got a defining relation, everything that you come across that matters is constituted by or gets its meaning from the defining relation.

602
00:53:49,800 --> 00:54:02,440
And not only everything actual, but everything possible, that is, everything you could ever come across that mattered, would get its meaning and significance for you from the relation.

603
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,799
Well, that's a different thing.

604
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,320
That's a new dimension.

605
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:09,959
That everything that you could ever conceivably come across would have this meaning.

606
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:13,160
That's because it's part of the way your world is.

607
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:16,839
It's not just another fact.

608
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,840
Let me see how I wrote it here.

609
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:32,440
It gives, yeah, an infinite passion for something finite gives you your world and makes you able in all experience to distinguish what is significant and insignificant or you.

610
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:45,519
So there you get the more finite, that is the more particular and vulnerable and present the person or cause is, the more infinite, namely, the more it defines the limits of your world.

611
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:49,999
It tells you what can enter your world and under what conditions, so to speak.

612
00:54:49,999 --> 00:54:52,080
Now, the next one is easy again.

613
00:54:52,559 --> 00:55:02,400
And since the commitment defines you, it's like it's got a kind of necessity, like triangles have 180 degrees.

614
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:09,839
I mean, it's if Dante is the lover of Beatrice, then that's a necessary fact about Dante.

615
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:21,920
And everything that follows from that fact, like having 180 degrees follows from being a three-sided closed figure, will be necessary about Dante.

616
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:24,559
That, well, let's not try to list them.

617
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,240
I'm sure there are lots of things.

618
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:31,999
Anyway, now, oh, yeah, but free.

619
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:33,919
What about this freedom and possibility?

620
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,759
How does it look on the chart?

621
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:36,320
I gave you.

622
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,079
Let me just look at it.

623
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,279
What's it called?

624
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,719
Okay, there's necessity and there's possibility or freedom.

625
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,240
That is, and that's easy.

626
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:51,120
You're free, one, to give up your defining relation and betray it.

627
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:58,880
That's what Holly Martin does, if we think he has a defining relation to his friend Harry Lyme.

628
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,239
You can eternalize it in a bad sense.

629
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,039
Let's call it, idealize it, and become a knight of resignation.

630
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:07,520
That's what the French woman does.

631
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:12,719
You can express it in everything you do.

632
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,320
That's what you're supposed to do.

633
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,880
And that's, and you're free to have those choices.

634
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:26,760
So it's always, just because it's your definition, it makes it necessary about you doesn't take away your freedom the way triangles are not free to be, I don't know, anything else.

635
00:56:26,999 --> 00:56:30,760
You're a human being, you have a definition, and you're free to deal with it.

636
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:38,920
And moreover, you have to be free to take a new way of dealing with things all the time.

637
00:56:39,559 --> 00:56:44,360
Martin Luther King is free to call off his peace marches or to do them.

638
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:49,560
He's free to do them with white kids from the north or not and so forth.

639
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:52,520
And each time you have to make a decision and you're free.

640
00:56:52,519 --> 00:56:53,400
So there you get it.

641
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:55,719
The more necessity, the more freedom.

642
00:56:56,679 --> 00:57:02,999
So now we see that if you have a defining commitment, sort of voila, it all falls out.

643
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:09,959
What was a contradictory self becomes harmonious as an understatement?

644
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:15,959
A self in which the factors reinforce each other, where you could say of each the more this, the more that.

645
00:57:15,959 --> 00:57:22,040
And so you are out of despair and, so to speak, always out of despair.

646
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:30,999
Of course, you could be in grief, and you could get stuck in a defining commitment with resignation.

647
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:37,080
So I should say if you have a defining commitment in faith, you're out of despair.

648
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,920
You have to be a knight of faith, obviously.

649
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:39,880
Put that in.

650
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:40,360
Yeah.

651
00:57:40,679 --> 00:57:41,959
Okay, the three forms.

652
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:43,959
One is not knowing you're in despair.

653
00:57:43,959 --> 00:57:48,680
That just sort of keeping yourself drunk or being an innocent child.

654
00:57:48,679 --> 00:57:51,320
Those are both forms of spiritlessness.

655
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:57,880
Then there is, and I'm not going to say enough much about this till we get to the brothers, because it goes into it so completely.

656
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:01,399
That is trying to get rid of one half of yourself or the other.

657
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,200
I wasn't clear about that at all.

658
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:08,640
And not being able to do it, of course, because you're a synthesis, not a combination.

659
00:58:08,959 --> 00:58:22,320
So you beat your head against the wall, trying to get rid of your sensuality, for instance, so you can be pure intellect, or trying to get to be pure sensuality, and it doesn't work.

660
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:28,080
Then the third one, I forget how they're listed here, because I don't think I even mentioned the third.

661
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:32,640
Okay, not what I've done, inauthentic despair, the drunken one.

662
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:38,800
Not wanting in despair to be oneself, that's how to get rid of, trying to get rid of half.

663
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,679
Then there is wanting in despair to be oneself.

664
00:58:41,679 --> 00:58:42,880
I didn't explain that one.

665
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,080
What would it be?

666
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:50,959
It would be not trying to get rid of half, but trying to keep both halves and get them together without being related to another.

667
00:58:51,280 --> 00:59:03,520
If you don't, trying to be a self on your own willpower without a defining commitment is another and most interesting, and for Dostoevsky, the most interesting form of despair.

668
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:07,280
And there's a brother who's a perfect example of it.

669
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,319
Okay, now I think I did that.

670
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,959
Now I'm going to come back with a crazy example.

671
00:59:12,959 --> 00:59:22,239
I don't know whether you're going to consider that it shows that all of Kierkegaard is really like a joke, or whether it's going to show you that defining commitments come in very many different forms.

672
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,479
It's a true story, but I saw a hand up, didn't I?

673
00:59:24,479 --> 00:59:26,160
And ignored somebody.

674
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:27,760
Where did I see that?

675
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:28,800
Didn't I ignore somebody?

676
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:29,999
Yes.

677
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:31,839
Ah, well, it depends.

678
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,280
I mean, it's a good question.

679
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:46,640
If you're doing it in a way that is universal, like being for the equality for the black people or for all ethnic minorities or something, that's ethical, but it's not vulnerable.

680
00:59:47,159 --> 01:00:04,280
And if it's, I'm going to save these people here now in Georgia or into the South right now, or I consider my life a failure, that's not ethical because there's no universal principle, save the black people in the South right now.

681
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:05,880
That's why they're different.

682
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,600
Okay, okay, now here's an amazing story.

683
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,840
A true story, it's hard to believe.

684
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:23,079
And I know the person well who about it is a fellow graduate student of mine long ago was, wrote a book which was a bestseller.

685
01:00:23,079 --> 01:00:25,639
You can still find it in Moe's, I bet.

686
01:00:25,639 --> 01:00:27,880
It's called An Unknown Woman.

687
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:31,160
And it's about her life and her despair.

688
01:00:31,159 --> 01:00:36,200
That is, she was a mess, and her relationships were all a mess.

689
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:41,880
And she finally decided she couldn't live that way anymore.

690
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:44,280
She had to go and sort it out.

691
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:55,080
So she got a dog to protect her and went out to Nantucket, this lonely island, in the winter when nobody was around to just think through what she was up to.

692
01:00:55,079 --> 01:01:01,080
And after she thought it all through, she really reached the bottom because she was in despair.

693
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:06,119
She decided there was no way that her life would ever be anything but a mess.

694
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:07,559
She was going to commit suicide.

695
01:01:08,519 --> 01:01:11,559
She thought that was a, you know, was worth the trip, so to speak.

696
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:17,320
She saw the way she had to do it, what she had to do.

697
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:23,479
And then, when she got ready to commit suicide, she thought, but who will take care of the dog?

698
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,760
And the dog incidentally was named Logos.

699
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,359
That's the Godman.

700
01:01:28,679 --> 01:01:29,559
Independently.

701
01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:30,519
Don't ask me why.

702
01:01:30,519 --> 01:01:32,640
I mean, just the strangest coincidence.

703
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:36,239
So there was, she couldn't kill herself because of Logos.

704
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:41,199
And she had, it turns out, defining commitment to the dog.

705
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,599
It didn't turn out you couldn't see Yetix defining.

706
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,840
She just wondered who was going to feed the dog.

707
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:53,919
But because, and so the dog prevented her from committing suicide, she came back, she got her life together around the dog.

708
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,040
How could you do that?

709
01:01:55,039 --> 01:02:06,640
She became a vegetarian, an anti-vivisectionist, the kind of person who sort of attacks people who wear furs and belts and shoes and whatever.

710
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:07,440
Everything.

711
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:14,959
And she built her life around causes, all of whom were related to the dog.

712
01:02:14,959 --> 01:02:16,639
And that was what the book was about.

713
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:20,239
She didn't know any Kierkegaard, but it's a neat example.

714
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:31,440
She found another, an other, and not a human being, she wasn't good with human beings, that made, that gave her life a central kind of meaning.

715
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:37,120
The next part is really sort of sad and pathetic because the dog died.

716
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:40,399
And she did not make it into being a knight of faith.

717
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:48,399
She wrote a second book about how upset she was that the dog died, and she sued the veterinarian for malpractice.

718
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,240
And the book was all about that.

719
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,400
And that was a sort of an aberrant form.

720
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:53,440
Nobody bought that book.

721
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,840
Did not sell millions of copies.

722
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:05,440
But anyway, if you weren't busy reading Dostoevsky, I would tell you, go read this book, An Unknown Woman.

723
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,239
It's very well written and it's quite remarkable.

724
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:09,999
Okay, now we've got five more minutes.

725
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,759
We can't just throw them away.

726
01:03:11,759 --> 01:03:13,280
What should we do with them?

727
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,440
Let me see, because there's so many things I've jumped over.

728
01:03:17,879 --> 01:03:26,360
But let's go back and look at the self, we've got the chart, we've got everything that's really important.

729
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,280
So maybe I should let you guys ask questions.

730
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,079
Ah, good.

731
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:29,639
Question.

732
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:30,919
Yep.

733
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:49,239
No, it's the other finite object, be it Beatrice or the dog, that draws out of you unconditional commitment and thereby produces you as the kind of person, as the individual, talk like that you become.

734
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:53,799
And now here's what I'll talk about, unless somebody has another question.

735
01:03:54,120 --> 01:04:04,919
It's very interesting to ask the question: are people from other cultures, Buddhists say, all in despair?

736
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:11,079
And it's not clear what Kierkegaard thinks about it, but it's clear what I think about it, so I'll tell you.

737
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:14,440
I think Kierkegaard, Shatyrka got this far.

738
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:18,440
He said this whole story about the self is dogmatic.

739
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,039
That's a technical term.

740
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:23,079
That means it's based on the revelation in the Bible.

741
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:42,199
It doesn't claim to be able to argue by rational means that should convince everybody that we're a set of factors, that human beings are all, every human being, everywhere, forever, has been a set of factors which are contradictory but can be gotten together by unconditional commitments.

742
01:04:43,799 --> 01:04:55,479
It says that, the way I want to read it, any human being raised in the Christian, the Judeo-Christian West, and maybe Muslims come under that too, I just don't know enough about it.

743
01:04:55,479 --> 01:04:57,240
But Buddhists don't.

744
01:04:57,879 --> 01:05:01,719
Because how did we get to be this kind of self?

745
01:05:01,759 --> 01:05:05,919
I mean, the Greeks weren't the kind of self that had to have the two factors together.

746
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,320
I don't even know if the Greeks were in despair.

747
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,719
I don't think Kierkegaard ever says they were.

748
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:20,799
They had their thing, they had a harmonious life based on negating half of themselves because the two halves weren't essential.

749
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:22,479
How did they get to be essential?

750
01:05:22,479 --> 01:05:24,159
Well, now this is sort of weird.

751
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:33,759
Maybe it's, I mean, my story is, Kierkegaard is saying that it's because of the revelation they became essential.

752
01:05:34,479 --> 01:05:35,280
It's dogmatic.

753
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,799
But what does that mean?

754
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:45,839
That means that there was this guy, Jesus, who claimed to be the God-man, and people believed he was the God-man.

755
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:47,519
And I'm not saying whether he was or wasn't.

756
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:49,199
That depends on what you believe.

757
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:59,360
But enough people believed he was that they had an infinite passion for him, and that that took over the West.

758
01:05:59,759 --> 01:06:02,400
All the Romans finally became Christians and so forth.

759
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:10,639
It took a long time for them to get the Greek out of it, though the Middle Ages were still in the dark ages as far as getting Christianity right.

760
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:14,400
But finally, Pascal and Kierkegaard came along and sort it out.

761
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,559
Now, what really happened?

762
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:22,159
What really happened is that one of two things, or both.

763
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:25,360
Jesus, Kierkegaard says, is the paradigm.

764
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:28,320
That means the most exemplary case.

765
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:34,400
And he brings in the possibility of unconditional commitment.

766
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:45,519
And then it turns out that if you have unconditional commitment, you have a new kind of anguish and a new kind of bliss and a new kind of an aliveness, which spreads sort of like a disease.

767
01:06:45,519 --> 01:06:48,759
And it is sort of like a disease through all of Christendom.

768
01:06:48,759 --> 01:06:53,239
It's like a disease in that Christianity is the sickness for which it is the cure.

769
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:58,519
That means, if you're done, sickness unto death, Christianity produces this despair.

770
01:06:58,519 --> 01:07:00,919
The Greeks and the Buddhists don't have it.

771
01:07:00,919 --> 01:07:16,199
It produces it by giving people the possibility of a higher, Kierkegaard would say, form of life than they had before, and a higher kind of bliss than they had in any other culture or any other religion.

772
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:34,999
And anybody raised in this culture, it isn't in our DNA, anybody raised in our culture with our language, with our practices, with our books and movies and millions of paintings of the biblical stories and so forth, can't help but have this kind of self.

773
01:07:35,479 --> 01:07:44,759
And once you've got this kind of self, you're going to be in the sickness, namely, of despair, unless you get a defining commitment.

774
01:07:44,759 --> 01:07:55,400
And what sort of flinches it is, I mean, what Jesus showed was that if you do get a defining commitment, then you get this higher kind of life.

775
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:56,839
And then you get addicted to it.

776
01:07:56,839 --> 01:07:58,440
I mean, the culture got addicted to it.

777
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:09,639
I mean, who wouldn't want to live in bliss and anguish and get the most finite and the most infinite and the most all the goodies?

778
01:08:09,639 --> 01:08:13,639
So more and more people come to do it.

779
01:08:13,639 --> 01:08:18,999
Now, let me say, just because I've got still four more minutes, there's two ways that Jesus could have done it.

780
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,240
And I don't know which it is, and it's hard to see that it could be, it could sort of be both.

781
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:25,919
I mean, is Jesus the paradigm?

782
01:08:25,919 --> 01:08:32,159
Because he tells the disciples that they should have a defining relation to him.

783
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:34,639
That would be an interesting new idea.

784
01:08:34,639 --> 01:08:39,599
He says that they can worship him as if he were God.

785
01:08:39,599 --> 01:08:47,759
And that means that you could have this absolute unconditional, infinite passion for a finite being.

786
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:56,879
And he tells them that, but does he demonstrate what it is to have an infinite passion?

787
01:08:56,879 --> 01:09:02,879
Well, he says that he things like, you know, it's the high, that he is ready to die for his friend.

788
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:07,519
And it doesn't say for all his friends or any old friend.

789
01:09:07,519 --> 01:09:20,719
I mean, if you read that, that the friend is a defining commitment, like Augustine and his friends, then Jesus not only asks people to have a defining commitment to him, but he shows what it's like to have a commitment to them or to one of them.

790
01:09:20,879 --> 01:09:23,679
It's not very, it's all pretty murky in the past.

791
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:37,039
The other thing he could do, which really uses or sort of interests me more, is I used to say, well, if he's really the paradigm, he ought to have an unconditional commitment for some kind of cause or for one person.

792
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:47,280
And I don't think you could build all that on just something like something, anybody know the Bible well enough, something, something who lays down his life for his friend.

793
01:09:47,519 --> 01:09:50,559
That doesn't seem like an unconditional commitment to me.

794
01:09:50,559 --> 01:09:54,159
So I said, well, maybe Jesus is a freedom fighter.

795
01:09:54,160 --> 01:10:01,360
Maybe he's fighting on the side of the Israelis against the Romans, that that's his cause, that he's risking his life for it.

796
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:04,799
And everybody sort of laughed at me, and I kind of laughed at myself.

797
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:11,839
But then it became a kind of fad about 20 years ago, I don't know if it still is, to read the Bible that way.

798
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:16,759
There are books and books saying, well, look, I'll give you two examples.

799
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:22,999
When the Romans come to get Jesus, Peter slices off the ear of one of the Romans.

800
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:26,679
And people say, well, these are supposed to be non-violent people.

801
01:10:26,679 --> 01:10:28,119
What's he doing with the sword?

802
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:30,679
And why is he slashing off the ear of the Roman?

803
01:10:30,679 --> 01:10:32,199
It's sort of weird.

804
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:40,360
And then Jesus is weird in when he goes around and says all the time after performing miracles and saying wise things, and don't tell anybody.

805
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:47,639
As if somehow the Bible has got it into it in a way that it doesn't explain that something secret is going on.

806
01:10:47,639 --> 01:10:55,159
And as if this is kind of code for some meeting they're going to have in which they're going to plot against the Romans.

807
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:59,400
So anyway, I don't know what it would, you have to think of your own example.

808
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,639
In what way Jesus is the paradigm.

809
01:11:01,639 --> 01:11:04,119
But those are some possibilities.

810
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:04,759
Okay.

811
01:11:04,759 --> 01:11:07,160
We're going to do one more Kierkegaard next time.
