00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,960
Alyasha said, Alyasha has this terrific religious experience, spiritual experience in the middle of the book.

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:25,041
After he sees that Father Zosima has indeed performed a miracle by creating his love, which he then turns on Grushenka, and that creates a miracle for her, giving her a new option for acting, which is creative instead of destructive.

3
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,080
Thanks a lot.

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:37,481
And then, Alyasha has the last comment by Dostoevsky is the transition I want to make.

5
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:42,360
We were on 419 last time, and the experience is over.

6
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:49,560
The last thing he says about it is, it sees the sovereignty of his mind for his life and forever.

7
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:52,281
I don't know if I said it last time, but I'll say it again.

8
00:00:52,280 --> 00:01:00,681
For the Russian people listening who send me helpful comments every once in a while, it's too bad he says some idea sees the sovereignty of his mind.

9
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:06,681
It would be nice if the Russian word was something like a conviction or a notion or something.

10
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:08,681
An idea is too abstract.

11
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:23,480
What sees him is a whole sense of what it is to be a human being in touch with all the other, all the other human beings, all the other worlds of God, that is, all the other people who love each other everywhere.

12
00:01:23,481 --> 00:01:25,960
And the final thing is something later.

13
00:01:26,201 --> 00:01:27,481
I finished this last time.

14
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:29,160
I just summed it up.

15
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:41,321
The one step on 419 that was after last time and begins this time is someone visited my soul in that hour, he used to say afterwards, with implicit faith.

16
00:01:41,321 --> 00:01:52,121
Now that's interesting and strange, because the normal way to hear that would be the someone would be Jesus, I suppose.

17
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,400
God the Father doesn't go around visiting people's souls, but it isn't.

18
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,160
It's someone else.

19
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:11,321
And it's the same someone that points the way into the monastery for the mysterious visitor on 358.

20
00:02:11,321 --> 00:02:12,840
I mentioned it already.

21
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:31,600
The last thing he says, these final, these funny last things that Dostoevsky puts in, on 358, it says, I left the town, I entered, by God's grace, I entered upon the safe and blessed path, following the unseen finger that guided me so clearly to it.

22
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,161
Period.

23
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,600
Because then he talks about Michiel.

24
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,840
But Michiel is not the unseen finger.

25
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:48,321
The unseen finger is, you know, I think we talked about it, this sort of suddenly love explodes into the mind of Zosima as he's about to enter this duel.

26
00:02:48,321 --> 00:02:57,761
Who gave him the capacity for that mystical kind of total connected love that he suddenly experiences?

27
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,840
His brother Markle.

28
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:08,801
And he gave it to him by actually touching him and looking into his eyes and telling him to go out and live it.

29
00:03:09,681 --> 00:03:14,561
Let's see if I can open to that right away, where he tells him that.

30
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,441
Yes, the middle of 329.

31
00:03:17,761 --> 00:03:18,881
I went into his room.

32
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:21,920
I read it already, this quote in connection with the sun.

33
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:36,480
Of course, when one of these amazingly important religious experiences, when getting in touch with the connectedness of everything and getting therefore agape love charged up in you, so there's always the sun rays.

34
00:03:36,481 --> 00:03:44,960
He beckoned me, he put his hands on my shoulders and looked into my face lovingly, and then he said, run and play now, enjoy life for me too.

35
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:59,881
That's the moment that he gives him, he passes on to him this sort of supernatural, but not against science, but not normal nature either, agape experience.

36
00:04:00,201 --> 00:04:22,040
And I think I said it, but I'll say it one more time: that this is the existentializing of a not very interesting Christian notion, but it's something Dostoevsky's interested in: the passing on of the power to save people from Jesus to Peter and then to all the bishops from there on.

37
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,080
All they have their laying on of hands.

38
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:31,241
And Dostoevsky is saying, but that's just magic that you could pass this thing on by just laying your hands.

39
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:37,881
But it gets passed on by these emotional experiences that stay in the memory of the people.

40
00:04:37,881 --> 00:04:46,040
So Alyasha's memory of his mother holding him up to the icon, Dimitri's memory of the German doctor giving him the pound of nuts.

41
00:04:46,040 --> 00:05:06,201
And now we get another one, Markle's memory, which he says a lot he doesn't remember, but boy, does he remember this, this moment when he sort of connects with his brother and the vision that his brother has of the love.

42
00:05:06,201 --> 00:05:08,921
So now we have to just look at Markle.

43
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:26,360
It should be clear, I hope, that Markle is the existentialized, unmagical, unmythical, but also normal, because not anti-science.

44
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:33,001
Since science and religion are having such a fight these days, I want to keep saying Dostoevsky's got an answer.

45
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:41,321
Don't go around arguing about whether Christianity or any other religion, but this is Christianity, is compatible with science.

46
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:45,520
That only comes in if you think of Christianity in this magical way.

47
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:53,761
But if you think of it in what is its existential meaning, what does it mean for human beings and how does it change the way they live?

48
00:05:53,761 --> 00:05:58,800
That's not a question for physics and chemistry, nor for neuroscience.

49
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,721
Somebody came up afterwards and said, but now we know how it happens in the brain.

50
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:17,200
Keep your eyes open later in the book, when, believe it or not, Gostovsky, who thinks of everything, has Rakitin talking to Dmitry about neurons, which have just been discovered, and saying, Well, now we know neurons do it.

51
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,481
You don't have to feel guilt, and you don't have to feel repentance, and you don't get redeemed.

52
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,641
We know all now that that's all caused by neurons.

53
00:06:26,641 --> 00:06:35,361
And Alyasha's response is: if you'll keep your eye open for it, is not to answer Dimitri, but simply to ignore him.

54
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:38,400
Meaning, in effect, that's just irrelevant.

55
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:47,601
The causal basis of agape love is fine, and certainly something goes on in the brain when you experience it.

56
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:54,161
But there is also an existential meaning to it, and science can't deal with that meaning.

57
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,201
But science doesn't refute the meaning, nor do the neurons.

58
00:06:59,761 --> 00:07:07,121
So now, Markle is going to be the existentialized version of the incarnation.

59
00:07:07,121 --> 00:07:18,801
The incarnation, meaning, you know, incarnate has to do with body, the word, namely the logos of the universe, becomes flesh in Jesus.

60
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,241
And what is that now?

61
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:22,241
But all that is so strange.

62
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,641
Dostoevsky's got the job of saying, well, what does it really look like?

63
00:07:26,641 --> 00:07:42,280
Well, what he's going to do is sort of restage the original Christian sort of events as they would happen right now in order to capture what existential experience was going on.

64
00:07:42,601 --> 00:07:48,601
So the incarnate, every, I think he thinks that there can be a plurality of incarnations.

65
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,520
Markle is one of them.

66
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:59,001
Jesus was the first one, and therefore very important, because without somebody starting this, there wouldn't have been anybody else doing it.

67
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:01,001
And what is the this?

68
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:06,921
Well, the incarnation means the embodiment of God.

69
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:16,121
Now, if God is the connectedness of everything with everything, what would it be to embody that?

70
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,200
Well, look at Markle.

71
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:27,001
It would be to feel in touch with the birds and the bees and the people and his mother and the animals and feel overwhelmed with joy about it and so forth.

72
00:08:27,001 --> 00:08:37,641
And so he exhibits, in effect, that everybody's connected and how everybody's connected and what to do about the fact that everybody's connected.

73
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:42,201
That makes his story a story.

74
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,921
It's the incarnation.

75
00:08:46,121 --> 00:08:51,721
And now I will jump to what I want to do next.

76
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,201
So he reveals, I just said what I need to say about that.

77
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,001
And how does he talk?

78
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:06,441
Well, he tells you all these things on 326 and 327.

79
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,081
By the way, it may or may not be important.

80
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:16,481
I think maybe it's because Markle is so important that on 326 it looks like Markle combines all the three brothers.

81
00:09:16,481 --> 00:09:25,520
Zostima says of him on 326 that he did well at school, and we know that he reminds him of Alyasha.

82
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,761
He looks like Alyasha at the bottom of 324.

83
00:09:29,761 --> 00:09:36,321
Alyasha seems to me so like him spiritually that many times I've taken him for that young man.

84
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,121
So he's sort of reincarnated.

85
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,041
He's the incarnation and then he's reincarnated in Alyasha.

86
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:50,161
That is, Alyasha is going to also embody the love and the connectedness.

87
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,761
And he's like Yvonne.

88
00:09:51,761 --> 00:09:56,801
And this is more important to us, that he's corrupted by philosophy.

89
00:09:57,361 --> 00:10:04,321
So about 10 lines down on 326, he did well at school and so forth.

90
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:12,801
Six months before his death, when he was 17, he made friends with a political exile who had been banished from Moscow to our town for free thinking.

91
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,201
That's sort of anti-religious secular thinking.

92
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,880
And led a solitary existence.

93
00:10:18,881 --> 00:10:21,920
This man was a scholar who gained distinction in philosophy.

94
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,761
That's always a bad sign.

95
00:10:23,761 --> 00:10:30,321
Yvonne is a philosopher, or does what presumably natural philosophy, sort of philosophy of science.

96
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,121
This guy does social philosophy, what will become something like Marxism.

97
00:10:35,121 --> 00:10:38,961
And all that's the wrong way to go, Dostoevsky thinks.

98
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,160
But it has a corrupting effect on Markle.

99
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,441
And that's important.

100
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,960
So the next paragraph.

101
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,520
It was the beginning of Lent, and Markle would not fast.

102
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,120
He was rude and laughed at it.

103
00:10:49,121 --> 00:10:54,641
That's all silly, and there is no God, he said, horrifying my mother and the servants, too.

104
00:10:54,641 --> 00:10:58,241
Well, that doesn't seem a very Jesus-like thing for him to do, does it?

105
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:04,201
I mean, that he's saying there is no God and laughing at the people who are religious.

106
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:09,081
Well, that's one way that Dostoevsky deviates from the tradition.

107
00:11:09,081 --> 00:11:17,481
I mean, he's enough of a thinker on his own that he's not going to just tell you everything that the Russian Orthodox Church tells you.

108
00:11:17,481 --> 00:11:45,721
And he's got this theory, which I told you once already, and since time is running out, I'm just going to remind you that unless these saving people have already had some experience which shows them what it is to be brutal and evil and selfish and so forth, they can't understand the other, the suffering of others and the tendency of others to sin.

109
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:52,921
So, Zosima, remember, was in the army and was so brutal that he slapped his orderly so hard in the face that he was covered with blood.

110
00:11:53,400 --> 00:12:01,800
And then he, at that moment, having experienced that, he suddenly remembers Markle and throws himself on the ground, or I think he does.

111
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,841
Anyway, certainly experiences that he never will do anything like that again.

112
00:12:07,721 --> 00:12:16,040
And even Markle has to have at least an understanding of what it would be to laugh at religion.

113
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,961
But it doesn't last long.

114
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:29,401
He gets tuberculosis and he's got galloping consumption, the doctor says, and he's going to die very soon.

115
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:35,241
And as soon as he does, he gets a lot of, presumably has a high fever.

116
00:12:35,241 --> 00:12:37,721
The doctor says later he has a fever.

117
00:12:37,721 --> 00:12:41,281
And again, that's something that happens in his brain.

118
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,960
Directly.

119
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,641
We don't care whether he has a fever or not.

120
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:54,961
I mean, because he has a high fever, he begins to have these sort of visions that he wouldn't have if he wasn't in a certain way going crazy.

121
00:12:54,961 --> 00:13:01,520
Remember, the doctors also say the mysterious visitor had gone crazy, only they think it's some problem with his heart.

122
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:09,201
And again, Dostoevsky doesn't care that maybe there is a problem with his neurons because of his high fever.

123
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:23,201
The question is whether he sees whether that enables him to see something real about the universe that people normally don't see because their brain has sort of got too simple and solid a grip on ordinary reality.

124
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:32,241
So he's going crazy with his high fever and sees things that other people don't see, but they're not just his imagination.

125
00:13:32,241 --> 00:13:35,921
And you know that because they have this amazing effect on people.

126
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:44,001
Markle has an effect on Saseva and gets him to give up the duel and points, he's the finger that points him into the monastery.

127
00:13:44,001 --> 00:13:51,361
And Zosima has an amazing effect on Alyasha, which points him out of the monastery into the world.

128
00:13:51,361 --> 00:13:55,760
And all of this may well be the result of brain fever, but it doesn't matter.

129
00:13:56,081 --> 00:14:02,960
It's true in the sense that it counts, that it makes things happen, very important things happen.

130
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,280
It saves Grushenka, for instance.

131
00:14:05,281 --> 00:14:07,601
So let's look at the middle of 327.

132
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:09,601
A marvelous change passed over him.

133
00:14:09,601 --> 00:14:11,680
His spirit seemed transformed.

134
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,200
He was transformed.

135
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:34,681
He was transformed from a normal, selfish, philosophical, atheistic, secular guy into even more than a saint, into somebody who brings the agape-connected love into the world and exhibits it.

136
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,841
That's how he's transformed.

137
00:14:36,841 --> 00:14:38,521
So, and now what does he do?

138
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,200
When they try to do their religious things, the old nurse would come in and say, Let me light the lamp before the holy image, my dear.

139
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:51,480
Before this, he would have allowed it, would not have allowed it, and would have blown it out.

140
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,480
Light it, light it, dear nurse.

141
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,160
I was a wretch to have prevented you from doing it before, he says.

142
00:14:57,641 --> 00:15:01,641
Now he says sort of the existentializing thing.

143
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:05,081
He says, You pray when you light the lamp, and I pray when I see you.

144
00:15:05,081 --> 00:15:07,240
So we're praying to the same God.

145
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:14,760
Meaning, it isn't the sort of magical thing of lighting the lamp or not lighting the lamp, but what lighting the lamp means.

146
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:24,361
And it means to her some devotional thing, and it means to him that he's happy that she's doing the devotional thing.

147
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:34,361
And that's now he's in this religious dimension, and he says to his mother at the bottom of the page, life is paradise, and we are all in paradise, but we refuse to see it.

148
00:15:34,361 --> 00:15:37,641
If we would, we would be in heaven on earth the next day.

149
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:59,560
That's important because, and we'll come back to it, for him, Markle, and presumably Dostoevsky thinks for primitive Christianity before it got mixed up with philosophy and Greek thinking, it wasn't that heaven was someplace else in another world, higher and better and different than this one.

150
00:15:59,561 --> 00:16:07,320
Heaven is this world, if you understand it right and relate to it right in this kind of totally loving way.

151
00:16:07,321 --> 00:16:11,560
The same thing, remember, what Deer Kierkegaard says about the afterlife.

152
00:16:11,561 --> 00:16:14,561
He says that, well, maybe there's an afterlife and maybe there isn't.

153
00:16:13,561 --> 00:16:18,480
But what's important is whether you can experience bliss in this life.

154
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:29,920
Anything short of that, anything that says that this life you can't really be fulfilled, but there's another life in which you can, is already giving away much too much.

155
00:16:31,841 --> 00:16:34,400
That says, well, this world is a terrible world.

156
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,521
We're just stuck in it.

157
00:16:35,521 --> 00:16:39,601
And you can't understand anymore why God created it and thought it was good.

158
00:16:39,601 --> 00:16:41,281
The Augustine has a problem with that.

159
00:16:41,281 --> 00:16:42,960
He thinks the world is terrible.

160
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:48,720
It's always luring you away from this direct relation to God that I drew on the board.

161
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,881
And the point is, this world is not terrible.

162
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:57,121
It's not luring you away from a direct vision and experience of God.

163
00:16:57,121 --> 00:17:02,480
This world is the experience of God, of the connectedness.

164
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,560
Okay, so he sees that.

165
00:17:04,561 --> 00:17:12,000
And he says, at the bottom of 327, dear ones, he would say, What have I done that you should love me?

166
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,440
How can you love anyone like me?

167
00:17:14,561 --> 00:17:19,040
How was I to not know I did not appreciate it before?

168
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,200
Now comes an important sense.

169
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:31,280
You're always supposed to be looking, remember, for where Dostoevsky is going to sort of hit you over the head and say, I've just existentialized the incarnation.

170
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:38,240
I've restaged the original church and Jesus' original experience.

171
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,361
And how does it happen?

172
00:17:39,361 --> 00:17:40,720
How does he tell you?

173
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,721
Well, it's the bottom of 327.

174
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,121
Those of you who aren't steeped in Christian tradition won't recognize this.

175
00:17:47,121 --> 00:17:48,160
Some of you will.

176
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,201
When the servants came in to him, he would say, Dear kind people, why are you doing so much for me?

177
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,121
Do I deserve to be waited on?

178
00:17:55,121 --> 00:18:00,200
If it were God's will for me to live, I would wait on you, for all men should wait on one another.

179
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:05,560
You recognize, I mean, that's what Jesus says when he washes or wipes the feet of Mary Magdalene.

180
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,240
Not being Christian myself, I don't know it by heart.

181
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:21,400
But I know that he's telling you, sort of, he's in a way, Mark is now plagiarizing Jesus or talking just like Jesus, talking literally what Jesus was saying.

182
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,361
And that's important, just so Dostoevsky gets you to realize, gee, I've heard that somewhere before.

183
00:18:26,361 --> 00:18:27,160
Yeah, yeah, of course.

184
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,200
That's a direct quote from the New Testament.

185
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:39,080
So, and it goes on, Mother, darling, there must be servants and masters, but if so, I will be the servant of my servants.

186
00:18:39,081 --> 00:18:43,881
And another thing, everyone is sinned against all men, and everyone more than I.

187
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:47,881
Well, that's, I don't think that's, I don't think that's something Jesus ever says.

188
00:18:47,881 --> 00:18:51,240
I mean, that's the thing that Dostoevsky teaches anything.

189
00:18:52,041 --> 00:19:06,121
Not only are we all connected in a positive way by agake love, but we're all connected in a negative way of hurting other people and doing things that make other people worse, even when we don't know it.

190
00:19:06,121 --> 00:19:09,320
That's the thing that Zosima makes such a fuss about.

191
00:19:09,321 --> 00:19:18,361
And then the doctor says at the bottom of 327, your son cannot last long, the doctor told my mother, the disease is affecting his brain.

192
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:21,641
Well, I said, yeah, the disease is affecting his brain.

193
00:19:21,641 --> 00:19:22,521
So what?

194
00:19:22,521 --> 00:19:30,680
That doesn't mean that he isn't having a sort of a repeat of the original experience of Jesus.

195
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:36,841
And that's what's important for Dostoevsky here, to get that experience.

196
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:38,680
Now, let me see where I am.

197
00:19:39,561 --> 00:19:47,361
So he's transformed from cynical socialist into the dimension of love.

198
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,480
I think I read that already.

199
00:19:51,841 --> 00:20:01,440
And he never goes back on his way of he never goes back to fasting and lighting the lamps and so forth.

200
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:08,881
He doesn't go, and I'll explain why in a minute, but you have to notice, he never talks really Christian talk.

201
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:16,080
He never says, yes, the icon is where you should be praying, nurse, and I'm going to pray to the icon too.

202
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:22,881
He says, you pray to the icon, and I'll appreciate the fact that you're being devoted and praying to the icon.

203
00:20:24,561 --> 00:20:28,160
He's not demythologizing or demagicalizing.

204
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,761
He's pre-magicalizing.

205
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:47,040
That is, here's an understanding of this kind of love before it got put into the symbols and language and rituals of Christianity, which is the first thing that happens in the church or in the Christian community.

206
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:51,121
And it's before it gets made into a church.

207
00:20:51,121 --> 00:20:54,240
And it's before it gets Platonized.

208
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,881
He's just, and so he never says any sort of, as far as I know, if you find places that contradict it, let me know.

209
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:08,081
He doesn't say anything specifically, magically gospel, New Testament-like.

210
00:21:08,321 --> 00:21:12,160
He says we're all servants of servants, but that's not magical.

211
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,361
That's this experience of interconnectedness.

212
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:16,641
He's got that.

213
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:19,920
What he hasn't got is a way of talking about it.

214
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:40,200
Now, that turns out to be important because if you want to ask yourself what happened to Markle, why did, why does, how do I put it, the two people who have the experience of the connectedness before Zosima has it, go crazy and die.

215
00:21:40,521 --> 00:21:44,200
That is the mysterious visitor and now Markle.

216
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,960
Why does that have to happen?

217
00:21:46,281 --> 00:21:52,841
And that is really tied up with why did Jesus have to die in an existentialized way?

218
00:21:53,160 --> 00:22:09,641
The idea is that this experience is so overpowering, so absolutely against everyday human nature of selfishness and protectedness and wanting other people to be your servants and not you theirs and everything.

219
00:22:09,641 --> 00:22:17,720
The whole way everyday life is organized and the whole way we can think about it and make sense of it is contradicted by this experience.

220
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,201
I mean, take the extreme case that we should love the birds and the animals and ask forgiveness.

221
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,400
That's crazy.

222
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:32,601
Nothing in our experience suggests that we should do it or why we should do it or what good it would do to do it or what bad it would do not to do it.

223
00:22:32,841 --> 00:22:36,680
It's just an amazingly contradictory experience.

224
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,720
And that's so that you can't live in this normal world once you see it.

225
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,800
That's the moral.

226
00:22:43,801 --> 00:22:51,720
And so it looks like craziness once you see it because you can't really make, you can't explain to anybody what's going on.

227
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:58,520
You can't relate to the people except in this way that they can't understand, which is this overwhelming love.

228
00:22:58,521 --> 00:23:14,561
So you end up, that is, at least in our existentialized way, Markle, the incarnation, the God-man is in our book, Jesus in our book, will definitely have to go crazy and die.

229
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:16,320
He doesn't have to get crucified.

230
00:23:16,641 --> 00:23:18,321
Crucified is another issue.

231
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:19,681
Dimitri gets crucified.

232
00:23:19,841 --> 00:23:27,440
Dimitri, Dostoevsky sort of divides up the various parts of being an incarnation.

233
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,680
I'm not going to get time to talk about Dimitri, so I'll just say it right now.

234
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:36,080
Notice how Dimitri keeps talking about suffering and being crucified.

235
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:51,680
And you will see that Dostoevsky is hitting you over the head to watch the way Dimitri suffers, because his suffering is the kind of suffering that is Christian suffering, which will lead to joy in the end.

236
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,561
And there's a whole story to be said about that.

237
00:23:54,561 --> 00:24:02,800
And anybody who wants to write about Dimitri and crucifixion can, that is, suffering, can do it.

238
00:24:02,801 --> 00:24:06,001
But Dostoevsky doesn't, he separates them on purpose.

239
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:19,040
There's the joy of getting in touch with this love, and then there's how to deal with getting in touch with your guilt for having caused very bad things in the world, more than you even realize.

240
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,480
So now I'm going back to here.

241
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:28,081
So he's got this pure love now, and he's got this extreme Christian vision.

242
00:24:28,081 --> 00:24:33,440
I'm just wanting to make sure I've read the passages I want, yeah, that we're in paradise and we don't see it.

243
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,841
And that he's got brain fever.

244
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:39,361
That's where we are, at the bottom of 3.28.

245
00:24:39,361 --> 00:24:45,601
And anybody who experiences this pure kind of love must go crazy.

246
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:53,200
The idiot, too, another one of the Jesus figures in the book, Dostoevsky's book, The Idiot, goes crazy.

247
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:54,400
It just happens.

248
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,200
You just can't cope with it.

249
00:24:58,281 --> 00:25:10,841
So the question becomes: how come they can experience this love at all, given that they're selfish people like everybody else, and now they've experienced this total love?

250
00:25:10,841 --> 00:25:14,361
And the answer is, well, they can't really live that way.

251
00:25:14,361 --> 00:25:15,400
I'm just repeating myself.

252
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:22,040
They have no precedent for it, no language, no practices, no institutions, no way of making sense of it.

253
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:29,080
They just experience this connectedness, and that makes them stop being normal, sane human beings.

254
00:25:29,081 --> 00:25:35,240
And Dostoevsky's way of describing that is they just look crazy.

255
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,920
And so now he's going off and looking crazy.

256
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,321
That's where we have to see what's next.

257
00:25:43,561 --> 00:25:50,760
Then he talks about loving the birds and the animals at the bottom of 367.

258
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,560
And you should pray to the birds.

259
00:25:54,841 --> 00:25:58,440
Consumed by an all-embracing love in a sort of transport.

260
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,400
You see, he's just sort of, this is sort of his madness, just a typical.

261
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:05,800
If somebody starts talking like that and thinking like that, they look crazy.

262
00:26:06,121 --> 00:26:10,520
You're consumed in an all-embracing love, in a sort of transport.

263
00:26:10,521 --> 00:26:13,560
You would pray that they too would forgive you, the animals.

264
00:26:13,561 --> 00:26:17,560
Treasure that ecstasy, however senseless it may seem to men.

265
00:26:17,561 --> 00:26:18,281
You see that?

266
00:26:18,281 --> 00:26:28,841
I mean, that's another way of saying, I'm experiencing something that if you experienced it, you should think it's a wonderful thing to experience it, even though it seems to you and everybody else crazy.

267
00:26:28,841 --> 00:26:31,321
And that's as far as we get with that.

268
00:26:31,321 --> 00:26:34,680
Michael dies and so forth.

269
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:44,241
So, well, how then do these existentialized Jesus figures who are even crazier than Jesus?

270
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,000
I don't think Jesus ever asked the birds for forgiveness.

271
00:26:48,000 --> 00:27:07,361
But these people who don't read the Bible, don't use the symbols from the Bible, don't sort of restrict agape love to other people the way the Bible does, how do they ever get into being sort of stable and sane Christians?

272
00:27:07,361 --> 00:27:10,480
And that's the next thing we have to talk about.

273
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,840
Let me see now.

274
00:27:11,841 --> 00:27:14,320
I want to make sure we got everything.

275
00:27:14,641 --> 00:27:15,361
Yeah.

276
00:27:15,361 --> 00:27:27,920
Now, so I've now convinced you, I hope, or done my best, that if you have this experience, you seem crazy to yourself, and you seem crazy to everybody else, and in a certain sense, you are crazy.

277
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,000
And then what happens?

278
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:49,841
Well, I already said what you need is a language, sort of rituals, shared experiences, institutions that make this intelligible and bring it under control so you're not in this sort of mind-blowing, literally mind-blowing state all the time.

279
00:27:49,841 --> 00:27:51,200
And what is that?

280
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,641
Well, that's the church.

281
00:27:52,641 --> 00:28:03,920
The church takes this crazy experience and tames it and makes it intelligible by writing the Bible, for instance, the New Testament.

282
00:28:04,321 --> 00:28:06,241
They're all busy trying to explain it.

283
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,200
Paul's trying his way, and John is trying his way, and none of them have got it very clear.

284
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:20,080
It turns out, if you look at the Bible carefully, some of them think there's a Trinity, some of them think there's a duality about God, some of them think there's only one.

285
00:28:21,361 --> 00:28:23,920
And it's all mixed up.

286
00:28:24,081 --> 00:28:29,081
But gradually, there are people who are called church fathers who work hard to straighten it all out.

287
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:37,320
And they form, they write credos that state the things you have to believe if you're a Christian, and so forth.

288
00:28:37,321 --> 00:28:39,960
And that, now I want to give you the overall picture.

289
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:47,720
That's the second stage of Dostoevsky's three-stage story about how the world is going to be saved.

290
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,961
We've done the first stage, but I just didn't name it.

291
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:58,041
The first stage is primitive Christianity before it has a language, before it has a church, before it knows what it's doing.

292
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,400
And we just did that.

293
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,520
Markle is primitive Christianity at stage one.

294
00:29:04,841 --> 00:29:08,841
Who would be the next stage in our book?

295
00:29:08,841 --> 00:29:10,200
Zosima, yes.

296
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,761
The next stage is to institutionalize it.

297
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:19,480
They withdraw from the world because the world is too worldly and secular for them.

298
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,960
It can't support this kind of love and craziness.

299
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:32,440
You can't go around on the street falling on your knees at the beggars and saying you're worse than they are and you're very sorry that you're so evil.

300
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,200
Anyway, it's all crazy.

301
00:29:34,361 --> 00:29:36,761
You can't go around talking to all the animals all the time.

302
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,200
They'll certainly lock you up.

303
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:45,641
But anyway, by the time you fix it, you make it into a shared way of life.

304
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,200
And you withdraw from these people in the world who can't understand you and think you're crazy.

305
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:57,881
And you find a language in which you're not crazy anymore because you can understand each other and confess and love each other and so forth.

306
00:29:57,881 --> 00:29:59,560
And that is stage two.

307
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,240
So we have to look at stage two, because that's where most of the book takes place.

308
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:22,641
So when Markle's love gets stored up in Zosima, when it finally breaks out in Zosima, when he feels terrible about what he did to his orderly and throws away his gun at the duel and says, look, the world is beautiful and everybody should love everybody.

309
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:31,920
When that happens, then Marko has pointed the way to the monastery, Zosima says.

310
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:55,121
That's Zosima's kind of, I don't know, poetic or magical or Christian way of saying that thanks to having been loved by his brother and seeing his brother exhibit this kind of love, he is drawn to go into this institution where the love is preserved.

311
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,400
And I think maybe that's on 329.

312
00:30:58,401 --> 00:30:59,680
I mean, I don't want to snow.

313
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,360
No, that's when he passes it on.

314
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,121
So let me go further.

315
00:31:03,121 --> 00:31:08,721
So that's the apostolic succession, and Marko is in it.

316
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,680
And Zosima receive a kind of ordination from Markle.

317
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:18,720
That's when Marko puts his hands on him, and Alyasha receives it from Zosima.

318
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,880
I'll just mention that, but I'm going to go back to talking about Zosima.

319
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,081
But I gave you a wrong example in 85.

320
00:31:26,081 --> 00:31:30,880
I said that in the dream, Zosima blesses Alyasha.

321
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:38,641
But even before the dream, in real life, at the top of 85, it says, Father Zosima raised his hand to bless him.

322
00:31:38,641 --> 00:31:42,241
So, Zosima, that's when Zosima passes it on.

323
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,401
But let's go back.

324
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,401
Now we hear Zosima was an almost savage creature.

325
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,160
He strikes his orderly.

326
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,361
That's on 336 and 339.

327
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,641
I won't read them.

328
00:31:54,961 --> 00:31:56,480
He goes to the duel.

329
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:57,920
He refuses to shoot.

330
00:31:57,921 --> 00:32:05,000
And then we better read what happens, what he says on 342, because he's channeling, in effect, Markle at that point.

331
00:32:05,401 --> 00:32:08,521
It suddenly dawns on him.

332
00:32:08,521 --> 00:32:10,121
It takes him over.

333
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,841
340.

334
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,760
Oh, I'm looking in the wrong place.

335
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,761
Yeah, he says, this should sound familiar, top of 342.

336
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:25,960
Gentlemen, I cried, suddenly, speaking straight from my heart, look around you with the gifts of God, the clear air, the pure air, the tendergrass, the birds.

337
00:32:25,961 --> 00:32:27,561
Nature is beautiful and sinless.

338
00:32:27,561 --> 00:32:34,361
Only we have sinned, and we don't understand that life is heaven, that's here and now in the world, this paradise.

339
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:41,160
We have only to understand that, and it will at once be fulfilled in all its beauty, and we shall embrace each other and weep.

340
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:46,921
So that's Osima getting the stage one primitive Christian experience.

341
00:32:46,921 --> 00:32:56,521
But instead of going crazy from getting the stage one experience, which sounds pretty crazy there, he goes in the monastery where it's not crazy.

342
00:32:56,521 --> 00:32:57,320
And that's that.

343
00:32:57,401 --> 00:32:59,641
So now we get to stage two.

344
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:04,521
And now we get something on 367.

345
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,520
Oh, he's telling them more about how everything is connected and so forth.

346
00:33:09,081 --> 00:33:10,841
He still holds that.

347
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:22,761
But he holds it now in its Christianized language and in the institution of elders where people understand each other and don't have to go crazy.

348
00:33:25,001 --> 00:33:29,241
Now, I'm just summing up what I wrote here.

349
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:38,521
Those who receive this ecstatic Christian experience, not yet Christian experience, have to institutionalize it and make it livable.

350
00:33:38,521 --> 00:33:43,160
And that's what the elders and the people in the monastery do.

351
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,601
They start, it starts already when the New Testament tries to make sense of it.

352
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,601
And in the monastery, they've got a whole ritual for doing with it, dealing with it.

353
00:33:53,601 --> 00:34:00,561
But it's in the second stage, and this is the next important point, they are corrupted by philosophy.

354
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,521
This is not an important thing to Dostoevsky.

355
00:34:03,521 --> 00:34:05,281
I don't even know if he thinks about it.

356
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:18,481
But Zosima not only talks in Christian terms about the afterlife and how God is watching you and how you should pray to Him, he says this to the old woman whose son has died, for instance, does it several times.

357
00:34:18,481 --> 00:34:24,641
But the worst thing he says is on 368, two-thirds down.

358
00:34:24,641 --> 00:34:36,401
It's interesting, just because if you aren't tuned into the stuff I'm telling you, you think, well, Zosima knows the truth, and Zosima says this, this must be what Dostoevsky believes.

359
00:34:36,401 --> 00:34:40,561
Well, this is what Dostoevsky believes, stage two Christianity is about.

360
00:34:40,561 --> 00:34:44,160
But that doesn't mean that he believes that that's the last word.

361
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:50,001
That's a necessary stage to go through to try to put it into philosophical terms.

362
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:51,441
But it doesn't really work.

363
00:34:51,921 --> 00:34:56,800
And now here's where you can see it going wrong at the two-thirds of down on 368.

364
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:01,680
Zosima says, on earth indeed, we are, as it were, astray.

365
00:35:02,401 --> 00:35:05,601
Is that a markle sentiment?

366
00:35:05,921 --> 00:35:13,200
Or even a Zothima sentiment when he first gets hit with a Markle Lammy that somehow on earth we're astray.

367
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:19,521
Were it not for the precious image of Christ before us, we'd be undone altogether and lost.

368
00:35:19,521 --> 00:35:24,641
Well, if you translate that so that it means markle, it's true.

369
00:35:24,641 --> 00:35:28,080
But he gives it a philosophical slant.

370
00:35:28,081 --> 00:35:35,081
He says, much on earth is hidden, and so forth and so forth, but we've got a mystical sense of our living bond with the other world.

371
00:35:35,081 --> 00:35:38,921
Now comes the problem with the higher heavenly world.

372
00:35:38,921 --> 00:35:40,521
Where's the problem?

373
00:35:41,481 --> 00:35:44,840
Is there a higher heavenly world that we're connected to?

374
00:35:46,121 --> 00:35:46,760
It's here.

375
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,400
It's now.

376
00:35:47,401 --> 00:35:47,800
Good.

377
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,360
Okay.

378
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,081
Yes.

379
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:50,360
We are in paradise.

380
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,160
We are in heaven here and now if we could only see it.

381
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,881
That's the right thing to say.

382
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:07,721
But Markle, sorry, but Zosima is part of the church, and the church got sort of trying hard to make sense of all this, turned it into this platonic story, that there's a better world.

383
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,080
So let me go on there.

384
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:14,841
The higher heavenly world and the roots of our thoughts and feeling are not here, but in other worlds.

385
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:19,561
That's why the philosophers say that we can't understand the reality of things on earth.

386
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:21,160
Very bad, very bad.

387
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:29,801
It's true that the philosophers can't understand the reality of things on earth, but that shows that they're wrong, not that we should believe it.

388
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,361
Now, I wouldn't harp on this so much, but there was such a funny thing that happened.

389
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:40,680
About a few times back when I gave this course, the new translation of the brothers had just come out.

390
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:45,001
And it was considered just the hottest thing, the best translation.

391
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:48,521
And I happened to be, and I was looking at the footnotes.

392
00:36:48,521 --> 00:36:54,921
I just want to read you this to caution you that just because something's printed in a book doesn't mean that you should believe it.

393
00:36:55,081 --> 00:37:13,680
Here's a footnote to that very passage, the passage where Zosima goes most wrong in giving a philosophical, platonic, otherworldly interpretation of this new form of life, which is what Markle and found.

394
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:17,280
And even Zosima lives, but he doesn't understand it very well.

395
00:37:17,601 --> 00:37:21,760
Footnote says, where he says, much on earth is, what's the phrase?

396
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,481
Where was I again?

397
00:37:22,481 --> 00:37:23,360
I have to go back to it.

398
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,801
368.

399
00:37:27,521 --> 00:37:33,601
Much on earth is hidden from us, but we have the sense of the other world, the higher heavenly world.

400
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,041
It seems to me you can make up your own mind.

401
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:40,081
I say that's where Zosima goes wrong.

402
00:37:40,081 --> 00:37:45,761
That's a sort of a hint of where the second stage of Christianity goes wrong.

403
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:54,481
It doesn't understand that the Christianity coming from Marko and Jesus is going to save this world.

404
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,320
Well, look at this footnote.

405
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:57,680
Like that one.

406
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,160
He says, Victor Terius, I've never explained who that is.

407
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,920
Obviously, some paper the Spanish translator has read.

408
00:38:05,921 --> 00:38:18,080
Victor Terius rightly considers the passage from here to the end of the chapter to be the master key to the philosophical interpretation and the structure of the brothers Karamazov.

409
00:38:18,401 --> 00:38:21,121
It's 180 degrees wrong, but it's interesting.

410
00:38:21,121 --> 00:38:35,041
And why it's wrong, it's because this guy, whoever it is, is sort of falls for the way Greek philosophy about there being another world, a better world, and what Augustine fell for.

411
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:47,041
By the way, Augustine, when I keep criticizing him, though he's a saint in our Roman Catholic world, the Russian Orthodox don't make Augustine a saint.

412
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:49,440
I think that's terrific and to their credit.

413
00:38:49,441 --> 00:38:50,720
And I think it's the same point.

414
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,961
I mean, that's Augustine talk, so to speak.

415
00:38:52,961 --> 00:38:59,801
And Augustine is certainly part of the second stage, but it's not the part of the second stage that gets things right.

416
00:38:56,561 --> 00:39:02,441
It's a part of the second stage that gets it wrong.

417
00:38:58,401 --> 00:39:03,400
You've got to think.

418
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,441
If you wanted, here's another way to put it.

419
00:39:06,441 --> 00:39:08,601
What would be the third stage?

420
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:23,721
The third stage might be sort of leaving this world to go to the better one when you die or by meditation or however, get out of this sinful, suffering world to paradise.

421
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,041
That would be the mistake.

422
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:29,641
And so, and what was I starting to say?

423
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:30,680
Wait a minute.

424
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,920
I have lost my own way of why I decided to say it.

425
00:39:37,401 --> 00:39:39,721
That would be the mistake.

426
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,561
And it is in here.

427
00:39:42,521 --> 00:39:44,601
I'll find myself in a second.

428
00:39:44,601 --> 00:39:48,761
So we don't want to go to a better spiritual world.

429
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,440
We've got to get in touch with the connectedness now.

430
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,641
Well, I don't know what I was going to say, but I'm going to find it in a minute.

431
00:39:57,641 --> 00:39:58,121
It's okay.

432
00:39:58,121 --> 00:39:58,840
Well, let's look.

433
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:03,561
I mean, I guess the way to say it isn't what I was going to say, but maybe you remember what I was going to say.

434
00:40:03,561 --> 00:40:08,200
It's the monastery, remember, is the safe path, as Osima says.

435
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:31,241
The safe path is the one that saves you from craziness, makes it all sensible, makes it into respectable philosophy that any sensible maybe person can understand, and takes all the mystery and overwhelmingness out of it.

436
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,680
But it has to go in the monastery for that period.

437
00:40:34,921 --> 00:40:35,960
Oh, I knew what I was going to say.

438
00:40:35,961 --> 00:40:37,240
I knew it would come back to me.

439
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,401
So, what would be the third stage?

440
00:40:39,961 --> 00:40:46,561
If the monastery one is a necessary stage, because otherwise they'd be crazy.

441
00:40:46,561 --> 00:40:53,601
But it's a necessary stage that makes it so sensible that it's not crazy anymore, but it's not, it's lost the point.

442
00:40:53,601 --> 00:40:54,080
Yeah?

443
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:58,801
The government, you church, the use of the environment.

444
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,520
Exactly.

445
00:40:59,521 --> 00:41:03,760
But never mind, like the monastery, because you leave behind.

446
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,961
You want to say something?

447
00:41:04,961 --> 00:41:05,441
Okay.

448
00:41:05,441 --> 00:41:25,121
You leave behind the language, the rituals, the Bible talk, and you go out in the world and you existentialize the whole thing into something not secular, because that would be against the spiritual, but something worldly, something that can happen here.

449
00:41:25,121 --> 00:41:26,880
And that's the third stage.

450
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,041
The third stage is that Christianity is going to go out into the world.

451
00:41:31,041 --> 00:41:35,920
Now, how it does it, you ought to be able partly to figure out.

452
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,520
Let's go through it.

453
00:41:37,521 --> 00:41:42,081
What do you have to do to get out of stage two and into stage three?

454
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,521
What does Osima do with Alyasha?

455
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,801
He sends him out of the monastery for good.

456
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,720
He says, your place is not here.

457
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,840
You've got to get in the world.

458
00:41:51,921 --> 00:41:56,160
He doesn't even say, I used to think it said somewhere, when you get old, you can come back here.

459
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,440
But it doesn't, I don't think.

460
00:41:57,441 --> 00:41:58,641
I can't find that passage.

461
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,721
It vanished in my reading.

462
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,561
Osima, I will have to read it.

463
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:10,320
It says, you've got to get out of the monastery and get married and stay out of the monastery when you're not going to be a monk and so forth.

464
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,361
But let me see if I've got the passages now.

465
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:19,680
This is how you go from stage one to stage two.

466
00:42:20,961 --> 00:42:23,440
That is, I don't know why that's in it.

467
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:24,961
327.

468
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:25,840
Well, I don't know.

469
00:42:25,921 --> 00:42:28,561
I read this, I think, already, but I see myself saying it again.

470
00:42:29,481 --> 00:42:36,280
I did read when Markle says life is paradise and we're in paradise, only we don't see it, and so forth.

471
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,840
That's what you've got to get out of the monastery to experience.

472
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,240
Yeah.

473
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:49,800
So Father Chai on page 388, he says when that's where I got it.

474
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,361
380 is he says you'll come back again.

475
00:42:52,601 --> 00:42:54,920
But Zosima, I think, says you won't come back again.

476
00:42:54,921 --> 00:42:58,041
But I think that's interesting.

477
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,001
That's how I got the idea that he would come back.

478
00:43:01,001 --> 00:43:03,321
Well, maybe he will come back.

479
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,240
I think he will come back.

480
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,121
So let's find out.

481
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,481
What does Zason say?

482
00:43:07,481 --> 00:43:09,320
We have to find out now what Zosima says.

483
00:43:09,401 --> 00:43:16,521
So it is like angry because Zosima's body is smelling and Father Days and he would still come back.

484
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,200
Like, he does come back.

485
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,961
He comes back after the religious experience.

486
00:43:22,921 --> 00:43:23,880
Then he maybe leaves.

487
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,241
Let's find the place where Zosima sends him out.

488
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:32,281
You guys are helping me get clear about something that I have never been quite clear about.

489
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,641
So let's see.

490
00:43:33,641 --> 00:43:37,960
The monks, they retire from the world to keep their faith.

491
00:43:37,961 --> 00:43:40,680
I'm going to sort of lead up to where we are.

492
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,240
And now we want to know how they get out of there.

493
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:52,841
But I want to read you, this is my favorite quote for what the monks do in the second stage on 359, that top paragraph about halfway down.

494
00:43:52,840 --> 00:44:00,840
Meanwhile, in their solitude, they keep the image of Christ fair and undefiled in the purity of God's truth from the time of the fathers of old.

495
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,320
Those are the church fathers making sense of this.

496
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,160
The apostles and the martyrs.

497
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,680
And when the time comes, they will show it to the tottering creeds of the world.

498
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:09,960
That is the great thought.

499
00:44:09,961 --> 00:44:11,960
That is the star that will rise out of the east.

500
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,601
That points you from stage two to stage three.

501
00:44:13,481 --> 00:44:19,841
Now, how now I'm going to go on and see what when, and now we get to stage three.

502
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,280
So he's told to leave the monastery on page 84.

503
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,200
We have to read how he's told.

504
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,561
Okay, here we go.

505
00:44:28,561 --> 00:44:29,760
Middle 84.

506
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,641
This is the kind of thing you have to take risks when you teach or when you write papers.

507
00:44:34,641 --> 00:44:40,320
I mean, you have to go out on a limb with a hypothesis, and then sometimes you get it right, and sometimes you get it wrong.

508
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,721
When you get it wrong, you learn from your mistakes.

509
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,401
I'm about to find out whether I hallucinated this.

510
00:44:46,401 --> 00:44:49,360
When it's God's will to call me, leave the monastery.

511
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,641
Go away for good.

512
00:44:50,641 --> 00:44:52,561
Aha, that's what I remembered.

513
00:44:52,561 --> 00:44:53,121
What is it?

514
00:44:53,121 --> 00:44:54,321
This is not the place.

515
00:44:54,641 --> 00:44:56,320
This is not your place for the time.

516
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,801
I bless you to the great service in the world.

517
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,920
It's ambiguous, isn't it?

518
00:44:59,921 --> 00:45:04,561
First he says, go away for good, and then he says, well, this isn't the time for you to be here.

519
00:45:04,561 --> 00:45:05,680
Somebody's confused.

520
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,761
I don't know whether it's Dostoevsky or whether I am or something deep is going on.

521
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:15,441
Yours will be a long pilgrimage, and you will have to take a wife, too, which is Lisa, of course.

522
00:45:16,561 --> 00:45:19,600
You will have much to bear before you come back.

523
00:45:19,921 --> 00:45:21,680
There will be much to do.

524
00:45:22,001 --> 00:45:23,040
Aha.

525
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:24,561
So he's coming back.

526
00:45:24,561 --> 00:45:25,440
And who says that?

527
00:45:25,441 --> 00:45:27,200
Zosima says it.

528
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:33,121
Zosima just says, go away for good, and then he says something about what happens when you come back.

529
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,000
Boy.

530
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:38,160
But I have trust in you, and so I send you forth.

531
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,200
Christ is with you.

532
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,801
See, that's Christian talk.

533
00:45:41,121 --> 00:45:42,961
Alexa is not going to talk that way.

534
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,641
Do you not abandon him?

535
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,241
He'll not abandon you.

536
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,921
You will see great sorrow, and in that sorrow you will bring happiness.

537
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:53,361
And the remember why words and so forth.

538
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,241
Wow.

539
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,001
Well, either, I mean, I don't know what to say.

540
00:45:59,001 --> 00:46:00,360
I mean, I like it.

541
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:03,081
I like it better if he didn't ever came.

542
00:46:03,401 --> 00:46:09,721
It doesn't fit the three stages, which I'm sure is very important in the book.

543
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:13,801
That when you leave the monastery, you leave the safe path.

544
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,880
Why would he ever come back to the safe path?

545
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:20,360
I mean, as long as he's alive, he's got to be helping people.

546
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:28,840
He's got to be playing his role as an angel to fight the devil, which is always there fighting for people's souls, as in the chart I gave you.

547
00:46:30,441 --> 00:46:32,200
So, I don't know what to say.

548
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,801
Come and tell me in office hours if you know, or tell me right now, even better.

549
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,281
Well, I think that's the right feeling.

550
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,641
I think that that's sort of you have to put the two together somehow.

551
00:46:43,641 --> 00:46:53,561
One, that as long as he's sort of active and so forth, it's not, he shouldn't be in the monastery and he has to leave it for good.

552
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:54,680
That's the first thing.

553
00:46:54,680 --> 00:47:08,040
But when he's really old and, so to speak, retires, in the sense that he just hasn't got the strength anymore to go traveling around and blasting people with agape, then he can come back here.

554
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,200
It sort of mixes it in a way that I don't like.

555
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:24,680
I mean, because you really want to say that once you've brought this love out into the world, I guess you have to say, well, the monastery is no longer the safe path, but it's the retirement home.

556
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,521
It's become a retirement home.

557
00:47:26,521 --> 00:47:30,601
That's exactly what you were saying, and exactly the only way to think of it.

558
00:47:30,601 --> 00:47:41,641
I mean, it's not doing its job anymore of being the preserver of the Christian message, because you'd better go out in the real world now with the Christian message.

559
00:47:41,641 --> 00:47:50,160
But it is just incidentally a place where you could go to rest when you're really, really done your work.

560
00:47:50,561 --> 00:47:51,840
I haven't anything more to say.

561
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:58,160
I'm convinced that it's no longer doing its monastery job once Alyasha leaves.

562
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,321
And in that sense, he leaves for good.

563
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:07,680
Whether it's doing some kind of humane retirement job, I have no, I see that he must go ahead, help me.

564
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,001
Okay, well, good, help me by changing the subject.

565
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:19,441
In what sense, I kind of retake the universal and express your religiousness to the universal beings.

566
00:48:19,441 --> 00:48:23,280
Ah, but that's good, but it's wrong in an interesting way.

567
00:48:23,601 --> 00:48:36,721
He never thinks that you spread the love by philosophical means, by preaching, by telling somebody something that's a universal kind of truth, any more than he believes anymore in the universal church.

568
00:48:36,961 --> 00:48:41,521
But it's good because the question would then be, well, what does he do?

569
00:48:41,521 --> 00:48:49,680
Well, Dostoevsky saves a lot of important things for the last few pages of the book, which we'll get to two or three times from here.

570
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:56,160
One of them is what replaces the church and how it goes out into the world.

571
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,240
And he's going to show you how it is.

572
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,481
He's set up a lot of little pieces of it.

573
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:13,520
What do you actually do if you want to start transforming the world so that the state will become the church, which is the right thing that must happen.

574
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,320
Another, remember, you want to be a Christian socialist.

575
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,960
You've got to transform the people from being selfish people.

576
00:49:19,121 --> 00:49:24,641
You can't just establish socialism by declaring people should share things.

577
00:49:24,641 --> 00:49:29,721
You've got to turn people into the kind of beings that love each other and do share things.

578
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,680
And how do you do that?

579
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,321
Not by preaching philosophy, for sure.

580
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,400
So you look like you want to say something more.

581
00:49:37,561 --> 00:49:51,561
What I want to say is that what says his decision to go into the monastery and getting away from the world Christiana's phrase teach, a resignation for the Christian aspect of love, you know.

582
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,520
Well, it good, good, good.

583
00:49:54,521 --> 00:49:56,040
Well, it's a kind of resignation.

584
00:49:56,041 --> 00:50:00,680
It's better not to relate it to Kierkegaard because that's such a special thing, infinite resignation.

585
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:04,840
You've got to have a defining commitment and all that stuff, like in Hiroshima Monomore.

586
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,641
It is a kind of resignation.

587
00:50:07,641 --> 00:50:12,840
It's a kind of resignation which says we can't transform the world, we monks.

588
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:22,601
Well, the most we can do is keep the image alive till the conditions are right for transforming the world, and then it'll go out in the world.

589
00:50:22,601 --> 00:50:25,400
And now I'm back to where I am talking about this.

590
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:35,160
The conditions are right, and Alyasha goes out into the world, and he and two things are clear that you've got to keep your eyes open for when you read.

591
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,641
He doesn't perform any miracles until he leaves.

592
00:50:39,641 --> 00:50:43,721
I mean, he leaves, well, he sort of comes back for his clothes, maybe, or something.

593
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:51,081
But when he runs out of the monastery and throws himself on the ground, he's ready to perform the first miracle on Grushenka.

594
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:54,121
And he performs lots more saving miracles.

595
00:50:54,121 --> 00:50:55,960
He's the angel of the book.

596
00:50:55,961 --> 00:51:00,680
Everybody, he helps everybody at some point or another, and they all call him an angel.

597
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:14,241
And that's when he is no longer on the safe path, which is a kind of resignation, and he's actually doing it, which is certainly not a kind of resignation.

598
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:18,880
And it's so much, resignation makes it sound too pessimistic.

599
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:32,001
Father Zosima is joyful because he knows that they've kept alive this experience and this message by making it safe, but they've at least kept it alive.

600
00:51:32,001 --> 00:51:33,601
And he's very ambivalent about it.

601
00:51:33,601 --> 00:51:39,200
Maybe that ambivalence is related to whether he should come back to the Alyasha should come back to the monastery or not.

602
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:46,241
He's ambivalent about it in that he thinks that it's a good thing that they retired and kept this alive.

603
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:53,601
But he also knows that it's a kind of cop-out because it's a safe path, and he should feel guilty about having done it.

604
00:51:53,601 --> 00:52:03,041
So he feels a combination of being joyful to be there in the loving community, which is preserving Agape love.

605
00:52:03,041 --> 00:52:15,680
He feels joyful about that, but he feels resigned or sad that he's not going to see the promised land, so to speak, to talk Bible talk like Moses does and Martin Luther King does.

606
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:20,641
To see the promised land is to go out and turn the world into paradise.

607
00:52:20,641 --> 00:52:21,921
He can't do that.

608
00:52:22,081 --> 00:52:23,121
He knows he can.

609
00:52:23,121 --> 00:52:27,761
You can call it resignation if you want, as long as you say that he leads a joyful life, too.

610
00:52:28,081 --> 00:52:33,841
Okay, let me go on because it gets clearer what happens with Alyasha, which is so nice.

611
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:37,121
So he's sending him out into the world on 84.

612
00:52:37,121 --> 00:52:39,200
On 85, I don't know what's happening.

613
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:45,441
That's when Zosima just blesses him to do it.

614
00:52:45,441 --> 00:52:49,521
And he will now, okay, now let's see.

615
00:52:50,800 --> 00:53:00,521
Eventually, Dostoevsky believe that Christianity in this existentialized form will take over all of Russia and from there the entire world.

616
00:52:58,481 --> 00:53:05,800
But it won't be Christianity as we know it after 2,000 years of institutionalized Christianity.

617
00:53:06,121 --> 00:53:07,961
It'll be Markle's truth.

618
00:53:07,961 --> 00:53:14,521
It'll be this ecstatic experience of the world here and now as paradise.

619
00:53:14,521 --> 00:53:22,521
So we don't want to say that it ever gets secularized, remember I said, but it gets existentialized.

620
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:37,720
This unrational, supernatural experience of agape gets, well, at first it gets sheltered by the monastery, stage two, and then it gets expressed in a way that is worldly.

621
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,400
I need a word for it, you'll see why.

622
00:53:39,401 --> 00:53:40,520
Not secular.

623
00:53:40,521 --> 00:53:42,441
That's the opposite of spiritual.

624
00:53:42,441 --> 00:53:44,601
It's spiritual, but it's worldly.

625
00:53:44,601 --> 00:53:46,841
It's not withdrawn from the world.

626
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,921
So we're going to see that now.

627
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:54,520
He looks completely worldly when he leaves.

628
00:53:54,521 --> 00:53:55,880
I mean, that's the way to see.

629
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:02,841
Alyosha is not transformed because he's already been transformed when he threw himself on the ground.

630
00:54:03,961 --> 00:54:08,840
He's, I don't know, sort of demonasteryized, demonked.

631
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:16,360
On the bottom of 202, or the two-thirds down on 202, the boys tease him for being a monk in silk trousers.

632
00:54:16,521 --> 00:54:19,240
I have to say that only so you can appreciate.

633
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:25,400
Dostoevsky says it, I think, so you can appreciate what he looks like when he leaves on 616.

634
00:54:25,481 --> 00:54:32,680
Doesn't matter if you made it there, although if you don't hurry and read it over the coming weekend, I'm going to tell you the plot.

635
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:36,280
You're going to have to discover who the murderer is and so forth.

636
00:54:36,601 --> 00:54:37,561
But here we are.

637
00:54:37,561 --> 00:54:38,760
This won't give away anything.

638
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:42,641
On 6.16, Alyosha looks different now.

639
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,840
Just the beginning of the second paragraph.

640
00:54:46,081 --> 00:54:51,200
We may note here that Alyasha's appearance had undergone a complete change since we saw him last.

641
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,520
He had abandoned his cassock, that's this robe-like thing he was wearing, whatever it was.

642
00:54:55,521 --> 00:55:00,081
He's now wearing a well-cut coat, a soft brown hat, and his hair is cropped short.

643
00:55:00,081 --> 00:55:01,921
Obviously, monks had long hair.

644
00:55:01,921 --> 00:55:05,121
All this was very becoming, and he looked quite handsome.

645
00:55:05,121 --> 00:55:06,641
Now, it's all very nice.

646
00:55:08,561 --> 00:55:10,800
That's the new Alyasha in the world.

647
00:55:11,121 --> 00:55:16,641
And that new Alyasha performs lots of miracles.

648
00:55:17,121 --> 00:55:20,000
I wonder if Zosima ever performed any miracle.

649
00:55:20,001 --> 00:55:26,160
I'm not sure that he does because he stays in the monastery.

650
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:30,240
And I think if you don't go out in the world, maybe you can't perform them.

651
00:55:30,401 --> 00:55:32,881
Keep your eyes open for that, too.

652
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,801
So now, let's see where we are.

653
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:45,920
Okay, now we've got something that's not normally possible for normal human beings, and that is being part of this flow of agape love.

654
00:55:46,561 --> 00:55:53,441
Like an ocean, I can talk in water metaphors, it flows into the world through Markle or Jesus.

655
00:55:54,081 --> 00:55:58,480
It flows into the world first through Jesus, and so to speak, again through Markle.

656
00:55:58,481 --> 00:56:03,920
It's sort of not only the incarnation, but a re-incarnation, you could say, with Markle.

657
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,561
The love flows into the world.

658
00:56:06,561 --> 00:56:13,280
And now the question is: how does it sort of go from person to person?

659
00:56:13,601 --> 00:56:16,641
How do they get in touch with this flow of love?

660
00:56:16,641 --> 00:56:18,800
And that gets us to the onion chain.

661
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:27,281
The onion chain is the first part of the story for him in a way, the first part of the story of how it's going to go out into the world.

662
00:56:27,441 --> 00:56:30,601
But it told in terms of a parable on 405.

663
00:56:30,601 --> 00:56:35,800
It's brilliant that Dostoevsky finds this funny story to make his point.

664
00:56:38,521 --> 00:56:40,840
Where is the onion story?

665
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,921
405.

666
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,401
Okay, I'm going to read you the whole onion story.

667
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:47,320
Now you should have the chart in front of you.

668
00:56:47,561 --> 00:56:51,801
I just turned the onion story into a chart for this book.

669
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,400
But first, I'll read the story.

670
00:56:54,041 --> 00:56:57,960
I'll read it fast because we've got not much time because you've got it in front of you.

671
00:56:57,961 --> 00:57:00,440
Once upon a time, there was a peasant woman, a wicked woman.

672
00:57:00,441 --> 00:57:02,440
She died and didn't do a single good deed.

673
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,920
The devils plunged her into a lake of fire.

674
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:11,480
So her guardian angel, everyone has a devil and a guardian angel, demagicalized.

675
00:57:11,481 --> 00:57:16,121
On both sides of it, I do it in two ways.

676
00:57:16,121 --> 00:57:22,601
But the onion chain one is what you want, which is the succession of love to Alyasha.

677
00:57:22,601 --> 00:57:26,041
Then chart two is what happens when it hits Alyasha.

678
00:57:26,041 --> 00:57:29,321
Then everybody gets into it in a different way.

679
00:57:29,481 --> 00:57:31,561
So let's, I'm reading it still.

680
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:39,081
So the guardian angel comes and wonders what good deed, and she's given away an onion, so they start pulling her out with an onion.

681
00:57:39,081 --> 00:57:42,680
And if you pull her out, God says she can come to paradise.

682
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:51,561
The angel ran to the woman and held out the onion, and he was pulling her out, but she was a very wicked woman, and she began kicking all the others.

683
00:57:51,561 --> 00:57:53,320
I'm the one to be pulled out, not you.

684
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,760
It's my onion, not yours.

685
00:57:54,760 --> 00:58:00,361
As soon as she said that, the onion broke, and she fell back into the lake, and is burning there to this day.

686
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:07,641
Well, Alyasha's the woman, but Alyasha isn't a selfish, bad woman, and he doesn't take all the people off.

687
00:58:07,641 --> 00:58:12,041
He's pulled out, and everybody else is pulled out by holding on to him.

688
00:58:12,041 --> 00:58:14,880
That's the parable version.

689
00:58:13,481 --> 00:58:18,880
Now, in the chart, you can see, chart, onion, chain one.

690
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:23,041
There's God, which is the field of connectedness.

691
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:26,721
There's Marsha, the Markle incarnates it.

692
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,320
Well, Zosima is really the onion.

693
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,440
I'm sorry, I got it wrong.

694
00:58:29,441 --> 00:58:30,561
I once realized.

695
00:58:30,561 --> 00:58:31,840
Zosima is the onion.

696
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:37,761
He's the one who is enabling Alyasha to be pulled out.

697
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,321
And Zosima pulls Alyasha out.

698
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,880
By the way, does Zosima have one S or two?

699
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,920
In our book, it has two, but everywhere in my charts, it has one.

700
00:58:45,921 --> 00:58:49,200
Is it open to two different ways of spelling?

701
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,521
Or is it just dyslexic?

702
00:58:51,521 --> 00:58:54,480
Russian consultants, how do you spell Zosima?

703
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,921
We will find out.

704
00:58:55,921 --> 00:58:57,521
So now we get to Alyasha.

705
00:58:57,601 --> 00:59:01,041
So Alyasha connects with everybody.

706
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:03,121
And you can just run through it.

707
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:06,081
I don't think you've gotten near enough the end of the book.

708
00:59:06,081 --> 00:59:10,081
How many of you have read Yvonne's encounter with the devil?

709
00:59:10,401 --> 00:59:18,561
Well, you guys know, anyway, that Alyasha comes in and saves Yvonne from going completely crazy.

710
00:59:18,561 --> 00:59:25,841
And Yvonne says, so you come in just in time, you came flying down to rescue me, and he saves him.

711
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,601
But he doesn't save him completely.

712
00:59:27,601 --> 00:59:29,200
That's why he's in brackets.

713
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,921
Yvonne is in bad shape by the end of the book.

714
00:59:31,921 --> 00:59:34,320
And he doesn't save Lisa completely.

715
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,321
She's in brackets on my chart.

716
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:43,601
He certainly counteracts the bad Yvonne influence, but he can't really help her.

717
00:59:43,601 --> 00:59:51,761
He does save Kalya, you don't know that yet, Ilusha, the boys, Dimitri, and we've seen already how he saves Grushenka.

718
00:59:51,760 --> 01:00:04,120
Now, when he saves them, now you turn over the chart, you see something that isn't in the parable of the onion, except in that one sentence, that there was a guardian angel.

719
01:00:04,441 --> 01:00:11,800
But there's not only a guardian angel, there's a devil trying to bring about the destruction of all of these people.

720
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:28,041
I once heard on the radio when I used to listen to the radio, always some, before the program I wanted, which I don't remember, there was some sort of evangelical program, and the guy ended by saying, and the devil still goes through the world, seeking to corrupt the souls of men.

721
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:30,840
And I think, gee, people still believe that.

722
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:34,920
Well, Dostoevsky believes it, but he believes it in an existentialized way.

723
01:00:34,921 --> 01:00:39,160
I don't know what the preacher on the radio meant.

724
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:43,320
There is, notice now, there's always somebody corrupting.

725
01:00:43,641 --> 01:00:49,401
You've got Markle, there's God, the ocean of love, and there's that socialist philosophy friend.

726
01:00:49,401 --> 01:01:03,320
And the socialist philosophy friend makes him say to his mother, remember God, there is many God, and I won't pray to the icons, corrupts him for a while, but God wins out in Markle.

727
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:06,841
And then Zosima, it's the army that turns him into a brute.

728
01:01:07,561 --> 01:01:13,480
And Markle wins out in Zosima when he has this sudden transformation at the duel.

729
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:29,480
And Zosima gives this love to Alyasha, and now you get all these pairs in which we saw Rakitin and Ivan corrupting Alyasha, and the angel saving Alyasha's Zosima.

730
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:34,041
And we see thus, Alyasha, saving Grushenka.

731
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:40,121
Well, we see Alyasha corrupting Grushenka and saving Grushenka.

732
01:01:40,441 --> 01:01:42,761
That's why there's so true arrows from him.

733
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:43,320
Remember?

734
01:01:43,601 --> 01:01:48,720
Because people at the bottom, below Grushenka, Alyasha is the devil one.

735
01:01:49,041 --> 01:01:55,121
It's his not looking at Grushenka, remember, that makes her humiliated and drives her to despair.

736
01:01:55,121 --> 01:01:59,601
But there's the Alyasha who looks at her with the purest interest, which saves her.

737
01:01:59,601 --> 01:02:01,920
You don't know all the fight around Dimitri yet.

738
01:02:01,921 --> 01:02:03,920
Alyasha is trying to save Dmitry.

739
01:02:03,921 --> 01:02:07,280
Ivan and Rakitin are trying to corrupt Dimitri.

740
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:11,360
Ivan is trying to, I can't even tell you what.

741
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:14,321
Rakitin is telling him about neurons.

742
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:22,081
And Dimitri says he's going to go to Siberia and become the angel for the Siberian prisoners.

743
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:26,720
Ivan, we can't say much about yet, nor Lisa.

744
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,880
You have to sort of figure it out from here on.

745
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:34,561
But the little chart at the bottom there is: the angel is always the one above, and the devil is always the one below.

746
01:02:34,561 --> 01:02:44,641
And what I want to say is the whole structure of the book is, as that chart is supposed to show, is not always the angel and devil fighting for the soul of man.

747
01:02:44,641 --> 01:02:46,641
Ooh, I just remembered.

748
01:02:46,641 --> 01:02:47,601
Look at this.

749
01:02:47,601 --> 01:02:49,841
Remember what Dimitri says?

750
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:58,241
Dimitri says, 121, God and the devil are fighting there, meaning the soul of man.

751
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:02,481
God and the devil are fighting there, and the battlefield is the heart of man.

752
01:03:02,481 --> 01:03:08,961
That's the heart, that's what this is about, the battlefield for the heart of each person.

753
01:03:08,961 --> 01:03:10,320
Now let's see where we are.

754
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,481
We still have time, which is good.

755
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:13,840
I want to see.

756
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,761
So there's the onion story.

757
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,801
Looks, I have to go back now and it jumped ahead.

758
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:19,680
Ah, look at that.

759
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,481
I was just going to cite the Dimitri thing.

760
01:03:22,481 --> 01:03:24,561
So let's just review again.

761
01:03:24,561 --> 01:03:26,321
And what does the angel do?

762
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,360
It always loves the person.

763
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:30,840
It's usually Alyasha, always in this book.

764
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,521
I guess the angel is Alyasha.

765
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:33,721
Loves the other person.

766
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:41,240
And by giving them this kind of confidence, he gets them over their humiliation.

767
01:03:41,240 --> 01:04:01,001
People are always humiliating other people, in Dostoevsky, and then that makes them able to love themselves and to love others and to come out of the selfish world, the hell of isolation, to talk like the mysterious visitor into the world of love.

768
01:04:01,001 --> 01:04:03,881
And Dimitri sees all that.

769
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:12,121
Another way to put it, the angel is always there, sort of affirming the good side of the self when you think about it in the two books.

770
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:17,560
If you think about it as having lackey, and what's the other side?

771
01:04:21,081 --> 01:04:26,521
What is Ivan the view that they're either lackey or lofty?

772
01:04:26,521 --> 01:04:27,400
That's it, yeah.

773
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:43,721
Anyway, so insofar as there is a good and a bad side to the self, which is very tricky because depending on how you define it, but if you've got a good and bad side, your view of the self, then you really have a good and bad side because you're the self that you've got a view of.

774
01:04:43,961 --> 01:05:00,120
Then the angel, whether the devil tries to bring out the lackey side and the angel tries to bring out the lofty side, or whatever it is that's leading you to despair and to give up on love and give up on your fellow human beings, that the devil reinforces that.

775
01:05:00,281 --> 01:05:05,481
Saw that with Rakitin when he was despairing because of Zasima.

776
01:05:05,481 --> 01:05:16,960
And when you see it with Grushenka, when Rakitin brings Alyasha to Grushenka to bring out the worst in her to get her to seduce Alyasha.

777
01:05:17,281 --> 01:05:26,481
And the other side is always trying, the angel is always trying to bring out the good side and reinforce the person and save them from despair.

778
01:05:26,481 --> 01:05:28,880
And that's what the chart is about.

779
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:36,160
And Alyasha does it to everybody in the book except Lisa and Yvonne.

780
01:05:36,161 --> 01:05:39,280
And maybe he'll do it later with Lisa because he's going to marry her.

781
01:05:39,281 --> 01:05:44,880
And there's one sentence that says that Yvonne lived to become a nice person.

782
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,080
I think I cited it once.

783
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,200
You'll see it when you go by.

784
01:05:47,201 --> 01:05:51,680
It says, years later, Yvonne considered the moment when he was down.

785
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,521
Blow everybody's mind.

786
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:03,920
When he sees, okay, when he, so, so Yvonne will be saved too.

787
01:06:04,481 --> 01:06:06,160
There are people who won't be saved.

788
01:06:06,161 --> 01:06:07,920
And I think I just want to mention it now.

789
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:13,840
On my chart, there are no angels and devils fighting for two people.

790
01:06:14,161 --> 01:06:18,080
And one of them is Rakitin, because he's not a person.

791
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:22,321
He's only got this ambition to see the fall of everybody.

792
01:06:22,321 --> 01:06:24,720
He is a demythologized devil.

793
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:30,401
And who's the other person, sort of semi-person, that Alyasha doesn't try to save?

794
01:06:30,401 --> 01:06:33,120
And nobody's fighting over the solo.

795
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:36,481
It's Merzhikov, because he's no person at all.

796
01:06:36,481 --> 01:06:37,601
He's got no self.

797
01:06:37,601 --> 01:06:43,361
He lost his self when he was told that he grew from the mildew in the bathhouse, which he never remembered.

798
01:06:43,361 --> 01:06:44,160
Remember all that?

799
01:06:44,161 --> 01:07:01,240
So it's important then, that you really have to be sort of pathological or kind of physiological to be outside of this self that has these two sides and having the, what's it's the Madonna and Sodom sides.

800
01:07:01,241 --> 01:07:11,800
I just want to remind you of them in which there's always a side that the angel needs to sort of support and the other side the devil needs to bring down.

801
01:07:13,241 --> 01:07:15,401
I have to say something here that I skipped somewhere.

802
01:07:15,401 --> 01:07:18,840
I don't know where I should have put it, but maybe I should put it right here.

803
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:21,160
Maybe I do put it right here.

804
01:07:21,161 --> 01:07:22,601
Let me look.

805
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,080
Probably.

806
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:29,000
So I'm just thinking about Lisa.

807
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:36,361
What happens with Lisa is when, you know, she is sadomasochistic.

808
01:07:36,361 --> 01:07:39,320
She slams the door on her finger and watches the blood.

809
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:45,641
She dreams of seeing the child crucified and eating compote while watching it.

810
01:07:45,641 --> 01:07:56,040
She plays this game of dreaming of the devils coming at her while she's in her bed and then just at the last minute making the sign of the cross and chasing them away.

811
01:07:56,040 --> 01:08:00,360
And what's interesting is, here it's 674.

812
01:08:00,361 --> 01:08:02,360
Can Alyasha help her?

813
01:08:02,361 --> 01:08:04,360
What's her problem?

814
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:07,080
This is all very strange stuff.

815
01:08:07,641 --> 01:08:16,280
And on the top 674, is Alyasha still a monk or does she just think he's a monk at this point?

816
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,040
I don't know.

817
01:08:19,241 --> 01:08:21,160
You're a monk, she says.

818
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:24,680
He's talking about how everybody wants to kill their father.

819
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,920
This is the part Freud liked a lot.

820
01:08:27,241 --> 01:08:30,200
But that's not what we want to talk about here.

821
01:08:30,361 --> 01:08:33,160
What we want to talk about is she says, I had a funny dream.

822
01:08:33,161 --> 01:08:34,601
I dreamt of devils.

823
01:08:34,601 --> 01:08:44,080
It's night, and I'm in my room with a candle, and the devils come and they want to grab me, and they're just about to grab me, and I make the sign of a cross, and they draw back, but they don't go away.

824
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:48,960
They stand in the corner waiting, and suddenly I have a frightful longing to revile God aloud.

825
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:53,200
And so I begin, and then they come crowding back to me, delighted, and grab me again.

826
01:08:53,201 --> 01:08:54,720
And I cross myself again.

827
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:55,840
It's awful fun.

828
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,601
It takes one's breath away.

829
01:08:57,601 --> 01:09:01,120
And that's already amazing, weird Dostoevsky.

830
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,280
But the next line is even more amazing.

831
01:09:03,441 --> 01:09:13,200
First, let's ask: I mean, what's the dark side of Alyasha that would enable him to understand and help Lisa?

832
01:09:13,521 --> 01:09:19,680
And the answer to everybody's amazement, at least mine, is Alyasha says, I've had that dream too.

833
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:20,080
What?

834
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,840
Reviling God and playing with the devils?

835
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:24,240
Really?

836
01:09:24,241 --> 01:09:25,441
cried Lisa, surprised.

837
01:09:25,441 --> 01:09:26,641
Alyasha, don't laugh.

838
01:09:26,641 --> 01:09:27,601
It's awfully important.

839
01:09:27,601 --> 01:09:29,441
Did two people have the same dream?

840
01:09:29,441 --> 01:09:30,800
It seems they can.

841
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,160
Alyasha, I tell you, it's awfully important, Lisa went on in amazement.

842
01:09:34,161 --> 01:09:38,400
It's not the dream that's important, it's having the same dream and so forth.

843
01:09:38,401 --> 01:09:49,680
So it's very important that he has this dark side which enables him to empathize with her and help her.

844
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:55,200
So even to be an angel, remember to be able to save anybody, you've got to have a dark side.

845
01:09:55,201 --> 01:09:59,760
And we know Sauson was in the army, and we know the mysterious visitor was a murderer.

846
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,680
We know what else.

847
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:07,680
We know what, but there's another one, too, right?

848
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,680
One of the saving people.

849
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:12,160
Anyway, so, yeah.

850
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,200
What about Jesus?

851
01:10:15,201 --> 01:10:16,720
Ah, well, that's there.

852
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:19,441
We have to have another course and read The Idiot.

853
01:10:19,441 --> 01:10:21,360
The Idiot is about Jesus.

854
01:10:21,361 --> 01:10:24,960
And as I read The Idiot, nobody else reads it this way that I know of.

855
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,720
The idiot is supposed to be Jesus.

856
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:36,120
And after The Idiot's been in the world and been relating to people for a while, he drives one of them to suicide, and another one goes crazy.

857
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:38,680
He creates a complete mess, the idiot.

858
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:41,160
And that's because he's perfectly good.

859
01:10:41,161 --> 01:10:42,840
He has no dark side.

860
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:48,200
Now, so Dostoevsky thinks Jesus must have a dark side, and we just don't know about it.

861
01:10:48,441 --> 01:10:52,040
And that Alyasha has this dark side is really mysterious.

862
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:56,920
If anybody could cast a lot of light on it, they should write a paper about it.

863
01:10:57,561 --> 01:11:05,720
I think, when you ask yourself, what makes Lisa a spiritual double of Alyasha?

864
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:16,120
And it seems, this is just my first guess, but some of you will understand this better than me just because you can sort of try and see how far I got and maybe go further.

865
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:23,960
I mean, I think that they both, remember, Alyasha can't stand hearing the dirty words that his schoolmates shout in his ears.

866
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:26,521
He hasn't integrated his sensuality.

867
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,040
That's why he came.

868
01:11:28,281 --> 01:11:33,080
It's beginning to be integrated because he can look at Grushenka now without getting upset.

869
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:40,200
But in general, Alyasha's sort of earthy side is very undeveloped and unintegrated.

870
01:11:40,201 --> 01:11:43,000
And Lisa must have the same thing.

871
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,880
She has these very dangerous desires.

872
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:50,680
She desires that Ivan come and beat her up or rape her or something, and he doesn't.

873
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:59,080
And then Alyasha said, she says, I don't want to go find the passage, but she says, I wanted him to, and then the thing goes dot, dot, dot.

874
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:02,840
I mean, what you couldn't write probably in Russia at that time.

875
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:11,800
But it's clear that she wanted him to do something to her qua-masochist and him asatus, because Alyasha said afterwards, he did an honorable thing.

876
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:12,840
He just left.

877
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,321
He didn't take advantage of her.

878
01:12:14,641 --> 01:12:28,880
But anyway, so all I can think of is that Alyasha and Lisa have some big deal problem with their sensuality, which they misunderstand, this is the crucial part, as some devilish part of themselves.

879
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:35,920
And as long as they do and sort of play with it that way, they are not going to be able to integrate it.

880
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:41,920
And of course, somehow, some way, probably the way they love each other, they're going to have to be able to do that.

881
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:48,481
I just find that an interesting sort of loose end that must have been for the second volume that we can only make up.

882
01:12:48,481 --> 01:12:49,840
We've got another minute to make it up.

883
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,120
You want to go ahead.

884
01:12:58,321 --> 01:12:59,601
He's already given it up.

885
01:12:59,601 --> 01:13:00,240
That's interesting.

886
01:13:00,241 --> 01:13:00,720
Let's look.

887
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,000
What tense does he say?

888
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,561
I have that dream or I've had that dream.

889
01:13:04,561 --> 01:13:06,320
It's interesting to look.

890
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:10,080
He says, I had the same dream too.

891
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,360
Uh-huh.

892
01:13:11,361 --> 01:13:12,321
So, okay.

893
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:18,000
We can believe that maybe he's made more progress at getting out of it.

894
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,561
We haven't seen, and one of them maybe is the relation to Grushenka.

895
01:13:22,561 --> 01:13:31,601
He's seen that he doesn't have to look at women with lustfulness, but his agape sort of trumps that.

896
01:13:31,601 --> 01:13:40,240
And maybe then he's already got that in his past, so he can help Lisa somehow learn to put it in her past.

897
01:13:40,561 --> 01:13:41,760
That's what you're thinking.

898
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,040
Is that right?

899
01:13:44,161 --> 01:13:47,760
Yeah, that was there in the Rakitan thing, but he overcame it.

900
01:13:48,481 --> 01:13:49,280
I agree with you.

901
01:13:49,281 --> 01:13:51,521
He doesn't have that dream anymore, probably.

902
01:13:51,521 --> 01:13:53,280
But I'm back to what I was saying.

903
01:13:53,281 --> 01:13:59,401
He just hasn't finished the job of explaining how he's going to deal with Lisa.

904
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:01,080
But one thing is fascinating.

905
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:05,481
Try to figure out what it is that makes them existential doubles.

906
01:14:05,481 --> 01:14:09,880
And it's got something to do with not integrating the dark side.

907
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,000
That's all I had.

908
01:14:11,241 --> 01:14:15,880
But start playing with integrating the dark side and then not integrating it and then doing it.

909
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:17,080
Let's stop with that.

910
01:14:17,641 --> 01:14:19,960
We'll go on to the next issue next time.
