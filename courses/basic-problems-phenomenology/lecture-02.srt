1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,561
I'm ready to plunge back into the fascinating issues around the guilt.

2
00:00:07,601 --> 00:00:17,920
I've got the syllabus in front of me just to remind myself and you that today we're supposed to be doing guilt and resoluteness, and we will.

3
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:41,520
And next time we're going to be doing death, and that's such a complicated, long, messy, confused chapter that I will put on the website for the course, a long, and I hope not confused, but I'm not sure, paper I wrote about it as an introduction to a book on Heidegger on death.

4
00:00:41,841 --> 00:01:13,721
The important thing isn't, I mean, it begins explaining where it sits in the book, but the important thing is that this book written by a former PA, former PhD in this department, and PA in the Heidegger course, he has this fascinating idea of looking at what Heidegger means by death all through his whole career of writing and reading what he said in the earlier discussion of death, what he ended up saying about death.

5
00:01:13,721 --> 00:01:20,281
That seems like an unsort of unfair and unreliable or something hermeneutic approach.

6
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:35,881
But I think Heidegger would have loved it because Heidegger was constantly reading back and reinterpreting being in time as saying what he was later saying, and which is pretty clearly not what he's saying in being in time, but it was.

7
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,240
I think he would say what he's trying to say is unthought, and he gets it clearer as he goes along.

8
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,481
So that's for next time.

9
00:01:43,481 --> 00:01:47,161
I'll put it on the web tonight or tomorrow.

10
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:59,080
And so for this time, we've got Scott Rooster's paper, and we've got the chapter in Being in Time on guilt and resoluteness.

11
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:11,961
And I think I'll talk a while, sort of laying out what I think are the important issues and the important pages, and then we should, we'll have a discussion.

12
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:14,841
I'm just not sure whether we should have a discussion any time.

13
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:16,680
I think Tyler wants to say something.

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,921
It's really for this time, because, I mean, it's about the punchline of the paper.

15
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:27,161
And then let me explain why the paper's there.

16
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:32,800
I think it's a terrific paper, the punchline of which is you can't get behind your throwness.

17
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,240
And that's exactly what primordial ontological guilt is.

18
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,520
It's the fact that Dasein can't get behind its throwness.

19
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,721
But it's one, it's not obvious what in the world fact that is, what it means to say that.

20
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:54,240
And secondly, it's not at all obvious what the argument is supposed to be that shows that you can't get behind your throwness.

21
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,881
And why, Tyler, does it matter?

22
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,921
Yes, my paper, too.

23
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:01,520
Sorry, I'm glad you said that.

24
00:03:01,521 --> 00:03:02,481
There's an ambiguity.

25
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,880
Believe it and I have written two papers.

26
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:10,800
One of them was for today or last time.

27
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,041
It's sort of in between.

28
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:16,881
It's the paper on an everyday intelligibility issue.

29
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:23,520
But what I wanted you to see in it, and what I didn't want to spend a lot of time in class sort of just going over, was the skill story.

30
00:03:23,521 --> 00:03:33,440
But the idea of what expertise and mastery is, the phenomenon of that, is going to play a big role in our, well, a middle-sized program, in what I want to say.

31
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:46,080
So there was last time my paper on, and also that paper, I didn't look at it with this question in mind.

32
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,800
That already does guilt before death, doesn't it?

33
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:50,481
I'm sure it does.

34
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,320
I mean, that's part of one of the reasons I wanted you.

35
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:59,680
I already reordered the, remember last time, a real quick review from last time.

36
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:05,120
Remember, I decided that you've got to do birth before death.

37
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,521
You've got to do the past before the future.

38
00:04:07,521 --> 00:04:14,841
You've got to do the facticity before the interpretation or the projection on the basis of that facticity.

39
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:18,360
For all those reasons, you've got to do guilt before death.

40
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,721
And Heidegger just got it mixed up, don't ask me why.

41
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:32,520
And when you do it that way, you will discover, and we get our first sort of reward for doing it that way, that we can distinguish anticipation.

42
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:33,800
Sorry, let's talk the other way.

43
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,440
We can distinguish resoluteness from anticipatory resoluteness.

44
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:58,841
And you can see how resoluteness, which is always tied with guilt, and only resoluteness, not anticipatory resoluteness, is a less radical understanding of the fundamentally ungrounded character of Dasein than anticipatory resoluteness, which goes with death.

45
00:04:59,161 --> 00:05:00,680
That is in my paper, isn't it?

46
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,161
I hope so.

47
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:02,680
Okay.

48
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,041
So that's why it's in there.

49
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:08,841
It's also an argument for the phenomena of expertise, which I think is important.

50
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:15,961
And maybe it's even more important, it's an argument for what I just said, why you want to do it that way.

51
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:23,320
Remember, it's another way to put it is why you want to go do Irose before you do Augustblich.

52
00:05:24,601 --> 00:05:27,161
Or there was another way I was going to put it.

53
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:35,641
Well, I say to myself, you've got to do the Aristotelian phonemist before you can do Jesus and the God-man.

54
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,201
They're all versions of the same one thing presupposed.

55
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,680
What presupposes what.

56
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,880
So anyway, thanks, Tyler.

57
00:05:43,881 --> 00:05:46,841
Yes, that was why that paper was in there.

58
00:05:46,841 --> 00:05:54,201
And I see now that I put the Ruth paper there in the first introduction.

59
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,680
That's what I thought I was going to get further in the discussion when we got.

60
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:07,520
But it really belongs with the Guild paper, but I wanted you to read it before we got to the Guild discussion, which in the end you have, presumably.

61
00:06:08,161 --> 00:06:17,440
And now the paper, what I'm going to give you to read before the next meeting, is my version of the death chapter.

62
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,961
And then we'll be ready for anticipatory resolution in the meeting after that.

63
00:06:23,281 --> 00:06:27,921
Any questions about all that or sort of take the way of it?

64
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,360
Then we can go into what I think we could be going into.

65
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,921
And I think it maybe tape about half an hour to say all the things I want to say, and then we can discuss them.

66
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:54,161
But I was just, when Tyler raised his hand, I was just asking myself: do I want to sort of stop and discuss these issues as they come along, or read this until for half an hour or something, and then discuss?

67
00:06:54,161 --> 00:06:55,841
I'm really puzzled.

68
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:59,360
I'm puzzled because this is sort of a class and sort of a seminar.

69
00:07:00,401 --> 00:07:09,760
It's got the number of hours and units of a class, but I originally had it as a seminar, and I think of it as something we're all trying to figure this out together.

70
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:21,761
It was sort of true that I think I already have figured out the first three weeks, maybe even the first four weeks, but from there on, I'm the blind leading the blind into temporality.

71
00:07:21,761 --> 00:07:26,001
So I think I'll start reading it.

72
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:40,640
But if you think you really got something important to say, such that if we don't talk about that right away, we're going to be off the track, or you aren't going to understand what's going on, or I'm going to be misleading everybody, then interrupt.

73
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:45,641
I mean, let's have some middle ground, sort of be a kind of chronomus of interruption.

74
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,681
When it's appropriate, do it.

75
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:55,241
Okay, now, as usual, I wish I had a collector, and there just wasn't one, is there?

76
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:55,881
Okay.

77
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:01,161
I think I can get along with putting things on my GPS.

78
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:14,601
I mean, it's good to go maybe after class and try to still want to keep it in here, but it's not a good idea to go marching into some professor's collector and take the chronomus out, take the lecture out from under his nose.

79
00:08:15,881 --> 00:08:30,441
Okay, so I want to talk about the phenomenon and get in the air sort of for what view of action Heidegger is presenting in this chapter.

80
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:35,320
Guilt is always sort of the basis of it.

81
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:45,560
That is something about the fundamental ungroundedness of Dasein, something about the fact that it can't get behind its throne is where we're heading.

82
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:58,681
But to begin with, I think you need an understanding of how the resolute Dasein acts, the description of the highest, almost highest level of action.

83
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:08,281
And as far as it being a story about acting, it is the highest in the sense that you can't get any more mastery than this.

84
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,560
You may get something else.

85
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,921
I don't want to be secretive.

86
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:18,761
I mean, this gets you up to the highest level of skill, namely mastery, as I understand it.

87
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:26,521
Remember that resolute action responds to the unique situation, not to the general situation.

88
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:28,841
That's what I'm trying to explain.

89
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:35,840
But there's something higher than mastery, even, and that is being a world disclosure.

90
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,080
That's not, so to speak, more skillful than mastery.

91
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,561
It's just something more radical than mastery.

92
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,761
And that's what the death chapter and anticipatory resoluteness is about.

93
00:09:50,080 --> 00:10:04,800
So now I'm just trying to explain why I'm going to talk a little while about my view of mastery, Bourbieu's view of the cultural virtuoso, the Aristotelian eponymous, and Heidegger's resolute design.

94
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:22,241
And I'm, I'm saying things new to me this time because I'm constantly learning more about the Bourdieu and Rarnacus, and seeing that there are all kinds of distinctions I haven't been making yet.

95
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,241
So the first thing is, how do you get to be a master?

96
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:38,641
Well, that ties up with the anxiety of guilt and the nullity that it reveals.

97
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:44,001
I have this tendency to want to say all these things at once, but I'll try not to.

98
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,840
The anxiety, there are three kinds of nullity.

99
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:56,000
Now, these are things I want to sort of say to get the architectonic in mind, because it's not very clear in the version of.

100
00:10:56,001 --> 00:10:58,081
But there are three kinds of nullity.

101
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:05,041
There's the nullity of the ungroundedness, which is the one that guilt is going to tell us about.

102
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:17,161
There's the nullity of choice, which is what Garre writes the whole almost, I get the whole being in nothingness about, and Heidegger thinks it's so uninteresting that it's reading on one page of Division II.

103
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:24,121
And then there's the nullity of what is it?

104
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,401
The possibility of having no more possibilities.

105
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:32,440
That's the death nullity.

106
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:39,081
And each of those has an anxiety, an anxiety of guilt, an anxiety of choice, an anxiety that goes with death.

107
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:50,361
And we're starting by looking at the way the anxiety of guilt plays some kind of role in becoming autonomous.

108
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:55,560
And I don't think Heidegger ever explains that very well.

109
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:07,881
I want to take it to mean that the anxiety of guilt is the anxiety that there are no grounding principles on which you can act.

110
00:12:07,881 --> 00:12:26,361
Neither the principles of the one, that is the general rules about how people do things, or rational principles, or cognitivist principles that are the structure of your acting, even if you don't know it.

111
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,961
There aren't any such.

112
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,401
And that's what's revealed in this anxiety of guilt.

113
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:40,361
Why is that important for becoming the kind of mastery, having a mastery of resoluteness?

114
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:54,521
Well, that's tied up in the whole story of how to skill acquisition, where you start out with rules and principles as a novice, and you get even then you get maxims, remember, as an advanced beginner.

115
00:12:54,521 --> 00:13:16,001
But when you get up to, but when you get finally up to expert, you don't have any rules and principles, you just straightway do the appropriate thing at the appropriate time in the appropriate way, whether it's driving or chess playing or doing actions, or you're doing good actions in your culture.

116
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:33,200
The idea in here is that the anxiety you have to, if you hang on to the principles, if every time you make a mistake, you try to find a rule that will tell you not to make that mistake again, you'll be stuck as competent.

117
00:13:33,200 --> 00:14:05,521
But if you're living in a kind of experience of that all of this way that one does things and rules for doing things and standards for doing things don't have any grip on you, and that's what happens in anxiety, you see that they're all ungrounded and have no force in determining your actions, or could have no force, well, have no force when you're an expert.

118
00:14:05,521 --> 00:14:07,201
And how do you get to be an expert?

119
00:14:07,361 --> 00:14:09,360
You just see that they have no force.

120
00:14:09,361 --> 00:14:11,841
There's no place for a should-have-no force in them.

121
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:22,080
So when you're in anxiety, you see that the principles don't have any power over you, and you can't use them to ground what you're doing.

122
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:32,521
And you have to see that if you're going to acquire mastery, if you're going to stop trying to explain what you're doing, I mean, I could give you an example.

123
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:37,921
That a lot of this comes from my brother, as you know, but I give him credit as usual.

124
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:49,480
So George has the example, and this is just any old example that they'll do, that how he gets stuck in incompetence and how not to get stuck in competence.

125
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,840
I talk about it in the paper, but not this example.

126
00:14:53,161 --> 00:14:54,761
Maybe I do, I can't remember.

127
00:14:54,761 --> 00:15:12,041
But if I mean, the example was if you're a driver and if you're coming out of a parking place, you get sideswiped by a car, and then you can either just feel bad about it and remember vividly what happened, or you can try to make a new rule for yourself.

128
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:16,281
Never pull out of a parking place without looking back.

129
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:20,281
And that will keep you from getting sideswiped as you pull out of parking places.

130
00:15:20,281 --> 00:15:23,161
It's a very rigid, general solution.

131
00:15:23,401 --> 00:15:31,241
At midnight on an empty street, it makes no sense to carefully look back before you pull out.

132
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:33,720
But that may not be a perfect example.

133
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,761
Well, it will do.

134
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:45,481
That shows that you can give yourself a new rule and you will indeed be able to avoid some bad thing that you did, but you will never get to the kind of flexibility.

135
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,720
Again, what do you and I do, presumably, who are all expert drivers?

136
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,521
Well, we look back when it's appropriate to look back.

137
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:59,080
And we've been looking back all the time in the rearview mirror, so we don't have to look back just before we pull out of the parking place.

138
00:15:59,081 --> 00:16:03,480
And if it's late at night, then there are no cars, you can't be sideswiped, and so forth.

139
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:10,281
All of that leads you to, again, just straightway do the appropriate thing at the appropriate time, in the appropriate way.

140
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:15,000
In this case, sometimes that means looking in the rearview mirror, and sometimes it doesn't.

141
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:30,881
And the role of anxiety is in here again, is you would have given up belief that there was any rule that was going to tell you correctly in all situations what to do driving.

142
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:42,000
And that's and that's the way I think that resolution, that anxiety, one way anyway, that anxiety plays a role in becoming a master.

143
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:52,081
Namely, you don't go around believing in, making principles for how you behave, discovering when you make mistakes, try to figure out what you did.

144
00:16:52,720 --> 00:17:16,080
On this story about skill acquisition, you remain open, you worry about what you did, you think of, you feel bad about it, or if it's something good, which equal could happen in some other example, you feel good about it, and if you do it enough and feel bad about it enough and good about it enough, your brain just gets wired in such a way that you do the appropriate thing.

145
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:22,881
That's my skill Victor, and I think that's Heidegger's skill Victor will come out as we go.

146
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:25,760
Now let me read a few pages.

147
00:17:26,081 --> 00:17:27,601
Is everything okay with that?

148
00:17:27,601 --> 00:17:30,401
You're looking a little, I don't know, puzzled.

149
00:17:30,401 --> 00:17:31,921
So let's read something.

150
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,040
I say to read, well, I'm going to be on 342 for a while.

151
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:42,881
Now, anxiety undermines the one and its standards and principles.

152
00:17:42,881 --> 00:17:51,921
So 342, the fact of the anxiety of conscience, remember, of course, conscience isn't going to mean anything like conscience.

153
00:17:51,921 --> 00:17:57,121
So we have the whole, which provides you the whole formal indication story in the background.

154
00:17:57,121 --> 00:18:13,841
Anything that anybody normally says about conscience is going to turn out to be a cover-up and somehow an 180-degree wrong cover-up, which exactly denies the phenomenon so that you're not upset by it.

155
00:18:14,841 --> 00:18:28,280
So, conscience, which my one might think is gives us rules, tells us what God wants us to do, or tells us what follows from the categorical imperative or whatever.

156
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:42,921
All of that kind of conscience is a cover-up for what's really happening with conscience is the experience that there are no standards and rules, no grounded standards and rules that you have to follow.

157
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,361
You can follow them sometimes.

158
00:18:44,361 --> 00:18:55,801
So, the fact that anxiety of conscience gives us phenomenal confirmation that in understanding the call, Dasein is brought face to face with its own uncanniness.

159
00:18:55,881 --> 00:19:05,401
I always like to translate that unsettledness, but the Unheimlich type in German, it has to do with the ungroundedness.

160
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,800
Wanting to have a conscience becomes the readiness for anxiety.

161
00:19:09,801 --> 00:19:16,680
That's just, to use a refinement term, on 143 at the top.

162
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,200
Only in keeping silent is the conscience call.

163
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:32,280
That is to say, the call comes from the soundlessness of the uncanniness and the Dasein, which is summons back, called back into the stillness of itself and called back to something that is to become still.

164
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,680
Only in reticence, that's the silence.

165
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,401
Therefore, is the silent discourse understood appropriately.

166
00:19:39,401 --> 00:19:46,200
In wanting to have a conscience, it breaks the words away from the common sense idle talk of the they.

167
00:19:46,200 --> 00:20:10,720
So anxiety, wanting to have a conscience that is wanting to be open to and experiencing anxiety, which is wanting to be open to and experiencing the groundlessness of Addis vote masterful, is what is what resoluteness amounts to.

168
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,561
Now, so let me read one more thing.

169
00:20:12,641 --> 00:20:16,320
What he defines resoluteness, was this the first or the second place?

170
00:20:16,321 --> 00:20:18,320
One of the sounds, I didn't look back.

171
00:20:18,321 --> 00:20:30,240
One of the evidences of this in unfinished manuscript is, I remember he defines resoluteness twice and puts it in italics like a good definer could the first time he introduces it.

172
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:36,881
I don't remember if this is the first or second, but here's one: the middle of 343.

173
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:50,960
The disclosures of Dasein and wanting to have a conscience responsible by anxiety as state of mind, by understanding his projection of oneself upon one's almost being guilty, and by discourse as reticence.

174
00:20:50,960 --> 00:21:06,240
This distinctive and authentic disclosedness, which was attested in Dasein itself by his conscience, this reticent self-projection upon one's almost being guilty, in which one is ready for anxiety, we call resoluteness.

175
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,841
And that's got to do, of course, with being authentic.

176
00:21:09,841 --> 00:21:14,721
Authentic Dasein lives in resoluteness, and that's in the next paragraph.

177
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:21,280
In resoluteness, we've now arrived at that truth of Dasein, which is most primordial, because it is authentic.

178
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:40,641
Now, with that general story about how anxiety comes in to make possible mastery, which is not something Aristotle is interested in, I think, although I think it's what he would say if you pressed him.

179
00:21:40,641 --> 00:21:43,080
Did I say Aristotle, or did I say Heidegger?

180
00:21:44,121 --> 00:21:45,081
I mean Heidegger.

181
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:49,000
I mean, Aristotle too, but I was meaning Heidegger.

182
00:21:49,480 --> 00:22:11,800
But now I want to say once you're inside the mastery business, because you've done it the way I was just describing it, holding on to anxiety and listening to the silence of conscience, you can see that there are several different times, none of them getting it when I was all right until we get to Heidegger.

183
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:20,121
So I used to think that Heidegger got it all right when he talked about the Aristotelian phronomus.

184
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:26,600
But interestingly enough, he doesn't talk about the phronomus at the point where he gets it right.

185
00:22:26,841 --> 00:22:33,800
Anyway, but he does talk a lot about pharnacus in his Sophist lectures leading up to being in time.

186
00:22:33,801 --> 00:22:38,200
And there's something right about it.

187
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:46,440
The frontimus goes, it is even somehow better than an expert.

188
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:53,401
An expert already, it seems, responds to the unique situation.

189
00:22:54,601 --> 00:22:59,240
I want to say everything at once, and then I want to, so I don't want to jump ahead, though.

190
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,800
I should probably wait till we get there.

191
00:23:01,801 --> 00:23:10,360
On 346, that's where Aristotle's pharnacus comes near the surface of the thing, though.

192
00:23:10,361 --> 00:23:24,921
Heidegger, I think, rightly doesn't quite be used to Aristotle, but he talks about on 346 responding to the unique situation underlined in italics at the end of the top, just because it's it the situation.

193
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:35,040
It's the concrete situation, and you can point it's distinguished from the general situation at the bottom of 346.

194
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:43,041
The one, however, the situation is something that has been closed off, the one knows only the general situation, and so forth.

195
00:23:44,641 --> 00:23:57,280
So, well, Heidegger thinks that the phonemist responds to the unique situation, all right, but there's two things that make it different than Aristotle, which isn't in my paper because I hadn't understood it yet.

196
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:05,520
One is, and this I sort of I think must have dimly understood already, I'm not sure, but it doesn't matter.

197
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:29,760
One way the pharnist is different than very importantly different than the resolute design is that the phronymist in Heidegger does the does what he does when he's behaving like an oh now let me back up.

198
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,401
Why the phronomist is more than an expert?

199
00:24:32,401 --> 00:24:35,361
An expert already responds to the unique situation.

200
00:24:36,081 --> 00:24:48,560
Whether you're playing chess or driving or just finding their way around to the world in flow, going out to go out when they go out the door, then they're already an expert.

201
00:24:49,361 --> 00:25:10,241
But when they're responding to the unique situation, fine, but Aristotle adds something that Heidegger doesn't have, doesn't want, I don't think, namely, that the phronymist does what the pharmaceuticals does for the sake of the good in either, in general, I think, for the sake of the good in the culture.

202
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,641
You can all who know more about Aristotle, correct me on this if I've got it wrong.

203
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:23,960
And also, and this is something Aleister McIntyre talked a lot about, that the phronomist gets to be a master at some practice.

204
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:29,480
And the phronomist does their practice for the sake of the internal goods of the practice.

205
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:46,360
So doctors are phronomi, when they use their medicine to cure people, that they could be very, very good at understanding poison, for instance, and use their medical knowledge to poison people and do it in a unique situation in just the appropriate time and just the appropriate way.

206
00:25:46,361 --> 00:25:50,440
That would not be furnaces, I believe.

207
00:25:50,760 --> 00:26:13,240
And I think Heidegger doesn't want, and it wouldn't be an experience of anxiety of this right sort then, because there would be something like a grounded or at least seemingly grounded understanding of the good of the practice and the good of the culture in the background of the moods of the phronomists.

208
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:18,440
And I think Heidegger doesn't mention Aristotle and Furnaces here because he doesn't want that.

209
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:28,760
He wants the authentically resolute design just does the appropriate thing.

210
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:34,121
But the appropriate thing, I don't think it's the same as the good thing for Heidegger.

211
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,401
Now, for Aristotle, it is.

212
00:26:37,401 --> 00:26:46,601
And Aristotle's got a distinction, therefore, that Heidegger doesn't have between cleverness and Pharnaces.

213
00:26:46,601 --> 00:26:58,360
Cleverness is what happens when you have expertise and do something that really works, and everybody recognizes who something that really works.

214
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:09,440
Somewhere I have written down some, I don't know where I put it, but for those of you who know the Athenian context, oh, here it is.

215
00:27:10,881 --> 00:27:17,200
Alcibiades was not a pharmaceutical, I take it, but he was extremely good at everything.

216
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:24,720
And he was a terrific traitor, such a good traitor that he could go off from Athens to Sparta and give them all the secret information.

217
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:33,840
And then come back to Athens, and everybody was so glad he was back and embraced him because he was so charming and so beautiful and so smart and so clever.

218
00:27:33,841 --> 00:27:39,840
I think, I don't know what the Greek is, but Aristotle has a category for people who are clever.

219
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:41,921
And they do the good, I think.

220
00:27:41,921 --> 00:27:47,200
I mean, they do the skillfully appropriate thing, that is the thing that works.

221
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,121
And they do it for their own good, not for the sake of the good.

222
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:55,760
And now I realize something that I have got wrong.

223
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,320
Partly, I'm teaching myself something new and trying to keep you from making a mistake.

224
00:28:00,321 --> 00:28:05,361
I think Bourdieu's alto vertical, which I talked about last time.

225
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,720
I don't think I read last time the passage.

226
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:15,520
I'm not sure I could just turn to it, but I marked it, so I thought I could do it.

227
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:19,360
So there's got all these different purple markings.

228
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,001
Not going to be in there.

229
00:28:22,321 --> 00:28:23,601
Anybody know where it is?

230
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:26,881
There's a place where I just decided to quote.

231
00:28:26,881 --> 00:28:34,080
I think in Spillmodel, by the way, I'm passing in.

232
00:28:34,081 --> 00:28:43,440
By the way, if we all print this in PDF, this paper that I sent of mine, for instance, or Rouse's two, do we all have the same page numbers?

233
00:28:44,121 --> 00:29:07,240
If you have my paper on page five, there's this quote about the pharmaceutical, which I think is from early Heidegger, which shows that the farm, he says the furnace responds to the unique situation, but he doesn't bring in the the business of for the sake of the good.

234
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,240
He says the pharmaceut is determined by his situation in the largest sense.

235
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:16,601
The circumstances, the givens, the time the times and the people vary.

236
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:18,680
The meaning of the action varies as well.

237
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:26,760
It's precisely the achievement of Fernacus who disclose the individual acting now in the full situation in which he acts.

238
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:39,720
And I think that captures the part of Bernices that Heidegger wants and leaves out the part of the Berneseus that Heidegger doesn't want, it's part about the good.

239
00:29:39,881 --> 00:29:42,280
Where's the cultural virtuoso?

240
00:29:42,601 --> 00:29:48,760
I don't need it, but it's nice the way Bourdieu explains it.

241
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,881
Hmm.

242
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,680
Well, if I don't find it in a minute, I give up.

243
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,440
But I know I marked it.

244
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,480
Here it is.

245
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:55,961
Okay.

246
00:29:56,121 --> 00:30:02,760
Only a virtuoso with a perfect command of his art of living can play on all the resources inherent.

247
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:11,000
Now listen to this describing Alcibiades, a brilliant, unscrupulous, self-serving master.

248
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,921
Only a virtuoso and anybody know the the sort of biography of Bourdieu, no Bourdieu.

249
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:20,440
He's an absolutely amazing example of this.

250
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:31,521
I mean, he's so smart and so self-promoting that he got himself from being a a balanced proponent through the French system to the Collège de France.

251
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:36,960
And he did it partly because he was brilliant, but you don't just get to the Collège de France by being brilliant.

252
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:43,440
You've got to go to the right tea parties and meet the right people and drink their wine and say the right things.

253
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,760
And he did all of that, and he was very pleased with himself, and rightly so.

254
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,641
And now I think of him as a cultural virtuoso.

255
00:30:50,801 --> 00:31:12,320
Only a virtuoso with a perfect command of his art of living can play on all the resources inherent in the ambiguities and uncertainties of behavior and situations in order to produce the options appropriate to each case to do that of which people will say there was nothing else to be done and to do it in the right way.

256
00:31:12,321 --> 00:31:14,080
I mean, I think that's cleverness.

257
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:15,360
That's Alcibiades.

258
00:31:15,361 --> 00:31:20,560
And Bourdieu, and I've mixed it up why I'm saying it, with Renesis.

259
00:31:20,641 --> 00:31:37,840
I don't, and Bourdieu, I'm almost forgetting the punchline, Hasno doesn't say that he does it for the sake of the inner goods of the practice, that is, he, the cultural virtuoso, or that he does it for the good as understood by his culture.

260
00:31:37,841 --> 00:31:41,361
He just does it presumably to get ahead.

261
00:31:41,601 --> 00:31:53,361
He manages to exchange gifts more cleverly than anybody else, which is a tricky business according to Bourdieu and the Berbers, because you have to give, if you give the gift back too soon, it's wrong.

262
00:31:53,361 --> 00:31:55,440
And if you give a gift back too late, it's wrong.

263
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,560
And if you give a gift back, it's not as sumptuous as the gift you got, that's wrong.

264
00:32:00,561 --> 00:32:04,480
But if you give an overwhelmingly cooperative gift back, that's wrong.

265
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,240
And the idea, and you won't learn any rules for it.

266
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:14,840
You've just got to learn how to give a gift in a way that gets you respected and what you want.

267
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:18,121
Okay, now, where are we?

268
00:32:19,401 --> 00:32:51,000
So, and the other really important difference that is, in which the difference now between the resolute Dasein acting as a master in his culture is that, and here I'm amazed at my own, that Aristotle isn't saying what I think he should say, and Heidegger is saying, in effect, what Aristotle should have said, and that's got to do with the role of reflection in being a master.

269
00:32:51,401 --> 00:33:04,521
Now, Aristotle knows better than to think that the master has to reflect on what principles to follow, what rules, or whatever, to do whatever that master does.

270
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:18,921
But as I understand it, and some of you may correct me, what happens is, and I've always had this phrase in my mind, that the pharmaceut straightway does the appropriate thing at the appropriate time in the appropriate way.

271
00:33:18,921 --> 00:33:21,721
And I couldn't find anywhere the straight way.

272
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,560
There was all this doing the appropriate thing talk.

273
00:33:26,201 --> 00:33:40,361
And now I think Aristotle thinks, and please correct me if I'm wrong, that the pharmaceutically sees what is the appropriate thing to do, but then has to reflect in order to do it.

274
00:33:40,361 --> 00:33:51,241
He has to test it, check it out, see understand that it's the appropriate thing to do, not just see it as attracting him before he can actually respond to it.

275
00:33:51,241 --> 00:33:58,801
If so, that's just going to be one thought too many, as Roost quotes Harry Frankfurt.

276
00:33:58,801 --> 00:34:00,640
No, it's Bernard Williams talking about.

277
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:08,080
I mean, the eponymous doesn't need to see it as the right thing to do or that it's the right thing to do.

278
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,520
That's all too conceptual.

279
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:25,681
All the pharmaceut has to do is be so pruned to the situations in his culture, having done lots of actions and suffered from the bad ones and happy with the good ones, that he does, when he sees what to do as he does it.

280
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,361
347, Heidegger says it.

281
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,521
And I think it's wonderful, but it goes by awfully fast.

282
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,520
This, I think, distinguishes.

283
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,521
Now, what I'm saying is distinguishing resoluteness from Fernacus without saying it.

284
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:47,761
So at the end of the second, the beginning of the second paragraph, second sentence out.

285
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,480
Resoluteness does not first take cognizance of the situation and put that situation before itself.

286
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,201
It has put itself into the situation already, which is now my favorite sentence.

287
00:34:59,201 --> 00:35:03,041
As resolute, Dasein is already taking action.

288
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,121
That's the straightway part.

289
00:35:05,841 --> 00:35:08,401
It's insofar as Dasein is resolute.

290
00:35:08,401 --> 00:35:15,360
Dasein doesn't have to sort of step outside and reflect on the situation.

291
00:35:16,721 --> 00:35:22,641
When something comes along that solicits this appropriate action, the pharmaceut does it.

292
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:29,921
Now, and Aristotle, I guess all this relates to Aristotle is more and more fascinating me.

293
00:35:30,241 --> 00:35:32,720
This is something now, too, that's interesting.

294
00:35:32,721 --> 00:35:34,400
Let me just not lose you, though.

295
00:35:35,361 --> 00:35:50,201
Yeah, Aristotle does understand that mastery in everyday field is reflectionless, I think, because he says in the physics at one point, Nay does not reflect.

296
00:35:43,761 --> 00:35:51,160
Now, that's interesting.

297
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:58,760
That means that the craftsman who has mastery just immediately does the appropriate thing at the appropriate time.

298
00:35:58,761 --> 00:36:02,280
If you're making a vase or a statue, it's a dance.

299
00:36:02,281 --> 00:36:04,361
You see, Aristotle sees that.

300
00:36:04,361 --> 00:36:21,241
Why he doesn't see that the social virtuoso, well, I can't use that term anymore, the social master, the mastery of the culture, the phronomist can't do as well as the craftsman and not reflect, I don't understand.

301
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:26,921
I mean, I think it's just wrong, and I think it's interesting that Heidegger got the phenomena right there.

302
00:36:26,921 --> 00:36:35,801
Heidegger sees that the resolute cultural master does not reflect at all, he's straightway, that's what I think that sentence says.

303
00:36:37,241 --> 00:36:40,600
And the sad, now where do I want to put this?

304
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:50,840
And when he does act, he doesn't act because in some way he's understood, that's a situation called for that sort of action.

305
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:53,480
That's again too conceptual.

306
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:59,801
When he acts, he, being a phronomist, his action defines the situation.

307
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:16,361
If he gives a great big gift spontaneously on the occasion when gift-giving happens, it defines that as the kind of situation where you better give that guy an overwhelming gift and embarrass him, or you're going to be embarrassed, or some such move.

308
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:20,281
So he says that on 346.

309
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:23,960
That the phronomist enacting defines the situation.

310
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,081
Well, the resolute doesn't mean.

311
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,440
I think this applies to the pharmaceutical, too.

312
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,921
So let me sort this out before I confuse you.

313
00:37:28,841 --> 00:37:36,081
So the pharmaceut reflects, and the master, the cultural master does it.

314
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:40,881
The pharmaceut does it for the sake of the good and the cultural master.

315
00:37:41,201 --> 00:37:50,080
But what the pharmaceutical and the culture and the master have in common is that what they do defines what the situation is.

316
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:58,721
There's no sort of fact of the matter about the situation except that they made it into the situation they did by acting the way they acted.

317
00:37:58,721 --> 00:38:01,841
This is on 346.

318
00:38:01,841 --> 00:38:02,960
Somewhere.

319
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,881
Yeah, okay.

320
00:38:07,921 --> 00:38:15,440
About in that big middle paragraph about three-quarters of the way down, oh, where it says 300 in the margin.

321
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:25,841
Far removed from any present-at-hand mixture of circumstances and accidents which we encounter, the situation is only through resoluteness and in it.

322
00:38:26,401 --> 00:38:29,120
So you can give an objective situation.

323
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,360
That would be, you know, the general situation.

324
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,721
This is a general situation of gift-giving.

325
00:38:34,721 --> 00:38:41,121
But what this particular situation of gift-giving is, is absolutely concrete and particular.

326
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:56,081
And when the pharmaceut does it and people see that that was obviously the right thing to do, that's see that sort of speaker pharmaceuticals made it into a situation in which you give an overwhelming gift, for example.

327
00:38:58,401 --> 00:39:24,520
But and now a way that Heidegger and I agree, that Aristotle just has missed something crucial is that the pharmaceut on the basis of his cultural background and in no way calls that cultural background into question.

328
00:39:25,401 --> 00:39:28,280
Now let's translate that into resolute Dasein.

329
00:39:28,281 --> 00:39:46,841
Resolute Dasein does the appropriate thing in the concrete current context, and he does the appropriate thing on the basis of having totally assimilated and learned how you behave in that culture.

330
00:39:46,841 --> 00:40:02,041
But he doesn't have the kind of radical anxiety that falls into the, doesn't reflect on it, but senses the ungroundedness of the whole cultural background that he's acting on the basis of.

331
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,960
Again, not to be mysterious, only death can do that.

332
00:40:06,681 --> 00:40:24,201
That is, the resolute person, like the pharonomist, like Aristotle's person, has felt the ungroundedness of the cultural background on the basis of which they act.

333
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:35,721
The ungroundedness of the cultural situation on the basis of which they act, that would be a more radical kind of anxiety than the resolute Dasein.

334
00:40:35,721 --> 00:40:38,361
That would be anticipatory resoluteness.

335
00:40:38,361 --> 00:40:41,001
And we're debating that next time.

336
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:58,720
But now, I got in the position of being able to read the whole complicated page here on page 330, where all of this comes into now if now.

337
00:40:58,681 --> 00:40:59,681
We're in Heidegger.

338
00:40:58,921 --> 00:41:02,960
Maybe that's not, I think I should stop at that point.

339
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:08,480
We're not going to be talking about what Aristotle says anymore, or Bourgieu says, or Dreyfus says.

340
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:17,841
What I want to talk about is Heidegger's understanding of what it is to be resolute.

341
00:41:17,841 --> 00:41:29,040
And I'm going to talk about that as a criticism of a whole cognitivist, Kantian way of being.

342
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:33,600
It's a question, what's the most good person?

343
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:38,801
Heidegger's got his story here on 330 of that resolute good person.

344
00:41:38,801 --> 00:41:43,281
And it says you can't get behind your thronists.

345
00:41:43,361 --> 00:41:45,120
I mean, that's the phrase you keep needing.

346
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:50,321
And that's a criticism of a whole lot of views, most views, maybe all views, I don't know.

347
00:41:50,321 --> 00:41:51,680
Maybe not you, I don't know.

348
00:41:51,681 --> 00:41:54,081
Lots of views in philosophy anyway.

349
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:11,760
But before I do, what I'm going to do next is try to describe in detail what the sort of the theory of resolute action from Heidegger's point of view, no, that's not the phenomenon of resolute action and what follows from it.

350
00:42:11,761 --> 00:42:14,000
That's where Ruth and Paper is going to come in.

351
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:16,561
I think it's a good point to stop for a moment.

352
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:22,960
Clearly, people have had feeling that I, yeah, I could see Eugene having feelings that I needed some help.

353
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,080
Go ahead.

354
00:42:24,321 --> 00:42:25,761
Bad at everything.

355
00:42:25,761 --> 00:42:26,560
Ah.

356
00:42:28,321 --> 00:42:32,081
I have to put it back in context.

357
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,440
At everything.

358
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,480
But responding to the concrete situation.

359
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,680
Well, wouldn't he design it?

360
00:42:37,761 --> 00:42:41,241
I guess there must be a distinction between respond, but I see the issue.

361
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:46,600
Well, I guess there's two different kinds of bad.

362
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:47,400
Let's try that.

363
00:42:47,881 --> 00:42:52,841
I think that the cultural virtuoso can and alphabetes can be precisely bad.

364
00:42:52,841 --> 00:42:57,881
They can be bad at everything and not being a traitor, but they do it brilliantly.

365
00:42:58,281 --> 00:43:07,080
But but what I think you can't be is bad at everything in the sense of being a clutch and you know messing up everything as you do it.

366
00:43:07,241 --> 00:43:08,361
It's bungler.

367
00:43:08,361 --> 00:43:21,881
You can't do that because if you're a bungler, you're still acting on what you think are or sort of feel or something are the rules and right ways of doing things or so what one does, I think.

368
00:43:21,881 --> 00:43:25,401
And then you could only be a sort of novice.

369
00:43:25,401 --> 00:43:27,960
I'm just trying to pick a fill in more.

370
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,521
What kind of bad person do you think the resolute dosign could be?

371
00:43:32,841 --> 00:43:36,841
So change is simple case or government.

372
00:43:36,921 --> 00:43:43,720
You know, I guess that's the question, but you have to be an authentic or standard doskin and his hands all through wage.

373
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,321
Okay, I see.

374
00:43:45,321 --> 00:43:46,361
Can you hear him?

375
00:43:46,361 --> 00:43:58,361
I mean, so what about somebody who has a stroke in this example so that they aren't skillful anymore, like Michael Jordan can't play basketball well anymore.

376
00:43:58,921 --> 00:44:04,520
But their state of designing is nonetheless resolute.

377
00:44:07,401 --> 00:44:19,800
So and the moral is supposed to be that you can do the appropriate thing at the appropriate time in the appropriate way and still not be, oh no.

378
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:25,640
You know, you could still be resolute but not do the appropriate thing in this the appropriate time in the appropriate way.

379
00:44:26,281 --> 00:44:26,680
I see.

380
00:44:26,761 --> 00:44:29,200
So resoluteness is not a skill level.

381
00:44:29,201 --> 00:44:31,041
It's not like mastery.

382
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,521
That's interesting, yes.

383
00:44:33,761 --> 00:44:35,601
Skills are much important.

384
00:44:36,401 --> 00:44:50,320
Resoluteness would be corresponding to the skills at a different time and place, that exactly able to design for those skills, and then I can reference a dialogue, they'll get that mastery condition.

385
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,841
Skills no longer match, but use different music.

386
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,040
Well, yeah, but you still get what Eugene's trying to do.

387
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:08,480
Take apart, if you get him still resolute after his skills no longer match or no longer work, then you've broken resoluteness apart from cultural mastery.

388
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:22,081
And I'm the one who put in the cultural mastery story, except again, I got a sort of, I see the problem, and yet I don't see if.

389
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:29,921
So you could still be, well, let me go back around where I was for a second, and then I'll let you talk.

390
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:39,440
I'm still trying to get my head around the idea that to be resolute, you've got to respond to the concrete situation and respond appropriately to concentrate.

391
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,240
Isn't that a definition of resolute?

392
00:45:42,241 --> 00:45:46,000
I mean, that would, of course, prejudice the story in my direction.

393
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:46,960
So we better look.

394
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,881
Now I'll let you guys talk in a minute.

395
00:45:48,881 --> 00:45:54,721
Where's that critical place where the situation in italics comes into it?

396
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,760
I take it that that was supposed to be a definition of what resolute action looked like.

397
00:46:02,401 --> 00:46:03,521
Where is it?

398
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,681
Here it is on 346.

399
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:12,560
Let's all just read on 346 that top paragraph and see if we can answer this objection.

400
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,600
We may have to begin earlier.

401
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,001
Let me see.

402
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,841
No, we start there.

403
00:46:13,841 --> 00:46:17,401
I don't know.

404
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:35,641
I see that as you couldn't, you can't be, so to speak, resolute and not project yourself upon what is topically possible and break out of the they.

405
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:48,760
And it doesn't seem somehow that you could sort of what is topically possible for you now that you've had a stroke and break out of the everyday because you're acting differently.

406
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:57,321
Doesn't that look like it's discussion of somehow having to be able to act appropriately by the standards of the culture?

407
00:46:57,321 --> 00:46:58,680
Ah, well, that's interesting.

408
00:46:58,681 --> 00:46:59,480
Okay, try that.

409
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,880
So you have to see what's practically possible for you.

410
00:47:01,881 --> 00:47:03,561
Let me look at it.

411
00:47:03,721 --> 00:47:05,401
Lesson simple.

412
00:47:05,401 --> 00:47:13,480
And the they knows only I'm going to the bottom, loses itself in opportunities and reckons up to accidents and so forth.

413
00:47:13,801 --> 00:47:17,960
Let's look at the top paragraph on 347, each to ourselves.

414
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:25,641
So we would getting called forth into the situation is whatever is practically possible for you.

415
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:30,921
And if you're resolute, it doesn't have to be highly skillful mastery.

416
00:47:30,921 --> 00:47:35,081
Still, you could respond by already taking action.

417
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:39,001
Still, you could define the situation by the way you act.

418
00:47:39,321 --> 00:47:46,361
It may be that acting as a master is a special trait of this more general notion.

419
00:47:46,361 --> 00:47:51,640
I still think resoluteness is a is a specially something or other way of acting.

420
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,240
It's not just bungling around.

421
00:47:53,281 --> 00:47:54,600
It's it's gotta be.

422
00:47:54,841 --> 00:47:58,161
Well, you say one more thing, and then there's a lot of people who want to talk.

423
00:47:57,801 --> 00:48:00,720
Oh, I I that's not a problem.

424
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,921
I d the resolute person isn't magically the uh a master.

425
00:48:05,921 --> 00:48:11,440
They what happens is they bungle around and follow rules and make mistakes and they stay resolute.

426
00:48:11,841 --> 00:48:13,520
Yeah, but that's that's all right.

427
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:18,160
They stay um they stay sort of on the fact of being a master.

428
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:23,440
I'm happy to separate resoluteness out and say it's not only mastery.

429
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,560
Maybe that's a good compromise.

430
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:33,760
It's not only mastery, but it's also what uh the certain conditions that that a masters and only masters have that enable them to become masters.

431
00:48:33,761 --> 00:48:35,041
They aren't yet.

432
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,401
Uh maybe.

433
00:48:36,401 --> 00:48:39,761
Anyway, now there's a dozen of so many people want to say things.

434
00:48:39,761 --> 00:48:42,000
Do you have any idea which order you had your hands up in?

435
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,921
Who had their hand up first?

436
00:48:44,241 --> 00:48:45,201
Okay.

437
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,881
You have to talk really loud.

438
00:48:46,881 --> 00:48:49,841
You're talking to people way over in China.

439
00:48:49,841 --> 00:48:51,841
It's impossible to do that.

440
00:48:52,160 --> 00:49:02,401
They don't become resolute by being the master to a skill and kids a little they seem to be working upon looking at their skill.

441
00:49:02,801 --> 00:49:06,000
Instinctively realized that people could do what they were doing.

442
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:11,921
Realize that he middle of 344 near the bottom.

443
00:49:11,921 --> 00:49:12,240
Okay.

444
00:49:13,201 --> 00:49:20,560
And the last thing I mean resoluteness brings itself right with first and third being alongside was bringing in.

445
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,361
And what do you think they're just living in good with others?

446
00:49:23,681 --> 00:49:30,960
And I can imagine for a looking at a teammate and realizing, you know, if I perceive like I can play right now, we're going to lose the game.

447
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,921
And instinctively knowing he's got a battle out.

448
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:38,641
And so okay, he frees himself, let's see.

449
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:46,360
There's just divine towards what makes it possible to let the others who are with it be in their most potentiality.

450
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,881
That's a whole dimension of it.

451
00:49:47,881 --> 00:49:52,521
I haven't talked about how the pharmaceut relates to the others.

452
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:59,801
I don't understand what it is really because of the conscience of others, which is what this paragraph is about.

453
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,200
And that's the next sentence.

454
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,361
So there's some way in which I think we should bracket that.

455
00:50:06,361 --> 00:50:17,401
I mean, there's a further story that has to be told about how the resolute Dasein and the phronomist relate to other Daseins.

456
00:50:17,401 --> 00:50:38,681
And Heidegger, I don't think it's Aristotle's pharmaceutical, has this sort of imperative to push other people into being authentic and bump in ahead of them and make them sort of take responsibility and act without groundedness and so forth.

457
00:50:39,801 --> 00:50:48,281
I can't see any sign that Aristotle thinks the phronomist is concerned about other people's becoming phronomi and how to help them do it.

458
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,520
I don't think any of these do.

459
00:50:50,841 --> 00:50:59,000
I think we just probably, I don't know what to say about that, but I don't want to, I mean, whatever we're doing, it should be able to answer it without worrying about others.

460
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:09,161
I mean, it's enough to worry about how Michael Jordan, whether Michael Jordan is resolute when his hand is hurt and he can't really play basketball very well.

461
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,240
I mean, it's funny.

462
00:51:11,241 --> 00:51:12,841
You can't just think his hand is broken.

463
00:51:12,841 --> 00:51:20,921
You've got to think, as Eugene said, if he had a stroke or something, he no longer has or will ever have again the capacity to play well.

464
00:51:20,921 --> 00:51:24,521
Then you ask yourself, well, is he still a master basketball player?

465
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,921
And I think the answer has to be, sadly, no.

466
00:51:26,921 --> 00:51:30,641
He has been master basketball player.

467
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:36,080
And then the question is, but is he still resolute or not?

468
00:51:36,401 --> 00:51:48,720
And then the answer is going to be something like, well, maybe he still has the resoluteness that made him able to become this master basketball player.

469
00:51:48,801 --> 00:51:53,041
He's lost the capacity to do it.

470
00:51:53,040 --> 00:52:20,320
But if he still lives in the anxiety of ungroundedness and responds to the unique situation, even if his response is now no longer masterful, I'm ready to say, yes, he's got so resoluteness is something like the appropriate response to the situation given the capacities and so forth of the Dazan.

471
00:52:20,321 --> 00:52:32,480
I think we can, and I won't be, I mean, I don't sort of lose anything I want when I say that, except I think it's true you can't tie it as tightly to mastery as I just did, but it's in the ballgame of mastery.

472
00:52:32,721 --> 00:52:33,120
Yeah.

473
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,841
But if you say it's still his mastery versus mastery at.

474
00:52:36,321 --> 00:52:37,280
You could say that.

475
00:52:37,281 --> 00:52:41,041
That's, I think, yeah, that's possible, I guess.

476
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,440
Of course, it's got to be prompting.

477
00:52:44,241 --> 00:52:44,720
That's alright.

478
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,041
It's masterful at acting the great way.

479
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:59,761
It does the appropriate thing at the appropriate time in the appropriate way given its factical situation, which means that it needn't look like a master in the big game.

480
00:52:59,761 --> 00:53:00,960
I think that's fine.

481
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,600
Yes.

482
00:53:01,841 --> 00:53:02,160
Yeah.

483
00:53:02,881 --> 00:53:05,281
These are Dazza might be resolute.

484
00:53:05,281 --> 00:53:07,041
That's not game other.

485
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:12,881
I mean, if it's Michael Jordan, he might be, he might become a resolute basketball coach, but it seems being pretty good.

486
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:16,921
Well, that's right, or he's a resolute basketball player in the Special Olympics.

487
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:24,520
So, I mean, who's made his practical situation to be a disabled master basketball player?

488
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:27,960
I think that's what comes out of what Eugene is saying.

489
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:34,121
I mean, you don't have to be a master in the sense of the gold medal winner in the Olympics kind of master.

490
00:53:34,361 --> 00:53:39,881
But you've got to, again, I like that formulation that we came up with together somehow.

491
00:53:39,881 --> 00:53:46,841
You have to be able to do the appropriate thing at the appropriate time in the appropriate way, given your factical situation.

492
00:53:46,841 --> 00:53:48,440
That's that kind of mastery.

493
00:53:48,761 --> 00:53:56,521
Whereas there's another meaning of mastery, that if you can't win the game, run the four-minute mile and so forth, you're no master anymore.

494
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,560
That's not right.

495
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,881
That's that we've got to qualify that.

496
00:53:59,881 --> 00:54:03,080
But nothing, I think, that I'm saying hinges on it.

497
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:04,600
I don't know, does it?

498
00:54:06,281 --> 00:54:08,600
It's not an objective skill level, no.

499
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:14,520
It's something like, but it is, it's a kind of relative to the individual Dasein skill level.

500
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:19,000
That's I don't think anything else is going to follow, but we'll see.

501
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,921
So, yes.

502
00:54:21,241 --> 00:54:22,361
Talk loud, yeah.

503
00:54:25,801 --> 00:54:29,640
It'd be imperative across all areas of the Dalsey and why it's very good.

504
00:54:30,281 --> 00:54:32,440
I don't understand why the Dalsein should be.

505
00:54:32,761 --> 00:54:33,240
Good, good.

506
00:54:33,241 --> 00:54:35,241
That's a similar kind of point.

507
00:54:35,241 --> 00:54:41,881
In Aristotle, I think it's uh it has to be in behaving in a in the culture.

508
00:54:41,881 --> 00:54:47,640
It's it it it's not enough for an Aristotle to bring a pharnasis of uh pest.

509
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,560
Uh you could be a master of pest.

510
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,240
That's another distinction there.

511
00:54:51,241 --> 00:55:02,881
Uh it's but in in Heidegger, uh you could you could certainly play chess in a way that a resolute design plays chess.

512
00:55:02,881 --> 00:55:12,800
And so I think that that's a way Heidegger is generalizing it from the Aristotle story too.

513
00:55:12,801 --> 00:55:24,721
Not only does Heidegger think that you don't have to do it for the sake of the good, Bobby Fisher certainly was a master and he didn't play Beth for the sake of the good.

514
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:28,480
Whether he was resolute or not, he was so weird, I don't know.

515
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:38,960
But he could have been, he could have been, because I don't think Heidegger wants to build in for the internal goods of the practices or for the goods of the culture.

516
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,241
That's what they're asking.

517
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,720
And I think his resolute person doesn't have to do that.

518
00:55:45,201 --> 00:55:50,561
He never says that the resolute person has to do what the culture says.

519
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,401
Of course, it's sticky.

520
00:55:52,401 --> 00:55:56,081
I'm sure the anticipatory resolute person doesn't have to.

521
00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:07,840
And he's not sort of making a fuss about the fact that the resolute person isn't really fully resolute until they're anticipatorily resolute.

522
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:17,361
And then it turns out that sort of everything they do is grounded even in the background practices, as I understand it.

523
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:17,921
Yeah.

524
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:28,080
As you get more and more localized, though, it's a function of it, where it seems like then when we imagine the genealogy of a person is very particular than if they're not grounded.

525
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,280
And I think so.

526
00:56:29,281 --> 00:56:37,601
So it belongs to the the resolute person that they've got this general anxiety about all.

527
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:41,120
Yes, I think that that's got to be right.

528
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:48,760
But I don't think Heidegger thinks that you can have sort of localized ontological anxiety.

529
00:56:43,201 --> 00:56:56,201
I think you may be able to have localized anxiety about your health and whether there's a flu germ running around or something.

530
00:56:56,201 --> 00:57:02,841
But if you're a resolute Dasein, then you have a sense of what it is to be a Dasein, and that's general.

531
00:57:02,841 --> 00:57:05,081
And I think that's important.

532
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:23,000
And you could still say that unless you have that general sense of anxiety that it takes to be a Dasein, which pulls you out of level one, unless you have that, you also can't do all these local specific things to be a very good skateboarder.

533
00:57:23,241 --> 00:57:24,200
And that's all right.

534
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:30,040
I think I do think you can't have local and sort of skateboard anxiety.

535
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:33,001
You've got to have Dasein anxiety.

536
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,521
Yeah, Stephen.

537
00:57:35,241 --> 00:57:36,921
Now I keep coming closer.

538
00:57:36,921 --> 00:57:37,881
You keep talking loud.

539
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:38,601
What?

540
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,321
What?

541
00:57:40,281 --> 00:57:47,800
No, because you can't, that would be responding to the general situation, and the resolute Dasein never responds to the general situation.

542
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:55,160
So worrying about the first, sometimes the rest of my English still friends, choosing what?

543
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:56,600
Where does that?

544
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,480
Where, where, where?

545
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:08,121
I mean, I worry, because I know Heidegger does talk that way sometimes, but then you have to make a long speech about choice and how choice can't possibly mean what Heidegger.

546
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,081
Okay.

547
00:58:09,401 --> 00:58:10,921
314 in the German.

548
00:58:10,921 --> 00:58:11,480
Uh-oh.

549
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:12,120
Okay.

550
00:58:12,361 --> 00:58:15,000
314 or 270.

551
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,361
314 or 270.

552
00:58:16,361 --> 00:58:17,401
Okay, I'm going to read that.

553
00:58:18,681 --> 00:58:19,440
Yeah, I see.

554
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:24,361
Choosing, the choosing to choose the kind of being which in accordance with nature.

555
00:58:24,361 --> 00:58:28,161
Because that's that first definition of resoluteness, as you say.

556
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,361
Well, we've got to make a big distinction about choosing.

557
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:34,640
I wish I had brought in the the Schelling lecture.

558
00:58:34,721 --> 00:58:46,400
I'll bring it next time, where Heidegger sort of saw this very, maybe even these very pages, where he talks about what he said about choosing and being in time and changes it.

559
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:58,240
If choosing means sort of stepping outside the situation and deciding for this rather than that, then that's not what the Dasein normally does.

560
00:58:58,241 --> 00:59:00,720
The Dasein can't be choosing.

561
00:59:00,721 --> 00:59:04,721
It's a straight way the resolute Dasein acts.

562
00:59:04,721 --> 00:59:08,800
So in what way could the straight way acting Dasein be said to be choosing?

563
00:59:08,801 --> 00:59:24,960
Well, as I understand it, the word for choice in Aristotle is just that there are other ways they could have acted, not that they stood outside and saw the range of possibilities and then decided on one, one.

564
00:59:25,681 --> 00:59:35,120
It's a toy if what you just spontaneously do isn't all what you couldn't what you could have done.

565
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:43,521
I take it if you run into a burning building and save a child, you, in Aristotle's sense, chose to save the child.

566
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,960
But it could well be that phenomenologically it probably is.

567
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:52,161
But we're back to Bernard Williams jumping in and s the guy jumping in and saving his wife.

568
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,681
You just do it.

569
00:59:53,681 --> 00:59:57,040
And but we could see this other sense of choice.

570
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:00,480
What's the what's the uh Greek bouleistus or something like that?

571
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:01,921
Anybody knows the Greek?

572
01:00:01,921 --> 01:00:08,881
That's that that's Aristotle Greek couldn't mean something like choosing or choosing to choose.

573
01:00:08,881 --> 01:00:14,201
It's gotta mean doing something which they could also have done something else.

574
01:00:14,201 --> 01:00:15,081
Is that all right?

575
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,281
That would help.

576
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,121
What page?

577
01:00:13,761 --> 01:00:19,881
213.

578
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:23,401
Oh, three thirteen.

579
01:00:23,401 --> 01:00:24,520
No, you're like, okay, I got it.

580
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,440
Three thirteen, it's gonna be.

581
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:30,121
Oh, yes, that's like this is all that weird stuff about choosing.

582
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,041
Yeah, I see that.

583
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,440
A decision.

584
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:35,241
Ah.

585
01:00:35,241 --> 01:00:44,840
Well, I will definitely bring in next time the places where he talks about choosing and being in time and says that he got it wrong.

586
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:50,601
Whether that's exactly this wrong, I I don't dare say without looking at it again.

587
01:00:50,921 --> 01:00:52,120
But it better not be.

588
01:00:52,120 --> 01:01:04,440
I mean, oh, what I would say if I mean listening to this, is clearly there's a contradiction between choosing and making a decision on the one hand and straightway acting on the other.

589
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,560
Where is that again?

590
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:09,721
The situation already taking action.

591
01:01:09,721 --> 01:01:23,480
Putting yourself into the situation as already taking action, that's the one on 347, doesn't seem to be describable in a normal sense of choosing to choose, let alone deciding to choose to choose, which is what it seems there.

592
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:32,761
And so I just I think I think Heidegger's just getting it wrong, and that's what happens in Division II sometimes.

593
01:01:32,761 --> 01:01:36,361
And I think Heidegger thinks he's getting it wrong, because I have to go prove that.

594
01:01:36,361 --> 01:01:40,121
That would make s I'll expect out of the problem.

595
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:40,600
Yeah.

596
01:01:41,241 --> 01:01:43,320
Um I have two questions.

597
01:01:43,321 --> 01:01:48,040
First of all, is it fair to characterize resolution for you know, that you're writing a thing?

598
01:01:48,281 --> 01:01:48,760
No.

599
01:01:49,881 --> 01:01:58,480
Because of that funny passage about tell jumping into the other and being the conscience of the other, that can't be making the other person as ready to hand.

600
01:01:57,321 --> 01:02:01,120
Racial readiness to hand, if I can say.

601
01:02:01,361 --> 01:02:10,401
I mean, basically what I'm getting at here is that readiness of hand is defined in my understanding as just reacting non-final.

602
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,841
I see, I see what you mean.

603
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,160
You manipulate a handle with level 10.

604
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:15,440
Okay, I see what you're saying.

605
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:15,680
Yeah.

606
01:02:15,841 --> 01:02:23,841
It'd be a very like a really often version of reading to hand kind of, because unlike normal readiness to hand, you need to work a lot to get the resolution of something.

607
01:02:23,841 --> 01:02:26,080
But it still seems of always going to be difficult.

608
01:02:26,241 --> 01:02:26,720
Okay, good.

609
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:31,681
Generally, though, I mean, at first level, yes, I agree with you.

610
01:02:32,241 --> 01:02:34,000
But you don't really have to work a lot.

611
01:02:34,321 --> 01:02:35,600
I mean, sorry, you do.

612
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,480
You said you don't.

613
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:37,361
You do work a lot.

614
01:02:38,321 --> 01:02:39,600
I think you have to work a lot too.

615
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:40,480
Oh, you're thinking about the hammer.

616
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:41,840
Yeah, even with a hammer.

617
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:43,361
You can't just pick up and hammer.

618
01:02:43,361 --> 01:02:47,040
You can't even pick up and walk without a lot of effort and following around.

619
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:57,440
So getting the skill to do straight away things like hammering or going out the door is certainly something that happens with Dodge Eyes.

620
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:02,560
Why isn't that the same as resolute coping?

621
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:13,440
And I see why you say that, because it's got this thing in common with expertise at hammering and expertise at gift giving.

622
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:20,480
They are all unreflective, and straight away you do them, and it takes a lot of experience to get so you can do them.

623
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,681
Aristotle says that about the pharmaceutical.

624
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,280
Doing the appropriate things.

625
01:03:29,281 --> 01:03:34,000
All that is true, but there's this very important feature of the ready-to-hand that this doesn't have.

626
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,721
That's why I jumped and said no.

627
01:03:38,401 --> 01:03:40,881
You're always using something instrumentally.

628
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:46,280
The ready-to-hand is introduced as always having it towards wish and order to, and so forth and so forth.

629
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:53,801
And that's why I mentioned the relation to the other Daseine is certainly not using them like equipment.

630
01:03:53,801 --> 01:04:08,281
So relating to them as ready-to-hand, I think, is defined as relating to something as equipment, and then you do it transparently, flow and coping, and so forth.

631
01:04:08,281 --> 01:04:12,200
And then there is relating to other Dasein, and that's not relating to them.

632
01:04:12,361 --> 01:04:14,121
That's mid-Dasein.

633
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:19,720
And that is also, and that's your point, totally unreflective.

634
01:04:19,721 --> 01:04:24,760
It has to be learned when you do it, but it isn't going to be called treating them as ready-to-hand.

635
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:25,641
Okay?

636
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:26,281
That sounds right.

637
01:04:26,761 --> 01:04:27,480
You're not using.

638
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:32,921
And you can treat people as ready-to-hand, for sure, like you do the fact here in the bank or something.

639
01:04:32,921 --> 01:04:35,561
But you don't necessarily do it.

640
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:36,841
Okay?

641
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:39,401
Certainly there are people discussing there.

642
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:46,600
Was it a state of being, either meaning to have forevermore, or is it like something that we have in certain endeavors?

643
01:04:50,361 --> 01:05:03,881
I think it's something you were saying, but I don't think of any page, because when you keep saying the resolute Dasein and the anticipatorily resolute Dasein and the authentic Dasein, you certainly lose it.

644
01:05:03,881 --> 01:05:06,680
You can be there because you can be back in the untruth.

645
01:05:06,681 --> 01:05:08,600
You can flee it and so forth.

646
01:05:08,921 --> 01:05:15,640
Unless you make a positive effort, maybe, I mean, I'm going to say unless you make a positive effort, you don't lose it.

647
01:05:15,801 --> 01:05:18,200
Maybe it definitely could.

648
01:05:18,921 --> 01:05:22,121
I'm very interested whether anybody can help me with this.

649
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:45,121
I would say, I don't know whether people who have held on to anxiety and become resolute and anticipatorily resolute and authentic just lose it by lose it in the following way, by just seeing groundlessness and all three kinds of anxiety.

650
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:53,680
It seems to me once you've done it, managed to live authentically, it's complicated.

651
01:05:53,681 --> 01:05:59,600
When you manage to live authentically, you'll see when you get laid further into division two, it's joyful.

652
01:05:59,921 --> 01:06:10,081
And why would you want to flee this sort of heightened, rewarding sensitivity that you have when you're resolute dash?

653
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:16,080
However, I can't think of any place where he says that you don't, you don't flee it.

654
01:06:17,361 --> 01:06:19,840
My hunch is he thinks that you don't.

655
01:06:19,841 --> 01:06:21,440
But keep your eyes open.

656
01:06:21,761 --> 01:06:28,881
Can you sort of, once you've been authentic, flee into inauthenticity, or is it a kind of state of grace?

657
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,320
Are you going to say something on this specific topic?

658
01:06:34,321 --> 01:06:35,600
Okay, then we'll turn it down.

659
01:06:36,801 --> 01:06:40,640
We're going to have a Sunday beetle from the part of how we get the resolution.

660
01:06:40,721 --> 01:06:42,480
Keep repeating it all the time.

661
01:06:43,281 --> 01:06:46,161
You just naturally cover things up.

662
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:52,480
I guess, I bet, my bet is that this is the very thing that he seems to be so ambivalent about.

663
01:06:53,201 --> 01:06:59,440
It's this idea that we're all essentially always falling and have this tendency to flee.

664
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:12,240
And this other w a story that uh y you, what, that we are called by our conscience always to face up to what Dasein really is.

665
01:07:12,521 --> 01:07:19,881
And we've got this we're always being pulled both ways and so we can always I'm just sort of getting inside the way you see it.

666
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:33,960
And so we uh can always laugh and not listen to the the voice of conscience which is calling us to be authentic and resolute and so forth and fall back into fleeing and taking it easy and so forth.

667
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,080
That might be so.

668
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:43,080
Can you remember to keep that but I mean I want to keep track of the issues that I don't know the answer to that I think.

669
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:44,921
Will somebody get there?

670
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:46,601
I'm just going to get a pen.

671
01:07:46,601 --> 01:07:52,040
So I want to I want to look to keep your eyes open.

672
01:07:52,360 --> 01:08:06,761
Does a pen and does authentic design fall back into fleeing.

673
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:07,720
Okay.

674
01:08:07,721 --> 01:08:08,520
I don't know.

675
01:08:08,761 --> 01:08:09,000
Yeah.

676
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,280
Once we talk about data.

677
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:16,440
So the example three forty eight is on the Fair Expensive.

678
01:08:16,441 --> 01:08:23,240
So when we are already talking about Michael Jordan and he does be able, for example, to put that before him.

679
01:08:23,561 --> 01:08:27,801
This situation is already browsed off for God on these.

680
01:08:27,801 --> 01:08:36,120
So it's already as on 347, it says resolutions is already making that as manifest as it creates.

681
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:51,240
So I don't think that we can go inside that and think about how to go further than that situation, and how a resolution goes around situations and comes back over repeating those things.

682
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:55,841
Because browsering as a whole makes that situation appears as a law.

683
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:22,400
Yeah, but why can't I tell you sort of settled that, at least to my satisfaction, you you don't want to rule, say, para-collegiates and generally disabled people out of the possibility of being authentic and skillful within their factical limitations and say, no, sorry, they're not going to win any awards at ping pong, and then you say, so they couldn't be resolute.

684
01:09:22,801 --> 01:09:36,400
That's so I think we have to say that, you know, resolute Dasein does a masterful job with whatever they've got as in their mind and in their mental and physical capacity.

685
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:47,360
I mean, who should say that, even if we don't, even if Heidegger doesn't, I mean, maybe you know, if he hasn't gotten to the Nazi stage with it, I think where he would rule them out.

686
01:09:49,921 --> 01:09:57,761
As resoluteness, there are special ways of behavior belonging to the practical faculty, as contrasted with one that is theoretical.

687
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:10,641
However, as concerned tools are listed, so primordially unfolding things that it was already means to be supposed as a whole when we distinguish between theoretical and practical behavior.

688
01:10:10,801 --> 01:10:17,280
You cannot perceive out of these faculties by dialectic, which doesn't make a painter on the algorithm.

689
01:10:17,761 --> 01:10:19,761
Oh, well, that's a different issue.

690
01:10:19,761 --> 01:10:25,921
That just says that this is deeper, this discussion of resoluteness, than theory and practice distinction.

691
01:10:25,921 --> 01:10:34,960
You can be skillful in theory, you can be skillful with your microscope too, and in practice but in but still do science.

692
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:55,160
You could it's it's supposed to cut across all of them, you know, you can be skillful in dealing with people, that's the liciterature, but you therefore you can be resolute in your science, and then you would see the well, existential scientists are open.

693
01:10:56,521 --> 01:11:11,240
Yeah, well, you would see that there are other ways of doing things, and you would, well, I'm just trying to, I could do it, but I don't want to talk about science right now.

694
01:11:11,481 --> 01:11:13,721
But it's just more behavior.

695
01:11:13,721 --> 01:11:15,240
I mean, just for the time being.

696
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:20,280
All human activity can be done resolutely.

697
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:24,601
And all human beings can do activities resolutely.

698
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:27,641
That's the disabled time.

699
01:11:27,641 --> 01:11:32,600
And theory and practice can be done resolutely or not.

700
01:11:32,601 --> 01:11:38,040
That is not meaning do it in a general sort of way, in which you were like a normal scientist.

701
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:42,841
I was thinking of that just doing what all the scientists do and thinking this is how it has to be done.

702
01:11:42,841 --> 01:11:50,200
And then somebody like Fleming comes along and sees some old unknown in the past predicted is antibiotics.

703
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:53,080
And then you're not doing the normal thing.

704
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:53,641
That's all.

705
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:56,440
You could say it in any area, I think.

706
01:11:56,441 --> 01:11:58,200
Now, yeah, okay.

707
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:02,360
Okay.

708
01:12:02,681 --> 01:12:12,280
The existential attributes of any awkward, resolute Dasein include the items that you're supporting, which is called situation.

709
01:12:12,521 --> 01:12:18,200
So in a situation, well, yes, except that that's exactly the wrong way to put it, according to this.

710
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:22,040
There isn't any situation until Dasein does something.

711
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:27,801
Otherwise, we're standing outside and and describing the situation, say, this is a situ I did it myself wrongly.

712
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:32,721
This this is a situation of gift giving and then I said and uh and the Dasein does it terrifically.

713
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:34,641
That is a situation of gift g giving.

714
01:12:34,721 --> 01:12:45,680
Instead of uh poisoning the guy who's got all the money and the gifts or uh tricking him or something, that is it isn't just written on it that this is a situation of gift giving.

715
01:12:45,681 --> 01:12:54,560
So uh the so Dasein, also resolute Dasein, defines the situation by acting a certain way in it.

716
01:12:54,561 --> 01:13:03,040
Of course, irresolute, inauthentic Dasein has the sees the situation the way that they sees the situation and they see it all.

717
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:10,400
I mean, while I'm stuck with my penicillin story, I'm the they say throw out the mold in your Petri dish and start over again.

718
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:14,560
You don't you can't do any science with moldy with moldy germs.

719
01:13:14,561 --> 01:13:20,560
And Fleming sees that this is this that the mold is filling the germs and that's what we're trying to do.

720
01:13:20,561 --> 01:13:24,881
And that's and he doesn't see it the way the general situation.

721
01:13:24,881 --> 01:13:28,160
And but uh and uh why?

722
01:13:28,801 --> 01:13:38,560
And authentic Dasein always sees the specific situation and responds in a specific, concrete way.

723
01:13:38,561 --> 01:13:48,960
I I avoid saying unique only in the sense that there's nothing that says that you couldn't different Dasein or the same one on another occasion couldn't do exactly the same thing.

724
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:59,360
It doesn't have to be unique, but it has to be concrete and specific and not general the the way the Dasein the way resolute Dasein sees the situation, yeah.

725
01:13:59,921 --> 01:14:22,280
The authentic dollar the uh resolute Dahlia uh spoons here, or more homes, you serendipity sort of uh well, yeah, I I you make it sound sort of serendipity, but of course, Michael Williams making a basket or something, or some chess player, Bobby Paker, making a super move, isn't it?

726
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:39,080
Isn't serendipity exactly because it's because they spent years learning, failing, succeeding, living out in this risky area where they can't take the rules for granted and so forth, that they are able to we need another word than serendipity.

727
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:43,000
It's this doesn't Heidegger have a word for it?

728
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:45,560
That's right.

729
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:46,600
Yeah.

730
01:14:48,841 --> 01:14:54,360
It's these things, he's thinking outside the box, where the box does what one would normally do.

731
01:14:54,761 --> 01:14:59,560
He's not doing what one would normally do because he's a fronomous scientist.

732
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:11,400
And if he threw it all over and decided he could do it even better with acupuncture, that would be anticipatory resoluteness.

733
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:14,280
I mean, that would call the whole game into question.

734
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,360
You have to be facing death to do that.

735
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:17,720
He wasn't doing that.

736
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:20,360
Okay, one last thing, and then we should go on.

737
01:15:20,921 --> 01:15:23,721
And authentic Heinball Heinz and fleeing.

738
01:15:23,721 --> 01:15:33,721
And I think, generally, this idea of fleeing is our primordial theater being our deceased by everything that fleeing is something we're always doing or feeling or what is that?

739
01:15:33,721 --> 01:15:34,681
Is that what you said?

740
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:39,080
It's where we normally start is in fleeing.

741
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,280
We are fleeing.

742
01:15:40,681 --> 01:15:41,480
That's right.

743
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:51,160
That's because there is a tendency to cover up the unsettledness of the human beings.

744
01:15:51,481 --> 01:15:52,921
I take it that's what you're saying.

745
01:15:52,921 --> 01:15:53,720
Is that right?

746
01:15:53,721 --> 01:15:54,200
Yeah.

747
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:57,801
I'm saying it partly because I think the people couldn't hear you otherwise.

748
01:15:57,801 --> 01:15:58,520
Go ahead.

749
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:06,960
I think even though, if you are and you have fallen, you can't just ignore whether you have authorities.

750
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:13,921
And I think that if you do that, you're not really like working more about authenticity.

751
01:16:13,921 --> 01:16:16,000
And I think that's the ultimate goal.

752
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,681
It's strongly like.

753
01:16:17,841 --> 01:16:20,080
Ah, I see the bottom line what you just said.

754
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:28,240
If consciences have to be sort of constantly calling you to be authentic, then it must be, if you can't exist in it all the time.

755
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:35,601
I think you can all you could exist in it all the time, but you have to be resisting all the time the natural tendency.

756
01:16:35,601 --> 01:16:38,000
It's sort of like gravity, he describes it in one place.

757
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,200
It's like falling.

758
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:50,320
I mean, there's a tendency sort of pulling you down, pulling you away, because it's something I have to say at the Tidegarian, though I don't really understand it.

759
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,640
It's somehow painful.

760
01:16:52,641 --> 01:16:53,601
I don't know what to say.

761
01:16:53,601 --> 01:16:56,960
Frightening, I can't say because there's no object.

762
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:01,200
What I really don't understand, and I put it on the table, and I don't think it's my problem.

763
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:14,480
I think it's a deep, deep, deep problem in Heidegger, is why you have a tendency to flee anxiety at all, given that as long as you haven't become authentic, I can understand why you flee it after all.

764
01:17:14,481 --> 01:17:22,080
It's much more tranquilizing and reassuring to do things the way one does them and have principles that tell you what to do and so forth.

765
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:34,641
But once you've been authentic, you know that it's joyful, which is what he says, and that it wasn't so bad after all to be ungrounded and not have any principles to act on.

766
01:17:34,641 --> 01:17:43,000
In fact, it's terrific not to be ungrounded and to be able to just immediately respond appropriately to the situation.

767
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,520
Then I don't understand what this pulse of falling is anymore.

768
01:17:46,841 --> 01:18:04,600
Why should you be why either anxiety is an unpleasant bad thing, or it only looks like an unpleasant bad thing until you live in it, which is what I think he says, because the authentic Dasein, we've just been reading things like that.

769
01:18:04,601 --> 01:18:06,921
I just wouldn't stress them.

770
01:18:06,921 --> 01:18:15,801
Where you've got to do it all in the one, and that's not a problem if you relate rightly to the one.

771
01:18:16,441 --> 01:18:22,761
That is, you have to be enough in the one to be intelligible.

772
01:18:22,761 --> 01:18:25,881
And well, I think that's a different issue.

773
01:18:25,881 --> 01:18:26,841
I cancel that.

774
01:18:27,721 --> 01:18:29,881
We don't need to talk about that right now.

775
01:18:29,881 --> 01:18:38,520
All I want to say is that it only looks frightening or whatever it is, upsetting, unsettling, let's say that.

776
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:56,841
It is only unsettling that there is no ground which can tell you how to behave in any domain if you have been brought up with the rules, as everybody has been.

777
01:18:56,841 --> 01:19:18,200
Once you see that you could act appropriately and moreover, joyfully in not following any rules and responding to the concrete situation, then I don't understand why anybody would want to flee back into the inauthentic way of life.

778
01:19:18,521 --> 01:19:22,040
But that's and that's my, so I don't know how to answer you.

779
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:28,520
I mean, I think I think I think really, in a way, you're right about Heidegger and Heidegger is wrong.

780
01:19:28,521 --> 01:19:34,320
That is, you're right that Heidegger thinks that there's always a tendency to free anxiety.

781
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:42,960
And I don't understand what right Heidegger has to say that there is always a tendency to free anxiety unless he builds into Dasein a tendency to want to have everything grounded.

782
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,640
But why does Dasein have a tendency to want to have everything grounded?

783
01:19:46,641 --> 01:19:48,560
But that's not what I want to talk about today.

784
01:19:48,721 --> 01:19:57,200
But you've given me the transition in a way, because the second piece of what I wanted to talk about, by the way, I brought this because it showed up in my office.

785
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,881
Did anybody lose a black glove?

786
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:03,200
It's not the appropriate moment, but I will forget it otherwise.

787
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:04,080
Okay.

788
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:10,480
So what about this call of conscience and why is it silent?

789
01:20:10,481 --> 01:20:12,721
And what is it calling you to do?

790
01:20:12,721 --> 01:20:13,681
That's the other thing.

791
01:20:13,681 --> 01:20:17,520
It's another angle on the same questions, of course.

792
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:31,841
But conscience is sort of pulling you, you know, summoning you, making some kind of imperatives, but it's not telling you anything specific that you could do.

793
01:20:31,841 --> 01:20:34,160
That's the sense in which it's silent.

794
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:38,240
And it seems to be silent at several levels.

795
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:43,761
And this is what I'm not sure, whether Heidegger is saying this or whether I'm making it up.

796
01:20:43,761 --> 01:20:50,240
But I think that there's a silence, so to speak, at the top and at the bottom of behavior.

797
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:59,440
By that I mean conscience is calling you to be authentic and do whatever your calling is.

798
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:06,160
And your calling is not to be a banker or a teacher, but something very more general.

799
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:16,360
Your calling is to do, to be a world-disclosing, transparent being of Dazine activity.

800
01:21:13,761 --> 01:21:18,120
That's the highest thing.

801
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:21,801
You're being called to be authentic, to be just.

802
01:21:21,801 --> 01:21:26,600
But you're also, at the most basic level, being called.

803
01:21:26,601 --> 01:21:27,801
I mean, let me start again.

804
01:21:27,801 --> 01:21:28,761
I'm not being good.

805
01:21:28,761 --> 01:21:33,400
I'm trying to understand why the call of conscience is silent.

806
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:37,960
Why there is something that consciousness calls you to do that cannot be said.

807
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:42,360
And I think one of the things it calls you to do is just to be authentic.

808
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:44,600
And there's nothing more we can say about that.

809
01:21:44,601 --> 01:21:47,480
Each person will have to do it in their own way.

810
01:21:47,481 --> 01:21:50,200
You just have to answer that calling.

811
01:21:50,681 --> 01:21:53,960
It's not a calling like being a monk or a doctor.

812
01:21:54,601 --> 01:21:56,440
That's, I don't think.

813
01:21:56,761 --> 01:22:03,720
But then there's the bottom, there's also something calling you, which has to be silent.

814
01:22:03,721 --> 01:22:09,160
And that's the unique situation calling from you the appropriate response.

815
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:18,040
That's just to say conscience can't tell you in this, this is a social situation, and in that kind of situation, do such and such.

816
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:28,120
It's got to be silent about often, down to the most basic level, where it can't even tell you sort of sort of what the doors are for going out.

817
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:32,040
And in this situation, you see it as a door, and therefore you go out.

818
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:35,960
All that's much too much talking for much too much talking.

819
01:22:36,521 --> 01:22:38,520
That's a bottom level of acting.

820
01:22:38,521 --> 01:22:41,721
You simply respond to the two go-out.

821
01:22:42,521 --> 01:22:47,641
I don't know, but it seems to me that's one other way conscience is silent.

822
01:22:47,641 --> 01:22:53,320
Maybe it's, I mean, I feel like not saying it because conscience is such a fancy word.

823
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:57,000
It ought to apply to the calling to be authentic.

824
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:04,160
But after all, we're trying to make conscience mean, I think, something, you know, where we're doing the formal indication.

825
01:23:04,481 --> 01:23:11,761
And maybe conscience is any silent calling that brings Dasein out at its best.

826
01:23:11,761 --> 01:23:28,400
And that's from the top to the bottom, from the silent calling of the world of skillful coping and quo to the silent calling that keep telling you be what Dasein manifests in your behavior what Dasein is.

827
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:29,921
It could be any of those.

828
01:23:29,921 --> 01:23:34,480
I mean, I take it that Heidegger is only here anyway.

829
01:23:34,561 --> 01:23:45,680
This passage is interested in Dasein, conscience calling Dasein to be authentic in the sense of not doing what the anyone does.

830
01:23:45,921 --> 01:23:53,440
Now I'm back to my other thing, but that's also true of the expert in science and in test and even in going outdoors.

831
01:23:53,441 --> 01:24:05,440
And if there is some, maybe Vahe, who is a student here and wrote a highest honors thesis, said that there's no such thing as the authentic way to wash your hands.

832
01:24:05,441 --> 01:24:06,400
And maybe that's right.

833
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:11,841
Maybe going outdoors, going out of door, is something you just do in a general sort of way.

834
01:24:11,841 --> 01:24:28,080
But there's a whole range of stuff that you do that is, you do in responding to the unique situation or the concrete situation, which won't be put into words in terms of rules and principles and standards.

835
01:24:29,681 --> 01:25:06,040
And if it's the they, that is the the one, that is d responds to the general situation, an authentic Dasein doesn't respond to the auth to the general situation, but to the concrete situation, and that's what conscience calls Dasein to do, respond to the concrete situation, then I want to say, look at that, that's a huge spectrum of activity from the most basic kind of coping to the very special sort of existentialist thing, the authentic.

836
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:10,520
Okay, I don't know if I have more to say about that, so let me look, maybe not.

837
01:25:10,921 --> 01:25:30,040
I'm trying to understand why conscience must be silent, and the answer is sort of, well, though it can't tell you how to be, you know, to face up to what it is to be Dasein, to be authentic in everything you do, to manifest your throwiness in your and your being unto death and your behavior.

838
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:38,040
But also, it can't be calling you to do all sorts of everyday appropriate things.

839
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:48,440
I'm sorry, what did I it can't tell you the general rules for how to be Dasein, and it can't tell you any general rules for how to be good at anything.

840
01:25:48,601 --> 01:25:49,400
Let me read it.

841
01:25:49,881 --> 01:25:53,080
The situation of authentic action is concrete and specific.

842
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:54,921
It's not based on a life plan.

843
01:25:54,921 --> 01:25:56,200
Oh, I wanted to get to that.

844
01:25:57,080 --> 01:26:02,521
Throwing this.

845
01:26:03,721 --> 01:26:04,200
I see.

846
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:09,240
Well, I I said it better when I wrote it here, so I'll say it as I think as I said it here.

847
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:12,200
And I want to talk about both of these, and we have time.

848
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:20,600
I think that conscience calls you to resolute constant is one issue.

849
01:26:20,601 --> 01:26:30,400
And the other is the forenasic issue, that conscience calls you to concrete specific.

850
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:36,801
And resolute boy, I'm not as happy with what I've written here with what I'm trying to say.

851
01:26:36,801 --> 01:26:38,160
Let me keep trying.

852
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:39,761
Okay.

853
01:26:39,761 --> 01:26:41,681
I'll just sort of try to blurt it out.

854
01:26:41,681 --> 01:26:46,561
The silence of the call of conscience, I'll say it by in terms of what it's denying.

855
01:26:46,641 --> 01:26:48,881
That's all all we've held for.

856
01:26:48,881 --> 01:26:58,000
So the sil the conscience can't use any language that's called you to be an authentic diaspora.

857
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:00,000
Then what is that denying?

858
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:07,761
Well, that's denying that you can have a kind of narrative that describes who you are and justifies what you're doing.

859
01:27:07,761 --> 01:27:14,801
The whole paper, the Roost paper, the anti-Husteral in this, but it could be, I think, anti-Kant.

860
01:27:15,441 --> 01:27:25,921
That is and it's it's the statement that it's not any kind of principles or anything like that that should give you any kind of guidelines in life.

861
01:27:25,921 --> 01:27:33,120
The things show up for you as mattering, and that forms the background of your action, and you can't get behind that.

862
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,561
That's the Root paper.

863
01:27:34,561 --> 01:27:56,960
That's one of the things that silent conscience tells you is you're guilty, and that means that there's the what what kind of self you are or who you are isn't something that you can and w what you do after interacting at your best isn't something that you can uh justify.

864
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:58,480
You can't say anything about it.

865
01:27:58,481 --> 01:28:00,721
That's you're just called to do it.

866
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,360
One of the so I want to we'll discuss both of these.

867
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:24,761
There's the Roots anti-Kantian, you the anti-autonomy, that there's m that when your conscience is silent because there's nothing you can say about what the right thing to do is, authentic Dasein is just able to do the appropriate thing at the appropriate time in the appropriate way, period.

868
01:28:24,761 --> 01:28:31,881
And the other thing is that you always are responding.

869
01:28:31,881 --> 01:28:33,160
This is at the top level.

870
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:41,480
Remember, I said at the bottom level, you were always responding to the concrete solicitations of the situation.

871
01:28:41,481 --> 01:28:44,040
And that's, what's the opposite of that?

872
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:46,440
Well, what's the opposite of that is cognitivism.

873
01:28:46,441 --> 01:29:00,841
That there are standard rules for playing good fetch or for coping or for driving or for anything, and that you could learn to obey the best rules and learn to follow them.

874
01:29:02,761 --> 01:29:14,040
So one of the ways conscience is silent is calling you to be yourself, to visit whatever that is, and it can't tell you anything about how to do it or what it is to do it.

875
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:27,080
And the other thing is it's calling you to respond to the concrete situation, to do the appropriate thing at the appropriate time in the appropriate way, and it can't tell you what the situation is or what the appropriate thing to do is.

876
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:34,921
So the silence of conscience is against two kinds of conceptualism.

877
01:29:34,921 --> 01:29:48,280
That is, there's the conceptualism that goes with thinking that you can have a worked-out account of who you are, where I want to see where I put it in terms of conceptualism here.

878
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:56,761
Well, I don't em opposes I was I wrote Kantianism on the one hand and opposes conceptualism on the other, although I think it should be both of them.

879
01:29:56,761 --> 01:30:12,641
So I'm going to read it to see why I think it's for Heidegger when acting at his best, the resolute design is responding to the unique situation, both responding in an overall to an overall calling that can't be conceptualized because it's on a background that can't be conceptualized.

880
01:30:12,641 --> 01:30:14,720
That's rude story.

881
01:30:14,721 --> 01:30:27,440
And you're acting with masterful skill that can't be conceptualized because there are no principles that dictate what the situation is and what an appropriate response to that situation is.

882
01:30:27,441 --> 01:30:36,640
So the whole style of the silence of the call of conscience is Heidegger's anti-conceptualism, I want to say, on the two most basic levels.

883
01:30:36,641 --> 01:30:45,600
The top level of what it is to be you and the bottom level of what it is to respond to the by hoping to the current situation.

884
01:30:45,601 --> 01:30:51,040
Now I've got pages for those things, so let me just no, let's just do them.

885
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:58,160
I mean you well let me read you, let's start with you, because I want to certainly talk about it.

886
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:15,680
The whole silence of the call of conscience is and the fact and the fact that you can't get behind your thrownness is obviously meant to be a critique of a position where you can be autonomous, where you should understand what you're doing and be able to justify what you're doing.

887
01:31:15,681 --> 01:31:25,360
And he's saying, no, that's all part of the anyone, that if you are authentic, you can't put what you're doing into words at all.

888
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:38,160
And when he talked about it, I like what Ruth says at times, and that's why I I ask you to read it, because I guess you can just say, oh, well, Heidegger says you can't get behind your throwiness.

889
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:39,761
That's where this comes in.

890
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:54,360
And you can't sort of proves to be you for reasons you can give, and you can't describe who you are by telling a story or by getting properties of who you are.

891
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:58,040
And the question is: what's the phenomena of that?

892
01:31:58,040 --> 01:32:06,680
And the whole thing hinges on moods, only it goes by very fast.

893
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:09,400
Let's see if I can find it here.

894
01:32:09,721 --> 01:32:14,040
Well, maybe I should find it over here.

895
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:15,560
No, but do you remember that?

896
01:32:15,561 --> 01:32:26,200
Abraham Heidegger just at one point says that what you do is a question of your disposingness.

897
01:32:26,441 --> 01:32:27,000
Here it is.

898
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Okay, 330, the end of the top paragraph.

899
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,040
It's about thrown, being itself.

900
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:37,400
Throwiness, however, does not lie behind it.

901
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:38,520
Let's have to back up.

902
01:32:38,521 --> 01:32:52,520
An existent as existence, Dasein never comes back behind its throwness in such a way that it might first release this that it is that has to be from its being itself and lead it into the there.

903
01:32:52,521 --> 01:33:00,921
Thrownness, however, does not lie behind it as some event which has happened to Dasein, salted, befallen it, fallen, and so forth.

904
01:33:00,921 --> 01:33:06,360
On the contrary, as long as Dasein is, Dasein has care, is constantly its that it is.

905
01:33:06,521 --> 01:33:12,040
All this is very obscure, but I think I know what he's getting at.

906
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:20,841
It has been delivered over, and as such, it can exist solely as the entity which it is, and as this entity to which it has been thus delivered over.

907
01:33:20,841 --> 01:33:42,080
It is in its existing, the basis of its ability to be, although it is not laid, this is the crucial sentence, although it has not laid the basis itself, it reposes in the weight of it, which is made manifest through it as a burden of Dasein's mood.

908
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:45,681
That's the only mention of it, but that's the crucial issue.

909
01:33:45,681 --> 01:33:58,960
The crucial thing is to say, finally, you are defined by what matters to you in your world and what draws you to respond to it in your world.

910
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:10,000
And you can't decide what matters to you or ultimately even, I think, resist what matters to you because it's more basic than that.

911
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:21,280
It just shows up as these things are to be done and these things show up as to be avoided, and this situation shows up as to be taken a risk in, and so forth.

912
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:26,240
It's not as if there's anything else you can say about it.

913
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:28,960
I want to see if now I want to read what.

914
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:39,921
And I like what Ruth does when he says from Merlot Ponte, well, let me start at the bottom of page six.

915
01:34:40,881 --> 01:34:42,641
Heidegger provides the key.

916
01:34:42,641 --> 01:34:48,240
We've seen that everyday Dasein pre-reflexively projects upon possibilities, but which possibilities?

917
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:55,120
We need to examine Heidegger's conception of the Finnliche, that is, disposedness and attunement.

918
01:34:55,120 --> 01:35:03,280
With these, Heidegger means to capture the way in which things and possibilities are always already matter to Dasein in some particular way.

919
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:11,841
Then he quotes: Dasein, as essentially disposed, has already got itself into definite possibilities.

920
01:35:12,881 --> 01:35:18,440
Moreover, by way of having an attunement, Dasein sees possibilities in terms of which it is.

921
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:26,120
These possibilities, he then quotes Marilo-Ponty, polarize the perceptual field and the field of action.

922
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:49,881
That means we're just called to do certain things at the level of basketball playing and soccer playing, which Marlot Ponty talks about, and at the level of how we relate to others, and at the level of how we relate to our vocation, which we don't, the vocation is much too conceptual and linguistic way to talk about it, and the world is polarized.

923
01:35:49,881 --> 01:36:09,400
I mean, looking back on it and so forth, I can say my world is polarized by being a teacher, but it is in fact, but I don't, but I'm, the way things show up as mattering and how I'm called to be a teacher is sort of day by day, different things matter to me and make me happy and make me unhappy and so forth.

924
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:14,921
So that's the first thing I want to talk about.

925
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:32,440
Is this a devastating criticism of a whole conceptualist view of what it is to be a self and what it is to, and what ultimate requirements there are on acting?

926
01:36:33,561 --> 01:36:37,400
And remember, the clue is conscience is silent.

927
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:49,801
That's just the opposite of saying conscience is drawing us to do something or other particular that we can describe, even if it's very abstract, like be autonomous.

928
01:36:49,921 --> 01:37:02,240
You can't even you can't say consciousness is requiring you to do that because that would require, according to the way Heidegger's setting it up, that you could be lucid about the background out of which to act.

929
01:37:02,561 --> 01:37:08,000
And the background has got to be, remember, I read the passage last time in the origin of the work of art.

930
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:13,120
Something unclear, something murky and unsettled, he says there.

931
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:15,600
That's probably not the best way to put it.

932
01:37:15,601 --> 01:37:42,721
I think the best way to put it is that the way mattering polarizes your world is so pervasive and so ungeneral and undescribable that you just are what you always Dasein is what he does, you know, or in this case, and I want to add now.

933
01:37:42,721 --> 01:37:44,320
Heidegger wants to add now.

934
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:47,680
And what Dasein does depends on what matters to it.

935
01:37:47,681 --> 01:37:51,520
And what matters to it isn't anything that you can say anything about.

936
01:37:51,521 --> 01:37:54,480
You can only and you can hardly even see it.

937
01:37:54,481 --> 01:37:56,801
It's so basic.

938
01:37:56,801 --> 01:38:06,640
And I guess the bottom line is: all acting is acting on a background that you can be lucid about with his basic thesis.

939
01:38:06,641 --> 01:38:09,600
Now, does that matter?

940
01:38:09,601 --> 01:38:36,480
I mean, I'm looking at Eugene because I know that he, I mean, the main enemy I think now living is Professor Korsgaard at Harvard, who's Kantian, who I think would deny all this, although maybe it's not, maybe there's no incompatibility between all this claiming of Heidegger of the silence of conscience and the mind get-behind your throwiness and the way it's all finally bottoms out in mattering and disposing of this.

941
01:38:36,561 --> 01:38:37,681
Is there a conflict?

942
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:41,721
People have all conventions with him as in part.

943
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:43,160
There's active reasoning.

944
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:45,480
The fact is that he gets back and again.

945
01:38:45,561 --> 01:38:46,681
Get out of there, you can't be.

946
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:49,080
Is it silent or does it say something?

947
01:38:50,761 --> 01:38:51,720
Oh, okay.

948
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:53,320
Okay, that's a disagreement.

949
01:38:53,320 --> 01:39:04,360
That there's some content in this calling that you have, that you cannot, that is imperative, and categorially imperative, not just hypothetically imperative.

950
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:07,400
There is such a call, and they share that, absolutely.

951
01:39:08,601 --> 01:39:14,520
That the calling can be put into words and put into the whole critique of practical reason and Kant and so forth.

952
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:17,080
That's what Heidegger denies.

953
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:28,921
And the denial is really a story about whether you act on a background which you can't make into a foreground, and that's got to do with your throwiness and disposiveness.

954
01:39:28,921 --> 01:39:32,841
The silence finally turns out to be.

955
01:39:32,841 --> 01:39:49,720
I think Heidegger has it already, and that when he says that you repose in the weight of your mood, and Ruth tells it out pretty well, it turns out that the final level of mattering is something you just can't put into words and you can't sort of dictate to what it's going to be.

956
01:39:49,721 --> 01:39:56,761
And it tells you who you are and what your world is in a way that you have to just do it.

957
01:39:56,761 --> 01:39:57,881
You can't say it.

958
01:39:57,881 --> 01:40:00,360
That's the story, I think.

959
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:00,841
What?

960
01:40:01,481 --> 01:40:02,841
The final level of mattering is mood.

961
01:40:02,841 --> 01:40:06,921
That's the pattern of that little line I is what disposive mood?

962
01:40:06,921 --> 01:40:07,881
Is mood, yes.

963
01:40:07,881 --> 01:40:09,400
Mood, that's what he says.

964
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:14,360
We seem to use all the tangents about how you're always writing inner mood and pretty horrors of you.

965
01:40:14,681 --> 01:40:18,040
Because that's the only way you can sometimes be able to do it.

966
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:23,320
And what would lead you to do that would just be another mood, I think.

967
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:24,681
That's the bottom line for him.

968
01:40:26,761 --> 01:40:28,841
The contents might be calling you.

969
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:37,200
The regress is the crucial point.

970
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:55,761
For him, there's nothing sort of beyond or behind the fact that there are moods and there are moods that are calling you to get out of moods so you can use moods against your moods, but that the world is always insofar as anything matters and you do anything, it's always because you're always already in a mood.

971
01:40:55,761 --> 01:41:00,721
Is that the conscience really doesn't call you to alter that anyway?

972
01:41:00,801 --> 01:41:05,120
Um it's the other thing, they're always ready to move certain things, but you don't matter anything.

973
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:08,240
But the content calls you to counter the mood you're always taking more.

974
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:12,240
Well, the first question, does he call you silently or does it say don't be grumpy?

975
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:26,721
But it's time to account for the mood, you've been trying to but it's there's there's a purpose there, not just taking over the mood when things matter to you, but you're there's a big basis here.

976
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:29,440
I I don't remember where he says that.

977
01:41:29,441 --> 01:41:37,280
I mean, I remember he says you can only get rid of a mood by way of a counter mood, but where does it say that anything is calling you to get rid of any mood?

978
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:41,841
There's an interpretation of the content of the whole content.

979
01:41:41,841 --> 01:41:44,000
And whereas you're saying that it doesn't have much.

980
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:51,680
It what matters to you that the mood presently reads the Finnish tag is disposiness in the jargon of last semester, yeah.

981
01:41:54,721 --> 01:41:59,841
It tells you not just to take over the mood that you're you find yourself in, but rather to deploy.

982
01:42:00,561 --> 01:42:01,521
Well, it's true.

983
01:42:01,681 --> 01:42:03,040
I I see the point.

984
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:04,400
Let's let people talk about it.

985
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:06,801
But first, him, because he hasn't said anything.

986
01:42:06,841 --> 01:42:11,040
Well, we do have a capacity, a sort of small capacity to change our mood.

987
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:13,960
We can go to a party and hope that it'll change.

988
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:14,680
Really?

989
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:17,240
That's not what Heidegger thinks.

990
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:21,641
I think Heidegger thinks that, oh, well, or Pozak or something.

991
01:42:21,641 --> 01:42:23,560
No, but that's not fair.

992
01:42:23,561 --> 01:42:24,040
I mean, he's.

993
01:42:24,841 --> 01:42:31,960
I want to point out that you're in the negative contact are there own motivations to evolve, like lightning blocks be around.

994
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:34,280
You're not motivated to reveal that there is no.

995
01:42:35,881 --> 01:42:46,280
I think Heidegger thinks that your feelings are somehow not motivated.

996
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:53,561
They just come over you like an atmosphere, and they are global so that you don't have any place outside of them.

997
01:42:53,561 --> 01:43:03,160
When everything looks depressing, then there's no way to do anything about it in a Heidegger picture because anything you drag in to help will be also depressing.

998
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:05,881
And if you're taking co-op, that'll be depressing.

999
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:24,360
Well, yes, but it's well, okay, but then Heidegger just isn't in, doesn't think either, and I can't tell whether Heidegger's going to just deny that or he's going to say, but even whether you want to modify your behavior is already part of the mood.

1000
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:29,641
And if you're in a sullen mood, then you want to be sullen.

1001
01:43:29,641 --> 01:43:34,120
It isn't as if you would like to be fearful and friendly.

1002
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:41,000
It covers everything, and it seems to reveal, I guess the point is, the Muslims reveal the way things really are.

1003
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:51,560
And if they're really the sort of full of brightness and opportunity, then everything is full of brightness and opportunity, and nothing will pull you down.

1004
01:43:51,561 --> 01:43:57,320
And if they're full of sort of darkness and gloom, then everything is full of darkness and gloom.

1005
01:43:57,320 --> 01:44:01,921
And you can't just say, boy, is it unpleasant being darkness and gloomy and cheer up?

1006
01:43:58,761 --> 01:44:03,200
Now, maybe there are techniques.

1007
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:04,240
I'm not going to deny it.

1008
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:04,881
I don't know.

1009
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:09,280
Heidegger's wrong that there are techniques for getting you out of your mood.

1010
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:12,720
And you can go to a therapist and you can certainly you can take a pill.

1011
01:44:12,721 --> 01:44:20,320
But let's just, for the time being anyway, let's just understand it as any what anybody can do on their own without therapists and without pills.

1012
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:23,440
Oh, you've talked and you've talked out and you've talked.

1013
01:44:23,601 --> 01:44:26,240
Anybody want to say something who hasn't said anything?

1014
01:44:26,561 --> 01:44:27,681
If there's any why?

1015
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:32,960
We're not without the philosophy terms on the videos and all the learning.

1016
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:35,040
Well, but there isn't anything.

1017
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:38,721
If we're already so in a mood, why isn't it completely deterministic?

1018
01:44:38,721 --> 01:44:40,801
Okay, let me think about that.

1019
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:48,400
It's not deterministic, surely, in some kind of science determinism way.

1020
01:44:48,721 --> 01:44:56,000
It does take away your freedom to decide what matters to you.

1021
01:44:56,641 --> 01:45:03,200
And I don't know whether Andy, is that deterministic?

1022
01:45:05,921 --> 01:45:11,440
I think the answer somehow is calling it deterministic doesn't help any.

1023
01:45:11,521 --> 01:45:16,641
It's something like saying, well, you should be able to choose your mood and look at this you can't.

1024
01:45:16,801 --> 01:45:25,761
Mood just work that way, and you're never sort of outside the mood where you're freely deciding what mood to be in, according to Heidegger.

1025
01:45:25,761 --> 01:45:26,801
That's your throwin' it.

1026
01:45:27,841 --> 01:45:31,360
It's saying deterministic, how about saying it's your throwiness?

1027
01:45:31,921 --> 01:45:33,520
That's his way of putting it.

1028
01:45:33,521 --> 01:45:38,160
And it just makes it doesn't sound like somehow your molecules are driving you to be a certain way.

1029
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:39,921
It's not that kind of determinism.

1030
01:45:39,921 --> 01:45:41,520
He's not interested in that.

1031
01:45:41,521 --> 01:45:46,040
That there is something he calls thrownness, and that you can't get behind it.

1032
01:45:46,360 --> 01:45:58,280
And that means that you can't step outside your global moods and choose other ones, though sometimes you can do something to help.

1033
01:45:58,681 --> 01:46:07,160
The general idea is that your whole space is polarized by this by mattering.

1034
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:24,440
And we were having this with Tyler, there's no way Dasein can get to a point where it hasn't always already taken on some mattering or other and decide or choose which mattering to take on.

1035
01:46:24,921 --> 01:46:25,881
That's the point.

1036
01:46:26,441 --> 01:46:29,881
I'm glad we're having it because it's a strong claim.

1037
01:46:29,881 --> 01:46:31,960
I think it's time to give us true.

1038
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:35,960
I think that that's sort of the logic of mattering.

1039
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:51,160
That thing that there is always already a way that things matter, and it's only on the basis of that that we can sort of to some extent change the way things matter, but always from within the way things matter to us now.

1040
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:51,960
You look worried.

1041
01:46:53,881 --> 01:46:54,601
Good question.

1042
01:46:54,601 --> 01:46:56,761
Why does it show that you're the silent?

1043
01:46:56,761 --> 01:47:10,761
It's the way that it is so pervasively, the mattering is such a pervasive background that it's invisible to the people in it.

1044
01:47:10,761 --> 01:47:14,360
And I think unnameable, but I don't know whether it's unnameable.

1045
01:47:14,681 --> 01:47:17,560
I think it's unnameable because it's again so concrete.

1046
01:47:17,561 --> 01:47:19,960
I mean, you can say general things to yourself.

1047
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:34,160
I'm a grumpy person, but you're certainly so uniquely grumpy in the general generality of that basis is something that you can't say anything illuminating about it.

1048
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:35,921
What do you think?

1049
01:47:35,921 --> 01:47:37,440
Why is it kind of?

1050
01:47:37,441 --> 01:47:38,881
I still have a conscience.

1051
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:40,480
Ah, good question.

1052
01:47:40,481 --> 01:47:48,881
So if your conscience is calling you silently, what's it calling you to do if you're already always already totally in this mattering thrown situation?

1053
01:47:48,881 --> 01:47:50,560
Wait a second, let me worry about that.

1054
01:47:50,561 --> 01:47:54,881
What's the crucial passage that we're trying to understand?

1055
01:47:55,761 --> 01:48:12,881
It's correct that there's something funny going on there about because it's calling you to something, and yet, tell me where the physics are reposing in the weight of it, which I found once that I've lost again.

1056
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:17,200
Okay, 330.

1057
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:18,400
Yeah, let's look at that again.

1058
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:20,080
This is the crucial passage.

1059
01:48:20,801 --> 01:48:23,600
This is the throne that's called.

1060
01:48:25,521 --> 01:48:39,761
It's delivered over and such can exist solely as the entity which it is, and as this entity which has been delivered over, it is in its existing, the basis of its ability to be.

1061
01:48:39,761 --> 01:48:49,040
Although it has not laid that basis itself, it reposes in the weight of it, which is made manifest as the burden of mood.

1062
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:50,960
And let me just do the next paragraph too.

1063
01:48:51,441 --> 01:48:53,761
How is Dazine the throne basis?

1064
01:48:53,761 --> 01:48:57,680
Only that it projects itself upon possibilities into which it's been thrown.

1065
01:48:57,681 --> 01:49:00,960
The self, which as such, has to lay the basis for itself.

1066
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:04,801
It never, when I college, get the basis into its power.

1067
01:49:04,801 --> 01:49:09,681
And yet, as existing, it must take over the basis, the being of basic.

1068
01:49:09,681 --> 01:49:15,240
To be its own throwing basis is the ability to be, which is the issue of where.

1069
01:49:13,681 --> 01:49:16,841
Well, that is sort of illuminating.

1070
01:49:13,761 --> 01:49:18,681
I mean, we're being called to take it over.

1071
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,360
What does that mean?

1072
01:49:20,681 --> 01:49:21,960
I don't know.

1073
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:23,400
Let's go on.

1074
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:28,280
Being a basis that isn't existing and throwing Dasein constantly lags behind its possibilities.

1075
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:32,120
It never exists before its basis, but only from it, and as this basis.

1076
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:34,520
That's what I talk about, always on the background.

1077
01:49:34,521 --> 01:49:38,681
Thus, being a basis means never to have power over one's ownness from the ground up.

1078
01:49:38,681 --> 01:49:41,160
It does not belong, say, to central feelings.

1079
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:42,841
That's the nullity.

1080
01:49:43,881 --> 01:49:47,400
In itself, being a basis is a nullity of itself.

1081
01:49:47,721 --> 01:49:50,841
Nullity doesn't seem like, oh, it's the.

1082
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:56,521
And being itself, Dasein is as a self, the entity which has been thrown.

1083
01:49:56,521 --> 01:50:05,000
It's been released from its basu, not to itself, but to itself, as to be as this basis.

1084
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:12,040
The question we're asking ourselves is: what is conscience calling you to do?

1085
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:25,721
When it's calling you to somehow live in that melody, that is, to accept, or if he puts it on the next page, to accept definitely, being guilty.

1086
01:50:25,721 --> 01:50:37,801
That was just, we just read the phenomenon of being guilty, namely sort of indebtedness for what you can't get behind and is the basis of everything you can do.

1087
01:50:39,721 --> 01:50:46,841
And that melody is something at the bottom is not something which emerges in Dasein occasionally.

1088
01:50:47,160 --> 01:50:50,841
It's not something you can eliminate and so forth.

1089
01:50:50,841 --> 01:50:55,160
Now, anybody got an answer to what Eugene's question?

1090
01:50:55,160 --> 01:51:01,280
I mean, what is consciousness calling you silently to do?

1091
01:51:02,721 --> 01:51:06,000
There you are in the mattering, and so, yeah?

1092
01:51:06,641 --> 01:51:09,200
So much depending on what you want to do.

1093
01:51:09,761 --> 01:51:11,040
Well, and what is it calling?

1094
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:13,040
What is the how it's calling?

1095
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:14,801
The care.

1096
01:51:14,801 --> 01:51:16,240
You should care.

1097
01:51:16,561 --> 01:51:17,280
I don't know.

1098
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:18,240
Are you going to try something?

1099
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:40,080
So it's calling the mattering yeah, but the point is, but if it's already, never mind that though, the basic thing is, if it's already in the background and always in the background, and you can't ever get outside it or behind it, then what can you do that you're being called to do?

1100
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:42,240
And that's what I say, that that's the question.

1101
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:43,360
I take it, right?

1102
01:51:44,641 --> 01:51:45,280
Really?

1103
01:51:45,601 --> 01:51:47,761
Okay, I'll accept that.

1104
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:48,320
Go ahead.

1105
01:51:54,000 --> 01:52:18,400
There remains the fact that this contact is moved is ungrounded, and anxiety can still arise, even if you're told it's called context, even though you know telling yourself basically there is that the anxiety is somehow a more priority than that, because it it can still take you up even when you're I think you're on the right track.

1106
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:48,520
I'm not sure whether I agree with it or not, but it looks like Heidegger's saying what anxiety is calling you to do is face the anxiety of being in always in a mood and never in control of your own destiny, never autonom never can be autonomous, okay it if you look at it this way, because the most basic thing about who you are and what you do is something you can't do and can't even find words to express and conceptualize.

1107
01:52:48,841 --> 01:53:01,720
If that makes you anxious, then you could be called to face up to that anxiety as opposed to fleeing it into rules, into giving a narrative about who you are, and so forth.

1108
01:53:01,721 --> 01:53:06,761
It helps to see the temptation of the opposite.

1109
01:53:06,761 --> 01:53:16,600
So at least we can say this, I think, and this is Eugene's question in order to my question, whoever it was, at least you're being called to not do something.

1110
01:53:16,921 --> 01:53:26,520
You're called not to do what one does, not to see, not to find principles and standards on which to justify and figure out what to do.

1111
01:53:26,521 --> 01:53:27,881
That's fine.

1112
01:53:27,881 --> 01:53:38,120
So you're called to face the anxiety of the groundlessness of it, that you can't get behind your throwness.

1113
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:41,881
You're not called to not get behind your throwness.

1114
01:53:41,881 --> 01:53:43,320
That's just your structure.

1115
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:51,801
What they're called to do is face up to that structure and not cover up that structure.

1116
01:53:51,801 --> 01:53:53,721
Yeah, okay, I think that's helpful.

1117
01:53:53,721 --> 01:53:55,400
I mean, maybe you don't look healthy.

1118
01:53:56,280 --> 01:53:57,801
You don't look healthy.

1119
01:53:57,801 --> 01:53:58,200
What?

1120
01:53:58,521 --> 01:54:02,040
If you just say you're being called not to do something, that's fine.

1121
01:54:02,280 --> 01:54:04,120
If I get over here, you could talk louder.

1122
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:06,681
You're being called not to do something.

1123
01:54:06,681 --> 01:54:07,560
That's fine.

1124
01:54:07,801 --> 01:54:09,080
That's true.

1125
01:54:09,561 --> 01:54:10,040
That's right.

1126
01:54:10,360 --> 01:54:11,320
How does that happen?

1127
01:54:12,120 --> 01:54:13,881
It's not just a call not to do something.

1128
01:54:14,441 --> 01:54:16,520
But now I know how we can reconcile each other.

1129
01:54:16,521 --> 01:54:25,480
It's not a cause to modify your mood, which is how it looked last time, because that's just, as you say, in the circle of of some other mood on which you want to modify the mood.

1130
01:54:25,481 --> 01:54:37,680
It's this meta-thing which you were trying to get at, which we're being called to do is not to cover up, but rather to face up to this throwing condition.

1131
01:54:37,681 --> 01:54:43,761
To not think that God tells you what to do or reason tells you what to do or anything like that.

1132
01:54:43,761 --> 01:54:49,360
You're you're being called not to do the the the Gothaman mood.

1133
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:50,160
Is that right?

1134
01:54:50,160 --> 01:54:53,520
And that is something that apparently you can resist.

1135
01:54:53,521 --> 01:55:03,360
You can uh you're being called to hold on to anxiety, I guess, and face up to your unsettledness.

1136
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:07,681
And uh you can't do that by your willpower.

1137
01:55:07,681 --> 01:55:09,761
This is a different sort of puzzle.

1138
01:55:09,761 --> 01:55:12,721
But uh but it is certainly what you're being called to do.

1139
01:55:12,801 --> 01:55:15,360
You're probably you're being called to stop fleeing.

1140
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:17,280
Fleeing isn't a mood, I don't think.

1141
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:21,120
So that's why it isn't as if you can say, well, I'll just dictate, I won't have that mood.

1142
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:34,480
No, because this fleeing is taking up the way one does things with standards and so forth and using them to get out of the anxiety of unsettledness.

1143
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:57,520
And I take it you I don't know why exactly, but Heidegger thinks you could be called in a and the silent call is stop fleeing anxiety and stop doing what one does when listen to what you are being called to do.

1144
01:55:57,681 --> 01:56:00,320
But I mean that's the not the basic level.

1145
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:03,841
The basic level you're being called is to stop fleeing.

1146
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:06,320
I think that is how it seems to Heidegger.

1147
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:11,680
What you certainly can't be called to do is to have a right move instead of a wrong mood or to change your mood.

1148
01:56:11,681 --> 01:56:13,960
I think that's supposed to be the thrownness.

1149
01:56:14,601 --> 01:56:15,000
Right.

1150
01:56:15,080 --> 01:56:15,881
All right.

1151
01:56:16,120 --> 01:56:17,641
There are monsters of moods.

1152
01:56:17,641 --> 01:56:18,440
What's the only mood?

1153
01:56:13,761 --> 01:56:19,080
A mood.

1154
01:56:19,240 --> 01:56:20,600
Is fleeing a mood?

1155
01:56:20,921 --> 01:56:23,080
It must result from a mood that one is in.

1156
01:56:23,641 --> 01:56:25,720
It is a reaction to a mood.

1157
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:42,280
What it's not that you're told you're supposed to flee moods or change moods of a normal sort of mood, uh, where I think of something like you're being happy, being grumpy, being whatever.

1158
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:50,921
Uh the what they're being called to do is it really doesn't have much to do with mo moods.

1159
01:56:51,160 --> 01:56:51,960
That's a funny thing.

1160
01:56:51,960 --> 01:56:54,360
I mean, this is your your moods are your throwness.

1161
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:56,520
Your moods are your facticity.

1162
01:56:56,521 --> 01:57:05,801
The call of conscience is to accept your thrownness and your facticity and that you can't get behind it.

1163
01:57:05,801 --> 01:57:16,680
That means to accept the unsettledness of being a a Dasein and not flee, I'm just saying the same thing over and over, into the one.

1164
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,560
I don't I'm I'm not disagreeing with you or not.

1165
01:57:19,561 --> 01:57:20,360
I don't know.

1166
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:22,040
Right.

1167
01:57:22,040 --> 01:57:24,360
Okay, well then but then we just get back again.

1168
01:57:24,360 --> 01:57:25,881
Eugene, you want to say something about that?

1169
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:34,440
You say something that's going to have an aspect in all of the different parts of it, so then I just it's probably going to be a projection.

1170
01:57:34,601 --> 01:57:38,841
You'll have a different discourse because you all articulate things differently, you all have a different mood.

1171
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:49,960
I think that might be okay, but I think w part of what you're getting at is that whatever it is that the entire consciousness is possible, I could also just be a thoroughly part of being this whole life.

1172
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:53,400
We're completely thrown and we can't get behind it at all.

1173
01:57:54,040 --> 01:57:55,400
Then you have this problem of what?

1174
01:57:55,400 --> 01:57:56,440
How can there be any conscience?

1175
01:57:56,441 --> 01:57:57,560
How can you ever be changed?

1176
01:57:58,761 --> 01:58:01,040
Right, but how can I even be involved?

1177
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:10,000
Well, uh, we get means we can't get a by with the negativeness of consciousness calling you to stop fleeing.

1178
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,841
And the name is possible, Mr.

1179
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:13,040
Here's a picture.

1180
01:58:13,120 --> 01:58:16,400
You're already doing something that's calling you to modify the negative.

1181
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:17,841
Oh dear, oh dear.

1182
01:58:17,841 --> 01:58:20,641
Well, um, um, uh, wait a minute, what time is it?

1183
01:58:20,641 --> 01:58:23,280
It's it's awesome I I want to hear everybody.

1184
01:58:23,441 --> 01:58:25,921
You I told you you couldn't talk, so you can now.

1185
01:58:26,160 --> 01:58:31,040
I think all time will be out of the mirror is by the false conscience, but we're not necessarily changing them.

1186
01:58:31,040 --> 01:58:32,561
Like we're not going from happy to that.

1187
01:58:32,561 --> 01:58:34,881
It's not like completely modification like that.

1188
01:58:34,881 --> 01:58:38,400
It's just that Paul Hons is always asking us to be more authentic.

1189
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:39,600
To do what, too?

1190
01:58:39,761 --> 01:58:42,960
Paul Conscience is always going to be more powerful than our own willpower.

1191
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:50,240
Like by that, I mean try to will myself to be happy, but it won't work the same way as like Paul Conscience, hey, I need to choose something.

1192
01:58:51,441 --> 01:58:53,921
The conscious is calling you to be authentic.

1193
01:58:53,921 --> 01:58:56,881
That doesn't seem to be having a certain mood.

1194
01:58:57,200 --> 01:59:06,320
It seems to be having a certain stand on the mood or or experience of the mood or way of dealing with moods.

1195
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:11,761
And it seems to be, I think, expressing that you can't understand them.

1196
01:59:11,761 --> 01:59:13,440
You can't put them into words.

1197
01:59:13,441 --> 01:59:15,280
You can't get behind them.
