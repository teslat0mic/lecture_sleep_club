00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
So today we're going back to talking about death.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:16,160
And it's, you know, how you're getting used to it, I hope, sort of important, but hard to put this back of the page numbers because of the way I've cut it up in different forms.

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,520
But it ought to begin to already impress you that we can talk about.

4
00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:32,079
We've talked about guilt and we talked about resoluteness without talking about death, although the death chapter is prior to them.

5
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:41,680
So that Heidegger's going to have to go through the awkward move of next time bringing back the story of death, but put it again after guilt.

6
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,080
The way the book is actually written, we're supposed to have done death already, then now, and then guilt.

7
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,679
But that's not how we're reading it.

8
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:57,280
So sometimes you've got to just keep in mind that we've done guilt, because that's the past, and that gets you resoluteness.

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:08,600
And today we're going to do death, and then next time, Heidegger's finally got to do the job, which he had to do anyway, but not in that crazy order.

10
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:38,119
Get the resoluteness together with anticipation, that is, get guilt together with death, and get anticipatory resoluteness as the way of life that a Dasein lives when it is authentic, that is, when it manifests in what it does transparently, or Hoagland has a nice new term, I just realized, loosedly what it is to eat them as well.

11
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:51,400
And Hoagland says, and I think this right, Heidegger uses the term explicitly, Australich, but that makes it sound as if you could say what it is and sort of have a credo for being authentic.

12
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,479
And that's not how it is at all.

13
00:01:53,479 --> 00:02:01,559
It's a way of understanding, that is coping with yourself and other Daseins and the world.

14
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:10,919
But you can do that lucidly, meaning, and now we'll have a word from Kierkegaard, transparently, which is Kierkegaard's way of avoiding it.

15
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:19,000
When you say lucidly or transparently, you don't mean something that you can put into propositional form and state explicitly.

16
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:21,800
So I think the parenthetical.

17
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:29,800
So next time, we will get to the way you live at a formal level.

18
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:33,160
Of course, everybody has to do it their own specific way.

19
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:52,039
But the general shape of the life which you live, if you manifest transparently or lucidly in your activity, what a Dasein, what Dasein essentially is, instead of covering up, which you can do, what Dasein essentially is.

20
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,480
And Dasein, what is Dasein essentially?

21
00:02:54,479 --> 00:03:08,239
Well, it's the throwing, projecting, falling being whom I think, although it isn't so clear in Being in Time, the main job description is being a world disclosure.

22
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:19,359
But we won't talk much about that unless we talk about Sarah White's introduction to the paper I put on the website.

23
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:20,879
So there's a kind of problem.

24
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,000
I might as well just find out now what you want to do.

25
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:25,039
I'm open to.

26
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:31,039
I mean, there are just two different something or others on the table, though not utterly unrelated to each other.

27
00:03:31,039 --> 00:04:00,640
Namely, the assignment that we read for this time about death as treated in Being and Time, and my paper that I put on the website, which tries to sort of present the comments on death and being in time in a broader context following Farrell White, in which the death of cultures and the death of understandings of being plays a more important role than the death of individuals.

28
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,599
I take it.

29
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,880
Here's my proposal.

30
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:09,439
First, I talk a little while about our assignment, and then we discuss that.

31
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:15,760
And then if there's still time, we discuss how many read the piece I put on the website.

32
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,760
Not more, not even half.

33
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,560
Okay, well, then, and you don't have to.

34
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:35,280
I mean, I think it's really illuminating her book, and therefore, my talking about her book is also really illuminating, but it's not necessary for understanding what goes on in Being and Time.

35
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,119
It's more like it prevents certain misunderstandings of what is going on in being in time, but we can prevent them anyway.

36
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:44,199
Does anybody got any want to say anyone?

37
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,640
Is there any better way to do it?

38
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:52,280
To me, wish I could just go back and forth between them, but I'm not, I don't think you're able to do it given what you've read.

39
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,720
I don't think I'm able to do it just keeping too many things open on my desktop.

40
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,999
I've cracked.

41
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,879
So let's go to this.

42
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:14,439
Starting with a running start, that is a quick review of last time, because it's so important to keep from getting lost in the death chapter.

43
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:18,440
Much, much more easy to get lost in than the guilt chapter.

44
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:43,079
But on the same grounds, it's important to realize that when you do this kind of hermeneutic understanding, that is, you want to get at the essence of death and guilt, and you want to do it by sort of getting an overall picture of Zazine in which these various components fit together in a holistic way and then reinforce each other.

45
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,079
The method you have to use is formal indication.

46
00:05:47,080 --> 00:06:00,040
That means you have to start with not only isolatable components like death and guilt separately and resoluteness and anticipatory resoluteness separately and finally put them together.

47
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,920
That's part of what makes it hard.

48
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:25,280
But what makes it even harder is if you do formal indication, you have to start with an understanding of whatever you're going to be talking about, in this case, in the last time, guilt, an understanding of it which is wrong, which is a cover-up, which is not a distortion, it's an understatement.

49
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:33,680
It's a 180-degree wrong denial of exactly what death is or guilt is.

50
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,840
We saw it last time, and I want to remind you.

51
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:58,080
So, guilt normally means that you're responsible for some bad thing you've done, or that you, or you're responsible for obeying the laws and standards and principles of your society, and you've broken the law, you owe something, you have to go to prison to make up for it, and so forth.

52
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:06,560
All that talk, and of course, conscience too, tells you what the laws are and tells you when you've broken them, the moral principles and so forth.

53
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,279
All that isn't just wrong about ontological guilt.

54
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,639
I mean, Heidi's not going to tell you that's wrong about the ordinary meaning of guilt.

55
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,560
That's a good analysis.

56
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:29,040
I didn't do it elegantly, but you could make a good analysis of the ordinary meaning of guilt based on how it looks when you just look at the phenomenon of first sight.

57
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,479
That's what I was just saying.

58
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:38,800
Guilt is indebtedness and owing something and obeying rules and so forth.

59
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,360
You have to start with that, because that's how we normally take it.

60
00:07:47,359 --> 00:08:08,840
But you know when you start that if you work it out, you'll discover that ontological guilt, as opposed to sort of common sense understanding of guilt, the real structure that the word guilt is pointing to, that the guilt is pointing to, the word guilt is pointing to, the real phenomenon is buried and covered up.

61
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:15,960
And moreover, and this is something I think Heidegger really thinks, but he doesn't say it, except more in fact against African.

62
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:33,320
They wouldn't know how to open to it right away, that it's not just covered up, but it's a motivated cover-up that is trying to exactly deny what guilt and death really ontological as ontological structures of God's sign off.

63
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:38,200
And therefore, the wrong answer is a clue to the right answer.

64
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:51,960
Because if you can see that, if you can understand what guilt is denied, namely that there is no basis for what you ought to do, and conscience doesn't give you rules and goes when you do wrong thing.

65
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,560
Conscience is silent.

66
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,800
It's a silent kind of call.

67
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:20,280
You can see that putting a voice into conscience, putting guilt and debtiness, responsibility, and so forth into the notion of guilt is precisely the cover-up that there aren't any world guidelines and you don't know anybody, anything specific and so forth.

68
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,399
That's going to be a clue to the right answer.

69
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,239
I'll say this one more time.

70
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:30,360
It's the more semblance, the more proof or something like that, Heidegger says.

71
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,119
I'll have to find a line that I see as I talk that I should have looked for.

72
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:39,840
But anyway, the point is, you've got to see that.

73
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:45,239
We're going to be told a story about death, which is dead wrong, you might say.

74
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:47,320
Okay, well, you want to say something.

75
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,880
Well, I didn't say there's nothing.

76
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:49,439
Oh, wow.

77
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:52,720
We had this.

78
00:09:50,040 --> 00:10:07,360
No, we nearly, I'll see you've got to think about this whether I want to we might just think back into a discussion that was the first meeting, but I'll see if I can say something that doesn't start a whole discussion again.

79
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:15,680
Heidegger thinks there are wrong ways of behaving, ways to cover up what it is to be Dasein.

80
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:27,040
But those ways of behaving might well be arranged in the moral law and doing whatever you do in a way that you can generalize it.

81
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,799
What's the word in the Kantians use?

82
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,159
Universalizing.

83
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:40,399
I mean, if you're doing stuff that's universalizable, that's certainly a clue that it's wrong.

84
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,639
Because remember that the pharonomist responds to the unique situation.

85
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:53,840
So Heidegger has plenty to say about all the wrong ways of wanting in order to cover up the true structure of Dase.

86
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:02,799
But I'm trying to think: is there anything I can say about well, you can say very formal things like Dasein responds to their unique situation.

87
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:09,520
Well, consciousness calls Dasein to respond to the unique situation, but it's a silent call that doesn't then tell you anything.

88
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:24,320
And it doesn't say three people's means, names and neighbors' means, or love your neighbor, or have them do unto them as you would have them do unto you, or more specific things like vote when when an election comes around.

89
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,640
It doesn't say anything like any of that.

90
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:33,759
So it's in the end, I don't know whether this thing gives you moral guidelines or not.

91
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:42,359
I mean, if let's say it tells you a wrong way to behave when you're diasaring, it tells you in a very abstract way the right way to behave when you're data design.

92
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:48,440
It gives you no specific guidance of how to act in specific situations, according to Heidegger.

93
00:11:48,759 --> 00:12:02,760
And if conscience is telling you, this is what put it in the most provocative way, if conscience is telling you what to do and what not to do, you can be sure that that's a cover-up because that's telling you general things.

94
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:06,040
And that's not that those aren't better than nothing.

95
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:24,679
I mean, it may be better to be told the general thing that you should help me to kill them, but it doesn't help you really know whether when somebody asks for money on the street in Berkeley you should give them money so each fake is is unique.

96
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,239
Now there's something one more thing I want to say about it.

97
00:12:29,080 --> 00:13:03,800
Okay, yes, so so you could be sure, back to your question, if conscience is telling you rules and principles that are universalizable and rational or based on revelation or based on human nature or or based on the way your parents socialized you, if your consciousness is giving you ways advice about how to behave and telling you when you're doing wrong in any of those ways, you can be sure that it's covering up, not doing uh what what you should be doing.

98
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:09,479
So yeah, but I'm trying to think clearly, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't do what one does.

99
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:16,200
I mean, it's better to do what one does in your culture than to do outrageous things that one doesn't do at all, I guess.

100
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:22,600
Though, in the back of my mind, I'm teaching fear and trembling right now, and Abraham's the hero for being ready to kill Isaac.

101
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:42,160
I mean, Heidegger, I think, is sort of in the Kierkegaard position in the sense that you can be called, if you're really a world-isclosing being, you can be called to do things that look on the basis of the current ethics of the culture as outrageously wrong.

102
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:50,880
And you can't even say what I just said, you should trust it if it tells you at least at first approximation what one does.

103
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:56,239
Because it may be just absolutely wrong what one does, or totally stupid, silly.

104
00:13:56,239 --> 00:14:00,080
I mean, you, I mean, in other courses, know my favorite example of this.

105
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:10,240
If your conscience tells you you should send Christmas cards, and it's telling you you failed to do something you should, and now you owe everybody a Christmas card, that's not just wrong.

106
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:29,119
It's silly, and it, and particularly, I mean, if there are people across the street who send me Christmas cards, then it covers up the idea that whatever it is that you could do to relate to other people in some daily, unique, interesting way.

107
00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:31,119
Okay, I don't know if I've helped any.

108
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:32,000
Did that help any?

109
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,199
I just, I mean, the same sort of a summary digress of what we may have gone through last time.

110
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,239
Okay, I'll go back to this.

111
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:41,840
Where were we?

112
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:46,320
Okay, this is still supposed to be an introduction, so let me get through it fast.

113
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,119
So, oh, yeah, I forgot.

114
00:14:49,119 --> 00:15:05,600
And just again, and why is consciousness calling into all these sort of high-level, deep, religious, rational, and trivial things that you should be doing in heaven or should be doing and are doing and so forth?

115
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,639
Why is it doing all that?

116
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,320
Because of the unsettledness of Dasein.

117
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:15,560
There isn't any way to find out, because Dasein has no normal sort of nature.

118
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:20,359
What is natural, what is what God wants, what reason demands, and so forth.

119
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:22,439
And now I get to back to where I was.

120
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:34,199
It's not only not telling you what's what, it's covering up this way that we are not able, unsettled, ungrounded.

121
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:42,200
There is no way to appeal to any specific principles of any sort to guide you or justify what you do.

122
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:45,480
It's a very existential point.

123
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,039
And it starts with Kierkegaard, I presume, or with Pascal, maybe.

124
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,080
Okay, now let's see.

125
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:56,519
Okay, so we're going to go on today.

126
00:15:56,679 --> 00:16:11,159
That was supposed to prepare you for how hard the death chapter is, because when you start, you start with an ordinary sense of death, just as you started with guilt, with the ordinary understanding of guilt.

127
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:13,240
That's how it happens in formal indication.

128
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,320
You've got to start where you are.

129
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:23,800
But the normal sense of death is certainly something that happens to people at the end of their life.

130
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:26,919
Something that happens to people on their deathbed.

131
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,920
What John Hoagland calls croaking.

132
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:30,600
That's what it's about.

133
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,879
And that's exactly not.

134
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:39,640
I mean, it's got to be not only wrong, but sort of motivatedly wrong.

135
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:41,800
That is, it's got to be a cover-up.

136
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:48,679
Why would it be a cover-up to think that death had something to do with what happened at the end of your life?

137
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,320
Well, because whatever it is, you can then think of that as something in the future.

138
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,519
Didn't I say this last time?

139
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,359
I'm beginning to get found as if I heard myself.

140
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:59,680
You begin to think that this is something in the future.

141
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:10,320
This, well, the word's going to be demise, finally, this demise, this final event.

142
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,199
You think of this thing as something in the future.

143
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,560
It isn't even a normal event because it's gone.

144
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,119
By the time it happens, you're not there anymore.

145
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,159
But you think of it as in the future.

146
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:28,320
And thereby, sort of not right now.

147
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,080
Well, that's rather reassuring.

148
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:37,920
And then thereby, you can take all these homeopathic medicines that will make you live longer and exercise every day, and that'll make you live longer.

149
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,080
And don't do stupid things where you might get hurt and so forth.

150
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:50,639
There are ways to postpone anyway indefinitely, because why shouldn't it always be in the future?

151
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:54,479
You're ceasing to exist.

152
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:30,239
So the very idea that demise is about something that's going to happen to you in the future but isn't happening to you right now is not only wrong, it's covering up your somehow a kind of emptiness, a kind of unsettledness, a kind of nullity, which is structurally part of Dasein, and which Dasein is in all the time, or lives all, or a what?

153
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:46,199
It's its structural, whatever death is, it's going to turn out to be some structural characteristic of Doddheim, and it's not going to turn out to be an event in the future which hasn't happened yet and may not happen for a while.

154
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:55,560
So I told you both that the common sense meaning of death is demise and that it's not just any old mistake that you might think it is.

155
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:01,639
It's that it wants to get, it wants to cover up something and get a kind of control on something.

156
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:13,159
And another Heidegger way of talking, death, authentic oncological death, makes you constantly anxious in a positive sort of way.

157
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:19,159
That turning death into an event in the future makes it something you can fear.

158
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:26,280
And already fearing it, then you can avoid it, try to prevent it, at least delay it, and so forth.

159
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:32,119
And that's much more reassuring than anxiety.

160
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:36,680
Okay, so that's the formal indications thing.

161
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:46,119
We know we're going to have to start with an event that happens to people, terminal event when people live, where they just get annihilated.

162
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:49,399
And we know that that's not going to be what death is.

163
00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:54,199
But whatever death is, that's a denial of it, a cover of it.

164
00:19:54,199 --> 00:19:58,199
Okay, so now we get to what death is.

165
00:19:58,199 --> 00:20:00,439
But we don't get there very directly.

166
00:20:00,439 --> 00:20:03,879
This is a very hard chapter and very confusing.

167
00:20:03,879 --> 00:20:21,399
And it's given rise to those of you who've read the Carol Whitepiece, who at least, I don't know how many I listed by, I didn't count them about getting different, very different, and all wrong, every one of them, the interpretations of what, according to Heidegger, death is.

168
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:23,359
And why is this chapter so hard?

169
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,280
Because Heidegger, again, it's the formal indication story.

170
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,679
And he starts by telling you what everyday understanding of death is.

171
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,359
And then he says he's ontologizing it and formalizing it.

172
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,600
Dead by dead, he gets it more antologized and formalized as he goes through the chapter.

173
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:51,280
And the trouble is, he never can tell quite exactly when he's finally said that death really is and gotten rid of all the cover of it.

174
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:57,919
I mean, I couldn't tell you, maybe one of you can tell me if you do come to office on it, I think I totally know roughly where it is.

175
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:14,160
At what point does he finally get to the formal, ontological, correct, essential description of that structural phenomenon of Dasein, which we misnamed, but nonetheless indicate.

176
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:19,199
You know, it's this, we're pointing at it even though we're using the wrong properties to point at it.

177
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:23,679
What we're trying to get to when we talk about death.

178
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:31,679
And so now we go through, and I just want to tell you sort of there are these stages in the account.

179
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,479
There seem to be at least four stages.

180
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:49,439
Even if you reorder the book and make it into a linear argument of some sort, it's still hard to see, though it's linear in some sense, what the steps are in this story.

181
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:52,320
So first there's the everyday interpretation.

182
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
That's what I was giving you already.

183
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,639
So, you know, one dies.

184
00:21:56,959 --> 00:22:04,960
And that's a franchising fact about events far off in the future and not applying to you, but just one in general.

185
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,080
It isn't that Lord Geyser dies.

186
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:16,759
In fact, he's dying right now in some sense, but it's this general thing that one dies and one dies some other time.

187
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,239
Now we're talking, clearly, he's not going to, that's not what he's talking about.

188
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:42,439
And there seems to be something like an existentialist, in which you live somehow facing up to this terminal event, which is normally called dying or death, and which I either call demise.

189
00:22:42,439 --> 00:22:44,279
I have to do this in funny order.

190
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,759
I'm not really, I mean, we could define demise right now, but it was just complicated thing.

191
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,359
So just think of it as old death.

192
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:58,840
The existentialist thing is, well, what attitude should you have toward death?

193
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,680
And it's clearly not the event at your end of your life that matters.

194
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:07,720
It's how you relate to the event at the end of your life that matters.

195
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:12,359
That's already pretty much a definition of demise.

196
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:21,479
Demise is pariquin, which is just what animals do too, but parry thing the way humans carry.

197
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:31,719
And whatever that, sorry, yeah, the way humans carry, and that means taking a stand on the fact that we are, we organisms carry.

198
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:40,840
And that stand takes that event, the pariquin, and gives it a meaning.

199
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:46,679
And depending on what meaning you give it, you live some one layer of life or another.

200
00:23:46,679 --> 00:24:04,639
But so the most influence move is then, how to how to live in terms of this final fact, the Dasein that faces the possibility, well, on through 94, the possibility of no longer being able to be there.

201
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,119
There are all kinds of possible statements on this.

202
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:33,919
The most interesting one is really Star, because Star criticizes Heidegger on death in being in time because one thing that is that Heidegger must mean that there is this, that death must be the name for this kind of annihilation that's going to happen to you at the end of your life.

203
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:52,560
And then when Heidegger decides in effect that you could live in terms of it, Star says, well, if you live in terms of it, if you thought about how absolutely you, I mean how totally you're going to be wiped out and all not that all you care about will be wiped out, that you're caring about everything will be wiped out and so forth.

204
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,999
There'd be no reason for you to do anything rather than anything else.

205
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,760
You know the story of the wall.

206
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,639
I don't know how many know Star's story of the wall.

207
00:25:00,639 --> 00:25:07,439
When somebody's sentenced to death and they, the next morning they will be killed.

208
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:13,439
And overnight they get clearer and clearer about what it is that there's going to happen to them the next morning.

209
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:17,600
And by the next morning, it's sort of like a Dostoevsky story.

210
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,679
When they're before the firing squad, they suddenly get pardoned.

211
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:30,719
And then that they've given up, they sort of distance themselves from the person they loved and the cause they're serving and the friends that they are protecting and everything.

212
00:25:30,719 --> 00:25:41,399
So that when they finally find out that they're not going to die, the end of the court story is the guy just falls on the ground laughing because there's nothing anymore that it makes sense to do.

213
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:49,719
Well, that makes a sensefulist view of death all right, and it certainly isn't what Heidegger is interested in.

214
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:59,240
It isn't as if he even exactly wants to deny it, it's just that he's not interested in what, or he's not going to tell you about anyway.

215
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:12,760
Maybe he's, I mean, the book, the ontology of it, isn't going to tell you about how you could feel about the fact that at the end of their life you're going to be wiped out and all you're caring about anything is going to be wiped out.

216
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,159
That's not the question.

217
00:26:15,719 --> 00:26:19,080
Now, here's already the first confusing thing.

218
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,879
And if anybody can tell me how to fix it, I would be happy.

219
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:28,359
Remember that there is then a footnote to Ivan Ilya's death, the Tolstoy story.

220
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:39,960
I can't understand why Heidegger's got it in there, because that looks like an existentialist account of somebody on their deathbed and what they're learning when they're on their deathbed.

221
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:42,999
Yeah, you want to find it and we'll look at it?

222
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,639
So maybe if we looked at it, somebody could explain to me what's going on there.

223
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:48,119
Where is it?

224
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:49,479
It's in the footnotes.

225
00:26:49,639 --> 00:26:50,919
Anybody found it?

226
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,399
495.

227
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:55,879
Why did he do that?

228
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,919
We haven't got any troubles already.

229
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:00,600
Where is 495?

230
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,040
In the English?

231
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,679
I don't see it yet.

232
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:09,479
Note 12 on page 495.

233
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,279
Oh, yeah.

234
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,119
I think it's the longest thing.

235
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:21,800
In this story, The Death of Ivan Illy, in his story, The Death, Tolstoy has presented the phenomenon of the disruption and breakdown of having someone die.

236
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,799
That's already wrong.

237
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:24,160
It isn't having someone die.

238
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:35,119
And Spruitt talks about that, but he talks a lot more about what it feels like to be dying and go and exist in Cel.

239
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:38,639
And that gives nothing that Heidegger could be interested in.

240
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:39,279
What he tells you.

241
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,200
How many read The Death of Ivan Ilyich?

242
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:42,480
I mean, not very many.

243
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,520
Well, that's interesting.

244
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:56,959
It's a story about how he feels more and more withdrawn because he sees that his death isn't important to anybody the way it's important to him, not even to his family, not even to his wife.

245
00:27:56,959 --> 00:28:03,359
And he also feels that he's wasted his whole life, and that's all very touching, but it just isn't the point.

246
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:03,760
Yeah.

247
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,119
Ah, that's why it's having someone to just die.

248
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:07,439
Ah.

249
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,399
That's right.

250
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:17,039
It's inconvenient to the family that there he is in his bedroom dying and they're trying to go on with their life's work.

251
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,159
Ah, good.

252
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,200
Well, you six good.

253
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:24,960
I mean, I've always thought he was good, but that's not really what Tolstoy is interested in, I don't think.

254
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:27,119
The very tiny part of it.

255
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:37,279
I don't know if Heidegger's a very good reader of actual texts, but he gets interesting things out of them, even though they may not be very important to the text.

256
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:48,959
Okay, so that's another example of sort of optical quoting and what Effective has on the people who are doing it and the people around them.

257
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:58,080
And I just remember something so crazy that I'll tell you, because it's just an anecdote that it's amazing.

258
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,679
And not very complimentary to Heidegger, I must say, but it's good.

259
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:11,960
When Heidegger had been barred from teaching, he was desperate to get in touch with the rest of the world.

260
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:14,359
He was so desperate that he talked to me for an afternoon.

261
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:22,759
And that's pretty desperate if you're Heidegger, but I had written him and said I was going to teach him at MIT, and he was so happy.

262
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,480
But he also wanted to talk to Star.

263
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:32,759
So there's a letter from him to Sartre, who says to Star, I understand your criticism.

264
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,520
And Sartre's criticism of Heidegger's view of death is, of course, all wrong.

265
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,840
It's the criticism from what I told you already in the wall.

266
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,840
But if you actually thought about your death, you'd be paralyzed and not be able to do anything.

267
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:49,239
The desperated act, Sartre says, in effect, is to cover it up.

268
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,240
You have to cover it up if you're going to go on.

269
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,239
Living, Heidegger writes a letter to Sartre.

270
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,600
He says, I see what you're saying.

271
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,119
Yes, I accept your criticism of my view about death.

272
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:04,759
I see that we're on the same time, but why don't you come by and talk?

273
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:12,119
In effect, and today I was rather reading Zapransky, really, he set up a meeting with Sartre.

274
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:15,720
And Sartre had the good sense not to come.

275
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:18,919
I don't know whether we just screwed him up or said, I'm sorry.

276
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:31,479
But when I talked to Heidegger, who, as I say, was desperate, he had on his desk Sartre being a nothingness because now reading this biography, I see that he was preparing, hopefully, for this visit of Sartre.

277
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,239
But when I said, I see you're reading Sartre, what do you think about it?

278
00:30:35,239 --> 00:30:38,760
And he said, these voice must be in effect on Fine.

279
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,919
How can I begin to research Lubbock?

280
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,480
Or maybe it's a crap, I don't know.

281
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,719
I mean, it'd be more like that, right?

282
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:46,280
Yes.

283
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,159
I mean, that's the way.

284
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,399
He never believed a word of it.

285
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:53,279
Anyway, he's just a total hypocrite.

286
00:30:52,439 --> 00:30:55,999
I don't think we can do anything about it.

287
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,479
Let's separate the man from the moral of that.

288
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,240
Okay, back to where we were.

289
00:31:02,879 --> 00:31:25,280
The next one, after the everyday reading and the existentialist reading, then we get to Heidegger, who says he's doing a formal ontological existential, not existential, that which is existential with, but in full existential impression of death is what he wants.

290
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:42,080
Now it's time it's, by the way, I see that I wrote something that fits with what Eugene has said on 308 is where he's saying what it is that Tolstoy gets my book untangled here.

291
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,600
308.

292
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,520
Suddenly, my book seems to be going backwards.

293
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,440
Let's try it this way.

294
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:48,880
Okay, good.

295
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,239
308.

296
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,879
What do I say about it there?

297
00:31:54,639 --> 00:31:56,719
This is what he thinks I've been illusion is about.

298
00:31:56,719 --> 00:31:58,079
I now understand it.

299
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,600
So I want to look it up.

300
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,760
Yes, about ten lines down.

301
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:18,159
When we're facing our death, it makes manifest that all being alongside the things in which we concern ourselves and all being with others will fail us when our own ability to be is the issue.

302
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:23,760
Now, it's interesting that, and he says Tolstoy sees that.

303
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,919
I don't know what he does.

304
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:52,840
What's strange is that Heidegger, who's now in the middle of his existential projection of authentic gain towards death, which starts on 304, is ready to bring that in as part of the true structure of death, namely at the top of the page that it's non-relational.

305
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,119
This is supposed to say that it's non-relational.

306
00:32:57,239 --> 00:32:58,520
And let's put it in a little bit.

307
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,520
His concern and politics fail us.

308
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:06,839
This does not signify at all that these ways the Gaussian have been cut off from its authentically being itself.

309
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:12,200
As structures essential to Gaussian, they are still there and so forth.

310
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:18,040
What I'm going to say is, I don't know what level of analysis this is.

311
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:28,680
Is this, it seems, it sounds sort of existential, that the existential with other relations, the relations of others, will fail us.

312
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:32,439
I don't know what it is, because is it really structural?

313
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,719
Is it true that all relations with others will have to fail us when we're on our deathbed?

314
00:33:37,719 --> 00:33:46,279
We can't, love can't transcend that, or commitment to some incredible cause, but going to do something about it.

315
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:47,799
Again, I just don't know.

316
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:55,560
He's going through a whole lot of characteristics of death here, and he says he's doing an existential discussion of them.

317
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:13,480
So I guess we're supposed to think that it's a necessary structural feature of having the right relations to demise, which is that you will become isolated.

318
00:34:13,759 --> 00:34:20,280
Yes, Heidegger into all sorts of trouble because now I don't know whether I can find this, because I wasn't going to say it.

319
00:34:20,279 --> 00:34:21,239
Help me find it.

320
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:25,919
There's a place where he talks about Dasein's existential solar system.

321
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,480
Anybody remember that?

322
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,880
Habermas gets onto that and gets very concerned about that.

323
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,360
And this is all tied in with the non-relational thing.

324
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,040
Maybe it's under anxiety and not under death.

325
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,159
It could be in either place.

326
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,879
I doubt if we could find it.

327
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,119
Oh boy, 233.

328
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,520
Oh, it is back in anxiety.

329
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:59,839
But it's tied up with this thing that Heidegger couldn't be saying, I think, that there is, or if he is, well, maybe it's all right for him to say it.

330
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:00,399
I don't know.

331
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:12,159
But it's not all right for Habermas to think that Heidegger is thereby saying that Dasein is, in some sense, totally independent and self-really independent and self-sufficient.

332
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:27,119
On 233 in italics, he's talking about anxiety, and it individualizes, it makes claim that with the phenomenon of anxiety, a distinctive disposiveness, there's a theme of interpretation.

333
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:33,280
Anxiety individuals individuates Dasein and discloses it as solus ipsis.

334
00:35:33,279 --> 00:35:36,239
That means isolated by itself.

335
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:40,639
Well, I don't know what's the exact translation of anybody in the Latin.

336
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,999
Alone itself, alone itself.

337
00:35:44,319 --> 00:35:59,680
And this existential sola system, and now Habermas, and it's always hot too, to stop with that and say, aha, Heidegger thinks that human beings are ultimately self-sufficient and isolated.

338
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:01,279
That's just so wrong.

339
00:36:01,279 --> 00:36:12,439
I mean, that's just so Cartesian, where every individual self-contained mind is off in its warm room doing geometry or writing philosophy or whatever.

340
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:18,679
Of course, Heidegger thinks that it's part of Dasein's structure to be being in the world.

341
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:20,440
And it's the next sentence.

342
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,040
Anxiety individuals takes Dasein and disposes it as solids.

343
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:32,999
But this existential soloism is so far from the displacement of putting an isolated subject into an emptiness of a world occurring.

344
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:40,760
In an extreme sense, what it does is precisely to bring Dasein face to face with his world as world, with itself as being in the world.

345
00:36:40,759 --> 00:36:44,119
And of course, that includes being with others.

346
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:48,999
So I don't know back to where we were now what is going on.

347
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,520
Most of the stuff I just don't know what's going on, right?

348
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:58,119
But lots of the time, how isolated is Dasein when it's dying?

349
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,880
And what difference does it make?

350
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:12,119
Because it isn't as if it's going to be going to reveal the fact that we were and we always will be alone, some dramatic thing like that.

351
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:15,639
Where were we on 308, right?

352
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,119
So there's a problem.

353
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:24,439
Ask yourself, sort of, why is Heidegger so clear that death is non-relational?

354
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,359
And what does he expect to get out of it?

355
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,440
And what is it supposed to reveal about Dasein?

356
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,080
Yeah, Eugene.

357
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:33,159
One thing, the first thing is that it must be taken over by Dasein alone.

358
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:36,359
That's the part about how no one can do it for you, and you can't do it together.

359
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,879
Ah, that's fine.

360
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,359
Good.

361
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:40,280
That's true.

362
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,439
Yes, you have to do it alone.

363
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,360
Nobody can do it for you.

364
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,879
But if that's all that non-relational means, that's interesting.

365
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,839
Let's see.

366
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:51,320
Let's look and see if there's any clue there.

367
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:56,399
I read it to refer back to the anxiety condition of being alone.

368
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:01,600
Dasein lays claim to death as Daseine as an individual Dasein.

369
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,639
That's fine.

370
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,800
As I'm just doing this, it individualizes Dasein down to itself.

371
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:19,040
It makes manifest that all being alongside things, if we concern ourselves and all being with others, will fail us when our own most potentiality for being anything is with us.

372
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,879
Isn't that wrong?

373
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,280
I mean, why would he say that?

374
00:38:23,279 --> 00:38:25,520
I mean, you're right, that's what he thinks.

375
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:49,199
That death individuates us, but that's what leads people like Habermas to think, that he thinks that when those people in the ships are down, then all our relation to everything but ourselves is just canceled or not important or seeming to be not important because that's going to be what it says.

376
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:50,079
What does it take?

377
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,200
Try again.

378
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:56,880
Well, I thought I was going to read the first thing, but I think I was a bit knowledgeing that for you.

379
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,639
It is you.

380
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:00,000
And after death, you have...

381
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:02,880
Certainly, after death, you have no relation to anything.

382
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,520
I don't think that's one of the things he's talking about.

383
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:08,719
Really?

384
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,079
Huh.

385
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:11,600
That sounds wrong to me.

386
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,280
Let's try the first thing.

387
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,159
Okay.

388
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:17,200
I think you do have to do it alone.

389
00:39:17,759 --> 00:39:21,999
But I'm not sure that he really has a right to say it's individuating.

390
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:37,639
But what he doesn't seem to have a right to say is that just because you have to do it alone, that you are isolated from that you can't, that all concern for others and for other things fails you.

391
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:42,199
I see that it fails you if you expect any help.

392
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:45,639
That you should somebody should hold your hand.

393
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:49,800
But that it fails you in any stronger sense and it doesn't.

394
00:39:49,799 --> 00:39:52,919
Well, but then it's what's wrong to call that non-relatable, isn't it?

395
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,280
Let me try it again.

396
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:59,560
Being alongside things is fail us or not all of us.

397
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,799
It can be authentic only if it makes this possible for us of its own accord.

398
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:11,159
But if concerns us fail us, this does not signify at all because those who die that have been cut off from their sociological stuff.

399
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:12,280
Uh-huh.

400
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:18,760
So they fail us only in the sense that we have to die our death ourselves.

401
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,759
That's the right way to read it, I guess.

402
00:40:20,759 --> 00:40:22,920
That's what you wanted to say.

403
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,560
It brings you into your unique situation.

404
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:27,959
It brings you into your unique situation.

405
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,520
In that sense, it individualizes us.

406
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:37,240
Well, except that why do the other things we concern ourselves fail us?

407
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:40,280
Why aren't they part of our unique situation?

408
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,399
They can't get you out of it.

409
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:42,839
Well, they can't get you out of it.

410
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:43,799
That's core.

411
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:58,999
I think there's also a just of a estrangement on the unheimless or on use of the homelessness, where he's, I mean, on 233, if we test reading, he goes down to this last part of the second paragraph.

412
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,999
He says, As Dazine falls, anxiety brings a fast from its absorption in the world.

413
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:07,239
Everyday familiarity collapses.

414
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:12,680
God's line has been individualized, but individualized as being in the world.

415
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:18,040
Being in intros into the existential mode of the not at home.

416
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,199
Nothing else is meant by our talk.

417
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,600
Where are you all on being and?

418
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:25,600
233, just right after 189 in the system.

419
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:39,040
I mean, that whole paragraph is so, you know, we're not individualized in the sense that we're completely pulled out of the world or something that was, you know, counter strings.

420
00:41:39,759 --> 00:41:42,960
Our world is a world, if we're also.

421
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:48,159
And so everyday familiarity collapses, which is totally the episode on every day.

422
00:41:48,159 --> 00:42:00,800
I mean, the kind of familiarity that you get from as the one and just sort of how you how things normally matter and what don't how we normally deal with them and all that collapses.

423
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,040
So much that we don't recognize that we are thinking about.

424
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,719
Yeah, we're still in a room.

425
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,719
We're still in a familiar room and all that.

426
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:18,800
In some ways, in this case, the estrangement that Heiger is trying to bring out the phenomena of us, that world even becomes more present to us, even though we become estranged from it.

427
00:42:18,799 --> 00:42:21,759
I mean, it seems like he wants to make both of them.

428
00:42:21,759 --> 00:42:22,080
We're not.

429
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,639
Okay, yeah, so it's a world that we have to get back in touch with somehow or that we're in.

430
00:42:26,799 --> 00:42:28,720
We're not completely solid cystic.

431
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:37,680
I mean, part of it seems like part of the anxiety is that we recognize that we are worlded creatures and we have an estrangement from that world.

432
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:44,799
That we have to get that we better get and that's not our that's not our true state.

433
00:42:44,799 --> 00:42:54,159
I mean, it sounds like it sometimes sounds like, and I think that's the view I'm trying to both explain and believe it.

434
00:42:54,159 --> 00:43:04,000
If you get more and more authentic when when you get estranged and and set off from others than when from the familiar, and that's the wrong way to think about it.

435
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,520
You know, it's okay.

436
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:22,280
So 'cause they ought to say, well, that being in the world is essential to Dasein and it stays that way even when it's dying, even when it's uh, you know, having it uh in touch getting in touch with anxiety, you'd better still be in the world with people and so forth.

437
00:43:22,279 --> 00:43:24,839
Uh you look really worried.

438
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:25,879
Good.

439
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:33,239
No one can take away your death from you, but also no one can uh get you out of the breakdown situation.

440
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:38,839
Like if you if you have a breakdown with a hammer, someone can give you a better hammer and and then someone else gets your breakdown.

441
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:43,400
But if you have if you have anxiety, no one can help you out of it.

442
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,239
Oh, well that's that's good.

443
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:47,159
I mean let's read it the ingenious way.

444
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:53,159
I mean, so this is it says anxiety and death are isolating in the swim south.

445
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:59,000
Nobody can help you get out of them or or feel at home in them.

446
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,760
You've got to get out of them by feeling at home in them, really, but on your own.

447
00:44:04,759 --> 00:44:05,560
Yeah.

448
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,119
Okay.

449
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:11,159
Well, I think arguably helps you in excitement, but there's something that you have to do yourself to deal with.

450
00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:13,000
Where does he talk about this?

451
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:14,359
In that one.

452
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,679
I read that one lately, but I don't remember that.

453
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:23,080
We may be on something about the relation of this fruit to depression.

454
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:23,480
What that?

455
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:25,480
Yeah, but treat them as the same phenomenon.

456
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:27,719
Yeah, some things depression and anxiety are the same.

457
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:34,680
I I would get all upset and annoyed about that if it weren't that later Heidegger wants to say the same thing.

458
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:44,440
Uh well, but only after he's had therapy and like gotten over his if input anxiety and the occurrence of Finlay's type the most prevalent exposedness.

459
00:44:44,440 --> 00:45:02,079
I mean they're not we think that depression is our most prevalent uh if uh removed and that would be in a way that's what so he so so those wouldn't be God wouldn't be being in time anyway, I think, treating a lot of depression.

460
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,240
Tyler, do you have your hand up?

461
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,319
Say loud person.

462
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:11,199
He said that, right?

463
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:18,000
And I think so they don't fail you in your particular things of bringing you morphine or something.

464
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:19,520
You don't think that's the right thing.

465
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,440
Well you guys will have to discuss each other with it.

466
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,960
What do you think that's the stronger part that you have, all being alongside collapses or fails you?

467
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,200
What's failing you?

468
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:35,040
And I see that's all you that's the only thing that would matter at this point is that they could die for you and they can't.

469
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,040
And in that sense they fail you.

470
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,759
Okay, well that that sounds that sounds good.

471
00:45:39,759 --> 00:45:41,919
I mean you're really just taking which is good.

472
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,679
You don't really disagree with Eugene.

473
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:57,680
The main because you're both saying the the way it works is that death is such that nobody can save you from it or or they die for you.

474
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:05,600
And that's that means that at on that point, at that level, they are irrelevant.

475
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,119
Everybody and everything is failing you and irrelevant for you.

476
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:12,480
That's what you both think.

477
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:12,960
Yeah?

478
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:20,879
Well, he could have meant that, but in the text it's clear that he doesn't.

479
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,040
It's he it's it means stand in for you.

480
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,479
I can't quote the sentence, but that's what it's certainly about, yeah.

481
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,879
294, stronger things.

482
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,400
Okay, let's work.

483
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:40,360
So like two thirds of the way down, where he introduced this non-relation, all right, before that, he says, um, when Dasein stands before itself in his way, all relations and the other Dawson has been undone.

484
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,560
Hmm.

485
00:46:37,279 --> 00:46:44,359
Yeah, that's the stronger one, all right.

486
00:46:44,920 --> 00:47:01,080
And that's really the one that gets him into trouble because if Dasein is being with, then you couldn't be in a state of where it looks like in authentic dying as well as inauthentic dying, all relation sellers are undone.

487
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:04,359
And that means then you begin to think like Habermas and Tugenot.

488
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,399
Well, look at that.

489
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,280
Authentic Dasein doesn't need anybody.

490
00:47:08,279 --> 00:47:09,719
Yeah, so that's unfortunate.

491
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:11,480
I didn't mark where you saw it.

492
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,440
Where is it?

493
00:47:12,759 --> 00:47:13,799
Okay, ice cream.

494
00:47:13,799 --> 00:47:17,560
Yes, there's the possibility of the absolute impossibility of Dazan.

495
00:47:21,799 --> 00:47:26,520
If that doesn't think you'll be in pain, I don't see it yet.

496
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,480
What?

497
00:47:27,799 --> 00:47:28,520
Oh, I see.

498
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,119
Ah, that was.

499
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,399
Ah, I see it now.

500
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:31,960
Guess what?

501
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,959
I have a question mark in the margin there.

502
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:35,560
Now I see why.

503
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,520
Okay, yes, but I don't think he could say that.

504
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:44,839
Get carried away into his more existentialist side.

505
00:47:44,839 --> 00:47:46,759
Maybe that's where you could take the card.

506
00:47:46,759 --> 00:47:50,760
Yeah, we're on the same wavelength, but you couldn't.

507
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,520
Let's see.

508
00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:53,879
Okay, where are we?

509
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,360
Authentic existential.

510
00:47:56,679 --> 00:48:03,560
So now I say go to 305, but I don't know why, where we are yet, so I get to 305.

511
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:07,799
Well, that's just, I mark that as the sort of antique art.

512
00:48:07,799 --> 00:48:15,480
I mean, Sartre thinks that Heidegger thinks that dwelling upon the end is what you should be doing.

513
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,759
And Sartre's right.

514
00:48:17,239 --> 00:48:24,319
Dwelling on that end, that final moment is certainly how you're going to be wiped out by it.

515
00:48:22,279 --> 00:48:26,880
Certainly not what you should be doing.

516
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,159
Neither dwelling on it as something awful or dwelling on it as something terrific.

517
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:46,799
I mean, I've been listening lately to Bach, many, many places where Bach is just thinking about his death while you're talking to Lynchunda, the fact, ring the final bell.

518
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:48,720
That's really going to be terrific.

519
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:51,520
And I think Heidegger would say that must be inauthentic.

520
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,560
I mean, Bach is thinking, oh, it's going to be even better in the next world.

521
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:58,240
And the sooner we get out of this one, it sounds like he's saying, the better.

522
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:07,920
Yeah, yeah, it's a common theme in German music and I guess a lot of poetry at the time.

523
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,839
Well, that's equally bad.

524
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:13,839
I mean, looking forward to your death is just as bad as regretting it.

525
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:19,200
I mean, it's not a kind of event that you suppose to have an attitude about.

526
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:29,280
At least, I mean, you can, it is an event of a sort, and you will have an attitude about it of a sort, but Heidegger's just not interested in what attitude you have about it.

527
00:49:29,279 --> 00:49:31,520
You're not supposed to be dwelling on it.

528
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,079
You're supposed to be an important event dwelling in it.

529
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:43,600
It's supposed to color everything, whatever this death characteristic is, it's going to cover your relation to everything.

530
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,879
That's the next thing I want to say here, I guess.

531
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,560
I get there quickly.

532
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,359
Well, I'll drum ahead.

533
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:56,319
Death, this is something Hoeman takes out and makes a lot of fuss about, but it's important to say it here.

534
00:49:56,719 --> 00:49:59,999
Dying is a way of life for Heidegger.

535
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:03,840
It's not something that happens to you at the end of your life.

536
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:10,760
It's a general characteristic of Dasein, and authentically you face up to it.

537
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,280
This is the bottom of 289.

538
00:50:14,279 --> 00:50:18,440
It's always had to think you know where one is, how formalized one is.

539
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:19,959
You never know.

540
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:27,800
This is supposed to be prior to 293, which is the preliminary sketch of an existential ontological structure of death.

541
00:50:27,799 --> 00:50:34,039
Yes, you could be saying something existential ontological here at the bottom of 289.

542
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:36,679
Just with Dasein is already its not yet.

543
00:50:36,679 --> 00:50:38,040
I'm just reading that paragraph.

544
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:43,560
And is it's not yet constantly, as long as it lives, it is already its end too.

545
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:48,359
The ending which we have in view when we speak of death does not signify Dasein's being in an end.

546
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:57,560
That would be perishing or taking a stand on perishing by having to be demised.

547
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,600
Rather, it's a being towards the end.

548
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:05,320
Death is a way to be, which Dasein takes over as soon as it is.

549
00:51:06,759 --> 00:51:09,479
And that's, I mean, you've got to get used to that.

550
00:51:09,719 --> 00:51:11,639
That's the, where am I?

551
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:15,960
About five lines from the bottom of 289.

552
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,960
Death is a way to be, which Dasein takes over as soon as it is.

553
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:32,600
Well, that means death is a way of behaving or a core comportment that colors everything you do and everything you see and how anything shows up for you.

554
00:51:33,639 --> 00:51:37,000
There's nothing special about that final event.

555
00:51:37,799 --> 00:51:44,039
That that final event is just a why.

556
00:51:44,759 --> 00:51:49,159
It's a kind of oh boy.

557
00:51:49,159 --> 00:51:51,080
I never can understand this.

558
00:51:51,520 --> 00:52:03,600
How can you be non-relational the non-relational state, for instance, is supposed to be a general characteristic of Dasein's dying all the time.

559
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,639
But it can't be that Dasein is non-relational all the time.

560
00:52:06,799 --> 00:52:08,960
Anytime I try to think about it, I have it tied in notch.

561
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:15,119
You get any help and you think, how can non-relational be a way of life?

562
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:17,359
Or is it because now you can always bitter?

563
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:28,479
I'm demonstrating why this chapter is so confusing, because now you could say, well, that's not really the that's that's not even the preliminary sketch of an existential ontological structure of death.

564
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,000
That's on 293.

565
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,600
Who knows what that is?

566
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:40,080
That's on 290, how the existential analysis of death is distinguished from other possible interpretations of this phenomenon.

567
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:45,200
Now, maybe that makes it all right.

568
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:58,879
Because it sometimes seems to me, or often seems to me, that what Heidegger is doing is gradually ontologizing and gradually taking back our understanding of death.

569
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:05,360
And see, and so 299, he hasn't got to the full existential conception of death.

570
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:10,959
And even that may not be the final story.

571
00:53:11,279 --> 00:53:17,119
As I say, I don't know exactly, and I'm ready for anybody to come and tell me where exactly the final story is.

572
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:24,080
By the time you get to the top of 311, you've got it all in there in italic.

573
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,239
You keep keep that little beat in mind whenever you get lost.

574
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:44,359
Anticipation, that's I'm jumping ahead because anticipation and he's jumping ahead because he on 311 he shouldn't he really isn't any ready to talk about anticipatory resoluteness because he hasn't done guilt yet or am I lost?

575
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:48,040
I get lost in his craziness.

576
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:49,480
No, that's right.

577
00:53:49,799 --> 00:53:51,080
So but let's do it anyway.

578
00:53:51,080 --> 00:54:01,400
Anticipation reveals to Dasein its lostness in the oneself and brings it face to face with the possibility of being itself, primarily unsupported by concern for solicitude.

579
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:17,159
That fits the idea with nobody sort of being able to take your place, but of being itself rather in an impassioned freedom towards death, a freedom which has been released from the illusions of the day and which is practical, certain of itself.

580
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:35,399
And I that's that's okay as long as you don't build into the idea that all relations to others and fall away.

581
00:54:35,719 --> 00:54:37,560
So where was I?

582
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:41,639
I was reading something 311, the other before that.

583
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:52,920
I was saying, how I don't understand, I was saying how Heidegger can say that we are always in this being towards death.

584
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:54,119
Where was I reading it?

585
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:57,800
And yet, say that being towards death is non-relational.

586
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:03,240
Somebody who must have been writing things down, where was I before 311?

587
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:04,919
Yeah.

588
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:19,479
Well, I don't know what to say, except that other human beings play no potential role in Dasein's way of being in the world.

589
00:55:20,199 --> 00:55:28,080
At the time, when, when he will, if Dasein is on its deathbed, no, presumably all the time.

590
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:33,600
But that can't be right because he helps, again, it's because I can't tell anymore which is which.

591
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:39,919
You're having a relational possibility, like if that's what he's on, and you have to be sort of that.

592
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:41,119
Okay, sure.

593
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:48,960
So what's non-relational is that no one can take your place, and that's going to stay there no matter.

594
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,159
That's a possibility.

595
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:51,359
Is that the possibility?

596
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,239
Non-relation.

597
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:52,959
Okay.

598
00:55:53,600 --> 00:56:03,040
And that and that you will always be related to in the way you live.

599
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:07,360
And yeah, okay.

600
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:27,680
And so what's non-relational is not the way you live, but right now that you, that insofar as you are living a relation to demise, you are alone.

601
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:28,719
And is that right?

602
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:30,480
And that's what's going to be.

603
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,560
What's that relational is that possibility?

604
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:43,600
The possibility of you having no more possibilities is a unique individual possibility.

605
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,480
Okay.

606
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,999
Yeah, that's the best way to hear it.

607
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:47,119
That helped you.

608
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:47,600
Yeah.

609
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,159
Okay.

610
00:56:48,159 --> 00:56:50,239
Now I don't remember where I was, but it doesn't matter.

611
00:56:51,040 --> 00:57:03,519
I want to be on page 291 because I've been talking and talking about demise, and I didn't know where, when to bring it in, but since it's in front of me, we'll put it in at this point.

612
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:11,240
We want to distinguish perishing, which is this event that happens at the end of any living thing.

613
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:16,600
I don't know whether it happens to germs, but it happens to mammals anyway.

614
00:57:17,799 --> 00:57:21,000
And perishing is not what he's talking about.

615
00:57:21,159 --> 00:57:24,920
And this is what he's saying on 291 about 15 lines down.

616
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:28,039
The ending of that which lives, we call perishing.

617
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:33,800
Daseine has its death of the kind appropriate to anything that lives, that's the perishing.

618
00:57:33,799 --> 00:57:38,760
Insofar as this is the case, Daseine too can end without authentically dying.

619
00:57:38,759 --> 00:57:56,760
That is, whatever dying is, which is a way of facing up to the structure of Daseine, you can just live a life in which you never actually face up to the structure of Daseine, and then you end without dying.

620
00:57:56,759 --> 00:58:01,559
Though, on the other hand, quadsine, it does not simply perish.

621
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:06,039
We designate this intermediate phenomenon as demise.

622
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:18,600
Now, that means that demise is the stand you take on the fact that you'll perish, I think.

623
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:30,280
That's an intermediate phenomenon in that it's not the perishing, but how perishing is an issue for you.

624
00:58:30,279 --> 00:58:35,959
And all Dasein are into that intermediate state.

625
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:42,440
Even the ones who don't face up, I think, to the end without authentically dying.

626
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,639
That's right.

627
00:58:44,279 --> 00:59:06,639
But even they don't just perish, I think, because any, just even having the attitude toward your possible perishing that you have if you're in Datman, that it won't happen for a while and maybe could never happen to you, and it's all in the future, even that's a form of relating to your perishing already.

628
00:59:06,639 --> 00:59:16,399
So, demise, I think, is the way that beings like us who have to take a stand on their being and also the impossibility of their being take a stand on it.

629
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,080
You look worried, is that right?

630
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:19,679
Into demise.

631
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:20,239
Really?

632
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:21,519
Where, where, where?

633
00:59:23,279 --> 00:59:23,919
Right there.

634
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:28,000
Well, but I wonder if that's really what LaCorn.

635
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:31,279
Dasein never perish with you.

636
00:59:31,279 --> 00:59:35,600
Daseine, however, can demise only as long as it's dying.

637
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,399
But now medicine doesn't change into quote demising.

638
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:45,119
I think that's supposed to be not what he means by demising.

639
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:48,000
That means really perishing, I guess.

640
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,799
Let me see if you can obtain results, which may even become significant.

641
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:55,839
What do you think?

642
00:59:55,839 --> 01:00:04,400
What would it be for medicine to have a view about the stand that you take on the possibility of having no more possibilities?

643
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,920
I have no idea.

644
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,840
But I see the sentence.

645
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:08,080
Yeah.

646
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:32,960
Would detone in a similar way on the context of how we lead our demise, how long that takes, and we only worship houses because medicine and understanding better how we lead our demise might understand better how we are under maybe.

647
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:39,879
You just don't know what medicine could under medicine could understand about how to meet our demise.

648
01:00:40,199 --> 01:00:45,560
It could try to keep you from being aware of it and so forth, but I don't think he's talking about that.

649
01:00:46,119 --> 01:00:49,800
I think the quotes around demising are pretty important.

650
01:00:49,799 --> 01:00:54,679
I think he thinks that what they really are investigating is perishing.

651
01:00:55,400 --> 01:01:06,440
But maybe not, because he goes on and says, sort of, maybe death in the thickness can be understood from a medical point of view as an existential phenomenon.

652
01:01:08,119 --> 01:01:10,199
Well, I don't know what it means.

653
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,799
So, yeah, the Tyler, you know what it means?

654
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,879
Monarch is an intermediary thing.

655
01:01:23,239 --> 01:01:35,959
I think demise is what happens at the end of a person's life, understood not as perishing, but as something that they've interpreted.

656
01:01:36,759 --> 01:01:49,560
And that's demise is carrying plus having a stand on perishing in the way you normally, in the way you live.

657
01:01:51,719 --> 01:01:55,159
Yeah, it's an attitude toward an event of perishing.

658
01:01:55,159 --> 01:01:56,840
That's let me think now.

659
01:01:56,839 --> 01:02:03,639
And yes, demise, well, that's not quite right.

660
01:02:04,839 --> 01:02:11,959
It's the event of perishing having a demise to it.

661
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,759
I mean, having a uh interpretation to it.

662
01:02:14,759 --> 01:02:24,239
I mean, there is only there's this event, this thing that happens to you finally when you have no more possibilities how you relate to that thing.

663
01:02:20,679 --> 01:02:25,520
But it really is that thing.

664
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:32,080
It's just it is something that everything happens and demise also happens at the end of your life.

665
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,519
That's what I think.

666
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,119
Do you think that's wrong?

667
01:02:35,759 --> 01:02:47,679
I think I think demising is is something that really is in the future, but it's the future thing understood and taken over, you know, as whatever your exit way of doing it is.

668
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:50,880
Ah, Curtis was going to tell you, yeah, go ahead.

669
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,480
Wait, what?

670
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:54,399
Well, wait, wait a second then.

671
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,159
Let's look where on the next paragraph.

672
01:02:56,159 --> 01:02:57,440
Let's look.

673
01:02:57,759 --> 01:03:00,000
Where are you in the next paragraph?

674
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:26,880
Well, um, I thought the sustainable interpretation of the couple lines down in any typology of drawing or characterization of conventions under which the demise of interity in the way through a sort of experience, because I was already referring to a psychology of drawing is information about the living of a person who enjoyed rather than about the dying itself.

675
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:41,759
And simply reflect the fact that we've got one dies and even when it dies off entirely, it does not have to do so with an experience of a practical demise or well, I take that to be sort of on my side, right?

676
01:03:41,759 --> 01:03:49,760
I mean, the important thing is the factical demising is perishing under some interpretation.

677
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:53,360
But what's important isn't perishing under some interpretation.

678
01:03:53,360 --> 01:04:05,519
It's the kind of life that has got the structure it's got because it's got a certain interpretation of perishing.

679
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,959
So that seems inscrutable.

680
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:09,559
Okay, Curtis, your turn is.

681
01:04:11,159 --> 01:04:13,239
The Dasein demise.

682
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:15,080
What's it in the truth of what?

683
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:17,000
It follows demise.

684
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,679
And demos the other way around.

685
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Organic stuff, yes, bodies perish.

686
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,879
And what do you have to add to perishing to get demising?

687
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:29,799
Something only the Daseine can do.

688
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:30,279
What?

689
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:31,639
Can do.

690
01:04:33,159 --> 01:04:34,600
I think, yeah, I think.

691
01:04:34,839 --> 01:04:40,839
It's just a matter of how demise would be.

692
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,639
Paris would be only biological life.

693
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:44,520
That's all right.

694
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:53,000
But what makes the end of Daseine different than the end of biological life is that it's been taken up into a Dasein life and given an interpretation.

695
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,760
Okay, we agree about that.

696
01:04:54,759 --> 01:04:55,639
Yes.

697
01:04:55,960 --> 01:05:04,119
I think, I mean, well, I think that just can't be right because I think Heidegger thinks that demise is something that the Dasein does.

698
01:05:04,119 --> 01:05:07,960
I mean, it is an intermediate phenomenon.

699
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,319
Yes, dying is...

700
01:05:09,319 --> 01:05:10,600
Dying is, that's right.

701
01:05:10,679 --> 01:05:12,440
See, you're just adding one thing.

702
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:16,200
There is perishing, which is what organisms do and who do too.

703
01:05:16,199 --> 01:05:24,280
There is demise, which is a stand-on, what it is to be a perishing kind of creature, which we exhibit in our behavior.

704
01:05:24,279 --> 01:05:32,279
And then there's authentically dying, which is, so to speak, the right stand, which is not to cover it up, for instance.

705
01:05:32,279 --> 01:05:44,360
Whereas the way Dasman, the one, deals with perishing, is already dealing with demise, which says demise happens to other people in the future, or parr perhaps it happens to other people in the future.

706
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:46,039
And that's a way of dealing with parishing.

707
01:05:46,039 --> 01:05:50,199
That is a kind of demise because you've already taken a stand on it in what you do.

708
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:50,959
That's what I think.

709
01:05:50,839 --> 01:05:51,119
Yeah.

710
01:05:51,799 --> 01:05:56,240
Passing away is a way to describe this intermediate phenomenon.

711
01:05:57,039 --> 01:05:59,039
And it's an event at the end of your life.

712
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:59,360
Yes.

713
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:06,879
And but we have to add in there something like, what is it that people can do at the end of their life called passing away?

714
01:06:06,879 --> 01:06:15,119
It's got to be something for which there's been their which has already affected how they live, something like that.

715
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:19,279
Otherwise, I don't see the difference between passing away and parroting.

716
01:06:19,919 --> 01:06:20,959
There isn't much difference.

717
01:06:20,959 --> 01:06:24,799
Oh, they're making a big deal about the difference, though, isn't he?

718
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:29,119
Well, dying is a way in which being is towards its death.

719
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:37,279
According to the Daseine never perishes, however, it can demise only as long as it's dying.

720
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:47,839
And dying is what, it's the way of being in which the Daseine is towards its death.

721
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,759
That's what I'm trying to get.

722
01:06:49,759 --> 01:06:55,919
I mean, the way of being, it is, well, everybody's got something to say about this, but the Stephen, you haven't said anything.

723
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,159
Daseine interpreted it.

724
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,079
It essentially decreases.

725
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:09,679
I mean, you're making it seem as if somehow demising, I mean, maybe this is right, but I'm on the wrong track then.

726
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:17,679
I thought demise was an okay term, but demise describes even the end of authentic Dasein, doesn't it?

727
01:07:17,679 --> 01:07:20,400
I mean, all the Dasein demises.

728
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,480
All Dasein perish too, but whatever, but those are two different things.

729
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:29,440
A Daseine perishes or organisms that come to the end.

730
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:41,719
And a dodge demises has an already interpreted version, uh, or version of what it is for a Daseine to come to the end.

731
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:42,999
And I still hold on to that.

732
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,199
I think I don't worry.

733
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:52,520
I want to go back to this just because I don't think we're going to get any further, and I've got a lot further to get.

734
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:56,200
So if I mean with me, I may not say anything in the term.

735
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:01,799
Doddine has been authentic to die.

736
01:08:01,879 --> 01:08:04,119
I think that wait, wait, does that come in?

737
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:07,239
No, well, that's the other view, the one I'm denying.

738
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:12,999
So we have to find some that I want to say, all dodge, even authentic dodge, demises.

739
01:08:12,999 --> 01:08:14,279
This is the question.

740
01:08:14,759 --> 01:08:21,560
You're saying, no, no, the inauthentic Daseine demises, but authentic Daseine dies when it doesn't demise.

741
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:25,719
Authentic Daseine demises and dies, and we haven't really gotten to it.

742
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,039
Now you're looking unhappy, Curtis.

743
01:08:28,999 --> 01:08:31,079
Well, I was saying, good, that makes me happy.

744
01:08:31,079 --> 01:08:32,360
And so does the agreement.

745
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:33,400
So a lot of people.

746
01:08:33,639 --> 01:08:35,239
I'm playing a while in the head.

747
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:35,639
Okay.

748
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,359
So I'm going back to this.

749
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,520
Where are we now?

750
01:08:40,839 --> 01:08:46,679
This is this is the sense in which you dwell.

751
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:49,560
What I'm trying to say is you dwell in it, not on it.

752
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:52,600
So then you're dying.

753
01:08:52,600 --> 01:09:03,560
Then you're not only perishing, but you are living a certain, an authentic attitude toward the fact that you're a kind of being the characteristic.

754
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:07,639
Let me see what I think from 306 that I want to talk about something.

755
01:09:07,959 --> 01:09:11,480
Well, I just say being towards death is a possibility.

756
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,799
I don't see why that's important.

757
01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:27,679
And it's a way of living the fact or the living the structural possibility of the impossibility of any existence at all, he says on 307.

758
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:36,639
It's not just a way of relating to perishing, but it's a way of relating to perishing as the impossibility of any existence at all.

759
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:41,360
And a specific way of doing that, I think, that we were talking about.

760
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:49,679
Let's see now if I want to say anything more, just so I'm just summing up where I thought we got more or less in agreement.

761
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:51,360
Yeah, I think that's okay.

762
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:55,520
So then I write anxiety gets it right on 310.

763
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,039
Let's see what that is.

764
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:12,399
Anxiety is just being introduced there on 310 in Titalics as the Dasein finds himself face to face with the nothing of the possible impossibility that's existed.

765
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:16,719
That's, I just mentioned, that's the anxiety of death.

766
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:22,399
There's going to be, I mentioned this once before, but keep your eye open for three kinds of anxiety.

767
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:34,079
This one, which this gets defined, there's an anxiety that goes with choice, in which you make a choice, a furious choice, while getting married to one person excludes all the other people you might have married.

768
01:10:34,079 --> 01:10:37,199
And that's an anxious making, I think, for him.

769
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,320
You'll see the choice one.

770
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,280
I don't remember where it is.

771
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,199
It goes by very fast on one page.

772
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,999
He doesn't care about that kind of choice.

773
01:10:43,999 --> 01:10:47,679
And then there's the anxiety of guilt, which we've already talked about.

774
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:57,520
How can I stop the anxiety of guilt that partly that you couldn't get behind your thrilliness, but I don't think that's the whole thing.

775
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:09,959
Well, it is that you can't get behind your throwiness, and that means that everything, the true that might have been guidelines for your existence turns out to be ungrounded.

776
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:12,520
And that's the anxiety of guilt.

777
01:11:13,879 --> 01:11:19,400
You can't make explicit what it is to be an authentic person.

778
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:22,279
And you have to just do it.

779
01:11:22,839 --> 01:11:26,039
And then so then there's this anxiety of death now.

780
01:11:26,039 --> 01:11:40,679
It's what you feel in or the experience of the possibility of the impossibility of your existence.

781
01:11:40,679 --> 01:11:49,400
And then we're right back on page 311, which is so important to me because it says that anxiety can't be depression.

782
01:11:49,400 --> 01:12:02,600
I said this to Bill Blattner because it turns out that anxiety is a disposedness that Dasein, authentic Dasein, is always in.

783
01:12:02,839 --> 01:12:11,959
That's the end of that long thing where it says freedom toward death, a freedom which has been released from the illusions of the day, which is practical, certain of itself, and anxious.

784
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:16,679
That's what you've got when you've got anticipatory resoluteness.

785
01:12:16,679 --> 01:12:21,319
That's the kind of life, the kind of experience you're having of your life.

786
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:26,199
I got stuck on this earlier thing again, rereading that.

787
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,520
Every time you hear one of these things, it looks a bit different.

788
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:32,039
The topic 311, I go back to the beginning of that italics.

789
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:44,039
Anticipation reveals to Dasein its lossness in the day itself and brings it face to face with the possibility of being itself primarily unsupported by concerns or solicitude.

790
01:12:44,039 --> 01:12:56,879
That's you know, I can see that that's just a generalization of that nobody can help you out when you're dying, but this is it's getting toward the wrong one, the strong one that Eugene mentioned.

791
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:01,200
It sounds too isolated and too much like you don't want any.

792
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:27,999
But if you've really got this basic attitude toward demise, if it's demise, and this is your attitude toward it, to put it that way, then you're all alone and you're always anxious, and it sounds so heroic, neoliberal, potentialist, which is what it's always risking being, putting into.

793
01:13:27,999 --> 01:13:37,440
That's why it's important to read the Tara White chapter that I gave you, my version of Tara White, because she's the antidote to that.

794
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:47,999
She's the one who's trying to say, in effect, that's much too personal, isolated, and so forth.

795
01:13:47,999 --> 01:13:53,119
If you want to unpopulize death, it's got to be a much more general phenomenon.

796
01:13:53,120 --> 01:14:02,560
It's got to be, I'll just say it, the possibility of world collapse in your world and in our cultural world collapse.

797
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:09,119
And it's got to be that possibility taken over in a positive way.

798
01:14:09,919 --> 01:14:16,320
Only if you're in the world disposing business, then the fact that your world collapses if you do it right isn't a bad thing at all.

799
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:17,919
It gives you another chance.

800
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:22,400
Or you one way of my slogan is you've got to die in order to be reborn.

801
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:27,199
Christian way of thinking about it.

802
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:42,999
But I mean, that's, I mean, this is much too much of a dark side because you don't get the sense how important it is that your world could collapse or that you could then have the thought that you would that's the vulnerability.

803
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:47,480
The possibility that your identity could collapse, that your world could collapse.

804
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:53,319
It isn't just that you're going to perish someday and go find yourself in the middle of perishing.

805
01:14:53,959 --> 01:15:08,600
Then you can make more sense of how this could be a positive thing, and it just could be a positive thing, but you can't make much sense about why you don't have any support in terms of solicitude.

806
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,600
That just seems too strong.

807
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:13,959
I want to say something more about that just a second.

808
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:16,679
Oh, yeah, I brought along a book I wanted to show you.

809
01:15:16,759 --> 01:15:19,560
I'd tell you at some point.

810
01:15:19,799 --> 01:15:40,440
If you want another slance on the sort of greater Heidegger or the more formal, more ontological issue of world collapse and how to deal with world collapse, and you want to sort of echo of John Hoagland's actually applied.

811
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:41,639
There's this interesting book.

812
01:15:41,799 --> 01:15:47,159
Has anybody seen this, Radical Hope by Jonathan Lear, who's a philosopher at Northwestern?

813
01:15:47,879 --> 01:15:50,279
Yeah, sorry, yes, University of Chicago.

814
01:15:50,280 --> 01:16:14,679
And what it's about is the collapse of the world of the Crow Indians when they were suddenly taken out of their world where they were hunting animals and scalping enemies and put on a reservation so that nothing anymore was worth doing or made any sense because they couldn't do all the things that they used to do, which were heroic and worth doing.

815
01:16:14,679 --> 01:16:21,560
And then what Lear is interested in is how does this world collapse get taken up?

816
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:27,359
And what is the Crow Indians way of doing it versus Fitting Bull's way of doing it?

817
01:16:29,839 --> 01:16:34,319
Hoagland is playing a big role in this, and therefore Heidegger is playing a big role in this at secondhand.

818
01:16:34,639 --> 01:16:47,679
Because what Jonathan Lear is trying to understand is how the group of the Crow Indians was able to help them from the prayer in the face of world collapse.

819
01:16:47,679 --> 01:17:00,639
And if you read it, and you'll see, you get a very interesting sense of, well, I have to tell you, this way we used to give a discussion on this at the American Philosophical Association meeting in March.

820
01:17:00,639 --> 01:17:09,839
I mean, what I'm going to talk about anyway is the fact that Hoagland and Lear don't make a very important distinction.

821
01:17:09,839 --> 01:17:17,520
You can't tell when he says world collapse, what do it with buffalo burgers, which is the way he does it.

822
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:21,119
There are no more buffalo, so you can't have any buffalo burgers.

823
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:31,119
That just means that sort of something in your world is missing and you feel bad about it, and you can feel nostalgic for the good old days when there was buffalo hunting.

824
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:34,719
That's not the Heidegger way of thinking about it.

825
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:37,199
That's probably Jonathan Lear's way of thinking about it.

826
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:48,400
But Hoagland, towards the beginning of the book, is thinking about it in a much more Heideggerian way where it's not meaningful anymore what these Indians do.

827
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:58,639
The whole world of meetings that supports never mind buffalo burgers now, the hunting buffalo and so forth, isn't just that they're no more buffalo to hunt.

828
01:17:59,039 --> 01:18:00,719
Maybe that is the real problem.

829
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:08,199
But the way Hoagland sets up the problem, it means that you can't understand anymore even why you wouldn't want to hunt buffalo.

830
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,480
And the big difference.

831
01:18:09,799 --> 01:18:27,879
Try to think of it this way: that if you've got real-world collapse, and not just you can't find any more buffalo to hunt and eat, real-world collapse, you won't have any nostalgia for the good old days when you had buffalo and you could hunt them and eat them.

832
01:18:27,879 --> 01:18:28,919
And why won't you have that?

833
01:18:28,919 --> 01:18:31,079
And that's what sitting ball is.

834
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,799
Why won't you have that kind of nostalgia?

835
01:18:33,799 --> 01:18:40,119
Because if it was real-world collapse, the whole meaningfulness of the world would be gone.

836
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:41,400
And I'll give you two examples.

837
01:18:41,959 --> 01:18:45,480
Suppose you, it's like falling out of love.

838
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:51,159
I mean, but one, you made, I mean, one thing you could just not be able to get the loved one.

839
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:54,039
I mean, I'm stuck in tears here and trembling, of course.

840
01:18:54,039 --> 01:18:56,679
But anyway, the falling out of love is different.

841
01:18:56,679 --> 01:18:59,079
You can't understand why you ever wanted them.

842
01:18:59,079 --> 01:19:01,959
And you don't feel nostalgic about getting them back.

843
01:19:01,959 --> 01:19:04,440
What would you do with them if you got them back?

844
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:08,520
Well, they're just boring people like everybody else and so forth.

845
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:16,199
So, and you've got to, and this big distinction is you've got to keep in mind if you're thinking about what's happening in the death chapter.

846
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:23,719
The death chapter isn't about some things just happening to become impossible, like buffalo burgers.

847
01:19:23,719 --> 01:19:29,480
It's about a way of life, your way of life, becoming unintelligible.

848
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:31,320
Let me get this across in another way.

849
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:35,159
I mean, the Hoagland example, which is about science.

850
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:48,119
When Newtonian science collapses and you get Einstein in it, or when Aristotle, it's even more dramatic, sort of stopped working for the medievals and Newton copes over.

851
01:19:48,120 --> 01:20:03,839
It isn't as if he could build nostalgic for the good old Aristotelian days or the good old Newtonian days that nobody can even understand why anybody would have believed such a weird thing as that there's the sublunar sphere and the superlunar sphere and things are speaking in their natural place in the middle of the earth.

852
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:07,679
What kind of nonsense is that once you've got Newtonian?

853
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:27,440
And so what this old canton is about, that's because this is sort of the Hobran-Carol White point, is that in your life, and that's the falling in love kind of example, or in the culture, and that would be like what happened to the Indians, if you understand it one way.

854
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:30,879
Never mind, the Indians are so confused because of Jonathan Lear.

855
01:20:30,879 --> 01:20:42,480
What happens in the culture, let's try this the medieval understanding that we're all creatures of God, goes away and you get the modern understanding, thanks to Descartes, we're all self-sufficient subjects.

856
01:20:42,799 --> 01:20:51,119
Then nobody's going to be, who's got it in the modern world, nobody's going to be nostalgic for the good old days when the hills were enchanted and we were all creatures of God.

857
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:57,359
Couldn't even understand why anybody would have believed such a thing, or if they could make any hope to believe such a thing.

858
01:20:57,919 --> 01:20:59,440
Now comes the point.

859
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,079
It's not clear in being in time.

860
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:21,279
When you're thinking about individual world collapse, which is the possibility of known or taught ability, you're thinking of perishing with this thin on it that it's turned into demise because you've got to ban toward it.

861
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:41,239
Or are you thinking of a kind of dying that could happen when you lost your cultural background, your cultural background, or fallen out of love, when your identity is collapsed, or your personal world collapses, or your social world, or your scientific world.

862
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:55,560
What's confusing is Heidegger sometimes seems to have gotten up to the level at which it's so abstract and formal and ontological that he can deal with any form of world collapse.

863
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:59,400
And then it becomes the possibility of no more possibilities.

864
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:02,679
And that doesn't mean on your deathbed.

865
01:22:02,679 --> 01:22:08,280
That means when your world is gone, or your sense of who you are is gone.

866
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:18,119
You can get it by even having a mission that fails, but you can get it even by having a mission that succeeds.

867
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:27,719
When, I mean, when Martin Luther King, let's suppose, really gets justice for the black people, and he's been on the mountain, and he's seen the promised land and all that, and he's ready to die.

868
01:22:27,719 --> 01:22:30,039
It doesn't matter anymore if he says all that.

869
01:22:30,039 --> 01:22:32,520
And then what is he?

870
01:22:32,919 --> 01:22:34,759
But suppose he didn't die.

871
01:22:34,759 --> 01:22:42,759
Well, then he's sort of lost because world collapse doesn't really mean that somehow bad things happen to the world.

872
01:22:42,759 --> 01:22:47,560
It just means that your world doesn't give you anything to do anymore.

873
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:59,480
So if you, if, and Martin Luther King was sort of lost for a while and then he became anti-Vietnam, anti-Vietnam War, and he didn't do that very well because there were no peace marches to call and so forth.

874
01:23:00,999 --> 01:23:07,799
So I think world collapse is so general and supposed to be so general when Heidegger was doing it right.

875
01:23:07,799 --> 01:23:36,480
And this is what I tried to say in the thing I gave out, that anything that causes your world is significant, which grabs you and tells you what's important to do and what's not important to do and what you've got to do now and what you don't have to worry about because it's trivial, when that disappears, however it disappears, that's the kind of thing that death is.

876
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:40,319
And demise, I think, is just a special case of it.

877
01:23:40,320 --> 01:24:05,839
And Heidegger got all too much entangled because describing what happens to people, so to speak, on their deathbed when they're not just perishing, but demising, and worrying about, he could have been worrying about the very general case of what can happen to a Dasein that's revealed in anxiety, namely that their world can collapse.

878
01:24:05,839 --> 01:24:10,799
I mean, what attitude one should, now, and this is what I'm preparing next time without realizing it.

879
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:17,119
What standards could one take in the light of the possibility of world collapse on all these levels?

880
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,999
That's called anticipatory resoluteness.

881
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:30,239
How could you live being the kind of being who has to have a world and has to have a world of the sort that can collapse?

882
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:33,279
That's the really big question for next time.

883
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:33,600
Yeah.

884
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:40,799
The possibility that it's not part of the concept.

885
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:43,280
That's right.

886
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:43,839
That's right.

887
01:24:43,839 --> 01:24:44,399
Good.

888
01:24:45,039 --> 01:24:45,200
Yes.

889
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:46,719
Good, good.

890
01:24:47,600 --> 01:25:11,400
So, what I think, what I understand to write this, I think that he's talking about this very general thing about Dasein, that its world can collapse even though it's not, you know, and he's explained several times in the course of his life, but he gets hooked on a kind of paradigm page for world collapse, which is this thing that happens to people at the end of their life.

891
01:25:11,959 --> 01:25:24,679
But I think that when he gets it really formalized, namely the possibility of having no more possibilities, that's what happened to the Crow-Indians, and I think he should stay at that level.

892
01:25:24,679 --> 01:25:28,679
And one thing is poor, and again, read the thing that Carol White is so good on.

893
01:25:28,839 --> 01:25:34,999
Heidegger Later is more interested in the death of civilizations than he is in the death of Dasein.

894
01:25:34,999 --> 01:25:37,159
How could he, what's the connection?

895
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:44,520
Well, civilizations can collapse that where it doesn't mean anything anymore to do whatever they were doing.

896
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:47,159
That ought to fall under this.

897
01:25:47,959 --> 01:26:00,839
Yet, this path that you're reading, and it's the one we should be paying attention to, and I'll go back to it now to paying attention to it, is certainly using demise.

898
01:26:01,079 --> 01:26:11,719
This one time was ungetaroundable, what I always say, inevitable thing that's going to happen to Dasein.

899
01:26:11,719 --> 01:26:24,999
It's not inevitable that your identity is going to collapse, your love is going to collapse, your world is going to collapse, your science is going to collapse, but there's something inevitable, namely the thing that happens when you're on your deathbed.

900
01:26:24,999 --> 01:26:26,520
Now, now you want to sort of come.

901
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:34,200
Yes, I'll take that so well.

902
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:35,240
Yes, good.

903
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:36,280
Yes, that's right.

904
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:39,639
Death an example, a paradigm case.

905
01:26:39,639 --> 01:26:49,560
For mine is a paradigm case of world collapse, but the possibility of having no more possibilities is not an event.

906
01:26:50,839 --> 01:27:01,200
Okay, but but I'm a little worried because, in a certain way, world falling out of love and getting from the medieval to the modern world is an event.

907
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:05,039
It takes a while, but it was dying sometimes.

908
01:27:05,759 --> 01:27:09,520
And it's a funny kind of event.

909
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:11,360
I wrote something about that.

910
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:13,360
Let me go back then because I skipped it.

911
01:27:14,079 --> 01:27:18,239
You know, you could, I mean, it's not an event, and yet it is an event.

912
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:23,279
But the possibility of that is, also, the possibility of that is not an event.

913
01:27:24,959 --> 01:27:27,200
I don't know how to get a possibility of that.

914
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:28,560
Okay, that's right.

915
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:40,719
So you should, whenever you hear about the possibility of no more possibilities, you should think of the vulnerability of your identity, of your culture, of your life.

916
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:43,600
That vulnerability is not an event.

917
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,039
See, that's what you're saying, right?

918
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:51,759
The event is the actual collapse of those things, and that happens too.

919
01:27:51,759 --> 01:27:56,159
And okay, now, well, I don't know what to think.

920
01:27:56,719 --> 01:27:59,039
Well, I haven't, you had your hand up every once in a while.

921
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:10,319
Part of the minds is dying, but I mean, for example, world collapse in the general sense that you're talking about, is that also non-relational to us?

922
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,719
No, and that's one of the problems.

923
01:28:16,799 --> 01:28:20,560
I think you're pointing at a problem from a kind of angle.

924
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:31,279
Namely, if you make this event that happens at the end of people's lives, your paradigm, you've got to be careful of what you say about it.

925
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:34,799
For instance, you couldn't say it's non-relational.

926
01:28:34,799 --> 01:28:41,560
I don't know what it means for, you know, a call for collapsing being non-relational or falling out of love.

927
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:43,879
Maybe that's non-relational, I'm not sure.

928
01:28:43,879 --> 01:29:14,440
But there are certain, I mean, what I would like anyway is that he could give us the general ontological condition of how anything that the world becomes impossible and tell us how we could live in such a way that we are constantly expressing in what we're doing that we're the kind of creatures whose world can become impossible.

929
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:15,879
That's what he could be doing.

930
01:29:15,879 --> 01:29:25,319
But if he sticks to the example of what happens on your deathbed, then I don't think non-relational is the right thing to say.

931
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:33,639
I also don't think inevitable is the right thing to say, because some people get through their whole lives without any collapse except for the one at the end of it.

932
01:29:33,639 --> 01:29:40,200
Whereas I want, and therefore, inevitable, and you say it's inevitable, it's all just collapse.

933
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:40,999
I'm not sure.

934
01:29:40,999 --> 01:29:41,719
I don't know.

935
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:44,679
It's not as inevitable as anything.

936
01:29:44,679 --> 01:29:50,919
It does think it would have been the case, though, though time is going on pretty well still after several thousand years.

937
01:29:51,240 --> 01:30:28,480
So you have to look, if you're interested in this, as you read it, ask yourself which of these characteristics of death or dying are applicable only to the event at the end of people's lives and which are general enough and ontological enough that they apply to a kind of being who, as long as it's as it is, is vulnerable to a collapse of all that makes its life meaningful.

938
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:34,799
That gives it a world, what gives it significance, that that's constantly vulnerable.

939
01:30:35,039 --> 01:30:36,560
But now, I'll let, yeah, yeah?

940
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:48,560
Demise, the dawn of the people on the aspect of demise, is that part of the harmonic that you think is necessary for kind of reaping the authenticity?

941
01:30:48,799 --> 01:30:51,679
Death in general type of general understanding?

942
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:53,199
That's interesting.

943
01:30:53,200 --> 01:31:01,839
Sorry, I have a kind of gay feeling that you've asked me this question before in some words, but I really think about it and ask it again.

944
01:31:02,079 --> 01:31:04,480
That's sidetracked by my feeling that I heard it before.

945
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:05,039
Say to you.

946
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:15,999
Paragraphic case, which is demise, is necessary for the harmonic general part of the formalized case to get to a general understanding of learning.

947
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:17,200
I see that's a good question.

948
01:31:17,919 --> 01:31:26,320
Already have a good grip on demise, and that be his way into or not find his way into a general understanding.

949
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:28,079
That's good.

950
01:31:28,079 --> 01:31:29,759
That would be the right way to do it.

951
01:31:29,759 --> 01:31:45,360
To start with the cover-up, namely the therapy, and then see that that's not the question, but that demise is the question, that that's not the event, that that's not an event necessarily at the end of your life.

952
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:48,159
You may have several, I think.

953
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:49,839
Then you generalize some more.

954
01:31:49,839 --> 01:31:58,639
There is that event at the end of your life, and it's inevitable, but you're still doing harmonious formal indication, and you see that that's still not the phenomenon.

955
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:02,399
That's not a cover-up anymore, but that's not the right whole story.

956
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:18,279
Then you see that even cultures can die and so forth, and then you finally get to the basic realization that that there's a certain kind of being whose world who has to have a world that has to have significance and can lose it.

957
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:31,400
Then you finally see that that's what the essential feature we're going to call death is, which I've covered up in several stages and we've uncovered it in several stages.

958
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:33,239
I'm answering you all right.

959
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:41,959
So, okay, now let me go on for a while because I'm going to discover that it's 4:30 and I haven't even done covered half of what I want to cover.

960
01:32:41,959 --> 01:32:45,319
So I think I've got a lot of it covered, but let me look.

961
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:51,079
Did we look at 291, which is where I claim, I think we did.

962
01:32:51,079 --> 01:32:51,879
Oh, yeah, we did that.

963
01:32:51,879 --> 01:32:52,839
That's fine.

964
01:32:52,839 --> 01:32:57,399
It's Dasein and Demise is not an event.

965
01:32:57,719 --> 01:32:58,520
But look at this.

966
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:01,959
I've written this down now, kind of seemed to contradict myself.

967
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:07,319
Dasein is demise is not an event, not a future event.

968
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:14,600
That's true, because it's not something that you can ever experience your own demise.

969
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:16,279
Remember, we talked about that.

970
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:27,799
So this is an argument about demise, particularly, that it has a peculiar character of not because I said it's wrong to tell it's a cover-up.

971
01:33:27,799 --> 01:33:30,679
That demise is something that happens in the future.

972
01:33:30,679 --> 01:33:39,079
And we've been saying, oh yeah, but if demise is perishing, but from a certain perspective, then it looks like it is something that happens in the future.

973
01:33:39,079 --> 01:33:42,360
And I think he's got an interesting view about that.

974
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:43,480
So let me look.

975
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:52,879
I think he thinks, well, you're going to speak from the outside and not as a s some thing that you're experiencing.

976
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:57,919
Demise is an event that happens in people's future, and it's an event that will happen in your future.

977
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:06,079
But it's never something that will actually happen in your future, because when it happens, you'll be dead, and you can't experience it as an event.

978
01:34:06,079 --> 01:34:09,119
And he's got that in mind on 284.

979
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:12,639
I don't know why I think it's important, but I so let's see now.

980
01:34:12,959 --> 01:34:16,399
The end of the paragraph: Dasein is not an event.

981
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:22,959
It's a phenomenon to be understood existentially, and to be understood in a distinctive thing, which must still be, okay.

982
01:34:22,959 --> 01:34:25,360
So, let me see now.

983
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:26,639
Dying is not an event.

984
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:28,560
Is that about demise?

985
01:34:29,039 --> 01:34:32,560
Is that telling us that demise is not an event?

986
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:41,039
Certainly, dying is not an event, if that means it's being always vulnerable.

987
01:34:41,039 --> 01:34:44,799
But I think he thinks that even demise isn't an event.

988
01:34:44,799 --> 01:34:46,639
Let me see if I can find that.

989
01:34:47,919 --> 01:34:49,600
Look like 295.

990
01:34:51,839 --> 01:34:59,279
There's a peculiar way, I think, I'm just trying to say this, in which world collapse is unintelligible.

991
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:02,799
Because when you're in it, you can't make any sense out of it.

992
01:35:02,799 --> 01:35:09,600
And you're either in a world or you're lost, and then there's a kind of leap and you're in another world.

993
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:10,639
Let me see if I find it.

994
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:12,959
295, the name can say something, Chris.

995
01:35:12,959 --> 01:35:29,679
And I want to say something about this framework, this weird stuff on 294 in the paragraph that has 251 written beside it.

996
01:35:29,879 --> 01:35:33,719
Rise of ability to be dodzine cannot outstrip the possibility of death.

997
01:35:33,719 --> 01:35:38,759
Death is the possibility of the absolute impossibility of dodging.

998
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:45,560
Thus death reveals itself as that possibility which is one's own low sorts of non-errational Datre scripts.

999
01:35:45,719 --> 01:35:51,319
As such, death is something distinctively impending.

1000
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:52,999
So that's a funny thing.

1001
01:35:53,079 --> 01:35:55,079
That's what I got puzzled about.

1002
01:35:55,480 --> 01:36:01,480
Really, everything is just plain something impending.

1003
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:09,159
But demise is something distinctively impending.

1004
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:14,279
What I want to say is, you can't even imagine it happening.

1005
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:19,959
It's not something you can expect or await or even avoid.

1006
01:36:19,959 --> 01:36:26,679
That's why you cover it up with this parity that you can expect and be afraid of and avoid and so forth.

1007
01:36:26,679 --> 01:36:36,359
You can't, since you can't imagine what it would be like not to be in love with this person while you are, or what it would be like not to be a modern person while you are.

1008
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:49,719
There's a sense in which you can't really have a sense of that collapse as something that's going to happen in the future because you can't have a sense of what that collapse is going to you that makes collapse makes no sense.

1009
01:36:49,719 --> 01:36:55,639
That's what the collapse of all intelligibility, though it actually happens, can't be something you can think about.

1010
01:36:55,639 --> 01:36:59,959
Wow, what would it happen if all the meaning of being me would disappear?

1011
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:06,119
So what's the sense in which it's distinctively impending?

1012
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:08,280
You can say, yes, it could always happen.

1013
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:09,400
It can happen anytime.

1014
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:10,999
It could happen right away.

1015
01:37:10,999 --> 01:37:13,480
And you can't picture that it could happen at all.

1016
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:14,919
You're looking at puzzling.

1017
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:19,280
But I realize, but how big do you distinguish between dying and lying?

1018
01:37:19,959 --> 01:37:21,360
Okay, I keep mixing it up, you should.

1019
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:22,639
You say I think you think.

1020
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:23,600
I do, I okay.

1021
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:24,639
Yes.

1022
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:27,119
Yes.

1023
01:37:27,759 --> 01:37:31,039
Dying is a kind of way of acting.

1024
01:37:31,039 --> 01:37:32,079
It's a way of life.

1025
01:37:32,079 --> 01:37:33,679
Dying is a way of life.

1026
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:43,359
Dying is what anticipatory resoluteness is a name for that way of life.

1027
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:44,400
That's dying.

1028
01:37:45,039 --> 01:37:48,159
Perricing, we get protein.

1029
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:52,959
And demise is what?

1030
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:54,400
World collapsing.

1031
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:55,919
World collapsing, right.

1032
01:37:55,919 --> 01:37:59,679
As opposed to the possibility of world collapsing, I take it.

1033
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:01,119
Yes.

1034
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:05,999
So the oncological structure of death is the constant possibility of world collapse.

1035
01:38:05,999 --> 01:38:09,600
When there is something called world collapse, I don't know what his name for it is.

1036
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:10,320
What, dying?

1037
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:13,119
No, such as we just use dying.

1038
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:13,600
Right.

1039
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:17,999
So what is the name for actual world collapsing?

1040
01:38:17,999 --> 01:38:18,400
That must.

1041
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:20,079
Well, that part of the little confusion.

1042
01:38:20,079 --> 01:38:23,600
I don't know whether you can preserve it in dying for a certain time, what happens during your life?

1043
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:25,039
Okay.

1044
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:29,600
Demise, it seems, is a stand you take on parroting.

1045
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:33,199
At least the way it comes up when he introduces it.

1046
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:41,119
And maybe we should think that also gets generalized, so that after all, well, we talked about that, cultures can die and so forth.

1047
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:46,079
So the demise better be a name for the event of world collapsing.

1048
01:38:46,079 --> 01:38:49,919
That's why, yes, he started terminal world collapsing.

1049
01:38:49,919 --> 01:38:50,400
Yes.

1050
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:52,239
Okay, so let's get that for everybody.

1051
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:54,799
Demise is terminal world collapsing.

1052
01:38:54,799 --> 01:39:04,480
Dying is the poss is a way of life in the face of the possibility of terminal world collapsing.

1053
01:39:04,799 --> 01:39:05,839
Sounds right.

1054
01:39:05,839 --> 01:39:06,639
Okay.

1055
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:10,039
Wait now, where are you?

1056
01:39:11,639 --> 01:39:12,279
Where?

1057
01:39:13,879 --> 01:39:15,320
Okay, now okay.

1058
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:18,839
We designate the intermediate phenomenon as demise.

1059
01:39:18,839 --> 01:39:20,279
What's the phenomenon?

1060
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:22,039
What's that?

1061
01:39:22,999 --> 01:39:28,440
It's in between perishing and world collapsing.

1062
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:30,440
World collapsing is dying.

1063
01:39:30,839 --> 01:39:34,520
This event at the end of people's lives is perishing.

1064
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:42,199
And in between, I guess I'm all right, is the actual not the possibility I misspoke again, didn't I?

1065
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:42,600
Yes.

1066
01:39:42,919 --> 01:39:45,320
Yeah, possibility of world collapsing, I keep wondering.

1067
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:52,039
Dying is living a certain way of life which takes account of the constant possibility of world collapsing.

1068
01:39:52,039 --> 01:39:52,919
That's right.

1069
01:39:52,919 --> 01:40:05,719
When there is this intermediate phenomenon, actual world collapsing, then there is this terminal phenomena for organisms and maybe propulsive food.

1070
01:40:06,999 --> 01:40:07,480
Right?

1071
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:10,919
No, no, no, but demise we need.

1072
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:13,399
Oh, demise is world collapsing, right?

1073
01:40:13,639 --> 01:40:30,360
And there and being on your deathbed and ceasing to be alive is a case of world collapsing, actually happening, wi which we call demise.

1074
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:32,600
It's a special case of world collapsing, I think.

1075
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:33,400
Does that make sense?

1076
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:35,320
It's the kind that happens to people on their deathbed.

1077
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:36,360
We didn't say that last time.

1078
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:39,319
We said any time a culture dies, it's a demise.

1079
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:52,199
And there's other kinds of both.

1080
01:40:57,999 --> 01:41:06,480
Yeah, I think he does it because the way he set it up, demise is seems to be taking a stand on perishing.

1081
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:11,520
If that's true, then he thinks only this special terminal one is demise.

1082
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:14,639
And then we just haven't got a word for a world collapse, have we?

1083
01:41:14,639 --> 01:41:24,959
I mean, if we sort it out that way, we need a word for what happens to you when everything that gave your life meaning goes away.

1084
01:41:25,919 --> 01:41:26,560
Right?

1085
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:28,159
Dying.

1086
01:41:28,879 --> 01:41:30,639
Dying is a way of acting.

1087
01:41:30,959 --> 01:41:32,400
Yeah, now I got you confused.

1088
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:33,600
Okay, that's bad.

1089
01:41:34,879 --> 01:41:35,839
Yes, yes, you're right.

1090
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:37,359
You're right.

1091
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:38,560
You're right.

1092
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:40,959
The demise is.

1093
01:41:41,039 --> 01:41:43,280
But then again, you keep saying it in a way that confuses me.

1094
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:46,719
Demise is not a stance you take on world collapsing.

1095
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:50,560
Demise is world collapsing viewed in a certain way.

1096
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:51,759
There's not another.

1097
01:41:55,759 --> 01:41:56,719
Oh, I misspoke.

1098
01:41:57,039 --> 01:41:57,839
I'm sorry.

1099
01:41:58,639 --> 01:42:01,280
Demise is heroing viewed in a certain way.

1100
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:05,199
Heroicing is an event that happens to organisms at the end of their life.

1101
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:18,239
That very event taken up and interpreted and lived in a certain way is, if you look at the end of, if something happens at the end of people's lives, that's you're going to call heriting.

1102
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:33,360
But dying is a way of life, namely how you integrate into your life not only the possibility of that kind of perishing, but the general possibility of having no more possibilities.

1103
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:34,560
Is that all right?

1104
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:54,200
I think that I wish he did, but I think in fact he's got demise on his mind in here, which is a simple kind of terminal world collapse, which is happens to people on their deathbed, but within an interpretation.

1105
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:57,079
But here's my question, and then we've got to stop going around in this.

1106
01:42:57,400 --> 01:43:14,199
What is the world, what is his term for this more general ontological, absolute possibility of no more possibilities, which could cover world collapsing this deathbed phenomenon?

1107
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:15,719
I don't know it.

1108
01:43:16,999 --> 01:43:18,039
That's death.

1109
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:19,480
Maybe that's death.

1110
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:21,799
I actually, okay, that's, I think you're right.

1111
01:43:21,799 --> 01:43:23,240
Maybe we should write that on the board.

1112
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:27,560
Now we may have an, but I've never understood how far all these words gave out.

1113
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:31,719
So there's everything, there's demise.

1114
01:43:32,839 --> 01:43:35,159
I don't know how to spell it, but that's all right for the moment.

1115
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:40,199
There's possibility of no more possibilities.

1116
01:43:41,879 --> 01:43:42,679
Is that death?

1117
01:43:42,839 --> 01:43:43,480
No.

1118
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:44,839
Death is, is it?

1119
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:47,159
What did you come up with as death?

1120
01:43:47,719 --> 01:43:52,039
I mean, what have anybody else think about the possibility of death?

1121
01:43:52,039 --> 01:43:54,280
I mean, I think you defined it as the possible.

1122
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:56,199
That's death.

1123
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:58,039
Okay, let's try that.

1124
01:43:59,079 --> 01:43:59,879
Where's red?

1125
01:44:00,039 --> 01:44:05,400
And that means this is also possible world collapse, right?

1126
01:44:06,039 --> 01:44:08,199
Possible world collapse.

1127
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:11,079
Okay, and now we've got actual world collapse.

1128
01:44:11,079 --> 01:44:11,719
And what's the name?

1129
01:44:11,959 --> 01:44:13,480
You said the name for that is death.

1130
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:15,879
That's what's confusing me now.

1131
01:44:15,879 --> 01:44:16,119
Right?

1132
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:18,879
So we don't have a name for actual world collapse.

1133
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:20,320
And we have this possible.

1134
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:22,480
I thought it was a great.

1135
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:25,679
Well, I thought it was a big breakthrough to put death down here.

1136
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:34,079
And I think possibility of no more possibilities is dying, isn't it?

1137
01:44:34,079 --> 01:44:36,079
Dying is a way of being, right?

1138
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:38,159
Possibility is our.

1139
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:40,320
Which of these is death?

1140
01:44:40,879 --> 01:44:46,639
Death is a possibility of no more possibilities.

1141
01:44:46,639 --> 01:44:48,719
So maybe Curtis is right.

1142
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:54,959
Since he doesn't care about this, I mean, you need to talk about world collapse.

1143
01:44:54,959 --> 01:45:00,239
Up here, everything gives you the event to talk about.

1144
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:02,879
And this is what the event interpreted.

1145
01:45:02,879 --> 01:45:05,039
This gives you the structure.

1146
01:45:05,039 --> 01:45:22,560
It looks like you would want to have a name for the more general event, that this is a special case of, where this is what happens to individual Dodd Zions on their deathbed, this is something that can happen to cultures and everything.

1147
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:23,999
What do you think?

1148
01:45:23,999 --> 01:45:24,240
Yeah?

1149
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:26,239
Everything is the end of life, right?

1150
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:27,199
Yes.

1151
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:28,480
Yes.

1152
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:30,480
Anyway, let's put that up here.

1153
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:31,759
End of life.

1154
01:45:32,079 --> 01:45:34,879
And here's the end of Dodzy.

1155
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:40,320
And this is what, I'll say, down here is the possibility of absolutely no more possibilities.

1156
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:41,679
What do you want?

1157
01:45:41,679 --> 01:45:43,360
Where do you have world collapse?

1158
01:45:44,079 --> 01:45:46,400
And you want to point out the world collapse.

1159
01:45:46,639 --> 01:45:48,079
He never says that.

1160
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:49,280
But that's all right.

1161
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:50,959
We say that.

1162
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:52,959
Having no more possibilities.

1163
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:54,159
Your whole world breaks down.

1164
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:55,759
You can't have another double circle.

1165
01:45:55,759 --> 01:45:56,560
You can have another world.

1166
01:45:56,639 --> 01:45:57,039
That's right.

1167
01:45:57,039 --> 01:45:58,079
It's not terminal.

1168
01:45:58,039 --> 01:46:06,079
That's what's interesting about this is this is the possibility of no more possibilities, um and this is death.

1169
01:46:06,079 --> 01:46:08,520
And this is terminal.

1170
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:16,600
Well, this this isn't terminal because this is a possibility this is the possibility of no more possibilities.

1171
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:20,919
If it's the first to it, this is terminal, this is terminal, right?

1172
01:46:20,919 --> 01:46:23,319
This is a a possibility.

1173
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:29,719
And this is actual world collapse, which is like a revolution.

1174
01:46:31,079 --> 01:46:32,759
We don't have a name for it.

1175
01:46:32,759 --> 01:46:36,360
But it's it's we call it world collapse.

1176
01:46:36,360 --> 01:46:41,639
And if it's noticed, by the way, just it's terminal in a certain sense.

1177
01:46:41,639 --> 01:46:44,919
I mean, it's the end of that whole mode of intelligibility.

1178
01:46:44,919 --> 01:46:47,319
It's you can't get it back and so forth.

1179
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:52,919
But it's not terminal for the culture, for the person undergoing it, because they can do it several times.

1180
01:46:53,079 --> 01:46:55,399
They can fall in love and collapse.

1181
01:46:56,759 --> 01:46:57,239
Yes.

1182
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:07,719
Yeah, but what's interesting is the structure of this one, which is really the important one.

1183
01:47:07,719 --> 01:47:11,399
I mean, this one is just one instance of this one.

1184
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:12,119
Okay, for most.

1185
01:47:14,120 --> 01:47:14,919
What's that?

1186
01:47:15,240 --> 01:47:16,839
World collapse is before demise.

1187
01:47:16,839 --> 01:47:18,679
You mean it's more general when there is up here?

1188
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:20,359
Okay.

1189
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:25,959
Okay, I don't I don't think it's what the impact, you know, during your life.

1190
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:31,480
You know, they got those back.

1191
01:47:31,799 --> 01:47:35,719
Okay, well, and I suppose, yeah.

1192
01:47:36,039 --> 01:47:39,079
When I make it stronger, you can say, well, it collapses the end of you.

1193
01:47:39,079 --> 01:47:39,240
Right?

1194
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:40,119
That's why.

1195
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:41,879
End of you, well, okay.

1196
01:47:42,039 --> 01:47:47,399
Possibility, a world collapse of you.

1197
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:49,159
That's right.

1198
01:47:50,360 --> 01:47:52,520
It's yes, you get a new that could be.

1199
01:47:52,240 --> 01:48:02,959
Dasein can go through these ends of you several times with anxiety, falling out of love, losing all your chance to hunt buffalo, and so forth.

1200
01:48:02,959 --> 01:48:03,999
Yeah, okay.

1201
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:05,839
Dying, you know, dying, that's right.

1202
01:48:05,839 --> 01:48:06,480
Let's put it in.

1203
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:07,520
Let's put it in there.

1204
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:09,679
Dying, we said, was here.

1205
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:22,639
It's the way of life in count of this, right?

1206
01:48:22,959 --> 01:48:24,959
In all your behaving.

1207
01:48:24,959 --> 01:48:26,639
We'll see that clearer next time.

1208
01:48:26,799 --> 01:48:31,600
Takes account of vulnerability.

1209
01:48:31,919 --> 01:48:35,440
Ability, the world, the world collapse.

1210
01:48:36,079 --> 01:48:37,839
This is dying, right?

1211
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:41,279
So let's put your dying over here.

1212
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:44,879
Somebody write this down for me so I know what I've committed myself to.

1213
01:48:44,879 --> 01:48:46,719
If anybody can read it, let me try to read it.

1214
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:50,879
Perishing, the end of life, demise, the end of.

1215
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:52,639
What have I got here?

1216
01:48:52,959 --> 01:48:54,319
Dasein.

1217
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:57,119
Okay, end of Dasein.

1218
01:48:57,120 --> 01:49:00,799
The possibilities of no more possibilities.

1219
01:49:00,799 --> 01:49:02,239
That's death.

1220
01:49:02,240 --> 01:49:05,119
That's lots of a world collapse.

1221
01:49:05,759 --> 01:49:07,759
Dying is a way of life.

1222
01:49:07,759 --> 01:49:13,679
It's a way of life that takes account of the vulnerability to world collapse.

1223
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:24,560
Then finally, there is something natural world collapse, the end of you for which we don't seem to have a word other than natural world collapse.

1224
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:27,919
Okay, did you write this down or could you, please?

1225
01:49:27,919 --> 01:49:28,480
Okay.

1226
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:30,079
Now, now I'm going to go on.

1227
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:33,200
If there is any place to go, on from here, let's see.

1228
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:35,759
15 minutes, I can see how much I have to cover.

1229
01:49:35,759 --> 01:49:37,079
Yeah, I think I can do this.

1230
01:49:37,079 --> 01:49:40,999
Back to Donaldson's Stalinist way of life.

1231
01:49:40,999 --> 01:49:41,159
Huh?

1232
01:49:36,719 --> 01:49:43,480
That's just where I asked for what would be.

1233
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:46,600
Okay, let's try this.

1234
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:50,839
Now, just as guilt is supposed to make possible, oh, yeah, this is a terrible for me.

1235
01:49:51,879 --> 01:49:57,560
I'm giving this really as a course of a feminine or something, you're supposed to help me understand this stuff.

1236
01:49:57,560 --> 01:49:58,919
So, and you are helping now.

1237
01:49:58,919 --> 01:49:59,639
You can think of it.

1238
01:49:59,719 --> 01:50:04,119
So, well, all this or this is going to go into the second edition of the commentary.

1239
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:05,799
All right, it helped a lot.

1240
01:50:05,799 --> 01:50:07,639
Now, I need help with the following.

1241
01:50:07,799 --> 01:50:14,600
So, the final move that Heidegger makes, we're back to formal indication now, and we're back to guilt.

1242
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:25,799
It turns out that the cover-up story is made possible by and motivated by the new story.

1243
01:50:25,799 --> 01:50:43,480
That is, so this ontological guilt, he says, is the prediction of the possibility of having, of owing people money, of doing bad things that you feel guilty about, of having caused a loss which you now have to fix.

1244
01:50:43,480 --> 01:50:56,199
Why is the fact that you can't get behind your throneness and that there is no ground for what you're doing the prediction of the possibility of the ordinary meaning of guilt?

1245
01:50:56,200 --> 01:51:08,600
Where that doesn't mean now that it motivates that meaning, we saw that, that's right, fleeing motivates the cover-up by telling you that there are all kinds of laws that you better not violate.

1246
01:51:08,919 --> 01:51:16,919
How does this ontological structure called guilt make possible the everyday understanding of guilt?

1247
01:51:16,959 --> 01:51:22,319
And I hope somebody knows, because every year I go through and I don't know, and you guys are supposed to help me.

1248
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:24,719
And then, oh, why do you can't figure that one out?

1249
01:51:21,879 --> 01:51:26,639
Think how much harder the next one is.

1250
01:51:26,959 --> 01:51:41,679
So it looks like dying, that is living, where's dying now here, living a life that takes account of vulnerability made, how to make demise possible.

1251
01:51:41,999 --> 01:51:42,719
Yes.

1252
01:51:43,919 --> 01:52:19,759
The thing that you started with in your formal invocation as what everybody thinks is guilt, and now the thing that everybody thinks is death, namely the event that happens to you at the end of your life, in which your world collapses for good, it looks like that meaning that everybody's thought that there is this event and it ends your life, you have no more possibilities, ought to be no, sorry, start again.

1253
01:52:19,759 --> 01:52:34,480
That the fact that you are vulnerable, but that you can express in your behavior your vulnerability, and then you live in anticipatory resoluteness, perhaps the structure, the ontological structure.

1254
01:52:34,799 --> 01:52:47,759
How does that make possible having a sense of demise and having an interpretation of your part of parity as demise?

1255
01:52:47,759 --> 01:52:51,679
Maybe when I say it, it doesn't sound so crazy as I thought.

1256
01:52:51,679 --> 01:52:55,759
So why do we understand parity as demise?

1257
01:52:56,719 --> 01:53:00,959
Not only because we're fleeting.

1258
01:53:00,959 --> 01:53:04,319
And sorry, oh, nobody's talking that nonsense.

1259
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:05,839
Now let'm going to start again.

1260
01:53:05,839 --> 01:53:13,239
Why do we understand the end of our life as demise?

1261
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:14,839
That's the question.

1262
01:53:14,839 --> 01:53:39,399
And the answer is supposed to be because structurally we are the possibility of our understanding the end of our life as demise is that we have we are vulnerable to world collapse.

1263
01:53:39,719 --> 01:53:43,400
And yeah, I mean I'm beginning to believe that there's something here.

1264
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:47,400
Why are we thinking of our perishing as special?

1265
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:49,799
Not just like all animals perishing.

1266
01:53:49,799 --> 01:53:56,199
It's because we are the beings who are vulnerable to world collapse.

1267
01:53:56,200 --> 01:54:08,199
And now you read that back in and you are able, you are led to interpret perishing as something special, namely demise, namely world collapse.

1268
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:10,440
So what, I'm just working it out.

1269
01:54:10,440 --> 01:54:45,480
So what the formal indication finally discovered for death really was, namely the possibility of no more possibilities, gets read back into perishing and demise meaning we come up with the idea that what death is really about is an event in which where it are where there are no more telling.

1270
01:54:45,480 --> 01:54:46,759
Is this an event?

1271
01:54:47,079 --> 01:54:49,319
Yes, this is an event, isn't it?

1272
01:54:49,639 --> 01:54:55,039
Demise, the end of Dasein, it's an event.

1273
01:54:55,039 --> 01:54:57,679
And this is an event.

1274
01:54:52,280 --> 01:54:58,159
Dying.

1275
01:54:58,480 --> 01:55:01,279
No, this, the actual world collapse.

1276
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:31,679
But when we come to understand that there is an actual possibility of world collapse, when we understand that living in it is death, then now we ought to get to, then we understand why, I think almost getting it, why we have almost, why we have to take a stand on perishing and why we just don't perish like animals.

1277
01:55:31,679 --> 01:55:45,839
It's got to do with ontological structure that we've discovered, is somehow making us able to see our perishing as a special thing.

1278
01:55:45,839 --> 01:55:47,199
I just about got it.

1279
01:55:47,839 --> 01:55:49,200
Is in each place mine?

1280
01:55:50,240 --> 01:55:59,679
The possibility of world collapse, demise, ending of Dasein, event, let's say, each place mine, that makes it demise.

1281
01:55:59,679 --> 01:56:01,119
It's what happens to me.

1282
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:04,959
I put to my death on my deathbed.

1283
01:56:04,959 --> 01:56:07,520
Well, yeah, I mean, that helps.

1284
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:11,280
Now, did we, I mean, I wish we had gotten as far as that with guilt.

1285
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:11,999
We didn't, did we?

1286
01:56:11,999 --> 01:56:22,959
Nobody came up with an idea why the fact that you can't get behind the thronus and everything is ungrounded makes possible owing people things and feeling feeling guilty.

1287
01:56:22,959 --> 01:56:24,240
I just don't know what to say about that.

1288
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:25,679
You want to say something about it?

1289
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:29,999
You can't suddenly die and don't have an opportunity to have a woman who lives as well.

1290
01:56:29,999 --> 01:56:30,560
It doesn't.

1291
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:32,879
Yes, I think that's right.

1292
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:35,360
You can perish without actually dying.

1293
01:56:35,360 --> 01:56:36,480
Doesn't it just say that?

1294
01:56:43,079 --> 01:56:44,280
You said Daseine can.

1295
01:56:45,079 --> 01:56:49,079
Wait, wait, you said we should, did the sentence say that we can perish only while we're dying?

1296
01:56:49,079 --> 01:56:50,119
No, don't think that.

1297
01:56:50,360 --> 01:56:51,560
That's right, good.

1298
01:56:51,879 --> 01:56:54,520
Daseine can demise.

1299
01:56:54,520 --> 01:56:57,959
Daseine can demise only as long as it's dying.

1300
01:56:57,959 --> 01:57:00,199
Did we write ever dying on here?

1301
01:57:01,160 --> 01:57:03,079
Dying is where's dying?

1302
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:04,919
No, you're dying, fine.

1303
01:57:04,919 --> 01:57:05,480
Okay.

1304
01:57:05,480 --> 01:57:10,759
Daseine demise only as long as it's dying.

1305
01:57:10,919 --> 01:57:13,079
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense to me.

1306
01:57:13,639 --> 01:57:27,799
That is, if it's living in a life that takes account of its vulnerability to world collapse, which is exactly the issue for next time, the life you've called anticipatory resoluteness, but we don't know what that is yet.

1307
01:57:27,799 --> 01:57:41,959
As long as it's living this kind of life, then it can understand that it's not an animal that perishes, but it's about a special way of doing somebody we call demise.

1308
01:57:41,959 --> 01:57:43,239
Is that what you're just saying?

1309
01:57:43,240 --> 01:57:45,319
And that fits the line you just read.

1310
01:57:45,480 --> 01:57:46,600
That's okay.

1311
01:57:47,240 --> 01:57:48,119
That's okay.

1312
01:57:48,839 --> 01:57:52,600
So, and I think I've just come to the end of what I want to say here, and I'm not a thing.

1313
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:54,919
Dying makes life possible.

1314
01:57:55,560 --> 01:57:56,280
What did you just read?

1315
01:57:56,360 --> 01:57:57,239
291?

1316
01:57:57,240 --> 01:57:57,719
Yes.

1317
01:57:57,719 --> 01:57:59,639
That's what that's the next thing in my notes.

1318
01:58:00,839 --> 01:58:03,639
Okay, how many T, I've got only two more sentences.

1319
01:58:05,480 --> 01:58:07,239
So I'm just repeating myself.

1320
01:58:07,959 --> 01:58:15,639
What we need now is to describe the way the permanent possibility, no more possibility, permeates my life.

1321
01:58:15,799 --> 01:58:17,879
That's what we call dying.

1322
01:58:20,039 --> 01:58:23,759
And that's anti-preparatory resolution.

1323
01:58:25,759 --> 01:58:30,799
And also, I think it would help if everybody read the paper I gave out.

1324
01:58:30,799 --> 01:58:37,919
Now that you've heard all this, you'll see how that will sort of crystallize in your mind what we've been talking about.

1325
01:58:37,919 --> 01:58:39,679
Anything else anybody needs to say?

1326
01:58:39,679 --> 01:58:40,799
You want to make the last remark?

1327
01:58:40,799 --> 01:58:41,839
It's okay with me.

1328
01:58:41,839 --> 01:58:42,319
Yeah.

1329
01:58:44,959 --> 01:58:47,839
That's the possibility and the other possibilities.

1330
01:58:47,839 --> 01:58:49,679
And there's no more clear information.

1331
01:58:49,919 --> 01:59:05,919
Well, in the you mean you mean death on your deathbed is because you can experience the collapse of your world, of your love, of medieval science, of all these things.

1332
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:17,199
And what you can't experience what's special about what happens on your deathbed is that it wipes you out even more completely.

1333
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:20,079
I mean, I had something written about that, but I didn't talk about it.

1334
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:25,600
It looks like there's something that has to be around even after your world collapses.

1335
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:32,159
And that's this minimal thing of minus and that it is and has to be.

1336
01:59:32,160 --> 01:59:35,759
Those are the two ways he describes minimal diezo.

1337
01:59:35,759 --> 01:59:41,759
And what happens in, so to speak, everything kind of death, which really wipes you out.

1338
01:59:41,759 --> 01:59:49,039
You even get wiped out as a the that it is and has to be and a minus and so forth.

1339
01:59:49,039 --> 01:59:57,999
That there's important in a funny way because that shows that there is something special about this paradigm case of what happens to you on your deathbed.

1340
01:59:57,999 --> 02:00:11,719
But it seems that it should we we always pay pay attention to that if we're looking for a general ontological, structural understanding of death, which shouldn't emphasize with the kind of terminalness of death.

1341
02:00:11,719 --> 02:00:18,200
Because you can have terminal death for cultures and for science too, but they're not as terminal as what happens to people on their deathbed.

1342
02:00:18,200 --> 02:00:21,319
They just don't get another chance to have another world.

1343
02:00:21,879 --> 02:00:31,879
Okay, so it looks like there are, and there are probably more, sort of, asymmetries that get him into trouble that he should take this event on the deathbed as the paradigm case.

1344
02:00:31,879 --> 02:00:35,079
And you put your finger on the main one, I think.

1345
02:00:35,079 --> 02:00:37,159
And yeah, okay, Eugene gets the last word.

1346
02:00:37,160 --> 02:00:37,799
That's fine with me.

1347
02:00:37,799 --> 02:00:38,839
We still have four minutes.

1348
02:00:39,639 --> 02:00:39,959
Good.

1349
02:00:39,959 --> 02:00:41,879
We need a final trenching thing.

1350
02:00:42,120 --> 02:00:43,560
So let's hope this is it.

1351
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:46,839
The bullet is an opportunity.

1352
02:00:46,999 --> 02:00:48,039
Okay, well, let's see that.

1353
02:00:48,039 --> 02:00:49,959
Of death may now be defined.

1354
02:00:49,959 --> 02:00:51,560
Death is the end of Dasein.

1355
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:57,959
The Dasein's own most possibility, non-relational, certain, post-definite, not to be outstripped.

1356
02:00:57,959 --> 02:01:04,039
Death is a Dasein's end in the being of its entity towards this end.

1357
02:01:04,039 --> 02:01:05,240
That's the full final.

1358
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:06,679
No, that's the full thing.

1359
02:01:06,999 --> 02:01:15,799
Death is, and it's the same thing that gets spelled out with all that with anxiety thrown in, you mean, when I said, is that before or after that other one?

1360
02:01:15,799 --> 02:01:19,239
No, it's the same thing that comes up on 311, in other words.

1361
02:01:19,240 --> 02:01:19,959
Is that right?

1362
02:01:20,280 --> 02:01:20,839
No.

1363
02:01:20,839 --> 02:01:22,280
Well, maybe not.

1364
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:24,279
Let's stop and think about this a minute.

1365
02:01:24,280 --> 02:01:34,359
I think what's interesting is one of them, the topic 303, is about some definition of what death is.

1366
02:01:34,360 --> 02:01:37,879
And the topic 311 is about anticipatory resoluteness.

1367
02:01:37,879 --> 02:01:40,360
It's about how you live that structure.

1368
02:01:40,600 --> 02:01:41,480
You write that down.

1369
02:01:41,480 --> 02:01:47,959
So if 303 is about the structure of death, then that means 311 is about dying, as we put it on the board.

1370
02:01:47,959 --> 02:01:48,440
How you live it.

1371
02:01:48,919 --> 02:01:51,360
Yeah, three eleven is the authentic one.

1372
02:01:50,600 --> 02:01:53,119
Yeah, right?

1373
02:01:53,120 --> 02:01:53,600
Okay.

1374
02:01:51,320 --> 02:01:58,239
And three oh three is the structure that uh authentic dying has to will.

1375
02:01:59,039 --> 02:02:01,520
That is anticipatory resoluteness.

1376
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:02,239
Okay.

1377
02:02:02,240 --> 02:02:04,560
Did that did you write that down?

1378
02:02:04,879 --> 02:02:06,079
Okay, good.

1379
02:02:06,079 --> 02:02:07,600
So for your next week.
